WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 2011

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Government Organization, Efficiency
and Financial Management,
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:56 p.m., in
room 2203, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Todd Russell
Platts (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Present: Representatives Platts, Lankford, Amash, Gosar,
Towns, Cooper, Connolly, and Norton.
Staff present: Michael R. Bebeau, assistant clerk; Molly
Boyl, parliamentarian; Katelyn E. Christ, research analyst;
Gwen D'Luzansky, assistant clerk; Linda Good, chief clerk;
Hudson T. Hollister, counsel; Tabetha C. Mueller, professional
staff member; Ronald Allen, minority staff assistant; Beverly
Britton Fraser, minority counsel; Carla Hultberg, minority
chief clerk; and Suzanne Sachsman Grooms, minority chief
counsel.
Mr. Platts. This committee will come to order.
I certainly would like to welcome my fellow Members, as
well as our witnesses and guests, to this first hearing of our
Subcommittee on Government Organization, Efficiency and
Financial Management. I certainly am honored, Mr. Chairman, to
be working with you again. For those who don't know, when I was
last in the majority and had the privilege of chairing this
subcommittee, Mr. Towns was my ranking member for those 4
years; and when he went into the majority, I got to be his
ranking member. So we are playing musical chairs here, but the
same commitment of working together for just good government
issues. So, again, I am delighted to be reunited with you.
I am going to offer an abbreviated opening statement
because we appreciate our witnesses' patience in holding down
the fort here while we finished up votes on the floor. But we
are anxious to get your testimony.
Our focus here today is really to look at a specific issue:
financial information of the Federal Government, and
particularly how that information is reported and then acted
upon, and specifically the Consolidated Financial Report and
how we can make it more useful. The question we are asking is
how we take that information and make it more useful not just
to Congress, but to the American people. And certainly given
the deficit spending that we see year in and year out and a $14
trillion debt, we know the American people care deeply about
this issue, about how we are handling their money, responsibly
or not.
I want to certainly applaud the Federal Accounting
Standards Advisory Board for taking a very important first step
in convening a task force to look at the Federal financial
reporting model and how we can improve that model and make it
more beneficial to, again, the public, as well as Members of
Congress.
Delighted to have three wonderful witnesses here today.
First, Mr. Tom Allen, Chairman of FASAB. I understand this is
the first time that FASAB has been invited to testify before
Congress. We are glad to have you here.
Mr. Jonathan Breul, executive director of the IBM Center
for The Business of Government. And we are pleased to have you
testifying before the subcommittee again. Mr. Towns and I
certainly benefited from your expertise in the 108th and 109th
sessions of Congress, and know we will again benefit and
blessed by your information and your expertise.
Finally, Mr. Mike Hettinger, executive director with Grant
Thornton. It is really great to see you here on the other side
of the table. For those of you who don't know, Mike was our
subcommittee staff director for 4 years and did an outstanding
job, as well as other positions here on the Hill, and kind of
brings the perspective of both a staff person, as well as now
in the private sector.
As we speak, the Government Accountability Office is
releasing its biannual high risk list. Many of the issues
identified by GAO have to do with sound financial management,
more likely a lack thereof. Though this may seem somewhat dry,
some of the topics our subcommittee will deal with, it is
incredibly important. Nothing is more important than being
effective stewards of the taxpayers' funds, particularly in
difficult financial times as we see facing our Nation today.
This hearing will set the stage for our agenda over the
coming 2 years and will especially provide us an opportunity as
subcommittee members to prepare for our next hearing, when we
will have Treasury, OMB, and GAO before us to testify about the
Consolidated Financial Reports, and what we hope to glean from
you is ideas we can share with those witnesses in a few weeks
and get their input on your recommendations of how we can make
the information more valuable and useful to all parties. That
hearing will be on March 9th.
With that, I am going to submit the rest of my statement
for the record and yield to Mr. Towns, if you would like to
make an opening statement.
Mr. Towns. Mr. Chairman, I am going to place my statement
into the record, and I want to get to the witnesses.
[The prepared statement of Hon. Edolphus Towns follows:]

Mr. Platts. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
All Members will have 7 days to submit written statements
for the record.
We will now go to our witnesses. It is the policy of the
subcommittee to always swear in our witnesses. If I could ask
you to stand and raise your right hands.
[Witnesses sworn.]
Mr. Platts. Thank you. Appreciate your affirmation.
And we will begin, Mr. Allen, with your testimony and,
again, thanks for your presence here and sharing your
expertise.

STATEMENTS OF THOMAS ALLEN, CHAIRMAN, THE FEDERAL ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS ADVISORY BOARD; JONATHAN D. BREUL, EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR, IBM CENTER FOR THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT; AND
MICHAEL J. HETTINGER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GRANT THORNTON LLP

STATEMENT OF THOMAS ALLEN

Mr. Allen. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Congressman
Towns. I appreciate the opportunity to testify today. I want to
convey five key messages in my comments.
The first of those is that citizens want to receive
directly information about their government' finances. The
second of those is that accrual-based financial statements do
contain information that is a good indication of the current
financial health of the government and of future financial
health.
The third issue is that the Federal Government is such a
complex and large organization that it is challenging to convey
its financial information in an easily understood manner. The
fourth key point is that Internet tools can help in overcoming
these challenges, and the other witnesses will talk about that.
No. 5, the task force developed a series of recommendations
that will be considered in the coming months by FASAB and
others to better improve Federal financial reporting.
Exceptional work has gone into improving Federal financial
reporting since the passage of the Chief Financial Officers Act
in 1990. The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board,
FASAB, plays a key role by providing generally accepted
accounting principles, referred to as GAAP standards, and has
been recognized by the accounting profession as meeting the
criteria necessary for a standard-setting body. Accrual-based
financial reporting standards issued by FASAB call for
recognizing commitments and obligations as they occur, rather
than when cash may flow in or out of the Federal Government.
This same measure applies to all companies or organizations in
the United States that have audited financial statements.
Since the Federal Government has, for a number of years,
prepared accrual-based financial statements, I decided to look
back 10 years, to fiscal 2000, to see if accrual-based
information was helpful in better understanding the financial
condition of the government at that time and to see if that
financial information was of predictive value in looking
forward. As you know, fiscal 2000 is remembered as the last of
the great surplus years with a $237 billion budget surplus, and
fiscal 2000 was a very positive year when compared to more
recent fiscal years.
However, information gleaned from the financial statements
and the disclosures indicated that even though there were cash
surpluses in the years from 2008 to 2010, the debt, subject to
the debt limit, actually increased by $152 billion during that
time. This increase is attributable to the intragovernmental
debt, which is issued when Social Security and other trust fund
debt are not needed to pay benefits for that period and are
loaned to the government. The real financial stress for the
government would come in future years, as those intragovernment
borrowings needed to be repaid.
To discover when repayment may be necessary, I looked
further. I looked at the financial statements and back on page
56 I found stewardship information talking about the present
value of long-term actuarial projections called actuarial
deficits. It was $13 trillion in fiscal year 2000, and
increasing by an average of $2 to $3 trillion each of those
years. These amounts are not reflected in the balance sheet or
operating statement of the Federal Government, but they do
impact the financial condition of the Federal Government. The
financial statements in 2000 included the message from then
Comptroller David Walker noting the unsustainability of those
programs and the need to reform them at the earliest
opportunity.
These comments are not to imply any inappropriateness of
the above-stated transactions or noncompliance with Federal
GAAP but, rather, to note that there was information to help
financial statement readers better understand the broad
financial condition of the government at that time, including
fiscal challenges that would need to be dealt with in the
future. However, citizens and other readers would probably have
difficulty in understanding these transactions and what the
numbers in those financial statements represented.
Despite the much progress that has been made, FASAB has
recognized the difficulty of communicating often complex
Federal financial information and the need to improve the
understandability of Federal financial reporting. The question
of how to better communicate this financial information has
also been a challenge.
Accordingly, the Federal reporting model project was added
to the FASAB agenda. Beginning in the year 2008, we undertook a
user study. We found that citizens do want to know more about
the financial health of the Federal Government, but they often
did not know that financial statements even existed and, when
shown the financial statements, had trouble understanding what
they meant.
Our sponsors from Treasury, OMB, and GAO are also seeking
to better inform citizens regarding the financial condition of
the Federal Government. Their efforts have resulted in the
schedules of key amounts in the financial statement management
discussion analysis. These schedules are illustrated in my
written comments.
For fiscal year 2000, additional long-term projections have
been added to the financial report. These long-term projections
help inform readers about the challenge of continuing current
financial policy without change. The task force provided a list
of 10 recommendations for consideration by FASAB and its
sponsors. I want to thank them for the expertise they brought
together and their excellent recommendations. I am hopeful that
these recommendations and our other efforts will lead to a
better informed citizenry.
I look forward to answering your questions. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF JONATHAN D. BREUL

Mr. Breul. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member
Towns. I am pleased to have the opportunity to testify this
afternoon regarding the report of the FASAB Financial Reporting
Task Force.
Late last year the government released its annual financial
report, and although that report presents information that is
important to citizens as they form judgments about the fiscal
future of the government under current policy, it is unlikely
that Americans are even aware of its existence or its
availability. And because the Nation is currently engaged in
crucial debates about the appropriate role in the near term and
the long-term fiscal imbalance, the annual financial report is
now more relevant than ever before to citizens, political
leaders, and analysts.
Further, the recent celebration of the 20th anniversary of
the Chief Financial Officers Act offers a clear reminder of the
considerable improvement and financial reporting over the past
two decades. However, the challenge of effectively delivering
that information to users remains unfinished.
I served as a member of the FASAB task force. The objective
of that task force was to increase users' access, their
understanding, and their use of financial information, while
avoiding costly requirements that do not add value. To do so,
the task force focused on the Consolidated Financial Report,
largely because that is where we judged the public would start
in order to learn about the fiscal health of the Federal
Government as a whole.
And the FASAB user studies, as Mr. Allen indicated, showed
that citizens and, indeed, many executives and managers in
government, have difficulty understanding the information in
that report. Indeed, many of whom believe the document is
written by accountants or economists, which it is.
Consequently, they believe the government should adopt a Web-
based method of communicating information about the fiscal
condition and performance of the Federal Government.
Since four of the task force's recommendations focus on
methods to enhance this communication of governmentwide
financial information, I want to devote the balance of my
remarks just to highlighting those four items.
The first task force recommendation was to move away from
paper-based reporting and to adopt an electronic Web-based
reporting method. The public relies increasingly on digital
devices, whether it is BlackBerrys and other devices which we
all are carrying, and interactive media to obtain their
information on demand. Accordingly, financial reporting
information needs to switch from a paper-based static reporting
model to an electronic, dynamic, and readily available online
availability.
The task force's second recommendation urged FASAB to
explore how to best report additional governmentwide program
performance in the management discussion and analysis [MD&A],
section of the consolidated report or in other electronic
governmentwide presentations. The Nation is engaged in
deliberations to determine the Federal Government's future role
in the economy and society, and program performance measures
presented in the consolidated report could potentially help
inform that debate, especially if they were structured to
provide such information about the government's effectiveness
in achieving its planned goals, as well as the economy and
efficiency of government operations.
And I should point out that this recommendation now very
nicely aligns with the recently enacted GPRA Modernization Act,
which, as you know, strengthens the existing requirements for
the reporting of performance information and calls upon the
Office of Management and Budget to develop a governmentwide
performance plan.
The third recommendation of the task force is to present
net cost and spending by function. The current statement of net
costs is presented by agency. FASAB focus group discussions
with citizens indicated that users are much more likely to
focus on the government's functions, such as health care,
social services, national security, those kind of functions,
rather than the agencies which are administering them. And, as
you know, that is the kind of information which the budget is
currently presented and it is a breakdown which many in
Congress and the Federal Government are already familiar and
use on a regular basis.
The task force's final recommendation was to establish a
central Web site for Federal financial information and to
aggressively inform the public of its availability. Ultimately,
the success of the previous recommendations requires making the
public aware of these financial reports and the information
they provide. A central Web site would enable the Federal
Government to take advantage of existing technology and to help
identify improvements that may be needed.
The static paper-based reports that the Federal Government
delivers today contain important information about the fiscal
health of the Federal Government; however, those reports are
not presented or available in a way that makes them easy to use
or easy to understand, thereby limiting their impact. The
government needs to use modern technology to inform the
presentation of that information and adapt to the way users
want to receive the information and are much more likely to use
that information.
Thank you.

STATEMENT OF MICHAEL J. HETTINGER

Mr. Hettinger. Chairman Platts, Ranking Member Towns, and
members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to
testify today. As you mentioned in your opening remarks, I
served from 2003 to 2006 as the Staff Director of this
subcommittee. I am currently an executive director with Grant
Thornton's Global Public Sector Practice, but I am here as a
witness today based on my experience serving as a member of the
financial reporting model task force to the FASAB.
I applaud the committee for holding this hearing today and
for your ongoing interest in government efficiency and
effectiveness.
Since the enactment of the CFO Act in 1990, we have seen a
steady and significant improvement in the quality and
availability of information about the Federal Government's
finances. That information, contained in individual agency
financial statements, Performance and Accountability Reports,
the Consolidated Financial Report, and other reports, provides
a sound baseline for decisionmakers and citizens alike to
better understand how the Federal Government is using their
hard-earned tax dollars.
The issuance of the CFR in mid-December each year should
set off a chain of events where Congress, the administration
and the general public have an opportunity to look at the
financial condition of the government prior to the issuance of
the President's Budget. All too often, however, the issuance of
the CFR goes largely unnoticed.
About 6 years ago, when I worked on this subcommittee, I
participated in an effort led by the Department of Treasury to
improve the usefulness of the CFR. That effort, among other
things, led to the development of the Citizen's Guide to the
Financial Report of the U.S. Government. This document provides
an effective high-level summary of the highlights of that
year's CFR, useful for citizens seeking a basic understanding,
but not necessarily useful for Congress or other
decisionmakers.
Last spring, FASAB conducted a user needs study to assess
the financial information needs of the Congress. This study
follows a mid-1980 study by GAO. The GAO Federal Government
Reporting Study conducted in 1986 found, with respect to
legislators, that Congress needed specialized agency
information for the conducting of committee business, but
summary level information for use in communicating with
constituents, providing a means for the Federal Government to
demonstrate its accountability.
The spring 2010 FASAB study confirmed that many of these
same needs are applicable today and fall into four broad
categories: budgetary integrity, operating performance,
stewardship, and systems and control.
From my experience, these broad categories accurately
reflect the information needs of Congress. Members and staff
attain this information from a variety of sources, including
the news media, agencies directly, legislative support
organizations such as CRS, inspectors general, or via your own
research and oversight.
There is also a wealth of information contained in
statutorily required reports, including the CFR, as well as
agency PARs, and I believe Congress and the general public
would benefit greatly from making that information more readily
available and understandable.
With the creation of Web sites like USASpending.gov,
Data.gov, the Federal Procurement Data System, and private Web
sites looking at the financial condition of the government,
citizens now have access to more information than ever before
and clearly more interest in the information contained in those
sites. Ease of use and the relevance of the information housed
on these sites drives visitors. However, the completeness and
accuracy of the data contained within is essential for those
government-owned sites.
The mission of the Financial Reporting Model Task Force, as
Jonathan mentioned in his statement, to increase users' access
to and understanding and use of financial information in the
CFR, while avoiding costly requirements that don't add value,
sought to address this very issue. I was pleased to be a part
of this effort because I believe that mission gets to the heart
of where we stand on Federal financial management 20 years
after the enactment of the CFO Act. We have a great deal of
information, but that information is not understandable by the
general public or useful for decisionmakers.
The Task Force, as Jonathan also mentioned, makes 10 key
recommendations, ranging from adopting a Web-based reporting
model, to presenting a functional statement of net cost, to
establishing a Federal financial information Web site and
raising awareness of the availability of Federal financial
information.
Recommendation 1, asking Treasury to move away from a
paper-based reporting model by adopting an electronic, Web-
based reporting model, is essential if we are move in the
direction of improving the availability and transparency of
government information. This recommendation, combined with
recommendation 10, which calls for the establishment of a
Federal financial information Web site to help raise awareness
of the government's financial information, go a long way toward
improving the ease of access to information.
Recommendation 3, regarding a functional statement of net
cost, would present net cost and spending by function, as
Jonathan mentioned, such as health care, rather than by agency,
such as HHS. This recommendation I believe is essential if we
are to truly understand the cost of government.
And there are a number of other recommendations that I have
highlighted in my written statement, and I will skip over those
because I think they have been addressed by the other
witnesses.
I will close by saying there is a wealth of really
important financial information contained in the CFR, as well
as in agency financial statements, but to make that information
relevant, it must be timely, accurate, understandable, and
usable.
Thank you again for the opportunity to be here today, and I
am happy to answer any questions that Members may have.

Mr. Platts. Thank you again for the testimony of all three
of you, and your written statements will be made part of the
record as well.
I am delighted to have been joined by one of our freshman
Members, Congressman Gosar, from Arizona. Delighted to have you
with us on committee. And returning senior Member, Mr. Cooper,
from Tennessee. So thanks for both of you being with us.
We are going to do a round of questions of basically 5
minutes and rotate, and then if we have need for a second,
third, fourth round, we will come back around.
Mr. Allen, I would like to start. In your role with FASAB,
you certainly, in setting accounting standards for the Federal
Government, you have to kind of please a lot of different
communities; the bond rating agencies, auditors, citizens,
Members of Congress, Federal managers. When we talk about some
of the recommendations that the task force has made and going
to a Web-based reporting model for financial statements, going
to that model seems to be kind of mutually beneficial to all
communities, whether it be Members of Congress or the public at
large.
But is it different when we talk about how the information
that is on that Web-based model is reported? Is there a
difference in what is going to be useful to the public at large
versus how it needs to be presented for Members of Congress or
other policymakers within the Federal Government? Are they
mutually exclusive in how the information is presented within
the Web model?
Mr. Allen. Clearly, as you indicated, the needs of somebody
who is managing an agency are probably very specific. They have
to be very timely, in fact, real-time; they can't wait until
after the end of the year to prepare financial statements.
So I think the recommendations are very positive in terms
of electronic data base allows you to actually drill down and
access the level of detail that you want. There are challenges
of getting it real-time for some people and others who look at
it at the end of the year and say, OK, here is a broad
overview.
But the efficiencies that need to take place in the Federal
Government that I think would be significant is if we had the
same financial statements that provided the information to
manage were also the same financial systems that were used to
generate the numbers that would prepare the financial
statements after the end of the year and would have audit
coverage. That gives credibility to everyone who is using that
system.
The challenge right now is often that is not the case in
agencies. So that is one of the things that I would encourage
you and your committee to encourage and look forward to. But,
yes, the technology and the drill-down capacity would be
beneficial.
Mr. Platts. And what you envision when you talk about the
drill-down opportunities is you have the CFR and kind of the
overall report, but if it is a Web-based model, then you can
link through that Web-based model down into NASA or DOD or
Commerce and get into the nitty-gritty of that individual
department or agency's financials pretty easily.
Mr. Allen. And even beyond what they are now reporting,
because what we heard from citizens, for example, everyone was
interested in the cost of defense, but what they were
interested in is a lot lower detail than anything that is
reported now. They wanted to know the cost of a war in a
particular country or something like that.
So I think as we gather the data electronically--now,
obviously there is going to be some work in sort of how you cut
and dice that information, but you would clearly be able to
answer the detailed questions people want. Not too many people
say just tell me the total cost of defense and I am happy to
know that.
Mr. Platts. Is it fair to say that what FASAB and the task
force recommendations are about is we already have right to
know laws and we have a right to know the information, but it
is getting access to it in a usable, time-sensitive manner?
Your recommendation is not changing the right to know, but the
access to what you do have a right to know, and through a
better resource tool such as a Web-based model.
Mr. Allen. Yes. That is a very good summary. Thank you.
Mr. Platts. Mr. Hettinger and Mr. Breul, when the task
force looked at major recommendations, what was maybe the most
significant limitation in the way we are doing it now and was
it lack of data or how we are presenting the data, or just the
public's lack of knowledge that the data is out there for them
to get and use?
Mr. Breul. The Consolidated Financial Report is not a best
seller. You couldn't go to the local bookstore and find one I
recall one of our meetings we looked around and we had a hard
time finding one at our meeting.
So I think the problems are pretty basic. They have to do
with the availability of that information and then, second, the
presentation, the readability and understanding. It is a public
document full of spreadsheets, and they are hard-printed
spreadsheets, they are not searchable, they are not readily
understandable, and they are not the kind of thing that an
average citizen could quickly lay their eyes on and understand;
it takes some attention and some skill.
Mr. Hettinger. I think that certainly sums up the general
thoughts on it. In a way, it is almost too much information. As
Jonathan talked about, if you were to pull one out--and I am
guessing no one has one--but if you were to pull one out, it is
this big and it has an awful lot of detailed information in
there, and your average citizen is not going to look at that
document and, quite honestly, understand much of anything that
is in it.
What we tried to do as we looked at this electronic
reporting model is say, OK, what can we put at a summary level
that citizens will use, but then those who are decisionmakers
and others will be able to drill down deeper and find the type
of information they need. I think that is what interesting
about both the Treasury effort I mentioned from 5 or 6 years
ago, as well as the user needs study, because there is a
balance.
One of the things we learned in that Treasury effort is the
bond rating agencies, Moody's and Standard & Poor's and those
folks, are actually very interested in the detailed data that
is contained in the Consolidated Financial Report. Your average
citizen doesn't want to see the same type of information that
Moody's and Standard & Poor's want to see. So we try to provide
a vehicle that will allow for some summary level information,
but then a drill-down that won't overwhelm people.
Mr. Platts. Before I yield to the ranking member, I think
what we have seen over the years, and Mr. Cooper certainly has
been a leader in trying to raise awareness within the public at
large of the importance of these issues, and, as Mr. Breul
said, it is not necessarily a best seller, the CFR, but it is
really one of the most critical reports that is done for the
American people when it comes to how we are spending their
money.
And I have joked in the past, when I have last chaired the
subcommittee, in getting attention to this issue of the
information and access to the information. You know, I have
gotten to the point where I think that maybe we need, along
with the three of you experts, is to have maybe a baseball
player who is doing steroids be here to show an interest in the
Consolidated Financial Reports. That would help generate
interest in this very important information. So we are going to
keep trying to raise awareness and work with you and others on
better access to this critical important information.
With that, I yield to the ranking member, Mr. Towns.
Mr. Towns. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. When you get
that baseball player, just make certain he is not a Yankee.
Mr. Platts. Well, as a diehard Orioles fan, no problem
there.
Mr. Towns. Let me again thank you very much for holding
this hearing and let me begin by we keep talking about the word
user, user-friendly. What can we do to sort of make this more
user-friendly, so people can sort of understand it in terms of
Members of Congress and the general public in particular? What
can we do? Do you have any ideas of some things that we might
be able to do to make it a little more user-friendly?
Mr. Hettinger. I will throw out a couple ideas. I mean,
obviously, as Jonathan mentioned in his prepared testimony,
people get information quicker, they get information
electronically primarily. It is one of these things, in this
age, the information comes so much quicker.
So I think recognizing that information comes in different
forms, the government, FASAB, and some of the recommendations
in the task force, but primarily the Department of Treasury
issues a report, need to recognize the different ways that
people get information. And that moves you in a lot of
different ways in the recommendations, I think, to go to an
electronic reporting model just like that.
It is important to recognize this is not information
contained in the Consolidated Financial Report that everyone
has an interest in. When you look at USASpending and some of
the other Web sites that are out there, there is very specific
information to congressional districts and spending that goes
on in those congressional districts, and I personally believe a
lot of the information and the reason people are driven to
those sites is because they want to see how much of their tax
dollars are getting returned to their own congressional
district. The information in here is a little bit different.
So not everyone is going to have an interest in it, but if
you get it out there electronically, usable, findable, if it
pops up on Google when you do a search for the Federal
Financial Report or U.S. Government Financial Report, folks are
going to start to pay more attention.
Mr. Breul. Let me offer two quick suggestions. One is to
use many more charts and graphs and colorful displays. The
document right now has many spreadsheets and tables, as you
might expect, but USA Today, the newspapers, you read the front
page of the paper today, bars and charts and graphs are often a
more effective way of communicating, particularly to citizens.
So more use of devices like that would be helpful. And, again,
the Web-based tools would be helpful in that regard.
The second and also in the Web-based category is this idea
of having it machine-readable. Right now that is a hard
document in which you have usually it is called a PDF file,
which is a true copy of the document reproduced for you in hard
form or viewable on the screen.
But if it was machine-readable data, such as Recovery.gov
had been in the past for the Recovery Act money, you could
search by a county or a title or a period of time and come up
with the data that particularly corresponded to your particular
interests, and would make it a much more user-friendly and user
customized tool for people to begin to dig in. And I think that
is indeed why Recovery.gov has been so popular; it is getting
millions, hundreds of millions of hits, because citizens are
able to dig in, where the financial statements don't have that
ability right now and could change.
Mr. Allen. I think, Congressman, one of the challenges is
that even people who understand how to read financial
statements, when they look at the financial statements of the
Federal Government, it is confusing to them. Traditional
financial statements have a very clear bottom line and they
have a clear operating statement that shows how much that
financial position changed in a period of time.
Now, because of the complexities, and it starts with the
way things are budgeted, and when you look at the financial
statements of the Federal Government, you see I have
information on social insurance, it is in a separate financial
statement; I have information on long-term projections, that is
in a separate financial statement. I really don't have a bottom
line. If you were to ask me how did we do last year, just like
in my testimony, my written comments. If I ask you how did we
do in 2007, off the top of your head, you would say great. But,
in reality, once you start looking at some of the information
that I laid out, how great was it? And that is something that
you would start asking yourself in your mind. It was great, but
we were increasing our debt. How do those two things reconcile
together?
So that is the challenge that we have with the complexity
of the Federal Government, and that probably would require more
than just standards that we would set; that would require the
concerted effort of Congress and the way they approach things
and the way they budget things and the way it is reported to
citizens. That would be a very comprehensive challenge, but
would be a challenge worthy to at least look at to get to an
understandable bottom line.
Mr. Platts. Dr. Gosar.
Mr. Gosar. Thank you very much, gentlemen, for being here
today. It is a two-way street. I think it is also from the
legislators to having quick synopses of what we are actually
seeing and being able to convey that to people as well. The
non-profits do this very, very well in some cases, where you
see for every dollar we put in, how many cents are actually
derived to the source that we are trying to adjudicate for.
So with that in mind, I think we have to look
introspectively, and from your perspective what is the best way
from an accounting perspective to determine if a government
program is using its dollars efficiently?
Mr. Allen. Do you want to talk about the recommendations on
uniting the performance information with the financial? Do you
want to go ahead and address that initially or was that
directed to me?
Mr. Gosar. All of you.
Mr. Breul. I will just start it off, then. The second of
the recommendations was to include performance information;
that cost alone was not a sufficient perspective, you really
need to know what you got for that money. And, again, that is
why I mentioned the recent enactment of the GPRA Modernization
Act, which is a renewed attention by the administration and
Congress that you need a complete picture of not only what we
spend, but what we are getting for that spending, and
understanding the performance and results that are being paid
for with this money during that particular period of time. To
me, that is the essential pairing of information that is needed
to really make an informed judgment of whether we are getting
the value that we are expecting.
Mr. Hettinger. I will associate myself with Jonathan's
remarks. There are lots of ways to try to understand how a
Federal program, whether it is achieving its results. When I
worked on the subcommittee, Chairman Platts and I worked
together to try to promote a bill which looked somewhat like
what the GPRA Modernization Act looked like.
That bill changed over time. The intent was to take a
programmatic approach to looking at the performance of programs
basically line by line, program by program, building on the
Bush administration's program assessment rating tool; and I
think it is effective.
What you then have to do, as Jonathan talked about, is to
tie that program, performance information back to budget; and
that is really the key in assessing the performance, but then
demonstrating some budgetary changes as a result of a program's
performance. Easier said than done in a lot of ways, I think,
but that is how I would approach it. That is how I think it has
been approached. And there have been many, as you know, many
efforts by Congress and others over the years to try to
understand exactly how effective these programs are being.
Mr. Allen. I would add I guess you talked about not-for-
profit organizations, and even there the standard setter
identified what it is you need to report, cost of raising money
versus program services you are delivering. But there is no
requirement from an accounting standpoint of tell us how
effective you are, so it is a challenge.
In fact, that probably is an area that is best addressed by
those who are managing those programs, the agencies themselves.
And I think from a standard setter standpoint we can say you
should include program information. But how to effectively
present it is probably going to reside with those agencies,
with models that may be presented by the task force or others.
Mr. Gosar. A followup question, because I want to make sure
that we are getting the right information in regards to the
proper accounting. So, in your opinion as accountants, and
following through and financial statements, in last year's
health care bill, did Congress follow its due process in
properly accounting for funds and cost analysis in a
transparent and accurate accounting method?
Mr. Allen. I don't see the 10-foot pole, but my
understanding is that there will be a presentation of those
people who prepared the financial statements for 2010 and who
audited those financial statements, and that will be a
presentation that they believe is most appropriately addressed
by them, as opposed to us as standards setter. Is that a
bailout? It is.
Mr. Platts. And, Doctor, sorry, that is March 9th when we
will have Treasury and OMB before us.
Mr. Gosar. I yield back the rest of my time.
Mr. Platts. Thank you.
Before I yield to Mr. Cooper, is it safe to say, when we
talk about getting more performance information in the report
and more easily understood, that if you go to that Web-based
model and have more performance, one of the true intents of
moving the CFR up into December is so that it can be used in
drafting the subsequent year's budget? In the current model it
doesn't lend itself very well, especially the lack of
performance and easy access to performance information. Is that
a fair statement?
Mr. Breul. I think that is true. And I would simply point
out that with the new GPRA Modernization Act, at least for the
high level, high priority goals, the Congress asked for
quarterly reporting so in fact you could begin to buildup a
more periodic reporting and have information not only at the
end of the year, but during the year, when there is some
opportunity to make some course corrections or changes if you
want to accelerate or decline the trend that you are currently
on. So I think that is exactly right.
Mr. Platts. Mr. Cooper.
Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Let's be honest. This is one of the most important and most
boring hearings in congressional history. We are lucky if this
is even on C-SPAN 3. There are about maybe 20 live people in
this room, and half of them are asleep, because we are not
speaking a language the average American voter understands. So
let me put the cookies on a low shelf and, especially, I would
like to get Dr. Gosar's attention on this, because as a new
member perhaps he can rescue us.
We are now sitting in a room of the only large enterprise
left in America that is exempt from using real accrual
accounting. This violates the first plank of the Contract with
America back in 1994-95, in which Congress was supposed to live
by the laws it passes for the rest of the people. It is my
understanding that every enterprise in this country with
revenues of about $5 million has to use, in addition to cash
accounting, also real accrual accounting.
But somehow the Federal Government is exempt. We are
hypocritical. Now, why is that? Well, first of all, I still
can't find one lobbying enterprise in this town, and Lord knows
there are thousands of them, there are between 30 and 60
lobbyists for every one of us. Not one of those folks, to my
knowledge, is for real accrual accounting for the Federal
Government. Isn't that interesting?
When the average civic club member back home has to use
real accrual accounting for their business, whether they are
for-profit or non-profit. State and local governments have to
use real accrual accounting. It prevents them from hiding their
unfunded pension liabilities and things like that. So why isn't
the Federal Government using it?
This is a mystery that you gentlemen can help us solve,
because while we are talking here about electronic display of
information or fine-tuning these facts, there is not a lack of
information, there is a willful blindness to that information.
The rating agencies, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, have
already said maybe we have 1 or 2 years left before we face a
possible downgrade of the Treasury bond, because we are so
mismanaging our Nation's finances.
Now, how are we mismanaging it? According to cash
accounting, our debt is on the order of $14 trillion. But if
you look at our unfunded obligations, programs like Medicare,
Social Security, things like that, it is more like unfunded
obligations of 50, 60, who knows how many trillion dollars?
Many times larger. Our debt this year isn't at $1\1/2\ trillion
or so, it is more like $2 trillion. So when are we going to get
real on these numbers? And that is why I think it is important
to be somewhat blunt, be simple without being simplistic to
help the average American understand the situation we are in,
because it is very convenient here today for Federal officials
to hide the real numbers.
You are talking about electronic displays for the average
citizen. The Treasury Department has never held a press
conference about the release of the Financial Report of the
U.S. Government. Our own Treasury officials in both parties,
whether it was the Bush administration or the Obama
administration. They deliberately hide the release of this
document, the only one compiled according to law passed by
Senator John Glenn, that uses the real numbers.
So forgive me for being frustrated, but the business mantra
is if you can't measure it, you can't manage it. We are
refusing to measure the dimensions of our problem. A historian
will look back years hence and say they had the tools to do a
good job, but they refused to use the tools. The tool is real
accrual accounting, because that enables us to see what is not
only in the national checkbook, but what is on the national
credit card.
So I know Mr. Allen knows these issues cold. I appreciate
his great service on FASAB. I appreciate the other pioneers who
have worked on it, but somehow we have to break the gridlock on
this issue. Let's find one business lobby in America that is
willing to support real accounting for the Federal Government.
Where is the Chamber of Commerce? Where is the Business
Roundtable? Where is the NFIB? For that matter, where is The
Wall Street Journal? I have a chart in my office, I have had it
for years: What is the debt? What is your share of the debt?
We are using cash numbers. We need the real numbers. And
you gentlemen, while you are doing all the fancy fine-tuning
stuff, you can help us understand the plain, blunt truth. We
are not using honest accounting standards, not using real
accounting standards, not using accrual accounting standards
for the Federal Government. So this is more of a statement than
a question.
I appreciate your efforts, Mr. Chairman, to highlight these
issues, but I think it is important to make this a less boring
and to put the cookies on a low shelf so that perhaps there is
somebody out there in C-SPAN 3 land who will make this a cause
and bring this to light. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Platts. Thank you, Mr. Cooper. Your statement is one of
the reasons I am delighted to be back on the committee with you
and, as I said, your efforts over many years to raise this
very, very important issues. As you say, maybe boring, but
ever, ever important. And look forward to working with you as
we go forward in these 2 years to do a better job in having the
American people truly understand the financial crisis facing
us, because, as you said, the real numbers are tens of
trillions of dollars of unfunded liabilities out there.
Mr. Cooper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Platts. Mr. Connolly.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to
express to you my delight in being on this subcommittee. I
picked a third subcommittee because you were chairing it. So
thank you.
Mr. Platts. I am honored.
Mr. Connolly. And, of course, you can imagine how thrilled
I was that our first hearing was on accounting, a wonderful
subject.
First of all, Mr. Allen, you should know that I was, for a
long time, a consultant for FASB, and I didn't lobby for FASB,
but I helped represent FASB here in Washington, working with
other representatives of yours in a consulting status, and
enjoyed very much working with FASB and going to Connecticut
and debating green eyeshade issues and how they might translate
into public policy.
I want to ask two questions. The first is do you all ever
look, though, at the costs of your decisions? Mr. Allen, for
example, I can't remember the exact number, I used to know it
by heart, but I was in local government for 14 years, and a new
GASB standard added gazillions of dollars to the cost of local
government, or eliminated even the option of expanding benefits
because of the actuarial implications that GASB required us,
all in the name of a new and more transparent accounting
standard.
And I think it depends on where you sit how helpful that
is. And my question is does FASB and do others, and the other
panelists could certainly feel free to comment, ever take into
account the cost implications of your decisions, both on the
Federal and State and local government levels, or, for that
matter, on the private sector?
Mr. Allen. Can I go ahead and start? Well, thank you. It is
nice to see a welcoming face here understanding the challenges
of standard setting. I suspect I know what standard you are
talking about that was passed. That was probably the last
standard that I was involved in before I retired from GASB, and
that probably had to do with recognizing the cost of health
care promises for your employees.
Mr. Connolly. Was that GASB 76 or something like that?
Mr. Allen. Fifty-six, I think. However, when one thinks
about that, what has resulted from that decision? In other
words, as accountants, we try to be non-political; we provide
you information that you make decisions. In that particular
case, we received letters back that were disconcerting: if you
make us report this in our financial statements, they won't
continue that benefit.
And, in fact, in the State of Utah, where I am now a
visiting professor at a university, I don't earn any benefit
for health care because the State of Utah legislators, when
faced with the decision of do I put that on the face of my
financial statements and recognize that, decided that cost was
too great for them to assume.
So when you look at the role of accounting, it isn't to
make decisions about what one should do, but it is to provide
you clearly the information that you have to make a decision
understanding the full cost of that. And I think that is what
Mr. Cooper was also addressing, this issue of you put something
on the face of the financial statement and recognize it. Would
you make the same decision that you would make if you don't
have to put it on the face of the financial statement?
Mr. Connolly. Mr. Allen, if I may, I am not sure that is
really true. When GASB came out with that standard, we didn't
have a choice. The bond rating houses weren't going to accept
our financial statements if we didn't do what you in fact set
out for us. As a result, it wasn't just a matter of making sure
the public knows the transparency of the transaction; that
meant that when I wanted to give, on an annual basis, because
everything is appropriated on an annual basis, that is not an
applied commitment for tomorrow, maybe I wanted to increase
retirees' health care offsets because of the rise in health
care costs, I couldn't just do that on an annual basis, as we
always had done before that new GASB standard, I now had to
account for the actuarial life of each recipient forever. And
that cost suddenly went from whatever it was, X, to 30 times X.
Well, Mr. Cooper may think that is a good thing, but I can
tell you, as someone who spent 14 years managing a county
government that was selected as the best managed in the United
States, we didn't think it was such a good thing. And it hurt
our firefighters and our retirees because we could no longer
provide that extra benefit that they deserved and that they had
earned.
So my point is that this is a two-sided coin, that when you
make certain standards, it has implications and suddenly
jettisons cost upward even though nothing has changed other
than your accounting requirement.
Mr. Allen. And I apologize to any affect that may have
caused to individuals or to organizations. Nevertheless, the
issue becomes not that GASB has any ability to make a
government do anything, like FASAB doesn't have any ability.
The only question was--and many governments still provide that
benefit and still don't fund health care. Most fund pensions;
many still don't fund that health care.
But they do have, on the financial statements, the
recognition of the obligation that is there under a concept
called intergenerational equity. In State and local
governments, that became the driving force that the cost of
someone providing services ought to be recognized in the period
that service is provided, not recognized years later, when
somebody else paid the cost of those services. So that is the
sometimes disconnect that happens between budgeting on a more
cash basis and recognizing that cost on a more accrual basis.
That is the challenge.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you.
My time is up, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Platts. Thank you, Mr. Connolly.
Ms. Norton.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Well, I wanted to be a member of this subcommittee because
I have long had an interest in government efficiency, so that
is one of the things we are supposed to be dealing with and I
hope these reports deal with. I ran a Federal agency with a
very serious underlying mission, but immediately became
interested in the inefficiency of the mechanisms because they
weren't able to deliver the strong substantive mandate they
had.
Now, Mr. Cooper speaks about making what you do and a CFR
that is boring. Anything with numbers alone is always boring.
When I look at a graph, I always read some text, even though a
graph is pretty picturesque. I don't even know if you use
graphs. But the notion of making the work understandable to
laypeople could not be more important today, because when we
hear some of what masquerades in what I can only call
propaganda for what is what is right or wrong with the
government, you can understand that it must be that there is no
objective, understandable information out there.
I mean, some things are a little bit easier to understand
than others, for example, Social Security, where people still
have to be told that the trust fund will last X number of
years; and that does give them some sense, a little bit of an
understanding of Social Security. Although it is kind of lumped
together with everything else that needs cutting, it does need
cutting, but the distinction is an important one.
But if you take another program that I have always found
very, very difficult to understand, which is even more
seriously running out of money, Medicare, I don't think the
average person for whom that means everything has any way to
fasten on whether or not it will--you know, if you are young,
whether or not Social Security will be available; if it is not
there, you know Medicare certainly won't be there. But what you
don't know is Medicare is more seriously running out of money
than Social Security is.
Now, Mr. Allen's testimony, on page 4, mentions a Citizens
Guide to the financial report that began in 2007, and then at
the bottom of the page is the task force necessary still to
make recommendations on how to make this more understandable
and more accessible. What was there about the Citizens Guide
that I take it caused the formation of the task force? Would
you reconcile the notion that there was a Citizens Guide and
what it did, right or wrong, so that we understand why a task
force of experts to increase user understanding, access, etc.,
was later formed?
Mr. Allen. The Citizens Guide was an excellent effort not
by a standards setter, it was by Treasury, OMB, and GAO getting
together, as Mike indicated, and coming up with what they
thought would be a better way to communicate. It has the same
limitations these two gentlemen have talked about, which is I
can look at a summary total of something, but if I want to know
any detail about that, I can't go down to the details to better
understand that. So that----
Ms. Norton. Because?
Mr. Allen. Because I show one number. I may show the
Department of Defense----
Ms. Norton. I see.
Mr. Allen. Well, what if that isn't what I want? I want to
know some detail about that. And that is why this electronic
delivery of information and how to organize the information,
again, back to Mr. Cooper's comment. If you look at some of the
illustrations, the 2004 illustration, for example, that came
from the Treasury Department, it actually side-by-side and then
combined the Social Security and other obligation information,
and that was very pleasing to some people and very
disconcerting to others.
But there has been an attempt to try and provide
information in these reports that help you understand better
the financial statements. All the Citizens Guide comes from the
financial statements. What they are talking about is giving
additional information even beyond the summary information you
see in the financial statements.
Mr. Hettinger. I will say just a couple things. One
interesting thing is the Citizens Guide is a paper-based
document as well, and Jonathan Breul made the point earlier
when the government puts, whether it be the CFR or other
documents, on a Web site, it is a static document; they
essentially copy it, put a PDF up there, and you can read it,
but you may as well be reading the hard copy. And what we are
talking about is trying to get a document on there that you can
go in and work with and drill down and look at this
information, the information that you find important to you,
and really understand that information.
The Citizens Guide is a 10-, 12-, 15-page summary of a 350-
, 400-page Consolidated Financial Report. It is very helpful,
and I was part of the effort when I worked on the subcommittee,
working with the folks at Treasury that came up with the
Citizens Guide model. I thought that was a great first step. I
think what we are suggesting here, and as Tom points out, from
a standards setting standpoint, is that we take it beyond that
to something that gets you better access to more information in
a more understandable, usable fashion.
And as I mentioned in my statement, some of the
recommendations really allow you to understand the true cost of
government by function, not just necessarily by agency, and I
think that is particularly important going forward as you look
at the things that you are looking at.
Mr. Platts. Thank you, Ms. Norton.
Ms. Norton. Thank you.
Mr. Platts. We are going to have a second round, and I will
kick it off.
Mr. Allen, I am going to go back to a little bit of your
work with GASB and setting those accounting standards for State
and local governments. In addition to, I think, as you
referenced, intergenerational equity, are there lessons learned
from your work at GASB with State and local government
reporting that you think we can well apply to the Federal
Government in what we are doing?
Mr. Allen. I guess the first two that come to mind are
probably some that I have already mentioned, the challenge to,
as you know, State and local governments focus very much on
short-term financial resources, and even the thought of adding
these obligations to their financial statement was very
disconcerting, and we sought feedback from the bond rating
agency that basically said what is important isn't what you
report; we already know you have those things and we already
add those up.
What is important is that you clearly communicate where you
are at and then present information that shows where you are
going from there. And I actually think that is applicable to
the Federal Government. I think people who have concerns about
reporting stuff, the point isn't that we don't know there are
obligations are not obligations out there; the point is what
are you doing about it as you go forward. I think that is a
very important focus to look at.
The other was very consistent with the report. We found
that State and local governments report, as Mr. Connolly would
tell you, on a fund-by-fund basis. People didn't want to know
what was in a particular fund; they wanted to know what the
cost of those services were and who paid that cost. So we had
to change the whole operating statement to do that, and that
will be one of the challenges of meeting the cost-based
information that they are talking about.
So, yes, I think we learned the information that people
want about the Federal Government is very similar to what they
wanted about State and local governments.
Mr. Platts. Thank you.
Mr. Breul, the 10 recommendations of the task force, we are
still looking at the budget release this week. Are you aware of
any of those recommendations being incorporated into what has
been put forth by the administration on the 2012 budget?
Mr. Breul. Mr. Chairman, I am not, but I would doubt very
much that there is a cost. In fact, we were hopeful some of
these recommendations would in fact save cost by moving away
from paper-based printing and distribution. And I don't think
any of them really are costers, I think they are pretty much
cost-neutral. And our recommendations were so recent, I would
doubt very much that the OMB has had an opportunity to
incorporate them in any of their thinking quite yet. In fact,
they were made to the FASAB and they will get to OMB shortly
when they come to the next FASAB meeting.
Mr. Platts. OK. Thank you.
Mr. Towns.
Mr. Towns. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Let's talk about how strong the government's financial
statements are for a minute. I guess I will start with you, Mr.
Allen. Your organization sets accounting standards for the
Federal Government. That is accurate, right?
Mr. Allen. Yes.
Mr. Towns. Isn't it true that every year there are
government agencies with financial statements that cannot meet
government standards?
Mr. Allen. Yes. Most of them do. I don't know this last
year, but there is normally maybe three or four that don't. But
most of the major agencies do meet those standards.
Mr. Towns. Isn't it basically the same ones each time?
Mr. Allen. That is my understanding, yes.
Mr. Towns. Will any of the recommendations made here today
help these agencies create more reliable financial statements?
Mr. Allen. No. The issue is once you provide the
information that is asked for, these recommendations will help
discuss how it ought to be more effectively communicated, how
it can be more effectively accessed. I can tell you, for
example, that one of those, as you well know, is the Department
of Defense accounting for their assets. We have issued
additional standards beyond that says to that and say, well, if
you don't have the information, make estimations, then; do
something to try and move forward.
So we recognize that there is value in information. We
don't want people to spend tons of time researching all costs,
so we are trying to be cost-effective, but that agency still
has to arrive at some point in time of having the information,
and then you can talk about how better to communicate it.
Mr. Towns. Right.
Mr. Breul, if an agency publishes unreliable financial
statements on a central Web site, that can lead to all kinds of
confusion. So what can we do to avoid that kind of situation?
The point is that once that gets out there, and if it is not
correct, that can create some serious problems.
Mr. Breul. Well, I am not sure the information is
unreliable. It hasn't passed the audit standards, but I think
it is just as important to have that disclosure, what we do
know about that situation. It might add a little shame and
humiliation to the situation so that might get people's
attention to insist that they do adhere to the standards.
So, again, I think the idea of a little disclosure is
helpful by making it known that is the condition, and it is a
condition that doesn't satisfy the auditors yet, and that ought
to upset the public and give some an opportunity to insist that
the matter be corrected.
Mr. Towns. In closing, is there anything on this side that
we need to do as Members of Congress to make this work, these
10 recommendations? Anything we need to do?
Mr. Hettinger. I mean, I think, obviously, drawing
attention to the issue, as we are doing today, is an important
first step. I mean, the recommendations, I think, speak for
themselves, but there are a lot of recommendations in there.
These are recommendations that we have made to FASAB. There is
absolutely no reason that, as you look at legislation, as you
conduct your oversight, that you--I mean, you should look at
these recommendations, and some of them may be things that you
all could incorporate into a legislative proposal. Some may
not, and some would have to be tweaked to be incorporated into
a legislative proposal.
But certainly the transparency, the things that call for
the centralized Web site and the Web-based reporting, those are
all things, quite honestly, that Congress could do through
legislation. USASpending, all of those things have been
legislated, so certainly you could do that. Beyond that, you
certainly want to take a look at them, and there may be partial
solutions to some issues, full solutions to others, but I think
you want to take a look at that. And certainly those of us who
were on the task force and others who have been involved in
this process would be happy to help.
Mr. Towns. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Platts. Mr. Connolly.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. By the way, I would
ask unanimous consent to enter my statement into the record.
Mr. Platts. Without objection.
Mr. Connolly. I thank the Chair. I said I had two
questions, so now I go to my second one.
We hear a lot about what more transparent and accurate
accounting could do for the Federal Government. I wonder what
your thoughts are about the critique that is sometimes raised,
but what we don't do very well, and you alluded to it, Mr.
Breul, or maybe you, Mr. Allen, with respect to the Pentagon,
accounting for assets.
But in the public sector we are not always good at
differentiating between consumption spending and investment,
which we do do in the private sector. And we are not always
good at accounting for what is an asset. Especially in the
public sector; it is a little squishier sometimes than it is in
the private sector, for good reasons.
But, in any event, I would like your views on that. How do
we get our arms around assets and spending that constitutes
investments versus some other kinds of spending?
One of the concerns I have, and we have the continuing
resolution on the floor of the House right now, is almost a
mindless approach to spending: it is all bad and it is all the
same. Well, it isn't. The spending on the interstate highway
system, which was initiated by a Republican president, had a
return on it that is impossible to calculate it was so great,
and aren't we glad we made that spending decision? Yes, it cost
money, but it is different than purchasing a bottle of water
and consuming it.
I wonder what your thoughts are on those two issues and how
we can better account for them and how they would perhaps
perfect that picture.
Mr. Breul. Well, Mr. Connolly, I think your point is
exactly the one that is addressed by this new GPRA
Modernization Act, which is recognizing the need to marry the
information about cost with information about what the results
or performance is that you are buying them for. Is it just
water you are consuming or is it a long-term investment that is
going to accrue benefits over time? And having that kind of
performance information visible alongside the cost so you can
make a judgment as to whether that dollar is more or better
spent here rather than there.
And that is why one of the recommendations of this task
force to inform those kind of decisions was to have performance
information highlighted in the consolidated report as well, so
that citizens would have some more information about what they
are getting for those dollars that are being spent.
Mr. Hettinger. I will just add real quick the property plan
equipment, the asset issue is one that I am sure, as the
committee conducts its oversight and you begin to look at
individual agency financial statements, you are going to see a
recurring theme, and part of that recurring theme is going to
be it is very difficult, as part of the financial statement
process, to properly account for assets.
And in particular you are going to see that problem, I
think, as it relates to places where they have huge assets like
the Department of Defense, where you have aircraft carriers and
ships, or NASA, where you have satellites and things like that.
Those are assets, from my experience--and I am not an auditor,
but I did work on the committee for 4 years--those are the
things that as we looked at financial statements when I was on
the committee, repeatedly we heard concerns about.
So to back to Mr. Towns' question, as you are looking at
these things and looking at agency financial statements, one of
the things you probably ought to take a look at is is there a
way to better account for assets for property, plant, and
equipment in a way that it is not property, plant, and
equipment that is drawing down the entire financial statement
but something that can be dealt with and allows those agencies
to effectively manage their finances without having that pull
it down.
Mr. Allen. And I would just add that property, plant, and
equipment is not the most important thing to account for in the
Federal Government absolutely. I think, from my personal
opinion, and everything I say obviously is my opinion, not
FASAB's opinion, but from my personal opinion, the most
important thing is to decide what are you going to do.
Should we expense all of these things when we buy them?
Should we capitalize? And it almost doesn't matter. What
matters is that you apply something. You make a decision, you
apply it consistently going forward from that point. Then you
can measure its impact on the rest of the operations of the
Federal Government.
Is this truly something that has long-term benefits that we
want to capitalize and use up over the long-term? If it isn't
really significant because the Federal Government is sure
significant, maybe we would be better off just expensing it in
the year that we make that expenditure.
Mr. Connolly. And, Mr. Chairman, I know my time is up, but
I do think this is a very important aspect of what we are
talking about, and I hope some day we can expand on it. I can
just tell you my own local government, when I first got
elected, there was no ROI analysis on certain investments.
So it was the clipboard method. Someone went around and
said, OK, Jonathan, what do you think you need this year for
technology? Well, I think I need six computers and maybe I
should have eight, just because government being government,
who knows when I will get replacements. And there was no
question of, well, but wait a minute, let's match your request
against Mike's because he actually can show ROI and we know he
is productive, and you need to compete with him. For us to make
that investment, you are going to have to justify it. At the
time, a completely alien concept.
Today I am proud to say we do it very rigorously and
everybody understands they are going to have to justify that
and other kinds of investments, and that they are in
competition with other agencies. And I am just wondering--I
mean, we haven't got time to do it, but it is my fervent hope
that we can have a similar appreciation in the Federal
Government so that we are actually looking at return on
investment when we make investments.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Platts. I want to thank our witnesses again, both for
your expertise that you shared and your knowledge, but also
your patience here with hearing, because the floor votes didn't
start for about almost an hour and a half late. And we look
forward to continuing, as a committee, working with each of you
individually and collectively as we go forward, and helping to
set the stage today for our March 9th hearing when we do shed
some light on the consolidated financial report.
And as Mr. Cooper said, there may not have been a press
conference held when it was released, but we are going to do
our best to make sure the American people know what it says and
how important it is for them to know what it says because it is
about their money.
With that, we are going to keep the record open for 2 weeks
if there is any additional information to be shared, along with
written statements from Members.
Again, thanks, and this hearing stands adjourned. Thank
you.
[Whereupon, at 4:14 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
