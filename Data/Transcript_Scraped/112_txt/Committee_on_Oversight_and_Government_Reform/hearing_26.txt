WEDNESDAY, MARCH 30, 2011

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Technology, Information Policy,
Intergovernmental Relations and Procurement Reform,
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:13 p.m., in
room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. James Lankford
(chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Present: Representatives Lankford, Kelly, Chaffetz,
Walberg, Labrador, Farenthold, and Connolly.
Staff present: Ali Ahmad, deputy press secretary; Molly
Boyl, parliamentarian; Sharon Casey, senior assistant clerk;
Katelyn E. Christ, research analyst; Linda Good, chief clerk;
Hudson T. Hollister, counsel; Ryan Little, manager of floor
operations; Justin LoFranco, press assistant; Mark D. Marin,
senior professional staff member; Kristina M. Moore, senior
counsel; Kristin L. Nelson, professional staff member; Brian
Quinn and Donald Sherman, minority counsels; and Cecilia
Thomas, minority counsel/deputy clerk.
Mr. Lankford. The committee will come to order.
The opening statements for myself and our ranking member,
Mr. Connolly, I am going to have submitted for the record in
writing so we can go ahead and just move on as quickly as we
can. I do have one letter that I am also asking for unanimous
consent to be able to submit it for the record, a letter to
Doug Elmendorf. With no other reason to deny that, I would
assume that we can receive that by unanimous consent on that.
[The prepared statement of Hon. James Lankford follows:]

Mr. Lankford. Basic ground rules of the hearing: each of
you has been asked to submit a written statement for the
record. We have also asked you to prepare an oral opening
statement no longer than 5 minutes so we can allow time for
questions and discussion after your statement.
You will see on your desk a series of lights and a clock
which will count down from 5 minutes. I know you all have been
briefed on this already. After the entire panel has given their
oral statements, we will have a few questions for you. We will
do those questions in 4-minute increments and get a chance to
clip through that as well. We will be strictly enforcing the
time today. Obviously, we have a very tight schedule; it has
been interrupted by votes. So we are grateful that you are here
and that you have taken a significant amount of time to prepare
your testimony.
Do you have any questions about going through the oral
portion of this?
[No response.]
Mr. Lankford. Thank you. I would like to now read the
mission statement of our committee, and then we will swear you
in.
As the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, we exist
to secure two fundamental principles: first, Americans have a
right to know that the money Washington takes from them is well
spent and, second, Americans deserve an efficient, effective
government that works for them. Our duty on the Oversight and
Government Reform Committee is to protect these rights. It is
our solemn responsibility to hold government accountable to
taxpayers because taxpayers do have the right to know what they
get from their government. We will work tirelessly in
partnership with citizen watchdogs to deliver the facts to the
American people and bring genuine reform to the Federal
bureaucracy. This is the mission of the Oversight and
Government Reform Committee.
We have three witnesses that we are receiving testimony
from today. The Honorable Joni Cutler is a member of the South
Dakota State Senate, representing the 14th District of South
Dakota, serves on the Executive Committee of the National
Conference of State Legislatures. Prior to her service in the
State Senate, Senator Cutler served in the South Dakota State
House of Representatives for 8 years. Thanks for being here.
Mr. Raymond Keating is the chief economist at the Small
Business & Entrepreneur Council and serves as an adjunct
professor in the Business School at Downing College.
And Mr. John Arensmeyer is the founder and CEO of the Small
Business Majority. Prior to that he was the chief operating
officer of a multimedia business and an attorney in New York.
Thank you all for being here. It is our typical practice
here that we swear in guests when they come, so if you would
please rise and raise your right hands.
[Witnesses sworn.]
Mr. Lankford. Thank you very much. Let the record reflect
that all witnesses answered in the affirmative.
Please be seated.
I would like to receive the testimony first from Joni
Cutler. Please, you have 5 minutes. Thank you.

J. KEATING, CHIEF ECONOMIST, SMALL BUSINESS & ENTREPRENEURSHIP
COUNCIL; AND JOHN C. ARENSMEYER, FOUNDER & CEO, SMALL BUSINESS
MAJORITY

STATEMENT OF JONI CUTLER

Ms. Cutler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon,
Chairman Lankford, Ranking Member Connolly, and distinguished
members of the Subcommittee on Technology, Information Policy,
Intergovernmental Relations and Procurement Reform. I am
Senator Joni Cutler, a member of the South Dakota Senate. I am
also a member of the Executive Committee of the National
Conference of State Legislatures, on whose behalf I am
testifying.
NCSL is a bipartisan organization representing the 50 State
legislatures and the legislatures of our Nation's commonwealth,
territories, and District of Columbia. I am very appreciative
of this opportunity to testify on the States' experience with
unfunded and underfunded Federal mandates.
This hearing is particularly timely for three reasons:
First, legislative, regulatory and fiscal burdens the Federal
Government imposes on State and local governments are often
overlooked and frequently underappreciated; second, we have
just celebrated the 16th anniversary of the enactment of the
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and have learned much about its
effectiveness and drawbacks that I will share with you today;
third, Congress and the administration are embarking on an
effort to rein in annual deficits and manage the national debt,
and that effort will unavoidably put on the table State-Federal
partnerships, intergovernmental relationships, and basic issues
regarding fiscal federalism.
In 1995, NCSL and our fellow State and local organizations
hailed bipartisan passage and enactment of UMRA. That law
enhanced the visibility of potential unfunded Federal mandates
and cost shifts, and in some instances changed the nature of
the discussions leading to passage of Federal legislation. It
has led to the development of an able division within the
Congressional Budget Office that produces vital
intergovernmental mandate analysis and an annual report on
UMRA. UMRA's procedural hammer, or more so the threat of using
this hammer, has seemingly acted to douse some efforts to
impose unfunded mandates and shift costs to States and
localities.
A reading of any annual CBO report on UMRA shows how few
mandated actions exceed the law's threshold. However, UMRA's
limitations make it a candidate for improvement and
strengthening, and legislation accomplishing such originating
in this subcommittee would be very helpful. UMRA's limits will
not serve the essential conversation needed to address reduced
future Federal funding or discretionary mandatory programs. Its
limits and loopholes, much the result of negotiations that took
place 16 years ago, omit many mandates in the eyes of State
legislators and other State and local elected officials. These
omissions include new conditions of grants in aid, reduction of
Federal funds without commensurate reduction in program or
administrative requirements, sanctions for failure to comply
with unfunded mandates, and creation of underfunded national
expectations.
Therefore, NCSL is urging a three-pronged approach to
improve UMRA, broaden cooperation and discussion on State and
Federal programs. First, NCSL's policy supports legislation
that would correct UMRA's limitations. For example, H.R. 2255
from the 111th Congress serves as an excellent example of
bipartisan-sponsored legislation that would enjoy support from
me and my fellow lawmakers if offered again in the 112th
Congress.
Such legislation needs to include open-ended entitlements
in any mandatory or entitlement program with capped Federal
funding participation in the definition of an unfunded mandate.
It should also eliminate program exclusions in the underlying
current statute and include new conditions imposed through
older programs under the definition of a mandate. It must also
include conditions of grants in aid. And among several points
made in my written testimony, a revised UMRA law should require
Federal reimbursement to State and local governments for costs
imposed on them by any new Federal mandates for as long as the
mandate exists.
Second, the House and Senate budget resolutions for fiscal
year 2012 should contain general instructions to appropriators
and committees of jurisdiction to avoid creating or expanding
existing unfunded or underfunded mandates. I urge this
subcommittee's membership to prod your leadership and budget
committee chairs to include this instruction in the fiscal year
2012 and subsequent year budget resolutions.
Third, finally, there are several pending reauthorizations
before the 112th Congress. For the most part, committees other
than Oversight and Government Reform have jurisdiction over
them; however, any effort to reauthorize an existing program,
such as No Child Left Behind, the Temporary Assistance for
Needy Families Block Grant, and the SAFETEA-LU transportation
program should be seen as an opportunity for this subcommittee
to explore, repeal, or minimize the provisions that shift costs
to States. They should also be seen as opportunities to provide
program and administrative savings for all levels of government
simultaneously, while maintaining essential public services.
Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Connolly, NCSL offers to
work together with you to address what are hopefully mutual
concerns regarding these authorizations. Mr. Chairman, thank
you for inviting me and the National Conference of State
Legislatures to testify before you today. I look forward to
responding to questions subcommittee members may have.

STATEMENT OF RAYMOND J. KEATING

Mr. Keating. Chairman Lankford, Ranking Member Connolly,
and members of the committee, the Small Business and
Entrepreneurship Council is pleased to provide testimony today
regarding the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and how it relates
to small business and the economy. My name is Raymond Keating.
I am chief economist with SBE Council, a nonpartisan, nonprofit
advocacy, research, and training organization dedicated to
protecting small business and promoting entrepreneurship. SBE
Council works with leaders at local, State, Federal, and
international levels to improve the environment for
entrepreneurship and enhance competitiveness.
Unfortunately, government too often erects obstacles to
improving the climate for entrepreneurship and to enhancing the
competitiveness of U.S. business, including regulations and
mandates that raise costs, diminish incentives and resources
for risk-taking, reduce opportunities and/or create
uncertainty.
I am also an adjunct professor at the Business School at
Dowling Collect in New York. In the MBA Program I frequently
teach public sector economics, in which I emphasize the
importance of understanding the incentives at work not just in
the private sector, but in the public sector as well. And, in
fact, powerful incentives exist within the governmental and
political spheres when it comes to imposing mandates, given the
ability to take governmental actions while others deal with the
cost.
It is also critical to understand that the costs of
regulations and mandates fall much harder on small businesses.
Small businesses often lack adequate resources both in terms of
dollars and staff to deal with the additional costs that come
with governmental mandates.
For good measure, the taxes needed to fund
intergovernmental mandates come from small businesses and their
customers.
Given the powerful incentives at work and often substantial
costs, it is important to have some kind of institutional
checks and balances in the system when it comes to unfunded
mandates.
UMRA, which SBE Council supported, is one of those
counterbalancing measures. It has been beneficial by providing
additional information about the direct costs of unfunded
Federal mandates, injecting the issue of costs further into the
debate, and discussion is a positive development from the small
business perspective. However, problems do exist or, more
accurately, shortcomings. I will name three very quickly.
First, new regulations being proposed under the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act have the
potential to restrict access to and raise the cost of capital
and credit for small business owners; proposed Federal Reserve
rules regarding interchange fees, for example, could make a
currently challenging problem much worse for small businesses.
Yet, the independent regulatory agencies that will be issuing
these rules and are issuing these rules are exempt from UMRA.
Second, the FCC voted in December to impose net neutrality
regulations on Internet broadband providers. The FCC inserting
itself into pricing and operational decisions would have
consequences for investment and innovation in broadband, with
small businesses likely experiencing negative consequences as
consumers, content providers, and app entrepreneurs, for
example. But the FCC is another independent agency not covered
by UMRA.
Third, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
included unfunded mandate burdens far exceeding the thresholds
in UMRA. Those costs affect, either directly or indirectly,
small businesses. Unfortunately, recognition that this massive
health care measure did exceed the threshold levels of UMRA
meant little in terms of legislative reality, which raises some
question about UMRA's ultimate impact.
I would like to just quickly note six problems and
limitations that require some remedies. First, among the most
glaring and troubling is that the law does not cover a large
swath of Federal mandates, including rules issued by
independent regulatory agencies. No. 2, shortcomings with
UMRA's point of order provisions need to be remedied by having
both informational and substantive points of order apply to
legislative and agency mandates on both government and the
private sector.
Third, problems regarding costs must be remedied. Indirect
costs impacting such areas as prices, risk-taking, economic
growth and employment need to be considered. Fourth, when it
comes to agency mandates, an independent entity such as the
GAO, a separate entity within OMB, or an independent office
should have responsibility for evaluating the cost of such
mandates. Fifth, the judicial review included in UMRA lacks
teeth, to say the least, and offers no real incentives to
challenge agencies or for agencies to deal more legitimately
with UMRA requirements.
Sixth, UMRA needs to be built upon or amended to establish
means for evaluating the effectiveness, the actual cost, and
the emergence of unintended consequences of existing
regulations and mandates. Requiring sunsetting and periodic
evaluation of existing regulations and mandates makes sense
given the realities of a dynamic economy. Along with this, a
required congressional vote on all rules, mandates and
regulations being proposed would enhance accountability.
SBE Council appreciates the opportunity to provide input to
the committee, and I look forward to your questions.

Mr. Lankford. Thank you very much.
I now recognize Mr. Arensmeyer. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF JOHN C. ARENSMEYER

Mr. Arensmeyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon,
Chairman Lankford, Ranking Member Connolly, and members of the
committee. Small Business Majority is a nonpartisan small
business advocacy organization founded and run by small
business owners. We represent the 28 million Americans who are
self-employed or own businesses of up to 100 employees. Our
organization uses scientific opinion and economic research to
understand and represent the interests of all small businesses.
I ran two small businesses for 15 years and have run a
nonprofit organization for the past 5. Other members of our
senior team have long careers as entrepreneurs. As such, we are
well aware there are times when small businesses are
overburdened by government regulation and that regulation often
affects small businesses more than big businesses. This is why
we support President Obama's initiative to review government
regulation on business and we support the Small Business
Administration's role in monitoring compliance of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act. We share the view that any
regulations that impact small businesses should be carefully
scrutinized and we support the requirements already in the
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act that require government to analyze
and report on the impacts of new regulations.
That said, there is a legitimate role for government in
passing laws that address private sector business activity.
Business owners are pragmatic, bottom line-oriented, and
preventing or delaying all regulation that might in some way
affect small business would be shortsighted and could actually
remove an important tool that can stimulate small business
innovation and contain costs. Indeed, our research has shown
that small business supports government as a facilitator and an
arbiter that sets rules of the road.
The effects of legislation on the private sector should be
carefully considered as each bill is being debated, not by a
blanket one-size-fits-all approach. The first items on Small
Business's list of concerns are the need for customers and
finding ways to deal with burdensome expenses. In many cases
government can help. I am going to focus on two successful
examples of this, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act and the Clean Air Act.
The No. 1 problem we hear from small businesses about is
the cost of health care. Small businesses want to offer health
coverage, but our scientific bipartisan survey show that 86
percent of them cite cost as the biggest barrier. A major study
that we conducted found that, without reform, small employers
would pay $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years, costing us
178,000 jobs and $52.1 billion in profits. This crisis
compelled Congress to take action. The status quo was just
simply unacceptable.
The Affordable Care Act addresses all these issues and
more. While reducing the Federal deficit by more than $200
billion over the next 10 years and more than $1 trillion over
10 years after that. Our research shows that 4 million small
businesses, that is 84 percent of all businesses, are eligible
for tax credits in the law and that 33 percent of them tell us
in the scientific polling we have done that they are more
likely to cover their employees because of the tax credits and
the marketplaces that are being set up under the law starting
in 2014.
For example, Mark Hodash, owner of Downtown Home and
Garden, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, qualified for a $15,000 tax
credit this year. Knowing he had that credit gave him the
confidence to add another person to his staff. His new
employee, who was unemployed previously, now has a job and is
contributing to the economy by paying taxes and buying goods.
Government support to the clean energy sector of the
economy is also providing much-needed aid to small business.
Indeed, without a strong government role in setting goals and
standards, we will never successfully compete in the
interconnected 21st century global economy that is becoming
more and more centered on innovative clean energy solutions.
Over the last 40 years, the Environmental Protection Agency
has proven itself as much a protector of the economy as of the
public's health. Indeed, during the last two decades under the
Clean Air, gross domestic product has increased 64 percent,
while emissions of the most common air pollutants have declined
by 41 percent. Between 2010 and 2015 alone, capital investments
in pollution control and new generation will generate an
estimated 1.46 million jobs. And the EPA's clean air standards
for automobiles are projected to save owners $3,000 per
vehicle, this amount rising to $7,400 for 2017 to 2022 model
vehicles. This will have a substantial benefit for small
business owners, especially for those businesses who rely on
transportation.
Our bipartisan polling shows that 61 percent of small
businesses agree that moving the country to clean energy is a
way to restart the economy and make their businesses more
competitive. A majority supports an active role for government
in this process. For example, the Clean Air Act and Regulating
Greenhouse Gases helps Cody Metcalf, President of LED light
distributor WinderLumen LED in Windermere, Florida. Cody says
if someone is paying attention to greenhouse gases, then there
is more demand for our product.
As these examples show, a constructive partnership between
business and government can provide economic opportunity and
can help entrepreneurs cut some of the unnecessary and onerous
costs of doing business. Wielding a legislative hammer, rather
than employing a judicious and precise scalpel risks squashing
a role for government that is often a boon to small business.
Thank you.

Mr. Lankford. Thank you very much.
Based on our prior agreement that I had with the ranking
member, I am going to recognize myself for 4 minutes, and we
will do 4 minute questioning time on that.
Senator Cutler, thank you for being here. Thank all of you
for being here, in fact, and for your testimony, both written
and oral. I would like to also add that if anyone else wants to
be able to submit a statement, that they can certainly do that
in writing and we will receive those for the next 7 days.
Senator Cutler, you talk about statutory caps, for
instance, and talk about when caps are added, you would like to
have some basic statutory relief that would offset that; that
it may be a situation where you are not looking for additional
funds, but looking for additional offsets. Can you elaborate
more on that, what you mean?
Ms. Cutler. Well, I think, really, if I could make one
point and have one takeaway point for you today, it would be
that in all of this what we are really looking for is the
difference between theory and effect, really, the idea that
whatever is in the statute should clearly reflect the effect
that it is going to have on the States, as we struggle so hard
right now in these times to balance our budgets. So any time we
have a cap, then we look toward what is it the States would
have to do to remedy that cap, and we should be able to clearly
identify through the process what it is that is going to take
place at a State-by-State level; and that would be so very
helpful to us in planning our budgets.
Mr. Lankford. You also made a statement about changing the
term direct cost or expenditure to a reasonably foreseeable
direct cost or indirect cost. Can you elaborate a little bit
more on that as well?
Ms. Cutler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Those indirect costs
really are described now under the definition as an indirect
cost, but in reality they still have to come up and take their
place in our budgets. So by including things that are presently
exempted, by identifying the cost shifts that any piece of
legislation may have on shifting the burden of costs to the
States that they presently don't have, and then adding to the
definition those changes that are made in the programs that
presently exist, we will help the States go a long way in
really planning for taking care and coming into compliance with
the requirements of the Federal legislation that you pass.
Mr. Lankford. OK, thank you.
Mr. Keating, you made some very specific recommendations.
In one of them you were talking about independent agencies that
are exempted from UMRA. Any specific examples that you can
note? I know you have a lot in your opening statement about
dealing with independent agency. You mention SEC at one point,
but other examples you can give us on that?
Mr. Keating. Well, I mentioned the FCC in terms of what
they are doing in terms of net neutrality regulation; I talked
about the new consumer protection agency that is being
developed. These are all going to have clear impacts on the
small business community, what they are putting forward. Net
neutrality regulation, it is not just the big broadband
providers. When you look at all the costs, again, getting to
all the costs in the equation, it is going to be felt
throughout the economy and small business and entrepreneurs as
well.
Mr. Lankford. Do you see any reason why Congress, when they
are making a decision about a particular piece of legislation,
should not be informed even if it affects some independent
agency, why the lack of information is somehow beneficial?
Mr. Keating. No, I don't understand that. Quite frankly, I
would say that there shouldn't be any exclusions here across
the board because we are talking about information here, and,
in my view, more information is better. The more information
you have, the better decisions you can make. So no matter what
we are talking about, whether it is independent regulatory
agency or legislation, or all those other areas, quite frankly,
that are excluded, I don't understand why they should be, why
they are excluded. We should have more information so we can
make better, intelligent decisions.
Mr. Lankford. That would be my perception as well.
Mr. Arensmeyer, you mentioned several things that became
regulatory benefits to smaller business, but in your opening
statement you made several statements about there are some
burdensome things that government does to small businesses, but
you didn't mention any in particular. Are there any particular
areas that you look at and say this does become burdensome for
us?
Mr. Arensmeyer. Well, there is always the potential, any
time you are passing legislation, and we certainly endorse that
Congress needs to have all the information about potential
burdens. I mean, obviously, one thing that comes to mind now is
that the 1089 provision that is in the health care law, it
should not have been there; it is a burden with not very much
benefit coming the other way, and we certainly wish that would
go away as quickly as possible.
Mr. Lankford. OK. We are working on that.
Now I would like to recognize the ranking member, Mr.
Connolly, for 4 minutes of questioning.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Keating, when Congress passed the Clean Air Act
amendments of 1990, a lot of small businesses and industries
claimed that the cost of electricity would skyrocket, putting
extreme financial pressure on individuals and small businesses'
electric bills. In fact, did that materialize?
Mr. Keating. I would have to take a look at exactly the
provisions you are talking about and what the results of it
were, so I can't----
Mr. Connolly. Well, is it your impression that between 1990
and now electric bills have skyrocketed, putting an undue
financial burden on small businesses?
Mr. Keating. I live in New York, so yes, I would have to
answer yes to that. But I would have to take a look at
specifically those provisions and see what the results were,
because you have to obviously factor in a whole host of other
measures that would come into play in terms of impacting the
cost.
Mr. Connolly. Mr. Arensmeyer, is that your impression?
Mr. Arensmeyer. Our impression is that the opportunities
that have been created by the environmental regulations of the
EPA have spurred tremendous boon to new industries in this
country, new industries that are likely to be able to more
adequately compete around the world. And all the studies that
have been done about increased costs have shown that they have
been small or little, and they are completely offset by
improvements in energy efficiency that are driven by the desire
to move toward a more energy-efficient economy.
Mr. Connolly. I mention it because we heard many of the
same arguments 20 years ago on Clean Air Act amendments, in
terms of their impact on small businesses, almost none of
which, dire predictions, that is, came true. As a matter of
fact, quite the opposite.
You brought up health care and the assertion that health
care imposes onerous regulations on small businesses, requiring
them to offer health insurance. Do you know what percentage of
small businesses fall under the 50 employee threshold?
Mr. Arensmeyer. About 4 percent of businesses in this
country have over 50 employees, and of those 4 percent, 96
percent of those already offer insurance.
Mr. Connolly. So let me get this straight, Mr. Arensmeyer.
Therefore, 96 percent of all small businesses are exempt from
these so-called onerous regulations in requiring health care
coverage for their employees.
Mr. Arensmeyer. Correct.
Mr. Connolly. And of the remaining 4 percent of small
businesses in America, 96 percent already offer health care
insurance.
Mr. Arensmeyer. Correct.
Mr. Connolly. And therefore would also be exempt from this
onerous regulation since they already provide.
Mr. Arensmeyer. Yes.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you.
The EPA issued a tailoring rule that limits greenhouse gas
pollution regulations to sources that emit more than 75,000
tons of carbon dioxide annually. Is there a single small
business that would have a pollution source exceeding this
extremely high threshold, Mr. Keating?
Mr. Keating. I would have to again take a look at the
details of that, but of course small businesses are going to be
affected if costs rise for utility firms and manufacturing. So
even if you see higher costs on larger firms and on utilities,
that obviously is going to affect small businesses.
Mr. Connolly. Mr. Arensmeyer.
Mr. Arensmeyer. My understanding is that limits on the
traditional emissions, sulfur dioxide, things like that, and
those completely exempted. There is no possible way any small
business would fall under those. And with the greenhouse gas
rules, they have raised that substantially so it kind of
matches up with the size of the facilities that would be
covered by the traditional pollutants.
So basically even under the greenhouse gas rules there is
no way any small business would be directly impacted by that.
And the indirect impacts, we have seen figures like half of a
cent, which is on a unit basis. And when you start to look at
the energy efficiency across the whole economy, the costs are
going to come down dramatically as we sort of move in that
direction.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you.
Senator Cutler, real quickly. I also came from local
government, spent 14 years in local government. Do you see a
difference between unfunded mandates with respect to State and
local government, and the regulation of private industry? Are
those two different things?
Ms. Cutler. Thank you for the question. I think oftentimes
there is an overlap. You can't often move one piece without a
resulting effect on the other piece. So I don't know if I am
getting to the heart of your question or not, but we certainly
hear from our local governments often in the legislature
regarding all of the things that we do and the impact that they
have, and I think that is part of why we are here today, is to
say we really need to make sure that all of the work that we
do, that people clearly understand the impact on their business
and on State government and on local government.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you.
My time is up, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Lankford. Thank you.
I recognize Mr. Farenthold for 4 minutes.
Mr. Farenthold. Thank you very much.
I think I want to start off with Mr. Keating. You have
heard Mr. Arensmeyer's testimony indicating that the Affordable
Care Act and Clean Air Act have actually created more jobs.
That goes very much against what I hear from the folks back
home in South Texas, that the burdens the Affordable Care Act
would place and that certainly the EPA's overzealous
enforcement of the Clean Air Act and expansion of it in Texas,
taking that over from the Texas State government is adversely
affecting business. Would your members agree with Mr.
Arensmeyer statement?
Mr. Keating. No. We have some 100,000 members, and you can
pick and choose your studies, but if you want to look at the
greenhouse gas regulations, the overwhelming work that has been
done on this shows that costs are going to skyrocket in terms
of the costs of carbon-based energy. There is no way you can
reduce emissions or cap emissions without, in effect, raising
the costs of carbon-based energy; that is the reality of it.
And when you look at how that spreads throughout the economy,
it is going to be devastating, I would argue a devastating
impact on small businesses, on our competitiveness.
And in terms of the Health Care Reform Act, again, our
members would strongly disagree. You can go down the line, the
pay or play mandate, the individual mandate, the dictates on
what exactly is the government going to mandate through these
exchanges that we have. We keep hearing that we are going to
have more competition in choice. I think it is more of a
vehicle for mandates and regulations. So all the way down the
board I think these issues are major cost worries and they
certainly create a tremendous amount of uncertainty for small
business.
Mr. Farenthold. Thank you very much.
Senator Cutler, I was wondering if, in your State, it was
similar to what we experience in Texas, that the delay
associated with complying with specific Federal regulations,
and getting things like highway projects or building projects
permitted through the various agencies really seems to take an
excessive amount of time. The numbers I hear are between 3 and
7 years, and drive the costs up significantly. Are you seeing
that in your State as well?
Ms. Cutler. Yes. In fact, one example I would like to give
you is one that we don't often think of, and that is the Adam
Walsh Sex Offender Registry Notification Act. I have been
involved in several attempts to find out, through the
rulemaking process in the Department of Justice, just what the
responsibilities for coming into compliance would be. And even
through two administrations and 5 years of extensions to come
into compliance, I believe there are still, at this point, only
four States that have been able to come into compliance; and it
is not because they aren't trying. And States have a lot to
lose. Their Byrne grant funds hinge on coming into compliance
with Adam Walsh and SORNA, so it is an example of the very
thing you are talking about.
Mr. Farenthold. All right, I have less than a minute left,
but I want to just do a quick question to each of the members
of the panel. There are some proposals being bantered around in
this Congress for perhaps a 24-month moratorium on new Federal
regulations, just to give businesses time to catch up, catch
their breath and get going. What would each of you feel about
that?
Ms. Cutler. Well, I think 24 months, if that is all it is,
doesn't go far enough to help us; and I don't mean in terms of
the time, I mean in terms of the consultation and the dialog
that needs to go on and the impact of regulations and the input
from the States in making those rules and regulations.
Mr. Farenthold. Mr. Keating.
Mr. Keating. Any kind of break that we can get from
regulations would be much appreciated, I think, from the
business community, yes.
Mr. Arensmeyer. I guess we would feel that one-size-fits-
all is not the way to go, that we strongly endorse that every
piece of legislation be looked at carefully and analyzed. But
because so much of what government does is in partnership with
business, and I have cited two examples, pretty large examples,
brings benefit, that I think this needs to be looked at on a
case-by-case basis.
Mr. Farenthold. Well, I am out of time. Thank you all very
much.
Mr. Lankford. Thank you. This is a very important issue for
us and I know that we have been rushing to get through all
this. Both your oral and your written statements are vital and
will obviously be kept in the record, so we will get a chance
to refer back to them in the days to come. This is our second
hearing. It is very important that both of you are here. We
heard from county governments and city governments last time as
well as oversight. Obviously, UMRA affects State governments
and affects the private sector as well, specifically noted into
that law, so it is important to be able to get your
perspective, and I thank you very much for your time.
With that, other Members may submit something.
Mr. Connolly. Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Lankford. Yes, sir.
Mr. Connolly. Could I just note for the record that
obviously, at least on this side of the aisle, we make a
profound distinction between the issue of unfunded mandates on
State and local governments and the issue of regulation on
business? They are two separate animals, they are not related,
and we believe that if we are going to have hearings on
unfunded mandates, they should stick to the former, not the
latter.
Mr. Lankford. I do. I understand that very well, and we
have discussed that as well, but obviously UMRA references both
of them, so we want to have a chance to have hearings based on
both of them together. So I appreciate very much your time.
With that, this hearing is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 2:46 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
