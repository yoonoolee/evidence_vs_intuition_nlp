REGULATORY BARRIERS TO AMERICAN INDIAN JOB CREATION

----------

THURSDAY, APRIL 7, 2011

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Technology, Information Policy,
Intergovernmental Relations and Procurement Reform,
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 1:40 p.m., in
room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. James Lankford
(chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Present: Representatives Connolly, Lankford, and Labrador.
Also present: Representative Issa.
Staff present: Ali Ahmad, deputy press secretary; Molly
Boyl, parliamentarian; Joseph A. Brazauskas, counsel; Sharon
Casey, senior assistant clerk; Christopher Hixon, deputy chief
counsel, oversight; Justin LoFranco, press assistant; Kristina
M. Moore, senior counsel; Adam Miles, minority professional
staff member; Leah Perry, minority chief investigative counsel;
and Brian Quinn, minority counsel.
Mr. Lankford. The committee will come to order.
We do apologize for running a little bit behind. As you
know well, we have some votes being called; and we are very
confident to have to be able to take a short recess here in a
moment and do some other votes.
Let me do a quick statement here, the oversight committee
mission statement. This is Regulatory Barriers to Indian
American Job Creation. So I want to read this statement
quickly.
We exist to secure two fundamental principals. First,
Americans have a right to know that the money Washington takes
from them is well spent; and, second, Americans deserve an
efficient, effective government that works for them.
Our duty in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee
is to protect these rights. Our solemn responsibility is to
hold government accountable to the taxpayers, because taxpayers
have a right to know what they get from their government. We
will work tirelessly in partnership with citizen watchdogs to
deliver the facts to the American people and bring genuine
reform to the Federal bureaucracy. This is the mission of the
Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
I will make a quick opening statement, just to be able to
set up what we are trying to accomplish today.
The relationship between American Indians and the Federal
Government is a relationship that is entirely unique in
America. For over a century, Federal programs have worked hand
in hand with tribal leaders to encourage economic development
among Native American populations. A principal part of this
hearing is to listen and to learn how and why unemployment
remains high in Native American populations and how the Federal
Government affects economic development among the tribes.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs has promulgated regulations
and established programs that oversee lands, criminal justice,
education, infrastructure specifically pertaining to tribal
groups. Yet tribal groups continue to struggle to grow their
economies, provide jobs for their members, and have access to
fundamental building blocks of a prosperous society.
According to the most recent available data, national
unemployment rates for Indians was as high as 15.2 percent. On
some reservations, unemployment rates reach as high as 50
percent. There is bipartisan agreement on the many failures of
the BIA. Information was retrieved from the GAO and OIG in
addition to tribal interviews on how BIA could better serve
Americans Indians.
The Department of the Interior Office of the Inspector
General has written numerous reports about widespread, systemic
failures of the BIA and the Bureau of Indian Education, Two of
the bureaus within the Department of the Interior responsible
for administering programs designed to provide essential
services to American Indians.
OIG investigators and auditors found disturbingly poor
conditions in Indian schools prepared by the Bureau of Indian
Education. Students attend classes sometimes in condemned
buildings that lack proper electrical and heating systems, no
fire detection systems, no running water. In some cases,
buildings crumble around children as they attend class.
The Office of Inspector General also found that school
violence was rampant, and students and staff were risking their
safety and sometimes their lives attending some of these
schools. These conditions are clearly not conducive to
learning.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs has been accused of
mismanaging taxpayer money by spending of tens of millions of
dollars on failed programs such as bungled conversion of the
narrow band radio technology. A BIA program can hamstring
access to economic development by regulations and a process
that hinders land leasing for natural resources.
Tribes are often at the mercy of the Federal Government's
decisions and have little recourse for injecting their own
opinions for self-determination of these processes. In other
instances, private entities often pass up investment
opportunity on Indian land because of a complicated 49-step
process, which includes NEPA analysis required for development
on Federal trust land.
Investment on tribal land is also impeded by
fractionalization, a process begun almost 150 years ago by the
General Allotment Act of 1887. Land parcels given to tribal
members are owned in fractional portions by thousands of heirs.
Both of these land management practices can present barriers to
the development of resources on Native American lands.
Given these problems, it is disturbing that BIA has a long
history of nonresponsiveness to the Office of Inspector General
and other oversight entities and routinely ignores these
reports and recommendations, while continuing to fall short on
delivering the basic services to 1.9 million American Indians.
This hearing is not designed with predetermined outcomes.
We are listening and looking for input. We look forward to your
testimony today, and we thank you very much for attending and
contributing your time.
As chair, I now recognize the distinguished ranking member,
Mr. Connolly, for his opening statement.
Mr. Connolly. I thank the chairman, and I thank you for
holding these hearings.
Given the fact that we are already voting, I will just
summarize a couple of high points of my testimony.
Without objection, would the full statement be entered into
the record?
Mr. Lankford. Absolutely, without objection.
Mr. Connolly. I thank the Chair.
I think the chair has outlined some of the problems in the
Native American community and especially in management issues
with BIA, from education to waste, fraud, and abuse in the
programs.
On the other hand, I would hope that we would broaden our
consideration to also look at the disinvestment in the Native
American community occurring in this Congress.
If you look at H.R. 1, the continuing resolution that was
passed on a party line vote a month and a half ago, that cut
Native American housing block grants by $200 million. It
reduced Royal Utility Service by 24 percent and eliminated
entirely the Native American youth program. I believe that
those cuts are going to have serious impacts in the Native
American community throughout the United States, and so I will
be interested in hearing testimony about what are those impacts
and what other kinds of things do we need to avoid.
I notice, for example, that an awful lot of Native American
communities strongly urged us, especially western fishing
groups are urging us not to pass H.R. 872 deregulating
pesticides in the Clean Water Act. Yet, of course, we are bound
to do that. That is going happen, unfortunately.
I believe that we also ought to be looking at exploring
opportunities for further collaboration between the Federal
Government and Native American communities. Clearly, the BIA
could do more in promoting tourism. Clearly, the BIA and other
elements of the Federal Government could be collaborating with
a lot of Native American communities on renewable energy
resources, wind power, solar power, and could actually take
advantage of a natural resource we all share, especially in
many of those communities.
So I will be very interested in talking about job creation
and in taking advantage of some resources and opportunities
that exist in the community and where perhaps some of the
decisions already made in this Congress have perhaps
unintentionally but nonetheless had a deleterious affect on the
community.
Thank you so much and thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Lankford. You are very welcome.
Members will have 7 days to submit opening statements, any
other materials for the record; and other witnesses may submit
items for the record to be able to be included within the next
7 days.
We are going to take a short recess, and when we come back
I want to be able to introduce our guests that are here and
swear you in and begin the process for this. We will have other
Members that will join us at that time.
We expect about four votes, which that would mean probably
around 40 minutes or so. So if you need to be able to slip away
and be able to come back, you will have time to be able
accomplish that. And then our staff will be here, and they will
be able keep you up to date what is happening during the voting
process.
Thank you for being here, and we stand in recess.
[Recess.]
Mr. Lankford. The subcommittee will come back into order.
We are going welcome our panel of guests. I am very honored
that you all chose to be able to here today and be able to
share your testimony with us, both oral and written testimony.
Ms. Mary Kendall is now the Acting Inspector General at the
Department of the Interior. Thank you very much for being here.
Ms. Anu Mittal is the Director of the Natural Resources
Environment Team at GAO. Ms. Patricia Douville, council
representative for the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. And Mr. Ron Allen
is the chairman of the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe.
So we really appreciate you all being here.
It is our tradition that we swear in witnesses before we
begin testimony. If you all would please stand and raise your
right hands.
[Witnesses sworn.]
Mr. Lankford. Thank you. Let the record reflect the
witnesses answered in the affirmative. You may be seated.
In order to allow time for discussion, I ask you to be able
to limit your oral testimony to around 5 minutes or the lights
that you will see in front of you there will help count
everything down for you.
Your entire written statement will be made part of the
record, in case you don't get all of your oral testimony in.
I would like to begin with you, Ms. Kendall; and you may
begin your 5 minutes.

STATEMENTS OF MARY L. KENDALL, ACTING INSPECTOR GENERAL,
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR; ANU K. MITTAL, DIRECTOR, NATURAL
RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT TEAM, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY
OFFICE; RODNEY M. BORDEAUX, PRESIDENT, ROSEBUD SIOUX TRIBE,
GIVEN BY PATRICIA DOUVILLE, COUNCIL MEMBER, ROSEBUD SIOUX
TRIBE; AND RON ALLEN, CHAIRMAN, JAMESTOWN S'KLALLAM TRIBE

STATEMENT OF MARY R. KENDALL

Ms. Kendall. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee for the opportunity to testify today about the
challenges associated with economic development on tribal lands
and creation of jobs for American Indians.
Responsibility to American Indians has consistently been a
top management challenge for the Department of the Interior.
The myriad problems we have uncovered in BIA portray programs
that are sorely understaffed and poorly managed. The OIG has
identified gross program inefficiencies at many levels at
Indian Affairs and in tribal land management of Federal funds.
Let me summarize some of the more recent work we have done
regarding the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
The Federal Government has long acknowledged the complexity
of land fractionation on Indian trust operations. Fractionation
is the result of dividing tribal land into parcels and
allotting the parcels to individual Indians. The allotments are
then subsequently divided among heirs through probate. With
each generation, the amount of fractionation increases. We are
working with the Department as it develops a comprehensive plan
that will guide its efforts to significantly reduce
fractionation.
We found that $32 million in roads funds were distributed
by one region annually, but only $3 to $4 million in roads
projects had any physical oversight or verification of work by
BIA.
In another instance, we determined that BIA paid out over
$2.4 million for airport and roads improvement. Of that, we
estimate that $1.6 million had a been expended on a
nonspecified road maintenance project and that as much as
$200,000 may have been overbilled by a subcontractor.
BIA also mismanaged a $9 million DOT funded ferryboat in
Alaska that turned into a private boat tour.
In each of these instances, meaningful management oversight
was, quite simply, absent.
Nearly 7 years ago, the OIG conducted a thorough assessment
of Indian country detention facilities. Our assessment revealed
a long history of neglect and apathy on the part of BIA
officials, which resulted in serious safety, security, and
maintenance deficiencies at the majority of the detention
facilities in Indian country.
We recently completed an evaluation of BIA's efforts to
improve staffing levels at their detention facilities, a
critical issue directly impacting safety and security and a key
recommendation from our 2004 report. We have determined that,
despite the focus of the seriousness of the problem and a 48
percent increase in funding, in excess of $64 million, BIA has
failed to address the staffing shortages and the state of these
facilities remains largely unchanged.
In February 2010, the OIG issued an evaluation of school
violence prevention measures in tribally operated schools.
Overall, our evaluation revealed that many schools are
dangerously unprepared to prevent violence and ensure the
safety of students and staff. That report on school violence
was preceded by a report in August 2008, addressing
preparedness for violence in BIE-operated schools. Our findings
were, not surprisingly, very similar.
In some other management weaknesses, 10 individuals,
including a BIA agency superintendent, have been indicted in
connection with a decade-long fraud scheme to embezzle funds
from a tribal credit program. Seven of the 10 indicted,
including two other BIA employees, have pleaded guilty to
various changes related to the fraud scheme. Total loss to the
credit program is approximately $1.2 million.
For 14 years, BIA funded a nonexistent fish hatchery. BIA
continued to fund the hatchery even after a superintendent
visited the reservation and saw that the hatchery site had been
converted into office space.
Due to our resource limitations, the OIG refers many
serious allegations of employee misconduct such as fraud,
theft, retaliation, and misuse of funds to the BIA on a regular
basis with the expectation that the issues will be
appropriately resolved or that poor managers and other
ethically challenged employees will be held accountable.
Unfortunately, BIA more than any other bureau at Interior, has
a history of failing to respond to the OIG referrals or, even
worse, completely disregarding the serious matters referred to
them.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to share this
information with you. I will be happy to answer any questions
you or other members of the committee may have.

STATEMENT OF ANU K. MITTAL

Ms. Mittal. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee. I
am pleased to be here today to participate in your hearing on
challenges to the economic development in Indian country.
As you know, Indian tribes are among the Nation's most
economically distressed groups and often lack basic
infrastructure. Without such infrastructure, tribes often find
it difficult to compete successfully in the economic
mainstream.
In addition, our past work has identified several unique
circumstances that exist in Indian country that may create
additional uncertainties or impediments for both tribes and
private companies wishing to pursue economic activity in these
areas. I would like to briefly describe five of these unique
circumstances for you.
The first unique circumstance that creates uncertainty
relates to the land-in-trust status for Indian lands. In 1934,
the Indian Reorganization Act provided the Secretary of the
Interior discretionary authority to take land in trust on
behalf of federally recognized tribes or their members. Trust
status helps secure these lands for tribal use, and these lands
are no longer subject to State and local property taxes and
zoning ordinances.
However, a 2009 Supreme Court decision has created
significant uncertainty regarding the land-in-trust status for
a large number of tribes. This is because the Supreme Court
ruled that Interior can only take land in trust for tribes that
were under Federal jurisdiction in 1934. At this time, it is
unclear how many pending land-in-trust applications will be
affected by this decision.
The second circumstance unique to Indian country relates to
tribal environmental standards. The Clean Water Act, Safe
Drinking Water Act, and Clean Air Act authorized the EPA to
treat Indian tribes as States for the purposes of implementing
these laws on tribal lands. As sovereign governments, tribes
want to exercise this authority because they believe they are
more familiar with their own environmental needs. However,
States are concerned that allowing tribes to set these
standards could result in a patchwork of standards within the
State and potentially hinder a State's overall economic
development plans.
Our past work has indeed found that this authority has
resulted in several disagreements between tribes and States. In
addition, more stringent tribal standards could also act as a
disincentive for companies who may choose to not operate their
businesses on tribal lands because of these standards.
The third circumstance relates to the use of special tax
provisions for Indian reservations. One example of such a
special tax provision is allowing tribes to use tax-exempt
bonds to finance essential government functions on
reservations. Use of tax-exempt bonds lowers borrowing costs
for tribes and provides higher after-tax yields to investors.
However, it is unclear to what extent this provision has
actually helped tribes, because the IRS has not yet issued
regulations defining what activities are allowable under this
provision. Without these regulations, tribes have limited
guidance to help them decide what function they can fund with
tax-exempt bonds.
The fourth circumstance relates to the complex process of
obtaining rights of way across Indian lands. Securing rights of
way is an essential step to providing tribes with the critical
infrastructure that they need to support economic activity.
However, obtaining rights of way can be time-consuming and
expensive, in part because Interior must approve these
applications.
Several of the steps that service providers must take to
get Interior's approval involve negotiating with the
landowners, who can be individuals, multiple owners, or tribes.
If an individual allotment of Indian land is owned by multiple
owners, sometimes reaching into the hundreds, then this process
can become even more onerous because Federal regulations
require that the majority of owners must approve a right of way
before it can be finalized.
The final unique circumstance I would like to discuss is
the legal and judicial systems that exist in Indian country.
Having effective legal and judicial systems is often considered
a prerequisite to attracting private investment to tribal
lands. This is because such systems provide investors with
assurance that disputes will be resolved fairly. However, the
legal and judicial systems on tribal lands are fairly complex
and tribes also have sovereign immunity. These circumstances
can act as disincentives for businesses who are trying to
decide whether to operate on tribal or nontribal lands.
As you can see, Mr. Chairman, there are a number of unique
circumstances that tribes and business owners must consider
when making decisions about whether or not to pursue economic
development in Indian country. In some cases, these
circumstances can act as impediments.
This concludes my prepared statement. I'd be happy to
answer any questions.

now.

STATEMENT OF RODNEY M. BORDEAUX GIVEN BY PATRICIA DOUVILLE

Ms. Douville. Thank you.
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and committee members. On
behalf of President Rodney Bordeaux of the Rosebud Sioux tribe
and the Sicangu Lakota Oyate, I would like to thank you for
convening this hearing on regulatory barriers in American
Indian job creation.
The Rosebud Sioux Indian reservation is located in south
central South Dakota. Our reservation consists of 900,000 plus
acres of rolling prairie grasslands, rich for agricultural
production and filled with other natural resources.
Our tribal president, Rodney Bordeaux, has now presided 6
years. The weight of his position bears heavily upon his heart.
He has seen entirely too much poverty and tragedy on a daily
basis among our people. This underlying poverty has caused many
social ills and issues. Now it has become so pronounced that an
air of hopelessness exists on the reservation, especially
within our youth.
According to the 2010 census, the Rosebud reservation lies
in the fourth poorest county in our Nation. With your help, we
intend to change this.
Our natural resources here are many. We intend to use these
resources to the best of abilities, from grazing cattle to
farming leases along with timber production.
In the future, we seek to build our economy from the
renewable energies that our resources provide, from wind
development, hydropower, geothermal, to biomass into fuels.
The Rosebud Sioux tribe has been exploring the potential of
wind power since 1998. In March 2003 we built a 750 kilowatt
Neg Micon turbine capable of providing enough energy--
electricity for 200 homes annually. We call this project the
casino turbine project, because it is located next to our
tribal casino.
This effort was accomplished through the assistance of a
Department of Energy grant and a rural utility service loan
through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. From this initial
project, the Rosebud Sioux tribe accomplished a goal of having
the first commercial sale of wind energy by a tribal government
in the United States, and we are very proud to state that. Our
partners in the accomplishment were Distributed General Inc. of
Lakewood, CA [DISGEN], and the Intertribal Council on Utility
Policy [ICOUP].
After our first project, we continued our partnership with
DISGEN; and with their assistance we have applied for and were
awarded a second DOE grant in 2003 to conduct all the
preconstruction activities to develop a 30 megawatt wind farm
near the town of St. Francis, South Dakota, on tribal trust
lands, called the Owl Feather War Bonnet Wind Farm.
In 2008, 5 long years since the award, a FONSI was issued
by the Bureau of Indian Affairs; and a grant of use and lease
agreement with DISGEN and OFWB LLC was also provided by the BIA
and the tribe. Despite insurmountable hurdles and delayed
action from BIA, we have had a shovel ready wind farm project
since August 2008.
The remaining issue to overcome is the Power Purchase
Agreement, PPA. This issue has severely tested the expertise of
our developer, Dale Osborn of DISGEN, due to the uniqueness of
the project being on tribal trust lands and the distance to
electric loads.
Timing is an important issue in this matter, and the
project needs to be ready when an RPF is posted. If the BIA did
not take 18 months to approve the grant lease agreement, the
project could have been operating and making a sorely needed
revenue stream for the tribe.
We had two draft PPAs in hand, but due to the lack of wind
experience within BIA and the BIA extensive timeframes, the
RFPs for renewable energy from Basin Electric and then Nebraska
Public Power District has expired. DISGEN's efforts to make
this project succeed are undeniable; and they have, in my view,
exhausted all efforts to work with NPPC and Southwest Power
Pool to respond to all RFPs applicable.
Unless we sell directly to NPPD, the project cannot get
built. Selling beyond NPPD, wheeling and tariff fee will drive
the economics beyond the cost to build and repair the project,
plus royalties. It is estimated that we can build this project
at $66 million if the project can ensure a PPA at 4\1/2\ cents
a kilowatt, escalating at 2\1/2\ percent annually with no
wheeling or tariff fees imposed and only if we sell to NPPD.
A power purchase agreement is the only remaining
significant issue that needs to be completed for OFWB. It has
identified three Federal energy buyers that may apply for
``double RECs'' points toward the renewable energy goals of the
Energy Policy Act of 2005: The first one is any Federal agency
through the WAPA system that take can the energy from the St.
Francis substation; the Omaha Public Power District that could
sell the energy and renewable energy certificates to Offutt Air
Force Base; and NPPD that could sell the energy and RECs to the
Federal customers. This project can be constructed by the end
of 2011.
The Federal Government can make this project happen if
trust responsibility is exercised in good faith. We are not
asking for moneys to fund this project. We are asking the
Federal Government to assist us in efforts to secure a PPD,
help us find this path.
We also ask that you live up to the doctrine of trust
responsibility in assisting us to help ourselves in building
our economy. Direct the Department of Energy to assist the
Bureau of Indian Affairs to fine-tune and quicken the process
of all economic development ventures on Federal Indian trust
lands.
The current process is too time-consuming and bureaucratic,
most often killing any project immediately, as most investors
don't want a project to be collecting dust on BIA's shelf. This
will eliminate an overly bureaucratic process to develop
renewable energy. The Rosebud Sioux tribe intends to utilize
the revenue stream from our commercial wind efforts to teach
energy education, energy efficiency, and energy independence.
The use of our natural resources will help our people in the
tribe to build self-sustainable businesses from renewable
energy sources.
The revenue brought forth will adjust our people's drastic
need to upgrade our existing houses into energy efficient homes
with renewable energy devices attached and to lessen our
dependency on the larger electrical grid, along with the
employment and businesses for our people.
Thank you for your time. I wasn't able to read the whole
testimony, because it is quite lengthy, as you can tell. I was
only speaking on one issue, but there are so many more that we
have.

Mr. Lankford. We will have several questions for you, and
we will be honored to have that testimony and put it into the
written record as well.
Ms. Douville. Thank you.
Mr. Lankford. No, thank you very much.
Chairman Allen, I am honored you are here. Pleased to
receive 5 minutes of testimony from you.

STATEMENT OF RON ALLEN

Mr. Allen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Well, you have my testimony, and thank you for accepting it
and putting it in the record.
Again, I am Ron Allen, chairman of Jamestown S'Klallam
tribe located in western Washington State. I am also the
treasurer for the National Congress of American Indians, and I
have served in that organization for about 20 years. I've been
the chairman for 34 years, and so I have been actively involved
in Indian country from east to west, north to south. I probably
have been on more Indian reservations than anybody, except
maybe Senator Dan Inouye.
This topic of regulatory barriers for economic development
and job creation in Indian country is a very broad category. In
our testimony, we share with you the success of my tribe, 565
Indian nations in America. We are from small, like my tribe, to
larger ones, like Rosebud Sioux; and we all have various
different circumstances in which we want to advance our
economic development and our independence.
The independent nature of the Indian communities is a
longstanding historical relationship. The mere fact that there
has become a dependency is not our fault. It is a fault of a
system that is a historical system. So the question of the
regulatory barriers is relative to what is the Federal
Government's obligation and responsibilities via treaties and
statutes and just moral, legal responsibilities to the Indian
communities as governments in our political system. We think it
is deeply rooted and curved back into the Constitution.
But we also feel that we have made great success as the
U.S. Government has made a decision. Termination, assimilation
are policies that don't work. Empowerment of tribal governments
in our communities and our people in order to advance economic
development does work, and you have seen in the last 25 plus
years where it is becoming more and more successful.
You heard in previous testimony different examples and
different areas that need some work. Fraud and abuse issues
that are out there, yes, but relative to how the success is, it
is a small area. So we don't want you to see a few small areas
where we have gone awry and judge how well we are doing
categorically across America.
Success is going exceptionally well in economic
development, but we do have barriers. The GAO made the point of
examples of access to finance. The Tribal Government Tax Status
Act passed in 1984 created the authority of us to issue tax
exempt bonds, to seek revenues in order to advance economic
development in our communities. But it does not treat us the
same as other governments. Well, that is not right. If you have
cities coming in and they are telling you we are not treated
the same way as the States, you would create a fair playing
ground for them. So access to resources and finances is very
important to our communities.
The other comment that was made that you need to understand
is other bureaucracies' impediments to us getting economic
development or to our governments having stronger capacity.
Well, the issue is, do they have the resources? So if you look
at our political structure as governments, do we have the legal
political infrastructure that is conducive to the private
sector coming onto the Indian reservations and conducting
business. So do they have recourse or do they have an incentive
to come on--you know, tax benefits and things of that nature.
Whether it is energy or whether it is creating widgets or
whether it is advancing different resources--you have timber
or, like in my area, fisheries industry--what is their
incentive to come into our reservations and do business?
My tribe shows you that we can be successful. There are
other tribes doing the same thing. We don't want you to be
skewed by the gaming industry that has been quite successful,
some of the tribes. Out of the 555, 230 or 240 are in the
gaming industry. Out of that 230 and 240, there are only a
couple--a triple dozen that actually are the really successful
ones you hear about, not the majority. They are more break
even, even though they created jobs.
But what it has done that you need to understand is that it
has created a new kind of resource made available to the tribal
government they now can invest into their communities and
diversify their economic development portfolio and do things
that the Federal Government can't do. So you see areas where
tribes are becoming more resourceful and more independent,
self-governance, a legislation that is very effective in us
negotiating for our fair share of the Federal system and let us
manage it.
So if you ask yourself, how much would it cost us to help
you become more independent? You don't have enough money. You
don't have enough money to deal with America's problems today.
We can't count on you to live up to those treaty commitments.
But if you empower us, if you help us become stronger as
government, we can get the job done and we can show you
countless examples where it is working.
So I am just touching on a few of the issues, Mr. Chairman.
This topic is a broad issue. There are people out there in the
Federal system who are trying and they have their own
constraints and there are regulatory impediments, no question
about that, that should be removed. But the issue is can you
count on us to become part of the health and economic fiber of
America. Yes, for the most part, we are in rural America; and
rural America is an equal part of the fiber of this Nation.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Lankford. Thank you very much for your testimony.
Let me run through just a few questions that I will have
and briefly get some more context on it.
Chairman Allen, are you on a reservation tribe or
nonreservation tribe?
Mr. Allen. I am a reservation tribe. I am a small
reservation. We own about a thousand acres. Of that thousand
acres, we have only about 35 actually in reservation status.
Mr. Lankford. OK. So the other--so you have a thousand
acres there. Thirty-five you're saying is in trust, is in
reservation status; that what you are saying?
Mr. Allen. Yes. And we have a lot of land that is in the
process--it was noted earlier about the land in the trust
process that had an impediment because of the Carcieri Supreme
Court decision. Once that is removed, then it opens up that
opportunity for that trust status, and many of us will
reacquire it, whether it is a ``checkerboard'' reservation or
whether it is on a reservation like ours trying to strengthen
our homeland base.
Mr. Lankford. OK. You mentioned, Chairman Allen, about
empowerment's better than forced assimilation. Can you give me
a specific example of what you would say, this is empowerment?
What would be helpful?
Mr. Allen. Relative to the assimilation policy?
Mr. Lankford. No, no, no. You were saying empowerment is
better than forced assimilation by far. So what I am looking
for is a specific example of what you mean.
Mr. Allen. Probably the one that comes quick to mind is, as
a government, if the government--even though we have
individuals we are trying to enhance with regard to their
business, as governments we have no economic base so we have no
revenue base. So our revenue base is based on the businesses
that we generate. So if we're going to become independent from
the Federal Government and become less dependent on it, then
that base has to be the foundation for these unrestricted
resources that deal with the unmet needs in our community.
Mr. Lankford. OK.
Mr. Allen. And so the issue for us would be the government
has to have the authority that resource is tax exempt. The
rules, the laws that recognize that unique stature of tribal
corporations and the revenue generated by it and the IRS
recognition of those, that authority, is a big deal to us and
as well as the authority--the unencumbered authority to secure
tax-exempt loans for economic development.
Mr. Lankford. Thank you.
Ms. Kendall, can I ask you a question about
fractionalization that came up earlier? Is there a list that is
available to the tribes of the land that is currently going
through--obviously, people are being contacted now based on
what just occurred last year and the purchase of lands and
people are being contacted to see if they want to be able to
combine that out, correct?
Ms. Kendall. Is your question are people being contacted?
Mr. Lankford. Well, yes. That is going on currently, is
that correct?
Ms. Kendall. I believe so.
Mr. Lankford. The question that I have is, are the tribes
made aware, because if the land is purchased back then it is
ceded to the tribe, is that correct, as trust lands?
Ms. Kendall. That's my understanding.
Mr. Lankford. Will the tribes be aware that this land is in
process? Is there any system that you know of that is in place
out there so the tribes know here is the land going through the
process and there are 10 that are still interested and 20 that
are not in the purchase process.
Ms. Kendall. What my understanding is, is the Department
has presently a program that addresses fractionation. It's been
a very small program up until the promise that the Cobell
settlement has. The Department for a number of reasons had not
put a plan in place until the approval goes through. They are
thinking about it. They are talking internally. But they have
not done the kind of proactive communication, I guess because
they don't want to sort of preempt the finalization of
settlement.
Mr. Lankford. OK, thank you. The question that we will try
to ask them directly on that and be able to track down that.
Director Mittal, a question for you on just dealing with
the dynamics of all of these issues that you are raising. You
raise some terrific issues on how did we get involved in this.
Some of this boils down to BIA really has a responsibility to
help businesses know how to navigate through Indian law and
dealing with their court systems and unique dynamics of that so
businesses will not feel prohibited to be there. They will be
encouraged to be there, and someone can help them navigate
through that.
Do you see anywhere out there a process that's in place
from BIA to say we are going help any business, whether it is a
McDonald's or whether it is a company that builds widgets, as
Chairman Allen mentioned before, that wants to be able to come
here so that someone will help them through that process? Does
that kind of program exist?
Ms. Mittal. I am not aware of such a program--such a
comprehensive program. There might be individual programs for
specific parts within BIA, for example, to help them navigate
the judicial system and things like that, but I'm not aware of
a comprehensive program like you just described.
Mr. Lankford. Ms. Kendall, are you aware of any type of
program like that would help outside businesses that want to be
able to invest in tribes know how to be able to navigate the
process?
Ms. Kendall. I am not, sir.
Mr. Lankford. That is one--we will try to be able to
followup on that one as well.
Director Mittal, you had also mentioned the patchwork of
environmental standards. Can you talk about just the
relationship, the States--the State, the tribe, and the Federal
all trying to work together, has that become an issue for
businesses being able to come in? And what are the solutions
that are being formed on that? Who's finding a way to solve
that, I guess I should say, or a success story?
Ms. Mittal. We haven't actually looked at the relationship
between those tribal standards and businesses. What our past
work has looked at is the conflict that creates between the
tribal governments and the States. So those are the issues that
we have seen that, in the past, that because the tribes have
this authority under the three acts they have created conflicts
with the States. For example, States don't like the fact that
the tribes are setting standards that are more stringent than
the State standard. So that's the area we have focused on. We
haven't done any extensive work looking at the effect it has
had on businesses.
Mr. Lankford. Thank you very much.
I am out of time, and I recognize the ranking member, Mr.
Connolly, for 5 minutes of questioning.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I see we have been joined by our full committee chairman. I
would be happy to yield to him, reclaiming my time when he is
finished.
Mr. Issa. That is very generous. The ranking member knows
that I generally am afraid to ask questions and then move to
another subcommittee. So very wise of you, Gerry. But thank
you.
I'll be brief. I've got just a couple of questions, and
they are sort of between the two government entities here.
Ms. Kendall, you produce IG reports and conduct audits and
investigations, report your finding to the BIA. Is BIA
responsive to the information you are sending them?
Ms. Kendall. Not always. We do get responses primarily on
the audit side. We request responses from investigations that
we provide to them.
Mr. Issa. Why do you think they don't respond with some
predictability?
Ms. Kendall. I wish I knew the answer, Mr. Chairman. I
simply don't. One of the feelings we get in the Office of
Inspector General is they are simply outwaiting us.
Mr. Issa. Hmm. You know, one of the things we like here is
that it is harder to outwait us. So it is an area we do want to
ask you to submit a good subsegment of ones that you feel that
you need a response for, haven't gotten a response, or at least
it would be helpful, and let us know about them. Because we
probably, in most cases, want to know as badly as you do and
will be able to ask independently. Quite honestly, those would
help educate us.
The chairman, the question that was actually more directed
toward our U.S. Government representatives, but I would ask
you, do you think there is any way that your tribe could
navigate through business attempts with the current BIA
support? Meaning, if you didn't hire your own lawyers at
whatever expense you have to pay for specialists that
understand the tribal process with BIA, do you think there is
any chance you could do it without that expense?
Mr. Allen. Yes.
Mr. Issa. Do you do it?
Mr. Allen. We are doing it.
Mr. Issa. Including land-in-trust applications.
Mr. Allen. No, the land in the trust is a Federal function
that we can't do. There are components of that process that we
could do, if they would accept it, including the environmental
review process. We do a lot of that for them. So that's where a
lot of the Federal functions can be taken over by us that
aren't essential Federal functions. That would make the process
move much smoother and much faster.
Mr. Issa. Let me do one followup question for either of the
tribal members. I have worked on land in trust for a number of
the tribes in my district and around the area. And even, for
example, when BLM is begging the tribe to take land that they
don't have the funds to maintain, that are not developable but
they have ancestral significance, we go through a long,
multiyear process to get it in trust. And so even when it is in
the Federal Government's best interests to deliver it, even
when the tribe is willing to pay for the future maintenance,
etc.--because I have some well-to-do tribes--you can't get the
process quickly, in concert with the Natural Resources
Committee, obviously the committee of primary jurisdiction.
I would ask all of you, do you believe that what we should
be doing is to come up with greater master plans of the
aspirations of tribes, commit land-in-trust designations so
that if fee land is acquired at any time it has already gone
through the process in a master plan, the same way as a city
often doesn't have all of its territory filled out, but it will
stake the claim to that. I would take it from both sides, if
you could, because it's an area I have never been able to move
along, but that I think would be part of that changing of it.
If you could literally clear those areas of aspiration so that
then when they become available through fee or other purposes
you could acquire them.
Please, Chairman.
Mr. Allen. Well, first of all, the answer is yes, that most
tribes have a comprehensive land use plan that usually includes
their existing reservation and their ceded territory where they
resided. And it can be a little complicated because in many of
our communities it overlaps into our sister tribes. So we have
to be respectful that our comprehensive plan, land plan, we
want to acquire lands for multiple reasons--economic
development, cultural reasons, natural resources, etc.--that
may overlap.
Some areas very clearly is in our territory of the tribe,
but some will overlap into other territories that our sister
tribe will have an interest in, and we have to resolve those
issues.
But there are some issues within the process that we have
to be careful. The U.S. Government does not want to take land
into trust. If there is any liability--I mean any liability--it
will not take any land in trust. So we have to go through--
that's why sometimes the process takes a long time.
There may be something identified, environmentally or so
forth, that the U.S. Government says we have a problem. Until
we get that resolved so that I have absolutely no liability,
this land will not be taken into trust. That has been the
biggest hiccup in the process--the Carcieri problem that we
currently are emerging.
Many tribes do not have that comprehensive plan in place,
and they should be encouraged to do that. Because their ceded
territory is often much greater than their reservation base.
Mr. Issa. My time has expired.
In the case of California, where they lost all of their
ancestral tribes, they were part of the mission system in most
cases, and even if they got it they were often checkerboards
where these fell out during the allotment period. That's the
area we have dealt with a lot, where when you buy a piece
within your contiguous border you still have to go through an
extensive and expensive process to get it in trust.
Any other comments? Because my time has expired. But if
there is anything else the committee should know about
expediting that process in order to allow for, particularly,
beneficial use?
Mr. Connolly, I am in your debt. I yield back.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
With the permission of the chair----
Mr. Lankford. Absolutely. I thank you for your courtesy on
that.
Mr. Connolly. Absolutely.
While the chairman is still here, I would like to followup
on his question to you, Ms. Kendall. I am not sure I understood
your answer.
You responded to Chairman Issa, when he said are you
getting cooperation from BIA, you seemed to suggest no, and you
seemed to suggest the reason you were given or the reason you
understood that lack of cooperation was they were waiting you
out. A, what kind of cooperation are you getting or not
getting? How have you communicated to them that won't be
acceptable? And ``waiting you out'' meaning what? You are the
Acting Inspector General and maybe when they get somebody else,
he or she will be friendlier?
Ms. Kendall. No, not at all, sir. This has been a
longstanding problem with BIA. And much of it has--not
necessarily with our audits or investigations, but we refer a
lot of allegations that we receive back to bureaus, and we do
that with BIA as well. We probably receive--almost 50 percent
of the allegations we receive relate to BIA. And so----
Mr. Connolly. The whole Department of the Interior?
Ms. Kendall. Yes. And so a good portion we will not
investigate ourselves or conduct an audit ourselves.
Mr. Connolly. Could I just interrupt you one more time just
to make sure we all understand what you are saying. Fifty
percent of the allegations--allegations implies fraud or a
crime.
Ms. Kendall. Allegations of wrongdoing one way or the
other, yes. So I can say affirmatively that, in the matters
that we refer to them to respond to themselves, they have been
very lacking in getting back to us and being responsive. And,
in fact, we have just really, in a sense of frustration,
decided we will close these matters out as nonresponsive and
start reporting them to Congress in our semiannual report.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you. And you are the only IG with
jurisdiction over the BIA?
Ms. Kendall. Yes, sir.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you.
Chairman Allen and Ms. Douville, please feel free to
comment as well, if you wish.
I just want to tick off some of the items that were cut or
eliminated in H.R. 1, the continuing resolution passed by party
line vote here in the House:
$581.3 million reduction for the State and local law
enforcement assistance account which tribal courts and
detention facilities receive funding from.
$17.9 million reduction to Office of Special Trustee for
American Indians.
$9 million decrease to the BIA construction account.
$900,000 reduction to the Indian land and water claim
settlement miscellaneous payments account.
Reductions proposed for Labor, Education, Health and Human
Services serving American Indians, Alaska natives, including
Head Start, tribal colleges, Native Americans serving nontribal
institutions, tribally controlled postsecondary vocational
institutions, and the list goes on.
A decrease of $139.3 million to the IHS facilities account,
which also affects tribal lands, and $200 million in reductions
to the Native American housing block grant program.
Would those reductions have any impact at all on the
quality of life on reservations or tribal lands?
Mr. Allen. Yes, absolutely. You know, there is no community
in America that is more underserved than American Indian
communities. All you have to do is look at the fact that our
average unemployment rate in Indian country is in the mid-30's,
just average. You go to Rosebud and Pine Ridge and some of
these other communities where it is in the 70's and 80's. It is
ridiculous.
The fact that these Head Start programs or these school
construction programs or roads programs or the reduction of
loan guarantee programs--all disincentives to invest in our
Indian communities. We don't have the physical infrastructure
to take care of our it community needs.
So it is not just about economic development. It is the
community infrastructure to be able to take care of our
families and our kids and to educate them and enhance their
abilities, to care for their needs.
Public safety, you want to talk about public safety issues?
You must know about the atrocities going on in our communities.
The violence against Indian women and families and our kids is
just terrible. It is just a sad commentary of what is going on
in society.
So we know that Congress is wrestling over the deficit
reduction, but we can tell you when you look at the $3 trillion
budget relative to where we are, the Indian communities, the
resources--the limited resources is a drop in the bucket. And
we know they are shaving them everywhere they can.
So I am telling you it is going to have a serious
detrimental impact to what marginal success we achieved in the
last couple of years. It has been stagnant. If you look at the
budget and the way we have been moving forward, the most
significant increases are in health care. But even in the
significant increases in health care you can see the fact that
we are still way behind when you measure every health care
category, that you measure the health status of our communities
and our people from the kids to the elders. And so it is a
struggle for us.
We see those programs--HUD program, go after a whole bunch
of programs, community programs and economic development
programs, natural resource enhancement programs, etc., that are
out there. Each one of those programs all make a difference in
our communities; and we are pushing to become stronger, more
vibrant. They all contribute and interface and are
interrelated.
So the answer is, yes, it is a detriment, a setback. It is
disappointing.
Because we think we are getting traction with Congress, and
we think Congress is listening to us, that we have some
problems and needs, you know, in appropriations. The chairman
says, we have a problem here. We are underserving Indian
communities so we are going to hold the line. We are going,
yes, hold the line, but also we are missing some serious needs
here. Whether it is Interior or HUD or DOL or Labor or
Commerce, each have a role in enhancing the welfare of our
governments and our communities.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you.
Ms. Douville. Yes, all these cuts in H.R. 1, they are
highly devastating to our tribes, especially to mine.
Historically, we have never been funded at 100 percent; and
that is the government trust responsibility to us.
Cutting the housing, the IHS, we have programs that need
this money. We have kids, children that depend on a lot of
this. And that is our future. That's what we consider sacred,
is our children. And cuts like this make it so hard, make it
even harder for us. And the hopelessness that I have talked
about earlier, it just pronounces it more.
So with these cuts, if the government would live up to
their trust responsibility, give us the 100 percent that we
need and we are asking for, then we won't be a burden, and that
would empower us to be just as equal as any other Nation within
our Nation.
So, yeah, this will hurt us, and it is going to hurt us.
But we are strong. We will survive. We survived for hundreds of
thousands of years. But with your help our quality of life
would be better.
Mr. Lankford. Ms. Kendall, earlier, you were talking about
some of the issues of waste--sorry, I was referencing--Mr.
Labrador. I apologize for that. Mr. Labrador.
Mr. Labrador. You are fine, Mr. Chairman. I actually yield
the time to you.
Mr. Lankford. Thank you.
You referenced earlier several issues that were coming up
where funding had been allotted. As I recall, you referenced a
48 percent increase in funding for detention centers. Than when
you went back years later there was no change. Are there
instances where funding is being allotted, how is that used?
What are you finding in these situations?
Ms. Kendall. The matter I am referring to specifically had
to do with staffing in Indian detention centers. And, as a
result, I believe in part of our 2004 report where staffing was
one of the multiple concerns, Congress appropriated BIA a
considerable amount of money--I think a 48 percent increase,
about $62 million or so. And what our effort was was to go see
how they spent that money; and, unfortunately, we could not
determine how they accounted for it. And very little, if
anything, was done to improve staffing.
Mr. Lankford. The frustration that is experienced here is
that there are so many different variant issues that we are
dealing with. There is just a multitude of both legal--with
land issues, with relationship issues with cities and with
States and with the Federal Government that we are making job
creation incredibly complex.
And the greatest need that I see on the outside of this,
and that is why I am asking coming in, is not necessarily
additional dollars. It is the capacity for jobs to grow on
their own and to be, as you mentioned before, Chairman Allen,
self-sustaining and not be dependent, but to be a fully
functioning national economy within the system that is
functioning there on the tribe. To where tribes, as you
mentioned before, the 230-some odd tribes that run casinos,
great, they are running a functioning business, whether that be
a wind farm to try to figure out the process of how to get that
up so it can be sold and so that jobs can exist there, or
whether that be a functioning business that is high tech, low
tech, manufacturing, whatever it may be. We have to figure out
the systems and the processes that need to be in place so that
this can thrive on its own.
Let me ask you, Ms. Douville, the type of jobs that exist
among the tribe and on tribal lands, you mentioned the wind
farms, great. You mentioned the casino that you have. What
other jobs and industries or business that are there onsite?
Ms. Douville. Right now, we have a lot of convenience
stores, grocery stores, schools. Our tribal government, of
course. And we employ about 500 to 600 people on the
reservation.
Mr. Lankford. Through the tribal government?
Ms. Douville. Through the tribal government.
We also have the Bureau of Indian Affairs, our agency
there. I am not sure how much they employ or how many of the
employees are Native American.
Mr. Lankford. How many members of the tribe that live
locally?
Ms. Douville. That live locally? Approximately 30,000.
Mr. Lankford. OK.
Ms. Douville. For our tribe.
But one thing that is highly pronounced on our reservation
is that our unemployment rate is above 85 percent. So a
majority of our people are unemployed. A lot of them are trying
to be self-employed with the arts and crafts and the resources
that we do have and the talents that they do have to try to get
some type of business off the ground. Yet, still it is hard.
Mr. Lankford. Sure. Obviously, we are scratching the
surface. This is an initial hearing, and that is what this is,
is fact-finding and hearing and to initiate the process and
then to disburse this to other committees that are engaged with
directly on it. You have identified multiple areas, both
written and orally, on it. If there is one area to look at and
say this one has to be resolved first, could you identify one
to say this is the key that has to be resolved first from the
Federal Government side, to make sure that we are pulling back
any impediment to job growth within any of these tribal areas?
Ms. Mittal. I will go first.
I think the land-in-trust issue has to be resolved. Because
until the tribes have a secure land base, they cannot undertake
the type of activities that the two tribal members have talked
about. They cannot conduct grazing, they cannot conduct
forestry, they cannot conduct business or gaming activities.
They need to have a secure land base.
And until this uncertainty that the Carcieri decision has
created is resolved, what we are concerned about is that more
and more tribes are going to come to Congress looking for
legislative solutions to this problem, rather than going
through the BIA application process.
Mr. Lankford. How do you see that being resolved? Is there
something that you look and say this is going to have to be
resolved here?
Ms. Mittal. I think there could be legislative solutions.
There could be court decisions that help resolve it. But there
are lots of different ways it can be resolved. It is a
definitional issue. We need to know what exactly does it mean
by Federal jurisdiction in 1934. So that could be resolved
either in the courts or by Congress.
Mr. Lankford. Well, the courts are down the streets, so we
will have to resolve it with legislative solutions here.
So I appreciate your testimony and your time, and other
folks that are here, and would be very pleased to be able to
receive, if you have additional comments and thoughts that you
may have that you want to be able to submit to Congress for us
to disperse to the other areas, you have 7 days to be able to
get those things back to us. So as things come up, we will be
very pleased to be able to contact you with followup questions
as they come up from there.
I am very grateful for your time, and I apologize that we
had a vote right in the middle of it and much delayed the
process we were going with.
Unless there are additional thoughts and comments on it,
this hearing is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 4:12 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
