INTERNAL CONTROL WEAKNESSES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

----------

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2011

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Government Organization, Efficiency
and Financial Management,
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in
room 2247, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Todd Russell
Platts (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Present: Representatives Platts, Lankford, Amash, and
Towns.
Staff present: Linda Good, chief clerk; Hudson T.
Hollister, counsel; Mark D. Marin, director of oversight; Tegan
Millspaw, research analyst; Nadia A. Zahran, staff assistant;
Jaron Bourke, minority director of administration; Beverly
Britton Fraser, minority counsel; Jennifer Hoffman, minority
press secretary; and Adam Koshkin, minority staff assistant.
Mr. Platts. Good morning. The subcommittee will come to
order.
A quick housekeeping, our understanding is votes on the
floor may happen, we thought 11, 11:30, now they are saying
maybe as early as the next 20 to 30 minutes. So we're going to
try to get through your testimony and hopefully a round of
questions. My worry is that when the votes go up, it may be a
long series. We are going to try not to have you sitting here
waiting. We will hope for votes being a little later than
expected.
The purpose of today's hearing, I am going to shorten my
opening remarks for the purpose of getting to your testimony as
quickly as we can. But the purpose of today's hearing is to
evaluate the effectiveness and security of financial systems at
the Department of Homeland Security. DHS is one of the largest
Federal departments and spent $56.4 billion on its operations
in 2010. Because of the size and importance of DHS, it is
crucial that we have strong financial management systems and
that data is properly protected.
However, in 2010, independent auditors found numerous
weaknesses in DHS' financial management and information
technology security systems. And this hearing will examine the
results of that audit and DHS' progress in resolving the
problems in its financial management systems.
The audit was conducted by the independent auditing firm
KPMG and identified 161 weaknesses in DHS' internal controls
over crucial financial systems. Almost two-thirds of the
weaknesses were repeats from KPMG's 2009 audit of the
Department. The findings contributed to five significant
weaknesses as well as one material weakness in information
technology and financial system functionality.
DHS has been working continuously to improve its financial
Management and its efforts should be acknowledged. However, as
this audit shows, there are still significant problems and the
Department must address these problems. Many of these
deficiencies are long-term that have never been resolved. This
hearing is intended to review the findings of the audit and
evaluate how we can better address these identified
deficiencies.
The subcommittee appreciates DHS' ongoing work to improve
its financial management and its cooperation and assistance
with the auditors. I certainly want to thank our witnesses for
being here today and to share your expertise and insights with
us to allow our committee in our oversight role to be more
effective in partnering with you and the full committee in
trying to achieve what we are all after, which is an efficient,
well-run, accountable Department, and how we handle the
public's funds and fulfill your mission, which is so important
to our Nation's security.
With that, I am going to submit my entire statement for the
record and yield to the ranking member, Mr. Towns from New
York, for the purposes of an opening statement.
Mr. Towns. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding
this hearing on such an important issue.
I thank our witnesses for their appearance before the
committee and for their testimony today. Ms. Sherry, it is good
to see you again.
Federal Government information systems are constantly under
threat of cyberattack. And the incidence of cyberattacks has
escalated in recent years. It is critical that we maintain
strong defenses to those attacks.
The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for the
cybersecurity of most of the executive branch agencies. It is
also responsible for protecting its own information systems
from attack.
Our success at keeping our information systems safe depends
on how well the Department executes internal controls over its
components. Today we examine the weaknesses in the Department's
internal controls and how we can eliminate them to improve
defenses against present and future threats.
In fiscal year 2010, the auditors from KPMG listed more
than 161 findings, as the chairman mentioned. The audit
concluded that old legacy computer systems are impairing the
functionality of DHS' financial management system as a whole.
The audit also found many weaknesses in controlling access to
sensitive data facilities and financial information in the
Department.
These weaknesses go straight to the heart of protecting
against outside threats and to equality of data that feeds the
DHS financial system. I would like to get answers to at least
two issues from this hearing today. First, what progress has
the Department made in the months since the audit report was
issued in addressing material weaknesses and IT control
deficiencies that were identified? Second, what is the status
of updating and integrating your old legacy computer system
that is impairing financial accountability in the Department?
As the Department successfully works through these issues,
we should begin to see a decrease in internal control
weaknesses over financial reporting and increased protection
over information system from threats within and outside of the
United States. This committee is here to assist you. This is
not one of those ``I gotcha'' committees, even though they do
exist here in this House. But this is not one. We are here to
see how we can work together and to see how we can help you.
And I know it, because at one time I was chairman, and the
chairman was ranking. And now you can see he is chairman and I
am ranking. So we have been working on this for quite some time
and we are willing to continue to work with you.
On that note, I yield back and I recognize the schedule,
Mr. Chairman, and I am willing to cooperate with you in every
way I can to make certain that we follow it.
[The prepared statement of Hon. Edolphus Towns follows:]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T3167.001

Mr. Platts. I thank the gentleman, and I appreciate your
very appropriate remarks, that our effort is about partnering,
partnering between us in a non-partisan way, as chairman and
ranking member, chairman and ranking member reversed in the
past, and with you, and that we are all after that same goal.
We are delighted to have several very distinguished
witnesses before us who bring great insights into the issues
that we are addressing here today. We are going to first start
with Ms. Peggy Sherry, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, as well
as Acting Chief Financial Officer at the Department of Homeland
Security; Mr. Robert West, Chief Information Security Officer
at the Department; Mr. John McCoy, Deputy Assistant Inspector
General for Audits at the Office of Inspector General for the
Department of Homeland Security.
If I could, it is the practice of the committee that we
swear in all of our witnesses. So if I could ask the three of
you to stand and raise your right hands.
[Witnesses sworn.]
Mr. Platts. Thank you. You may be seated. The Clerk will
reflect that the witnesses answered in the affirmative. And
again, I apologize for the abbreviated introductions. But to
try and accommodate everyone's schedules, we will go to your
testimony. If you can try to limit it to about 5 minutes, your
full testimonies are submitted for the record. Then we will get
into questions.
Ms. Sherry, if you could begin?

STATEMENTS OF PEGGY SHERRY, DEPUTY CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER,
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, ACCOMPANIED BY ROBERT
WEST, CHIEF INFORMATION SECURITY OFFICER; AND JOHN E. McCOY II,
DEPUTY ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR AUDITS, OFFICE OF THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

STATEMENT OF PEGGY SHERRY

Ms. Sherry. Thank you very much. Thank you, Chairman
Platts, Ranking Member Towns and members of the committee, for
the opportunity to provide information on the fiscal year 2010
audit findings and the processes that have been put in place to
correct our internal control weaknesses.
When DHS was formed, our initial audits identified
pervasive material weakness conditions in the financial systems
security controls across all DHS components. There was strong
partnership between my office and the Chief Information
Security Officer. We have been successful in correcting many IT
control risks. And by fostering a positive working relationship
with the Office of the Inspector General and our external
auditors, we have been able to move the Department forward in
addressing IT and financial management control weaknesses.
Over the past few years, we have significantly reduced IT
material weakness conditions and largely contained them to
three components. We expect this year's audit to reflect
significant progress at the U.S. Coast Guard, FEMA and at ICE.
In addition to our strong partnership with the Chief
Information Security Officer, we have also developed a focused
approach to systematically evaluating the areas of greatest
risk. Components developed action plans to target these high
risk areas, and my office reviewed and provided input to ensure
these plans are comprehensive, reasonable and address the root
cause of our IT weaknesses.
Over the past 5 years, the Department has made significant
progress improving our internal control environment, including
the IT environment. During 2007 and 2008, the CFO and CISO
worked together to build an internal control program to assess
controls over our CFO-designated systems. We provided
comprehensive guidance to the entire Department on how to
secure financially significant systems.
In 2009, we used that guidance to perform a baseline IT
internal control assessment at many of our components. This
assessment included testing the design and effectiveness of IT
controls. Due to the repeating nature of some IT findings, in
fiscal year 2010, we focused on ensuring that the Department's
IT plans of action were addressing and designed to address the
root causes of the most material IT findings. And we used
independent verification and validation techniques to ensure
corrective actions were being implemented across the IT control
environment.
This targeted approach allowed us to address many of the
causes of repeat IT NFRs with the goal of permanent correction.
I would like to highlight some of the work undertaken this year
to address specific component findings. The U.S. Coast Guard
has created an oversight process to identify and evaluate
systems scripts or computer processing code that have an impact
on financial statements. The Coast Guard also updated their
policies and procedures, developed a desk guide to provide
training and created a segregation of duties policy.
Along with my office and Mr. West's office, the FEMA CFO
and CIO worked very closely this year, and as a result,
significant progress in closing system audit findings occurred.
They instituted a recertification process for users of the
National Emergency Management Information System and remediated
many control deficiencies surrounding the National Flood
Insurance program.
ICE also made progress this year, and in the coming months,
they will be updating their data base server. This improvement
will make needed corrections in ICE's financial system, and
along with increased training and user awareness provide
greater controls against duplicate payments in the future.
This is just some of the work our components continue to do
to remediate control deficiencies and demonstrate progress to
adhere to the tenets of the Financial Accountability Act. Even
though the Department has shown significant improvement over
the past few years in financial Management and in improving
systems security, financial management remains challenging as a
result of IT functionality limitations in certain financial
systems.
Some legacy systems limit our ability to develop
application controls to support financial reporting and
operations, limit our ability to provide timely and accurate
data, and contribute to inefficient labor-intensive processes
and the need for extensive workarounds and compensating manual
controls. Limitations include lack of integration in some of
our systems, IT system configuration limitations, systems
lacking key application controls, which are more efficient and
effective and reliable than manual controls. These conditions
hinder our ability to provide sustainable internal controls to
support the audit as well as to ensure our control systems are
designed to achieve our missions, which is another key
objective of the Financial Accountability Act.
These weaknesses highlight the need to modernize certain
legacy systems, and this remains a priority for the Department.
While we work with components to develop a path forward, we
continue to help them to improve and standardize their business
processes and internal controls. We are implementing a common
line of accounting and we are developing common data standards,
all very critical.
Using the objectives outlined in the Accountability Act, we
continue to make significant progress in improving financial
Management. I am fortunate to work with the dedicated staff at
DHS, as well as have the support of Department leadership and
the Chief Information Security Officer and our auditors, as we
continue these efforts.
I thank you for and appreciate the efforts we have received
from this committee and Congress, and I look forward to working
with you in the future. I am happy to take questions later,
sir.

STATEMENT OF ROBERT WEST

Mr. West. Chairman Platts, Ranking Member Towns and members
of the committee, thank you and good morning. I am Robert West,
Chief Information Security Officer for the Department of
Homeland Security, and I would like to provide you an update on
the Department's progress in addressing the Department's IT
financial management control weaknesses. Department leadership
takes all audit findings seriously and we are fully committed
to resolving these issues as quickly as possible.
First, I would like to acknowledge the progress that we
have made in improving the Department's overall IT security
posture since the standup of the Department in 2003. Over the
last 8 years, we have reduced both IT security risks and costs
by successfully transitioning from a highly decentralized IT
environment to a modern enterprise ecosystem, with a robust set
of shared services and common security controls.
DHS inherited a complex legacy environment that included
approximately 1,100 separate and unique IT systems and one
where each system owner was individually accountable for all
security controls. Today, our IT systems are more secure than
ever before, due in large part to the fact that we have
instituted an enterprise security architecture. We call it
mission assurance through defense in depth.
We have consolidated six legacy wide area networks into a
single, secure, modern, fully encrypted backbone
infrastructure, and we have also made significant progress in
consolidating multiple data centers into two modern enterprise
data centers. These new data centers have been designed also
with a robust set of security controls that support all
systems, including financial systems that operate in these
environments. We have also consolidated our internet access
behind redundant trusted internet connections.
Within this enterprise environment, the Department today
operates 783 systems in support of the various missions of the
Department, and 32 of these systems support the Department's
financial management and reporting and are considered material
to the financial statements. Most of these financial systems
have been in operation for many years, and they predate the
Department's creation in 2003.
While these systems are certainly more secure due to the
fact that they operate within the enterprise environment that I
explained, some of these systems are still missing a number of
important systems-specific controls, and cannot fully support
business processes that ensure accurate financial reporting.
Heavily manual processes are still required to compensate for a
lack of fully automated technical controls, highlighting the
need to modernize these legacy systems.
Second, I would like to briefly discuss the nature of
audits themselves. Auditors necessarily report what they
observe. And often those reported observations are only
symptoms of larger issues. For this reason, the Department not
only systematically reviews all notice of findings and
recommendations with component leadership, we also require at
least one action plan for each finding issued. Additionally, we
also have institutionalized a three-phased approach to identify
and better understand systemic issues. This approach includes a
current state assessment, root cause analyses and independent
validation and verification of component action plans by the
Department.
We have also provided root cause analysis training to
components, so they can better develop realistic corrective
action plans that address root causes.
Finally, significant weaknesses identified in the 2010 IT
management letter center around five key areas: access
controls, configuration management, security management,
contingency planning and segregation of duties. I have outlined
specific actions taken to address each of these areas in
written testimony. I would be happy to discuss each of those in
more detail if you desire.
In closing, I would like to reiterate that the Office of
the CIO, including my office, along with the Office of the
Chief Procurement Officer, Program Accountability and Risk
Management Office and all appropriate component offices are
working closely together to ensure financial modernization
projects are planned and executed to meet reporting
requirements and minimize costs for financial operations. DHS
remains fully committed to improving our financial systems
security in order to provide timely, accurate and complete
financial information to our key stakeholders, including you,
the Congress, and the American taxpayers.
Thank you.
Mr. Platts. Thank you, Mr. West.
Mr. McCoy.

STATEMENT OF JOHN E. McCOY II

Mr. McCoy. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Towns
and members of the committee. I am John McCoy, II, Deputy
Assistant Inspector General for Audits with the Department of
Homeland Security.
Thank you for inviting me today to discuss financial
management weaknesses at DHS. My testimony today will focus on
information technology [IT] issues, identified during the
fiscal year 2010 financial statement audit conducted by the
independent accounting firm, KPMG.
In fiscal year 2010, KPMG identified 161 IT deficiencies,
of which approximately 65 percent are repeated from fiscal year
2009. KPMG also noted that DHS's financial systems had many
functional limitations that affect the Department's ability to
implement and maintain internal controls.
From a financial statement perspective, DHS's five most
significant weaknesses are access controls, configuration
Management, security management, contingency planning and
segregation of duties. KPMG noted access control weaknesses at
several of the DHS components that allowed excessive potential
for unauthorized access to key financial systems. Also at
several of the components, KPMG observed configuration
management controls that were not fully defined, followed or
effective.
Security management weaknesses were identified at several
DHS components where financial systems as well as general
support systems were not properly certified and accredited.
KPMG also found scenarios where roles and responsibilities were
not clearly defined, a lack of policies and procedures and non-
compliance with existing policies.
KPMG noted weaknesses in continency planning. There were
instances of incomplete or outdated business continuity plans,
systems with incomplete or outdated disaster recovery plans.
Some plans were not adequately tested and did not contain
current system information, emergency processing priorities or
procedures for backup and storage.
At several of the DHS components, KPMG noted a lack of
proper segregation of duties for roles and responsibilities
within financial systems. Collectively, these IT control
deficiencies limited the Department's ability to ensure the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of critical
financial and operational data. KPMG considers these control
deficiencies to collectively represent a material weaknesses
for DHS under established professional auditing standards.
The fiscal year 2010 audit also looked at the functionality
of DHS's financial systems. Many of the Department's financial
systems have not been substantially updated since the creation
of DHS. Some components cannot modify IT system core software
or install controls to prevent duplicate payments. This
contributed to duplicate payments made by Immigration and
Customs Enforcement in fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011. These
and other IT system limitations also lead to extensive manual
and redundant procedures to process transactions, verify the
accuracy of data and prepare financial statements.
DHS has made several attempts to modernize its financial
systems. Its most recent initiative was the Transformation and
Systems Consolidation [TASC]. TASC was canceled in March 2011
after the Government Accountability Office sustained one of the
bid projects. GAO recommended that DHS reevaluate the
requirements with regard to the estimated scope and pace of
work, as well as the integrated solution requirement.
In September, the Under Secretary of Management announced
the Department would now pursue a decentralized approach
instead of an enterprise-wide solution. Implementation of a new
financial systems solution combined with improving IT security
controls should allow the Department to achieve greater
effectiveness in its financial management.
We will continue our positive working relationship with the
Department by taking a proactive approach to overseeing DHS's
financial management and IT security improvement efforts. We
look forward to continuing our audit efforts and providing the
results and solutions to the Secretary and to the Congress.
Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement. Thank
you for this opportunity. I welcome any questions from you or
the Members.

Mr. Platts. Thank you, Mr. McCoy. Again, thanks to all
three of you for your testimony here today, as well as your
written testimony. Having that in advance certainly allowed me
to be better prepared for today's hearing.
I guess I want to start, one of the things that jumps out,
and Mr. McCoy just referenced it in his testimony, the 65
percent repeat deficiencies. This is the 2010 fiscal year that
we are still looking at, 2011 has just ended. If each of you
would want to comment based on the best of your ability at this
point, what are we likely to see on the 2011 audit regarding
repeat deficiencies, and what progress are we making?
In the ones that are identified, we are doing a better job
of closing them and shrinking that number, because we did
start, as you referenced, Mr. West, in the legacy systems, some
dramatic challenges. I think 18 material weaknesses when the
Department was first formed. But that was 8 years ago. And we
are now 8 years later. So if each of you could comment on the
issue of the repeat weaknesses and what to expect in the coming
audit.
Ms. Sherry. Thank you, Chairman. Yes, that is something
that clearly, Mr. West and I, when we had seen the number of
the repeat findings, was something that we really realized that
we did have to address. I think that the process that we have
used over the last 5 years has really gotten us to the point
where we will see some success this year, we will see more
remediation.
In particular, you will notice that the IG and the KPMG had
pointed out that FEMA in particular had had issues in this
area. As far as part of the process they identified at the
beginning of the year, do they think they have actually
corrected a particular finding? FEMA in particular had
identified things that they thought were corrected, which in
fact were not corrected.
One of the approaches that we used this year for the last
few years was really to identify, work very closely with the
components to see if they were identifying the root causes of
the NFRs. As Mr. West pointed out, sometimes it is just a
symptom, it doesn't really point to exactly the reasons why you
are having particular weaknesses.
So his office and my office worked very closely with the
CIO over at FEMA, as well as the CFO, which was a new paradigm
for us. We had been working very closely together. Clearly it
has worked well for the Department, encouraging the components
to do that as well. So they worked very closely. And I think
that what you will see this year is FEMA really was able to
better assess which of those NFRs they would be able to
correct. The reason they were able to do that is because they
were, to be able to address the root causes, they were also
able to work with their business partners within FEMA to really
identify what those root causes are. So I think that what you
will see this year is improvement in that particular area.
Mr. Platts. I appreciate the focus on FEMA. I think over a
third of the deficiencies are FEMA, and I think 80 percent of
FEMA's are repeat deficiencies.
Ms. Sherry. That is exactly right.
Mr. Platts. So that focus, I think, in the big picture
helps, and hopefully that carries across all the component
agencies.
Ms. Sherry. Yes, sir.
Mr. Platts. Mr. West or Mr. McCoy.
Mr. West. Yes, sir, I would like to make two comments. One,
I don't want to minimize the importance of the findings, and we
take all findings seriously. Our goal is to close all audit
findings. We use the fact that some are associated with a
material weakness as a way to prioritize our efforts.
Mr. Platts. Right.
Mr. West. But any finding is something that needs to be
closed. And I want to acknowledge that up front.
I haven't said that, when you look at the way the process
works, unlike the FISMA audit, which is my other world, the
FISMA audit is generally a snapshot in time, and it is just,
this is the state of the program at a given date. With the
financial systems audits, we have to show the auditors, we have
to convince the auditors that controls have been effective for
the entire audit cycle, generally a year, before we can close
them.
So the way the process works is that there will be a notice
of findings and recommendations, sometimes with maybe as many
as seven or eight specific findings within that one NFR. We
remediate. At some point we believe that we fix the problem and
we assert the next audit cycle back to the auditors that we
think this is closed. The auditors then review that, and they
can either agree and close the audit, they can--six of eight
are closed, but you still have work to do. Or they in some
cases even will get, a number of cases, frankly, will get
audit, NFRs issued, whereas it is findings with no
recommendations, meaning okay, we think the controls you have
put in place are good, you have solved the problem, but we
can't rely on it for the entire audit cycle, the whole year.
So when we get repeat findings, I would temper that just a
bit. I don't want to downplay it. Like I say, we take them all
seriously. But there is an audit pace that goes with these. And
it is generally 1 or 2 years before you actually get to the
point where something is fully closed with the auditors.
The second thing I want to mention real quick is with FEMA.
The thing that I think, the issue in 2010 with FEMA being the
large majority is that the way that they were looking at NFRs
at that time, they were really kind of looking at them more
from a FISMA perspective, as I talked about. So with the CFO
and my office together, we went into FEMA, we did some training
and the CFO and the CIO at FEMA really, they instituted a whole
program around how to review NFRs before they make assertions
back to the auditors that the findings have been closed.
They put that process in place and the auditors can verify
this, but in my view what FEMA is doing today in that regard is
the best practice for the government. And as a result, I can't
speak for the 2011 audit, we are still in the middle of it. I
really don't know how we are going to end up. I hope we will
end up, I am confident we will end up in a better place. But I
think with FEMA, you will see significant progress for that
very reason.
Mr. Platts. Good. Mr. McCoy.
Mr. McCoy. Yes, sir. We are identifying this year that the
Department is making progress. As Mr. West said, the audit is
ongoing. It will be over in approximately 2 weeks. At that
point in time we will be issuing the report. We have identified
improvement at FEMA. Last year, as noted in the report, FEMA
said they had closed 80 percent plus of their NFRs at the
beginning of the audit of those they identified, and KPMG
disagreed with that. This year, all the ones that KPMG has
completed looking at, KPMG concurs with management that the
findings have in fact been closed. There is definite
improvement this year.
Mr. Platts. Thank you. I yield to the ranking member.
And my intent is, the votes just went up. There is going to
be one vote and then debate, motion to recommit debate, and
then another series of votes. What my intent is is to go to
about a quarter of, just get what we can in. I am going to go
over, cast one vote, come back and it may just be me coming
back, depending on the schedule. Because we will have maybe
another 25 minute window, so you are not here waiting very
long, come back, have another 20, 25 minutes, and then we will
wrap up when we get back for the final series.
With that, I yield to the ranking member.
Mr. Towns. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Ms. Sherry, I guess I will start with you. Given the
absence of an integrated, streamlined financial management
program at FEMA, will FEMA continue to produce a reliable
financial data using its current information technology system,
which is still antiquated?
Ms. Sherry. Yes, sir, you make a very good point. FEMA's
system is old, it is outdated, it is proprietary. I believe it
is not even supported at this particular point.
FEMA, like many of the components where they have a legacy
system that is not completely modernized, either with the right
patches in it, in the right configuration management, they have
to have various compensating controls or manual controls,
things that are outside of those application controls within a
well-performing system in order to be able to compensate for
some of those weaknesses. So FEMA is able to attest and
represent to their balances at this particular point.
As you know, sir, we are still just doing a balance sheet
audit, as well as the custodial statement. But at this point,
they are able to do it. But with a modern system, it would
clearly be a more efficient process and one that would not have
to, you would have to develop audit trails outside of the
system. Instead, the auditors should be able to rely on those
audit trails within the system, if you have strong application
controls. So again, it is just not as efficient a process, and
there are manual controls that are required, which is, as you
know, are subject to, they are prone to errors, maybe not as
accurate and certainly not as timely.
Mr. Towns. Right. Let me ask this. If there is a situation
where the auditor comes in and they make these recommendations
and you feel that it is really not necessary, that your
information is accurate and that there is no need to make any
changes, what happens in a situation like that? Right down the
line.
Ms. Sherry. I will start real quickly. We have been very,
very fortunate. Since I have been at the Department, for a
little over 4\1/2\ years, we have had an incredible
relationship with the IG, as well as with our external
auditors. They have made every effort to get to know the
component very well, and we have made every effort in my office
to be able to make sure that we had a real good understanding
of exactly what those recommendations are.
So I am happy to report that there are, there really are
not times where we just absolutely disagree with the auditors.
As Mr. West had pointed out, many times your notice of finding
of recommendations really highlights certain conditions.
Sometimes they don't necessary go to the root cause.
One of the best practices that the auditors implemented
this year, actually maybe even last year, was to have the
Department really take a look at what those root causes are. So
what they do is when they give us a particular finding, they
don't necessarily come right out and give you the road map on
how to fix this. This has been really important in really
developing competencies within the Department, really training
people and really, how do you understand what is in that hot
notice of finding of recommendation and how do you go about
fixing it.
So I am pleased to report that we really don't have
disagreements with the auditors. They may not prescribe
necessarily how we go about fixing something, leave it up to
the Department to figure that out. And really the way we have
been working since I have been with the Department, really
building those competencies, so that we are able to address it,
with recommendations that are actually going to fix the
problems.
Mr. Towns. Mr. West, do you want to comment on that?
Mr. West. Yes, sir. I would make two comments. I would
agree with Ms. Sherry completely about the auditors. I think we
have really been fortunate in that we had a lot of continuity
in the IG office for a number of years, pretty much since the
beginning, as well as with the financial auditors, KPMG. It is
the same audit team, with a few exceptions, or few changes, I
guess, the same audit team has been our financial auditors for
a number of years. As a result of that, we have gotten to know
them and we have a very close working relationship as a result
of that.
The other thing I would say is that, I would agree with Ms.
Sherry, there are very few times when there is just
disagreement. And we generally sit down and work through what
the issue is. And we generally come to an agreement.
The one area where, in the past, maybe there has been, and
this is going back to FEMA again, has been an issue that we
have resolved in policy actually now, is around FISMA and the
audit standards for FISMA and with the NIST standards, National
Institute of Standards and Technology standard. And then the
FISCAM, or the Financial Information Security Controls Audit
Manual, published by GAO. And they really are coming at it from
different perspectives. So we think something is good in the
FISMA world, but there are additional things we need to do to
be able to show controls were effective for the entire year,
for example.
So as a result of that, we have actually modified policy.
We have systems that we believe are material to the financial
statement, we call them in policy CFO-designated financial
systems. And we put additional requirements in policy specific
to those systems, so there really is no confusion. I won't say
no, but we have really minimized the confusion. Generally when
the auditors say this is an issue, they are referring back to
our policy, and it is something that we would agree with.
Mr. Towns. Do you want to add?
Mr. McCoy. Yes, sir. As Ms. Sherry indicated, 2 years ago
we started the policy of having the Department evaluate the NFR
and come up with the best recommendation or the best way that
the Department could remediate it. Management knows their core
businesses better than the auditors. We identify the condition,
but we may not always identify the root cause. So that
definitely improved the remediations in 2009 and 2010, as well
as 2011.
Also I think this year, with the Department's involvement
at FEMA, it has produced more of a culture change related to
the financial statement audit and improvements with the
financial statement NFRs and remediation . So there has
definitely been improvement this year at FEMA.
Mr. Towns. I am happy to hear that, because looking at it
from the outside, you would think that even if recommendations
are made that there would come a dispute and it would take
years and years to work it through. So I am happy to know that
is not the case.
On that note, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Platts. I thank the gentleman.
Picking up on that issue, not so much disagreements between
the Department and auditors, but the relationship between the
Department and the components. One of the things I think that
has helped get us heading in a strong direction is the
relationship between Mr. West, Ms. Sherry, the two of you
partnering and working hand in hand at the Department level. I
think that has paid great dividends and will continue to. I
thank you for that approach and that leadership you are
providing.
One of the challenges you have is you are called to testify
here about the audits of the Department, and the challenge is
in the audits of some of the specific components, FEMA in
particular, ICE, Coast Guard. The relationship that you have
with your counterparts, or I would say subordinates, they might
not see it that way, but for the CFO at FEMA, CIO at FEMA or
ICE, can you share, I guess, is there a chain of command that
has been strengthened within the Department that, if you as
acting CFO for the Department contact FEMA CFO about
remediation requirements or whatever it may be in this area,
that it is seen as that individual being given in essence an
order or marching orders from a superior?
Ms. Sherry. Yes, Chairman. I am happy to say that in the
time that I have been at DHS, what I have really seen is a
great evolution in that relationship. I do believe that the
CFOs, the components, the CIOs as well as the security officers
and the chief financial officers within each of the components
do look to the Department really to set the tone on overall
financial management and are not out there basically trying to
circumvent the policies of the Department.
We do this in many ways. We meet at the beginning of the
year and then we meet periodically throughout the year to
really jointly set what our strategic plan is for the
Department. What we do is we set out what our objectives are.
At the beginning of last year, we set out the very aggressive
goal of obtaining a qualified opinion this year on our balance
sheet. The primary reason we needed to do that is because we
want to be able to have a full scope audit. Recognizing I was
never going to be able to bring the Department to that, to be
able to have that additional scrutiny over all of our
statements until such time as we got a balance sheet, we
jointly set out, all the CFOs jointly set out in our strategic
plan was to be able to obtain a qualified opinion this year,
which meant that, in particular the Coast Guard had a lot of
work to do. But many of the other components had their
objectives as well that they really needed to achieve.
And then what we do is, we have statements that they sign
off on to be able to agree to these particular goals. And the
we meet with them periodically on them. I am happy to report
that we have very little difficulty being able to work together
on our overall objective as a community in DHS.
Mr. Platts. That is good to hear. I guess a specific
follow-up is, if in laying out that game plan, how to go
forward, if you have, whether it is Coast Guard or FEMA, ICE,
any of the component entities, that is not meeting what they
need to do to have the overall departments succeed in this
effort, how do you rectify that? Because you don't have any say
in the hiring or firing of those component CFOs, is that
correct?
Ms. Sherry. Actually, the Department does have a role in
being able to hire certain people within the components. That
would include both the chief financial officer, the deputy
chief financial officer and other key positions, such as the
budget director.
Mr. Platts. So would you go to the Under Secretary?
Ms. Sherry. Absolutely. And if I had any issues at this
particular point, I have direct lines to the Secretary as well
as the Deputy Secretary and the Under Secretary. In fact, I
meet with the Deputy Secretary on a very regular basis. Every
Thursday morning, we get together. There is a group of her key
leaders that get together with her and meet with her on a
myriad of financial management issues. Clearly over the last
couple of months, one of those key issues has been the audit.
Mr. Platts. With the Deputy Secretary?
Ms. Sherry. Yes, that is correct.
Mr. Platts. Each Thursday?
Ms. Sherry. Absolutely. And then we meet on a less regular
basis with the Secretary, but we get that information up to her
as well. The Under Secretary for Management, we meet with him
on a bi-weekly basis. We meet with him very regularly, but we
meet with him on a bi-weekly basis on specific audit issues.
And the Deputy Secretary has made, in fact, a statement that
she made to me 45 days ago or so was that if there is any time
that you need me to be able to ``bang a head'' she said you
call me at any time. She said it doesn't matter when it is, if
you need me to get behind you in order to be able to make sure
that we achieve the objectives that we set out this year, you
reach out to me.
Mr. Platts. I am glad to hear that, because that is one of
the concerns, and we have seen it in the past with, Ranking
Member Towns, I know you remember, NASA, a similar type
challenge, where the administration at the senior level, but
then you had all the separate NASA centers that weren't
necessarily directly responding to the CFO. So I am glad to
hear, that, and it also goes to the issue that we don't have,
we are grateful for the great work you are doing, but a Senate-
confirmed compliance with the statute as written, Senate-
confirmed CFO, which I believe would give you even greater
weight within the Department when you are out there with those
component agencies. But I am glad to hear that the effort is to
make sure that is what is happening from the top down.
I am going to try to squeeze one more in question in here.
As I said, I am going to then run over, cast one vote, come
back, have about 20 minute or so for a couple more questions,
and then we will not hold you again, because it will be a
little while after that before the vote series ends.
On the most significant weaknesses identified, access
controls, and three in particular, access controls, segregation
of duties, contingency planning, and I will maybe get into them
in a little more detail when I come back. But I want to, I
guess contingency planning, that one, this Department came out
of the attack of 9/11. And the fact that we're a Nation under
attack, and there was obviously an unprecedented emergency.
Yet we have this Department not setting an example for the
rest of the Federal Government as we like it to to better
prepare for those types of emergencies in how you manage your
data, your information technology systems. So where are we and
what do we need to do to address that, that DHS, out of all the
departments and agencies, is a role model for contingency
planning when it comes to information security?
Mr. West. Sir, I will speak to that. Specifically the
financial systems in the 2010 audit, you are right, what can I
say. But all systems, all financial systems and all NFRs
associated with contingency planning in the 2010 audit, we went
back directly to the components and said, you need to update
your contingency plan, if you don't have one, you need to
produce one. And every one of those systems now has a
contingency plan that has been tested. We are still waiting on
the results from the auditors as to how we close it out, with
some exceptions. And those exceptions, we now have required a
plan of action from each component for each system.
Mr. Platts. Which components or systems?
Mr. West. I would have to get back to you on the details,
if you would like.
Mr. Platts. Okay.
Mr. West. But those, we do have plans of action for those.
And we have given them 6 months. In some cases, big systems,
there is a bit of a lift to get them, so we have given them 6
months. But within 6 months, those will all be remediated.
Mr. Platts. Okay, great. Good. I am glad to hear it. I
think that is important, because again, setting that example,
given how your department came to be formed in response to an
emergency.
On the issue of, I will try to squeeze this in here
quickly, segregation of duties. Again, it seems to me, I look
at it as a more basic internal control, that you can't be the
one approving the check and writing the check and then checking
if the check, I mean, why are we failing in that regard? A
fairly straightforward internal control.
Ms. Sherry. I agree, Chairman, it is absolutely one of the
most important internal controls that you should have. And I
think there are two pieces of it. One is from a functional
standpoint, what are those particular roles and
responsibilities that someone should have that potentially
could be in conflict, to cause an internal control weakness.
So kind of the best practice is, you shouldn't be able to
certify a payment as well as initiate a p.o. or something, a
purchase order or something. So the ability to be able to
articulate what those conflicting roles are is very critical.
The Department has been able to do that. We have done that for
some time as part of our A123 process.
The difficulty gets into is when you are actually in the
system. If you have a particular system that allows you to do
those types of things. So in other words, you know you
shouldn't enter a purchase order and then turn around and
approve a payment. But if the system either does not have those
preventive application controls in them, or they are not
configured appropriately, there is the possibility that you
could go in there and do that as well.
Mr. Platts. I assume we are trying to well identify those
system weaknesses to then correct.
Ms. Sherry. That is exactly right. And those are clearly
what, those are the high risk ones. And one of the processes
that we did, or our approach this year, over the last couple of
years, in particular this year, was to really look at those
high risk ones, such as segregation of duties. If you have a
particular system that is not configured in a way that prevents
you from doing that, where are those detective controls that
you have out there.
So developing those policies and procedures, training
people so that they know that those are incompatible
responsibilities, and then to the extent possible, going in
behind and making sure that something hasn't happened.
Mr. Platts. Get to that root cause.
Ms. Sherry. Absolutely, yes, sir. That is right.
Mr. Platts. With that, we are going to stand in recess for
about 10 minutes. And I will be right back.
[Recess.]
Mr. Platts. I didn't realize I could be that quick.
[Laughter.]
I do appreciate your patience. On the floor, we have 10
minutes of debate and another series of votes, which means we
probably have about 15 to 20 minutes before running back
across.
The other issue, in addition to contingency planning,
segregation of duties, is specifically the access control
deficiency area. And maybe where we are on that, and I know
with the new identification card and how that will play into
trying to ensure that we are not allowing, and maybe especially
the issue of former contractors or former employees who haven't
been shut off after leaving the Department, if we could address
that. Please, Mr. West?
Mr. West. Yes, sir. You are exactly right about the issue.
The biggest issue with access controls as identified in the
audit center around the inability in some cases to quickly
remove or deactivate accounts when people either move on for
whatever reason, either they are an employee and they have left
the Department, moved to another department, or component
within the Department, and especially contractors who, frankly,
come and go with the contract.
So we have done some remediation work around that. The
components have put processes in place to where they will
review the account list, the approved account list on some
periodicity. Generally it is like 90 days. I think in one case
it may be 6 months. Don't quote me on that. But they have
manual processes in place to review periodically the removal of
accounts and determine which ones are still valid.
That is kind of a band-aid on a bigger issue. And as you
mentioned, the Department is aggressively deploying HSPD 12
common access cards. And the goal is to get to the point where
we can use those for mandatory logical access at some point. We
are working on a plan to get to that as quickly as possible.
The Deputy Secretary is very interested in that herself. The
CIO and I also meet with her regularly and this is a key issue
not just for financial systems but for the Department more
generally.
And then once we have HSPD 12 cards, then we will be able
to upgrade the individual applications to take advantage of
that, so that we will be able to remove people in more real
time. But I think until we have that identity capability on
sort of a core infrastructure, until we have that, we are going
to still have to rely on these manual processes, reviewing
access lists periodically like we are doing today.
Mr. Platts. And the periodic 90-day review, double checking
that no one is still on that list, ideally you get to where it
is more automated, with the access card. But is there a more
real basic internal control of a process when an employee
leaves the Department, whoever their superior is, that I would
think has a checklist of what you go through, you turn in your
key, you turn in your badge. And I make sure that your access
from a technology standpoint is cut off. I would assume that
there is that type of more basic human-oriented internal
control that is apparently not being followed. The fact that
you have former employees or contractors staying on for some
period of time.
Mr. West. Yes, sir. With respect to employees, the
components all have programs for that that are different. The
Coast Guard is the fifth service, and they have a very DOD-
centric approach to that.
I believe that the biggest issue centers around
contractors. And as I said, contractors come and go with the
contract, and in fact, some time the same contract, different
people are swapped out for various, all kinds of reasons,
business reasons. And it is keeping track of contractors,
because they have access in some cases to our systems as well.
That is probably the biggest challenge. And frankly, the best I
can say, that is a challenge. Like I said, we need to get to
the point where we have strong token-based authentication so
that the system can do, in an automated way, can do the removal
as opposed to having to rely on a contracting officer to tell
the system administrator that this person has left. That has
just been a challenge.
And as I said, what we have put in place to mitigate that
are these periodic reviews. And at the Department level, we
have asked that we do that in as short a cycle as possible. It
is labor-intensive. There is a drain for that. Generally it is
90 days. That is kind of where we are with that. HSPD 12 gives
us a lot of promise, and we are, like I said, we are really
going after that.
Mr. Platts. And just given the information that you, as a
Department, hold within your data bases, a lot of very
sensitive information, all the more important that access be a
priority, and of those five major areas of weaknesses, that
that continue to be focused on. Technology ultimately could be
a wonderful solution. But in the meantime, whatever we need to
do to make sure from a manual standpoint. Because we don't want
to have it where it is always more of that Herculean effort to
comply. We want to get to it. But in the meantime, because of
the sensitivity of the information, whatever it takes is what
needs to be done.
Mr. West. Yes, sir.
Mr. Platts. The financial system functionality issues, Mr.
McCoy, you identify in your testimony about the example with
ICE and the issue of duplicate payments. As a subcommittee, we
focused on improper payments in a significant way. And the
numbers are staggering, the official number, $125 billion in
the most recent year available of improper payments. All sorts,
including duplicate payments. And you reference in your
testimony duplicate payments by ICE in fiscal years 2009, 2010,
and 2011.
Is there a ball park of what type, from a financial dollar
standpoint that we are talking about there, the significance of
those types of duplicate payments?
Mr. McCoy. Yes, sir, I have the number for 2011, but I do
not have the numbers, I can get those, for 2009 and 2010. For
2011, the duplicate payments occurred on January 28th, and it
was approximately $1.5 million.
Mr. Platts. And what type of contract, or do you have those
details with you?
Mr. McCoy. I believe it was a vendor payment and it was
scheduled multiple times. So multiple payments went to that
vendor.
Mr. Platts. All for $1.5 million?
Mr. McCoy. All for $1.5 million went to one vendor. ICE is
in the process, if they have not already recouped it all, will
recoup it either through offsets or the money has been
returned.
Mr. Platts. So $1.5 million was the amount of the payment
and it was made multiple times?
Mr. McCoy. The $1.5 million was the total amount. It was
multiple payments.
Mr. Platts. Okay. So it might have been a $500,000 that was
actually owed, paid three times, something of that nature?
Mr. McCoy. I believe it is more along the lines of $80,000
paid multiple times or something different. It is a smaller
number, it was paid multiple times.
Mr. Platts. The dollar amount being smaller may actually
make me even more concerned. Because if it was $750,000 and we
duplicate paid it once, that would be troubling and a risk to
taxpayers. But if it was $100,000 and we did it 15 times, then
that tells we have a real breakdown in the internal controls.
Mr. McCoy. It is part of the functionality with that
system. They have put a patch in to prevent that from happening
again. It also has something to do with training, with
certified officials.
Mr. Platts. Ms. Sherry, is that one that you are familiar
with, that case?
Ms. Sherry. Yes, absolutely. In fact, since 2009, I believe
ICE has had three separate duplicate payments that have been
both a mixture of manual errors, as Mr. McCoy had indicated, as
well as system issues. I think that the number is about $15
million in total over the last 3 years. And that is in context
of about $26 billion that they would have paid during that
time. So relatively small percentage-wise, clearly something
that is very concerning to us.
As we identify these issues, again, the goal in any of
this, any payment management controls, is to prevent that type
of stuff. So clearly, relying on detective controls is not a
best practice. That is not something that we want to do. But
when ICE had identified these duplicate payments, and typically
what would happen is on a particular schedule, when they go to
make the payment, it has a myriad of individuals on that
particular schedule. So what happens is when you pay it once,
and then if you are allowed to pay it again, I believe either
through a systems bug or a patch that didn't quite work, or the
system allows certifiers to maybe, schedulers to certify the
same schedule twice. Things of that nature, what ends up
happening is you end up paying all those individuals again, and
that is what is indicated then.
We worked very closely with ICE, clearly, for the last 3
years, to really identify the reason for the duplicate payment.
Because what we really wanted to find out, number one, we
wanted to prevent it from happening again. They detected it,
how do we prevent if from happening again. They have
successfully put in fixes for each of those. I believe in
November they will be putting in a fix to the Oracle data
server in order to be able to address any of the interface
issues which I think contributed to this last duplicate
payment. So we aggressively go after the fix of these.
ICE also is very much making sure that they are forward
looking. So in other words, if there is a particular schedule
that is paid that is out of the ordinary, maybe it is expedited
or it is not paid on their normal schedule, they are
hypersensitive in really reviewing those, just to make sure
that nothing abnormal actually happened.
Mr. Platts. That focus, I appreciate the point that $15
million out of $26 billion percentage, but $15 million of
American taxpayers' hard-earned dollars is still $15 million.
Ms. Sherry. I completely agree, sir, and we did recoup all
the payments. So we aggressively go after them to make sure
that we recoup them. And the Department has other programs in
place, such as the improper payments. And doing recovery
auditing, really using those forensics to go out there to
determine whether or not there are duplicate payments out
there, what we find happily through those forensic type looks
is that duplicate payments is not really rampant throughout the
Department. So it is not just at ICE.
But what we want to do is again, we have to prevent them as
opposed to just detecting them after the fact. Again,
protecting the American taxpayer dollar is what we need to do.
So one of the things that we will be doing this year, through
the A123 process, is really that end to end review of our
payment processes throughout the Department. And really
training, we need to be able to make sure that if an improper
payment is occurring because of a particular condition, we make
sure that we don't just fix it at that one component, but
instead, that all the components are addressing those
particular issues.
Mr. Platts. And I commend that approach. I think that has
been a hallmark of your leadership at the Department. It really
isn't just a one-time short fix, but a permanent solution. And
getting to root causes that we are putting in place and what we
have learned at ICE, let's make sure at FEMA or Coast Guard or
wherever that we are not having to repeat the error to reinvent
the wheel. Let's be comprehensive. I think that ultimately gets
to where I know where you are trying to get, ultimately, to
that clean audit in the long term.
I am going to put in one more question and then we are
going to have to wrap it up. That goes to the issue of the
financial systems modernization. And back in March, with the
cancellation of the transformation and systems consolidation
approach, more of an enterprise-wide and then just last month,
the announcement by the Under Secretary of the decentralized
approach. I guess if I could have kind of a summary of where we
stand on that change and that new approach, decentralized.
And Mr. McCoy referenced in his testimony that in making
the change to a decentralized approach that there would be
prioritized system modernization for components with the most
critical need. What is going to be the approach of that
prioritization? Is it going to be from a sensitivity of the
information? Dollar amounts that maybe are at risk? The history
of that entity, ICE versus FEMA versus, if you look at FEMA
with the number of repeat deficiencies, how are you going to
prioritize in making this new approach decentralized?
Ms. Sherry. Yes, sir. As you correctly point out, in March
we had the sustainment of the protest. What we have done, what
GAO had asked us to do was to really take a look at whether or
not our requirements had changed. So what we did is we took
that to heart and we took a look. We realized because of the
changes that have really occurred since we originally went out
with the solicitation, in particular in information technology,
that in fact we were able to do this differently.
So rather than bringing one system, one instance of a
system within our data warehouse, within our data centers, that
there was just a change in the security posture in general and
change in IT as it relates to cloud computing. In addition to
the fiscal pressures and the realization that you can't have
10-year implementation, where it takes you 10 years, $10
billion later, to be able to get to initial operating
capability.
So it has been something that our leadership has been very
much focusing on, not just for financial systems, but for all
of our IT projects, to be able to say, you need to be able to
get to operating capability quicker. What they are really
looking for, challenging us to be able to develop projects in
smaller ways such that we can develop that capability quicker.
So that is really what the intention is.
So all of that together, really, the Department looked back
and said, yes, there is a different way for us to be able to do
this. We haven't exactly said that FEMA will go here, Coast
Guard will go here, ICE will go here. Instead, what we are
doing, we are working with each of those components and having
them do an analysis of alternatives. They are doing their
market research, they are looking what is out there, they are
defining what their requirements are with the Department. What
we are doing is we are setting forward kind of the standards.
In the event that you were to be able to go out to a shared
service provider or a commercial provider out in the cloud some
place, here are the basic minimum internal controls you
absolutely must have, the things that you must do.
So we are working with the components in setting those
particular standards. Also working with them on common data
structures, such that we won't be overly proscriptive to be
able to limit their ability to be able to go out there and find
the right provider. But really the basics, such that in one of
our components, in their accounting line, they don't have a
budget year. So they don't have a budget year, which again,
that causes so many problems, so many audit problems as well as
workarounds and reconciliations. For my purposes, it causes me
great concern from a funds control standpoint.
So the basic chocolate and vanilla type standards that you
must have out there, you have to have a budget year in your
accounting line. So we worked very closely with them on that.
We want to focus on those systems that are most critical,
and they are critical for many fronts. What we are not doing is
waiting until we modernize the systems to address those
security issues. So the access controls, those key controls for
security, we are working with them on that. Instead what we
will do is look at those components that have, that basically
are almost in extremis with their systems. FEMA in particular
will be one that we had focused on initially for TASC that we
were going to move forward with. We are moving forward very
aggressively with FEMA right now as well to be able to replace
their system.
Working with the Coast Guard, I believe we will not be able
to get a full scope audit done very effectively and efficiently
without the Coast Guard doing something to their accounting
system. And as we have talked about this morning, ICE, with
their system issues as well as lack of integration, really is
something that we need to address.
Mr. Platts. The approach, and with the Department setting
minimum standards, is there a relationship as you are working
to do that between you and the CIO but also the IG in a
prospective, proactive way, versus after the fact that you go
this route and then IG and then internal and outside audits
says, no, that is not going to work? How does that relationship
proceed?
Ms. Sherry. That is a great question, because it is
something, one of the lessons learned as we have done TASC,
which really is that we need to involve all of the key
stakeholders, including the components, very early. But in
particular, we need to involve the OIG as well as the GAO in
really taking a look at them.
So as part of, with the Department being on the high risk
as it relates to many of these issues, financial management
being one of them, we work very closely with the GAO. In fact,
we briefed them just a few weeks ago on what this approach was.
We took some recommendations from them. We also met with the IG
just recently and gave them actually our data standards, here
is the standardization that we are trying to do and we have
invited both the GAO as well as the IG to provide comments to
us on that.
We will continue to share our documentation with them as we
develop it. We are working on a concept of operations currently
at the Department level, and then we work very closely with the
components. So right now, we are working closely with FEMA as
they develop their documentation and invite the IG in as well
as the GAO to be able to help us with best practices, so that
we can again look at that, not looking back and reading it in
an audit report, but really trying to prevent these types of
problems.
Mr. Platts. And again, that approach I think is very
commendable and ultimately what is going to help you succeed.
As Mr. Towns well stated earlier, our role is trying to partner
with you as you make that progress and go forward. And as the
Deputy Secretary said, if you need help in banging some heads,
we are glad to bring in any component entity before us to talk
about what they are doing, if they are not in line with what
you are trying to do as a Department. And again, not to play
gotcha, but just to make sure they understand the importance
that we all need to work together to get this done.
And your reference to the approach I think is very
important that, I think for the American people, it is hard for
them to understand that when the Federal Government says, we
have identified this problem and it is going to be 2 or 3 or 4
or 5 or 10 years before we think we will fix is, in the private
sector, the business would be closed and out of business.
Because of the role Government plays, it will still be one and
still just kind of doing its best while it is trying to fix the
problem. The American people, I think understand, they approach
it, what can we do and get it done, the sooner the better. And
especially here, protecting tax dollars and sensitive
information, so all the more important.
With that, we are going to need to wrap up. I want to thank
each of you again for your testimony, your knowledge that you
share as we try to fulfill our responsibility as an oversight
subcommittee and look forward to continuing to work with you.
The 2011 audit will be coming out and hopefully set a stage
here seeing some good news in just a few weeks.
We will keep the record open for 7 days, if there is any
additional information. I think I am good n the 2009 and 2010
with the numbers you shared. For 2011, I don't need that
additional information.
Also I do want to thank Mr. West and Mr. McCoy, in addition
to your work in your current positions, your prior service in
uniform. I am very grateful. I love what I do, but what I do
pales in comparison to you as a former Navy aviator and U.S.
Marine. I should say former, not former, you are always a
Marine, just no longer actively serving as a Marine. I am
grateful for both of your service and collectively all three in
your civilian positions, what you are doing on behalf of our
country and our citizens.
So with that, this hearing stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:22 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
