Chairman Broun. Subcommittee on Investigations and
Oversight will come to order.
Good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate everybody's
patience. We just had votes on the Floor, so I appreciate you
all's patience to the beginning of this hearing.
I want to welcome you all to the hearing entitled, ``NASA
Cybersecurity: An Examination of the Agency's Information
Security.'' You will find in front of you packets containing
our witness panel's testimony, their biographies, and truth in
testimony disclosures. I want to welcome our witnesses here
today.
I am going to begin by recognizing myself for five minutes
for an opening statement.
The topic of cybersecurity is certainly hot these days. As
Washington debates the government's appropriate role in private
sector cybersecurity activities, we should remember that the
government is already responsible for securing its own networks
and information, a task that is executed with mixed successes.
While the defense and intelligence communities take great
steps to protect data and operations from theft and corruption,
oftentimes civil agencies are not as vigilant. In many
instances this is for good reason. Transparency, coordination,
and collaboration are core values of an effective government,
particularly as it involves scientific agencies.
Openness, however, does not come without risk. Many of the
technologies developed and utilized by NASA are just as useful
for military purposes as they are for civilian space
applications. While our Nation's defense and intelligence
communities guard their front door and prevent network
intrusions, they could steal or corrupt sensitive information.
NASA could essentially become an unlocked back door without
persistent vigilance.
Information security concerns at NASA are not limited to
non-proliferation. There is a serious economic competitiveness
aspect as well. The loss or theft of NASA technologies could
compromise U.S. innovation and curtail significant future
commercial activities that bolster our economy. In order to
ensure that NASA does not become the weak underbelly that
allows enemies and competitors to access sensitive
technologies, we have to make sure that NASA has the necessary
authorities to protect that information.
The NASA Office of the Inspector General has monitored the
agency's cybersecurity for over a decade, issuing dozens of
reports and recommendations. To NASA's credit, they have taken
action to address these recommendations in a timely fashion by
clarifying the role of the Headquarters Chief Information
Officer, realigning the agency's other CIOs under that office,
setting up the security operations center or SOC, and improving
integration and visibility. Despite this progress, the threat
to NASA's information security is persistent and ever changing.
Unless NASA is able to continuously innovate and adapt, their
data, systems, and operations will continue to be endangered.
These are not simply bureaucratic matters that have no real
world impact or theoretical possibilities with little chance of
occurring. As the Inspector General points out in his
testimony, NASA has experienced 5,408 computer security
incidents in 2010 and 2011. That is a bunch. These intrusions
resulted in the installation of malicious software or
unauthorized access which caused significant disruptions to
mission operations, the theft of export-controlled data, and
technologies, and cost the agency more than $7 million.
Just last year the theft of an encrypted NASA laptop
resulted in the loss of algorithms used to command and control
the International Space Station. Similarly, the U.S. China
Economic and Security Review Commission recently noted in its
annual report to Congress that the Terra and Landsat-7
satellites have, ``have each experienced at least two separate
instances of interference apparently consistent with cyber
activities against their command and control systems.''
The fact that NASA is a high-profile target should come as
no surprise. What is astonishing, however, is the fact that
they are such a big target. NASA manages approximately 3,400
individual websites. For context, there are approximately 4,000
websites throughout the rest of the government. Simply
surveying this attack profile is a challenge, but defending it
presents even more difficulties.
Adding to this complexity are differing security profiles
for NASA's Centers, Mission Directorates, and institutional
capabilities. Despite the challenge, it is still imperative
that NASA conduct a thorough agency-wide risk assessment and
develop a corresponding mitigation strategy in a timely fashion
as recommended by the NASA IG last March.
I look forward to our witnesses' testimony and hope that we
can all work together to ensure that our Nation's space agency
can securely support and appropriately protect cutting edge
research, collaborative science, and mission operations.

Chairman Broun. Now I recognize Ranking Member Tonko from
New York for his opening statement for five minutes.
Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to our two
witnesses, to our Chief Information Officer Cureton, and to our
Inspector General Martin. Thank you for joining us.
I want to thank you, Mr. Chair, for calling this hearing,
and again, extend a welcome to our two distinguished witnesses
this afternoon. Inspector General Martin has been getting high
marks for the work of his office, and Ms. Cureton should be
congratulated for being willing to take on a tough job that the
country needs to see done well.
Twice in 2008, on-earth observation satellite, and earth
observation satellite managed by NASA's Goddard Spaceflight
Center experienced several minutes of interference that
prevented NASA from communicating with the spacecraft. The
events were indicative of an international cyber attack, and
the techniques were used, and I quote, ``consistent with the
authoritative Chinese military writings,'' according to a
report by the U.S. China Economic and Security Review
Commission.
The report did not attribute the specific instances against
the NASA satellites to China, but the implications were clear.
NASA's spacecraft may be vulnerable to acts of cyber attack.
In both instances involving NASA's Terra Earth Observation
Satellite, the report concluded, and I quote, ``The responsible
party achieved all steps required to command the satellite but
did not issue commands.''
Cyber attacks against NASA are nothing new. Over the past
decade both American citizens and foreign nationals have
penetrated the agency's cyber defenses, installed malicious
software, and stolen scientific security and other data. These
threats have come from foreign nationals in China, Great
Britain, Italy, Nigeria, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and
Estonia. Just last month the Romanian national who had
allegedly hacked into a NASA computer server and posted
sensitive satellite data he acquired online was arrested by
Romanian officials. Last November the NASA Office of Inspector
General, along with the FBI, announced charges against six
Estonian nationals and one Russian national. They infected NASA
and other computers with malware that alerted the settings of
more than four million infected computers, sending internet
searches on them to specific websites, generating more than $14
million in fraudulent advertising fees for the cyber criminals.
The number of potential threats is expanding rapidly. A
recent Cisco System study found that there were an estimated
12.5 billion electronic devices capable of connecting to the
internet in 2010. This number will increase to approximately 25
billion in 2015, and an astounding 50 billion by 2020. Given
this continued expansion of the computer communications
networks, organizations such as NASA will face a digital
battlefield of constantly-evolving points of attack and new
efforts to exploit weaknesses.
The challenge in successfully addressing cybersecurity
issues is particularly difficult at NASA. NASA owns a little
less than a half of the United States Government's non-defense
websites. There are approximately 3,400 NASA-controlled
websites, and nearly 1,600 of these are linked to the outside
world. There are an estimated 176,000 individual IP addresses
assigned to NASA's IT systems and IT networks.
NASA also possesses more than 120,000 computer or related
devices located at its centers and facilities that are
connected to the agency's IT networks. This huge system of
nodes and networks presents enormous IT security challenges and
potential IT vulnerabilities to the agency.
Over the past two years NASA reported more than 5,400
computer security intrusions that resulted in the installation
of malicious software or unauthorized access to NASA's computer
systems. These cyber threats pose unique safety and security
concerns to NASA. NASA's IT systems control spacecraft,
including the Hubble Space Telescope and International Space
Station. They collect and process scientific data and contain
records on a wide array of technologically sophisticated
intellectual property. These are all attractive targets for
cyber attack.
Yet NASA cannot just take those systems off the internet to
make them secure because they connect its thousands of
scientists, engineers, and other employees around the country
to each other, and they connect NASA's human and information
resources to the rest of the world.
Unfortunately, NASA has a poor history of addressing
cybersecurity threats. Insufficient efforts have been made in
the past to take appropriate actions to confront and correct
internal agency deficiencies. For example, the IG has
reinvestigated cyber-related issues it had identified in prior
reports only to find the original weaknesses still uncorrected.
These failures over time have exacerbated the agency's
vulnerabilities. They certainly complicate efforts by the new
leadership at NASA to address cybersecurity quickly and
effectively. NASA's IG has found that the agency does not have
an IT security configuration baseline across the agency. In
other words, it is unclear what NASA's IT security is supposed
to look like because there is no diagram of what it does look
like.
In addition, the IG has found that the agency's
vulnerability management practices have drastically
underestimated the cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities
NASA faces, and the agency lacks a complete, up-to-date
inventory of all of its IT components.
Clearly it is easier to protect your home from a potential
intruder if you know how many doors you have and where they are
located. NASA does not appear to possess an accurate blueprint
of its own house's IT infrastructure. Without that NASA cannot
ensure that every potential gateway into the agency is
monitored and effectively protected.
My comments are not specifically directed at NASA's Office
of the Chief Information Officer or Ms. Cureton, NASA's Chief
Information Officer, who is testifying before us today. In
fact, I hope my statement makes clear that I believe the
problems with cybersecurity at NASA are many years in the
making, and Ms. Cureton has had limited time to set things
right.
I am also aware that the CIO at NASA has limited authority
to impose cybersecurity solutions across the entire NASA
enterprise of contractors, centers, and mission directorates.
There seems to be a gap between the scope of your
responsibility and the scope of your authority.
NASA's IT vulnerabilities must be identified and closed.
Speed is critical in this context. If there are institutional
or financial stumbling blocks that stand in the way of
completing these critical tasks, then I hope our witnesses will
provide constructive suggestions to address them. The committee
is prepared to work with NASA to help close these gaps. I
believe this is an important subject, and I look forward to
hearing from our witnesses.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Tonko follows:]

Prepared Statement of Subcommittee Ranking Member Paual D. Tonko

Thank you for calling this hearing Mr. Chairman, and I want to
extend a welcome to our two distinguished witnesses this morning.

Chairman Broun. Thank you, Mr. Tonko. If there are Members
who wish to submit additional opening statements, their
statements will be added to the record at this point.
Now at this time I would like to introduce our panel of
witnesses. Ms. Linda Cureton, the Chief Information Officer at
NASA, and the Honorable Paul K. Martin, the Inspector General
of NASA.
As our witnesses should know, spoken testimony is limited
to five minutes each, after which the Members of the Committee
will have five minutes each to ask questions. Your written
testimony will be included in the record of the hearing.
Now, it is the practice of this subcommittee to receive
testimony under oath. Do either of you have any objections to
taking the oath? Both indicated by saying ``no'' and shaking
their head side to side reflecting no. Let the record reflect
such.
If all of you would please stand and raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear or affirm to tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God? Thank you. You may be
seated. Let the record reflect that the witnesses participating
have taken the oath.
Now I recognize our first witness, Ms. Cureton. You have
five minutes.

TESTIMONY OF LINDA Y. CURETON,

CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER,

NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION

Ms. Cureton. Chairman Broun and Members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before
you to discuss the state of information technology security at
NASA.
Today NASA professionally plans, builds, and practices IT
security to ensure integrity, availability, and confidentiality
of NASA's critical data and IT assets. The challenge is to get
ahead and stay ahead of cyber attackers who tend to be well-
resourced, exhibit varying levels of sophistication, and are
highly motivated. The pace of technological changes such as
cloud computing, social networking, and mobile computing modify
the landscape and compound the cybersecurity challenges.
NASA's Information Resources Management Strategic Plan
outlines strategic goals and objectives to provide cost-
effective agency security that safeguards and protects
information and information systems. We are determined to
improve NASA's capability to predict, prevent, and effectively
contain potential IT security incidents. Our motivation is
driven by the need to protect mission information targeted by
nation states, cyber criminals, and hackers, predict rather
than react to cyber threats, and create an adaptive agency
security posture that supports increased interoperability,
mobility, and innovation.
NASA's Security Operation Center recorded and categorized
1,867 cybersecurity incidents in fiscal year 2011. Analysis of
those cyber incidents led to additional patching, vulnerability
management, communication, and user training and awareness.
Building a truly successful security program requires
independent evaluation and honest appraisal. The NASA Office of
Inspector General IT Audit Staff continuously and aggressively
review NASA's IT security program. Over the past several years
the OIG has conducted audits of NASA's IT systems,
applications, and IT practices. They identified
vulnerabilities, threats, and risks to NASA's IT
infrastructure. In their last semi-annual report to Congress
the OIG noted 37 open IT security audit recommendations,
calling for NASA to identify internet accessible computers on
mission networks, conduct security assessments of mission
networks, mitigate risks on mission networks, implement
continuous monitoring across the IT infrastructure, improve
vulnerability scanning, reduce network vulnerabilities, improve
asset management, improve configuration management, update
policies and procedures.
Sixteen of the OIG recommendations have been closed, and a
corrective action plan has been implemented to mitigate the
remaining open recommendations. NASA has accomplished the
following under the plan: Inventory IT devices and security
configurations agency wide, scanned for vulnerabilities on
internet-connected devices, remediated discovered deficiencies,
conducted third-party external assessments of NASA networks to
determine website vulnerabilities, introduced new technologies
to capture and contain cyber attacks, analyzed approximately
130,000 connected devices to assess vulnerabilities and
security patch status. Entered a two-year agreement with the
Department of Energy for penetration testing of mission
networks, conducted strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and
threat assessments to improve strategic alignment of enterprise
IT security services, standardized IT security incident
response procedures, and consolidated contracts to provide
streamlined IT service management and delivery through the IT
Infrastructure Integration Program, I3P.
Finally, NASA remains committed to continued improvement of
the IT security posture as the NASA IT Security Program is
transforming and maturing.
Thank you.

minutes.

TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE PAUL K. MARTIN,

INSPECTOR GENERAL, NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE
ADMINISTRATION

Mr. Martin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Broun,
Ranking Member Tonko, and Congressman, excuse me, Congresswoman
Adams, thank you for the opportunity to testify at today's
hearing about NASA's efforts to protect its information
technology resources.
As it has been pointed out, NASA's IT assets include more
than 550 information systems that control spacecraft, collect
and process scientific data, and enable NASA personnel to
collaborate with contractors, academics, and members of the
public around the world. NASA is a regular target of cyber
attacks, both because of the large size of its networks and
because those networks contain highly-sought after information.
Moreover, some NASA systems house sensitive information,
which, if lost or stolen, could result in significant financial
loss, adversely affect national security, or significantly
impair our Nation's technological advantage.
At the same time NASA's statutory mission to share its
scientific information presents heightened IT security
challenges because the agency's connectivity with outside
organizations provide cyber criminals with a larger target
compared to many other government agencies.
In 2010 and 2011, NASA reported 5,408 computer security
incidents that resulted in the installation of malicious
software on or unauthorized access to its systems. These
incidents ranged from individuals testing their hacking skills
to well-organized criminal enterprises seeking to exploit
NASA's systems for profit to intrusions that may have been
sponsored by foreign intelligence services. Taken together
these intrusions have affected thousands of NASA computers,
caused significant disruptions to mission operations, and
resulted in the theft of export controlled and otherwise
sensitive data.
The OIG devotes substantial resources to examining NASA's
efforts to protect its IT systems. Over the past five years we
have issued 21 audit reports containing 69 IT-related
recommendations. To date all but 18 have been closed.
In addition, the OIG has conducted more than 16
investigations of breaches of NASA's networks, several of which
have resulted in the arrest of individuals as has been pointed
out in the U.S., China, Great Britain, Italy, Nigeria, Romania,
Turkey, and Estonia.
My written statement discusses in detail five issues that
we believe constitute NASA's most pressing challenges in the
admittedly-difficult task of protecting the agency's IT
information from loss or theft. Briefly, these challenges are,
number one, lack of full awareness of agency-wide IT security
posture. NASA's IT assets generally fall into two categories;
institutional systems and networks that support administrative
functions such as budgeting and human resources and mission
systems that support the agency's aeronautics, science, and
space programs. While the CIO has the ability to implement
security programs for NASA's institutional systems, she cannot
fully account for or ensure that the agency's mission assets
comply with appropriate IT security policies.
Number two, shortcomings in implementing continuous
monitoring. NASA has not fully transitioned from its historic
snapshot approach for certifying the security of its IT systems
to an approach that relies on a more comprehensive program of
ongoing monitoring.
Number three, the slow pace of inscription. NASA has been
very slow to implement full-disk encryption on its notebook
computers and other mobile devices, exposing sensitive
information to unauthorized disclosure when these devices are
lost or stolen. OMB has reported a government-wide encryption
rate for these devices of 54 percent. In contrast, at the
beginning of this month only one percent of NASA's portable
devices have been encrypted.
Number four, the ability to combat sophisticated cyber
attacks. Increasingly, NASA has become a target of a
sophisticated form of cyber attack known as an advanced
persistent threat or APT. In fiscal year 2011, alone NASA
reported it was the victim of 47 such attacks with 13
successfully compromising agency systems.
And number five, transition to cloud computing. While cloud
computing promises significant cost savings, NASA must
carefully weigh potential risks such as loss or compromise of
its data posted on the cloud.
This concludes my remarks. I would be pleased to answer any
questions.

Chairman Broun. Thank you, Mr. Martin. You were dead on
exactly five minutes. I appreciate that, and Ms. Cureton, you
were great, too, so I appreciate you all's expediency in
getting through this process. I thank you all for your
testimony.
Reminding Committee Members that committee rules limit
Members' questions to five minutes per round of questions. I am
going to defer the normal chair's starting the round of
questions. I am going to recognize Ms. Adams because she has a
meeting to go to, so Ms. Adams, you are recognized for five
minutes.
Mrs. Adams. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Martin, you referenced in your testimony a 2010, audit
where you discovered only 24 percent of mission network
computer were monitored for critical software patches and only
62 percent were monitored for technical vulnerabilities.
Additionally, you mentioned that only one percent, again, of
NASA's portable devices and laptops are encrypted.
Is this negligence by the CIO's Office, or is there another
explanation as to why this is not being done?
Mr. Martin. I don't think it is negligence by the Office of
the CIO, and you can ask the CIO that question. However, it is
disturbing. Certainly the encryption rate of one percent is
very disturbing because as we have discussed here NASA's mobile
computing devices contain very sensitive information.
Mrs. Adams. Right, and your office discovered in December
of 2010 that NASA failed to properly sanitize excess Shuttle
computers and hard drives and that at least ten had been
released to the public with sensitive data on them.
Did you recover any of these improperly-released computers,
and what has NASA done to ensure this doesn't happen in the
future?
Mr. Martin. Again, our auditors during that actually were
able, during the conduct of an audit, and again, this was not a
criminal investigation but an audit, the auditors caught what
was supposed to have been a sanitized hard drive, and we
prevented that and gave it back to the agency. This was
troubling. There were inconsistent procedures at the four NASA
centers that we went to for sanitizing excess Shuttle
equipment, and this was very troubling.
Mrs. Adams. Ms. Cureton, according to the IG between April,
2009, and April, 2011, NASA reported 48 agency mobile computing
devices with sensitive data and even some including export
control and a third-party intellectual property on them stolen.
How many of these devices were encrypted, and have any of them
been recovered?
Ms. Cureton. I am sorry I don't have the specific details
about those devices, but one of the things that we have done is
work closely with our desktop service provider to make sure
that the devices such as the laptops and mobile devices have
the appropriate encryption.
I mentioned in my opening statement that we recently
awarded our IT Infrastructure Programs, I3P, and the key
critical contract and program that needed to do that was
awarded in December. We have developed a plan for accelerating
our encryption of devices, and we have prioritized encryption
of laptop and other mobile devices.
Mrs. Adams. How many of the 5,400 attacks against NASA in
the last two years have originated from those devices or
information that was available on those devices? Do you know?
Ms. Cureton. I don't have the exact number, but generally
most of the attacks are sourced through our websites and
vulnerabilities through there. With the large number of
websites that we do have it creates a large attack surface
where attackers can easily get in and exploit things if they
are not appropriately protected.
So our biggest risk is the websites, and the mobile devices
do not represent a significant amount of risk in terms of what
we have seen.
Mrs. Adams. Has NASA's relationships with contractors and
other third parties been affected by the lack of security by
what we are hearing today?
Ms. Cureton. Excuse me? Has it been effective or----
Mrs. Adams. Affected.
Ms. Cureton. We work closely with our industry partners. We
work through organizations like the American Council of
Technology, the Information Advisory Council, and another
organization called the Cyberspace Intelligence Association or
Cyber Fajitas and Margaritas, and we work through them so we
have a safe forum for exchanging information and getting
information flowing freely between industry partners about what
we can do to jointly protect our common threats.
Mrs. Adams. So you are in constant contact and conversation
with those contractors and third parties because I would think
they would be concerned about their information, intellectual
property being stolen.
Ms. Cureton. Yes, and also we are concerned about
vulnerabilities that we present to their networks and they
present to ours.
Mrs. Adams. Thank you. I yield back.
Chairman Broun. Thank you, Ms. Adams.
Now recognize Mr. Tonko for five minutes.
Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Martin, you have suggested that NASA may not gain full
control of its IT security problems until the CIO's Office has
the authority to ensure IT security policies are enforced
across the entire agency. Would you please expand on how the
CIO's authority is limited and why that raises hurdles to
effective cyber security?
Mr. Martin. Certainly. I am not sure we used the word
authority. I think the CIO under certainly the Clinger-Cohen
Act and NASA policies has the authority. She does not have the
operational control as I indicated in my opening remarks over
the mission networks at NASA, and frankly that is where we are
seeing the bulk of the attacks coming from are the mission
networks that are in the control of the mission directorates or
based at the centers. She doesn't control the funding for
those, and Linda can speak to that. She doesn't control the
funding, and as we have all seen in Washington, when you don't
control the funding, you have a difficult time getting folks'
full attention.
Mr. Tonko. Thank you, and Ms. Cureton, to illustrate the
limits of your authority, can you share with us just what
proportion of NASA's IT budget you directly control?
Ms. Cureton. The fiscal year 2013 requested level is at
approximately 1.4 billion. Of that I am allocated a portion of
that, and it is 152 million. That allocation is given to me by
another directorate, so I am going to get whatever I am
allocated from that directorate, and the rest of it is
controlled either by CIOs at centers, a relatively small
portion of it, and I will say that the center CIOs do report to
me, but their budgets report to their center directors. And
then the rest of the $1.4 billion budget is controlled by
missions and programs.
Mr. Tonko. Interesting. Ms. Cureton, if you were given more
authority over the IT budget and over the mission directorates,
how would you use that to enhance cybersecurity policies?
Ms. Cureton. I would attempt to consolidate many of our
networks. One of the challenges that we do have, especially as
it relates to the funding required to implement these
safeguards, there are many networks that need to be
safeguarded, many doors, many gates to guard. And there needs
to be a consolidation of the local area networks that exist at
the agency so that safeguarding these networks is a more
practical effort.
So I would definitely do that. I would prioritize on
addressing the vulnerabilities and risks that exist on our
networks and then finally address the proliferation of websites
to the extent that it makes it difficult for us to secure our
networks. There is a strong need for NASA to have networks and
internet technologies to collaborate and share information with
our partners, but in looking at some of the innovative
abilities, innovative solutions that exist now, there are more
modern ways to securely collaborate with partners and still
accomplish our mission.
Mr. Tonko. And that ought to be, I would think, a high
priority within the operations that you serve.
Ms. Cureton. Correct.
Mr. Tonko. Absent more authority, how can you assure us
that you can build a bulletproof cybersecurity program for
NASA?
Ms. Cureton. I am committed to work diligently with the
goals that I have set before the Administrator. I have a very
capable IT security staff, my deputy CIO for IT security. We
work closely as we can with missions. We work to build
credibility, to communicate, to improve user awareness. We
continue to do those things and continue to attempt to make
progress in breaking down some of the barriers while closing
some of the loopholes that we do have.
Mr. Tonko. Thank you, and Mr. Martin, do you believe
cybersecurity can be effectively established at NASA absent
consolidation of authority?
Mr. Martin. Even with consolidation of authority there
needs to be a new mindset and a new way to operate. Again,
having control solely over the IT security apparatus for just
the institutional side of the house is woefully inadequate to
securing NASA's very important information.
Mr. Tonko. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Chairman Broun. Thank you, Mr. Tonko. I yield myself five
minutes now.
Last March the NASA IG issued a report that called for NASA
to conduct an agency-wide IT risk assessment. In that report
the CIO committed to developing and implementing a strategy for
conducting this risk assessment by August 31, 2011.
First, Mr. Martin, what is the status of this effort, and
do you know of a firm date where we can expect that.
Mr. Martin. I think Ms. Cureton would probably know the
exact date.
Chairman Broun. I am going to ask her that next.
Mr. Martin. I believe the date of August, 2011, has
slipped, and NASA has asked until I believe November of this
year to complete that action.
Chairman Broun. Okay. Ms. Cureton. What is the status?
Ms. Cureton. Yes. The date has slipped, and we have made a
formal request for an extension.
Chairman Broun. When are we going to have the report, and I
mean, the risk assessment done and full accounting for what you
are doing to implement that?
Ms. Cureton. June, 2012.
Chairman Broun. Absolutely, positively June, 2012. We keep
slipping past these dates, and this committee would like to
know when we can expect that.
Ms. Cureton. I believe that I will make it. I am committed
to make that happen. I can't say that there are things that
won't happen that cause us to change our priorities, but it is
an absolute priority for me, and I am committed to make sure
that it happens.
Chairman Broun. Well, certainly we need to have a way to
implement this risk assessment. September of 2010 and December
of 2011 the NASA IG issued reports recommending that NASA
transition to a continuous monitoring approach for this IT
system.
Mr. Martin, what is the status of this effort?
Mr. Martin. It is ongoing. I think NASA has made some
significant strides. This is a whole new approach to monitoring
the security of government systems, and you may be familiar
with the FISMA, the Federal Information Security Management Act
of a number of years back.
Unfortunately, we have seen in the IG community it devolve
into really somewhat of a less effective paper-driven exercise.
And so there has been a move that has been promoted by OMB and
the Department of Homeland Security to move more toward what is
called continuous monitoring a more dynamic security oversight
process because the IT systems that you are reviewing are
dynamic and ever changing.
So we assess NASA's move from the old static, what we call
``snapshot'' system, once a year at this moment in time, do you
have the policies, do you have the paperwork, as opposed to,
``do those policies and paper mean anything, do they work,''
and moving to a continuous monitoring. NASA has made strides,
but as we point out in our audit report, we found a couple
significant areas where NASA needs to make significant efforts
in order to have an effective continuous monitoring program.
Chairman Broun. And you have made those recommendations to
NASA?
Mr. Martin. We absolutely have.
Chairman Broun. Okay. Ms. Cureton, do you want to answer
the question?
Ms. Cureton. We committed to completing the activities,
enable that in November, 2012. There are several steps that we
need to make, one of them will be to have a more robust asset
management program to have situational awareness of the
configuration of the networks and the endpoint devices, and we
believe that that should be essentially completed in the first
quarter fiscal year 2013.
Chairman Broun. And this is going to be a continuing
monitoring process?
Ms. Cureton. Yes.
Chairman Broun. Okay. In 2011, NASA developed a governance
model to streamline IT decision making. What role do the
mission directorate senior officials, the subject matter
experts that are responsible for mission success, play in the
IT security decision making process, Ms. Cureton?
Ms. Cureton. We have governance boards and working groups
that have representation from each mission directorate, and we
have enterprise architecture boards that have representations
from the mission directorates. Our IT management board has
representation from a mission directorate in terms of a mission
directorate CIO. At the senior levels there is a mission
support council that consists of myself, the assistant
associate administrator for mission support, the associate
administrator, the deputy associate administrator, and the CFO,
and then report to the executive council, which consists of the
administrator, the deputy administrator, and some of the others
that I mentioned earlier.
The representation from the directors and the centers would
come from the administrator, the deputy administrator, and also
through the associate administrator.
Chairman Broun. Okay. My time has expired.
I will now yield five minutes to Mr. Tonko.
Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
This is a question I will pose to both of our witnesses.
What do you see as the biggest IT security threat facing NASA
today? Would it be foreign governments, 16-year-old children in
the United States, cyber criminals, groups like anonymous--is
there any way for either of you to quantify the IT threats that
NASA faces and what the actual impact of these threats have
been to NASA?
Mr. Martin. After you.
Ms. Cureton. Thank you.
Mr. Martin. You are welcome.
Ms. Cureton. In saying big, big would be quantified as like
the largest number of attacks or perhaps it could be a smaller
number of attacks but a bigger impact. So it is hard to really
say what is big, but certainly the impact is the advanced
persistent threat in terms of what it means to our Nation's
security and our Nation's future.
But then big in terms of numbers tends to be more along the
criminal side because there is opportunities to get financial
information, personal identification from employees that could
financially benefit hackers. And probably by numbers some of
them appear like that, but by impact it is probably more along
the lines of the advanced persistent threat that is probably
attributable to nation states or organized crime.
Mr. Tonko. Uh-huh. Mr. Martin.
Mr. Martin. Thank you. I don't disagree with that
assessment at all, but we have seen the whole gamut. We have
seen the Swedish teenager bringing down NASA's super computer
at Ames causing upwards of $6 million in damage for
remediation. We have seen the criminal, sophisticated criminal
enterprises. As we mentioned, we had six arrests in Estonia
working with the Estonian National Police. That was primarily a
financially-derived initiative, but once you are in the NASA
systems, even if your goal is to redirect internet traffic, you
know, for what they called internet fraud, click fraud, or more
of an advertising scam, you have access into NASA's systems.
You can sell that access to other folks who are after NASA-
sensitive information.
So it really runs the gamut.
Mr. Tonko. Thank you, and all NASA IT components are
supposed to be identified in a database established by the
CIO's Office, all the IT security enterprise data warehouse.
The IG's audit found, I believe, that out of 289 NASA IT
components they reviewed only 175 that were included in that
database. The IG found that NASA's failure to maintain a
complete, up-to-date inventory of IT components significantly
diminishes its ability to develop and maintain a continuous
monitoring program.
Where do we take this from there?
Ms. Cureton. So the first step would be to increase the
number of assets that we do monitor, and that would be by
increasing and improving our asset management program, and once
we do that we are able to determine the configuration of those
assets and maintain the right inventory of baseline
configuration levels.
And then finally, make sure that we are able to monitor
each component of the network to look for intrusions and
identify them as soon as possible.
Mr. Tonko. Thank you, and many of the issues we are talking
about here today have been endemic at NASA for at least the
past decade. Can both of you please address that issue and tell
us why you believe these IT security issues at NASA continue to
occur, why it appears NASA management has had such a difficult
time reigning in these issues and managing its IT security
structure in a better format.
Ms. Cureton. Me first? Okay. The most difficult part of
addressing this is culture. We spend a lot of time focused in
the technology part of it, which is really difficult, too, but
culture is probably the number one impediment.
IT security is considered a CIO's problem, but IT security
is basically a mission problem. The information that the actors
are looking for is mission information. They are looking for
the information to get some advantage in terms of whatever the
motives they have would dictate.
And being more focused on the institutional side doesn't
really protect where the biggest risk is, but being able to
persuade the mission, the culture of the mission that they
should include a culture of looking at IT security issues is a
big challenge admittedly.
And so as with working through any culture, it takes a long
time to build the credibility to provide the impetus to change,
to get critical mass that says, yes, we are going to do it and
go forward, and so that process takes a long time, and it has
taken a long time.
Mr. Tonko. Anything?
Mr. Martin. I think I would agree with that. I think if the
goal is to have IT security at NASA more centralized in the
CIO's Office, she would need a much larger stick than she
currently has now.
Mr. Tonko. Thank you, and I have exceeded my time, so, Mr.
Chair, I yield back.
Chairman Broun. Thank you, Mr. Tonko. I yield myself five
minutes.
The ``Wall Street Journal'' article on November 17, 2011,
titled, ``China, U.S. Use Same Tracking Base,'' states that the
Chinese entity, China satellite launch and tracking control
general, part of PLA's General Armament Department, leases a
ground station in Dongara, Western Australia that is run by a
Swedish state-owned company called Swedish Space Corp SSC and a
U.S. subsidiary that supports U.S. Air Force space surveillance
satellites and NASA.
According to a spokesman for Australia's Department of
Innovation, Industry, Science, and Research, ``Australia did
not consult the U.S. on the establishment of the SSC facilities
or its customers.''
Ms. Cureton, what insight does NASA have into the
information security measures employed at foreign satellite
ground stations, and do these foreign sites have a
multinational presence present unique--do they present a unique
challenge to NASA IT security?
Ms. Cureton. Well, obviously we have to work within the
constraints of what state and local authorities are there, but
we do protect the nodes of our network that exist at foreign
locations. I can't speak specifically to the article that you
quote, but I will say that we do take the proper security
precautions at foreign locations.
Chairman Broun. That seems just to be kind of a roundabout
way of losing our security. I hope you all look at the presence
that these do present, because I think it does present a unique
challenge to your all's security.
The U.S. China Economic Security Review Commission issued
an annual report last November that indicated that the Terra
and Landsat-7 satellites experiences interference apparently
consistent with cyber activities against their command and
control systems.
Ms. Cureton, who is currently responsible for ensuring data
integrity and security for NASA satellite operations? Is it the
CIO or mission directorates?
Ms. Cureton. It is the mission directorates.
Chairman Broun. How do we make sure that they stay secure?
Do they stay there, or do we come back to your office or how
do--tell us what you would recommend?
Ms. Cureton. I believe that the mission directorates need
to own the responsibility of security for their assets. One of
the challenges is that I own the responsibility of securing
other people's assets, and I own the responsibility of making
them a priority according to somebody else's priority. So once
the responsibility of securing mission networks and assets in
this case properly resides with the proper management
authority, I think we would see better responses.
Chairman Broun. You would see some better responses across
the board as far as I am concerned.
What insight does the CIO have into contractor compliance
with NASA IT security standards, and who is responsible for
providing contractor information and security oversight, Ms.
Cureton?
Ms. Cureton. The responsibility would go to the owner of
the contract. So if it is in the mission directorate, that is
where it would be.
Chairman Broun. Okay. Mr. Martin, do you have any
suggestions or thoughts?
Mr. Martin. I think what we do is we audit and we
investigate. Because I think this is the fundamental issue
facing IT security at NASA: are we going to have a CIO's Office
and what structure would best implement a strong security
function at NASA, because we have discussed the limited
authority that she has over the institutional side of the house
as opposed to the mission side of the house.
So we have opened an audit that is going to look at the
governing structure that NASA currently employs in its CIO
Office, vis-`-vis its mission directorates to try to find where
that balance, where the best balance of authority and
responsibility would be.
Chairman Broun. When will that audit be available for us?
Mr. Martin. We have just begun it. I would think that we
are probably looking nine months down the road.
Chairman Broun. Well, please get it to us as quickly as you
get it. This committee is very interested in hearing that.
NASA has conflicting priorities when it comes to
information management. On one hand it has to protect sensitive
information associated with dual use, proprietary data from
release, but on the other hand it has to facilitate scientific
collaboration which requires open access and transparency.
Ms. Cureton, how does the CIO manage these competing
cultural priorities?
Ms. Cureton. One of the key enablers of this is with our
I3P Infrastructure Program. One of the contracts awarded was to
SAIC to manage networks. We have many networks at NASA. We have
wide area networks, and we have many, many local area networks.
So the network service provider will be moving through the
agency and assuming operational responsibility over existing
networks. That will take some work in terms of working with
mission directorates and looking at responsibilities where they
are separated and where they are joint. And then once we do
that then we are able to have an awareness of what is out
there.
Chairman Broun. Thank you, Ms. Cureton and Mr. Martin. I
thank you all for you all's testimonies today. This is a huge
issue. I see a tremendous vulnerability for a very sensitive
underbelly of our own economic security as well as potential
defense security through NASA. As I have stated before to both
of you all, cybersecurity is extremely important to me as an
individual, and I think it is important to Mr. Tonko and all of
us here on this committee.
I hope that we can find some way to make sure that we have
better cybersecurity, IT security within the Department, and I
am looking forward to working with both of you as we go forward
and helping to develop a better security infrastructure within
NASA. You all have been great.
The Members of this Subcommittee may have additional
questions for you all to answer, and we will ask you to respond
to those in writing. In fact, I have a number myself that I
will submit to you all, and I am sure all of us will probably
do so. The record will remain open for two weeks for additional
comments from Members.
The witnesses are excused. I thank you all very much, and
the hearing is now adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 3:21 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
