U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

``The Federal Perspective on a National

Critical Materials Strategy''

tuesday, june 14, 2011
2:00 p.m.--4:00 p.m.
2318 rayburn house office building

Purpose

On June 14, 2011, the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight
has invited officials from the Administration to discuss the federal
perspective on a national critical materials strategy. This includes
rare earth elements as well as other critical materials.

Background

A recent report by the American Physical Society (APS) and
Materials Research Society (MRS) defines energy critical elements (ECE)
as: ``a class of chemical elements that currently appear critical to
one or more new, energy-related technologies. A shortage of these
elements would significantly inhibit large-scale deployment, which
could otherwise be capable of transforming the way we produce,
transmit, store, or conserve energy.'' \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ ``Energy Critical Elements: Securing Materials for Emerging
Technologies,'' a report by the American Physical Society and the
Materials Research Society, February 2011, available at: http://
www.aps.org/policy/reports/popa-reports/loader.cfm?csModule=security/
getfile&PageID=236337 (hereinafter APS/MRS Report)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Located primarily around the center of the Periodic table (Appendix
2), there are several reasons why these elements may be considered
critical beyond the role they play in electronics and advanced
technologies such as electric cars, wind turbines and photovoltaic
cells. The joint APS and MRS study explains elements may be critical
because they might be ``intrinsically rare in Earth's crust, poorly
concentrated by natural processes, or currently unavailable in the
United States.'' \2\ While many energy critical elements also play
important roles in national defense, this hearing is primarily focused
on the commercial and energy applications of these materials.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Within the definition of energy critical elements are a group of
seventeen chemical elements that are commonly found together, and
referred to as the rare earth elements. On the Periodic table, fifteen
of these elements are located in the Lanthanide series (see below),
which make up a row of elements with atomic numbers in ascending order
from 57 to 71. The other two are Yttrium (atomic number 39) and
Scandium (atomic number 21). A list of the rare earth elements below,
and their common end uses, is available in Appendix 3.

Rare earths share similar--yet unique--chemical and physical
properties that make them critical components of advanced technologies
such as high powered magnets, petroleum refining catalysts, batteries,
and lasers among others. Like other critical elements, rare earths are
important components of everyday items such as cell phones,
blackberries, hybrid cars, etc.
Rare earths are further classified into two categories--light and
heavy. The lighter elements--basically the first half of the Lanthanide
series--are more abundant and have a larger market. The heavier
elements--the second half of the Lanthanide series--are scarcer, but
equally, if not more critical, even with a smaller market share.
Despite the terminology, rare earths are actually abundant in the
Earth's crust. They are however, expensive and difficult to mine, as
the process of separating and isolating each individual rare earth
element is highly complex and cumbersome--both financially as well as
logistically. When initially extracted from the ground as an ore, rare
earths are mixed together. The mixed rare earths have to be chemically
extracted from the ore concentrates, and further chemically separated
from any other metals that exist in the ore. The remaining mix of rare
earths then undergoes an additional process to isolate each individual
rare earth in a ``separation plant.'' \3\ These are expensive
facilities to build, and can ``easily involve hundreds of repetitive
steps taking up to a month to finish a single batch of material, and
although batches can be run almost continuously the size of the plant
must reflect the optimum large batch size for producing enough volume
to make a profit, by selling the resulting commercially pure separated
chemical compounds.'' \4\

International Production

China
From the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States was the dominant
producer in the world of rare earths. But the intensive nature of rare
earths mining ultimately led to the demise of this industry. The
process of mining and separating rare earth elements presents
environmental challenges. It creates ``hundreds of gallons of salty
wastewater per minute, consuming huge amounts of electricity, requiring
toxic materials for the refining process and occasionally unearthing
dirt that is radioactive.'' \5\ Combined with China's lower
environmental standards, labor costs, and government backing of an
industry of interest to that nation, the U.S. couldn't remain
competitive, and ultimately ceded authority of this industry to the
Chinese. The result is that today, China produces about 97% of the
world's rare earth oxides--demonstrating the success of a vision
eloquently encapsulated in the following 1992 quote by Deng Xiaoping,
the architect of China's economic transformation, ``There is oil in the
Middle East; there is rare earth in China.'' \6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
But as China's interest in the industry has expanded, so too has
its control. Since 2006, ``the Chinese Commerce Ministry has been
reducing export quotas, as well as limiting and cutting the number of
firms that are allowed to export rare earths in their raw form. In
2006, 47 Chinese companies had permits to export rare earths, but by
2010, only 22 companies were allowed to do so.'' \7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understandably, with a reduction in permits has come a reduction in
exports. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ``Last year, China
slashed exports by 72%, and then by another 35% for the first half of
2011.'' \8\

Future,'' ChamberPost, April 19, 2011, available at: http://

future/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moreover, as of 2007, China has established export taxes on rare
earths. ``Originally set at between 15 percent to 25 percent, depending
on the oxide or concentrate being exported, the rates on many more rare
earth products are expected to be raised by 25 percent in 2011.'' \9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ Ting Article, supra, note 7
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
China claims these measures are necessary to protect its
environment from rogue mining operators, and to sustain its rare earths
industry. To that end, China issued guidelines earlier this year that
lifts rare earth elements to the level of national strategic reserves.
Additionally, existing mines are forbidden from expanding capacity,
China is setting up a strategic stockpile system for rare earth metals,
and it aims to concentrate 80 percent of the country's heavy rare earth
mining assets in the hands of its three largest companies over the next
couple of years. \10\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
China's actions have created tense relations with American
technology and renewable energy industries, leading the U.S. Trade
Representative's office to say that ``if China continues to rebuff
requests to ease export limits on rare earths, it may take the dispute
to the World Trade Organization.'' \11\ And, an analyst at the Heritage
Foundation had the following to say:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ Hsu Article, supra, note 5

``Beijing already faces a losing case at the World Trade
Organization (WTO) for its rare earth export quotas. A Chinese embargo
would take at least a few months to have an effect and would trigger
WTO sanctioned retaliation that would match or exceed the dollar value
of rare earth exports. Trade disruptions from that point would harm the
PRC far more than the U.S., given the much greater volume of Chinese
shipments to America and the jobs associated with them.'' \12\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Japan

China's willingness to take advantage of its near monopoly on rare
earth elements isn't restricted to export quotas and taxes, nor are its
policies directed solely to the United States. While China is the
world's largest producer of rare earth elements, Japan conducts a great
deal of the world's rare earth processing, and is therefore vulnerable
to Chinese export restrictions. Last year, China suspended exports of
rare earths to Japan in retaliation for Japan's detention of a Chinese
fishing boat captain accused of deliberately ramming two Japanese
patrol boats in disputed waters. \13\ While Japan kept custody of the
fisherman during its investigation, the Chinese government kept raising
diplomatic stakes in demanding his freedom, leading to an increasingly
tense stand-off between the two nations. Japan eventually relented, and
let the Chinese captain go, claiming that the negative impact on the
Japan-China relationship wasn't worth the cost. China, meanwhile,
denied any embargo on rare earth shipments to Japan--even though it
took almost two months before shipment of the minerals resumed. \14\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Australia
Prior to the Japanese incident, in 2009, China sought to expand its
influence in other countries. Flush with the cash flow of a bustling
economy, the Chinese made multiple unsuccessful bids to purchase
significant shares of several companies in Australia's resource
industry:

A $400 million bid for a controlling stake in a rare
earths miner fell through;

For national security reasons, Australia's Defense
Department intervened in a proposed joint venture between an Australian
subsidiary of a Chinese company and an Australian outback mining
venture;

In a separate deal, again for national security reasons,
Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan rejected Minmetals' (a Chinese state-
owned firm) $2.6 billion offer for OZ Minerals;

A $19.5 billion discussion between Chinese-owned metals
firm Chinalco and Rio Tinto broke down after Rio backed away from the
deal; and

China Nonferrous Metal Mining (Group) Company ended
negotiations to purchase Lynas Corporation because Australia's Foreign
Investment Review Board required the Chinese company's ownership stake
to be below 50% while maintaining a minority of board seats on Lynas.
\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\15\ Rob Taylor, ``China Drops Lynas Bid; Further Strains
Australia-China Relations,'' Mineweb, September 24, 2009, available at:
http://mineweb.com/mineweb/view/mineweb/en/
page72068?oid=89761&sn=Detail

The Lynas negotiation attracted a great deal of attention given the
leverage the Chinese would have had in a company that owns significant
deposits of undeveloped rare earths. Had China been successful in this
endeavor, it would have further tilted the playing field in its favor,
despite the 97 percent control it already enjoys in the production of
rare earth oxides.

Domestic Production

The combination of China's aggressive actions--strong-arming Japan,
aggressive purchase bids in Australia, reducing the number of rare
earth export permits and quotas, and increasing taxes on these
exports--has prompted numerous countries to call for a more diversified
rare earths market and greater domestic exploration and production. As
China's economy and industry grows, its own need for these rare earth
materials is increasing. Because of this, it is possible that China
could cease rare earth exports, or become a rare earth importer at some
point in the future.
These circumstances have led to a renewed interest in domestic
production of rare earth elements. Although ``[r]are earth element
reserves and resources are found in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Missouri,
Utah, and Wyoming . . . [t]here is no rare earth mine production in the
United States.'' \16\ The company best positioned to reconstitute
domestic production is Molycorp Minerals, LLC. Based in Colorado, the
company owns a mine in Mountain Pass, California, a site that once
allowed Molycorp to hold the title of largest producer of rare earths
in the world. But the mine shut down in 2002, as a result of low priced
Chinese imports, strict environment regulations in the U.S., and
liabilities associated with environmental contamination. \17\
Nevertheless, proving its value, China has attempted to buy the mine
three times after it shut down in 2002. \18\

\18\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In his testimony before this Subcommittee last year, Mark Smith,
Molycorp's Chief Executive Officer, outlined the company's approach
toward restarting the mine, and establishing itself as a competitive
business. According to Mr. Smith:

Many industry observers question how a U.S. producer of rare
earths can ever compete with the Chinese, when the possibility always
lingers that the Chinese could flood the market and dramatically
depress rare earth prices, a practice they have demonstrated
previously. We have spent the better part of the past eight years
developing the answer to this question. We changed the orientation of
our thinking and discovered that by focusing principally on energy and
resource efficiency, we could make major improvements in our cost
competitiveness while at the same time advance our environmental
stewardship.

We will incorporate a wide variety of manufacturing processes
that are new to the rare earth industry, which will increase resource
efficiency, improve environmental performance, and reduce carbon
emissions. Specifically:

Our overall processing improvements will almost cut in
half the amount of raw ore needed to produce the same amount of rare
earth oxides that we have produced historically. This effectively
doubles the life of the ore body and further minimizes the mine's
footprint;

Our extraction improvements will increase the
processing facility's rare earth recovery rates to 95% (up from 60-65%)
and decrease the amount of reagents needed by over 30%;

Our reagent recycling, through proprietary technology
that Molycorp has developed, could lead to even greater decreases in
reagent use;

Our new water recycling and treatment processes reduce
the mine's fresh water usage from 850 gallons per minute (gpm) to 30
gpm--a 96% reduction;

Finally, the construction of a Combined Heat and Power
(CHP) plant--fueled by natural gas--will eliminate usage of fuel oil
and propane. This will significantly reduce the facility's carbon
emissions, reduce electricity costs by 50%, and improve electricity
reliability.

These process improvements fundamentally reverse the conventional
wisdom that superior environmental stewardship increases production
costs. At the same time, we significantly distinguish ourselves from
the Chinese rare earth industry that has been plagued by a history of
significant environmental degradation, one that it is just beginning to
recognize and rectify. \19\

March 16, 2010 (hereinafter Smith Testimony)

From a financial perspective, Molycorp's efforts are receiving
favorable marks thus far. By the end of last year. \20\ Molycorp
claimed it had secured all the permits it needed to begin mining ore
this year. Molycorp is spending over $500 million on its 2,200-acre
facility, and by 2014, plans to dig about 40,000 tons of dirt a year,
compared to its current 3,000 tons. \21\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moreover, as part of its `mine-to-magnets' strategy, Molycorp and
Hitachi Metals Ltd. agreed to ``form a joint venture to produce rare-
earth alloys and magnets, moving Molycorp a step closer to establishing
a rare-earth manufacturing chain in the U.S.'' \22\ This deal would
expand Molycorp's business beyond just mining. Hitachi owns a host of
patents on neodymium iron boron (NdFeB) permanent magnets, which
advances Molycorp's `mine-to-magnets' strategy. These powerful magnets
have played an essential role in miniaturizing consumer electronics
(cell phones), and are key components of lightweight, high-power motors
and generators (wind turbines, hybrid and electric vehicles.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
From Japan's perspective, where Hitachi is based, this venture
would provide the country with some place other than China for a supply
of rare earths. Separately, Molycorp also struck a deal with Sumitomo
Corporation, another Japanese company, which ``agreed to buy $100
million, or more than 3%, of Molycorp's shares and provide $30 million
in financing as part of a seven-year rare-earth supply agreement.''

Interagency Working Group

Since March 2010, OSTP, in coordination with the National Economic
Council and the National Security Council, has been hosting an
interagency working group on critical and strategic mineral supply
chains, which includes the topic of supply constraints on rare earth
elements. The group is initially focusing on four areas:

Defining, screening and prioritizing critical materials;

Prioritizing federal research and development;

Review of domestic and global policies that affect the
supply of critical and strategic minerals (e.g., permitting, export
restrictions, recycling, stockpiling, etc.) and consideration of
methods to mitigate risks through industrial or diplomatic processes;
and

Transparency of resource supply and demand information.

Participants in this group include: Department of Energy,
Department of Defense, U.S. Geological Survey, Department of Commerce,
Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Justice, Department of
State, and the U.S. Trade Representative.
At this time, there are no plans to develop a collaborative report
or document to reflect the dialogue and/or exchange of ideas between
the participating agencies.
Last December, DOE officials published the ``Critical Materials
Strategy'' report, and indicated that they plan to release an update at
the end of this year. The 2010 report examined the role of rare earths
and other materials in the clean energy economy. In the report, DOE
describes plans to:

i.  develop its first integrated research agenda addressing
critical materials;

ii.  strengthen its capacity for information-gathering on this
topic; and

iii.  work closely with international partners, including Japan and
Europe, to reduce vulnerability to supply disruptions and address
critical material needs. \24\

\24\ Critical Materials Strategy, U.S. Department of Energy,
December 15, 2010, available at: http://www.energy.gov/news/documents/
criticalmaterialsstrategy.pdf (hereinafter DOE Report)

With respect to its critical materials strategy, the DOE report
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
identifies three points:

First, diversified global supply chains are essential;

Second, substitutes must be developed;

Third, recycling, reuse and more efficient use could
significantly lower world demand for newly extracted materials. \25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\25\ Ibid.

The follow-up report ``will include additional analysis of rapidly-
changing market conditions. It will analyze the use of critical
materials in other technologies, such as fluid cracking catalysts in
petroleum refineries. Finally, the updated strategy will identify
specific steps forward for substitution, recycling and more efficient
use of materials identified as critical.'' \26\ There is a need for
data on recycling efforts by industry, as well as understanding the
potential for substitute materials. Stories such as Toyota's plans to
switch from rare earths to a special induction motor in its Prius, \27\
and GE's success in developing a new alloy to replace Rhenium, a
critical material in its turbine engines, are encouraging. \28\

It would also be beneficial to Congress and private industry if the
Administration would address the issue of mining permits. Highlighting
the seriousness of this subject, during testimony before a House
Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources hearing
on May 24, Mr. Hal Quinn, President and CEO of the National Mining
Association, made the following observation:

``Regulatory costs can slowly drown an enterprise. But the
uncertainties and delays in obtaining permits to commence operations
can crush the mining enterprise before it even gets in the dirt. Permit
delays pose the highest hurdle for domestic mining with necessary
government authorizations now taking close to ten years to secure. If
commodity cycles are historically 20 years in duration, the ten-years
it takes to obtain permits leaves U.S. mining still in the starting
blocks with the race half way over.'' \29\

Funding Streams

Funding for rare earths and critical materials R&D is spread
throughout several DOE programs, making it difficult to isolate
specific budget numbers. The following is a list of programs and sub-
programs from which funds may be used relative to rare earths and
critical materials projects: Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable
Energy; Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy; Industrial
Technologies Program; Next Generation Materials Program; Next
Generation Manufacturing Processes; Manufacturing Energy Systems
Program; Energy Efficiency Partnership; and Industrial Technical
Assistance Program.
Additionally, the USGS Mineral Resources Program supports funding
for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of minerals information

Statutory History

Thirty years ago, the National Materials and Minerals Policy,
Research and Development Act was enacted because:

. . . [T]he United States lacks a coherent national materials
policy and a coordinated program to assure the availability of
materials critical for national economic well-being, national defense,
and industrial production, including interstate commerce and foreign
trade . . . \30\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\30\ 30 USC 1601(a) (6)

The Congress declared it the President's responsibility to
coordinate a plan of research and other actions that would ``.promote
an adequate and stable supply of materials necessary to maintain
national security, economic well-being and industrial production with
appropriate attention to a long-term balance between resource
production, energy use, a healthy environment, natural resources
conservation, and social needs.'' \31\ Our current situation with rare
earth minerals indicates that successive Administrations failed to
carry out this policy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\31\ 30 USC 1602
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 1980 Act directed development of a plan that would, among other
outcomes, produce continuing assessments of demand for minerals and
materials in the economy; conduct a ``vigorous'' research and
development effort; collect, analyze and disseminate information; and
cooperate with the private sector and other nations. \32\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\32\ 30 USC 1603
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Four years later, dissatisfied with the inaction to the 1980 law,
Congress decided in the National Critical Materials Act of 1984 to
establish a National Critical Materials Council in the Executive Office
of the President to serve as the focal point for critical materials
policy. The Council was tasked to assist the President in carrying out
the requirements of the 1980 Act. \33\ In 1993, through Executive Order
12881, \34\ the National Critical Materials Council was terminated, and
its responsibilities transferred to the National Science and Technology
Council, located within the Office of Science and Technology Policy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\33\ 30 USC Chapter 30
\34\ Ex. Ord. 12881, ``Establishment of the National Science and
Technology Council,'' November 23, 1993; 58 Fed. Reg. 62491. Dr.
Gibbons tied the reorganization both to President Clinton's decision to
reduce staff within the White House and to the National Performance
Review conducted by Vice President Gore. Bill Loveless, ``Gibbons to
Propose Formation of Science and Tech Council,'' Federal Technology
Report, September 2, 1993; p. 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 1995 and 1996, the NSTC published reports on the Federal
Research and Development Program in Materials Science and Technology.
No equivalent report has been produced since, however, nor has OSTP
produced the ``long-range assessments of materials needs related to
scientific and technological concerns'' or ``scientific and technical
changes over the next five years'' whose annual preparation the statute
requires. \35\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\35\ 30 USC 1604(b) (2) and (3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Somewhere along the way, there appears to have been a failure in
communication between the two branches of government given that
multiple Administrations have disregarded responsibilities assigned by
Congress in the 1980 Act.
During its hearing on rare earths last March, this Subcommittee
revisited policy issues it thought had been settled decades ago to
determine how to avoid finding ourselves in similar straits in the
future. The full Committee on Science and Technology even held a mark-
up in September on H.R. 6160, the Rare Earths and Critical Materials
Revitalization Act of 2010, introduced by Rep. Kathleen Dahlkemper a
day before the mark-up. Among its provisions, Rep. Dahlkemper's bill
repealed the National Critical Materials Act of 1984, and amended parts
of the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development
Act of 1980. On September 29, the House approved the bill by a vote of
325-98.
This year, a number of Members have introduced legislation
regarding rare earths and critical materials, with at least two of them
repealing the 1984 Act. (See Appendix 1.)

Issues

R&D Portfolio
The federal government funds a number of research and development
programs related to rare earths and critical materials. Recent reports
recommend establishing research and development efforts focused on
geological deposit modeling, mineral extraction and processing,
material characterization and substitution, manufacturing, recycling,
and life-cycle analysis. The private sector has a strong incentive to
conduct this research as well; however, its focus is primarily on
applied research rather than basic or fundamental research. In times of
fiscal austerity, some have suggested prioritizing research and
development activities in such a manner that precludes duplication, and
prevents the crowding-out of private sector work. In other words, the
federal government should not only identify what research needs to be
conducted to enhance the critical element supply chain, but also what
research is actually appropriate for government support versus private
sector investment.
Information
Another recommendation for the U.S. government involves improving
information related to discovered and potential resources, production,
use, trade, disposal, and recycling. Currently, USGS provides the
majority of data on element and mineral supplies; however, the agency
has very little information on current and future demands. DOE projects
the potential demand for energy critical elements, but not for all
applications. In order to gather, analyze, and disseminate information
on both supply and demand, reports have recommended that a ``Principal
Statistical Agency'' should be tasked with regularly surveying emerging
technologies and the supply chain throughout the Periodic table, with
an aim of identifying critical applications, as well as potential
shortfalls.
Loan Guarantees
A number of federal incentives were proposed to address shortfalls
in domestic rare earth element production, most notably loan
guarantees. Because access to capital was limited after the financial
downturn, potential rare earth producers applied for DOE loan
guarantees, and several legislative proposals sought to expand similar
programs for rare earth elements. Despite the limited access to
capital, concerns have been raised about the necessity of such
incentives, given the high demand for rare earth elements.
Stockpiling
Recent proposals direct the federal government to stockpile certain
rare earth elements and critical materials, especially those vital to
national security and defense. The Defense National Stockpile maintains
and manages strategic and critical materials, but proposals have
suggested similar non-defense stockpiling efforts in addition to this
effort. Conversely, other proposals have suggested that stockpiling is
not necessary for non-defense related purposes other than helium.
Permitting
Arguments have been made for a streamlined permitting process for
miners of rare earths and critical materials, as it can take as long as
ten years to obtain the necessary approval. Any effort to revitalize a
domestic rare earth industry that can compete with China is contingent
upon minimizing administrative burdens. Ensuring that the permitting
process is expedited in a manner that respects public health and
safety, and the environment, is key to the industry's long term
viability.

APPENDIX 4

Rare Earth Elements and Critical Material Funding

Department of Energy

The following information is from Chapter 4 of DOE's 2010 ``Critical
Materials Strategy'' report:

Several U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) data and information
programs, research and development (R&D) programs and financial
instruments address rare earths and other key materials. Current
programs focus on the component and end-use technology stages of the
supply chain and address both the economic and the innovation
dimensions of the clean energy sector.

DOE also supports R&D addressing specific materials and
alternatives across the supply chain. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2010, the
Office of Science, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy
(EERE) and the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E)
together provided approximately $15 million for research on rare earth
materials and possible substitutes for magnets. An additional $35
million was spent by ARPA-E on next generation battery technologies
that don't require rare earths.

At the basic science end of the pipeline, the Materials Sciences
and Engineering (MSE) Division of the Office of Basic Energy Sciences
supports broad-based, fundamental materials research. MSE seeks to
illuminate the atomic basis of materials properties and behavior and
improve materials performance at acceptable costs through innovative
design, synthesis and processing. This research was funded at a level
of about $5 million/year in FY 2010.

Most of the supported work has been performed at Ames Laboratory.
A key component of the Ames Laboratory program is the Materials
Preparation Center (MPC). The MPC was established in 1981 to provide
high purity metals (including the rare earths, uranium, thorium,
vanadium, chromium); and intermetallics, refractory, inorganic
compounds and specialty alloys; none of which are available
commercially in the required purity or form/shape needed by the
requestor on a cost recovery basis.

Moving along the pipeline to applied research via feasibility
research, technology development and demonstration, ARPA-E supports two
initial projects totaling $6.6 million specifically targeted to
developing substitutes for rare earth magnets. The goal of this $4.4
million project is to develop materials to allow the United States to
fabricate the next generation of permanent magnets (PMs) with magnetic
energy density (maximum energy product) up to two times higher than the
current value of the strongest commercially available neodymium-iron-
boron (Nd-Fe-B) magnets. If successful, this project will lead to
cheaper, more energy-efficient, more power-dense magnets for deployment
in a wide range of clean energy technologies.

In another ARPA-E project, General Electric Global Research (GE)
is developing next-generation permanent magnets with a lower content of
critical rare earth materials. For the $2.2 million project, GE is
developing bulk nanostructured magnetic materials with a dramatic
increase in performance relative to state-of-the-art magnets. These new
magnets will increase the efficiency and power density of electric
machines while decreasing dependence on rare earth minerals.

Addressing the challenge of rare-earth and critical-materials-
containing batteries, particularly in the emerging hybrid and electric
vehicle transportation sectors, the Batteries for Electric Energy
Storage in Transportation (BEEST) program invested $35 million in
first-of-kind demonstration of new batteries and storage chemistries,
structures and technologies.

The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) is
supporting an applied magnet research project valued at $2 million (FY
2010) at Ames Laboratory. This project is focused on fabricating high-
performance, cost-effective PMs that can be used for traction motors
with an internal PM rotor design.

In addition to the magnet material research, EERE's Vehicle
Technologies Program supports two projects valued at a total of $1.4
million (FY2010) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory investigating
alternative motor designs that do not use rare earth PMs.

In addition, in 2009, the Vehicle Technologies Program awarded
$9.5 million to Toxco, to expand an existing battery recycling facility
in Ohio and become the first U.S. facility to recycle lithium-ion
vehicle batteries.

For wind power applications, reducing magnet size by developing
higher flux density magnets is more important than consistent
properties at elevated temperatures. EERE's Wind and Water Technologies
Program is supporting QM Power, Inc., with to develop a higher flux
density PM generator. There are also much larger investments within
EERE in battery, PV and lighting R&D that have key materials use
implications.

The Loan Guarantee Program (LGP) was established under Title XVII
of the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005. The LGP is authorized to
provide loan guarantees to support domestic manufacturing of component
technologies that use critical materials if those technologies meet the
statutory tests. Projects supported by the program have the potential
to affect market demand for key materials.

The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan
Program provides loans to automobile and automobile part manufacturers
to re-equip, expand or establish manufacturing facilities in the United
States to produce advanced technology vehicles or qualified components,
and for the associated engineering integration costs. Vehicles with
efficiency standards that will contribute to a clean energy economy are
included in the definition of advanced technology vehicles. The ATVM
lacks authority to directly support extraction and production of key
materials. However, the ATVM issued loans to companies for projects
that may affect the market demand of nickel metal hydride (NiMH) or
Lithium ion batteries and NdFeB permanent magnet motors. These
companies include Ford Motor Company ($5.9 billion), Nissan North
America ($1.6 billion), Tesla Motors ($465 million) and Fisker
Automotive ($529 million). \38\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\38\ DOE Report, supra, note 24

Since this report was published, there have been two notable additions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
according to DOE congressional affairs staff:

ARPA-E issued a $30 million funding announcement for
projects on rare earth alternatives in green technologies being funded
out of the FY 2011 appropriations; and

A $20 million request to create a critical materials
innovation hub in the FY 2012 appropriations request.

US Geological Survey

According to USGS congressional liaison office, USGS' FY 2012 request
of $44.2 million for its Mineral Resources Program represents ``about
an 18 percent reduction from the FY 2010 enacted level of $53.8
million. As a result, [USGS] will eliminate collection, analysis, and
dissemination of minerals information for about 180 other countries;
domestic minerals information activities will continue. This is the
information that goes into the Mineral Commodity Summaries and Volume
III-Area Report: International, of the Minerals Yearbook. In addition,
[USGS] will eliminate mineral resources research and field studies in
Alaska and will eliminate about 50 scientific and technical positions
[out of a total of about 350] across the United States.''
Mr. Hultgren. The Subcommittee on Investigations and
Oversight will come to order. Good afternoon. Welcome to
today's hearing titled ``The Federal Perspective on a National
Critical Materials Strategy.'' Chairman Broun is unable to
attend due to a family emergency, so I am sitting in for him
today. You will find in front of you packets containing our
witness panel's written testimony, biographies, and Truth-in-
Testimony disclosure.
I recognize myself for five minutes for an opening
statement.
The subject of today's hearing is one which this
Subcommittee is very familiar with. A little over a year ago,
under the then-Democratic majority, the Investigations and
Oversight Subcommittee held a hearing on rare earth minerals.
Rare earths, as most of you know, possess unique physical and
chemical properties that make them particularly suitable for
use in advanced technologies such as high-powered magnets,
petroleum refining catalysts, batteries, and lasers, among
others. They are also important components in everyday items
that everyone in this room probably has right now, such as cell
phones and Blackberrys.
This Committee did some very good work last year as we
heard from industry folks, academics, and scientists. Today, we
follow up on that work and take the next step in this process
by hearing from government officials.
I am pleased to welcome our distinguished guests. While
they represent different agencies within the Administration,
they are here today because of their collaboration on an
interagency working group on critical and strategic materials
supply chains.
Critical materials include rare earth elements which are
more widely recognized today than they were when this Committee
last addressed this topic. That the issue is still of interest
to Congress is evident by the number and variety of bills
introduced in both the House and the Senate. I myself recently
introduced H.R. 2090, the Energy Critical Elements Advancement
Act, and Mr. Miller from the Democratic side has a bill also.
In 1980, the National Materials and Minerals Policy,
Research and Development Act was enacted because the United
States lacked a coherent national materials policy and a
coordinated program to assure the availability of materials
critical for our national economic well being, national
defense, and industrial production, including interstate
commerce and foreign trade. Thirty-one years later, this
Committee is presented with similar issues and, to quote Yogi
Berra, ``it's deja vu all over again.''
Our witnesses today will provide us with some insight into
the Administration's perspective on critical materials. Dr.
Holdren will discuss the activities of the interagency working
group that was created last year. Mr. Sandalow and Mr. Doebrich
will discuss their respective agencies' involvement in the
group, as well as provide us with an overview of their
agencies' responsibilities relative to the topic of this
hearing.
Taking it a step further, I look forward to some honest
conversations about appropriate roles that should and shouldn't
be played by the Federal Government. While I appreciate the
need for federal research, I believe we should distinguish
between basic and applied research, recognizing that the
government may have a role to play in the former, but that it
should not duplicate nor preempt work that is rightfully done
by industries.
For about 2 decades, the price of rare earths and critical
materials were low, perhaps artificially so, because of Chinese
policies. As a result of these policies and our own stringent
rules regarding environmental standards, U.S. suppliers were
unable to compete. Now that the Chinese have restricted
exports, prices have gone up because non-Chinese suppliers have
all but vanished. These policies have led to various
international trade protests that remain unresolved.
Conversely, there are those who say that we shouldn't fret
over these conditions because the financial markets will
ultimately correct the situation. The expansion of Lynas
Corporation in Australia and the growth of Molycorp in the
United States provide hope that alternatives to Chinese rare
earths will be available shortly. In the interim, though, we
still need a plan, one that should assess issues such as
stockpiling, permitting, researching and development, workforce
development, recycling, information gathering, and
manufacturing and production incentives. I look forward to
exploring these options and hearing from our government
witnesses today.
The Chair now recognizes Ms. Edwards for an opening
statement.

conversations about appropriate roles that should--and shouldn't--be
played by the federal government. While I appreciate the need for
federal research, I believe we should distinguish between basic and
applied research, recognizing that the government may have a role to
play in the former, but that it should not duplicate, nor preempt work
that rightfully should be done by industries.
For about two decades, the price of rare earths and critical
materials were low, perhaps artificially so, because of Chinese
policies. As a result of these policies, and our own stringent rules
regarding environmental standards, U.S. suppliers were unable to
compete. Now that the Chinese have restricted exports, prices have gone
up because non-Chinese suppliers have all but vanished. These policies
have led to various international trade protests that remain
unresolved.
Conversely, there are those who say that we shouldn't fret over
these conditions because the financial markets will ultimately correct
the situation. The expansion of Lynas Corporation in Australia, and the
growth of Molycorp in the United States, provides hope that
alternatives to Chinese rare earths will be available shortly.
In the interim though, we still need a plan, one that should assess
issues such as: stockpiling, permitting, research and development,
workforce development, recycling, information gathering, and
manufacturing and production incentives. I look forward to exploring
these options, and hearing from our government witnesses today.
I now turn to the Ranking Member from Maryland.

Ms. Edwards. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you in
advance to our witnesses today. I want to thank the Chairman
for taking up this important issue. And I also want to
acknowledge the work of the former Chairman of the
Subcommittee, Mr. Miller, who held the first hearing on this
matter for the Committee and who also worked with his then-vice
chair, Kathy Dahlkemper from Pennsylvania, to craft legislation
designed to help address the shortage of rare earth elements.
Rare earths are just one class of materials that are
crucial to our economy and our national security. This
Committee has a 30-year-long history of trying to establish an
ongoing institutionalized focus on potential shortages of such
materials, but at different times, both Republican and
Democratic administrations have let this matter slip off the
table. That said, I congratulate the Obama Administration for
grasping the challenge of critical materials and organizing to
develop a coherent set of policies. I am very pleased to see
Dr. Holdren here today to talk about those efforts.
The public focus on shortages is largely on rare earth
elements, but tomorrow, the challenge may indeed be scarce
isotopes or metals or minerals. I think we need to recognize
that government should have an ongoing capacity to work to
identify potential shortages and adopt policies designed to
avoid or diminish the disruptions that come with shortages.
Some argue that rare earth element--that the rare earth element
story will end up validating the power of markets to address
demand. It is true that there are aggressive efforts underway
in Malaysia, the United States, and other places to develop
rare earth extraction capacity. However, even if those efforts
prove fruitful, the reality is that China's aggressive use of
access to their rare earth reserves will have succeeded in
moving manufacturing facilities and jobs to China. Once there,
those facilities are highly unlikely to move away.
Further, there is nothing to keep China from reversing its
rare earth policies if they face competitors. At the moment,
China has cut export quotas to create incentives for farms to
move there and to capture exorbitant profits from those
reserves they do export. There is nothing to stop the Chinese
Government from reversing course in the future and flooding
markets with rare earths to drive their competition out of
business. And when faced with a state-controlled economy the
size of China's, we cannot assume that markets alone can solve
our problems.
I want to warn that those who blame our loss of mining and
rare earths on environmental regulations that they are
overlooking the reality that the key lever the Chinese use to
win a virtual global monopoly in mining in the first place was
cutthroat pricing. That said, rare earth mining and processing
has proven to be a very dirty business in the past with
pollution, including radioactive waste, a trademark of this
industry. I expected our work to develop a domestic industry
that will not ignore the real dangers inherent in earth mining
and process and that we will see Molycorp and others set a
global standard for environmental compliance and safety.
I look forward to the testimony today and hope that this
marks the beginning of an ongoing dialogue about how to protect
our jobs, our economy, and our national security for unfair
trade practices and resource scarcities.
I would like to yield my remaining time to my distinguished
colleague, Mr. Miller of North Carolina.

Mr. Miller. Thank you, Ms. Edwards.
Ensuring reliable and stable supply of energy-critical
elements is obviously vital to our national security and our
economic interest, and this has been an issue of interest to me
for some time. As both Ms. Edwards and Mr. Hultgren have said,
I chaired a Committee hearing--a Subcommittee hearing on this a
year ago. As a result of that hearing, this Subcommittee did
develop legislation. Our Democratic staff did great work. Ms.
Dahlkemper, who was the vice chair of the Committee introduced
the legislation, and I have introduced that--very similar
legislation again that is based upon the work of the
Subcommittee last year.
But that really was not the first legislation of this kind.
We are not new to this issue. We recognize the importance of
critical materials in the '80s and past National Materials and
Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act. I say ``we''--I
mean Congress, but obviously I was not here then. But Executive
Branch efforts really have been nonexistent for almost two
decades now. It is time that we do start focusing on the issue.
We cannot allow ourselves to lose the competitive advantage
that we have had in the past or have those materials--access to
those materials used to leverage other economic advantages. And
I look forward to working with the Office of Science and
Technology Policy, the Department of Energy, and I am glad that
they are paying attention to this issue as well.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Hultgren. Thank you, Ms. Edwards and Mr. Miller. If
there are members who wish to submit additional opening
statements, your statements will be added to the record at this
point.
At this time, I would like to introduce our panel of
witnesses: first, Dr. John Holdren, Director of the Office of
Science and Technology Policy; next, Mr. David Sandalow is the
Assistant Secretary for Policy and International Affairs at the
U.S. Department of Energy; and Mr. Jeff Doebrich is the Acting
Program Coordinator for the Mineral Resources Program at the
U.S. Geological Survey. Thank you all for being here.
As our witnesses should know, spoken testimony is limited
to five minutes each, after which the members of the Committee
will have five minutes each to ask questions. Your written
testimony will be included in the record of the hearing.
It is the practice of the Subcommittee on Investigations
and Oversight to receive testimony under oath. Do any of you
have any objection to taking an oath? Let the record reflect
that all witnesses were willing to take an oath.
You may also be represented by counsel. Do any of you have
counsel here with you today? Let the record reflect that none
of the witnesses have counsel.
If all of you would now please stand and raise your right
hand.
Do you solemnly swear or affirm to tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you, God?
Let the record reflect that all the witnesses participating
have taken the oath. Thank you very much. You may be seated.
I now recognize our first witness, Dr. Holdren. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN P. HOLDREN, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF

SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY POLICY, EXECUTIVE OFFICE

OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

Dr. Holdren. Well, Chairman Hultgren, Ranking Member
Edwards, members of the Subcommittee, I want to start by
thanking you for the opportunity to testify today on
administration policies and interagency efforts for addressing
the issues that surround the production and use of critical
materials.
There is, as you have already mentioned, a number of you, a
long history of concerns about the availability of critical
materials, which we call that because their supply is highly
concentrated in either one country or in a few corporate
entities, and because they are used in the production of goods
that are important economically or for national security.
The Executive Office of the President in this
Administration has been focused on this issue for well over a
year--since March 2010, in fact. The Office of Science and
Technology Policy in close coordination with the National
Economic Council, the U.S. Trade Representative, and the
National Security Council has been convening--as you mentioned,
Mr. Chairman--an interagency working group to develop the
necessary understanding of the critical materials situation and
to focus Administration thinking and resources on risk
mitigation.
Four points have emerged from that process as key to
understanding the overall situation. The first one is that
concentrated production does not necessarily mean the reserves
are equally concentrated. China currently accounts for about 95
percent of world production of the rare earth elements but is
host to only a third to a half of the known reserves. In
situations of that kind, market forces will work over the long
term to mitigate risks as other suppliers come into the market
to take advantage of higher prices and new demand.
Second point is that market size does not necessarily
predict disruptive potential. For example, the U.S. market for
raw oxide forms of rare earths is small. It is only about $170
million a year or about 1/1000 of a percent of U.S. GDP. But
these rare earths serve as vital ingredients in many advanced
technologies in the commercial and defense domains, including
the emerging clean energy sector, which are worth much more.
Third, the risks of supply disruptions depend on what form
of the material is deemed critical: raw minerals, metals,
alloys, components, or finished goods. For any given material,
a detailed analysis of the entire supply chain is necessary in
order to identify where the vulnerabilities are and to identify
effective mitigation measures.
Fourth, in the short term, the Administration can use trade
relations and diplomacy to foster the diversification of supply
of critical materials, as well as taking steps to facilitate
domestic production. In the long term, the greatest
opportunities to reduce the risks associated with critical
materials are through investments in research and innovation.
In the rest of my time, I want to elaborate on some agency
and interagency activities that are currently underway and
contemplated to address those issues. First of all, it is
important to identify proactively and continuously which
materials are critical based on an agreed-upon set of criteria.
A number of departments, agencies, and outside entities,
including the National Academy of Sciences, have been and are
conducting such analyses and developing frameworks that will
ultimately allow us to anticipate material shortfalls before
they actually happen in the market.
Second, given the growing interdependence among countries
supplying and using these resources, a shared and accurate
understanding of global raw material flows, location of
resources, and material demand is essential. The OSTP convened
interagency process is investigating the best ways to
accomplish that.
Third, USTR is closely examining China's policies,
restricting exports of raw materials including rare earths, and
continues to press China to remove those restrictions both
through bilateral dialogues and through international venues.
Fourth, and for the longer term, the Administration
proposes to initiate additional research activity on critical
materials issues. The President's fiscal year 2012 budget
includes $20 million for a DOE innovation hub in that domain,
and I suspect that Assistant Secretary Sandalow will describe
that hub and other relevant DOE R&D activities in more detail.
In closing, let me emphasize that the Obama Administration
is taking the topic of critical materials and their supply
chains very seriously indeed. Federal agency efforts are being
coordinated through the White House-led interagency process as
I mentioned. We remain in close communication with the
scientific, technical, and business communities, and certainly
we look forward to working with this Subcommittee, with the
full Committee, and with other Members of Congress to improve
our national capabilities in this domain.
I will be happy to try to answer any questions you have.
Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Holdren follows:]

Prepared Statement of Dr. John P. Holdren, Director, Office of Science
and Technology Policy, Executive Office of the President of the United
States
Chairman Broun, Ranking Member Edwards, and members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the
Administration policies and interagency efforts for addressing the many
complex issues associated with the production and use of critical
materials.
While recent events may have precipitated this hearing, there is a
long history of concerns over the availability of critical materials.
Many materials are referred to as ``critical'' because supply is highly
concentrated in either one country or by a few corporate interests, and
because they are used in the production of goods that are important
economically or for national security. Today, there is particular
concern about materials like platinum, tellurium, and rare earth
elements because they are essential to the manufacture of products in
key high-growth sectors, including clean energy, consumer electronics,
and defense, among others.
The Executive Office of the President (EOP) has been focused on
this issue for some time. Since March 2010, the Office of Science and
Technology Policy (OSTP), in close coordination with the National
Economic Council (NEC), the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative
(USTR), and the National Security Council (NSC), has been convening an
interagency working group to develop the necessary understanding of the
critical-materials situation and to focus Administration thinking and
resources on risk mitigation. First, I would like to go through some
key themes that have emerged as part of this interagency process-themes
that will provide the necessary backdrop for our discussion today. Then
I will turn my attention to administration action areas already under
way.

Production is only indicative of short-term market risk

Concentrated production does not necessarily imply concentrated
reserves. China currently accounts for about 95 percent of world
production of the rare earth elements (REE), but is host to only a
third to half of known reserves. The high concentration of current
production creates short-term risks and vulnerabilities, such as high
commodity prices and supply disruptions, but in the longer term normal
market forces will work to mitigate these risks, as other suppliers
come into the market to take advantage of the higher prices and new
demand.

Access to critical materials is vital for emerging industries,

like clean energy

The U.S. market for the raw oxide form of REE is small-only about
12 percent of global trade, or $170 million per year. But these REE
serve as vital ingredients in many advanced technologies in both the
commercial domain (including electric vehicles, lighting, computers,
wind turbines, ceramics, and medical imaging) and the defense domain
(including avionics, radar, precision-guided munitions, and lasers).
Supply shortages of critical materials are of concern because they can
stall production of high-growth industries such as the emerging clean
energy sector.

In assessing risks of supply disruptions, the entire supply chain

must be considered

The risks of supply disruptions depend on what form of the material
is deemed critical-raw minerals, metals, alloys, components, or
finished goods. For example, most electronic components and finished
goods containing rare earths are manufactured abroad, so there is
probably little cause for concern in the domestic electronics industry
if only the raw metals and oxides are being restricted, so long as the
U.S. companies can continue to buy the REE-containing components and
goods from other countries. In another example, the United States has
the largest reserves of tellurium, a materials used in high-efficiency
solar technologies, and there is a high level of producer diversity of
this material. However, global production of tellurium has not
increased with growing global demand, potentially limiting the market
development of promising new photovoltaic technologies. For any given
material, a detailed analysis of the entire supply chain is necessary
to identify potential vulnerabilities and effective mitigation
measures. In some cases, domestic manufacturing is as important as
domestic mining.

Long-term planning and innovation provide the best opportunity to

mitigate supply risks

Concentration of the production of critical materials can cause
painful price spikes and supply disruptions. In the short term, the
Administration can use trade relations and diplomacy to foster the
diversification of critical material supply, as well as take steps to
facilitate domestic production. In the long term, the greatest
opportunities to reduce the risks associated with critical materials
are through investments in R&D and innovation. The OSTP-convened
interagency process is addressing these core themes in both the short
and long-term. Presently this interagency effort is organized around
the following sets of activities:

identifying critical materials based on common and agreed
criteria;

promoting more detailed and transparent collection of
information on global resource supply and demand to facilitate the
proper functioning of markets;

establishing federal research and development priorities
and establishing R&D roadmaps; and

reviewing-in coordination with our colleagues in the NEC,
USTR, NSC and Federal agencies-domestic and global policies that affect
the supply of critical materials (permitting, export restrictions,
recycling, stockpiling, etc.) and pursuing remedies for roadblocks.

In what follows, I elaborate on the agency and interagency
activities currently underway and contemplated in each of these
domains.

Identifying critical materials based on agreed criteria

Identifying which materials are critical based on an agreed set of
criteria should be done proactively and continuously. The National
Academy of Sciences and the American Physical Society/ Materials
Research Society recently published reports that include methodologies
for defining critical minerals. In its 2010 Critical Materials
Strategy, the Department of Energy (DOE) developed a methodology for
assessing energy-critical materials. Concurrently, the Department of
Defense (DOD) is conducting a congressionally mandated assessment of
demand for individual rare earth elements from defense applications
with an interim report due in July 2011. In support of this effort, the
USGS recently completed a DOD-funded inventory of known domestic rare-
earth reserves and resources. These analyses and frameworks provide the
foundation for developing a robust and on-going analytical capability,
one that allows the Federal government to anticipate material
shortfalls in multiple civilian and defense related sectors long before
they happen in the market. Our newly established interagency working
group formed a sub-group co-chaired by the Departments of Energy and
Defense to perform this task.

Depth and transparency of information

The growing interdependence between countries supplying and using
raw materials underlines the importance of ensuring that global markets
are open and well-functioning, on the basis of known material flows,
clear price signals, and fair and transparent regulations. A shared and
accurate understanding of global raw materials flows, location of
resources, and material demand is essential to ensure the smooth
functioning of materials markets. Data availability for many critical
raw materials is limited due to relatively small market sizes and a
limited number of producers. In addition, assessing the supply and
demand outlook is complicated because many critical raw materials are
mined or coproduced with other materials. More accurate and timely
market information will help industry and governments make better
strategic decisions. The OSTP-convened interagency process can support
the collection, dissemination, and quality assurance of global
information that builds on existing government data-collection
processes. For example, enhanced cooperation among national geological
services could substantially improve collective knowledge on the
availability of raw materials and facilitate the identification of
resource location.

Federal R&D needs and priorities

The Department of Energy is initiating new R&D activity on these
issues. The President's FY 2012 Budget includes a proposal for a DOE
Energy Innovation Hub ($20 million) on critical materials to help
reduce U.S. reliance on materials such as rare earth elements (REE).
The Hub activity will focus on finding ways to reduce the content of
such critical materials in existing components; identifying new
chemical compositions, material designs, and approaches that are not
reliant on critical materials; and pursuing technologies that decrease
the cost of separating critical elements from recycle streams and ores.
Furthermore, DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E)
issued a solicitation in FY 2011 to fund early-stage technology
alternatives that reduce or eliminate dependence on rare earths by
developing substitutes in two key areas: electric vehicle motors and
wind generators. Up to $30 million will be made available for this
program area.

Addressing global trade policies

In October 2010, USTR initiated an investigation into allegations
concerning China's export restraints on REE, tungsten, and antimony,
pursuant to a petition brought by the United Steelworkers under Section
301 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. Although no formal action was
taken by USTR under Section 301 on the REE allegations, USTR is closely
examining China's policies restricting exports of raw materials,
including REE, and continues to press China to remove its export
restraints on REE and other raw materials. Moreover, the United States
is actively working through international organizations such as the
World Trade Organization (WTO), the G-20, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), and through bilateral dialogues to
increase transparency about problematic export restraint policies in
China and other countries, and to reduce barriers to global trade and
investment in raw materials.
In closing, let me emphasize again that the Executive Office of the
President and the Federal agencies are taking the topics of critical
materials and critical mineral supply chains very seriously. The
Federal agency efforts are coordinated through the EOP-led interagency
process. Despite that process being in its infancy, we have developed a
shared understanding of the problems and issues of critical materials
with our interagency partners, have formulated a game plan for
addressing both short and long-term concerns with critical materials
and are executing on that plan. We remain in close communication with
the scientific, technical, and business communities; and we look
forward to continuing to work with this committee and other members of
Congress to help ensure growth in our national capabilities in this
domain.
Thank you.

Mr. Hultgren. Thank you, Dr. Holdren. Thank you for being
here.
I now recognize our next witness, Mr. Sandalow. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF MR. DAVID SANDALOW,

ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR POLICY AND INTERNATIONAL

AFFAIRS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

Mr. Sandalow. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member
Edwards, and members of the Subcommittee. I join Director
Holdren in thanking you for holding a hearing on this important
topic today.
Earlier this year, I visited the Mountain Pass Mine in
Southern California. I was impressed by the facility and its
potential to provide a domestic source of rare earth metals.
According to the facility's owners, the mine will produce at an
annual rate of about 19,000 tons of rare earth by the end of
2012 and 40,000 rare earth--tons of rare earth by the end of
2014 and doing that using modern technologies at a globally
competitive cost. Now, that is an important step in the right
direction.
The issue of critical materials is important and needs
priority attention in the months and years ahead. At the
Department of Energy, we share the goal of establishing a
stable, sustainable, and domestic supply of critical minerals,
and we look forward to working with the Congress on this issue
as we move forward.
Members of the Committee, the world is on a cusp of a clean
energy revolution. Here in the United States, we are making
historic investments in clean energy. The American Recovery Act
was the largest one-time investment in clean energy in our
Nation's history. At DOE, we are investing $35 billion in
Recovery Act funds in electric vehicles, batteries, and
advanced energy storage, a smarter and more reliable electric
grid, wind and solar technologies, among many other areas.
Now, other countries are also seizing this opportunity. For
example, the Chinese Government is launching a program to
deploy electric cars in over 25 major cities while building
huge wind farms, ultra-supercritical advanced coal plants,
ultra high voltage long-distance transmission lines and more.
India has launched an ambitious national solar mission, and in
Europe, strong public policies are driving sustained
investments in clean energy.
In recognition of the importance of certain materials in
the transition to clean energy, DOE is working to address the
use of critical materials in clean energy components in
products and processes. As a first step, last year we released
a critical materials strategy, the first of its kind ever
released by the Department of Energy. The report found that
four clean energy technologies--wind turbines, electric
vehicles, photovoltaic cells, and fluorescent lighting--use
materials at risk of supply disruptions in the next five years.
In the report, five rare earth elements--dysprosium, neodymium,
terbium, europium, and yttrium, as well as indium--were
assessed as the most critical in the short term. For this
purpose, criticality was a measure that combined the importance
of the clean energy economy and the risk of supply disruption.
Our critical materials strategy highlighted three pillars
to address the challenges associated with these materials in
the clean energy economy. First, substitutes must be developed.
Second, recycling, reuse, and more efficient use can
significantly lower global demand for newly-extracted
materials. And finally, diversified global supply chains are
essential. That means encouraging other nations to expedite
alternative supplies and exploring other potential sources of
materials, in addition to facilitating environmentally sound
extraction and processing right here in the United States
because domestic production is the most secure. With all three
of these approaches, we must consider all stages of the supply
chain from sound material extraction to purification and
processing to manufacture of chemicals and components and
ultimately to end uses.
This year, DOE is updating our analysis. We have in recent
months sent out to the public a request for information and, in
the process, received back over 500 pages of information from
over 30 respondents with a variety of information on multiple
topics. One lesson we have learned through this experience is
that supply constraints aren't static. As a society, we have
dealt with these types of issues before, mainly through smart
policy and R&D investments that reinforced efficient market
mechanisms. We can and will do so again.
We must be smart and serious as we plan for a growing
global demand for products that contain critical minerals. With
focused attention, working together we can meet these
challenges. Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Sandalow follows:]

Prepared Statement of David Sandalow, Assistant Secretary of Energy for
Policy and International Affairs, U.S. Department of Energy
Chairman Broun, Ranking Member Edwards, and Members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the
Federal perspective on a national critical materials strategy and the
Department of Energy's ongoing work on this topic.
Earlier this year I visited the Mountain Pass Mine in southern
California. I was impressed by the facility and its potential to
provide a domestic source of rare earth metals. According to the
owners, the mine will produce at an annual rate of about 19,000 tons of
rare earths by end of 2012 and 40,000 tons by early 2014, using modern
technologies at a globally competitive cost. That's an important step
in the right direction.
The issue of critical minerals is important and needs priority
attention in the months and years ahead. The Department shares the goal
of establishing a stable, sustainable and domestic supply of critical
minerals, and we look forward to discussions with the Congress on ways
to address this issue as we move forward.

GLOBAL CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY

historic investments in clean energy. The American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act was the largest one-time investment in clean energy in
our nation's history--more than $90 billion. At the Department of
Energy (DOE), we're investing $35 billion in Recovery funds in electric
vehicles; batteries and advanced energy storage; a smarter and more
reliable electric grid; and wind and solar technologies, among many
other areas. We aim to double our renewable energy generation and
manufacturing capacities by 2012. We are working to deploy hundreds of
thousands of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure to power
them, weatherize at least half a million homes, and help modernize our
grid.
Other countries are also seizing this opportunity, and the market
for clean energy technologies is growing rapidly all over the world.
For example, the Chinese government is launching programs to deploy
electric cars in over 25 major cities. They are connecting urban
centers with high-speed rail and building huge wind farms,
ultrasupercritical advanced coal plants and ultra-high*voltage long-
distance transmission lines. India has launched an ambitious National
Solar Mission, with the goal of reaching 20 gigawatts of installed
solar capacity by 2020.
In Europe, strong public policies are driving sustained investments
in clean energy. Denmark earns more than $4 billion each year in the
wind turbine industry. Germany and Spain are the world's top installers
of solar photovoltaic panels, accounting for nearly three-quarters of a
global market worth $37 billion in 2009. Around the world, investments
in clean energy technologies are growing, helping create jobs, promote
economic growth and fight climate pillar of global economic growth.

DOE STRATEGY

In recognition of the importance of certain materials in the
transition to clean energy, DOE has begun to address the use of
critical materials in clean energy components, products and processes.
As a first step, DOE released its Critical Materials Strategy last
December. The report found that four clean energy technologies-wind
turbines, electric vehicles, photovoltaic cells and fluorescent
lighting-use materials at risk of supply disruptions in the next five
years. In the report, five rare earth elements (dysprosium, neodymium,
terbium, europium and yttrium), as well as indium, were assessed as
most critical in the short term. For this purpose, ``criticality'' was
a measure that combined importance to the clean energy economy and the
risk of supply disruption.
The Critical Materials Strategy highlighted three pillars to
address the challenges associated with critical materials in the clean
energy economy. First, substitutes must be developed. Research and
entrepreneurial activity leading to material and technology substitutes
improves flexibility to meet the material demands of the clean energy
economy. Second, recycling, reuse and more efficient use can
significantly lower global demand for newly extracted materials.
Research into recycling processes coupled with well-designed policies
will help make recycling economically viable over time. Finally,
diversified global supply chains are essential. To manage supply risk,
multiple sources of material are required. This means encouraging other
nations to expedite alternative supplies and exploring other potential
sources of material (such as existing mine here in the United States.
With all three of these approaches, we must consider all stages of the
supply chain: from environmentally-sound material extraction to
purification and processing, the manufacture of chemicals and
components, and ultimately end uses.
Since the Critical Materials Strategy was released last year, DOE's
work in this area has ramped up considerably. Earlier in 2011, ARPA-E
issued a $30 million Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) on Rare
Earth Alternatives for magnets in wind turbines and motors. EERE's
Vehicle Technology and Wind Programs have also issued relevant FOAs
this year. In addition, the President's FY 2012 budget supports a
Critical Materials Hub. These activities build on DOE's longstanding
expertise on these topics. For example, the Office of Basic Energy
Sciences (BES) has funded research at Ames Laboratory on the production
of high quality rare earth magnets, magnetic technologies, synthesis
technologies and superconductors for a number of years. The Office of
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) has funded several
projects at Ames Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory
addressing alternate magnet and motor designs.
This year, DOE will update its analysis in light of rapidly-
changing market conditions. DOE is analyzing the use of critical
materials in petroleum refineries and other applications not addressed
in last year's report. In addition, DOE may identify specific
strategies for materials identified as critical, including strategies
with respect to substitution, recycling and more efficient use. In
support of this year's analysis, DOE issued a Request for Information
that focused on critical material content of certain technologies,
supply chains, research, education The RFI closed last month. We
received nearly 500 pages of responses from 30 organizations, including
manufacturers, miners, universities, and national laboratories. Many
organizations shared proprietary data on material usage that will help
us develop a clearer picture of current and future market conditions.
Within this larger context, we do intend to address domestic
production of critical materials in our 2011 report. Production within
the United States is important for at least three reasons. First,
domestic production is the most secure. Second, the United States'
considerable reserves of some critical materials could add
significantly to total global production and to greater diversity in
the global supply of these materials. Third, U.S. technology and best
practices developed during mine operations can help promote safe and
responsible mining in other countries, further contributing to supply
diversity and the sustainable development of resources. With regard to
mining in the United States, it is important to point out that permits
are not the only requirements that can extend the time required to open
a mine. The required accumulation of hundreds of millions of dollars of
capital for mine development can also lead to delay.
Managing supply chain risks is by no means simple. At DOE, we focus
on the research and development angle. From our perspective, we must
think broadly about addressing the supply chain in our research and
development (R&D) investments, from extraction of materials through
product manufacture and eventual recycling. It is also important to
think about multiple technology options, rather than picking winners
and losers. We work with other Federal agencies to address other
issues, such as trade, labor and workforce, and environmental impacts.
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has been
convening an interagency effort on critical materials and their supply
chains. In fact, this group met last week to discuss a number of
important developments on these topics.

CONCLUSION

One lesson we have learned through experience is that supply
constraints aren't static. As a society, we have dealt with these types
of issues before, mainly through smart policy and R&D investments that
reinforced efficient market mechanisms. We can and will do so again.
Strategies for addressing shortages of strategic resources are
available, if we act wisely. Not every one of these strategies will
work every time. But taken together, they offer a set of approaches we
should consider, as appropriate, whenever potential shortages of
natural resources loom on the horizon.
So in conclusion, there's no reason to panic, but every reason to
be smart and serious as we plan for growing global demand for products
that contain critical minerals. The United States intends to be a world
leader in clean energy technologies. Toward that end, we are shaping
the policies and approaches to help prevent disruptions in supply of
the materials needed for those technologies. This will involve careful
and collaborative policy development. We will rely on the creative
genius and entrepreneurial ingenuity of the business community to meet
an emerging market demand in a competitive fashion. With focused
attention, working together we can meet these challenges.

Mr. Hultgren. Thank you, Mr. Sandalow.
I now recognize our final witness, Mr. Doebrich.

STATEMENT OF MR. JEFF L. DOEBRICH,

ACTING PROGRAM COORDINATOR, MINERAL RESOURCES

PROGRAM, U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE
INTERIOR

Mr. Doebrich. Good afternoon and thank you for the
opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the role of
the USGS in informing decisions regarding a national critical
minerals strategy.
The USGS is responsible for conducting research and
collecting data on a wide variety of non-fuel and mineral
resources. We conduct research to understand the geologic
processes that concentrated known mineral resources at specific
localities in the earth's crust, and to estimate quantities,
qualities, and areas of mineral resources. We collect, analyze,
and disseminate data and information on current production and
consumption for about 100 mineral commodities both domestically
and internationally.
We also conduct research on the interactions of mineral
resources with the environment, both natural and as a result of
resource extraction to better predict the degree of impact the
resource development may have on human and ecosystem health.
This full spectrum of mineral resource science allows for
comprehensive understanding of the complete lifecycle of
mineral resources and materials: resource formation, discovery,
production, consumption, use, recycling, and reuse, and allows
for an understanding of environmental issues of concern
throughout the lifecycle.
Global demand for critical mineral commodities is on the
rise with increasing applications in consumer products,
computers, automobiles, aircraft, and other advanced technology
products. The USGS has recently completed an inventory of known
domestic rare earth reserves and resources. This study reviews
current U.S. consumption and imports of rare earths, current
knowledge of domestic resources, and possibilities for future
domestic production. The report also includes an overview of
known global rare earth resources and discusses the reliability
of alternative foreign sources.
Though rare earth elements are currently of most concern to
many--including the Department of Defense which funded this
inventory--it should be noted that in 2010 the United States
was 100 percent dependent on foreign suppliers for 18 mineral
commodities and more than 50 percent dependent on foreign
sources for 43 mineral commodities. The import partners include
Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Russia,
Venezuela, and many others.
The USGS is a member of the OSTP convened interagency
process on critical and strategic mineral supply chains. USGS
information on domestic and global mineral production and
consumption and expertise in understanding this information are
being provided to the interagency group to help inform
decision-making and to support the ongoing activities that
relate to a national critical mineral strategy.
In particular, the USGS is taking a lead role with other
interagency members in the recently-established sub-working
group to identify high-priority critical minerals and to
establish a methodology and criteria necessary to make those
determinations. This work will enable the Federal Government to
anticipate material shortfalls before they happen in the market
and will be a core competent in establishing a national
critical minerals strategy.
The USGS stands ready to fulfill its role as the federal
provider of unbiased research on known mineral resources,
assessment of undiscovered mineral resources, and information
on domestic and global production and consumption of mineral
resources for use in global critical mineral supply chain
analysis.
Thank you for the opportunity to explain the role of the
USGS on this very important topic, and I will be happy to
answer any questions.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Doebrich follows:]

Prepared Statement of Mr. Jeff L. Doebrich, Program Coordinator
(Acting),
Mineral Resources Program, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of
the Interior
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee. Thank
you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the role
of the USGS in informing decisions regarding a national critical
minerals strategy.
The USGS is responsible for conducting research and collecting data
on a wide variety of nonfuel mineral resources. Research is conducted
to understand the geologic processes that concentrated known mineral
resources at specific localities in the Earth's crust and to estimate
(or assess) quantities, qualities, and areas of undiscovered mineral
resources, or potential future supply. USGS scientists also conduct
research on the interactions of mineral resources with the environment,
both natural and as a result of resource extraction, to better predict
the degree of impact that resource development may have on human and
ecosystem health. USGS mineral commodity specialists collect, analyze,
and disseminate data and information that document current production
and consumption for about 100 mineral commodities, both domestically
and internationally for 180 countries. This full spectrum of mineral
resource science allows for a comprehensive understanding of the
complete life cycle of mineral resources and materials--resource
formation, discovery, production, consumption, use, recycling, and
reuse--and allows for an understanding of environmental issues of
concern throughout the life cycle.
Global demand for critical mineral commodities is on the rise with
increasing applications in consumer products, computers, automobiles,
aircraft, and other advanced technology products. Much of this demand
growth is driven by new technologies that increase energy efficiency
and decrease reliance on fossil fuels. To begin the process of
understanding potential sources of critical mineral commodities, the
USGS has recently completed an inventory of known domestic rare-earth
reserves and resources (Long and others, 2010). This study restates
basic geologic facts about rare earths relevant to assessing domestic
security of supply and reviews current U.S. consumption and imports of
rare earths, current knowledge of domestic resources, and possibilities
for future domestic production. The report also includes an overview of
known global rare-earth resources and discusses the reliability of
alternative foreign sources of rare earths.
Though rare earth elements are currently of most concern to many,
including the Department of Defense, which funded the inventory, it
should be noted that in 2010 the United States was 100 percent
dependent on foreign suppliers for 18 mineral commodities and more than
50 percent dependent on foreign sources for 43 mineral commodities.
Import partners include Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan,
Mexico, Russia, and Venezuela. In 2008, a National Research Council
committee, funded largely by the USGS, developed a ?criticality matrix?
that combines supply risk with importance of use as a first step toward
determining which mineral commodities are essential to the Nation's
economic and national security (National Research Council, 2008).
The USGS is currently preparing for a national assessment of
undiscovered resources which will include an assessment of rare-earth
and other critical mineral resources. The recent inventory of known
rare-earth resources will be followed by other critical mineral
inventories and used as a foundation for the assessment of domestic
undiscovered critical mineral resources. The preparation for the
assessment involves research and data collection on mineral deposit
types that represent the primary sources of minerals to be assessed,
research on techniques to assess for resources that are concealed below
the earth's surface, and research on techniques to characterize
environmental aspects of mineral resources, prior to, during, and
subsequent to resource development.
The USGS continuously collects, analyzes, and disseminates data and
information on domestic and global rare-earth and other critical
mineral reserves and resources, production, consumption, and use. This
information is published annually in the USGS Mineral Commodity
Summaries (USGS, 2011) and includes a description of current events,
trends, and issues related to supply and demand.
The USGS is a member of the OSTP-convened interagency process on
critical and strategic mineral supply chains. USGS domestic and global
mineral production and consumption information and expertise in
understanding this information are being provided to the interagency
group to help inform decision-making and support the on-going
activities that relate to a national critical minerals strategy. In
particular, the USGS is taking a lead role, with other interagency
members, in the recently established sub-working group to identify
high-priority critical materials and establish the methodology and
criteria necessary to make those determinations. This work will enable
the Federal government to anticipate material shortfalls before they
happen in the market and will be a core component in establishing a
national critical minerals strategy.
The USGS stands ready to fulfill its role as the federal provider
of unbiased research on known mineral resources, assessment of
undiscovered mineral resources, and information on domestic and global
production and consumption of mineral resources for use in global
critical-mineral supply chain analysis.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to explain the role of
the USGS on this very important topic. I will be happy to answer any
questions you or the other Members may have.

Mr. Hultgren. I thank the panel for their testimony.
Reminding members of the Committee that Committee rules
limit questioning to five minutes. The Chair will at this point
open the round of questions. The Chair recognizes himself for
five minutes.
First question, Dr. Holdren, I wonder if you could help me
with this, just some understanding on the interagency working
group. The interagency working group has met over the--for the
last year now. I wonder will it produce any deliverables? And
then I also wonder if you can comment on any proposed
legislation that may complement or duplicate the efforts of the
working group?
Dr. Holdren. Sure. I would actually argue that the working
group has already produced some deliverables. It will certainly
produce more. But its meetings have been working sessions where
the agencies is under the direction of the Executive Office of
the President are actually doing things and committing to do
additional things. Examples include the studies that have
already been mentioned by my fellow witnesses, the reports that
have come out of the DOE and the USGS, World Trade
Organization, litigation from the USTR, the new R&D programs
out of DOE, proactive engagement with industry by the
Department of Commerce and the Office of the Trade
Representative, over a dozen high-level, bilateral meetings
between the Department of State and foreign counterparts on
these issues. And so we have already been actually generating
products, doing things, taking action.
Your question about the legislation, as you know, there are
a number of bills, Mr. Chairman, including one of yours. We
have not taken a formal position as an Administration on the
specific characteristics of these different bills, but there is
a lot in them. And again, I would point to yours in particular
that we are clearly very much in agreement with. Your bill
calls particularly for three focuses. One is on better
information, one is on recycling, and one is on research. We
agree with all of that. And we are already pursuing all of
those avenues.
I would say the additional approaches which we regard as
important and clearly warranted are diversification through
discussion and encouragement not only with companies in this
country but companies located among our friends and allies. And
also, really I would add, negotiation, which includes
discussions with China in both bilateral and multilateral
forums to try to make clear to China that it is actually not in
China's interest to restrict trade in these materials.
Mr. Hultgren. Changing course a little bit, Dr. Holdren,
but again asking you a couple questions here if I may. Just
specifically, according to press reports, the DOD sees that no
rare--there really is no rare earth crisis right now. I
wondered if you concur with the DOD's observation? And then
following up on that, what is your assessment of the rare earth
and critical materials situation in the United States relative
to nondefense applications? And should the United States be
engaged in stockpiling critical materials for nondefense
applications?
Dr. Holdren. Just jotting notes so I can remember all three
parts of your question. First of all, the DOD assessment, we
are actually still awaiting a formal and comprehensive
assessment from the Department of Defense, which is due out
next month. Earlier statements I think were perhaps incomplete,
but I think the basis for them was probably that the quantities
required by the Department of Defense are relatively small
compared to the quantities required in the commercial sector.
And I think the Department's assumption is probably that given
those small quantities and given the very small fraction they
represent of the cost of the systems to which they are
important, the Department is assuming it would continue to be
able to get what it needs, even if at higher cost, without
significant impact on the overall cost of the weapons systems
and the programs. But again, I don't want to preempt the
appearance of their actual comprehensive study on this, which
is due next month.
Your second question was on the overall situation with
respect to these materials in the commercial sector. And
certainly they are very important. The value added by the use
of these materials, even though, as I said, the price of the
materials themselves is a relatively modest share of our GDP,
the value added is much larger. And their importance to
emerging sectors, particularly the clean energy sector that
Assistant Secretary Sandalow was talking about is very great.
So we really have to be focused on our capacity to maintain
access to these materials over time.
When the National Academy conducted its study that came out
just three years ago on minerals, critical materials, and the
U.S. economy, they developed actually a methodology for
defining and quantifying how critical is critical, and they
looked actually at 11 minerals and mineral families. And among
those, the rare earths were the most critical, exceeded only by
platinum and rhodium if you look at the methodology and you
look at the results, criticality in terms of importance and in
terms of the risk associated with our supply of those
materials. That is pretty strong stuff that among all the
minerals we import--and again, my colleague from the USGS
talked about the fact that we are 100 percent dependent for our
supply of 18 minerals and over 50 percent dependent for our
supply of 43--out of all of those dependents as rare earths are
right there at the top in terms of criticality.
One can talk about some very specific ones. Europium, which
has no substitute in red phosphors that are used in our LCD
screens and color cathode ray tubes. That stuff is now going
for around $2,000 a kilogram. And again, there is no
substitute. Erbium, there is no substitute for erbium and its
special properties for use in fiber optic cables. It is going
for about $1,000 a kilogram.
Other materials, cerium has unique attributes that are used
in lens and glass polishing, for example, mirror polishing for
telescopes. It is much cheaper than the others but it has such
unique attributes that one has to consider it critical. A whole
set of them--of the rare earths, neodymium and several others,
samarium, gadolinium, and more are essential in permanent
magnets, in memory sticks, in DVDs. So when you ask what is the
situation in the United States, very important stuff, a lot of
it is critical. We have got to be paying attention.
Your last question was about stockpiles. I think stockpiles
have a very checkered history. The government investing in
stockpiles can be a pipeline by which taxpayer money bids up
the price and gets the private industry out of the business of
having their own stockpiles. I certainly would have serious
reservations about the government investing in stockpiles. The
private sector does have some incentive for stockpiling. It
does do some, and that is one of the reasons that our short-
term situation is perhaps not as serious as the percentage
dependences would indicate.
Mr. Hultgren. Thank you. I now recognize Ms. Edwards.
Ms. Edwards. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the
witnesses.
Dr. Holdren, over the last 30 years we have seen the
government's commitment to addressing critical materials, both
in the Executive Branch and the Congress wax and wane as
different specific crises have emerged and receded, and I think
one of the key things that we need in place is a structure that
is going to remain in place even after you and I have left our
current positions to ensure our government is better able to
anticipate and supply--anticipate supply problems with critical
materials in the future. And so I wonder if you have any
specific recommendations on how to accomplish that, and I
wonder if you could tell me whether you think Administration
policy--either this Administration or past Administration--
actually contribute to the lack of industry development? And I
would note the closing of the AIMS Information Center in the
early part of the last decade and the--you know, the shift at
the same time of the industry almost to--well, pretty much to
zero. And so I wonder if you could comment on that, Dr.
Holdren, and then I will turn to you, Mr. Sandalow.
Dr. Holdren. I have to admit, Ranking Member Edwards, that
I am not an authority on the history of this industry. It is my
impression that the decline of the industry in the United
States and basically the transfer of the production--so much of
the production of these materials to China was, as you
mentioned in your opening statement, largely a matter of
economics. The Chinese simply underbid everybody else. They did
it in part, I think, by neglecting environmental impacts of the
mining of these materials, which are often severe. They are now
coming around to recognizing that and starting to try to
rectify it. I am very much encouraged myself looking forward by
Molycorp's announcements about new technology that they have
developed that will enable production in the United States to
be both more efficient and much cleaner than production was in
the last round. I think this has substantial potential for
restoring our own productive capacity. But I don't think it was
particularly U.S. policies that caused the decline in this
country. Again, I think it was the Chinese underbidding
everybody else.
Ms. Edwards. Well, let me just turn to Mr. Sandalow because
in your statement you mention, one, your visit to Mountain Pass
and the importance of what you were seeing there, but at the
same time, Molycorp has had a bit of a difficulty in securing a
loan guarantee, for example, from the Department. And so that
is about Administration policy because how do you begin to
stand up an industry that then can thrive on its own and have
the capacity to produce in a competitive market when we are
not--I mean we can't provide, obviously, the level of support
that China can provide because you can do that when you have
just got a government that says we are just going to spend here
and we are not going to spend anywhere else, and where we also
have a regulatory structure in place that I think is actually
really important to protecting the public health and the public
interest.
So, you know, Mr. Sandalow, can you just tell me, have you
given any thoughts to what steps need to be taken to protect
our domestic capacity to mine and sell critical materials in
the face of the price pressure from the likes of a China?
Mr. Sandalow. Thank you for the question, Ranking Member
Edwards. And there is no question we need a wide range of
policy tools in order to be able to develop this industry going
forward. The Department of Energy's loan guarantee authority
today does not extend to mining operations, and so there are
limits in the ability of the Department in this respect.
But what we identified in our strategy was a three-pronged
approach, and that includes areas that are particularly in the
competence of the U.S. Department of Energy. For us, research
and development is particularly central. The Department of
Energy is the Nation's leading funder of the physical sciences,
and so research and development in substitutes is particularly
important, research and development into more efficient use and
reuse is particularly important, and then developing a
globalized supply chain, including domestic supply is important
as well.
Ms. Edwards. Let me ask Dr. Holdren because you also
mentioned, obviously, our need to develop a more robust
manufacturing capacity. We could talk about that across all
kinds of lines. But it does seem to me that our manufacturing
capacity--21st Century manufacturing capacity is actually tied
to our ability to produce the domestic supplies that we need
without being held to whatever quotas might be imposed from
those who, in fact, are investing in mining of critical
materials.
Dr. Holdren. I can only agree with that, Ranking Member
Edwards, and I think the whole domain of advanced manufacturing
is immensely important. The President's Council of Advisors on
Science and Technology recently completed a study in that vein.
The President has been out there talking about what we need to
do to lift our game in advanced manufacturing and restore some
real strength to the manufacturing sector in this country. And
I agree with you that attending to these matters of critical
minerals is going to be an important part of that strategy.
Mr. Hultgren. Thank you. I now recognize Dr. Bucshon for
five minutes.
Mr. Bucshon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This, again, seems to be another area where our country is
dependent on foreign nations for sources of minerals, oil,
whatever you want to call it, and it is quite distressing
actually. And I think that this is a great hearing to have
because we do need a strategy to reverse that, just as we do
with our dependence on foreign oil.
The basic question I have is pretty simple. What are the
one or two things that we need to do in our country to decrease
our dependence on China for these type of minerals going
forward? It is pretty simple. I can start with Dr. Holdren and
then everyone can comment.
Dr. Holdren. Well, Congressman Bucshon, I would just say
again that recycling and diversification are two of the most
important things we can do early, and diversification includes
both the development of sources domestically and the
development of sources in friends and allies--Australia,
Canada--countries on which we can really rely not to cut us
off. Recycling also has very substantial potential and we need
to emphasize it. But over the longer run, research to develop
substitutes is going to be crucial.
Mr. Sandalow. I would--Congressman, thank you for your
question and I would echo the thoughtful comments of Director
Holdren and just say as well this is an area that government
and business can work together and work together well and that
a partnership between government and business institutions can
only make a difference for our country. I think it is a place
where government can do the initial research, some of the R&D,
can help to create the knowledge base, and then working
together. We are all headed in the same direction I think. This
is one where we can really come together to help solve the
problem.
Mr. Doebrich. Yes, Congressman, particularly with regards
to supply risk that we are facing with regards to rare earths,
diversifying supply, understanding where our potential future
supply may be able to come from, and that is a role USGS can
help with in terms of assessments for undiscovered rare earth
resources both domestically and internationally.
Mr. Bucshon. I guess the last time we lost our domestic
production was based on economic factors primarily. That is
what I am hearing. What prevents economic factors, competitive
factors to just keep our companies out of business again in the
future, for example, as some people are saying in their
testimony, China just floods the market?
Dr. Holdren. Well, I would say first of all that the
strength of America, American companies, American manufacturing
has always been innovation. And we have to, as the President
has said, out-innovate our competition. And I think it is going
to be innovation that enables us to compete. We have already
heard about some of the innovations that Molycorp itself has
pursued and achieved. And I think that what one finds is over
the long run the strategy of flooding the market with cheap
stuff could drive out your competitors doesn't work very well.
I think China would pay a very high price for doing that, but
we can't, as some other comments have suggested, rely on good
sense from that quarter, and therefore, we have to make--take
the steps and make the investments we need to make sure that on
our own we can do what is necessary and together with our
friends and allies to diversify those sources.
Mr. Bucshon. Mr. Sandalow, any comments on that?
Mr. Sandalow. I think that is very well said.
Mr. Bucshon. I yield back. Thank you.
Mr. Hultgren. Thank you, Doctor.
I now recognize Mr. Miller for five minutes.
Mr. Miller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Dr. Holdren or Mr. Sandalow, in the past the rare earths
research was carried on at the Rare Earth Information Center at
the Ames laboratory and DOE is now proposing an energy
innovation hub on critical materials. What are the advantages
of using a hub or a center to carry out the research?
Mr. Sandalow. Thank you for the question, Congressman. This
is a model that DOE is using now and brings together some of
the best minds in a single place to focus on a challenge of
especial national importance. And that is a goal with something
like a hub. And with concentrated funding, with funding that
will sustain itself over a number of years, bringing together
the best minds and creating synergies between different
disciplines, we think we can make progress. And this is just a
perfect area for doing something exactly like that.
I would say the Ames National Lab, which you point to, has
been a historic leader in this area. It has been a leader for,
you know, since World War II with extraordinary expertise, and
so we want to build on that at the Department of Energy with
substantially augmenting what they have already done with
substantial new capabilities.
Mr. Miller. Okay. Is it more or less cost effective to do
the research in a hub or a center?
Mr. Sandalow. Yes, it is more cost effective and more
productive, more productive to bring different disciplines
together in one place creating synergies and complementarities.
Mr. Miller. Okay. Again, to any of the panelists, do you
think we have the researchers now in the United States who have
the skills and the knowledge to carry out the critical
materials research that we need done, either in the private
sector or in government?
Mr. Sandalow. In my view, Congressman, we do not. We need
concentrated effort in this country to build up the
intellectual capital, not just the industrial base in this
country--you know, in this area. That means, you know, training
chemists with, you know, experts in lanthanide chemistry and a
broad range of other disciplines who can make sure that we are
innovating in a way that will transform this industry and make
a difference for the future.
Dr. Holdren. If I may just add to this, I think candor does
require that we confess that there is some real financial
challenges in this whole domain. You have raised the question--
really the question of our science and technology education and
training in this country. And we know we have to lift our game
in that domain. We have to train more scientists and more
engineers. And we train those at every level from our community
colleges to our great research universities, and we have some
real funding challenges in that domain.
As you know, the President proposed shortly after he came
into office that we should be aiming to double the investments
in our basic science, our most important basic science
agencies, the NSF, the DOE, Office of Science and the NIST
laboratories. And that money radiates out into the research
universities. And it is going to be a real challenge to do that
in the current budget environment. The President has been clear
he wants to do it, but obviously we are going to need the help
of the Congress to pull that off.
Even--and I will say this because my colleague from the
USGS might not want to--the budget of the USGS is an important
issue here. The capacity of the USGS to deliver the analysis
and the information that we need to identify the most critical
areas, to identify the shortfalls potentially before they
materialize, it requires that you maintain those capabilities
with the USGS and the current USGS budget makes it a great
stretch to do that.
Mr. Miller. Okay. Dr. Holdren, you said that R&D reduces
the risk associated with critical material shortages. I think I
know what you mean by that and how that works, but could you
elaborate on that some?
Dr. Holdren. Sure. One of the things that R&D, particularly
in material science, leads to is substitutes. You know, we used
to think we were going to rely on copper for all our
communication circuits. Now, we rely very heavily on fiber
optic cables. That is as a result of research that enabled us
to do that. Research will unquestionably lead to better ways--
in many cases less expensive ways--to achieve some of the tasks
for which we now depend on materials that we have to import.
Mr. Miller. Okay. I yield back my time.
Mr. Hultgren. Thank you. I now recognize Dr. Benishek for
five minutes.
Mr. Benishek. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the
gentlemen for coming. It is a pleasure listening to your
testimony.
Dr. Holdren, I have a question for you concerning your
previous answer. How are you going to convince China it is not
in their interest to control the market on these materials?
Because I don't see how we can do that nicely.
Dr. Holdren. I am not sure we can do it nicely, but there
are a couple dimensions. First of all, they might believe it is
in their interest to control the market, but if we out-innovate
them, they won't be able to. If their only strategy is to try
to drive out the competition by flooding the market with very
inexpensive material, they are going to lose their shirts.
Mr. Benishek. Well, they have done that and they are making
money.
Dr. Holdren. They have done it from time to time in the
past, but I think going forward, if we apply our comparative
advantage in innovation, it is going to be harder for them to
do it going forward.
Mr. Benishek. How is that? They control the market now so
how are you going to do that?
Dr. Holdren. Well, 20 years ago they didn't control the
market; we did. And again, they captured it by underbidding
everybody for the time. But their capacity to do that
indefinitely is limited because------
Mr. Benishek. How is that?
Dr. Holdren. --we will out-innovate them.
Mr. Benishek. How is that? How do we out-innovate them? We
don't have the material.
Dr. Holdren. We do have the material. The United States has
very substantial reserves of this material.
Mr. Benishek. Okay. How do we get that material to market
here in this country faster?
Dr. Holdren. I think we have been talking about how we do
that here. We encourage U.S. corporations to make the
investments. We help them------
Mr. Benishek. My information here is that it takes------
Dr. Holdren. --in research and development and partner----
--
Mr. Benishek. --7 to ten years to get a permit for some of
these mines.
Dr. Holdren. The question of permitting is one that I would
defer to colleagues------
Mr. Benishek. But that is the central issue here, though.
Dr. Holdren. --about permits, but let me simply say about
that I am not sure where the 7 to ten years comes from. I
suspect that part of that is hesitation and delay over whether
one can compete economically and not actually the inability----
--
Mr. Benishek. No, this is an inability to get a permit.
People are willing to do it; they just can't get a permit.
Dr. Holdren. Well, no, I hear you, Congressman. I have not
looked at these analyses of how it takes ten years. I think if
it is taking ten years, that is problematic and we should fix
it.
Mr. Benishek. All right. Thank you. Mr. Doebrich, what
could the Administration do as far as you are concerned about,
you know, making it easier for us to develop these resources
here at home other than talking the Chinese out of controlling
the market?
Mr. Doebrich. Well, from a scientific standpoint, just
providing better information, understanding what our resources
are, where they are, how much there is. I think also beyond the
United States, there are known and potentially future supplies
as well outside of China. And I think that is an important
point to make as well with those who are perhaps a little bit
friendlier trading partners.
Mr. Benishek. Well, I think part of the problem myself--and
I didn't hear any of you address this--was the fact that, you
know, the uncertainty in the permitting process, the
uncertainty in the regulations that they are going to change
from one year to the next as far as, you know, the requirements
for the EPA and all that sort of thing, do you think that has
had any effect on the ability to raise money and market these
big projects?
Mr. Doebrich. Again, from a scientific standpoint, I can't
comment on that.
Mr. Benishek. Dr. Holdren, do have any--Dr. Holdren, do you
have any comment on that?
Dr. Holdren. Well, I did see a statement the other day that
Senator Bingaman offered in which he made the argument that
profitability and not permitting had been the real obstacle and
it is profitability that we have to work on. But I am prepared
to agree with you that we need to simplify the permitting as
well. And I would note that this Administration, this President
has issued an Executive Order on simplifying regulatory
regimes. And a lot of progress has been made on that and more
will be made because we understand that unpredictability and
regulation is an obstacle to investment in business and we want
to improve that situation. We are taking steps to do it.
Mr. Benishek. If you could provide this Committee with some
examples of that streamlining process?
Dr. Holdren. Oh, absolutely. I will submit that for the
record.
Mr. Benishek. Thank you.
Dr. Holdren. Happy to do that.
Mr. Benishek. With that, I yield back.
Mr. Hultgren. Thank you, Dr. Benishek. I now recognize Mr.
McNerney for five minutes.
Mr. McNerney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Doebrich, I would like to get an idea of how much of
environmental damage was done at Mountain Pass Mine before it
was closed. Is that a significant amount of damage or is it not
that significant?
Mr. Doebrich. Sir, I don't have specifics on that but I can
perhaps look into that and provide some information for the
record.
Mr. McNerney. Mr. Sandalow, do you have an idea on that?
Mr. Sandalow. Congressman, I don't know the detailed
history. I did tour the site and I did see the environmental
management techniques that they are applying right now, which
certainly, from a tour, looked very impressive.
Mr. McNerney. So you have confidence in Molycorp's claims?
You think they are reliable? You think they will be as good as
their word on that?
Mr. Sandalow. Well, I hope so, Congressman.
Mr. McNerney. So do--we all do. What I am wondering is can
economic drivers alone, you know, the high cost of water, the
high cost of power, can those considerations alone force--not
force but encourage American mining and reprocessing operations
to clean up and do a good job or are we going to need some
other guidelines to help make sure that that happens?
Mr. Doebrich. Again, from the Department of the Interior's
standpoint, I mean that would be a question perhaps to the BLM
and I would have to defer to them on that.
Dr. Holdren. I guess I would add a comment on that. I
wouldn't say that market forces alone will lead to all the
kinds of environmental controls that one would want, but we do
have in place a very substantial number of laws passed by the
Congress that affect air and water quality and the protection
of land. And my assumption is we will continue to enforce those
laws. And that those together with economic incentives to
become more efficient and cleaner will push us in the right
direction.
Mr. McNerney. And that Molycorp should be able to compete
economically with the China producers within a few years, is
that their estimate? Is that your estimate?
Dr. Holdren. They are saying they can. And I would bet on
it.
Mr. Sandalow. And yeah, I heard that personally as well.
And to just broaden the point, there is no market that American
innovators cannot compete in and win, and this is one of them.
Mr. McNerney. Good. Thank you.
Now, what I want to know is do you feel, Mr. Sandalow, that
the real risk with the current imbalance--trade imbalance--on
this issue is that China will force industries and jobs to
China that won't return? Is that the real underlying risk that
we are looking at here?
Mr. Sandalow. That is a concern to be sure, Congressman. I
think there are other concerns as well. All of these concerns
could be addressed if we are smart and serious about the way
that we do this, with R&D on substitutes and efficiency and on
globalizing supply chains.
Mr. McNerney. Well, I mean I hear that--I hear you saying
if we do recycling, which means people using their cell phone
batteries when they die and that kind of stuff will produce a
significant quantity of these materials, and also innovation--I
mean, what are the potentials there for the recycling part of
this?
Dr. Holdren. I will take recycling on. The potential for
recycling depends on a number of factors. It depends on the
value of the material, it depends on how expensive the
processing is for getting that material out of the products it
is in, it depends on the logistics of how concentrated the
sources of product are that you are going to process to get the
stuff out, and I would say the answer is that recycling looks
good for some of these materials and less good for others.
Recycling is also not going to be adequate in situations where
a market is very rapidly expanding, because the stuff that you
are recycling from is not as large in quantity as what you need
for the expanding sector.
And so, for example, if you look at permanent magnets for
the wind turbine market where wind turbines are growing very
rapidly, recycling is not going to do that for us. I think we
have to be realistic and we have to discriminate between
different circumstances, some where recycling will help a lot,
others where it won't, and we have to rely on other kinds of
measures, including diversification.
Mr. McNerney. Is there a sort of a unified or coordinated
program to put research money in areas where substitution would
be a good alternative, Mr. Sandalow?
Mr. Sandalow. Yeah, this is something that we are investing
money in at the Department of Energy in our Energy Efficiency
Renewable Energy Program in particular, and it is something we
are looking at. We are talking to colleagues around the
government about it as well.
Mr. McNerney. So you are trying to avoid duplication or----
--
Mr. Sandalow. Absolutely, Congressman.
Mr. McNerney. Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Hultgren. I recognize Ms. Adams for five minutes.
Mrs. Adams. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Dr. Holdren, I listened to the back and forth with you and
Mr. Benishek, and I have a question. If you haven't researched
all the factors, how can you make that assertion that China
would not flood the market?
Dr. Holdren. I don't have a clear crystal ball
congresswoman and so I can't assert that China would not. I can
only assert that there would be some disadvantages to China in
doing that. I would also point out that we are engaged with
China in the World Trade Organization, that China has a
considerable economic interest in maintaining good trade
relations with the United States and other countries, and so
there is some leverage there. Nonetheless------
Mrs. Adams. You know they do have a lot of our debt.
Dr. Holdren. They do and that also means it is not
particularly in their interest to try to devastate our economy
because they would drop the value of the U.S. securities that
they hold. But I am not claiming I have a clear crystal ball. I
am simply claiming here------
Mrs. Adams. So it is possible.
Dr. Holdren. It is possible but there are a number of
things we can do, certainly, to reduce the risk from that very
substantially.
Mrs. Adams. In your written testimony you say that USTR is
closely examining China's policies restricting exports of raw
materials, include RE and continues to press China and remove
its export restraints on RE and other raw materials. Can you
elaborate on the state of the conversations between USTR and
PRC? Are we making any headway?
Dr. Holdren. It is my impression that we are making some
headway there but I can't really elaborate. I think it would be
appropriate to defer to the USTR on that point for an up-to-
date assessment of the state of their interactions.
Mrs. Adams. Okay. There is a greater issue, a bigger issue
than rare earths. We have been talking about critical materials
and rare earth today but the Committee has identified similar
failures in other fields. Recent unforeseen shortages in
Helium-3--you know, the ones that used for radiation
detectors--suggest this is an issue greater than just rare
earths. What is the Administration doing to characterize and
forecast supplies and demands of other materials such as rare
isotopes and strategic minerals that may be impacted by
policies decisions outside of the market?
Dr. Holdren. Well, certainly our focus in the
Administration and the focus of outside entities such as the
National Academy that have looked at these issues is not
restricted to rare earths. I commented a while ago that rare
earths are judged to be among the most critical but they are
not the only critical elements and we are looking at the
others. The DOD is looking at the others; the DOE is looking at
the others; the USTR is looking at the others; the Department
of Commerce. We are certainly not confining our attention to
rare earths.
Mrs. Adams. Like plutonium-238?
Dr. Holdren. Well, plutonium-238 is, of course,
indispensible for radioisotopic thermal power generators as we
use on our Mars missions and other such technologies. Helium-3
is essential. And yes, we are looking at that. The DOE looks at
that closely.
Mr. Sandalow. Just to add, Congressman, in our critical
materials strategy last year we looked not just at rare earths
but also at indium, gallium, tellurium, lithium, and cobalt.
And then in the request for information that we just submitted
to the public, we asked about other materials that might be
important, of interest. So it is very much an area beyond just
rare earths that we are looking at.
Mrs. Adams. Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Hultgren. Thank you very much. I know a couple of the
witnesses--panel members need to leave at 4 o'clock, so we want
to be conscious of your time. I see that we still--it is a few
minutes before 4 o'clock, about 20 minutes until, so my hope is
to go through another round of questions. Our Committee rules
say that we are limited to five minutes each, but if we can be
shorter than that, that would be nice to be able to try and get
through all of us. So if that is all right with you all, we
will start going through another round of questions and wrap up
at 4 o'clock so one of you can catch a plane and others have
other things that you need to get to.
Dr. Holdren, one of the provisions of the bill I introduced
instructs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of
Energy to specify a principal statistical agency. I wonder what
your thoughts are on the efficacy and effectiveness of
specifying a principal statistical agency?
Dr. Holdren. Well, I guess my response would be I believe
we have had a principal statistical agency in the USGS and
the--where the rubber meets the road would be what additional
responsibilities the USGS would have under such a provision and
whether they would have the budget to carry out those
responsibilities.
Mr. Hultgren. I think the challenge is can they identify
what the demand is without that. Any thoughts on that or not?
Dr. Holdren. I agree with you.
Mr. Hultgren. Okay. Do any of the other two witnesses have
thoughts on that?
Mr. Doebrich. As Dr. Holdren said, this would apply to one
part of the Mineral Resources Program that provides minerals
information, and we would like to better understand what such a
designation would truly mean, the ramifications of it. And we
would be happy to answer that more fully for the record.
Mr. Hultgren. Okay. We can get you that and that would be
great if you could submit a response to that. That would be
very helpful.
Quickly, just with another minute or two here, I know one
of the challenges is, again, making sure that we have got
people who are capable to be doing this work and certainly we
are talking about the resources but also the intellectual
resources are so challenging here. Specifically, we need
students who have a better grasp of the industrial sciences
versus a specific education in rare earths. I wondered if any
of you have heard concerns about this and what the government,
if it were to spend funds targeting and strengthening
industrial science programs, how would it ensure retention of
this talent in the United States after subsidizing their
education?
Mr. Sandalow. Well, I will just start and then turn to Dr.
Holdren, I just want to thank you for emphasizing this point,
Chairman. It is vitally important. It is vitally important that
we have the intellectual capital in this country to invest in
this area. I often hear that the expertise follows the research
money, and so when the research money is available, then the
expertise will be developed. And so it just underscores the
importance of maintaining federal support for basic R&D in this
area, and in particular, in the areas you point to in
industrial sciences. Industrial manufacturing processes and
efficiency are absolutely critical for U.S. competitiveness in
the decades ahead. So it is vital that we maintain federal
funding support in that area.
Dr. Holdren. I would add I think it is also important as
the formulation your question suggests that we look at ways to
make it easier for foreign talent that gets educated in this
country, particularly getting advanced degrees in science and
engineering, that makes it easier for them to stay here. Right
now, I think we make it too hard for them to stay here. Some,
obviously, are going to want to go back to their countries.
That is not an entirely bad thing because science and
engineering in some respects is not a zero sum game, but we
certainly shouldn't be making it hard for foreign nationals who
are educated here and want to stay to do so.
Mr. Hultgren. To give everyone else a chance, questions as
well, I now recognize Ms. Edwards.
Ms. Edwards. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have a couple
of quick questions.
Dr. Holdren, I just want to point to you. I was looking at
the fourth quarter 2010 reports from Molycorp as another
suggestion about why China might be rethinking things. In
this--in the report, the CEO of Molycorp noted that senior
government leaders in China consistently stress China's intent
to continue to restrict rare earth exports and the possibility
of China becoming a net rare earth importing nation by 2015.
CEO Smith also said, ``These dynamics are why we believe rare
earth pricing will remain robust for the foreseeable future.''
It is also why Molycorp recently committed to expanding its
production capacity from 19,050 metric tons per year in 2012 to
40,000 metric tons per year, which is expected to be achieved
by 2013. And he says that that will position Molycorp to
capture new markets and customers and benefit from continued
strong pricing, hence, a competitor for China, but I think it
is important and highlights the reason that the United States
needs to step up its game, our government needs to step up its
game in order to be able to stand up industries that can
compete.
And I would also note that Molycorp secured all of its
critical government permits that enabled it to proceed with
construction of a new rare earth oxide manufacturing facility
in Mountain Pass. They broke ground ahead of schedule. They are
constructing their new manufacturing facility and they
recommenced mining operations for the first time since 2002.
And that is with environmental regulations in place that are
actually going to protect the American consumer and those who
live in and around Mountain Pass from the dangers that have
befallen the Chinese and the reason that the Chinese, in fact,
are having to make these changes and different decisions about
what they do with respect to their mining.
And I wonder for USGS, Mr. Doebrich, if you could comment
whether from an environmental perspective what sort of concerns
we need to be aware of regarding potential environmental
contamination as a result of these mining operations and how
that impacts what we need to consider in the United States in
terms of our own industry with respect to competition with
China?
Mr. Doebrich. Thank you, Congresswoman.
With regard to rare earths in particular, many of these
rare earth minerals contain radioactive components, and so
radiation is an environmental issue of concern when developing
rare earth resources. So this is an area of research that we
are actually getting more involved with to understand what the
impact--the natural impact of the known resource in the ground
even before resource development, developing baseline
information to understand what the natural baseline geochemical
signature is of these resources to help us better understand
what the impact of resource development would be for different
types of these rare earth deposits. So that is an area of
research that we are involved with right now.
Ms. Edwards. In any case, the goal would not be to throw
out environmental regulations. That is not what is going to
stand up our industry. Thank you, and I will yield back.
Dr. Holdren. I strongly agree.
Mr. Hultgren. I now recognize Mr. Miller.
Mr. Miller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The subject of Helium-3 came up, which is also a subject
that was--that this Subcommittee dealt with in the last couple
of years. The problem with Helium-3 was we didn't know how much
of it we had. That was the biggest problem. We didn't have an
assessment of what the demand was and what the supply was, and
the reason was that Helium-3 was produced by the decay of
tritium, which was used in nuclear weapons and how much tritium
there was and, therefore, how much Helium-3 there was was all
classified, so nobody knew how much there was. And we spent
billions of dollars developing a technology that depended on a
lot of Helium-3 and then found out there wasn't that much
Helium-3.
The Administration actually appears to have done a pretty
good job of dealing with that problem once you realize you had
a problem, kind of assessing what the supply was and figuring
out what the demand was and making decisions about priorities.
But that appears not to have been unique to Helium-3. There are
other problems of identifying supply and demand. Dr. Holdren, I
think you addressed that at least somewhat in your testimony of
identifying the supply and demand.
And there is still a problem--both in the government and
the private sector--of that information not being available,
whether it is treated as a trade secret or confidential for
business reasons or whatever else. How much of a problem is
that, and how are we going to get at that problem to identify
what the demand is and what the supply is?
Dr. Holdren. Well, first of all, Congressman Miller, the
first item on my list consistent with your question of what we
need to do is information. We need to do better with
information, and there I think again the USGS has been a
mainstay of our ability to get that information and my judgment
should continue to be.
My understanding is that companies are becoming more
forthcoming with the kinds of information we need to make these
assessments. I think we are doing better at public-private
partnerships in this domain and in some other domains as well.
Of course, the problem with classified information that you
referred to in the case of tritium is, as always in the case of
those kinds of materials, going to be something of an obstacle.
But it is not true that nobody knew how much tritium we had. It
is just that nobody knew in the public domain how much we had,
and there was probably a lack for a time of connecting the dots
as they say among the different people who had the requisite
information.
But I do believe we are doing better going forward. We have
an approach to open government and transparency in this
Administration that is yielding, I think, real benefits in
terms not only of the kinds of data and databases that the
government is making available but also in terms of an
increasing tendency toward transparency in business.
Mr. Miller. Okay. Anyone else?
Mr. Sandalow. Thank you. If I might add, this is a topic
that I hear about from businesses when I talk about this issue
with them. And they say that government really has an important
role to play in collecting the information. And we were
encouraged at the U.S. Department of Energy to inquire about
this in the last request for information that we put out. And
we did so and, among other things, we said that we would keep
information proprietary and collected it on that basis if
businesses wanted us to do that. So we have collected
proprietary information, looking at ways in which we might be
able to share it while protecting the confidential nature of it
by aggregation or other types of tools. But I hear about this
all the time from the industry as an important area.
I would note, too, that on our Energy Information
Administration (EIA), which is our statistical agency, have
plans to scale up its work in this area but as the result of
the latest round of budget pressures and cuts is unable to
pursue its additional work in this area, which I think is
unfortunate. But this is an area that, no question, that we
hear about all the time in the Energy Department.
Mr. Miller. Okay. Just for purposes of clarifying
something, which was reasonably clear already, but when you say
``flooding the market,'' you really mean that the Chinese are
selling rare earths below cost to drive out competitors is
what--it is called the anti-trust law's predatory pricing so
that other suppliers will not compete because they have a
dominant position in the market and they have got a government
behind them funding it all. Is that generally what you mean
when you say ``flooding the market?''
Dr. Holdren. Well, Congressman, I didn't use the term
``flooding the market.'' Your colleagues used it. But I think
what they have in mind is not what the Chinese are doing now.
The Chinese are, I believe, not losing money under current
pricing. But the concern is that as we start to develop more
effective competition with the Chinese at current prices, the
concern is they could undercut those------
Mr. Miller. Right.
Dr. Holdren. --as happened some decades ago in the
international oil market where we developed some expensive
alternatives to conventional oil and the--and OPEC cut its
prices to undercut those technologies. That history causes
people to worry about that possibility. And as I have said
before, it is a possibility. I don't have a crystal ball clear
enough to rule it out, but I think our strategy needs to be
prepared for a wide variety of possible scenarios. And the way
you get prepared for that, again, is better information, it is
diversification, it is recycling, it is research.
Mr. Miller. Thank you.
Mr. Hultgren. I want to thank the witnesses for their
valuable testimony and for the members for their questions. The
members of the Subcommittee may have additional questions for
the witnesses and we will ask you to respond to those in
writing if that is all right. The record will remain open for
two weeks for additional comments from members. The witnesses
are excused and the hearing is now adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 3:54 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Answers to Post-Hearing Questions

Answers to Post-Hearing Questions
Responses by Dr. John P. Holdren, Director, Office of Science &
Technology Policy (OSTP):

Questions submitted by Chairman Paul C. Broun

Q1.  What are the Administration's short, medium and long-term plans to
ensure adequate supplies of rare earths and critical materials for U.S.
industries?

A1. In the short term, the Administration is using trade relations and
diplomacy to foster the diversification of critical material supply, as
well as taking steps to facilitate domestic production. In the long
term, the greatest opportunities to reduce the risks associated with
supply shortfalls of critical materials are through investments in R&D
and innovation. The OSTP-convened interagency process is addressing
these core themes in both the short and long term. Presently this
interagency effort is organized around the following sets of
activities:

identifying critical materials based on common and agreed
criteria;

promoting more detailed and transparent collection of
information on global resource supply and demand to facilitate the
proper functioning of markets;

establishing federal R&D priorities and roadmaps; and

reviewing-in coordination with our colleagues in the
National Economic Council, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,
the National Security Council, and Federal departments and agencies-
domestic and global policies that affect the supply of critical
materials (permitting, export restrictions, recycling, stockpiling,
etc.) and pursuing remedies for roadblocks.

Q2.  What role is OSTP playing to promote public/private collaboration
in the development of recycling technologies--including technical
standards, guides and best practices--to strengthen recycling for key
materials and to facilitate innovative materials use throughout
economic value chains?

A2. The potential for recycling depends on a number of factors. It
depends on the value of the material, the ease of disassembly or
separation, and how concentrated the material is within a product.
Recycling may be a viable option for some materials but not for others.
Recycling will not be adequate in situations where a market is rapidly
expanding, because the supply of recovered material will not be
sufficient to meet expanding demand.

The President's FY 2012 Budget includes a proposal for a Department of
Energy (DOE) Energy Innovation Hub on critical materials to help reduce
U.S. reliance on critical materials including rare earth elements
(REE). Hub activities on recycling would include R&D on efficient
separation technologies that could be economically applied to both
mined ores and recycled product streams, as well as other strategies
that could significantly lower world demand for newly extracted
critical materials.

Q3.  Has the development of technical standards and standard reference
materials been integrated into the Administration's Critical Materials
Strategy? Will the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) be tasked to lend its technical expertise--particularly in the
development of standard reference materials that help in the
identification and classification of rare and other materials, and that
could facilitate their re-use from electronic scrap, cell phones,
magnets and magnet applications, and batteries?

A3. While NIST has not specifically been tasked with integrating its
activities and expertise into the Administration's Critical Materials
Strategy, NIST's longstanding technical expertise in reference
materials and technical standards could play an important role in any
Federal efforts to develop standards and reference materials related to
critical materials. Of NIST's 1300 Standard Reference Materials (SRMs),
several metal alloys and geological materials have measurement
information on rare earths. A series of calibration standards is
available for calibrating the determination of rare-earth elements
using a wide variety of chemical analysis methods.

Q4.  Our current situation with raw materials is not unique to the
United States. To what extent is the U.S. government coordinating
strategies with other nations in an effort to address this issue by
learning for each other's actions? What nations are more active in
these discussions? What are some of the ideas and strategies that have
been discussed in these collaborative efforts?

A4. I believe the United States government must be prepared for a wide
range of scenarios in this area in the years ahead. The United States
is interested in working with like-minded trading partners to determine
the best way forward to ensure reliable supplies of critical materials
from all sources. We have been working bilaterally and multilaterally
(at the G20, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, the
World Trade Organization (WTO), and other fora) to seek progress on the
issue. We have also hosted direct conversations with: Japan, South
Korea, Germany, Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, European
Commission, and the European Parliament among others. These
conversations have covered collaboration in: research and development,
promoting an open and transparent global market including sharing of
supply and demand information, and the responsible development of
future supply chains.

Q5.  Recent articles have described a potential relationship between
China and Taiwan, where Taiwan would benefit from a special rare earths
arrangement. Can you comment on the significance of such an agreement
and its potential impact on the U.S. and other countries? \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Mozur, Paul and Liu, Fanny, ``Taiwan, China Discuss possible
Rare-Earths Deal,'' The Wall Street Journal, May 18, 2011

A5. At this point, without specific knowledge of the details of a
potential arrangement, any comments on how Taiwan could benefit or how
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
other countries would be impacted would be speculative at best.

Q6.  In an ideal world, what provisions would you want to see in a rare
earths/critical materials bill?

A6. I would welcome provisions that strengthen our capabilities to: (1)
educate and train scientists and engineers in this country; (2)
identify critical materials and establish an appropriate early warning
mechanism; (3) perform a more detailed and transparent collection of
information on global resource supply and demand; (4) support federal
research and development priorities in the areas of substitute
materials and technologies, more atom-efficient use of materials,
environmentally superior mineral extraction and processing, and
recycling; (5) pursue an adequate and diversified supply of critical
materials; (6) identify downstream supply chain vulnerabilities (e.g.
metals, alloys, components, or finished goods) and propose effective
mitigation measures; and (7) review domestic and global policies that
affect the supply of critical materials and pursue remedies for
roadblocks. Such provisions could strengthen efforts the Administration
is already pursuing in these areas.

Q7.  Congress visited the issue of strategic minerals in 1980 with the
National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act,
and again in 1984, with the National Critical Materials Act. The 1980
Act included certain reporting requirements by the National Science and
Technology Council, which is housed in the Office of Science and
Technology Policy. Are you familiar with those reporting requirements?
Understanding that this occurred before your time, do you have any
insight as to why those requirements are not being met? How can we
ensure that we are vigilant in our monitoring of critical materials? Do
you believe annual updates are necessary?

A7. I am familiar with those reporting requirements but do not know the
history of why those had lapsed in previous Administrations. This
Administration, in contrast, has taken the National Materials and
Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act, and the National
Critical Materials Act seriously. It began coordination on this topic
early in the first year of the Administration.

While there are no current plans for the Executive Office of the
President to release documents on the topic, there will be a continuous
stream of reports from our colleagues in the Federal agencies (e.g.
DOD, DOE, USGS) that reflect the collective thinking and analysis of
our interagency process. The set of issues on critical materials is
fluid and dynamic. The market and geopolitical landscape change rapidly
and so too must the U.S. government response.

Q8.  Do you have any suggestions to modify or amend the National
Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980, to
ensure the Act is effective? Are there any additional authorities or
restrictions that Congress should consider to ensure compliance with
the Act?

A8. These Acts are comprehensive but could benefit from an update to
reflect nuances in the present market landscape. One such area that may
deserve additional emphasis is in full supply-chain considerations. The
risks of supply disruptions depend on what form of the material is
deemed critical-raw minerals, metals, alloys, components, or finished
goods. Another area that deserves additional emphasis is training of
the next-generation workforce in materials through STEM-based education
programs.

Responses by Mr. Jeff L. Doebrich, Program Coordinator (Acting),
Mineral Resources Program, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS):

Questions submitted by Chairman Paul C. Broun

Q1.  In this year's (2011) USGS Mineral Commodities Summary: Rare
Earths, China is listed as having around 48% of the world's rare earth
elements, which is a significant up tick from last year's (2010) report
which listed China's number at around 37%.

a.  What is the reason for China's elevated numbers this year?

A1 a. The USGS estimate of China's Rare Earth reserves in Mineral
Commodity Summaries 2011 (MCS 2011) was changed from the previous
year's estimate based upon improved understanding of Chinese reserve
and resource definitions and the comparison of those definitions to
USGS reserve and resource definitions. The concepts are explained for
all countries in Appendix C (Part B) on page 196 of MCS 2011 (http://
minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/mcs/2011/mcs2011.pdf); the
correspondence of the Chinese and USGS terms are discussed in USGS Open
File Report 2011-1042 (http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2011/1042/).

b.  How does USGS determine the presence of rare earths, i.e., what
methods and technologies does it employ?

A1 b. The USGS employs a variety of geologic investigations and
analytical techniques to characterize a region or site for the
existence of rare-earth-bearing mineral resources. Reconnaissance
geologic mapping and use of satellite remote sensing are used to
identify specific rock types known to contain rare-earth minerals.
These rocks are then investigated further through more detailed
mapping, higher-resolution satellite or airborne remote sensing,
sampling for geochemical analysis, and geophysical surveys to determine
the presence of rare-earth mineral concentrations in the rock. Once
surface evidence of concentrations is documented through these
techniques, a drilling program is initiated to begin to explore the
subsurface and to outline identified resources. In the United States,
it is at this point that private industry enters the process to define
identified resources and reserves through drilling and feasibility
studies of developing an ore reserve. In some countries governments
will conduct the initial phases of drilling to define an attractive
resource to interest private investment. The USGS does not explore for
nor drill mineral resources but conducts research on a deposit to
understand the parameters of its formation that can then be used to
predict where other deposits may be found. This research may rely on
samples from drilling that was done by private industry or be confined
to surface or remote examinations as described above.

The USGS National Minerals Information Center (NMIC) collects,
analyzes, and publishes identified resource and reserve information
that is released by private industry and national governments. National
reserves information for rare earths found in the Mineral Commodity
Summaries report, including those for the United States, is derived
from a variety of sources. Lacking national assessment information by
governments, sources such as academic articles, company reports,
presentations by company representatives, and trade journal articles,
or a combination of these, serve as the basis for national reserves
information reported in the mineral commodity sections of this
publication. The USGS collects information about the quantity and
quality of mineral resources but does not directly measure reserves.
Reassessment of reserves is a continuing process, and the intensity of
this process differs for mineral commodities, countries, and time
period. Some countries have specific definitions for reserves data, and
reserves for each country are assessed separately, based on reported
data and definitions. In the Mineral Commodity Summaries report, an
attempt is made to make reserves consistent among countries for a
mineral commodity and its byproducts.

c.  Does USGS have the best tools and employees to accomplish its
mission competently?

A1 c. The USGS Mineral Resources Program, including its National
Minerals Information Center, has the tools and employees needed to
accomplish its core mission competently but lacks capacity to expand
its functions to accommodate increased activity called for in some of
the pending critical minerals legislation. The Mineral Resources
Program has been proposed for budget cuts every year but one [2010]
since FY 2001; for FY 2012, the Administration's budget request
proposed a reduction of $9.6 million (18%) from the FY 2010 funding
level of $53.8 million, which will require the elimination of 49
scientific and technical positions and the elimination of important
research, assessment, and mineral information program activities both
within the United States and internationally. Furthermore, the past and
current proposed reductions to MRP funding make it more difficult to
recruit and retain high-caliber scientists.

d.  Given the jump in China's numbers, should we have expected to
see a jump in resources for other areas such as in Africa and
Australia?

A1 d. No. Given the answer to the first question, there is no reason to
think that new information about and improved understanding of the
classification system used by the Chinese to report their mineral
reserves would cause a change in reserve estimates for Africa or
Australia.

Q2.  The recommendation to develop a ``Principal Statistical Agency''
(PSA) has sparked a debate over whether that should be housed in DOE
and modeled after the Energy Information Agency (EIA), or housed at
USGS and modeled after the Mineral Resources Program (MRP). One
difference between DOE and USGS is the designation of the EIA as a PSA.
USGS has stated in the past that it has concerns about such a
designation as it may threaten the ,goodwill? it currently enjoys with
industry contacts because a PSA designation would require companies to
report to USGS, potentially hurting the existing relationship.

a.  Can you comment on the roles and potential overlaps of EIA and
MRP and how a PSA designation for both offices would impact your
efforts?

A1 a. The EIA and the National Minerals Information Center (NMIC) of
the MRP are both organizational units that collect, analyze, and
disseminate statistical data and information, provide industry
analysis, and conduct supply and demand forecasting. The EIA is
responsible for reporting on four nonrenewable energy commodities (oil,
gas, coal, uranium) and five renewable sources of energy (biofuel,
solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal). The NMIC is responsible for
reporting on more than 80 nonrenewable nonfuel mineral commodities.
There is no overlap in the responsibilities of the EIA and the NMIC.

In a 1997 Order Providing for the Confidentiality of Statistical
Information, OMB established ``a uniform policy for the principal
statistical agencies'' but appears to have used the term principal
statistical agency informally. The Order lists twelve agencies under
the heading ``Designated Statistical Agencies or Units''. These
agencies were determined by OMB to be subject to the 1997 Order and
thus obliged to implement certain policies on confidentiality of
information (Federal Register, v. 62, No. 124, p. 35044-35050) \1\. The
Energy End Use and Integrated Statistics Division of the EIA is
included as one of the twelve agencies or units listed in the 1997
Order. The USGS is not one of the twelve agencies listed in the 1997
Order, nor is any unit within the USGS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Order Providing for the Confidentiality of Statistical
Information http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1997-06-27/pdf/97-16934.pdf

The Confidentiality Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency
Act of 2002 (CIPSEA) defines a statistical agency or unit as ``an
agency or organizational unit of the executive branch whose activities
are predominantly the collection, compilation, processing, or analysis
of information for statistical purposes.'' \2\ OMB, which coordinates
the implementation of CIPSEA, recognized 14 statistical organizational
units as statistical agencies or units for the purposes of CIPSEA in
its 2007 guidance on implementing the Act \3\. The EIA is designated as
a statistical agency or unit under CIPSEA. Neither the USGS as a whole,
nor any part of the USGS, is designated as a statistical agency or unit
under CIPSEA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency
Act of 2002 P.L. 107-347, title V http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-
107publ347/pdf/PLAW-107publ347.pdf
\3\ Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency
Act of 2002 P.L. 107-347, title V http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-
107publ347/pdf/PLAW-107publ347.pdf; ys/pkg/FR-2007-06-15/pdf/E7-
11542.pdf

The designation of an agency or unit as a statistical agency or unit
for the purposes of CIPSEA subjects the agency to different
confidentiality standards. CIPSEA statistical agencies or units must
implement higher standards to protect data confidentiality than other
statistical units. This involves increased physical and IT security
measures, confidentiality training for all personnel, additional record
keeping, informing respondents about the confidentiality protection and
use of information, ensuring that information is used only for
statistical purposes, ensuring that identifiable information is not
disseminated, and supervising and controlling agents who have access to
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
confidential information.

CIPSEA does not convey specific authority to an agency--including the
authority to require companies to report to the USGS, contrary to our
previous understanding. Rather, each agency's authority is defined in
the statutes governing that agency. For example, some CIPSEA
statistical agencies have mandatory data collection authority. In
addition, there are differences in how the agencies are funded.

If a unit within USGS, such as the NMIC, were to be designated as a
statistical unit under the provisions of CIPSEA, that unit would have
to implement additional IT and administrative security measures,
increase personnel training, and meet additional reporting requirements
to comply with the higher confidentiality standards. The
confidentiality of data collected by the NMIC is currently governed by
subsection (f) of the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research,
and Development Act of 1980 (30 U.S.C. 1604(f)).

b.  What are the cost and implications of such a designation for
USGS?

A1 b. The USGS has not conducted an analysis of cost required to
implement the higher confidentiality standards of statistical agency
designation under CIPSEA. The USGS believes that such a designation
would have little impact on the quantity and quality of data currently
collected through a long-standing trust-based voluntary system and does
not anticipate that such a designation would improve our ability to
serve clients.

Q3.  Has your agency commented on any House or Senate rare earths/
critical materials bills? If yes, please provide those comments.

A3. The USGS provided testimony to the House Natural Resources
Committee, Subcommittee on Energy and Minerals on H.R. 1314 on June 3,
2011 and to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on S. 383
and S. 1113 on June 9, 2011.

These testimonies can be found at the following links:

S. 1113: http://energy.senate.gov/public/--files/
BurkeTestimonyS1113.pdf

A4. In an ideal world, what provisions would you want to see in a rare
earths/critical materials bill?

Legislative authorizations that apply to mineral resource work of the
USGS are quite old, dating back to the 1980s and earlier. Much has
transpired since then and it would be helpful to update authorizations
to reflect the current scope of work performed by the USGS Mineral
Resources Program (MRP). There are two very important areas of MRP work
that lack specific up-to-date authority. These are the work of the
National Mineral Information Center (NMIC) and the environmental
science conducted by the MRP.

The NMIC is a function that was transferred to the MRP in 1996 from the
U.S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) at the time of its closure. This transfer
authority was provided in appropriations language only. The transfer
authority should specify data analysis of the domestic and
international supply of and demand for minerals and materials essential
to the U.S. economy and national security.

Specific authorization language that recognizes the importance of the
mineral environmental science conducted by the MRP would be helpful.
This work is key to understanding the parameters for environmentally
responsible development of mineral resources. The MRP conducts research
on the interactions of mineral resources with the environment, both
natural and as a result of resource extraction, to better predict the
degree of impact that resource development may have on human and
ecosystem health. Environmental issues related to mineral resources
have required research to help mitigate impact.

Any bill related to critical minerals should clarify the roles of
specific federal agencies involved in nonfuel mineral resource data
collection, information dissemination, and research on identified and
undiscovered resources. These roles and responsibilities should be
consistent with the expertise that resides in such agencies. The bill
should also ensure that there is no overlap or redundancy in effort
expended on accomplishing the objectives of the bill.

The USGS would welcome adequate and sustainable support for unbiased
and objective nonfuel mineral research, assessment, and information
gathering and analysis that it conducts. These activities are federal
responsibilities that are essential for informing decisions and policy
related to mineral supply sustainability and land management of
resources.
