Overview

In the United States, 104 operating nuclear reactors currently
supply approximately 20 percent of U.S. electricity. \2\ The majority
of nuclear reactors came online throughout the 1970's and 80's, with
the newest nuclear plant beginning generation in 1996. Currently, the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering license applications
for several new nuclear plants that industry is seeking to bring online
over the coming decade. Southern Company is furthest along in this
process, and is seeking a license from NRC to construct and operate two
new nuclear reactors at its Vogtle site near Augusta, Georgia. These
reactors would be the first in a new generation of nuclear plants in
the United States.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The U.S. nuclear industry has experienced significant advancements
in reactor safety and risk mitigation since the construction of the
previous reactor. Recent events have refocused attention to the need
for continual attentiveness to these issues.

Review of Japan

On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck just off
Japan's east coast. The earthquake was the fourth largest recorded in
the last century. \3\ Compounding the devastation of the earthquake, a
massive tsunami followed shortly after the initial earthquake and
struck Japan's coast with little preparation time. The earthquake and
resulting tsunami generated widespread destruction throughout the
Japanese islands and is estimated to have killed over 10,000 people.
Aftershocks continued for weeks impeding humanitarian response efforts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\  ``Largest Earthquakes in the World Since 1900.'' U.S.
Geological Survey. 9 May 2011. http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/
world/10_largest_world.php.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The earthquake triggered the automatic shutdown of 11 of Japan's 55
operating nuclear power plants, as designed. Within close proximity to
the earthquake's epicenter stood three sites with nuclear reactors,
Onagawa, Fukushima Daiichi, and Fukushima Daini. Of the six nuclear
units located at the Fukushima Daiichi site, three were in operation on
March 11 while the remaining three units were shut down for inspections
and maintenance.
While further investigation is necessary to assess the specific
consequences of the earthquake inside the reactors, it is believed all
of the Daiichi reactors responded to the earthquake as intended. The
site, cut off from the electric grid due to the earthquake, operated
during this period as expected with the onsite backup diesel generators
powering the cooling system for each reactor. Approximately one hour
after the earthquake, an estimated 14 meter tsunami reached the
Fukushima Daiichi site, overwhelmed the six meter high barrier, flooded
the generators, swept away the diesel fuel tanks and eliminated all
backup cooling systems located at the station (figure 1).

Lacking the ability to cool the reactors, Tokyo Electric Power
Company (TEPCO), the owner of the Daiichi reactors, immediately began
to experience severe difficulties associated with rising temperatures
in the reactors. Absent primary and secondary cooling systems, TEPCO
began to cool the reactor cores by pumping seawater into the reactors.
Lacking the necessary information on the status of the reactor cores,
water levels in the units dropped, resulting in partial exposure of
fuel rods inside the reactor vessel (figure 2). As the fuel rods were
exposed, the fuel rod's zirconium cladding reacted with water and
generated hydrogen, which accumulated within the unit. The hydrogen
buildup within the reactors ultimately led to explosions in Units 1, 2
and 3 within days of the tsunami and removed the secondary containment
structures of those units.
In addition to the difficulties TEPCO faced stabilizing the cooling
systems for Units 1, 2 and 3, the spent fuel pool located inside Unit 4
experienced problems. Unit 4 was undergoing maintenance at the time of
the earthquake and had offloaded additional fuel rods in the spent fuel
pool. While details are still not clear, in the days following the
earthquake multiple fires ignited inside Unit 4 as a result of problems
with the spent fuel pool. Investigation into the cause of the fires and
specific spent fuel pool issues in Unit 4 are ongoing.
TEPCO continues to pump freshwater into the reactors at Units 1, 2
and 3. Further evaluation of the site's infrastructure is necessary
prior to reconnecting electricity to the reactor and stabilizing the
reactor cooling process. TEPCO is shooting water aimed at Unit 4's
spent fuel pool to ensure the pool is adequately filled. Radiation
levels surrounding the reactors remain elevated; however, they have
notably decreased from spikes following the initial explosions.
Public Health Implications

Immediately following the tsunami and explosions at the Fukushima
Daiichi reactors, the Japanese government ordered the evacuation of a
20 kilometer (12 mile) area surrounding the plant and directed those
living within 30 kilometers (18 miles) to stay indoors. Japanese health
authorities immediately began testing Japanese citizens, particularly
children, for traces of radiation, but found only minimal levels of
exposure. As of April 27, 2011, over 175,000 people have been screened.
Radiation levels in the food supply were also evaluated and some
restrictions were placed on distribution. Testing and evaluation of
public health is ongoing and continue to be closely monitored. Workers
at the Fukushima Daiichi plant were exposed to higher than normal
radiation, though under the emergency dose limit set by the Japanese
government and not enough to induce sickness. TEPCO rotates employees
once the workers reach the permitted dose threshold.
As a consequence ofthe overheating of reactor fuel at Fukushima
Daiichi Units 1, 2 and 3 and overheating within spent fuel storage
areas, radiation was released into the atmosphere and environment. In
the weeks following the release, traces of radiation were detected over
portions of the United States. The trace amounts of radiation led to
public discussion regarding the advisability of purchasing potassium
iodide (KI) pills to prevent uptake of radioactive potassium and the
possibility of radioactive material entering the food chain. \4\ Of
particular note, despite a lack of evidence suggesting human health
would be impacted in the United States, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Regina
Benjamin noted in response to questioning about citizens stocking up on
potassium iodide that such actions were ``definitely appropriate''
precautions to take.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\  For more information on radiation health implications and dose
levels see Congressional Research Service Report titled, ``The Japanese
Nuclear Incident: Technical Aspects,'' R41728
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The spread of radiation has refocused attention on the need for
appropriate evacuation plans in the event of an accident or natural
disaster at a nuclear facility, for appropriate plans for the return
ofpopulations to evacuated areas, the efficacy of KI distribution and
long-term health implications for exposure to low-dose radiation. \5\

Evaluations of U.S. nuclear safety

The nuclear industry and governmental bodies consistently review
nuclear reactor safety and risk mitigation measures in the United
States. However, the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island and the attacks
of September 11, 2001, in particular, spurred significant reviews of
and enhancements to nuclear reactor safety.
Previous reviews provide context for current and future evaluations
of nuclear energy, such as the review currently underway by the NRC in
response to the incident in Japan.

Three Mile Island

On March 28, 1979, a series of mechanical and human errors led to
the most significant accident in the history of the U.S. nuclear power
industry. For reasons still unknown, water pumps feeding the generator
shut down. Because operators had closed valves on the secondary water
system for routine maintenance, the system could not pump any water and
the reactor began to overheat. A relief valve opened automatically to
relieve primary system pressure; however, the valve failed to close
once pressure had been released, allowing coolant water to escape.
Compounding the problem was the failure of plant operators to recognize
the opened valve and a misinterpretation of readings on the control
panel. \6\ Once operators realized the problem, serious damage had
already occurred. When the core was opened four years later it was
discovered that half the fuel rods had melted--a partial meltdown. \7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to Three Mile Island, President Carter chartered the
Kemeny Commission to investigate the accident. The Commission's
recommendations covered a wide range of issues. One recommendation of
note was for the nuclear power industry to establish a program that
``specifies appropriate safety standards including those for
management, quality assurance, and operating procedures and practices,
and that conducts independent evaluations.'' \8\ Further, ``there must
be a system gathering, review, and analysis of operating experience at
all nuclear power plants coupled with an industry-wide international
communications network to facilitate the speedy flow of this
information to affected parties.'' \9\

\9\  Ibid
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a consequence of that recommendation, the nuclear power industry
established the Institute of Nuclear Power of Operations (INPO) and
directed INPO to ``promote the highest levels of safety and
reliability--to promote excellence--in the operation of commercial
nuclear power plants.'' \10\ INPO continues to actively engage in a
partnership with industry to provide valuable safety and risk
mitigation expertise.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
September 11, 2001

After the attacks of September 11, 2001 the NRC issued a series of
orders and advisories to its license holders directing them on specific
threats and security enhancements. For example, the NRC has issued
orders requiring license holders to increase specific security
measures, including: ``increased patrols, augmented security forces and
capabilities, additional security posts, installation of additional
physical barriers, vehicle checks at greater stand-off distances,
enhanced coordination with law enforcement and military authorities,
and more restrictive site access controls.'' In addition, the NRC has
made several changes to its Design Basis Threat (DBT), first
implemented after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. Although the
DBT is not public, it outlines specific threats and characteristics of
adversaries. In April 2003 and March 2006, the NRC made additions to
the DBT with lessons learned from September 11. In January 2007, the
DBT was further amended to consolidate previous additions and
incorporate specific threat factors outlined in the Energy Policy Act
of 2005. \11\

DOE and NRC Nuclear Energy Research Programs

Both the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and the NRC fund
extensive research programs across a wide variety of topics. DOE and
NRC conduct significant research focused on all components of nuclear
facility safety, risk analysis, and reactor design. Given recent
events, the manner in which government research programs inform reactor
safety and regulations are integral to ensure public health and safety.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission

The Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (NRR) is NRC's primary
research entity, coordinating research and informing regulatory
decisions for the organization. The NRR provides all encompassing
research relating to reactor safety, operational regulations,
environmental radiological impact, and performance and reliability. The
NRR office consists of Program Management, Policy Development and
Analysis Staff; the Division of Engineering; Division of Systems
Analysis; and Division of Risk Analysis. The primary responsibility of
NRR is to provide ``leadership and plan, recommend, manage, and
implement programs of nuclear regulatory research and interface with
all NRC Offices and the Commission on research issues.'' \12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\12\  All NRR and Division responsibilities are summarized from:
United States. Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards., 20
Apr 2011. Web. 9 May 2011. http://nrc.gov/about-nrc/organization/
nmssfuncdesc.html.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Among NRR's tasks, the Office:

Recommends regulatory actions to resolve ongoing and
potential safety issues for nuclear power plants and other
facilities regulated by the NRC;

Conducts research to reduce uncertainties in areas of
potentially high safety or security risk or significance;

Develops the technical basis for risk-informed,
performance-based regulations in all areas regulated by the
NRC;

Leads the agency's initiative for cooperative
research with DOE and other Federal agencies, the domestic
nuclear industry, U.S. universities, and international
partners;

Maintains technical capability to develop information
for resolution of nuclear safety and security issues and
provides technical support and consultation to the Program
Offices in the specialized disciplines involved in these issues
and;

Collects and analyzes operational data; assesses
trends in performance from this data; evaluates operating
experience to provide insights into and improve the
understanding of the risk significance of events, precursors
and trends; and produces and disseminates periodic performance
indicator and Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) Reports. \13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\  Ibid
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The various divisions provide valuable, informative research
relating to reactor safety and risk mitigation. For example, the
Division of Systems Analysis conducts research to quantify margins,
reduce unnecessary burden, and reduce uncertainties for areas of
potentially high risk or safety significance, supports identification
of accident phenomena and assessment of anticipated safety issues in
new and advanced reactors, and develops technical bases for dose limits
in regulations. The Division of Risk Analysis develops, recommends,
plans, and manages research programs relating to probabilistic risk
assessments (PRA); develops and uses PRA-based methodologies, models,
and analysis techniques, as well as other risk assessment techniques to
determine overall risk; and supports agency efforts to use risk
information in all aspects of regulatory decision making.

Department of Energy--Office of Nuclear Energy

The primary mission of the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) is to
``advance nuclear power as a resource capable of meeting the Nation's
energy, environmental, and national security needs by resolving
technical, cost, safety, proliferation resistance, and security
barriers through research, development, and demonstration as
appropriate.'' \14\ The Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 continuing resolution
provided $737 million for the Office of Nuclear Energy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\14\  ``Mission Statement.'' U.S. Department of Energy. 9 May 2011.
http://nuclear.energy.gov/neMission.html.

Unlike the NRC, NE's research, development, and deployment programs
are not consolidated within one office, but rather undertaken
throughout all of NE's program offices. Safety and risk mitigation
activities span fuel cycle research, advanced reactor research, and
light water reactor sustainability research. For example, future
reactor designs have passive cooling systems to cool nuclear reactor
cores even in the absence of electricity. The Westinghouse AP1000
reactor design, currently under consideration for licensing by the NRC,
has a passive cooling system and Small Modular Reactors also
incorporate the technology.
Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is DOE's lead nuclear energy
research and development facility. Primary NE tasks undertaken at INL
include nuclear safety analysis, irradiation services, nuclear
operations, management of spent nuclear fuel, and biocorrosion offuels.
\15\ These efforts are carried out through funding from the various NE
research programs. Located at INL are a munber of facilities providing
world class research capabilities for DOE, such as the Advanced Test
Reactor Complex which is also a DOE National Scientific User Facility.
Significant additional NE R&D is carried out at other Federal
facilities, such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Argonne National
Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Savannah River Site.

DOE's Office of Health, Safety and Security includes the Risk
Assessment Technical Experts Working Group to assist DOE with the use
of ``quantitative risk assessment in nuclear safety related
activities.'' These activities ``help DOE ensure that risk assessments
supporting nuclear safety decisions are conducted in a consistent
manner, or appropriate quality, properly tailored to the needs of the
decisions they are intended to support and documented.'' \16\

Need for future reactor safety research, risk assessment, and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
accident mitigation

The incident at the Fukushima Daiichi reactors has highlighted the
need for continual examination of safety and risk assessment in the
United States. Policies and priorities undergoing heightened assessment
include:

Spent fuel management. What is the best and most
secure method of storing spent nuclear fuel? In a spent fuel
pool or dry cask storage? In a single centralized storage
facility, such as the proposed, but now cancelled Yucca
Mountain repository, or onsite at individual reactor locations,
including at sites containing decommissioned reactors?

Risk assessment modeling and risk mitigation. How can
risk uncertainty be reduced to the greatest degree and
incorporated into risk mitigation measures? What are the
necessary inputs to produce the most realistic risk assessment
models?

Reactor design. What design features may warrant
incorporation into the new reactors to make nuclear reactors
inherently more safe and resilient to natural disasters? Do
different reactor technologies offer additional safety and risk
mitigation benefits?

Emergency planning. Are current Emergency Planning
Zones adequate? Are the lines of communication between
stakeholders clear and proper? Are additional steps to ensure
public health safety necessary?

Response. How can response capabilities be improved
in the event of a disaster? What R&D is needed in this area?
Chairman Broun. Good morning. This joint hearing of the
Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight and the
Subcommittee on Energy and Environment will come to order. I
welcome everyone here to this hearing, ``Nuclear Energy Risk
Management.'' In front of you are packets containing the
written testimony, biographies, and truth of testimony
disclosures for today's witnesses.
Before we get started, since this is a joint hearing
involving two Subcommittees, I want to explain how we will
operate procedurally so all Members understand how the question
and answer period will be handled. As always, we will alternate
between the Majority and Minority Members, and allow all
Members an opportunity for questioning before recognizing a
Member for a second round of questions, if we have time for the
second round. We will recognize those Members present at the
gavel in order of seniority on the full Committee, and those
coming in after the gavel would be recognized in the order of
their arrival.
I now recognize myself for a five minute opening statement.
I would first like to welcome our witnesses to today's hearing,
and express my sincere appreciation for their effort in joining
us here today.
Risk assessment and risk management associated with nuclear
energy are timely and important topics for the Science
Committee to address. This topic is clearly a priority for the
Science Committee, as two of our Subcommittees are here today
together. While the facts and implications of the Japanese
earthquake, tsunami, and resulting nuclear disaster are still
being determined, it is an opportunity for us to reassess our
Nation's current safety posture here in this country.
After the Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, September 11, and
several other incidents, the United States regularly revisited
the state of our nuclear power infrastructure. Today's hearing
is yet another opportunity to evaluate whether we, as a Nation,
are doing everything that we can to ensure that nuclear energy
is a safe component of our energy supply. This includes
evaluating the current research and development portfolio for
reactor safety, spent fuel storage, and public health
monitoring.
The Department of Energy was invited to this morning's
hearing and would have provided a valuable contribution to the
hearing. Unfortunately, they were unable to provide a witness
here today. DoE did provide written comments, but that does not
substitute for actually appearing. Testifying is not a
correspondence course. The Science Committee understands the
many demands that agency officials have on their time. As
Members of Congress, we have similar demands. Because of this,
the Committee provided four weeks of notice and did not request
a specific individual, leaving that determination to DoE.
Unfortunately, it seems as though the entire Department only
has one individual that they believe is qualified to speak on
the issues that we are addressing here today, and he was
otherwise engaged for multiple days.
While I find this troubling in and of itself, what is more
frustrating is that this has now become a trend for this
Administration. The TSA refused to testify at a hearing earlier
this year before the I&O Subcommittee. Two days ago EPA refused
to testify before the full Committee unless they could dictate
the terms of their attendance.
Let me be clear. This Committee is willing to work with the
Administration to reach neutral accommodations, but it will not
allow it to obstruct our oversight efforts. We take our
oversight responsibilities very seriously. This
Administration's arrogance continues to undermine its claims of
transparency and openness, particularly when they fail to be
accountable to Congress and to the American people. If the
Administration is not willing to work with this Committee, we
have several options that can compel their cooperation.
Unfortunately, it appears that we may have to exercise those
options in the future.
For the witnesses that did appear today, I want to
sincerely thank you for your cooperation.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Broun follows:]
Prepared Statement of Chairman Paul Broun, M.D.
I would first like to welcome our witnesses to today's hearing and
express my sincere appreciation for their effort in joining us here.
Risk Assessment and Risk Management associated with Nuclear Energy are
important and timely topics for the Science Committee to address. This
topic is clearly a priority for the Science Committee as two of our
Subcommittees are here together today. While the effects and
implications of the Japanese earthquake, tsunami, and resulting nuclear
disaster are still being determined, it is an opportunity for us to
reassess our nation's current safety posture here in this country.
After Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, September 11th, and several other
incidents, the United States regularly revisited the state of our
nuclear power infrastructure. Today's hearing is yet another
opportunity to evaluate whether we, as a nation, are doing everything
we can to ensure that nuclear energy is a safe component of our energy
supply. This includes evaluating the current research and development
portfolio for reactor safety, spent fuel storage, and public health
monitoring.
The Department of Energy was invited to this morning's hearing and
would have been provided a valuable contribution to the hearing.
Unfortunately, they were unable to provide a witness to appear today.
DOE did provide written comments, but that does not substitute for
actual appearing. Testifying is not a correspondence course. The
Science Committee understands the many demands that agency officials
have on their time, as Members of Congress have similar demands.
Because of this, the Committee provided four weeks of notice, and did
not request a specific individual, leaving that determination to DOE.
Unfortunately, it seems as though the entire Department only has one
individual they believe is qualified to speak to the issues we are
addressing today - and he was otherwise engaged for multiple days.
While I find this troubling in and of itself, what is more frustrating
is that this has now become a trend with this Administration. The TSA
refused to testify at a hearing earlier this year before the I&O
Subcommittee, and two days ago EPA refused to testify before the Full
Committee unless they could dictate the terms of their attendance.
Let me be clear, this Committee is willing to work with the
Administration to reach mutual accommodations, but it will not allow it
to obstruct our oversight efforts. We take our oversight
responsibilities very seriously. This Administration's arrogance
continues to undermine its claims of transparency and openness,
particularly when they fail to be accountable to Congress and the
American people. If the Administration is not willing to work with this
Committee, we have several options that can compel their cooperation.
Unfortunately, it appears we may have to exercise those options in the
future.
For the witnesses that did appear today, I want to sincerely thank
them for their cooperation. I look forward to their testimony, and will
now recognize Ms. Edwards, the Ranking Member of the Investigations and
Oversight Subcommittee for an Opening Statement.

Chairman Broun. The Chair now recognizes Ms. Edwards for an
opening statement.
Ms. Edwards. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning. I
look forward to today's hearing and thank the witnesses,
because I think for far too long we have heard just a drum beat
about how nuclear energy is both safe and efficient, with
electricity produced ``too cheap to meter.'' I want to thank
the Chairman for giving Members a chance to get to the bottom
of these claims and others.
The idea of nuclear power as a cost effective source of
power can be traced back to a statement in 1954 by the then-
Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, who suggested that
``Our children will enjoy in their homes electrical energy too
cheap to meter.'' Unfortunately that same year, of course,
General Electric ran an advertisement which I am attaching to
my statement--it is quite interesting--from 1954 that
optimistically trumpeted how the industry would be on its own
two feet within five to ten years. That was in 1954. After
suggesting that the big question on atomic energy was whether
it could be done economically, the ad says, and I quote, ``We
already know the kinds of plants which will be feasible, how
they will operate, and we can estimate what their expenses will
be. In five years, certainly within ten, a number of them will
be operating at about the same cost of those using coal. They
will be privately financed and built without government
subsidy.'' So here we are and it is 2011, and the reality is
that nuclear power has always required government subsidies. In
the almost 60 years since that ad appeared, the taxpayer has
seen more than $80 billion spent on nuclear power research and
development. In fact, it is the largest single energy research
area since 1948. There are billions and billions and billions
of dollars in other subsidies created through government
actions designed to distort markets to give nuclear power a
competitive edge over other sources of energy, although we are
in a discussion now about how heavily subsidized the oil
industry is.
Despite decades of support, nuclear power plants are still
unable to operate competitively in the United States energy
market, and now we are being asked for still more subsidies to
build another generation of plants. According to an analysis by
the Union of Concerned Scientists, these subsidies could be
worth twice as much as the value of the electricity produced by
the plant. That strikes me as throwing a lot of good money
after bad.
We recently held a hearing on renewable energy in which the
Majority seemed to want to make the point that subsidizing
renewable energy would be picking winners and losers, and yet
that same strategy that energy produced would not be
competitive without government support is being used with
respect to the nuclear industry.
Well, if you truly reject such support, the nuclear power
industry should be the poster child for an industry that needs
government to profit up, and profit up to the tune of billions
of dollars. I support subsidies to help emerging energy sources
such as wind and solar and battery technologies. They deserve
at least as much of a chance as nuclear has had, and since
nuclear cannot stand on its own feet after 60 years, it is time
to say enough. The public gravy train has got to come to a stop
for now for this mature industry, and it is indeed a mature
industry, it just can't stand on its own, and its claims of
safety, the events of Japan's Fukushima plant illustrate how
safety is contingent on a complex set of systems all working
perfectly. If those systems go down, system safety starts to
slip beyond our control. Natural disasters and human folly know
no national bounds, and it would be beyond arrogant to think
that something similar to Fukushima could not happen here in
the United States.
To avoid another accident requires aggressive regulators,
safety-minded operators, and perfect luck. As was illustrated
in a recent New York Times article, attached also to my
statement, operators often confuse profit margins with safety
margins and regulators are too passive or overwhelmed to always
enforce accountability. In fact, there are claims that the
regulatory agency is too cozy with the industry.
A recent report from the Union of Concerned Scientists
documents 14 near-misses in just the past year, including one
at Maryland's own Calvert Cliffs plant, located approximately
50 miles from where we sit today. Calvert Cliffs has two
reactors. In February 2010, both reactors were automatically
shut down. The cause of the shutdown was that water had shorted
out a degraded piece of electric equipment that had neither
been inspected or replaced. A subsequent study--investigation
by the NRC revealed that the water resulted from chronic roof
leaks. In fact, the NRC found that there were 58 outstanding
work orders to repair roof leaks, and despite some of the
orders being two years old, not one of them had even been
scheduled for repair.
Each shutdown, like the one at Calvert Cliffs, caused plant
owners and ultimately rate payers an average of more than $1.5
billion. Since the Three Mile Island accident, safety failures
have resulted in plant shutdowns costing more than $80 billion.
So we subsidize the energy--the industry's creation, the
building of plants the production of electricity, and then we
subsidize a failure of plant management. I think enough is
enough, and with that, I yield.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Edwards follows:]
Prepared Statement by the Honorable Donna F. Edwards
I look forward to today's hearing because for too long we have
heard a drumbeat about how nuclear energy is both safe and efficient,

claims.
The idea of nuclear power as a cost-effective source of power can
be traced back to a statement in 1954 by the then-Chairman of the
Atomic Energy Commission who suggested that ``Our children will enjoy
in their homes electrical energy too cheap to meter. . .'' That same

The reality is that nuclear power has always required government
subsidies. In the almost sixty years since that ad appeared, the
taxpayer has seen more than $80 billion spent on nuclear power research
and development. In fact, it is the largest single energy research area
since 1948. And there are billions and billions and billions of dollars
in other subsidies created through government actions designed to
distort markets to give nuclear power a competitive edge. Subsidies
include the Price-Anderson Act, which caps nuclear plant operators
exposure to costs that would come from an accident, loan guarantees to
underwrite the capital costs of plants, tax exempt bonds for
construction of public plants, no charges to plants for their use of
water and the list goes on and on.
Despite decades of support, nuclear power plants are still unable
to operate competitively in the U.S. energy market. Now, we are being
asked for still more subsidies to build another generation of plants.
According to an analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists, these
subsidies could be worth twice as much as the value of the electricity
produced by the plants. That strikes me as throwing good money after
bad.
We recently held a hearing on renewable energy in which the
Majority seemed to want to make the point that subsidizing renewable
energy would be ``picking winners and losers'' or distorting the market
and that the energy produced would not be competitive without
government support. Well, if you truly reject such support, the nuclear
power industry should be the poster child for an industry that needs
government to prop it up.
I do not oppose subsidies to help new energy sources get on their
feet I believe we should be investing in wind and solar and battery
technologies and exploring other potential renewables to give them a
chance to demonstrate their value to meeting our country's energy
needs. They appear to be safer to the public and the environment than
any other sources of electricity and they promise true energy
independence without worries about proliferation of nuclear materials.
They deserve at least as much of a chance as nuclear has had, and since
nuclear cannot stand on its own feet after sixty years, it is time to
say ``enough.'' The public gravy train has got to come to a stop for
this now mature industry.
As to c1airus of safety, the events at Japan's Fukushima plant
illustrate how safety is contingent on a complex set of systems all
working perfectly. If those systems go down, safety starts to slip
beyond our control. Natural disasters and human folly know no national
bounds and it would be beyond arrogant to think that something similar
to Fukushima could not happen here.
The risks posed by nuclear power are unique in their potential
health and environmental scope. In the last thirty years, we have had
three catastrophic accidents of varying effect: Three Mile Island,
Chernobyl, and Fukushima. To avoid another accident requires aggressive
regulators, safety-minded operators, and perfect luck. As was
illustrated in a recent New York Times article, operators often confuse
profit margins with safety margins and regulators are too passive or
overwhelmed to always enforce accountability.
To keep the public safe from disaster, you have to get nuclear
plant safety right every second of every day of every year and
everywhere. And natural disasters cannot be allowed to interfere or
those carefully calibrated perfect systems can fail. I think that this
is an impossible standard, but a failure once a generation or so is not
acceptable to me. In fact, the Union of Concerned Scientists has issued
a report documenting 14 near misses just in the past year, including
one at Maryland's own Calvert Cliffs plant.
Located approximately 50 miles from where we sit today, Calvert
Cliffs has two reactors. In February 2010, both reactors were
automatically shut down. The cause of the shut-down was that water had
shorted out a degraded piece of electrical equipment that had neither
been inspected nor replaced. And the water, as a subsequent NRC
investigation revealed, was the result of chronic roof leaks. In fact,
the NRC found that there were 58 outstanding work orders to repair roof
leaks. Despite some of the orders being two years old, not one of them
had even been scheduled for repair.
I am sure that a nuclear advocate would point to Calvert Cliffs'
automatic shutdown as a ``success.'' But such successes, in which
safety systems shut reactors down in the face of systems operating out
of spec, are not cost free. Each shutdown costs plant owners, and
ultimately rate payers, an average of more than $1.5 billion dollars.
Since the Three Mile Island accident safety failures that resulted in
plant shutdowns cost more than $80 billion.
So we subsidized the industry's creation, the building of plants,
the production of electricity and then we subsidize the failures of
plant managers.
I think enough is enough.

Chairman Broun. Thank you, Ms. Edwards.
I now recognize the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy
and Environment, Dr. Harris, for his opening statement.
Dr. Harris, you are recognized for five minutes.
Dr. Harris. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to
thank our witnesses also for being here today to testify on
issues relating to nuclear energy risk management, and I do
look forward to hearing from all your testimony.
First I would like to echo Dr. Broun's disappointment with
the Department of Energy's inability to provide a witness for
the hearing. I do recognize that the head of the Office of
Nuclear Energy was unavailable due to international travel, but
I would hope that in a program with a budget of over $850
million that the Department has more than one individual
qualified to represent it before Congress.
The purpose of this hearing is to examine nuclear energy
safety, risk assessment, and public health protection. Nuclear
energy is clearly an integral piece of America's energy
portfolio today, and will probably continue to be in the
future.
In Maryland, my State, one-third of our electricity is
generated by nuclear reactors, and the State is home to two
reactors located near my district at Calvert Cliffs.
DoE's Energy Information Administration projects that U.S.
electricity demand will increase by 31 percent over the next 25
years. We simply have to get this electricity from somewhere,
and nuclear energy may indeed provide a clean, safe, and
affordable source of base load power to meet this demand.
However, as with all critical energy sources, producing nuclear
energy is certainly not without risk, and we must take great
care to appropriately manage those risks. The March earthquake
and tsunami in Japan clearly serves as a stark reminder of
this. However, it is important to note that the incident and
response at Fukushima did not happen in a vacuum. Both the
nuclear industry and government regulators continually assess
safety measures and mitigate those kind of risks. Largely due
to this diligence and attentiveness, nuclear facilities in this
country are among the safest workplaces across all industries,
and not a single death has been attributed to nuclear energy
production here in the United States.
As I hope to hear today, continued improvements in reactor
design and operating procedures will make what is already safe
nuclear energy even safer. To this end, I am interested in
learning how the Federal Government can best prioritize its
nuclear energy research programs to further reduce these risks.
I am also interested in key policy questions associated
with nuclear energy risk management. For example, is a
Fukushima-like event even possible here in the U.S., given our
regulatory environment and reactor design? Do facilities pre-
stage the necessary equipment to manage unexpected incidents?
What are the comparative risks associated with storage of spent
nuclear fuel scattered throughout the country or consolidated
into centralized storage, such as Yucca Mountain.
Finally, as a medical doctor by training, I believe it is
important to objectively and responsibly discuss potential
radiologic effects on public health. Senior government
officials encouraging Americans to stockpile potassium iodide
pills due to detection of miniscule traces of radiation is
simply not responsible, since potassium iodide can obviously
have harmful results if those pills are unnecessarily taken.
This kind of alarmism also feeds unnecessary public fears about
nuclear energy potentially harming its future viability.
I hope the witnesses can help provide perspective on this
issue. I look forward to hearing today's discussion surrounding
these topics. Again, I thank you all for appearing. I thank the
Chairman for holding the hearing, and I yield back.

STATEMENT OF DR. BRIAN SHERON, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF NUCLEAR
REGULATORY RESEARCH, NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

Dr. Sheron. Thank you. Good morning Chairmen Harris and
Broun, Ranking Members Miller and Edwards, Members of the
Subcommittees. I am pleased to appear before you on behalf of
the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the NRC, to
discuss the Agency's research program and our current
activities in response to the events that have occurred at the
Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant site.
My name is Brian Sheron. I have been the Director of the
NRC's Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research for the past five
years, and have been at the NRC and its predecessor agency, the
Atomic Energy Commission, for nearly 38 years.
The following testimony is intended to provide an overview
of NRC's Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, or RES, and its
current activities, as well as provide a discussion of the
Agency taskforce and research activities related to the
Fukushima-Daiichi event in Japan.
Office of Research is a major NRC program office mandated
by Congress and created along with the NRC in 1975. The NRC's
regulatory research program addresses issues in the areas of
nuclear reactors, nuclear materials, and radioactive waste. My
office plans, recommends, and implements programs of nuclear
regulatory research, standards development, and resolution of
generic issues for nuclear power plants and other facilities
regulated by the NRC. There are currently about 260 staff
members in my office.
We do not conduct research for the primary purpose of
developing improved technologies. That is a function that is
more appropriately the nuclear industry's. Rather, the NRC
conducts research to confirm that the methods and data
generated by the industry ensure that adequate safety margins
are maintained.
We work with the offices that are responsible for licensing
activities within the NRC to develop appropriate regulatory
actions to resolve potential safety issues for nuclear power
plants and other facilities regulated by the NRC, including
those issues designated as generic issues. Generic issues are
potential technical or security issues that could impact two or
more facilities.
My office coordinates the development of consensus and
voluntary standards for agency use, including appointment of
Agency staff to numerous domestic and international standards
committees. Participation by the NRC staff in consensus
standards development is essential because the codes and
standards are an integral part of the Agency's regulatory
framework.
We have implemented over 100 international cooperative
agreements with other nuclear regulators and international
organizations to share information and leverage resources. We
also participate extensively in several International Atomic
Energy Agencies, and Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency committees and working groups
that facilitate the exchange of information between countries
on topics such as risk assessment, events, and best practices.
The NRC has a robust reactor operating experience program,
and we have taken advantage of the lessons learned from
previous operating experience to implement a program of
continuous improvement for the U.S. reactor fleet. As you know,
on Friday, March 11, 2011, an earthquake and subsequent tsunami
occurred near the northeast coast of Japan, resulting in the
shutdown of more than 10 reactors. From what we know now, it is
likely that the earthquake caused the loss of normal
alternating current power and it is likely that the reactor's
response to the earthquake went as designed. The ensuing
tsunami, however, caused the loss of emergency A/C power to
four of the six units at the Fukushima site.
The phenomena associated with the events at Fukushima
involved numerous disciplines in which my office has expertise
and has done substantial research. I would now like to discuss
some of these technical areas that have been raised since the
events.
The Office of Research has a seismic research program that
is currently addressing updated geological assessments,
particularly in the central and eastern United States. We have
also initiated a current tsunami research program in 2006, and
our tsunami research leverages work being done at the United
States Geological Survey and the National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration. This will help form the basis for
NRC review of new license applications.
We have performed significant severe accident research
since the TMI accident to better understand the phenomena and
improve both accident prevention and mitigation.
The NRC has been using probabilistic risk assessment, or
PRA methods to obtain estimates of risk associated with severe
accidents since 1975.
The NRC has previously studied spent fuel pool issues and
implemented additional requirements to minimize spent fuel pool
vulnerabilities. Following the events in Japan, we have begun
to update spent fuel pool studies to estimate the relative
consequence of removing older fuel from the spent fuel pool and
placing it into dry storage, versus leaving it in the spent
fuel pool.
In conclusion, I want to reiterate that the NRC has a very
robust regulatory research program that performs confirmatory
research to allow the licensing offices to make technically-
informed regulatory decisions. The research office has
expertise in a multitude of technical disciplines and has
performed significant research in the past related to reactors,
materials, and waste.
In light of the events in Japan, the NRC has initiated a
near-term evaluation of the event's relevance to reactors in
the U.S. and we are continuing to gather the information
necessary for us to take a longer, more thorough look at the
events and their lessons for us. Based on the lessons learned
from these efforts, we will pursue additional regulatory
actions and research as needed to ensure the continuing safety
of the U.S. fleet.
Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Sheron follows:]
Prepared Statement of Dr. Brian Sheron, Director, Office of Nuclear
Regulatory Research, Nuclear Regulatory Commission
Good morning, Chairmen Harris and Broun, Ranking Members Miller and
Edwards, and Members of the Subcommittees. I am pleased to appear
before you on behalf of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) to discuss the agency's research program and our current
activities in response to the events that have occurred at the
Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant site.
My name is Dr. Brian Sheron, and I have been the Director of the
NRC Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research for the past five years and
have been at the NRC and its predecessor agency, the Atomic Energy
Commission, for nearly 38 years.
The following testimony is intended to provide an overview of the
NRC's Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) and its current
activities, as well as provide a discussion of the agency task force
and research activities related to the Fukushima-Daiichi event in
Japan.
As you are aware, the NRC is an independent Federal agency
established to license and regulate the Nation's civilian use of
production and utilization facilities, as well as the use of byproduct,
source, and special nuclear materials to ensure adequate protection of
public health and safety, to promote the common defense and security,
and to protect the environment. The NRC currently licenses, inspects,
and assesses the performance of 104 operating nuclear power plants, as
well as many materials licensees, fuel cycle facilities, and research
and test reactors.
The Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (or RES) is a major NRC
program office, mandated by Congress and created along with the NRC in
1975. RES is one of the offices that reports to the Executive Director
for Operations. RES plans, recommends, and implements programs of
nuclear regulatory research, standards development, and resolution of
generic safety issues for nuclear power plants and other facilities
regulated by the NRC. The Office coordinates research activities within
and outside the agency, including NRC participation in national and
international volunteer standards efforts. There are currently about
260 staff members in the office, which is organized into three
technical divisions: the Division of Engineering, Division of Risk
Analysis, and Division of Systems Analysis.
RES is responsible for developing methods, technical expertise and
computer codes that are used by the NRC to assess safety and regulatory
issues for materials licensees, fuel cycle facilities, operating
reactors as well as new and advanced reactor designs. We develop the
data needed to assess these codes by conducting experiments at national
laboratories, universities, or in collaboration with international
organizations.
The NRC regulatory research program addresses issues in the three
arenas of nuclear reactors, nuclear materials, and radioactive waste.
The research program is designed to improve the agency's knowledge
where uncertainty exists, where safety margins are not well-
characterized, and where regulatory decisions need to be confirmed in
existing or new designs and technologies. Typically, the regulatory
offices approach us with an issue, and we determine how to
appropriately resolve it through research or analysis. The majority of
our work is this user need driven work performed in response to
requests from our regulatory offices, as shown in the following chart:

RES coordinates research activities with the other NRC program
offices, as appropriate, and leads the agency's initiative for
cooperative research with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and other
Federal agencies, the domestic nuclear industry, U.S. universities, and
international partners. RES coordinates the development of consensus
and voluntary standards for agency use, including appointment of agency
staff to various standards committees. Based on research results and
experience gained, we work with the regulatory offices to develop
appropriate regulatory actions to resolve potential safety issues for
nuclear power plants and other facilities regulated by the NRC,
including those issues designated as Generic Issues (GIs). GIs are
technical or security issues that could impact two or more facilities
or licensees. RES also develops the technical basis for those areas
regulated by the NRC that have risk-informed, performance-based
regulations.
RES supplies technical tools, analytical models, and experimental
data needed to support the agency's regulatory decisions. RES does not
conduct research for the primary purpose of developing improved
technologies, a function that is more appropriately that of the
Department of Energy or the nuclear industry. Rather, the NRC conducts
research to confirm that the methods and data generated by the industry
ensure that adequate safety margin is maintained.
In addition to supporting regulation of the commercial use of
radioactive materials to protect public health and safety and to
protect the environment, RES is responsible for providing the technical
basis for regulations to ensure the protection and safeguarding of
nuclear materials and nuclear power plants in the interest of national
security. Thus, while its primary focus is on supporting the licensing
and regulatory process, the research conducted by and for the NRC plays
an important role in supporting broad government-wide initiatives
associated with national security.
The Office of Research's staff is very well qualified and educated,
with 30% of staff holding PhDs, and 33% of staff with master's degrees.
The staff continues to reflect diversity in education, demographics,
and technical disciplines. The wide range of engineering and scientific
disciplines includes expertise in nuclear engineering, materials
science, human factors and human reliability, health physics, fire
protection, and probabilistic risk assessment, to name a few. It is
this diversity in highly technical and specialized disciplines that
allows RES to support the licensing offices as they carry out their
licensing and regulatory tasks. Given this internal expertise, we
perform a significant amount of research in-house. However, because we
have more work than RES staff's capacity, we use contractors to
supplement our work to perform research that requires special skills or
facilities. Our staff develops the work plan and is engaged in the
research process with the contractor throughout the entire research
effort.
In addition to conducting confirmatory research, RES also conducts
forward-looking research. The objectives of forward-looking and long-
term research are to develop the technical basis to support related
regulatory decision making. We monitor areas where the regulated
industry may be moving and determine the technical information needed
for future regulatory decisions to prepare the agency to respond to
anticipated future industry requests and initiatives.
These activities address new safety technologies or developments in
analytical technologies or infrastructure. By their nature, these items
span a wide range of disciplines, from risk assessment to structural
integrity to fission product transport. Our development of data and
assessment tools for these technologies will ensure that the agency is
prepared to meet its future regulatory needs.
In addition to our research efforts, the NRC cooperates with
professional organizations that develop voluntary consensus standards
associated with systems, structures, equipment, or materials used by
the nuclear industry. In fiscal year 2010, 184 NRC staff members
participated in 325 standards activities, such as membership on a
standards-writing committee. The organizations governing these
committees include the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME),
the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), the American Nuclear
Society, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the
American Concrete Institute, and the National Council on Radiation
Protection and Measurements.
For example, ASME developed the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and
the Operations and Management Code which are widely acknowledged as an
acceptable set of standards used to design, construct, and inspect
pressure-retaining components, including nuclear vessels, piping,
pumps, and valves. Similarly, NFPA has developed consensus standards to
define acceptable methods to design, install, inspect, and maintain
fire protection systems. The NRC has incorporated into its regulations
various standards from the groups discussed above.
The NRC's use of voluntary consensus standards is consistent with
statutory requirements. Participation by the NRC staff in voluntary
consensus standards development is essential because the codes and
standards are an integral part of the agency's regulatory framework.
The benefits of this active involvement include cost savings, improved
efficiency and transparency, and regulatory requirements of high
technical quality. The agency acknowledges the broad range of technical
expertise and experience of the individuals who belong to the many
consensus standards organizations. Thus, participation in standards
development minimizes the expenditure of NRC resources that would
otherwise be necessary to provide guidance with the technical depth and
level of detail of voluntary consensus standards.
Over the past 35 years, RES has developed or sponsored over 40
computer codes for use in its safety analyses. These codes are used in
many aspects of the NRC's mission and perform wide ranging tasks
including modeling fuel and reactor systems behavior, radiation's
health effects, atmospheric dispersion, probabilistic risk assessment
and more. They are shared with domestic and international counterparts
to capture the value of a larger expert user community, which adds
robustness to the codes and certainty to their results.
NRC uses computer codes to model and evaluate fuel behavior,
reactor kinetics, thermal-hydraulic conditions, severe accident
progression, time-dependent dose for design-basis and beyond design-
basis accidents, health effects, and radionuclide release and transport
during various operating and postulated accident conditions. Computer
codes are validated against scaled tests and actual plan data. Results
from such code applications support regulatory decision making in risk-
informed activities, confirmatory and exploratory analyses, review of
licensees' codes, performance of audit calculations, and resolution of
other technical issues to inform the NRC staff on a wide variety of
emergent technical questions for ensuring the health and safety of the
general public. NRC code development is focused on improving the
realism, accuracy and reliability of code results while improving code
usability. However, the modeling of some novel systems (e.g., medical
isotopes production) and new and advanced reactor design (e.g., Next
Generation Nuclear Plant) requires further code development and
additional assessment against specific experimental data.
Some specific examples of codes and how they are more specifically
used in the regulatory environment are the MELCOR and MACCS2 codes. The
MELCOR code models the progression of severe accidents in light-water
nuclear power reactors. MELCOR models several phenomena including
thermal-hydraulics, core heatup, containment performance, hydrogen
production, and fission product release and transport behavior. The
MACCS2 code is used to evaluate doses and health risks from the
accidental atmospheric releases of radio nuclides. It is also used to
confirm license renewal analyses regarding plant specific evaluation of
Severe Accident Mitigation Alternatives (SAMAs) that is required as
part of the environmental assessment for license renewal. The MACCS2
code is also routinely used in environmental impact statements (EIS)
supporting early site permits (ESP).
The agency shares its codes with other organizations under various
agreements and has organized user groups for some codes that are widely
used. Two such programs are the Code Applications and Maintenance
Program (CAMP) and the Cooperative Severe Accident Research Program
(CSARP). CAMP, which has existed as a user community for almost 30
years, includes thermal-hydraulic codes, and has members from more than
25 nations. CSARP includes members from 20 nations who focus on the
analysis of severe accidents using primarily the MELCOR code. Through
the CAMP and CSARP programs, the NRC is able to share some of the
codes' development and maintenance cost, while improving their quality
and performance.
RES has implemented over 100 international cooperative agreements
with other nuclear regulators and international organizations to share
information and leverage resources. RES also participates in several
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA)
committees and working groups that develop safety standards and
facilitate the exchange of information between countries on topics such
as risk assessment, events and best practices. These include the IAEA
Nuclear Safety Standards Committee, the Committee on the Safety of
Nuclear Installations, the Working Group on Risk Assessment, and
others. In addition, I serve as vice-Chair for the Committee on the
Safety of Nuclear Installations at the OECD/NEA.
The NRC has a robust reactor operating experience program, and we
have taken advantage of the lessons learned from previous operating
experience to implement a program of continuous improvement for the
U.S. reactor fleet. We have learned from experience across a wide range
of situations, including, most significantly, the Three Mile Island
(TMI) accident in 1979. As a result of those lessons learned, we
significantly revised emergency planning requirements and emergency
operating procedures for licensees, and made substantive improvements
in NRC's incident response capabilities. We also addressed many human
factors issues regarding control room indicators and layouts, added new
requirements for hydrogen control to help prevent explosions inside of
containment, and created requirements for enhanced control room
displays of the status of pumps and valves.
Two particularly significant changes after TMI accident were the
expansion of the Resident Inspector Program and the incident response
program. Today, there are at least two Resident Inspectors at each
nuclear power plant. The inspectors have unfettered access to all
licensees' activities, and serve as NRC's eyes and ears at the power
plant. The NRC headquarters operations center and regional incident
response centers are prepared to respond to all emergencies, including
any resulting from operational events, security events, or natural
phenomena. Multidisciplinary teams in these centers have access to
detailed information regarding licensee facilities, and access to plant
status information through telephonic links with the Resident
Inspectors, an automated emergency response data system, and directly
from the licensee over the emergency notification system. NRC's
response would include the dispatch of a site team to supplement the
Resident Inspectors on site, and integration with the licensee's
emergency response organization at their Emergency Offsite Facility.
The program is designed to provide independent assessment of events, to
ensure that appropriate actions are taken to mitigate the events, and
to ensure that State officials have the information they would need to
make decisions regarding protective actions.
The NRC had a Boiling Water Reactor Mark I Containment Improvement
Program in the 1990's, which resulted in the installation of hardened
vent systems for containment pressure relief, as well as enhanced
reliability of the automatic depressurization system.
As a result of the events of September 11, 2001, we identified
important pieces of equipment that, regardless of the cause of a
significant fire or explosion at a plant, we want licensees to have
available and staged in advance, as well as new procedures, training
requirements, and policies that would help deal with a severe
situation.
As you know, on Friday, March 11, 2011, an earthquake and
subsequent tsunami occurred near the northeast coast of Japan,
resulting in the shutdown of more than 10 reactors. From what we know
now, it appears possible that the reactors' response to the earthquake
went according to design. The ensuing tsunami, however, likely caused
the loss of emergency alternating current (AC) power to four of the six
units at the Fukushima Daiichi site. It is these four units that have
received the majority of our attention since that time. Units One, Two,
and Three at the site were in operation at the time of the earthquake.
Units Four, Five, and Six were in previously scheduled outages.
Our program of continuous improvement based on operating experience
will include evaluation of the significant events in Japan and what we
can learn from them. We have already begun enhancing inspection
activities through temporary instructions to our inspection staff,
including the Resident Inspectors at each nuclear power plant and the
region-based inspectors in our four Regional offices, to look at
licensees' readiness to deal with both the design basis accidents and
the beyond-design basis accidents. The information that we gather will
be used for additional evaluation of the industry's readiness for
similar events, and will aid in our understanding of whether additional
regulatory actions need to be taken in the immediate term.
The phenomena associated with the events at Fukushima-Daiichi
involve numerous disciplines in which RES has expertise and are in
areas where we have already done substantial analysis. I would now like
to discuss some of these technical areas that have been raised since
the events in Japan and discuss our related existing or planned
research activities.
First, the NRC has an extensive seismic research program. Seismic
safety in the design and operation of nuclear facilities has been
evolving since the development of the first rules and guidance for
seismic design by the NRC's predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission.
In 1998, the NRC issued a policy decision to move towards a risk-
informed and performance-based regulatory framework. Risk-informed
frameworks use probabilistic methods to assess not only what can go
wrong, but also the likelihood of going wrong. Over the last decade,
significant advances have been made in the ability to assess seismic
hazards. The NRC is currently sponsoring several projects in support of
both an updated assessment of seismic hazards in the Central and
Eastern United States (CEUS) and an enhancement of the overall
framework under which the hazard characterizations are developed. The
products of these projects will be used in the determination of seismic
hazard design levels for new reactors and are being used in a program
to reassess seismic hazards at existing plant locations. Although no
immediate safety issue has been identified, the NRC will take action if
our further analysis shows that safety improvements can be justified.
Since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, significant advances have been
made in the ability to assess tsunami hazard globally. The NRC
initiated its current tsunami research program in 2006. It focuses on
bringing the latest technical advances to the regulatory process and
exploring topics unique to nuclear facilities. The tsunami research
program focuses on several key areas: landslide-induced tsunami hazard
assessments, support activities associated with the licensing of new
nuclear power plants in the United States, development of probabilistic
methods, and development of the technical basis for new NRC guidance.
This program, which includes cooperative work with the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), has already resulted in several important
publications on tsunami hazard assessments on the Atlantic and Gulf
Coasts of the United States. The publications and research results help
form the basis of NRC review of new license applications. Whether
additional work is needed for operating reactors will also be examined.
The NRC has performed extensive research since the TMI accident to
understand the phenomena associated with severe accidents and has
developed analytical models that predict accident progressions and
their consequences. This research includes test programs on zirconium
fires, source term analysis, molten core-concrete interactions, and
containment analyses.
The NRC is conducting research to estimate the possible public
health and safety consequences in the unlikely event that a severe
accident occurs at a commercial nuclear power plant in the United
States. The State-of-the-Art Reactor Consequence Analysis (SOARCA)
program takes maximum advantage of extensive national and international
reactor safety research and reflects improved plant design, operation,
and accident management implemented over the past 25 years. Using
computer models and simulation tools, the NRC is developing a set of
realistic consequence estimates of accidents at two U.S. reactor sites
representative of different reactor and containment designs used in the
United States. The two pilot plants are a General Electric boiling-
water reactor (BWR) with a Mark I containment (Peach Bottom) and a
Westinghouse pressurized-water reactor (PWR) with a dry, sub-
atmospheric containment (Surry). The results of the analyses are
showing thus far that analyzed scenarios could reasonably be mitigated,
either preventing core damage or delaying or reducing the radiation
release. For cases assumed to proceed unmitigated, accidents appear to
progress more slowly than previously thought and usually result in
smaller and more delayed radiological releases than previously
predicted.
A Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) is a structured analytical
process that provides estimates of risk by (1) identifying potential
initiating event scenarios that can challenge system operations, (2)
estimating the likelihood of event sequences that lead to an adverse
event such as core damage, containment failure, and offsite
radiological effects; and (3) estimating the consequences associated
with accident sequences. These rankings are very valuable in the sense
that resources can be directed towards the major contributors to risk.
There are three levels of PRA for nuclear power plants. Level 1 PRA
covers the initiating event to the onset of core damage. Level 2 PRA
covers the onset of core damage to radioactive material release to the
environment. Level 3 PRA covers radioactive material release to offsite
radiological consequences.
The first study to use PRA methods to obtain more realistic
estimates of risk associated with severe reactor accidents was
completed in 1975. In 1988 the NRC asked the licensees to conduct
Individual Plant Examinations to ensure that NRC's regulations were
adequate and no undue risk was posed to the public by any plant. In
1990, NRC completed a Level 3 PRA for five commercial nuclear power
plants of different reactor and containment designs. Since this last
NRC-sponsored Level 3 PRA, the design, operation, maintenance, testing,
and inspection of NPPs and the state-of-the-art in PRA technology, and
data have evolved considerably. Our staff therefore continues to
improve NRC's PRA capability and risk understanding to enhance PRAs
role in NRC's current risk-informed regulatory approach.
The NRC has developed independent confirmatory PRA models for
operating and new reactor nuclear plants. The NRC maintains
Standardized Plant Analysis Risk (SPAR) models that represent the 104
operating commercial plants in addition to 2 SPAR models for new
reactor designs. These SPAR models are used to support a variety of NRC
regulated activities including the reactor oversight and the accident
precursor programs. The SPAR models are updated periodically to reflect
plant modifications, new operating experience data, and improved risk
modeling capabilities (e.g., support system initiating events, external
hazards, and loss of offsite power).
As part of the PRA program, the NRC conducts human reliability
analysis (HRA) research to assess the human contribution to risk. We
study human performance because it can significantly influence the
reliability and safety of nuclear plant operations. HRA research is key
to understanding accident sequences and appropriately representing
their relative importance to overall risk. Research is conducted both
domestically and internationally in cooperation with other
organizations. In addition, the NRC participates in and I am the Board
Chairman of the OECD/NEA Halden Reactor Project. Halden is a research
facility in Norway that advances HRA through research. Several
regulatory agencies and private sector companies participate in Halden
research activities. NRC continues to study human performance in
nuclear power plants and improve the methods for assessing human
reliability.
Another PRA based program that measures risk is the Accident
Sequence Precursor (ASP) Program. The NRC established ASP in 1979 after
the TMI accident. The ASP Program systematically evaluates U.S. nuclear
power plant operating experience to identify, document, and rank the
operating events most likely to lead to inadequate core cooling and
severe core damage (precursors), given the likelihood of additional
failures.
The ASP Program provides (1) a comprehensive, risk-informed view of
nuclear power plant operating experience and a measure for trending
core damage risk; (2) a partial check on dominant core damage scenarios
predicted by probabilistic risk assessments; and (3) provides feedback
to regulatory activities. The NRC also uses the ASP Program to monitor
performance against the safety goal established in the agency's
strategic plan and report significant precursors to Congress.
The NRC has previously studied spent fuel pool (SFP) issues and
modified licensee requirements in various areas such as an aircraft
impact assessment, loss of SFP cooling, modifications to assembly
configurations, and additional requirements following the attacks of
September 11, 2001. As a result of the recent events in Japan, an
updated SFP safety study to estimate the relative consequences of
removing older fuel from the SFP and placing it into dry storage versus
leaving it in the spent fuel pool is being considered.
Beyond the initial steps to address the experience from the events
in Japan, the NRC staff has established a senior level agency task
force to conduct a methodical and systematic review of our regulatory
processes to determine whether the agency should make any improvements
to our regulatory system and to make recommendations to the Commission
for its policy direction. This activity will have both near-term and
longer-term objectives.
For the near-term effort, we have started a 90-day review. This
review will evaluate the currently available information from the
Japanese events to identify immediate or near-term operational or
regulatory issues potentially affecting the 104 operating reactors in
the United States, including their spent fuel pools. Areas of
investigation will include: the ability to protect against natural
disasters; response to station blackouts; severe accidents and spent
fuel accident progression; and severe accident management issues. Over
this 90-day period, the task force will develop recommendations, as
appropriate, for changes to inspection procedures and licensing review
guidance, and recommend whether generic communications, orders, or
additional regulations are needed.
This 90-day effort includes a briefing to the Commission after
approximately 30 days to provide a snapshot of the regulatory response
and the condition of the U.S. fleet based on information it has
available at that time. This briefing, which occurred on May 12, also
ensured that the Commission is both kept informed of ongoing efforts
and prepared to resolve any policy recommendations that surface.
However, over the 90-day and longer-term efforts the task force will
seek additional stakeholder input. At the end of the 90-day period, a
report will be provided to the Commission and to the public in
accordance with normal Commission processes, and it will be provided to
the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards for its review. The task
force's longer-term review will begin as soon as the NRC has sufficient
technical information from the events in Japan.
The task force will evaluate all technical and policy issues
related to the event to identify additional potential research, generic
issues, changes to the reactor oversight process, rulemakings, and
adjustments to the regulatory framework that should be pursued by the
NRC. The task force is also expected to evaluate potential interagency
issues, such as emergency preparedness, and examine the applicability
of any lessons learned to non-operating reactors and materials
licensees. The task force is expected to seek input from stakeholders
during this process. A report with appropriate recommendations will be
provided to the Commission within 6 months of the start of this
evaluation. Both the 90-day and final reports will be made publicly
available in accordance with our regulatory decision making. The NRC
has expertise in a multitude of technical disciplines and has performed
significant research in the past related to reactors, materials, and
waste. In light of the events in Japan, the NRC has initiated a near-
term evaluation of the events' relevance to the U.S. nuclear power
plants, and we are continuing to gather the information necessary for
us to take a longer, more thorough look at the events and their lessons
for us. Based on the lessons learned from these efforts, we will pursue
additional regulatory actions and research, as needed, to ensure the
continuing safety of the U.S. fleet.

STATEMENT OF MR. LAKE BARRETT, PRINCIPAL, L. BARRETT
CONSULTING, LLC

Mr. Barrett. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Ms.
Edwards, and Chairman Hall. I appreciate the opportunity to be
here before you today.
I would like to just quickly try to go through what
happened at Fukushima-Daiichi plant. It is a large, six reactor
facility on the northeast coast of Japan. On March 11, there
was a huge earthquake. The earthquake was slightly beyond the
design basis of the plant, but the safety systems all performed
satisfactorily there. There was a greater-than-designed basis
tsunami, a huge wave that surrounded the plant as you can see
in the lower right-hand corner, and when it hit, it took out
all the emergency A/C power in the plant. They were able to
cool the core for about eight hours using a backup system that
was operated with batteries. After about eight hours the
battery power exhausted and there was no more cooling, and the
core started to uncover and overheat. As the core overheated,
it started to melt and there was a steam cloud interaction
producing hydrogen. This led to an over-pressurization. The
primary containment was vented to the secondary containment and
there was hydrogen gas in that. That led to an explosion in the
Unit 1 building, and then there was another explosion in the
Unit 3 building.
Units 1, 2, and 3 were operating at the time of the
earthquake and tsunami. The operators started to inject
seawater to cool the core and through the feed and bleed
operation, and they are doing that to this day now. They are
working to restore recirculation cooling. They also have had to
spray water up onto the spent fuel pools, which are in the
upper areas, with fire trucks in the beginning. They now have
an injection boom with a concrete injection pump.
Thirty years ago at Three Mile Island there was another
accident that had core degradation also. There were entirely
different reasons for the accident at Three Mile Island. It was
the Unit 2 reactor which is in the foreground on this photo. At
Three Mile Island, it was an operator misunderstanding of the
reactor system. There was an abnormal shutdown and a valve
stuck open. The operators thought it was closed and the
operators thought there was too much water in the reactor, when
in reality there was not enough. They turned off the emergency
pumps and this led to the core being overheated. It melted
approximately a little over half of the core. This is what I
expect we will find at Fukushima when they eventually get
inside. Hydrogen gas was generated. The hydrogen gas did have a
deflagration event, but it was contained primarily within the
reactor building. There was about a half a million gallons of
highly radioactive water on the floor of the containment
building. This would be a sequence of how the core would melt
and redistribute down toward the bottom of the vessel, which
again, as reported last night from Japan, is a situation like
in Unit 1.
At Three Mile Island, sophisticated clean up systems were
installed, and the spent fuel pool, which was empty. Special
refueling tools were built and damaged fuel, the damaged fuel
was placed in canisters. This was safely completed in about a
decade, cost about $1 billion and about 3 million gallons of
highly radioactive water was processed.
At Fukushima, they are still stabilizing the plant. It is
not stable yet. They are looking to establish clean areas. They
are working to mitigate the airborne releases, which are
unmonitored. They are working to capture the 10-plus million
gallons of highly radioactive water that is in the plant, and
gain access. This is just an old picture of the four reactors
that are severely damaged at Fukushima, another side angle
where you can see some of the vapors coming off probably the
spent fuel pools and the reactors, which are located down in
the lower parts of the buildings. They are taking mitigative
actions to mitigate the airborne effluents such as spraying
resins and fixatives on the contaminated soil on the plant
site. There is also the work to contain the tens of millions of
gallons of highly radioactive water. They have robotic
equipment trying to remove the highly radioactive debris from
the site so they can gain access to the buildings inside. There
is offsite contamination, but it is not that severe, but
nonetheless it significant.
My observations on Fukushima: it is not a public health
catastrophe, it certainly is an industrial plant catastrophe.
The tsunami was the critical safety matter. I think Units 1 and
4 are a complete loss, but the cleanup, I believe, can be done.
The technology is there. We had it 30 years ago at Three Mile
Island, and it is much better today than it was back then. The
Japanese have a strong technological society, and I believe
they can handle this in the future, but they still have
challenges. As far as U.S. plants, I believe they have adequate
safety margins today. The tsunami risk was the main issue for
safety. That is primarily limited to the northwest coast of the
United States. We have no operating reactors there on the
coast, but there are two shut down reactors that have spent
fuel that is stored there, and that is a risk that probably
shouldn't be there. But it is a small risk because it is in dry
storage.
The United States has done a lot of work in severe response
improvements over past decades, and I think that is a good
basis for the United States, but we need to have a systematic,
methodical risk informed, lessons learned evaluation. The
industry is doing it, and so is the NRC. We should resist quick
fix, emotional reactions to this until we get the facts and
learn what has happened and what is the right course of action.
The lessons learned from Three Mile Island greatly improved
U.S. nuclear safety and productivity. The most painful lessons
are the most teachable lessons, and we had very painful lessons
at Three Mile Island and we are undergoing one now with
Fukushima. I believe history will probably look back, if we
keep on a steady course, that Fukushima will improve our entire
energy situation, improve safety and performance for the
future, just like Three Mile Island did 30 years ago.
Thank you very much.

L. Barrett Consulting, LLC, follows:]
Prepared Statement of Mr. Lake Barrett, Principal of L. Barrett
Consulting, LLC
Chairman Broun, Chairman Harris, Ranking Member Edwards, and
Ranking Member Miller, good morning and I am honored to appear before
you today to present my views on the events surrounding the incident at
the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactors in Japan, the current status of
reactor safety in the United States, and how the events at Fukushima
can inform policies and technology advancement to improve safety and
risk management for nuclear facilities. I am presenting my views as a
private person in the context of my experience as the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission Site Director in charge of recovery and cleanup
at Three Mile Island.
On March 11, 2011 a subduction slip fault, where the Pacific plate
slides under the Japan plate, snapped and released a tremendous amount
of energy causing a massive 9.0 earthquake that shocked the north east
coast of Japan. The earthquake caused a massive. tsunami that hit the
coast approximately one hour after the earthquake. This was reported as
the largest earthquake to hit Japan in over the last 1,000 years. The
earthquake and tsunami caused immense destruction throughout northern
Japan destroying entire towns and killing over 20,000 persons with
early damage estimates of over $300 billion.
The massive earthquake took down the northern Japan power grid
causing the operating major power plants in the region to automatically
shutdown. The Fukushima Daiichi power reactor complex was impacted by
the earthquake and the three operating reactors there safely shutdown.
Although the earthquake dynamic loading was reportedly slightly above
the seismic design basis of the facility, there was no reported damage
to safety systems and the shutdown appeared to function normally
despite the massive earthquake. The emergency diesels started as
designed and there was no reported significant structural damage to
safety systems.
Approximately one hour after the earthquake, a massive 15 meter
high tsunami hit the Fukushima Daiichi site and overwhelmed the tsunami
protections that had a reportedly nominal design basis of 5.7 meters
with the major facility buildings located approximately 10 meters high.
This ultra high ``mega'' tsunami flooded all the emergency diesels,
swept away their fuel supplies, and destroyed much of the electrical
switch gear. This complete loss of AC power and destruction of
electrical components resulted in an extended ``station blackout''
situation.
With the loss of all AC electric power, reactor Units 1, 2, and 3,
which had automatically shutdown, were then cooled by their DC battery
controlled backup cooling systems: an isolation condenser for the older
Unit 1 reactor and the steam turbine driven Reactor Core Isolation
Cooling system pumps at the newer larger Units 2 and 3. After
approximately 8 hours these backup systems apparently failed and thus
the operators were unable to remove the decay heat from the reactor
cores. The operators and government officials declared a site emergency
and initiated a phased evacuation and sheltering order in areas
surrounding the site with a 30 KM radius.
With the loss of cooling, the reactor primary coolant system water
in the reactor core started to boil away and increase the primary
coolant system pressure. This led to either an automatic opening of the
system overpressure protection relief valves or manual opening of the
valves to relieve primary system pressure by releasing steam to the
primary containment suppression pool in the basement of the reactor
building, The continued loss of coolant lowered the reactor vessel
water level such that the core became uncovered, but was bathed in
superheated steam, With this loss of cooling water, the fuel cladding
temperatures increased significantly until the zirconium alloy rods
that encase the uranium fuel pellets over heated, became over
pressurized, and likely burst As the temperatures further increased
there was a chemical reaction between the zirconium alloy cladding
material and the superheated steam, The chemical reaction was an
oxidation of the zirconium metal by the oxygen in the steam which
produced additional heat and also hydrogen gas, This release of
additional gas and energy into the primary coolant system led to
further over pressurization of the primary coolant system which in turn
led to further release of steam, which now contained hydrogen and noble
gas fission products, into the suppression pool and primary
containment.
Since there were no cooling systems available to cool the primary
containment system suppression pool, the water temperature of the
suppression pool began to rise past the boiling point and the primary
containment system pressure began to rise, At some point, likely around
5 atmospheres of pressure, the primary containment system was in danger
of over pressurizing toward a possible structural failure, Although I
do not know exactly what happened at this point, it appears that the
operators manually released pressure from the primary containment to
prevent a failure of the primary containment system, They were likely
trying to vent the steam, hydrogen, and fission product gas mixture
through filters and up the 100 meter ventilation stack, However, for
some unknown reasons, there may have been leaks in the system or they
may have intentionally vented the gas mixture into the reactor building
(which serves as a secondary containment) trying to minimize releases
of radioactive materials to the environment Regardless of the operator
actions, the hydrogen gas apparently mixed with oxygen rich natural air
in the reactor building resulting in an explosive gas mixture within
the reactor building,
Some unknown ignition source ignited the explosive gas mixture
resulting in the destruction of the roof and upper sides of the Unit 1
and Unit 3 reactor buildings, As expected, the hot gases rose toward
the top of the reactor building doing the most damage to the upper
areas, The primary containment system boundary in the lower levels of
these reactor buildings seemed to not be seriously compromised and
seemed to maintain their ability to contain and scrub fission products
from hot radioactive effluents venting from the primary coolant system,
Although no details are yet available on specific mitigation
actions that the operators were taking to cool the reactor cores and
mitigate the release of radioactive releases, there was one heroic
effort apparently made to prevent a hydrogen explosion in Unit 2
reactor building, The operators went into the Unit 2 reactor building
and removed a side wall panel to allow hydrogen gas to naturally
diffuse into the environment before it could build up to explosive
levels and ignite, There was however, a reported explosion in the lower
regions of the Unit 2 reactor building that likely damaged the primary
containment; however information as to the situation there is not yet
available,
Portable diesel power generators and fire engine pumps were brought
into the site as soon as possible, however, the huge extent of
earthquake and tsunami damage to the local area was a major delaying
factor.
Eventually the operators were able to connect the fire truck pumps
to directly inject seawater into the reactor cores of Units 1, 2 and 3
to start removing decay heat from the cores, thus likely preventing
further core overheating and damage, Unfortunately, considerable damage
was already done to the cores, but with the seawater and later
freshwater injection to the cores, the situation seems to have
stabilized.
At the time of the earthquake and tsunami the Unit 4 reactor was
shut down for maintenance with its reactor core removed from the
reactor vessel and placed in its spent fuel pool. Several days after
the earthquake and tsunami there was one or more major explosions in
the Unit 4 reactor building. At this point, I do not know the source of
explosion energy. At an early time, it was theorized that the Unit 4
spent fuel pool may have overheated, but recent water samples from the
Unit 4 pool do not indicate major fuel damage. So at this point, more
information is necessary to determine what happened in Unit 4.
Although information is very sketchy, it seems based on water
samples taken, there has been damage to spent fuel that is stored in
the Units 2 and 3 spent fuel pools. Information as to what happened in
these pools is still unavailable, so it is impossible to determine the
significance at this time, but it certainly appears that something of
significance occurred. Once information becomes available, a careful
analysis should determine what happened and what are the appropriate
lessons learned regarding spent fuel pool storage safety.
The U.S. Three Mile Island Unit 2 (TMI) accident back on the
morning of March 28,1979 resulted in similar reactor core overheating
and core damage similar to what has now happened to the cores in the
Fukushima Units 1,2 and 3. The TMI accident led to localized core
melting, hydrogen generation and release of radioactive materials from
the reactor core, but for entirely different reasons. Although the
physical core degradation mechanisms were similar for TMI and
Fukushima, I expect that the primary safety lessons learned will be
different because of different circumstances involved.
At Three Mile Island there was no natural catastrophe as at
Fukushima. It was a major man-machine interface problem when, during an
abnormal reactor shutdown, the reactor operators were not aware of a
stuck open pressurizer relief valve, which had a faulty valve position
indicator, resulting in the operators believing that there was too much
water in the reactor when actually there was not enough. The operators
stopped automatic water injection when they should not have done so.
The lack of water injection led to the core becoming uncovered and
grossly overheating. As in the Fukushima cores, the fuel cladding
burst, chemically reacted with superheated steam, released hydrogen gas
and melted approximately 50% of the reactor core. Again, as at
Fukushima, the TMI primary coolant system over pressurized and
radioactive steam, hydrogen gas, and radioactive fission products were
released into the TMI reactor containment building. The hydrogen gas
mixed with the oxygen in the air inside the TMI containment building
and ignited in a deflagration burn wave pressure spike that was fully
contained within the primary containment. At TMI there was no breach of
the primary containment system.
Once the TMI operators realized what the reactor situation was,
cooling water was immediately added and a sustainable core cooling
function was restored later on the first day by operating the large
main coolant pumps. Decay heat was then removed through the steam
generators until cold shutdown was achieved.
The operation of the main coolant pumps required some highly
contaminated primary coolant to be circulated into the Auxiliary
Building which led to some radioactive gases being released into the
Auxiliary Building ventilation system. Virtually all significant
releases were contained within the reactor containment building.
There were approximately two and one half million gallons of highly
radioactive water generated during the accident and recovery that
needed to be cleaned up. All the accident related water was contained
on site and special water processing systems were built to remove the
radioactive fission products, primarily Cesium and Strontium.
Eventually the processed accident water was safely discharged by
evaporation.
The stabilization and cleanup of TMI took approximately a decade
and cost approximately one billion dollars. Building accesses had to be
established, ventilation system improvements made, high radiation areas
mitigated, radioactive water removed, buildings decontaminated,
building infrastructures (e.g. cranes) restored, access to the damaged
reactor cores accomplished, special defueling systems deployed,
packaging of damaged fuel and other highly radioactive waste products
completed, temporary onsite storage facilities constructed, and
eventual offsite shipment of the damaged fuel and radioactive wastes
for lessons learned research and development accomplished. This was
safely achieved with virtually no offsite environmental impacts.
There were no radioactive injuries or adverse health effects from
the Three Mile Island accident and cleanup. Inadequate operator
response to deficient control room instrumentation proved to be the
root cause of the accident. The primary lessons learned from TMI was
that a much better integration of the operator's understanding of the
reactor systems was needed during off normal events. Major industry
wide improvements were instituted which included creation of the
Institute of Nuclear Power of Operations (lNPO) and risk informed
regulatory processes. Thus the TMI lessons learned responses led to
improved U.S. nuclear safety and improved reactor productivity.
It should be noted that the sister Three Mile Island Unit 1
reactor, which has a similar design to the damaged Unit 2, was
restarted after a thorough lessons learned review and continues to
operate safely today with one of the highest capacity factors in the
country.
I believe Fukushima is nearing the end of their initial
stabilization period and will hopefully soon be entering their
recovery/cleanup and lessons learned phases. They are working to
establish closed circuit core cooling for Units 1, 2 & 3 so that they
do not continue to create large quantities of highly radioactive water
containing fission products and continuing radioactive gas venting. In
addition, they are working to mitigate the releases of contaminated
water that has accumulated in all the reactor and turbine buildings by
installing new water storage tanks and processing systems. Airborne
releases are being mitigated by the installation of air filtration
systems and spraying of resin fixatives to onsite areas that were
highly contaminated by earlier airborne releases. Even though the
radioactive effluent mitigation challenges are great, I expect they
should be able to establish sufficient capability to minimize any
future significant radioactive releases from the site.
In summary, it is my view that the public health consequences of
the Fukushima accident should be infinitesimal when compared to the
impact of the earthquake and tsunami. From a radiological perspective,
this should be inconsequential from a national public health
perspective. There are some areas to the northwest where Cesium and
likely Strontium contamination has deposited and significant
remediation challenges will have to be addressed.
From an overall reactor safety perspective, I expect that there
will be much learned from Fukushima that will confirm present U.S.
safety margins and should also provide information to further improve
reactor safety in the coming years. The fundamental U.S. reactor safety
level that exists today is likely to be demonstrated as adequate
because there is a limited tsunami risk to most U.S. reactor
facilities. The only significant tsunami risk area in the U.S. is in
the Northwest Pacific coast where there are no exposed operating
reactors, but there are two shutdown reactor sites which have stranded
spent nuclear fuel in dry storage casks. In my view, I believe that all
stranded spent fuel at shutdown reactor sites should be removed to
completely eliminate `all radiological risks at these decommissioned
sites.
There are two other southern Pacific coast reactors, Diablo Canyon
and San Onofre; however, I expect that further reviews will confirm
there are adequate tsunami safeguards already in place at these sites
that should demonstrate adequate facility safety.
In the U.S. a lot of attention has already been placed on severe
accident mitigation over the last 25 years and especially since
September 11, 2001. Many safety improvements have already been made
which I believe will demonstrate that U.S. reactors are well prepared
to withstand severe accidents regardless of the initiating event. So
although a systematic methodical risk informed Fukushima lessons
learned evaluation should be performed and enhancing improvements
should be made, I expect that fundamental existing severe accident
safety margins will basically be confirmed.
I strongly recommend that the U.S. lessons learned process be
methodical, deliberate, risk informed and primarily led by private
industry. The independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission will do their
own safety reviews into the adequacy of their regulations with their
own lessons learned function. NRC and DOE nuclear research programs
should be adjusted as more is learned.
The NRC should resist political or emotional calls for quick
actions in one area or another until a thoughtful, fully informed
lessons learned analysis is completed based on facts and public health
and safety significance. Of course, if some immediate safety issue is
discovered requiring immediate action, the NRC has all the necessary
authority to act as necessary, but only when a clear significant safety
situation exists.
Three Mile Island lessons learned programs strengthened U.S.
nuclear energy in many different ways. The most painful lessons are
often the most teachable. Although we are just beginning to understand
the Fukushima lessons, I firmly believe that they will further
strengthen U.S. nuclear energy programs and other nuclear energy
programs throughout the world.

Chairman Broun. Thank you very much, Mr. Barrett. We have
been notified that we will be taking votes shortly, but what we
are going to do is we are going to hear from the last two
witnesses and then recess. We are going to go vote and we are
going to come back for questions.
So I now recognize our next witness, Dr. John Boice,
Scientific Director of the International Epidemiology
Institute.

STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN BOICE, SCIENTIFIC DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL
EPIDEMIOLOGY INSTITUTE

Dr. Boice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, ranking Members, and
Members of the Subcommittee. I am a radiation epidemiologist,
and I have spent my entire career studying populations exposed
to radiation, from Chernobyl cleanup workers to populations
living near nuclear power plants. I was in Hiroshima just a few
days before the accident as a member of the Science Council of
the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, reviewing the study
of atomic bomb survivors.
Fukushima is not like Chernobyl. The Chernobyl accident
resulted in massive radiation exposures. There was no
containment vessel, and a fire burned for 10 days, spewing
radioactive material into the environment. The first responders
and the fire fighters received so much radiation that 28 died
of acute radiation sickness within a few months. Radioactive
iodines were deposited on large areas, and were ingested by
grass-eating cows who gave milk that was drunk by children, and
an epidemic of thyroid cancer resulted.
In contrast, Fukushima appears to have resulted in
substantially lower worker and public exposures. The Japanese
authorities raised the annual limit of worker exposure from 2
to 25 rem, but only 21 workers received more than 10 rem. These
levels are far below the hundreds of rem needed to cause acute
radiation sickness, but they are sufficient to increase the
lifetime risk of developing cancer over their lifetimes by
about 1 percent.
Exposure to the public was minimal in large part because
the prevailing winds blew much of the radioactive releases
toward the ocean, and because of the actions taken by the
Japanese authorities. They evacuated people living within 20
kilometers of the Fukushima plant, and recommended that those
within 30 kilometers stay indoors to minimize exposure. They
monitored the food and water supplies, and banned the shipment
of foodstuffs and milk when the radiation levels exceeded
allowable standards. These protective measurements, including
the distribution of stable iodine pills or syrup for children
minimized public doses, and subsequently, there was unlikely to
be any or minimal health consequences. This is borne out in a
survey of over 1,000 children who had their thyroids measured
for possible uptakes of radioactive iodine. Not one child had a
measurement above normal. Nonetheless, some of the prevailing
winds did blow toward populated areas and these areas will be a
concern for remediation before allowing public access to
return.
Fukushima is 5,000 miles away from the United States, and
radiation is substantially diluted after traveling such a long
distance. The detection of trace amounts of radiation speaks
more about the sensitivity of our detectors than to the
possible consequences to public health. They pose no threat to
human health. They represent at most only a tiny fraction of
what we receive each day from daily sources of radiation.
The minute levels of radioactive iodine detected in milk in
Washington State were 5,000 times below the levels set by the
FDA to trigger concern. An infant would have to drink hundreds
of gallons of milk to receive a radiation dose equivalent to a
day's worth of natural background radiation exposure. These
trace levels are not a public health concern, and potassium
iodide tablets should not be taken as a preventive measure to
block the thyroid's uptake of such tiny levels. There are
potential adverse effects from taking these tablets, and these
risks have to be a balance against a non-existent benefit.
We live in a radioactive world. If I could have that first
slide?
[Slide]

In comparisons might help place the radiation levels from
Fukushima in context. Practically all the food we eat contains
small amounts of naturally occurring radioactive elements. We
breathe radioactive radon. Bricks and granite contain
radioactive materials that emit gamma radiation. The Capitol
building has some of the highest radiation levels in the United
States. Water contains small amounts of radioactive radium,
thorium, and uranium.
These examples are not to minimize the health consequences
of high and moderate exposures, but just to place in
perspective the tiny amounts from Fukushima which pose no
public health problems to the United States.
The Fukushima accident, however, highlights the need for
continued health research to fill important gaps in knowledge.
We know much about the effects of high levels of radiation when
received briefly, as was the case for the atomic bomb survivors
whose exposure was in less than a second. However, the level of
risk following exposures experienced gradually, over long
periods of time, are uncertain and remains the major unanswered
question in radiation epidemiology and risk assessment.
One untapped opportunity that should not be wasted is to
study our own U.S. radiation workers and veterans. The Low Dose
Radiation Program within the Department of Energy had the
foresight to provide seed money to evaluate the feasibility of
studying one million Americans, and this comprehensive work
should continue. The studied populations include Department of
Energy and Manhattan Project workers, atomic veterans who
participated in nuclear weapons tests, nuclear utility workers,
and others.
Thank you very much for this opportunity to appear before
you.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Boice follows:]
Prepared Statement of Dr. John Boice, Scientific Director,
International Epidemiology Institute
Good morning, Mr. Chairmen, ranking Members, and Members of the
Subcommittee. I am pleased to discuss the possible health implications
of radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident in
Japan. Just a few days before the natural disasters struck on March 11,
2011, I was in Hiroshima, Japan as a member of the Radiation Effects
Research Foundation's Science Council, reviewing the study of atomic
bomb survivors. I would like to begin by expressing my heartfelt
sympathy for the families of the tens of thousands who lost their lives
as a result of the tsunami and earthquake and for the hundreds of
thousands who have been displaced from their homes and livelihoods. The
health consequences associated with the radiation exposures emanating
from the Fukushima Daiichi plant pale in comparison.
As background, I am a radiation epidemiologist and Professor in the
Department of Medicine at Vanderbilt University and Scientific Director
of the International Epidemiology Institute. I have spent my career
studying human populations exposed to radiation, including Chernobyl
clean-up workers, patients receiving diagnostic and therapeutic
radiation, underground miners exposed to radon, nuclear energy workers,
atomic veterans, persons living in areas of high background radiation
and U.S. populations living near nuclear power plants and other
facilities. I am also a commissioner of the International Commission on
Radiological Protection, an emeritus member of the National Council on
Radiation Protection and Measurements, a U.S. delegate to the United
Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, and a
member of the Congressionally-mandated Veterans Advisory Board on Dose
Reconstruction.
My remarks will cover five areas:

Fukushima is not Chernobyl.

The health consequences for Japanese workers and public
appear to be minor.

The health consequences for United States citizens are
negligible to nonexistent.

We live in a radioactive world.

There is a pressing need to learn more about the health
consequences of radiation in humans when exposures are spread over time
at low levels and not received briefly at high doses such as in atomic
bomb survivors.

Fukushima is not Chernobyl [Slide 1]

The Chernobyl accident on April 26, 1986, resulted in massive
radiation exposures, both to the emergency workers putting out the
ensuing fire and to the environment. There was no containment vessel
and after the explosion a fire burned for ten days and spewed
radioactive particles continuously into the environment. The emergency
workers, the first responders and fire fighters, received so much
radiation that 28 of them died of acute radiation sickness within a few
months of exposure. Those who survived developed cataracts at a high
rate and several subsequently died of myelodysplastic disorders.
Radioactive iodines were deposited on large areas throughout the
Ukraine, Belarus and Russian Federation and were ingested by cows who
gave milk that was drunk by children, and an epidemic of thyroid cancer
ensued beginning about five years after the accident. Over 520,000
recovery workers were sent to clean up the environment and build the
so-called sarcophagus to contain the damaged nuclear reactor. To date
there is little conclusive evidence for adverse health effects
associated with radiation received during these clean-up operations.
There have, however, been indications of severe psychological stress
and increased rates of suicide.
In contrast, while the radiation releases from Fukushima [Slide 2]
are estimated to be up to 10% of that from Chernobyl, there appears to
be substantially less worker and public exposure. The Japanese
authorities relaxed the allowable annual limit of worker exposure from
2 to 25 rem for this emergency situation, but only about 21 workers
received more than 10 rem and only two workers received between 20 and
25 rem. These levels are far below the hundreds of rem needed to cause
acute radiation sickness. Those workers who experienced levels over 10
rem to their entire body, however, have an increased lifetime risk of
developing cancer of about 1-2% over the expected normal lifetime rate
of about 42%. There were reports of high radiation fields in the
vicinity of the damaged reactors and spent fuel storage ponds and with
the contaminated water, but apparently the Japanese authorities rotated
workers in such a way that cumulative exposures to individuals were
minimized. Three workers received beta particle exposures to their legs
from an estimated 200-300 rem to the skin, but the health consequences
of these localized exposures were minimal and resulted in only a
reddening of the skin.
Exposure to the public was minimal in large part because of the
prevailing winds and the quick action taken by the Japanese
authorities. The prevailing winds were generally to the east and over
the ocean and thus did not result in meaningful radiation exposures to
the Japanese public. In contrast to the circumstances around Chernobyl
where the authorities failed to alert or evacuate the surrounding
populations until several days had passed, the Japanese government
quickly evacuated persons living within 20 km of the Fukushima Daiichi
plant and recommended that those living within 30 km stay indoors to
minimize any possible exposure to radioactive releases. In addition,
they immediately monitored the food and water supplies and banned the
shipment of foodstuffs and milk where the radiation levels exceeded
allowable standards.
These protective action measures, including the distribution of
stable iodine pills (or syrup for children), minimized public doses and
suggest that there will be minimal health consequences associated with
any radiation exposures to the Japanese public. This is borne out in
one survey of over 1,000 children who had their thyroids measured for
possible uptakes of radioactive iodine. Not one child had a measurement
above detectable limits. This is in contrast to children living near
Chernobyl for whom large numbers had extremely high levels of
radioactive iodine detected in their thyroids from drinking
contaminated milk shortly after the accident.
Nonetheless, some of the prevailing winds did blow toward populated
areas shortly after the accident and during the hydrogen explosions,
and to the north-west in particular. Rain, snow and hail deposited
radioactive particles in certain regions, including some beyond 20 km,
and these areas will be a concern for remediation before allowing
public access or return. The Japanese authorities are considering
regular medical examinations for workers and inhabitants who received
more than 10 rem. To reduce anxiety, they are considering medical
check-ups for those who may have received between 2 to 10 rem. They are
also grappling with important issues as to when and how to allow
evacuated inhabitants to return to their homes. Childhood exposures are
of particular concern and topsoil is already being removed from some
school playgrounds.
Thus, while Fukushima is clearly a major reactor accident, the
potential health consequences associated with radiation exposures in
terms of loss of life and future cancer risk are small, particularly in
contrast with those resulting from the Chernobyl accident some 25 years
ago.
For completeness, the 1979 reactor accident at Three Mile Island
did not release appreciable amounts of radioactive substances into the
environment, and public and even worker exposures were minimal. The
average dose to people in the area was only about 1 millirem, or about
what would be received in three days from sources of natural background
radiation to the surrounding population.

The health consequences for United States citizens are negligible
to nonexistent. [Slide 2]

Fukushima is 5,000 miles away from the United States and the
radiation that has been detected was substantially diluted after
traveling such a long distance. The detection of trace amounts of
radiation speaks more about the potential health consequences from the
radiation itself. In addition to EPA's RadNet system that monitors
water, milk and the atmosphere, the Department of Energy has radiation
monitoring equipment that can detect minute quantities of radioactive
particles from the other side of the world as part of the Comprehensive
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The tiny amounts of detected radioactive
materials from Fukushima pose no threat to human health. They
represent, at most, only a tiny fraction of what we receive each day
from natural sources, such as the sun, the food we eat, the air we
breathe and the houses we live in.
It is impressive that radiation monitors can detect levels of
radioactive iodine-131 as low as 0.03 Bq/L (0.8 pCi/L) in milk in
Washington State; this is the decay of one radioactive atom per second
in about 33 gallons of milk. Such a level is 5,000 of times below the
Derived Intervention Level set by the Food and Drug Administration to
trigger concern over radionuclides in food. An infant would have to
drink hundreds of gallons of milk to receive a radiation dose
equivalent to a day's worth of natural background radiation exposure.
Such tiny levels of radiation are inconsequential compared with the
levels we experience in daily life.
Interestingly, the radiation monitoring stations in Washington
State had to detect radionuclides other than iodine-131 in order to
distinguish radiation from Fukushima from that at any local hospital in
the area. Most nuclear medicine departments use radioactive iodine for
imaging the thyroid and to treat thyroid diseases, and patients are
discharged shortly after intake and remain radioactive for several
months, releasing small but detectable levels of radioactive iodine
into the environment.
The trivial levels of radiation from Japan, while detectable,
should not be of a concern and Americans should not take stable iodine
(potassium iodide pills, KI) as a preventive measure to block the
thyroid's uptake of radioactive iodine. There are potential adverse
health effects from taking KI pills and these risks have to be balanced
against a nonexistent benefit.

We live in a radioactive world. [Slide 3]

To place the radiation levels from Fukushima in brief perspective,
it is important to recognize that we live in a radioactive world. A
banana, for example, has 10 Bq of activity, that is, 10 radioactive
potassium atoms decay every second. All the foodstuffs we eat that
contain potassium also contain a small amount of radioactive potassium,
a primordial element with a billion year half-life. There are no
concerns and no health consequences from such exposures.
We breathe radioactive radon which contributes over the year to
about 210 millirem of natural background radiation. Bricks and granite
contain radioactive materials that result in radiation exposures to the
public (20 millirem). The Capitol Building was constructed with granite
and is frequently cited as having some of the highest radiation levels
in all of the United States, about 85 millirem per year. Water contains
small amounts of radioactive radium, thorium and uranium, all within
allowable limits.
Not only do we live in a radioactive world, our bodies are
radioactive (30 millirem per year). Each second over 7,000 radioactive
atoms in our bodies decay and can irradiate those sitting next to us.
The atoms are largely radioactive potassium in our muscles and carbon-
14 in our tissues. The amount of radiation we receive each year from
medical sources (300 millirem), such as CT and medical imaging, equals
the amount received from natural sources (300 millirem). International
travel increases our exposure to cosmic rays and space radiation. A
roundtrip from Dulles to Tokyo would result in 20 millirem. Living in
Denver for a year results in 450 millirem of radiation dose, or 35%
more than the U.S. average of 310 millirem from natural sources. About
2.5 million Americans (0.8% of the population) receive more than 2,000
millirem per year from natural sources.
These examples are not to minimize the health consequences of high-
level exposures which are clearly demonstrable in human populations and
include acute radiation sickness at very high doses in excess of 200
rem and an increase in cancer at moderate doses above about 10 rem
(10,000 millirem). The examples do indicate, however, that we live in a
world of exposures to the U.S. population from Fukushima are tiny and
thousands of times below U.S. standards or guidelines where remedial
action would be triggered.

What research is needed? [Slide 4]

4Although we know much about the health effects of high levels of
radiation when received briefly, as was the case for atomic bomb
survivors, the risk following exposures experienced gradually over time
is uncertain and remains the major unanswered question in radiation
epidemiology.
One untapped opportunity is to study our own U.S. radiation workers
and veterans. The Low Dose Radiation Program within the Department of
Energy had the foresight to initiate pilot investigations of over one
million such workers and this comprehensive work should continue.
Cooperating agencies include the National Cancer Institute, the
Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and others. The study populations include early
DOE and Manhattan Project workers, atomic veterans who participated in
nuclear weapons testing in the 1940s and 1950s, nuclear utility
workers, medical workers and others involved in the development of
radiation technologies, as well as nuclear navy personnel.
Such a large study in the United States is critically important to
understand scientifically the health consequences of low-dose radiation
experienced over time and is directly relevant to the setting of
protection standards for workers and the public; the assessment of
possible risks from enhanced medical technologies such as CT and
nuclear medicine imaging; the expansion of nuclear power; the handling
of nuclear waste; the compensation of workers with prior exposures to
radiation; and even the possible consequences of the radiation released
from reactor accidents such as at Fukushima. To date, no direct study
of these issues has been exposures in 1945 have to be relied upon.

Summary [Slide 5]
Fortunately, the health consequences from the radiation releases
from the Fukushima Daiichi power plant appear to be minimal and are of
little importance with regard to the U.S. public. The Japanese
authorities acted quickly to evacuate over'200,000 inhabitants living
near the damaged reactors; they monitored food and water and took rapid
action to ban foodstuffs with increased radiation levels; they
distributed stable iodine pills and syrup; and they made measurements
on over 175,000 persons. The lasting effects upon the Japanese
population will most likely be psychological with increased occurrence
of stress-related mental disorders and depression associated not
necessarily with the concern about reactor radiation, but with the
horrific loss of life and disruption caused by the tsunami and
earthquake. There is a need for better public understanding and better
communications on the health effects of radiation exposures. Finally,
there is now the opportunity in the United States to learn directly
about low-dose, long-term radiation health effects by studying our
workers and veterans.
Thank you for this opportunity to testify. I welcome any questions
that you may have.

Mr. Lochbaum?

STATEMENT OF MR. DAVID LOCHBAUM, DIRECTOR, NUCLEAR SAFETY
PROJECT, UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS

Mr. Lochbaum. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member
Edwards, and other Members of the Subcommittees. On behalf of
the Union of Concerned Scientists, I appreciate this
opportunity to share our perspectives. My written testimony
describes lessons already evident from the Fukushima disaster
that are applicable to ensuring safer nuclear power plants in
the United States. This morning, I would like to focus on three
of those lessons.
The first lesson involves severe accident management
guidance. In NRC terminology, a severe accident involves some
fuel damage. The NRC and the nuclear industry representatives
have claimed that the severe accident management guidelines
developed after the Three Mile Island meltdown would protect us
from the problems faced at Fukushima. They have not been
telling the whole story. As broadcaster Paul Harvey used to
say, here is the rest of the story.
The entry for severe accident management guidelines in NRC
manual chapter 0308 states ``The staff concluded that regular
inspection was not appropriate because the guidelines are
voluntary and have no regulatory basis.'' The NRC never checks
the guidelines to determine if they might actually work under
severe accident conditions. From March 2009 until March 2010, I
worked for the NRC as an instructor at their technical training
center. My duties included teaching the severe accident
management guidelines to NRC employees. I and the other
instructors emphasized that NRC inspectors were not authorized
to evaluate the adequacy of the guidelines. Plant owners are
required to have the guidelines, while NRC inspectors are
required not to assess them.
If the NRC continues to rely on these guidelines to protect
public health, it must evaluate their effectiveness. It would
be too late and too costly to find out after a nuclear plant
disaster that the guidelines were missing a few key steps or
contained a handful of missteps.
The second lesson involves upgraded guidance for spent fuel
pool events. As I mentioned, the NRC and the nuclear industry
upgraded the procedures used by the operators during reactor
core accidents. The upgraded procedures provide the operators
with a full array of options available to deal with the reactor
core accident, not just those options relying on emergency
equipment. In addition, the upgraded procedures would help the
operators handle problems like unavailable or misleading
instrumentation readings. No such procedures and associated
training are available to help the operators deal with spent
fuel pool events. The NRC must require robust procedures for
spent fuel pool problems comparable to those available for
reactor core problems so that operators can prevent fuel damage
from occurring, or mitigate its consequences when those efforts
fail.
The last lesson involves additional regulatory requirements
for defueled reactors. When the earthquake and tsunami happened
in Japan, the reactor core in Fukushima Unit 4 was fully
offloaded into the spent fuel pool. This configuration is
termed a defueled condition. There is a gaping hole in the
regulatory safety net when reactors are defueled. When the NRC
issues operating licenses for reactors, appendix A to that
license contains the technical specifications. These
specifications establish ``the lowest functional capability of
performance levels of equipment required for safe operation of
the facility,'' along with the scope and frequency of testing
required to demonstrate that capability.
The operational condition of the reactor determines which
requirements are applicable when. When the entire reactor core
has been offloaded into the spent fuel pool, very few
requirements still apply. For example, the containment
structure surrounding the spent fuel pool is no longer required
to be available to be intact. This containment significantly
reduces the amount of radioactivity reaching the environment
from damaged fuel in the spent fuel pool, but only when it is
intact. Likewise, the specifications do not require normal
power, backup power, or even battery power to be available.
When the fuel is in the reactor core, the specifications
mandate safety measures to protect Americans from that hazard,
but when that hazard is entirely relocated to the spent fuel
pool, nearly all those safety measures can be removed. The NRC
must fix this deficiency as soon as possible to provide
adequate protection of public health when reactor cores are
defueled. In the interim, the NRC should seriously consider
banning full core reactor offloads into the spent fuel pool.
In conclusion, the measures we have recommended will lessen
the chance of a disaster at a U.S. nuclear power plant, but if
it happens anyway, the Federal Government would be able to look
Americans in the eye and say we took every reasonable measure
to protect you.
Thank you.

Dr. Harris. Thank you very much, Mr. Lochbaum. The
Committee will now recess so we can go and vote. We will
reconvene five minutes after the last vote.
Committee is in recess.
[Recess.]
Chairman Broun. I want to thank the witnesses for your
indulgence and apologize for the break, but we will try to
expedite this. I want to thank the panel for your testimony. I
remind Members that the Committee rules limit questioning to
five minutes.
The Chair, at this point, will open the round of questions.
The Chair recognizes himself for five minutes.
I am concerned nuclear groups will exploit the tragedy in
Fukushima as an excuse to halt not only future expansion of
nuclear power, but restrict relicensing of existing plants. Dr.
Sheron, are you--I have a hard time pronouncing it--Chairman
Jaczko and NRC committed to continue moving forward with
reviewing the application--license application for the Vogtle
plant in Georgia? What commitment can you provide that your
office will continue to provide the necessary information for
these licenses to advance?
Dr. Sheron. Right now the Agency does not believe that
there are any impediments to the continued either licensing of
new plants or the renewed license of existing plants, such as
the Vogel plant. So the Agency, as I understand, is moving
forward with the relicensing of the plant, the review, and
provided that the licensee provides all of the required
information, I believe they will maintain on the agreed upon
schedule.
Chairman Broun. Well, I certainly hope so. It is absolutely
critical for us to go forward in as expeditious a manner as
possible, and I would encourage you to do so.
The impetus for this hearing was the tragic event in Japan.
Since then, the American south has experienced a tragedy of its
own, in fact, even in my north Georgia district, several of my
counties have been hit by that tragedy. Recent tornados in
Alabama and the flooding of the Mississippi River unfortunately
provide another opportunity for us to learn. How has the NRC
incorporated in lessons learned from the recent events in the
South? It has been reported that some reactors were taken
offline as a result of the extreme weather. To your knowledge,
were there any problems with any of these? How will this impact
NRC's research portfolio, and how did the previous safety
reviews prepare the U.S. for these events?
Dr. Sheron. The events, the tornados that took place in the
South did take down some transmission lines at some plants,
which did cause loss of offsite power. My understanding is the
emergency diesel generators at those sites did work as
designed.
We look at all natural phenomena that occur in the United
States. We confer with other agencies, as I said before, like
USGS, to determine if there is any new information that we need
to take into account in the design of these plants. Nuclear
plants are designed for tornados, for high winds, for storms.
We look at floods that might occur in the vicinity when these
plants are licensed to make sure that they are designed such
that they can handle them.
If we learn anything new that says the current design base
for these plants is not adequate, then obviously the Agency
will take action to make the plant--install, you know, whatever
corrections are necessary.
Chairman Broun. The answer is no problem at this point?
Dr. Sheron. Yes.
Chairman Broun. Okay, very good. Now that this
Administration has decided to ignore the law and clear
congressional direction, our Nation has no long-term storage
plans for radioactive waste. Where is spent fuel stored at
Fukushima? Where is the U.S. currently storing its spent fuel?
How many sites have currently filled their available storage
space? Have any waivers been granted or regulatory changes made
to allow greater onsite storage, and has any comparative risk
analysis been done to compare centralized storage with
dispersed storage? Doctor?
Dr. Sheron. The spent fuel at the Fukushima plant, as I
understand, was stored on the site in the pools. I do not know
if they had any dry cask storage. At the U.S. right now, plants
store their fuel either at--in their spent fuel pools which
have been designed to handle the amount of fuel that they can
put in, that they can hold, or to independent spent fuel
storage facilities, ISFS, they are called. Usually these are
dry casks that are stored onsite or nearby, and are basically--
require air cooling.
Chairman Broun. Are you going to allow expansion of those
local pools since the Administration has closed down the Yucca
Mountain storage facility?
Dr. Sheron. Some licensees have come in and proposed to
rerack the pools, which is to ``do'' a more dense configuration
where they can hold more fuel. Licensees have to come in and
present a safety analysis to demonstrate why that is acceptable
and safe. I can't tell you which ones have done that so far. I
don't have that information with me. I know there are some
plants that do have the high density fuel racks.
With regard to a comparative risk study, with regard to--
let me call it a minimally loaded spent fuel pool versus a
fully loaded one, my office is beginning to undertake a
comparative risk study to see what the differences are in risk
to public health and safety between the two. My personal
opinion is that pools have a lot of water in them, and
regardless of the amount of fuel, it takes a very long time, if
there was an accident, to actually drain the pool to the point
where there would be an uncovering of the fuel, which gives
licensees ample time to bring in either emergency equipment or
to restore whatever did fail.
Usually--and even if it was a drain down that was occurring
or a boil off, the amount of time that is available before one
actually starts as a release of radioactivity provides ample
time for evacuation in the vicinity of the site so that people
could be evacuated and there wouldn't be any harmful radiation
effects.
Chairman Broun. Thank you, Doctor. Your answer just further
points out the need to open up Yucca Mountain for the
Administration to start obeying the law.
I now recognize Ms. Edwards for five minutes, and I will
give you some leeway on that, Ms. Edwards. You are recognized
for five minutes.
Ms. Edwards. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the
witnesses for your patience. Before I begin questions, I would
like to ask the Chairman for unanimous consent to enter two
Nuclear Regulatory Commission reports relating to the shutdown
at Calvert Cliffs that I referenced earlier, and a report by
Mr. Lochbaum at the Union of Concerned Scientists on the 14
near-misses at U.S. power plants and their safety.
Chairman Broun. Any objections? Hearing no objections, so
ordered.

Ms. Edwards. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I have a
question, actually, for Mr. Lochbaum. I know that the Union of
Concerned Scientists in that report that we just entered into
the record concluded that ``Nuclear subsidies effectively
separate risk from reward, shifting the burden of possible
losses onto the public and encouraging speculative investment
by masking the true cost of nuclear power, and that subsidies
also allow the industry to exaggerate its economic
competitiveness. Consequently, they diminish or delay support
for more economical and less risky alternatives, like energy
efficiency and renewable energy.'' That is a direct quote from
your report. Do you believe that the nuclear power companies
would be economically viable without substantial federal
subsidies they receive from taxpayers?
Mr. Lochbaum. Based on the work we have done and the
industry's own request for loan guarantees and other subsidies,
the answer seems pretty clear that they would not be.
Ms. Edwards. I wonder if you could elaborate on how public
subsidies, and especially at the levels at which we subsidize
the industry to nuclear power distort risk in the nuclear power
industry?
Mr. Lochbaum. I think the best example of that would be the
Price-Anderson Federal Liability Protection. Plant owners have
to get approximately $375 million of private liability
insurance, and the Price-Anderson Act protects against
liability costs above that. That is a big savings for the plant
owners, but more importantly, it discourages the reactor
vendors from developing designs that are less risky and much
safer, because there is no incentive--while the higher cost of
those safety features may be borne out, because they don't get
a break on the insurance protection, the liability insurance
that they get, it is hard to sell that into a marketplace when
you are competing with cheaper, less safe reactors. So the
federal subsidies are actually discouraging reactor designers
from coming up with safer reactors that better protect
Americans.
Ms. Edwards. So this leads me to a question about
identifying and fixing safety risks. Do you think the NRC does
what it needs to in both identifying safety risks and forcing
fixes to these known safety problems at our power plants in a
timely way?
Mr. Lochbaum. During my ten years experience with UCS and
during my predecessor's 20 years, we find that the NRC does a
very good job at setting the safety bar at the right height.
They establish regulations that provide adequate protection of
public health. They don't do a very good job of enforcing those
regulations. Too many plant owners are limboing beneath the
safety bar for too long, putting Americans at higher risk, and
additionally driving the costs of nuclear power upwards
inexplicably.
Ms. Edwards. So in my colleague Mr. Harris's opening
statement, he indicated that Fukushima is a type of accident
that really is not possible here, given our nuclear regulatory
environment, and so Mr. Lochbaum, I wonder if you could respond
to that question as to whether there is a major nuclear--
whether a major nuclear accident is actually possible here in
the United States, given the NRC's oversight of our reactors?
Mr. Lochbaum. I think, again, the best proof that it is
possible is the fact that the nuclear industry cannot operate
nuclear power plants without federal liability protection. If
there wasn't a chance of such a catastrophic accident, they
could go down to State Farm and get private liability
insurance. The fact that they can't means that they themselves
recognize that these plants are unusual hazards of
unprecedented nature.
Ms. Edwards. So let us go to something as simple as battery
backup. At Fukushima, you indicated that the battery--I think
it was in Mr. Barrett's testimony--I apologize, I probably got
it all wrong. Whoever had the slides up there--that the battery
backup at Fukushima was eight hours of battery backup, and
compared to U.S. plants, what is the backup like at U.S. plants
in the event of some catastrophic disaster?
Mr. Lochbaum. The battery backup is basically the same for
U.S. reactors. Some reactors only have four hours of battery
backup, so they would be even more vulnerable to that
situation. Studies done by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
show that many of our reactors, the station blackout where you
are relying on battery, the De Salle plant in Illinois, for
example, that is 80 percent of the overall risk of core
meltdown. It is equal to four times the risk of all other
things leading to meltdown combined, so it is station blackout
and battery dependence at our U.S. reactor.
Ms. Edwards. Yes, so let us take away the fact that we
might have a hurricane or tornado, or some other thing, simple
blackout that could be caused by any number of factors actually
poses a strong vulnerability for risk, isn't that right?
Mr. Lochbaum. That is absolutely right. I mean, when you
get down to station blackouts, you only have one safety system
working. If something causes that to go away, you played beat
the clock and lost, like they did in Japan.
Ms. Edwards. Thank you very much, and thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
Chairman Broun. Thank you, Ms. Edwards.
Now I recognize Mr. Rohrabacher for five minutes.
Mr. Rohrabacher. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and
thank you for your leadership in holding this hearing.
Let me first ask, you just made a statement about the
subsidies, and without the subsidies nuclear power would not be
able to compete. Is that not also true of solar and most of the
other renewables? By the way, we subsidize them to the tune of
billions every day, so here we are--are those subsidies not
necessary? Is this a new revenue source for us to defund those
subsidies for the renewables?
Mr. Lochbaum. There is no such thing as a free lunch.
Everybody gets a shot at the apple. I think the point we were
trying to make was that nuclear power has been subsidized so
heavily over so many years and has built in subsidies that it
is not a level playing field.
Mr. Rohrabacher. I got you, but you reach a certain plateau
and subsidies are still necessary for the nuclear energy, but
let me just note, as we stand today, we are subsidizing perhaps
even heavier these new supposed renewable sources of energy.
How many people--I am just asking the panel--how many
people have died in nuclear power accidents over the last 50
years here in the United States? Anybody?
Mr. Lochbaum. There is the one that is buried in Arlington
from the January 3, 1961 accident, so----
Mr. Rohrabacher. So since 1961 has there been anybody? I
mean, there is one guy back in 1961. Anybody else?
Mr. Lochbaum. He had two colleagues.
Mr. Rohrabacher. Okay. How many people have died in the
production of coal during that time period? I think we are
talking about hundreds of people, are we not, maybe thousands.
Mr. Lochbaum. Probably in the thousands.
Mr. Rohrabacher. Probably in the thousands, because we are
also talking about lung disease that people get from coal, et
cetera. So there is a place for that, too, although coal isn't
subsidized, or is it subsidized? Yes. Perhaps we are taking
care through the black lung whatever fund that we have and that
we fund federally, so there are subsidies for coal even as
well.
So what strikes me today is, of course, we have seen the
crisis over in Japan, this horrible accident which we now seem
to say that there are not large numbers of people dying, but
this puts people at risk. Have people lost their lives in Japan
already? Has anybody been--and I mean, I know in Chernobyl they
certainly did. Is the Japanese accident resulted in loss of
life?
Mr. Sheron. We are not aware of any nuclear related deaths
from the Fukushima.
Mr. Rohrabacher. Well the tsunami, of course. Right.
Mr. Sheron. Yeah, the tsunami, obviously people died there,
but if not----
Mr. Rohrabacher. Any nuclear-related deaths? All right. Now
let me just say that this is--all of this is happening while we
are utilizing 50-year-old technology. All the complaints that
we hear and the risk that is being taken, if there is a risk,
is happening because we are utilizing 50-year-old nuclear
technology. Light water reactors were put in place in the '60s,
were they not?
Mr. Sheron. Even sooner than that.
Mr. Rohrabacher. Right, even sooner than that. There is a
new generation of nuclear power plants that come to grips with
many of the challenges that exist that require subsidies, et
cetera, for the nuclear industry, and that new technology is
actually focused on small modular reactors and high temperature
gas cool reactors. Should we not then start focusing our
efforts on these new technologies rather than making the light
water reactors a bit safer? Shouldn't we be focusing our
research and energy on putting in place high temperature gas
cool reactors which cannot melt down and maybe these small
modular reactors, which would be dramatically safer?
Mr. Sheron. I will take a shot at that. At the NRC, we
don't really pass judgment on what kind of reactors should be
built. We leave that up to the industry and the Department of
Energy to determine that. Our job is to determine if what is
put in front of us meets our regulations and is safe.
Mr. Rohrabacher. Let me just--for the record, Mr. Chairman,
state that in various studies that I have made and hearings
that I have been at, it is very clear that we have now the
capability of overcoming many of the challenges that nuclear
energy 50 years ago posed to us. For example, the elimination
of waste, you actually have some of these new reactors that
will bring the level of waste being stored in Yucca Mountain
down, rather than bundle it up, meaning that it actually burns
used fuel as part of its own fuel cycle.
So as we look at the safety and the challenges of nuclear
energy, I would hope that we keep in mind that a lot of the
challenges and a lot of the criticisms are the old technology,
and we have a great new opportunity to move forward with new
technology and solve these problems.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Broun. Thank you, Mr. Rohrabacher.
Chair now recognized Mr. Miller for five minutes.
Mr. Miller. Thank you. Dr. Lochbaum mentioned the Price-
Anderson Act as a substantial subsidy for the industry, and in
traditional economic theory, the market mechanism for safety is
liability, that if you cause harm to others, then you are
responsible for it. You make them whole, you compensate them
for their losses. Does anyone dispute that a cap on liability
is a subsidy to an industry?
Okay, so you all agree with that. I understand that Price-
Anderson limits the liability to $375 million. What
relationship does that have to the actual risk? Dr. Lochbaum?
Mr. Lochbaum. It is pretty much decoupled from that. That
was set as a number that has been upped over the years. The way
Price-Anderson works, if there is offsite damages that exceed
that number, whatever it is, then the rest of the surviving
reactors are invoiced to make up the difference. In the old
days when they regulated utility companies, that secondary pool
was pretty much guaranteed. Today, many of the reactors are
limited liability corporations that may shut down and not be
available to pay into that secondary pool.
Mr. Miller. I guess my question is will the actual lawsuits
of Fukushima or a similar accident be anywhere in the
neighborhood of $375 million, or whatever the liability is
under Price-Anderson, or it could be substantially more?
Mr. Lochbaum. If Fukushima is any indication, they drive by
that almost the first day, very quickly. Much higher.
Mr. Miller. And the subsidy is perhaps not borne by
taxpayers, but it is borne by random depending on which way the
wind blows.
Mr. Rohrabacher mentioned the experience since 1961, and
usually lawsuits go into actuarial considerations and
underwriting and insurance is pretty good at that. That is
their business. Even with no deaths since 1961, do any of you
think that industry could get insurance--liability insurance
without a cap, given the 50 years of no deaths? No one thinks
that? I mean, so the industry continues to say that the risk is
acceptable, so long as someone else bears it? If the risk is on
them, it is unacceptable.
Dr. Lochbaum, there sometimes is a tradeoff between safety
and profits. In your work in the industry, have you identified
any shortcuts that might be--might make operations more
profitable but less safe?
Mr. Lochbaum. There are those opportunities. For example,
we are aware of right now that the industry knows of about half
the plants operating in the United States don't need fire
protection regulations who were adopted after the 1975 fire at
Brown's Ferry. The plant owners who have consciously spent the
money to come into compliance are actually at a cost
disadvantage to their neighbors who are outlaws, nuclear
outlaws. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is basically
enabling bad behavior that drives cheaper plants to be less
safe plants. If the industry were to enforce its regulations,
those fire protection regulations, people would be protected,
but more importantly, the people wouldn't benefit from
violating the law as they have in the past.
Mr. Miller. All right. Mr. Rohrabacher also mentioned new
technologies. Do you think the new technology will dramatically
change the potential risk of nuclear accidents? Could a nuclear
power company--a company operating a nuclear power plant go to
insurance companies and say look, we have got this new
technology, now will you write us some coverage?
Mr. Lochbaum. At a House hearing back in I think it was
2006, there was a vendor, reactor vendor at the table who was
asked that question, and he said his company was so--could
stand behind their reactor design and opt out of Price-
Anderson. No other reactor vendors I have heard have said that,
and reactor operators haven't said that either.
Mr. Miller. Okay. Do you--Dr. Lochbaum, how safe do you
think these plants will be if--compared to the old technology?
Will there be a dramatic difference in safety?
Mr. Lochbaum. What we have in the new reactors is that the
chances of an accident are less with the new reactors, but any
time a safety gain is made in that regard, the containment is
made less robust and there are savings done, so that the cost
remains the same. As a result, the number of accidents would be
fewer, but the number of dead bodies will be greater.
Mr. Miller. My time is almost expired. I will yield back
the little bit that I have got.
Chairman Broun. Thank you, Mr. Miller.
Chair now recognizes Dr. Harris for five minutes.
Dr. Harris. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to
thank the panel for your patience as we went and voted.
Mr. Lochbaum, from what I understand, you are making the
availability to get liability insurance kind of a guide as to
how safe something is. I know a lot of obstetricians and
neurosurgeons in some States who just can't get liability
insurance from commercial companies. They literally couldn't
get it, so the State had to form insurance companies. How is
that different from what is going on? I mean, I assume that
there are people who still think it is safe to go to an
obstetrician, safe to go to a neurosurgeon, but in fact, there
are instances where you can't conduct normal business, because
look, there is tort in this world. What can I say? Isn't that
true? I mean, aren't there other circumstances where the
government has to step in to insure things that people consider
pretty safe, I mean, going to an obstetrician, going to a
neurosurgeon?
Mr. Lochbaum. There is, but if you look in the energy
technology sector, nuclear power is the only one that is so
hazardous that it needs----
Dr. Harris. Oh, I understand that, but in the medical
sector it is only OB/GYNs and neurosurgery. That doesn't mean
that it is dangerous to go to a neurosurgeon, that is my only
point. I mean, to use that as--you know, because you do
represent the Union of Concerned Scientists, I mean, I don't
think that is a very scientific way to look at it, to be honest
with you, because we know from other areas where tort law is an
issue that that just doesn't work. The world just doesn't work
that way. It is not that simple.
Dr. Boice, there has been--you know, part of the discussion
and I think Mr. Lochbaum's testimony actually brings it up,
part of the problem is with spent fuel and the risks with spent
fuel. You know, an issue that I think is probably going to come
before us at some point is the getting spent fuel out of these
plants and eventually getting to a central location. Have you
looked into at all the risks associated on populations with
using a central repository like Yucca Mountain? Do you have any
writings that you can provide me or provide the Committee?
Dr. Boice. No, not specifically with regard to spent fuel
and enhanced levels of radiation in the background. We have
done a number of studies of people that lived in areas of
enhanced background radiation in China and other countries
where they have been exposed to increased levels that might, in
some sense, be relevant. We have also done studies that
evaluated cancer risks around all the nuclear power facilities,
including those with proximal spent fuel storage in the United
States and all the DoE facilities. So there actually are a
number of studies in counties and areas close by that we could
provide for you that might be somewhat relevant, but not
specific to spent fuels and the levels of radiation from those
exposures.
Dr. Harris. And is it because--I mean, is the reason
because that is a--is probably a much, much lower risk than the
risks associated with the plant, which is already low enough,
than the storage of spent fuels in a facility like Yucca
Mountain?
Dr. Boice. I just have not had an opportunity to look at
that issue, except indirectly since many nuclear power plants
have their spent fuel stored in areas close to the operating
reactor.
Dr. Harris. Okay, thank you very much.
Mr. Barrett, as you are aware, the Department of Energy
does and has been moving forward with their next generation
nuclear plant project for some time. My understanding is that
the high temperature gas cooled reactors may have some very
specific safety advantages, some of which--mitigating some of
the risks we have been talking about today. Could you speak to
the safety characteristics of that kind of reactor?
Mr. Barrett. I am not an expert on gas cooled reactors, but
I know a little bit about them. They have very excellent
physics. They have a lot of very valuable safety aspects. They
have developmental challenges ahead of them, economics and
other things as well. But gas cooled reactors are a very good,
safe technology. It is very passive, it doesn't heat up as
quickly as some of the others do.
Dr. Harris. In your opinion, would that be a reason perhaps
for the Department of Energy to more aggressively pursue
research into that, because it does address some of those
problems with things like passive cooling?
Mr. Barrett. The Department of Energy has many worthy
projects that they are working in their R&D program, that
certainly is a worthy project and it is there. Relative to
other R&D projects, I am afraid I can't really judge from where
I am today.
Dr. Harris. Okay, thank you very much. I am going to yield
back my time, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Broun. Thank you, Dr. Harris.
Now the Chair recognizes Mr. McNerney for five minutes.
Mr. McNerney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. One of the
advantages of being the last Member to ask questions, I may
have a little extra leeway in terms of my time, so I don't feel
quite as pressured.
We are a little lucky here in Congress to have so many
physicians that can expand their experience to the rest of
life, so I really appreciate the wisdom that we get very
frequently from the other side of the aisle in that regard.
Let us talk about the backlog at the NRC. Would--Dr.
Sheron, can you describe how long it would take for someone or
an organization that submits a design to get the decision on
that design?
Mr. Sheron. I presume you are talking about a new plant
design?
Mr. McNerney. Yes.
Mr. Sheron. I believe that the Agency has identified a
schedule. I can't remember exactly what the time is. I believe
it is on the order of maybe several years.
Mr. McNerney. Five years?
Mr. Sheron. I think it is less than that. A lot of it is
dependent upon the quality of the submittal, however, whether
the licensee--the applicant has adequately addressed all of the
safety issues and is providing a strong technical basis to
support them.
Mr. McNerney. So is the new design evaluation in
competition for resources, for NRC resources with safety
evaluations of existing plants or new issues that come up in
that regard?
Mr. Sheron. No. When there was an indication that there
would be new designs coming in, the Agency purposely split the
Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation into two separate offices.
One is the Office of New Reactors, and the other is the Office
of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. The Office of Nuclear Reactor
Regulation focuses solely on the safety of the current 104
operating plants. The Office of New Reactors focuses solely on
the licensing of the new applications.
Mr. McNerney. So would you say that your modeling--and I am
not trying to throw arrows here or anything--that your modeling
capabilities are state of the art, you have the best computers,
the best numerical techniques and so on in doing modeling, both
of the design and of the nuclear fuel rod modeling, safety
modeling?
Mr. Sheron. Yes, I would probably say that the NRC has the
best--some of the best models in the world, which is evidenced
by the fact that most of the other nuclear countries--developed
nuclear countries request our models, and we have a numerous
cooperative programs where we provide our models to others to
use.
Mr. McNerney. Okay, good. Now with regard to failsafe, in
my mind, failsafe means fail safe. It doesn't mean fail badly.
We have had a couple of cases lately, one in Fukushima, one in
the Gulf Coast last year where failsafe really didn't mean fail
safe. Is your modeling able to predict any of these failures
that were supposed to be failsafe that actually weren't
failsafe?
Mr. Sheron. We don't--I don't think there are any designs
right now that are totally failsafe. Obviously one can
postulate failures that are going to, you know, lead to an
accident. Our computer codes are able to model those failures
and to predict the consequences. If we see that the
consequences are too high or that there are other mitigative
things that could be done, then we certainly pursue them with
the industry or through regulation.
Mr. McNerney. So I mean, you basically have said--I think
you just said that the current design is not really failsafe.
That is basically the situation, isn't it?
Mr. Sheron. Well, what I am saying is that there are low
probability events that one could postulate, okay? In other
words, if one postulates enough failures, which again, become
very low probability----
Mr. McNerney. Well they sound like they are low probability
until they happen, and then they say geez, that wasn't as
unlikely as we thought it was. Obviously, no one predicted a
14-meter tsunami in Japan. That was completely unforeseen.
Mr. Sheron. It was not unforeseen. I have heard reports
that there was some prediction that the design basis at
Fukushima was not adequate, but I am not at liberty or I am not
really going to speculate on whether that is appropriate, you
know, in other words whether or not the TEPCO organization
designed the plant properly. What I will say is that we have
looked at the design of U.S. plants against tsunamis and
earthquakes, and we have concluded that we believe that our
plants, you know, are adequately designed for those. In other
words, we can predict fairly well, for example, the wave height
of any tsunami that might occur and we make sure that the
plants are adequately designed.
Mr. McNerney. But we have heard this morning that a simple
blackout, which could last, depending on what the cause is, for
a week or a month if there is a significant transformer that
goes down at a substation, which puts these plants at
significant risk.
Mr. Sheron. You have got to be careful when you say it is a
simple blackout. It is not a simple blackout. What the--what
you are concerned about is first that you lose the offsite
power source, which is the preferred source of power to the
plant. The plant has two independent diesel generators that are
designed to start and provide electricity to power the safety
systems. You now have to postulate that both of those diesels
don't start, not just one, but both don't start. Then there are
additional backup systems that will run for some period of
time. We do----
Mr. McNerney. That sounds good, but we just saw at
Fukushima that that wasn't necessarily the case.
I just want to make a little plug here. You know, you talk
about the current generation of nuclear being safer--the
current technology being safer than 50-year-old technology, and
maybe that is the case, you know. I don't really know, I am not
a nuclear engineer. But there is fast neutron technology that
would be inherently failsafe, is that correct, Dr. Lochbaum?
Mr. Lochbaum. I am not aware of that, I would have to look.
I don't know offhand if that is true or false.
Mr. McNerney. Well, I find myself in agreement with Mr.
Rohrabacher, and I am going to take just a few more moments
here. We need to be aware of the new technology and make sure
that if there is a fourth generation or fast neutron technology
that it gets proper attention, and meanwhile, be very skeptical
of claims of failsafe or highly improbable incidents.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your indulgence.
Chairman Broun. You are quite welcome.
We will now undertake a second round of questions, and I
yield myself five minutes.
Mr. Barrett, Chairman Jaczko made a recommendation or made
a judgment of a 50-mile evacuation to U.S. citizens at
Fukushima. Were you involved in evacuation actions during the
Three Mile Island accident?
Mr. Barrett. Yes, I was at Three Mile Island, not at
Fukushima.
Chairman Broun. I should just ask you about Three Mile
Island. Were there any NRC lessons learned from that
experience?
Mr. Barrett. Yes, the NRC and everybody learned a lot from
that experience. One of the lessons learned from that is it is
not just the nuclear computer codes and the ``what if''
calculations that are made at that time, but it is also what
are the conditions on the ground, what is the situation with
the people? Because you are trying to make a judgment call,
whoever is making these evacuation recommendation decisions, to
do the best thing for the people at that time under those
conditions.
Chairman Broun. Do you think this was done properly at
Three Mile Island?
Mr. Barrett. At Three Mile Island, at the time we made the
decisions, and I was part of that, I thought it was the right
thing to do at that time. However, I went and lived there for
four years and I saw what the impact of that was and what the
practicality of what an evacuation does to the people. After I
learned from that experience, I felt it was inappropriate that
we did that evacuation at Three Mile Island in the early days.
Chairman Broun. After your experiences at Three Mile
Island, do you believe that the 50-mile judgment by NRC
Chairman Jaczko made for U.S. citizens at Fukushima was
appropriate, and if you would please explain?
Mr. Barrett. No, I don't think that really was Chairman
Jaczko's judgement in the net sense. I believe that decision
was a poor judgment decision, insofar as it was
counterproductive and detrimental to all the people in Japan,
the Japanese people as well as the Americans, because I don't
think it appropriately considered the horrendous conditions
that the people of Japan were under at that point with the
tsunami and the earthquake. I mean, people were freezing in the
north. A 50-mile evacuation radius hinders the ability of the
people in the unaffected south to bring lifesaving supplies and
things to people in the north. So I think it did not
appropriately consider the situation on the ground. It was my
understanding it was more of a worst case computer analysis
``what if'' type of projection. So my sense is there was not a
sufficient evaluation of the conditions in Japan. I think it
put a lot of confusion and uncertainty in the minds of people
between the 12-mile official Japanese radius and the 50-mile
U.S. one. People would ask each other ``Why is yours different
from mine?'' In my view, I think one country should not second
guess another country from 10,000 miles away as to what is the
best thing for the citizens at that point.
Chairman Broun. Thank you, Mr. Barrett.
Next question is for Dr. Boice. In the days following the
Japanese disaster, U.S. Surgeon General Regina Benjamin
responded to questioning about citizens stocking up on
potassium iodide--actions were ``definitely appropriate''
cautions to take. What is your reaction to this suggestion, and
is there any scientific basis for such recommendation, given
the radiation levels that were detected?
Dr. Boice. I believe--when the surgeon general mentioned
that, it was shortly after the accident and all the evidence
wasn't in about the radiation releases. When we found that the
levels were so tiny, it certainly is an inappropriate action to
make the statement that we should be distributing potassium
iodide pills. I concur with the public health department from
California and also the director of our own CDC that potassium
iodide should not be given. There are adverse health effects,
and particularly dangerous for people who have sensitivities to
iodine, people who have thyroid disease and also people who are
allergic to shellfish. Then if it is taken inappropriately,
there can be serious effects such as heart abnormalities,
nausea, and diarrhea. So the benefit, which is almost
nonexistent because the levels of radiation are so incredibly
small, is not sufficient with regard to these potential adverse
health effects.
Chairman Broun. Dr. Boice, I appreciate your efforts to put
radiation risk in perspective. I was struck that you note that
the U.S. Capitol building is frequently cited as having some of
the highest radiation levels in the United States at 85
millirem per year. Could you put that level, which Members and
employees of Congress are exposed to every day, in perspective
with amount of elevated radiation that Americans on the West
Coast might have been exposed to as the result of Fukushima?
Dr. Boice. Certainly. The Capitol building for long term
exposures of over a year might be on the order of 85 millirem
from the gamma rays from the granite that was used in the
building. From the Fukushima radiation, the potential exposure
even to California is much, much less than one unit, 1
millirem. So it is a very tiny, inconsequential exposure. It is
much less than just what we get every day from normal radiation
exposures from natural background.
Chairman Broun. Thank you, Dr. Boice. I now recognize Ms.
Edwards for five minutes.
Ms. Edwards. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you very
much for this second round of testimony.
You know, we heard from Mr. Rohrabacher that since we
haven't had scores of dead bodies from past nuclear accidents,
we shouldn't be worried about the future safety of nuclear
plants, and I think the jury is still out, frankly, on what the
long-term consequences are of even Fukushima, and I would note
that as yet, nobody has done one of those longitudinal studies
because we haven't actually had sufficient time pass. And yet,
I keep seeing claims also that accidents like Fukushima
couldn't happen here and that health effects of the disaster in
Japan were inconsequential. Again, I think the jury is still
out, but it does seem to be a bit of a mixed message that
suggests that we are safe and nothing bad has happened anyway,
and so, you know, let us just wait. And then here I see the
cover of this week's New York Times on the Wednesday edition,
and here you have got people--a couple in Japan in radiation
protection gear, clearing out their precious possessions from a
home that they may never be able to return to because of an
accident. So I don't think we should have to wait until the
accident happens before we figure out the safety of our plants.
Mr. Lochbaum, I wonder if you could tell us whether we
understand the full impacts of Fukushima on health and safety
in the communities around the plant, and if you could,
elaborate on the 14 near-misses that occurred at U.S. power
plants last year alone, and your key findings about what your
biggest concerns are regarding nuclear safety here in this
country?
Mr. Lochbaum. To address the first part of that question, I
don't think we know what the human fallout from Fukushima will
be. For example, because of the contamination they have had to
increase the dose at schools in the area. Essentially, they
have drafted all the school children into the nuclear workforce
and the school children are now applied to the same radiation
limits as nuclear plant workers. They had to do that, they
really had no choice. The radiation levels are so high. The
radiation elevation could cause problems for those children
down the road, and we won't know that, unfortunately, for a
while.
The study we did, we looked at the 14 near-misses, and the
near-misses were times--events that occurred at nuclear power
plants where the NRC had to send out a special team to look.
What we found was that most of those 14, there were warning
signs that were missed by the plant's owner and by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission that had they been heeded, the near-miss
would have been avoided.
What concerns us about that is if you continue to miss--
overlook the near-misses, the warning signs, you are setting
the stage for preexisting conditions to cause that very bad
day, should they be challenged. So the fact that we got lucky
on those near-misses is great, but we need to remove luck from
the equation to the extent we can.
Ms. Edwards. Thank you very much.
Lastly, I think we have heard a lot about--and Mr.
Rohrabacher alluded to this--that we haven't built a new plant
in this country for 30 years. New plants are being built
overseas. I understand that they are being build in Finland and
France and those have been pointed to as examples of where we
need to go in terms of the technology, but I wonder if you can
tell us, particularly Mr. Lochbaum, how the construction of
those reactors is going? Are they on schedule, are they on
budget, are we going to see them come online at any time,
because it underscores, I think, the question about whether it
makes sense to invest in these kind of long-term huge costs for
a new plant without having the most aggressive regulatory
scheme in place to make sure that they are safe.
Mr. Lochbaum. Well, both the nuclear plant under
construction in Finland and in France are over budget and
behind schedule. It is more than 25 percent over budget in
Finland and several years behind schedule. They had trouble
pouring concrete. They got bad concrete as a result. They had
trouble with pipes, basic stuff that is nuclear 101 we didn't
learn from the first go around and they are paying the price,
not us.
Ms. Edwards. So what was--the cost of the French plant was
what, initially?
Mr. Lochbaum. I don't--$6 billion.
Ms. Edwards. And it is 25 percent over budget?
Mr. Lochbaum. So far, they are not done yet.
Ms. Edwards. Okay, and they are not done yet, so in the end
we could be talking about a $10 billion plant, and we still
can't assure all of the safety considerations will be made.
Mr. Lochbaum. Going back to an earlier question, one of the
things that France is doing--France is the vendor of that
reactor that is being built. In order to try to market it
elsewhere, they are taking some of the safety features out to
reduce the price tag of the plant.
Ms. Edwards. Thank you, and with that, I yield back.
Chairman Broun. Thank you, Ms. Edwards.
I now recognize Dr. Harris for five minutes.
Dr. Harris. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you
for a second round so we can clear up some of these questions.
Dr. Sheron, very briefly in a minute or less, can you
outline the evidence that our plants are not safe?
Mr. Sheron. Our plants are not safe?
Dr. Harris. Yeah, because there has been discussion that
our plants aren't safe. Is there any evidence, scientific
evidence, any evidence, injuries in the United States in the,
you know, use of nuclear power for civilian use, anything like
that. Is there any evidence that our plants are not safe?
Mr. Sheron. I am not aware of any.
Dr. Harris. Okay, thank you. Now, your office is
considering updating spent fuel safety studies to estimate the
relative consequence of removing older fuel from the spent fuel
pool and placing it in dry storage. Have you specifically
studied the additional risk associated with storing spent fuel
onsite at operating reactors, as well as not operating and
decommissioned reactors versus storing the spent fuel in a
centralized geologic repository?
Mr. Sheron. No, that we haven't.
Dr. Harris. And is that something you think deserves closer
examination, to answer that question about spent fuel? Where is
it safer to store?
Mr. Sheron. I am probably not qualified to answer that. I
think, you know, what we look at is if there is not a
repository, is it safe to store the fuel in an interim, you
know, location such as onsite in dry casks?
Dr. Harris. But not a question of whether--because you, I
guess, make the practical assumption there may not be another
repository, so that is probably why you haven't looked at it, I
imagine, because it is simply a theoretical possibility?
Mr. Sheron. Well, I just don't know.
Dr. Harris. Okay, thank you.
Mr. Lochbaum, thank you for coming and testifying. You
stated up front, you know, in your testimony that your
organization's goal was to minimize the inherent risk of
nuclear energy, and I take it that if you could make it safe
that it would be something that would kind of satisfy your
organization's search for something to minimize climate change,
for instance.
But with that in mind that your organization wants to
minimize the inherent risks, what is the organization's
position or your position on how to manage our stockpile of
nuclear waste? Do you think it is safer to leave it onsite at
the 100-plus individual sites we have, or put it at a single
location that is geographically isolated, away from population
centers, underground, miles underground?
Mr. Lochbaum. We talked to that subject to the president of
the Blue Ribbon Commission on the American Nuclear Future last
august, and what we recommended was centralized interim storage
for the permanently shut down plants where the only hazard left
is spent fuel. Transfer that to some centralized location. We
didn't specify it was above ground or below ground, but----
Dr. Harris. So you do think that is a good idea?
Mr. Lochbaum. Yes.
Dr. Harris. Mr. Barrett, given your experience at the
Department's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management,
what do you think about that?
Mr. Barrett. I fully agree. I believe we also need a
geological repository for the permanent disposal of the waste
that our generations have been making now for 40, 50 years and
not just give this problem to our great grandchildren. So I
think this country needs to move forward with Yucca Mountain,
or if it has a better facility, let us have the better
facility, but let us move forward while we are alive.
Dr. Harris. And I take it you feel--that is not only for
decommissioned plants, but that is even for the spent fuel when
it cools down enough even to be shipped from operating plants.
Mr. Barrett. The decommissioned plants should be the first
to go, and we have the two plants up in the northwest where
there is a tsunami risk, even though it is in dry storage, that
risk should not be there at all. There are almost a dozen of
these old facilities. These should be the first to move but
then we also need to start removing spent fuel from the
operating plants, too, and reduce that risk as well.
Dr. Harris. Sure.
And finally, Dr. Sheron, would you please describe where
the NRC currently is in its licensing efforts for the next
generation nuclear plant project? How long do you think it
might be or would take the Commission to issue a combined
license?
Mr. Sheron. For the NGNP, we have already started doing
research at the NRC to support our licensing reviews of that
design when it is submitted by the Department of Energy. The
last schedule I saw was that of the application, again, is
complete and technically defensible. We had a three year review
schedule, in which case--I'm sorry, at the end of three years
we would issue the combined operating license.
Dr. Harris. Okay, thank you very much. I will yield back
the balance of my time.
Chairman Broun. Thank you, Dr. Harris.
The chairman will recognize Mr. Miller for five minutes.
Mr. Miller. Thank you.
Quickly on the fact that there have been no new nuclear
power plants in 30 years, in North Carolina 30 years ago,
almost all of the cities and municipalities that had municipal
power systems invested in a piece of one of Duke Power's
nuclear facilities, and almost all of those cities came very
close to bankruptcy as a result. It was hideously more
expensive, even with all the subsidies that we have discussed.
So it probably is not a regulatory burden, it probably was
truly just much more expensive, even with the dramatic--very
substantial subsidies that we have gotten.
We have had some discussions of storage of spent fuel,
about Yucca Mountain, about what to do with the closed down
facilities, but you know--and we haven't even discussed the
transportation of that fuel. There is not a star Trek
transporter technology. It will not be beamed from the plant to
a permanent facility. There are risks and transportation and on
and on.
Part of the story coming out of Fukushima has been the
spent fuel pools. Dr. Lochbaum, what have we learned--should we
have learned form the Fukushima experience with spent fuel.
Mr. Lochbaum. When the event occurred at Fukushima, there
were seven spent fuel pools that contained the radiated fuel.
There were also radiated fuel in dry casks. That doesn't make
the news very much because it survived without a problem. There
was--the spent fuel in dry casks is safe, secure, not leaking
radioactivity, so the dry cask endured that challenge that the
spent fuel pools did not. I think it was a reminder--it wasn't
so much a lesson--that dry cask storage is less vulnerable both
from a security standpoint and a safety standpoint, and we
should act upon that lesson rather than just continue to
document it.
Mr. Miller. Okay, and you think that that should be
required by regulation, by the NRC?
Mr. Lochbaum. It should happen. It would be nice if the
plant owners did it for safety reasons; if not, then the NRC
should do it for -- to protect the American public safety, and
if not then the Congress should make it happen. However it
happens, we need to make that happen.
Mr. Miller. All right. Dr. Lochbaum, again, you are very
familiar with this industry. How would you characterize the
level of candor of the industry with respect to safety issues
that have arisen.
Mr. Lochbaum. Well, the industry does release a lot of
information. There is very little dirty laundry that is
withheld from the American public, that is why we know about
the tornado that hit Surry plant at Brown's Ferry. With the
exception of security information, there is very little
withheld from the public, so I think the industry deserves
credit for that candor.
I think the candor issue is really internally. There is a
failure within the plants themselves sometimes to recognize
problems, that is why Calvert Cliffs had roof leaking for years
that they tolerated but didn't fix, because there was this
complacency or lack of candor about realizing what that could
do that led them to--not to solve the problem they kept seeing
happen over and over again.
Mr. Miller. I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman Broun. Thank you, Mr. Miller.
I thank the witnesses for you all's valuable testimony. If
you are not from the South, you all means all of you all. And
the Members for all of you all's questions. Members of either
Subcommittee may have additional questions of you all, and we
ask that you respond to those in writing. The record will
remain open for the two additional weeks for additional
comments or questions from Members. Witnesses are excused, and
the hearing is now adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:15 p.m., the Subcommittees were
adjourned.]
