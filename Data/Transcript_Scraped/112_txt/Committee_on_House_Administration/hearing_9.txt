----------

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Oversight,
Committee on House Administration,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 1:30 p.m., in
Room 210, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Phil Gingrey
(chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Present: Representatives Gingrey, Nugent, and Gonzalez.
Staff Present: Peter Schaelstock, Deputy General Counsel;
Kimani Little, Parliamentarian; Joe Wallace, Legislative Clerk;
Yael Barash, Assistant Legislative Clerk; Salley Wood,
Communications Director; Linda Ulrich, Director of Oversight;
Dominic Storelli, Oversight Staff; Reynold Schweickhardt,
Oversight Staff; Jamie Fleet, Minority Staff Director; Kyle
Andersen, Minority Press Secretary; Matt Defreitas, Minority
Professional Staff; Khalil Abboud, Minority Elections Staff;
and Mike Harrison, Minority Professional Staff.
Mr. Gingrey. I now call to order the Committee on House
Administration's Subcommittee on Oversight for today's
oversight hearing on the Government Printing Office, the GPO.
The hearing record will remain open for 5 legislative days so
that Members may submit any materials that they wish to be
included therein. A quorum is present so we may proceed.
The Subcommittee on Oversight has the important task of
conducting vigorous and effective oversight of our legislative
and House-related agencies and their operations.
One such agency, the Government Printing Office, is a
historic and proud institution that has served this Nation well
over its 150 years as the printer of record for Congress and
the Federal Government. Its decades long service throughout our
history is a testament to its employees, its institutional
values, and its commitment to our commonly held dedication to
making self-government function.
However, in the 21st century, and the new technology-based
society and the world in which we live, I am interested in
learning how GPO will continue to serve the legislative and
informational needs we have here in Congress, and in the
government, and how GPO will be transforming itself into the
modern day information repository and primary source publisher
it should be.
We live in an age of declining printing and equipment cost
and the ubiquity of web-based technological advances. Yet, we
don't want to worship at the altar of speed and change at the
cost of quality and excellence.
As GPO, the Government Printing Office, moves forward into
the future, what will it look like in 5 years? What will it
look like in 10 years? What specific work will it be performing
and how will it be performing that work? The work of GPO is
multifaceted--U.S. passports, the Congressional Record, the
Federal Register, the Federal Depository Library Program and
the Federal Digital System--all these and more GPO produces and
produces well, but what should their production look like even
years from now?
There have been and are numerous legislative proposals to
significantly reduce the number of paper copies of many GPO
publications. Which proposals make the most sense? How much can
we eliminate, thus saving the American taxpayer hundreds of
thousands of dollars?
These are all questions and issues I hope we discuss today
as we continue to reduce government spending, promote a culture
of savings over debt, and make sure our American taxpayers'
hard-earned dollars are wisely and frugally allocated.
My colleagues and I are committed to rigorous oversight.
And I want to thank each of them for being here. At this point,
I would like to recognize my colleague, Congressman Gonzalez,
the gentleman from Texas, my good friend, for the purpose of
providing his opening statement. And Charlie, I turn it over to
you.
Mr. Gonzalez. Doctor, thank you very much, and I appreciate
it, Mr. Chairman.
The Government Printing Office is a Federal agency,
obviously, with a storied 150-year history, as the chairman has
pointed out. The printing industry of course has changed a
great deal in that time and it is wholly appropriate for us to
be holding this hearing today to see what obviously the future
holds for us in the eyes of our printer. Indeed, recent years
have witnessed some struggles at GPO while GPO has been
producing digital versions of the Congressional Record since
before most people had ever heard of the Internet, the creation
of the Federal Digital System, the new Web site for public
documents, has run far over budget and is behind schedule. We
have also seen some past questionable spending and hiring
practices throughout the agency as well with the Inspector
General expressing continuing concerns about the agency's human
capital operations and management.
That is one reason I am so pleased to see Bill Boarman take
office as Public Printer this year. It was a real pleasure to
see Mr. Boarman's nomination approved by unanimous voice vote
from the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration on a
motion that came actually from the ranking Republican member of
that committee.
With such a strong and bipartisan endorsement, President
Obama did well in making a recess appointment so that Mr.
Boarman could take the reins at GPO, and I expect to see his
renomination confirmed with the Senate equivalent with all due
speed. In the interim, his recess appointment will allow him to
address at least some of the concerns that I have expressed and
are held by others, a process I understand is already underway.
While it would be too much to expect him to continue the pace
of saving $15 million every 4 months since he has been in
office, this is certainly an impressive beginning.
At our last hearing, I spoke about how fixed costs caused
some of the budget woes decried at the Election Assistance
Commission. When you are speaking of GPO's massive presses, the
fixed costs are even more readily apparent as one of the
witnesses before us today, Mr. Petersen, will later explain.
There is also, however, the fact that GPO already contracts
75 percent of its printing to private companies across the
country. I know I personally have someone in my district and
there may be other members of this committee that also benefit
from those printing contracts. My staff actually spoke to
Thomas Murray, who is President and owner of Litho Press,
Incorporated, in San Antonio which has been doing contract work
for GPO since 1962. Mr. Murray did make some suggestions about
how the contracting process could be improved, and my office
will be sharing those with Mr. Boarman's staff, but the simple
fact is that this is a very welcome business and it is good for
everyone that is involved.
Our government's transparency is always dependent on
providing our citizenry with access to information. For 150
years GPO has done that. The Internet has opened new channels
to the public, and I am pleased to see GPO using them to expand
its reach. We must help them to do so, Mr. Chairman, and this
hearing is a strong first step.
And thank you for your indulgence. And I yield back.
Mr. Gingrey. And I thank the ranking member, Mr. Gonzalez.
And now I would like to introduce our first witness.
Mr. William J. Boarman is the 26th Public Printer of the
United States and Chief Executive Officer, CEO, at GPO, the
Government Printing Office. Possessing a long and distinguished
career in printing and publishing industries, Mr. Boarman has
previously been a printer and has held various positions in the
International Typographical Union. Within the Communications
Workers of America he has been President of the Printing,
Publishing and Media Workers Sector and Senior Vice President.
He has also been President of the Union Printers Home
Corporation and a founding member of the ``Capital That
Matters'' Conference at Harvard Law School.
He was the first ever public member of Maryland's
Commission on Judicial Disabilities. Mr. Boarman has advised
numerous previous Public Printers and was part of the labor-
management team that helped GPO transition to electronic
photocomposition.
Mr. Boarman, thank you for being here today. The committee
has received your written testimony. I will recognize you for 5
minutes to present a summary of that submission. To help you
keep that time, we do have a timing device near the witness
table. The device will emit a green light for 4 minutes and
will turn yellow when 1 minute remains. And when the light
turns red it means your time has expired, and as I am chairing
for the first time the Oversight Subcommittee of the House
Committee on Administration, I promise you that at least today
I will have a light gavel.
Mr. Boarman, please proceed.

STATEMENT OF WILLIAM J. BOARMAN, PUBLIC PRINTER OF THE UNITED
STATES, GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE

Mr. Boarman. Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Gonzalez, for
your kind words about GPO. The employees there appreciate
everything that you have said and I will make sure that they
hear it.
Thank you for the opportunity to be here today. Any day I
get to talk about GPO is a good day for me, and it is an honor
for me to have been appointed by the President as Public
Printer. And it is a pleasure to return to GPO, where I served
as a proofreader some 35 years ago.
At that time, we negotiated the end of the hot metal
typesetting at GPO and the start of the electronic
photocomposition. That was the dawn of the GPO's digital age.
The efficiencies resulting from that historic transition
cut the cost of information products by Congress by more than
two-thirds in real economic terms. GPO has reduced from 8,000
employees at that time to just a little over 2,200 today, fewer
than at any time in the past century. Yet more people have more
access to congressional and Federal agency information through
us than ever before. That is a remarkable achievement.
When I came back to GPO, it was like a tale of two cities.
It was the best of times and it was the worst of times. I found
a workforce dedicated and highly trained and committed to GPO's
mission. I am so proud to be able to lead them each day as they
accomplish amazing things for their customers and especially
Congress every day.
At the same time, I found an agency where overhead costs
had mushroomed by 50 percent in the past 5 years. I found an
agency top heavy with senior level managers, some of whom spent
what was, in my opinion, an excessive amount of time on travel,
including an astonishing amount of travel overseas. And I also
found that the development of major essential systems like
FDsys and our financial systems was in the hands of expensive
contractors.
GPO's Chief Financial Officer, instead of reporting
directly to the head of the agency, was buried several layers
below the organization, and there was a growing volume of
uncollected bills to Federal agencies that GPO seemed unable to
resolve. This pattern of excessive spending and costs was
simply unsustainable.
Since taking office on January 3, we cut our appropriations
requests for fiscal year 2012 by more than $5 million from what
was originally submitted to OMB last year. We cut GPO's annual
spending plan as previously submitted to the Joint Committee on
Printing by $15 million and we reduced the number of senior
level managers. We implemented controls on hiring, travel and
related discretionary accounts to stem the flow of spending in
these areas. We realigned GPO's organization so that the Chief
Financial Officer reports directly to me. We created a task
force to recover outstanding payments from Federal agencies, a
problem I have been told had been left unresolved for 7 years.
We worked with the Appropriations Committee to resolve our
funding for fiscal year 2011 at about $135.1 million. This is a
significant reduction from the continuing level of $147.4
million and a far cry from the $166.6 million requested by GPO
management last year.
With reduced funding, we are doing more with less. We
implemented a project to make Federal Court opinions available
online. We expanded our partnership with Google Books. We have
identified additional building space we can make available for
use of the legislative branch.
Now we know Congress' need for printing is changing. To
address that issue, we have launched a comprehensive online
survey of congressional offices about their need for printing
products from the GPO. This is the first time this has ever
been done. GPO can operate more efficiently in support of
Congress, but we have to be beware of false economies opting
for a printing system that relies on expensive office printers.
We also need to be very careful about acquiring equipment whose
reliability has not been soundly tested under the punishing
conditions that frequently characterize congressional printing.
These can be far more costly and less reliable than what we are
using now. Our investments funds have been significantly
reduced, which makes it even more important that any equipment
acquisitions be made wisely.
GPO has always been up front and center in providing
Congress with the information products it needs. With the
measures that we have put in place since January, we will be
able to continue that record.
Mr. Chairman, this concludes my opening remarks, and I
would be very pleased to answer any questions from you and
members of the committee.

Mr. Gingrey. Mr. Boarman, we thank you very much for your
testimony. A vote has been called on the House floor I think
about 1:38 p.m. Or thereabouts, so the time is not totaling, it
is running. The subcommittee will now go into a short recess so
that members may proceed to the floor to vote.
Now, we have six votes. The first one, of course, is a 15-
minute plus a few, and I think the other five votes are 2-
minute votes. So it may be an hour or 45 minutes to an hour
before we can reconvene.
Typically, Mr. Boarman, members would have an opportunity
now to ask you questions and then hear the testimony of the
second panel and then to ask questions of that second panel of
witnesses. Obviously, I don't want to try to rush through and
hear the testimony of the second panel. I am just going to ask
you all to take a deep breath and go somewhere and kick your
feet up and relax and we will be back here in 45 minutes to an
hour to continue. And what we will do at that time is we will
ask questions of the first witness, the Honorable William
Boarman.
The committee is now recessed.
[Recess.]
Mr. Gingrey. The committee will come to order. My 45-minute
estimate was about like my 10-second hundred yard dash; took a
little bit longer than I anticipated.
We now have a time for committee members to ask questions
of the witness. Each member is allotted 5 minutes to question
the witness. To help each member to track the time we will use
the timing device on the witness table. We will alternate back
and forth among the--and actually I should say between the
majority and the minority, as there is just the two of us here
at this time. And I will begin by recognizing myself for 5
minutes.
Mr. Boarman, GPO has indicated that approximately 70
percent of our printing costs are pre-press, in essence getting
to document to the point of PDF. At the Rules Committee we are
testing a hearing management system that would automatically
generate a PDF document as a part of the normal work of the
committee. This would reduce that document's pre-press cost to
essentially zero.
What are your ideas for the Government Printing Office to
make cost reductions similar to what they are doing in the
Rules Committee?
Mr. Boarman. Well, Mr. Chairman, I am not aware of what the
Rules Committee is doing. I did read that I think yesterday in
the committee's program for today. But I doubt, without knowing
it, I doubt whether the constraints and the responsibilities
placed on them come anywhere near to what we have to do each
night for the Congress.
First of all, what we do depends on your work schedule, and
we respond to what your needs are. And that could be, you know,
we could have a 20-page record, we could have a 400-page
record. And we never know until the copy ends coming in.
And I would just like to make one sort of a dramatic
presentation, not for any other reason to I think convince
those present how difficult this is. This is the April 6, 2011
Congressional Record. It is 184 pages. And that is, I am told,
a typical version of the Congressional Record that we would
publish on a daily basis. There are bigger ones than this, but
this is sort of a typical.
If I may, this is what we received. You can see that it is
probably at least 12 inches of copy that comes to the GPO. Now,
it doesn't all come at one time. It comes over in dribs and
drabs from the Clerk and from the Secretary of the Senate as it
is ready to process.
Now, I want to make it clear that we don't have to typeset
all of this. A lot of it comes over in machine readable form.
And so what happens is that the supervisors as it gets to the
proof room and the pre-press area they pass it out among the
workers and usually this is done late at night, late on the
night shift or early in the morning on our third shift, and
each one of them takes responsibility for a piece of this. And
they examine it, they authenticate it, they proofread it, copy
marks are made on that, that has to be set, and some of it has
to be set. Many times early in the morning, maybe as late as
1:30, 2 o'clock in the morning, we will get as much as this
copy that has to be completely typeset and proofread and
authenticated in addition to what we have to do with the rest
of it.
And then miraculously, sometime early in the morning
usually about 5:30, 6 in the morning we are able to put this up
online.
Mr. Gingrey. Let me interrupt you just for a follow-up
because my time is limited, Mr. Boarman. Thank you for that
response. But I have been told that in a typical printing
company that the two greatest costs for a printed job are paper
and labor. And if you look at GPO's current head count in plant
operations are 70 percent of employees employed during pre-
press operations and, if not, how did you get to that number?
Mr. Boarman. Well, that is the actual costs. I mean our
financial department tells us exactly what the costs are by
segment and, no, 70 percent of the people do not work in pre-
press.
Mr. Gingrey. Okay. Well, my time is just about expired, and
at this point I will yield to my colleague from Texas, Mr.
Gonzalez, for 5 minutes of his questioning.
Mr. Gonzalez. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.
And thank you, Mr. Boarman, for your service and being here
and your patience and we are going to hear from some other
witnesses in a minute. But I think that we all have really it
is the same goal, and one is make sure that you do your job and
you want to do your job and we are looking at efficiencies and
it seems like we are coming up with a bunch of different ideas
and some will be suggested by the other witnesses, and I always
look at that as constructive advice. Some people say, ``Well
that is criticism'' or whatever, but I would like to keep this
in very positive tone. But first and foremost, when we think of
you as a printer you are not a printer in the traditional sense
because of the legal requirements that are imposed on you, what
we expect from you, and what your duties and goals should be.
But let's just start off with more or less who are you and what
are you, and Mr. Petersen will be testifying later.
In his written testimony this is the way he describes the
GPO. ``The Federal Government's primary centralized resource
for producing, procuring, cataloguing, indexing,
authenticating, disseminating and preserving the official
information products of the United States Government in digital
and tangible forms.'' So I think we start off with a very
unique definition that is going to impact maybe even some of
the suggestions and recommendations that may be made in good
faith from outside sources, and that is not to prejudge what
some of those recommendations may be.
However, I am going to turn now to some of the written
testimony as submitted by Mr. Belcher, and again I think this
is going to be very constructive and this is what he states and
he will be able to explain it. The GPO currently has very
little management visibility in tracking reporting capability
as the procuring process is not run through a print procurement
software tool.''
Then I will go to page 3. ``By implementing a print
procurement software platform, the GPO should be able to take
out 30 percent or more of the cost to buy print.''
Now, what I am interpreting, that is the stuff that you
outsource, I take it that you contract with one of my
constituents, and so--this is terrible and I am joking so that
if it is on the record people know it is a joke--if there is
going to be 30 percent cost savings. Do you mind leaving San
Antonio out of those and make sure Mr. Murray still has his
contract. As much as I joke about that, that is what many times
ails us.
But how do you respond to that particular suggestion?
Mr. Boarman. Well, I don't know where the 30 percent figure
comes from. I had some discussions with Mr. Belcher today and
he would like to have some more discussion with us and I am
obviously open to that.
I think that we do have a procurement system in place that
has been time tested. We contract out $500 million worth of
work to the private sector. It goes to the lowest bidder. If
you cut that by 30 percent, I am not sure anybody would bid on
it because some of these contracts are pretty low. But as you
know in San Antonio, I was there recently. I met with the head
of the Chamber of Commerce and talked about the dollars that we
put into the San Antonio area, and there is a number of
companies right around there that depend heavily on this
contracting.
So I am anxious to hear more from Mr. Belcher. And I am
certainly open to any suggestions. In my testimony I talked
about the charge-back problem, and that is part of the
procurement issue. So certainly I am not going to close my ears
to any ideas to help me overcome what I think is one of the
most significant problems I face as Public Printer today,
collecting these charge-backs from agencies who have taken the
money back because of some billing error.
Mr. Gonzalez. Now you have just been in charge a very short
period of time, and I have got a minute left and I would like
to ask you how we can help you? What you are saying is that
there are Federal agencies and departments that haven't paid
their bills.
Mr. Boarman. Well, there is a charge-back--this is all new
to me coming from the private sector. There is something called
IPAC at the State Department--I mean at the Treasury Department
rather--and agencies can collect money from each other for
services rendered. And so if we do a job for Agriculture and
say it is $295,000 then we would add our 7 percent surcharge
and we would reach into their account and pull out 300 and some
thousand dollars; a week or two later because of the billing
error it may be $10,000, they reach in and pull the whole thing
back, and then it stops. And that is what I found. And that is
what I am going to try to get my arms around. I have got a task
force of good people who are going to work on that so that we
can get behind that.
I don't know whether it is a legislative problem, Mr.
Chairman. I would like to think about your proposal. Obviously,
I would take help from anybody to solve this problem because it
is going to help me capitalize when it comes to equipment if I
can collect this money.
But let's let our task force do our job, and I certainly
will keep in touch with you and your staff about this, and if
there is a way we think you can help us we will certainly come
to you.
Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, my time is
up, Mr. Chairman, so I am going to yield back.
Mr. Gingrey. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Boarman, thank you for your testimony and your patience
with our legislative schedule today.
Other members of the subcommittee may indeed have some
additional questions that they will submit to you in writing,
and I would ask you to please respond in a reasonable period of
time.
But we thank you very much for being with us today, and at
this time I am going to dismiss you and call on the second
panel. Thank you.
Mr. Boarman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Gingrey. I would now like to introduce the witnesses
for our second panel.
Mr. Eric Belcher is the President and CEO at InnerWorkings,
a global provider of managed print and promotional solutions.
He joined InnerWorkings in June 2005 and has served as Chief
Operating Officer and Executive Vice President of Operations.
He has also worked in printing equipment manufacturing and
distributing and international management consulting. Mr.
Belcher has an MBA from Chicago Booth and a B.A. from Bucknell
University.
The second witness on the panel is, let me just go in my
order because I can't see that far, Mr. James Hamilton is Group
Director of InfoTrends' On Demand Printing & Publishing,
Jetting Technology Opportunities and Wide Format Printing
Consulting Services. Yes, all of that.
Mr. Hamilton has been involved in the graphic arts and
publishing industries since 1980 and has been a member of
InfoTrends' On Demand Printing & Publishing Consulting Service
since 1995. Prior to joining InfoTrends Mr. Hamilton worked at
Linotype-Hell as an Applications Analyst and author of the
company's Technical Information Series. He has an Master's of
Science in Printing Technology from Rochester Institute of
technology and a B.A. from Amherst College.
Last but not least Dr. Eric Petersen is a Specialist in
American National Government at the Congressional Research
Service, where he has worked for 11 years. His areas of
responsibility include congressional and legislative branch
administrative operations and government contingency planning.
In addition to his service at CRS, Dr. Petersen teaches at
Virginia Tech in the Department of Political Science and has
taught at the State University of New York system at Syracuse
University and at the Catholic University of America. He holds
a Bachelor's Degree from the University of Pennsylvania, a
Master's in Public Administration from Virginia Tech and a
Master's and Ph.D. from Syracuse University.
And we appreciate all three of our witnesses being here
today and again we appreciate your patience.
The committee has received your written testimonies. At the
appropriate time I will recognize each of you for 5 minutes to
present a summary of that submission. To help you keep that
time, we have a timing device near the witness table. The
device will emit a green light for 4 minutes and will turn
yellow when 1 minute remains. When the light turns red, it
means your time has expired.
We are going to start with Mr. Belcher.
And Mr. Belcher, you are on for 5 minutes.

STATEMENTS OF ERIC D. BELCHER, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, INNERWORKINGS, INC.; JAMES HAMILTON, GROUP DIRECTOR,
INFOTRENDS; AND ERIC PETERSEN, SPECIALIST IN AMERICAN NATIONAL
GOVERNMENT, CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE

STATEMENT OF ERIC D. BELCHER

Mr. Belcher. Great. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman
and members of the committee. Again, my name is Eric Belcher,
and I am the CEO of InnerWorkings. We are a public company that
does only one thing; our sole core competency is the ability to
source printed material. We procure print on behalf of
corporations.
We have been in business for about 10 years. We have been a
public company for about 4 or 5 years, and this year our public
guidance is to do 590 to $620 million worth of revenue. Our
spend, our revenue is growing very, very rapidly, and the
primary reason is because for the first time that we know of
there is in our technology platform sophisticated use of
information, of data, of print procurement data being deployed
in order to make the best decision on a job-by-job basis
regarding a piece of printed material.
Now, our corporation advocates that companies who don't
claim their sole core competency is the ability to source print
outsource that function to us, and we work with companies like
Unilever and InterContinental Hotels and John Deere. They in
turn benefit from our procurement technology, which primarily
consists of an order management platform to make the process of
bidding out the work, issuing POs, ultimately invoicing our
clients as efficient and streamlined as possible, and it also
consists, our databases also consist of procurement tools that
allow us to match on a job-by-job basis a specification with
the appropriate manufacturing configuration.
We work with 4,000 printers around the world to source our
product and we have 8,000 printers in our databases.
We ultimately believe that the trend in print procurement
is to utilize data and information versus the way in which it
is done in most private corporations right now, which is a
reliance on relationships with local, regional print
manufacturing facilities and historical relationships. We
believe that the use of data in procuring printed material,
because of the complexity of the product, is ultimately the
future, and our growth I think illustrates that even with some
companies that are able to procure print very, very
effectively, gang running, using reverse auctions, very
talented professionals in place, we are able to demonstrate
savings of 20, 30 percent, and in some cases more, by plugging
in our business model and our technology.
So I am very pleased to be here today to talk about our
approach, our databases, how we use them, and how, were the
government to adopt some of the best practices coming out of
private industry, what the potential might be in working
together. We believe we are now buying just a little bit more
than the GPO, but we couldn't have said that a few years ago by
any stretch of the imagination. And so again I am very pleased
to be here today.

STATEMENT OF JAMES HAMILTON

Mr. Hamilton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I am Jim Hamilton. I am a Group Director at InfoTrends. My
expertise area is production printing and publishing.
Before I get started, I would like to ask permission to
submit a report for the record which provides some statistical
backup to the brief testimony I will give now. It is called
Transitioning to Digital. I believe you have received a hard
copy of that.
Mr. Gingrey. Without objection.

Mr. Hamilton. Thank you.
The United States Government Printing Office's core mission
is to produce, protect, preserve and distribute documents of
our democracy. When the GPO was founded 150 years ago, the only
feasible method of producing, protecting, preserving, and
distributing was, of course, in print. And now today with a
multitude of electronic distribution methods available that has
changed. An appropriate question for today is what is the best
method or what are the best methods of producing, protecting,
preserving and distributing any type of document?
Now, I would like to talk about some technology trends that
are impacting the answer to that question.
Print used to be the central distribution method. It is not
anymore. Traditional print reproduction methods which are best
suited to manufacturing many copies of the same content are
under very increasing pressure to meet tight deadlines and to
produce economic short runs of the most up-to-date and targeted
information.
Now digital print methods are well established today for
short run, quick turnaround, targeted and personalized work.
Offset printing technology, though while it is under attack,
still has some compelling economic reasons for continued use.
And then for pure electronic delivery, high speed Internet
connectivity and mobile phone technologies have enabled
information delivery in ways that are impossible for print to
achieve today.
Now, while we are looking at technology trends, there are
also industry trends that are important. Market consolidation
among commercial printers has reduced the number of sites
significantly over the past 2 decades, while at the same time
industry employment levels have also dropped.
Concurrently, automated work flow tools have allowed
workers to become much more productive, and this has resulted
in an increase in revenue produced per worker.
On the content side, digital delivery of information has
many key advantages, which I am sure you are seeing. The ease
of searching, the inclusion of live hyperlinks, media, the
ability to access content very quickly, portability from one
place to the next, tight control of content and the ability to
update as needed. But print continues to have significant value
as a content delivery method through its physical aspects--lack
of a requirement for an electronic device to read it, the
ability to easily archive, annotation, to read without worrying
about electricity or battery life and, of course, the ease of
recycling paper.
Another interesting point is that print is egalitarian in
the sense that it doesn't require high tech devices or monthly
service plans.
Publishers and other content providers have seen how
digital print and electronic delivery can be used in
combination to create a data warehouse of documents that allows
books to be ordered as they are needed.
Now, print's move to secondary status happened over a
period of about 20 years. The Internet, cell phones, mobile
connectivity all have contributed to that shift. Adjusting to
such a massive change isn't easy. InfoTrends has seen firsthand
how private and public organizations have refocused on the use
of content and how it is captured, formatted, distributed and
archived. The GPO's leadership role in this transition is well
acknowledged in the industry.
Moving forward, the challenge for all will be to meet the
document user's need for accurate information delivered in the
most effective means. With technology changing at such a rapid
pace and a requirement to preserve documents with an eye
towards history, this is no easy task. So what we see, a
multichannel approach is the goal. Doing so takes advantage of
the best of each method. So one, the low cost manufacturing
benefits of conventional printing presses; two, the short run,
quick turnaround, targeted and personalized benefit of digital
print; and, three, the timely, immediate and mobile benefits of
electronic delivery through a global connected network.
Now understanding how the GPO executes on such an approach
requires a clear knowledge of the purpose of each document and
the needs of the customers served. With that in hand, assessing
the current and future production requirements for the GPO
becomes feasible.
So thank you for the opportunity to address the committee.
I welcome any questions you have as follow-up.

Mr. Petersen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Since its establishment 150 years ago, GPO has reflected
transformations in private sector printing, publishing and
information management concerns. In the past four decades
especially, these industries have addressed the emergence of
electronic printing and distribution. Mass produced printed
products were the focus of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today,
smaller quantities of paper copies of government publications
are available, but most information is accessible without
charge to the end-user in electronic form through the Internet.
According to GPO, approximately 97 percent of all U.S.
Government documents are born digital; that is, they are
published electronically and available through the Internet and
will never be printed. What this means is that some of the
materials are more readily available to wider audiences than
they were when they were produced only in paper form.
And in light of some of these changes, it has been argued
that eliminating more paper copies of congressional and
executive branch documents could result in further cost and
resource savings.
At the same time, current law regarding document
production, authentication and preservation, as well as some
user demand, require that a number of paper-based documents be
produced and distributed as part of the official record of
governmental proceedings.
Several initiatives, including legislative proposals and
administrative activities in Congress and the executive branch
have been introduced to further reduce costs in paper copies.
These efforts focus on the potential savings that could result
from producing fewer paper copies. Some savings may result, but
it is not clear that they will necessarily be as extensive as
various proponents claim. In part this is because the expenses
associated with producing even a small number of paper copies
can eat into the savings. Another cost concern related to
producing paper copies, and I guess it is important here to
distinguish between mass produced paper copies that are
comparatively inexpensive coming from GPO or another printing
concern, and individually produced copies from a laser printer
or an enterprise copy center which are considerably more
expensive. Taken together, whether you are going with
centralized copies or the individually printed copies, any of
the savings are likely to be eaten up in that kind of
productivity.
In addition to the cost concerns, reducing the number of
paper copies raises questions about access to government
materials to folks who do not have access to the Internet or
high speed versions of the Internet. It also raises questions
about the capacity to archive the records of government and
retrieve those materials in the future.
In these cases, a reduction in the number of paper copies
could reduce the transparency of government activities for some
and reduce the availability of a complete, enduring archival
record of government activities.
Today's hearing was called to consider how GPO will
transition to the future. At this point, the way forward
appears unclear. The agency is at a crossroads with obligations
to continue to produce products in essentially the same manner
as it has for 150 years, printed version, and at the same time
engage newer responsibilities to manage an ongoing transition
to an environment where information is collected,
authenticated, reproduced and distributed through an ever-
growing variety of outlets.
Some of the challenges facing the agency appear to include
questions about what efficiencies might still be achieved in
the short term, as well as a thorough consideration of how the
agency might evolve over a longer term.
I would like to just focus on a couple of the challenges
the agency and Congress may face as they consider new policy.
First, it appears that the statutory authorities, may not
reach the full spectrum of GPO activities and capacities. With
the exception of a law enacted in 1993 regarding the electronic
publication of certain documents, statutes governing the
activities of GPO have not changed since the late 1960s, just
before the first inroads of the transition to electronic
information occurred.
In addition to that, the detailed requirements for the
distribution of paper copies or a variety of documents that are
no longer produced, those that remain are produced in smaller
than authorized quantities. In addition, the current business
model under which GPO operates is arguably overreliance on
printing as a means of generating income, and there are no
explicit provisions to meet the cost of upgrading technological
infrastructures.
I see my time has expired. I think in conclusion I would
say the manner in which GPO transitions to the future may rest
in part in how some of these concerns are addressed.
I appreciate again the opportunity to be invited to
testify, and I will be happy to address any questions you may
have.

Mr. Gingrey. Dr. Petersen, we thank you. And I would like
to thank all of the witnesses on this second panel for your
patience and your testimony today.
To expedite the hearing, the members of the subcommittee
will submit questions to you in writing, and as I asked the
first witness, we would ask you also that you respond to these
questions in a reasonable period of time.
And I now ask unanimous consent to enter the following
documents into the hearing record, first a statement of the
Honorable Karen Haas, Clerk of the House, regarding the
relationship between the House and the Government Printing
Office in the production of documents; secondly, a statement of
John Landwehr of the Adobe Corporation regarding options to
increase value of electronic publications; and third, the
Office of Management and Budget memorandum M-11-18 written by
Jeff Zients regarding reduction of the use of paper copies of
the Federal Register within the executive branch.
Without objection to this request, it is so ordered.

Mr. Gingrey. I would now like to turn to my colleague, the
ranking member, Mr. Gonzalez, for any concluding remarks or
requests.
Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. There is
going to be a unanimous consent request to tender into the
record the written testimony of Suzanne Eileen Sears, who is
the Assistant Dean for Public Services, University of North
Texas Libraries, on the value, in essence on the value of the
printed paper copies of the Congressional Record, Federal
Register and other GPO products to professional researchers and
archivists.
Among other points, Ms. Sears would note that the longevity
of digital materials for archiving has not been tested and that
many libraries have diskettes and CDs that no longer work or
cannot be accessed. I would ask unanimous consent.
Mr. Gingrey. Without objection, so ordered.
[The statement of Ms. Sears follows:]
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 67450A.087

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 67450A.088

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 67450A.089

Mr. Gonzalez. Mr. Chairman, my understanding is we are
going to be submitting written questions; is that correct?
Mr. Gingrey. That is correct.
Mr. Gonzalez. But just a real quick observation.
I think all of you have so much to add and to assist us.
And Mr. Belcher, I am really curious about your aspect. Mr.
Petersen has indicated that 97 percent of what GPO does is
digital anyway. It is not really printed. But then we still
have a tremendous investment going out there in the printed
word on paper and such, and the fact that there may be some way
to reduce that particular cost is obviously very, very
attractive. And I appreciate you meeting with Mr. Boarman.
The other thing, Mr. Chairman, it has been reported out of
the Senate Rules Committee today or at least favorably Mr.
Boarman's nomination. And so hopefully he will be going to the
Senate floor.
And with that, I yield back, And thank you for your
courtesies.
Mr. Gingrey. I thank the distinguished ranking member and
congratulations are in order to Mr. Boarman.
Again, let me thank both panels of witnesses, and I
appreciate your patience in particular with our schedule.
With that, the Subcommittee on Oversight of the Committee
on House Administration hearing is adjourned.
