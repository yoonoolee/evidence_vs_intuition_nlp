The Chairman. All right. The committee is back in session
to hear from the Ways and Means Committee chairman and ranking
member about their work for this year and the budget. We have
all of the voluminous material that you have sent to us on
personnel, on oversight, on other expenditures. If you have a
prepared statement, that would be part of the record. But we
are very interested in seeing what you have to say. Thank you
for coming.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. DAVE CAMP, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN

Mr. Camp. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Lungren,
Ranking Member Brady and members of the committee. I am here
today to present the proposed budget for the Committee on Ways
and Means for the 112th Congress, and I am joined by our
ranking member and my friend from Michigan Mr. Levin.
In accordance with our committee rules, the members of the
Ways and Means Committee have already met and approved the
budget before you. Before we get into the details of the
budget, I would just like to make a couple of points.
First and foremost, this budget reflects our Nation's
current financial problems and the sacrifices many Americans
have been forced to make as the unemployment rate has been
stuck at or about 9 percent for nearly the last 2 years. Just
as these families have had to cut back, we think it is
appropriate for the committee to cut back. As such, we proposed
cutting the committee's budget as compared to the last Congress
by a total of 5 percent, a savings of over $1 million for the
American taxpayers.
Second, I would note that we have held flat the number of
staff allotted to the committee and have reduced the funding
allocated toward staff salaries.
That concludes my statement. I would be prepared to answer
any questions that the committee may have.
[The statement of Mr. Camp follows:]

The Chairman. Mr. Levin.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. SANDER M. LEVIN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN

Mr. Levin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Brady and your
colleagues.
On behalf of the minority, I express full support for this
budget. We were fully consulted. It represents the cut that Mr.
Camp has suggested. As you can see, our funding goes very much
for salaries, and we receive our full share.
I would just like to add, I did leaf through a lot of this
detail, or some of it, and I just want to add--I know Mr. Camp
believes this fully--our staffs work very, very hard, and
everybody should understand the long hours that they undertake
to work on behalf of the committee within the rules that are
incumbent upon us.
I just want to add that because Mr. Camp and I have been
working with the staffs over the years, and I don't want to say
it is the hardest-working staff, because your staff would not
like me to say that, but there is no staff that works harder
than the Ways and Means Committee.
So I join in urging your support of this proposal. Thank
you.
The Chairman. Thank you very much.
[The statement of Mr. Levin follows:]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6808A.004

The Chairman. You allocate your resources between majority
and minority in a way that is satisfactory to the two of you?
Mr. Levin. Yes.
Mr. Camp. We do. Historically it has always been a one-
third/two-third ratio. That was the allocation when I was in
the minority. That is the allocation now that I represent the
majority. We have had a tradition of that on the committee, and
that continues.
The Chairman. Do you have any shared staff?
Mr. Camp. Shared staff with other committees? Between
ourselves?
The Chairman. No, professional staff. Or is it all majority
and minority?
Mr. Camp. Responsibilities are divided along majority and
minority, but they do work closely together, developing
important legislation. So there is a lot of consultation
between the staffs.
The Chairman. And the 5 percent decrease in funds, where
specifically or mostly did you achieve your savings?
Mr. Camp. We reduced our personnel costs. We held flat our
number of filled staff positions. We limited some underlying
budget items, specifically equipment and travel, and we
streamlined some of our processes to better utilize electronic
resources.
The Chairman. Mr. Levin.
Mr. Levin. That is what we did. Obviously we had a loss of
personnel. This has happened before, and the two staffs worked
together. You will see this detailed. It took a long period of
time to put it together. It was done so carefully with maximum
attention to efficiency.
The Chairman. Have you been able to utilize technology to
create some of those efficiencies? Some of the committees have
come in and talked about the technology fixes they had last
year which they think will assist them during this Congress.
Mr. Levin. We will be using advanced videoconferencing and
chat technology that will allow some interaction via secure on-
line areas, which I think will in turn help reduce some of the
e-mails, phone calls, face-to-face meetings, allowing Members
and staff to utilize resources better. So we do intend to do
that.
The Chairman. Mr. Brady.
Mr. Camp. I did also want to mention, we will use video-
streaming services for publishing live and archived video of
committee activities. That will be a new activity this year.
Mr. Brady. Good morning, Chairman, Ranking Member. Thank
you for appearing in front of us today. I have no questions.
The Chairman. All right. Mr. Harper.
Mr. Harper. No questions, Mr. Chairman.
Mrs. Lofgren. No questions.
The Chairman. Mr. Nugent.
Mr. Nugent. No questions.
The Chairman. This is relatively painless.
Mr. Brady. You know, when we have no money to give extra,
it is really painless. If we had some money to give out, we
would be much more important.
Mr. Camp. Thank you. I just also wanted to second what
Sandy said, about how hard-working the staff is, in both
preparing these documents, but also throughout the year. I do
think we have folks that are very dedicated to trying to do the
people's business in the best way possible.
The Chairman. I appreciate that, and I appreciate the fact
that we have received the documentation for the work that you
do. We have got to prove to the American people that we are
doing a good job, and that we are getting value out of the
taxpayer dollars we are spending, and that is why we go through
this exercise. Every committee has come before us having filled
out the forms, given us the information, allowed us to go
through it, and it is a situation this year where we are not in
a position of looking at enhancing any budgets whatsoever.
Everybody has come to us with a 5 percent cut, although I will
say Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, actually came in
with over a 10 percent cut, but that is because they had some
additional funds they had to use last year for impeaching
judges, and thus far we haven't found any judges we want to
have come before us that way.
I thank both of you.
The Chairman. Good morning. Welcome to the chair and
ranking member. We have your written submissions, if I can get
to it, dealing with your personnel costs, oversight, other
costs, consulting contracts and so forth. If you have written
statements, they will be made part of the record. We would also
like to hear from you. So you can tell us how well the two of
you work together, and how well the committee is doing, and how
you are going to manage with a 5 percent cut.
Ileana.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you very much, Chairman Lungren,
thank you Ranking Member Brady and members of the committee for
the opportunity for Howard and me to appear before you.
If we are to provide for our Nation's security, we must
also be able to effectively address not just the immediate
threats, but also learn from the developments such as the
recent turmoil in the broader Middle East, prioritize our
efforts toward preventing the emergence of future threats, and
as our oversight plan denotes, we have a robust agenda planned
for the 112th Congress to properly assess, develop and
implement legislative strategies that are going to help us
achieve those desired objectives.
We believe, given the sizable surplus the committee had
last year, that we can accomplish this ambitious goal despite
the reduced budget for this Congress. The budget of the
Committee on Foreign Affairs reflects the 5 percent cut in
spending from the combined 2-year total budget from last
Congress, and it reflects the high esteem that I hold for my
good friend, my colleague from California, Ranking Member
Berman, and the respect for minority rights through a majority-
minority distribution that better guarantees minority access to
one-third of the committee's resources and provides the
minority with an enhanced personnel budget allocation over
which they have full control.
The committee's budget clearly illustrates a renewed
emphasis on oversight, transparency and accountability by
allocating greater resources for new media, investigative
travel and field hearings. The field hearings are also aimed at
involving the American people more directly in the discussion
of our U.S. foreign policy, our policy priorities, our
international affairs budget.
In furtherance of this more responsive approach to the work
we perform, the main committee Web site now has a new
interactive feature called ``Your Seat on the Dais,'' and we
are changing it to ``You Ask the Question,'' which is more
direct. This feature allows members of the public to submit
questions that they would like to have answered by the
panelists who are appearing before us, and the committee will
review the submissions, and some of the questions will be
selected by our members, who will then ask the question on
behalf of the submitter during the hearing. We tried that
yesterday when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appeared
before our committee, and that worked well.
The majority staff now boasts an oversight and
investigative team comprised of a chief counsel and two other
full committee staff members, in addition to the staff of the
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. We have also
instituted an oversight referral process similar to the
legislative referral mechanism, and have added an interactive
feature on our main committee Web site for whistleblowers to
help us identify waste, fraud and abuse in the programs and the
operations under the committee's areas of jurisdiction.
With respect to the House Democracy Partnership and the Tom
Lantos Human Rights Commission, which fall under the
committee's jurisdiction, the travel and hearings of these two
committees are now more closely coordinated with and integrated
into the committee's activities. The committee budget reflects
administrative costs for these two entities.
Salary for the two dedicated House staff members for the
House Democracy Partnership are paid in full from the
Republican majority salary allotment. In honoring the memory
and legacy of our dear colleague and deceased past chairman of
the committee, Tom Lantos, the Republican majority funds a
designated staff position for Chairman Wolf on the Tom Lantos
Human Rights Commission.
Further, with respect to interparliamentary groups, we are
undertaking a rigorous review of the accounts of these IPGs and
identifying excess funds towards returning them immediately to
the Treasury. The American people are forced to make difficult
choices to keep their fiscal house in order. We in turn need to
focus on how to do more with less in the running of our
respective committees and approach our review of programs,
agencies and budgets under our jurisdiction with the same mind-
set, doing more with less, and I believe that our funding
resolution reflects this commitment.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Brady and
members of the committee.
The Chairman. Thank you very much for the presentation.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. HOWARD L. BERMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

Mr. Berman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and my
thanks to both you and Ranking Member Brady and your staffs for
the assistance they have provided to the minority staff of the
Foreign Affairs Committee in all of this. I want to
particularly thank not in the pro forma way we sometimes thank
our colleagues, but particularly a really heartfelt thanks to
our Chairman, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and to her staff director,
Dr. Yleem Poblete, for really helping us to shape a budget
request that I think is fair.
Switching from the majority to the minority is always
difficult. I hear if it doesn't kill you, it makes you
stronger, but it has been especially challenging as a result of
the decision to reduce the budget from last year's number, as
the chairman mentioned, and straight-line the budget into next
year. But Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen has been very, very
helpful in providing assistance that our staff needed to make
the transition, and I do appreciate her generosity.
As was the case with the minority in previous Congresses,
we anticipate coordinating well with the chair on receiving
one-third of all nonpersonnel expenses in each expense
category, travel, communications and equipment upgrades.
The chairman intends to hold a number of field hearings,
which I think is a good idea, and I am hoping to be able to
make as many as I can, and I look forward to working with her
on a bipartisan basis. You can imagine in foreign affairs you
have a range of issues, and we will have some differences, but
on a bunch of the core issues, I think there is a basis for a
bipartisan approach, and we want to work closely. I am proud to
be a cosponsor of the funding resolution for our committee.
The Chairman. Thank you.
[The statement of Mr. Berman follows:]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6808A.010

The Chairman. These are public hearings, so some members of
the American public get a chance to see what our committees do,
and one of the areas of easy criticism is Members traveling
overseas. I just returned on a congressional delegation headed
up by one of your Members, Congressman Manzullo, and we were in
New Zealand and Australia. And the refrain we heard from the
members of the government there was, we don't see you people
often enough. You are important players--that is, the United
States--in this part of the world, particularly with the rise
of China. We need to hear from you, we need to see you, we need
to talk with you, you need to see what we have here.
It impressed on me the need that we have for visits of this
Congress with Members of Parliament and the governments in
countries like that, and it was very obvious they thought it
was important that we are there. They are both small, but very
important allies.
Maybe you could talk about, even with the 5 percent, what
your committee plans to do with respect to that kind of thing.
You mentioned the interparliamentary groups and any excess
funds going back to the Treasury. But why do we have those,
what do you anticipate doing this year, and how do you do it
majority to minority?
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Well, we have a very good working
relationship, as you can surmise from our presentation here. We
help set up the bipartisan part of the trips. And Members are
interested in all hosts of issues, as Howard pointed out. In
certain areas there is more interest than others because of
their home districts.
I know in your trip, Mr. Chairman, you left that area just
2 hours, 2\1/2\ hours before that devastating earthquake. So
that was an incredible experience. We have heard from Mr.
Manzullo when he came back from the trip, he tells us about the
positive and the negative aspects of the trip.
As you know, the funding comes from the State Department
budget itself, but we help coordinate the travel, we make sure
that there is representation from both parties and the staff is
present, so we provide the working staff to help facilitate the
meeting. So we help in all kinds of coordination of the travel
arrangements and the monies that come from the State Department
budget.
But as of now we have had no difficulty. There have been no
problems. Members are not making any outrageous requests. They
know that this is not the same kind of economic environment as
before, so they are cognizant of that, and no one is making any
requests that would be outlandish.
We are dealing with these interparliamentary groups where
other Members outside of our committee are very involved, and
we want to make sure that we bring down the cost of those in
every opportunity that we can.
So, more with less, that is our mantra, and that includes
trips as well.
The Chairman. Ranking Member Berman, you might be
interested to know in our conversations with the parliamentary
leaders in both countries, we raised the issue of intellectual
property; that there were efforts afoot in both of those
countries to attack the notion of intellectual property as we
understand it here that would put American businesses in
jeopardy. There is a proposal before the New Zealand Parliament
to basically get rid of IP protection for software development.
In Australia, they were considering changing a packaging
law with respect to tobacco by way of basically getting rid of
the trademark protection. We indicated to them that we
understood what they were doing in the area of tobacco, but to
utilize the destruction of intellectual property rights as the
manner to do it would be devastating for developments in the
future, and that it was unacceptable as far as we were
concerned as Members of Congress. Very interesting. It seemed
to get their attention. And when they realized we had a
bipartisan group there, and that we agreed on this, their
response was, we better go back to the drawing board and take a
look at it.
Now, I don't know what the final resolution is going to be,
but it was very interesting in a timely fashion, just
discussing issues of interest between our countries, we raised
an issue that was extremely important to our economy.
Mr. Berman. Well, this doesn't surprise me. I could spend a
great deal of your time, but I won't, giving specific examples
of how specific congressional delegations have ended up making
a difference on both security issues and on economic issues in
terms of America's interests. During my 3 years as chair, I had
an opportunity to lead four different CODELs with my then-
ranking member and current chair.
We went to Afghanistan and Pakistan on a very quick, but
fascinating and educational trip. On another one that you
remember, we went to India and Pakistan. We took a trip to four
countries in Africa and then went to China and Taiwan and South
Korea. On the issue of the intellectual property, in Taiwan
they had done some important advances in their intellectual
property protection, but had sort of ignored the area of
digital, and we raised issues with of the leadership of the
Legislature in Taiwan, and the result was they took actions to
sort of fill that void, a direct consequence being to the
benefit of a lot of U.S. intellectual property owners in terms
of doing business in Taiwan.
I think it is an essential part of what we do. I think
these parliamentary groups done right, avoiding the excesses
and carefully oversighted and controlled, as the committee is
doing now, are helpful to American interests.
The Chairman. Thank you very much.
Mr. Brady.
Mr. Brady. Just to thank the chairlady and ranking member
for being here today. I have no questions. Thank you.
The Chairman. Mr. Harper.
Mr. Harper. We obviously are having to do more with of
less, and, of course, looking at the numbers for your
committee, you know the numbers from the 110th to the 111th was
it looks like about an 8.4 percent increase. So the number we
have now with this 5 percent decrease is still more than you
had during the 110th. Money still is tight, we know, through
this term.
If we get to the 113th and we see we have to scale back
even more, is this something that you feel like you can figure
out a way to make work?
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Absolutely we can. If asked to do it
again and to cut further, we can, and we're able to do it in a
way that is fair to the majority and minority.
Mr. Harper. Okay. Thank you.
The Chairman. Ms. Lofgren.
Ms. Lofgren. Just thank you both for your incredible
efforts. In terms of travel, I know that it is important, and
you bear the brunt of that burden because of your committee
assignments, and the rest of us who don't have to go do that
appreciate your willingness to represent our country in that
way.
I do have a question about security in the
interparliamentary groups. The per diems never go up, so the
accommodations degrade in terms of the cost. That is okay in
terms of where you stay, but it is not okay in terms of the
security issues. I want to make sure if we are sending people
off on these missions, which is important, that we have got
adequate attention to their security. Sometimes the security
provided by a host country may be a little iffy.
Can you address that?
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Yes, and you are so right about that. As
the allotment stays the same or goes down, it means that the
places that you stay may not have the sufficient security that
we would need or would like to have. But we coordinate the
security not necessarily through the host countries, but
through our embassy and through their diplomatic channels, so
they are always aware of where we are and what our needs are,
and they are very accommodating to any particular situation.
In Pakistan, obviously, that is more of a problematic
country, so we are allotted more protection. In other countries
you don't have that security risk. But we coordinate with the
diplomatic posts, our U.S. diplomats on the ground, and we have
not run into any difficulties as of now.
Ms. Lofgren. I would say, Mr. Chairman, if that becomes an
issue for the committee, I, for one, would welcome being told
about it, because I think if we are going to ask our Members to
go off and do this for our country, we need to make sure they
are safe when they do so.
Thank you.
The Chairman. Mr. Rokita.
Mr. Rokita. I have a quick, but, to be quite honest with of
you, it is kind of a substitute question. So to avoid rebuke
from my chairman and ranking member, I am going to put it in
the form of a budget question.
It is about H1Bs. We have an immigration issue that we talk
about, but we have one that we don't talk about. In my district
we have Purdue and IU, and we spend a great deal of money
educating students, only to send them out of our country so
they can become millionaires in their homeland. I would like to
keep these folks.
Does your budget anticipate tackling this issue? I haven't
been able to confer with you guys on the floor.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. I will let Howard take care of that
because he is on Judiciary and has dealt with this for so long.
Mr. Berman. I would love to tackle that issue because I
think our current situation is crazy from our economic security
point of view. The students who are coming and getting
postgraduate degrees in sciences and computer science and so
many areas that could be of tremendous benefit, because of our
current immigration laws aren't--even though they would like
to--aren't able to take the kinds of employment here that would
take that education and return it for their benefit, but also
for the benefit of American companies. But I have a feeling
that were I to tackle that, there would be at least two people
on this committee who would say, that is Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Rokita. Okay. Fair enough.
Mr. Berman. But I think there is a responsive--there are
people who are quite responsive to the issue you have raised on
this committee and on the Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Rokita. I will yield back to the chair.
The Chairman. All I can say is that the gentlelady from
California and I have worked with the gentleman from California
for many years on this, and we would be happy to enlist
additional support.
Ms. Lofgren. Absolutely. We have a bill in circulation
right now. We will see you after the meeting.
Mr. Berman. This is a good opportunity.
The Chairman. Cosponsorships are available at no cost.
Mr. Nugent.
Mr. Nugent. I have no questions.
The Chairman. I want to thank both of you for appearing
before us and outlining your intentions and the spirit of
bipartisanship that you have expressed, and also explaining
somewhat on the record why it is important that you do what you
do and how it benefits the people that we serve here.
Thank you very much.
This is great. We have the Rules Committee coming 5 minutes
early. Mr. Dreier, always the gentleman. That is very nice.
Mr. Dreier. Not always.
Ms. Slaughter. Yes, he is.
The Chairman. Well, I won't ask Ms. Slaughter for a comment
on that.
Thank both of you for coming before us. This is the regular
procedure to consider the budget requests of the various
committees before we offer the omnibus budget resolution. We
all are aware of the 5 percent that was mandated by the
resolution passed on the floor of the House, the first order of
business that we did. We do have your written submissions as to
personnel requirements, oversight responsibilities and other
costs and your statements, but we are very much interested in
hearing from you directly.
So, Mr. Dreier.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. DAVID DREIER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

Mr. Dreier. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Let me begin, with all due respect to Mr. Brady, saying how
much I really enjoy this shift here, and it is nice to see Mr.
Lungren with the gavel. And to Mr. Harper and my California
colleague Ms. Lofgren, with whom I have worked on H1B visas,
and Sheriff Nugent, a member of the Rules Committee, it is
great to be here with my distinguished colleague Ms. Slaughter.
The request before you continues the tradition of lean
funding that has characterized the Rules Committee in the past
during majorities of both parties, but will still allow us to
perform our critical institutional role during the months and
the years ahead.
This marks my fifth appearance before this committee as
chairman of the Committee on Rules. The Rules Committee is both
traffic cop and first responder. We assist the Speaker in
moving the routine business of the majority as fairly as we
possibly can, while at the same time standing ready to respond
in the event of unforeseen circumstances. This makes serving on
the Rules Committee, as Sheriff Nugent can attest,
simultaneously rewarding and challenging.
More than any other standing committee, our members and
staff must be agile to respond to our difficulties endemic to
running a majority. The budget that our ranking member Ms.
Slaughter and I have submitted allows us to maintain our
ability to meet these challenges, while recognizing that all
committees must do their part to control spending.
We are requesting a total budget authority of approximately
$6.8 million, divided equally between this year and next.
Because the committee has been very judicious in its budget
request in the past, this request is $357,000 less than the
committee received in the last Congress, and even about $69,000
less than the committee received in the 110th Congress. This
reflects a 5 percent reduction from our level granted for the
111th Congress.
Just over 90 percent of our requested funds goes to
personnel compensation. The remainder is designated for needed
equipment, supplies and services.
Mr. Chairman, this Congress marks an important turning
point in the Rules Committee's minority/majority relationship.
While in the past the minority has controlled a full one-third
of the personnel compensation budget along with a third of the
staff slots, this year marks the first time that the minority
will be given full control over one-third of the entire budget.
While there have not generally been issues in the past with
the minority receiving funding for needed services or
equipment, this change grants the minority a level of autonomy
that neither party has previously enjoyed. Now, in the
Madisonian spirit of recognition of minority rights, I believe
that this is a very important change that is long overdue.
Even with the cuts we made compared to past years, we are
still funding our important priorities. As we promised in the
Pledge to America, we have opened the deliberations of the
Rules Committee to anyone with an Internet connection.
With of the assistance of the Chief Administrative Officer
and the Clerk, we now Webcast every hearing and meeting of the
committee, and we maintain archives of those recordings on our
Website. We are involved in a pilot program with the same
vendor that provides the services to the Clerk's HouseLive
Program. While we understand that the CAO is looking into a
broader contract with a vendor for all committees, we will
continue working with him individually until that contract is
in place.
Separately, I have asked your committee to fund the
permanent installation of audio and video broadcast equipment
in our hearing room. This will improve the quality of our
broadcasts and allow the CAO to redeploy the equipment he has
loaned the committee to other uses.
We are continuing development of the CORE database and
workflow automation tool. This custom software was started
during the 109th Congress and was significantly improved during
the last 4 years. We will be focusing on improving the
usability of the system as well as extending its capabilities
to integrate it more tightly in our Website.
We are continuing our efforts to improve transparency. We
have started posting the text of bills and resolutions in the
House standard XML format on our Website. We intend to work
closely with the Office of Legislative Counsel and Office of
the Clerk to enable the posting of committee reports and
amendments in this more flexible format as well.
It is also important to note that the Rules Committee
Website is serving as the official repository for the text of
all legislation to be considered on the House floor until your
committee designates another official location for these
documents.
In all, I believe that this is a very fair budget, Mr.
Chairman. It maintains our history of wisely using our
resources and providing the House with a very favorable return
on its investment.
I am happy to take any questions.
The Chairman. Thank you very much.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. LOUISE SLAUGHTER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK

Ms. Slaughter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am happy to be
here with you this morning, Ranking Member Brady and other
members of the committee. It is a pleasure to appear before you
today with Chairman Dreier to discuss the budget request for
the Committee on Rules. We fully support the majority's budget
request, which Mr. Dreier has already laid out to you. I think
it is important to note that the Rules Committee, in spite of
its sometimes partisan outward image, is really one of the most
collegial committees in the House with regard to day-to-day
activities.
Mr. Dreier and I share the unique honor of having served as
both chair and ranking member of our committee. As such, we
share a unique insight into the challenges facing both the
majority and the minority roles, whether it will be handling
one of our infamous late-night meetings or, more to the point
this afternoon, addressing the work of the committee.
With regard to the specifics of the 112th Congress, I want
to express my full support for the chairman's request to reduce
the committee's funding--should I start over?
Mr. Dreier. No. This microphone is very sensitive. You
don't even need a microphone. We can all hear you.
Ms. Slaughter. It was such a shock. Suddenly this Southern
voice comes out of this New York woman.
Mr. Dreier. It is not sudden. It has been going on for a
while.
Ms. Slaughter. That was really quite stunning, to hear that
expressed that loudly.
Anyway, with regard to specifics of the 112th Congress, I
want to express my full support for the chairman's request to
reduce the funding by 5 percent. These are tough economic
times. And even if Mr. Dreier and I sometimes disagree on the
best approach, it is clear that we must tackle this ever-
growing budget deficit. We need to start by setting an example
and cutting our own budgets, and this request does just that. I
am confident that the funds that Mr. Dreier has requested will
be spent wisely and effectively by both the majority and
minority.
We would also like to express our gratitude to the majority
for allowing the practice of many other committees of giving
the minority control over one-third of the committee's budget
for the 112th Congress. In the past, the Rules Committee
majority has controlled the entire budget except staff salary.
In practice, the majority, whether controlled by Democrats or
Republicans, has administered the committee in a collegial,
nonpartisan manner. We appreciate the majority's decision to
formalize that tradition in this year's request.
As we begin the 112th Congress, I am pleased to see the
majority's continued expanding of the transparency initiatives
that we have started in the last 4 years. We both share the
commitment to ensuring that the American people have up-to-the-
minute access, and as ranking member I look forward to working
with Chairman Dreier to continue to make the committee
transparent, fair and responsible.
Thank you.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6808A.017

The Chairman. Thank you very much, both of you.
First of all, I appreciate the fact that now you have a
one-third/two-thirds split across the board, and I hope that
will be the tradition in the future, where it is formalized, as
was suggested by the ranking member.
Secondly, when you appeared before us either last year or
the year before, we had the discussion over cameras in the
Rules Committee room, and I am glad that you moved forward on
that, and that now those hearings are more accessible to the
public-at-large on a continual and regular basis. I think that
is a step forward.
Mr. Dreier. I would like to note for the record, Mr.
Chairman, that our first hearing was only a 12-hour hearing
following installation of those cameras.
The Chairman. I understand that, and I am sure after some
people take the makeup off and so forth, they will find out
maybe they don't have to say as many words, and that is both
members of the committee and witnesses.
Ms. Slaughter. Mr. Lungren, may I say as well, we did
always allow for cameras at our meeting. We allowed whatever
requests were made. C-SPAN and other credentialed media were
specifically invited and encouraged to attend. We take
transparency very seriously. We made transcripts available for
everybody to review, not just Members and the press.
We customarily held our meetings at 3 or 5 p.m. to maximize
attendance and accessibility. We reserved one-third of all
hearing room seats for the press to improve the ease of
coverage. And all relevant committee reports were posted on the
Website to make them more accessible to the public.
This year the majority decided to install permanent cameras
rather than rely on the independent media. As ranking member, I
am happy that has been done. We set some responsible
guidelines, however. Our rule on our side, which was
unanimously adopted, ensures coverage of every meeting in full,
and that proceedings are archived to be made available via the
Internet.
So I remain ready to work with the chairman on
transparency.
The Chairman. I appreciate that very much. Having been here
in two different tours, it has always amazed me that one of the
most important committees in the entire Congress has one of the
smallest hearing rooms.
Ms. Slaughter. Isn't that amazing? Completely airless, too.
The Chairman. And airless.
Ms. Slaughter. No circulation of any sort.
The Chairman. I happen to have been here long enough ago to
actually have been on the floor the first day that C-SPAN
started filming, and I remember the remarkable change it made,
I happen to think for the better, that people around the
country were able to, at the moment things were happening in
the House, to be able to observe it without having to come here
and sit in our galleries. I have always thought we ought to
extend that as much as possible. That is why I thank your
committee for making permanent that setting.
Mr. Dreier. Well, you are right, Mr. Chairman. Let me say
the Rules Committee up until this point was the only committee
in the Congress, save the Ethics Committee and Intelligence
Committee, for obvious reasons, that did not have full gavel-
to-gavel television coverage made available. So I am happy we
have been able to do that.
The Chairman. I am not trying to start a fight. I applaud
you for making progress.
Mr. Dreier. No, no, I just want to say that in support of
the ranking member.
The Chairman. Indeed. Thanks very much.
Mr. Brady.
Mr. Brady. No, just to thank the chairman and ranking
member for being here. I appreciate all the good work you do.
One real quick comment. I have meetings myself in a
different capacity, being the chairman of the party in the city
of Philadelphia, and I have them in the smallest, hottest room.
People don't want to stay there that long. Maybe it is a good
idea you are a small room.
Mr. Dreier. Just to expand on that, I will tell you when I
went on to the Rules Committee in 1990, David Broder, the dean
of the press corps with the Washington Post, said to me that
the Rules Committee is small by design. He said it is to keep
us out.
So we are trying to bring about a change in that.
Ms. Slaughter. I would like to make one more point about
frugality, David. The chairs we sit in in the Rules Committee
were purchased in 1967. Chairs have changed a lot since then,
but we never thought we should spend the money to buy new ones.
We want to say we are doing our part up there to save money.
Mr. Dreier. I never gave that any thought.
The Chairman. Keep them a little longer. They will qualify
as antiques.
Ms. Slaughter. You do if your legs are shorter.
The Chairman. Mr. Harper.
Mr. Harper. I just want to thank both of you for doing a
thankless job, and appreciate the efforts to do more with less.
Thank you.
The Chairman. Ms. Lofgren.
Ms. Lofgren. Thank you to both of you for your service and
all of those long meetings. It is not something the rest of us
envy, but we do appreciate your service. It is terrific.
The Chairman. Mr. Nugent.
Ms. Slaughter. One of us.
Mr. Dreier. One of those long-suffering Rules Committee
members.
Mr. Nugent. I always love it. We talk about
nonpartisanship, and we have an issue rather quickly. But the
good part is that actually the budget for the Rules Committee
is less than the 110th Congress, and that is a phenomenal
position to be in. I am glad to see that you both can sit at
the same table. There are times, obviously, in the Rules
Committee that it gets a little contentious. I won't say it is
totally--it is partisan, but it is important work. I didn't
realize the chairs were as old, but after 12 hours, I will tell
you, I don't care what chair we had, it would be old.
But I appreciate both of your service on that committee,
and obviously having sat on it now just for a short period of
time, I truly do appreciate all that every person that serves
on that committee does.
Mr. Dreier. Thank you very much, Mr. Nugent, for your great
service on the committee as well.
The Chairman. I thank both of you. I appreciate your work,
and thank you for your submissions.
All right, the committee now welcomes Chairman Upton and
Ranking Member Waxman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
We received your submissions, written submissions, on the
oversight plan, the issues you are dealing with, your personnel
costs and other costs, and so forth, and we examined those. If
you have prepared statements, they will be made part of the
record. We look forward to hearing from both of you.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. FRED UPTON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN

Mr. Upton. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do have a
prepared statement. I am not going to read it. I am just going
to say that not only are we early----
The Chairman. We appreciate that.
Mr. Upton. We are better than on time, but we are also
complying with the 5 percent cut from the last Congress. It has
been tough, I will confess that. Not only did we expand our
number of subcommittees from five to six from the last couple
of years, it is also very difficult, as we find, to compete for
great staff. And I am so fortunate that we have done very well.
But when you look downtown and first-year law students can make
$150,000 without knowing anything, we are a little bit under
the gun in that respect. But Mr. Harper knows, because he has
firsthand knowledge of the key folks that we have, being a
member of our committee, we have done very well. But we have
complied with the budget request and appreciate your
leadership.
I yield to my friend and ranking member, Mr. Waxman.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. HENRY A. WAXMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

Mr. Waxman. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Brady, Members, I am pleased
to be here today to express to you that Chairman Upton and his
staff have worked with us in a collegial manner in preparing
this budget. I support this proposal and believe it is fair
toward the committee minority.
As you know, our committee has broad jurisdiction. We have
a lot to do. I want to be sure that we get the implementation
of the comprehensive health reform law. The Republicans want to
take the time to repeal that law. We need good staff on both
sides on that issue. We also need to deal with other
responsibilities on other matters.
I would urge you to consider increasing the committee's
funding by reallocating some of the funds that went to the
Select Committee on Global Warming to our committee. The Energy
and Commerce Committee has primary responsibility in the House
for examining the public health and energy security issues
posed by global warming and greenhouse gas emissions. The
chairman and I may have different perspectives on these issues,
but we fully agree that the committee should be spearheading a
close review of this subject. Some additional resources from
the funds from the select committee would not increase the
overall amount of committee funding, but it would help us do
our job for the American people.
So I support the efforts of the chair and urge you to
support our budget.

The Chairman. Mr. Chairman, can you tell us, do you share
jurisdictional responsibility over EPA with the Science
Committee, or is that not in your bailiwick?
Mr. Upton. We would like to think not. Actually though, to
be completely serious, John Shimkus chairs the Environment and
Economy Subcommittee, and what we did on our side, and I am the
former ranking member of the Energy and Environment
Subcommittee, and we split the jurisdiction of that former
subcommittee into two subcommittees. Ed Whitfield now runs the
Energy and Power Subcommittee, the name it was back in the
1970s, 1980s and some of the 1990s, and John Shimkus runs the
Environment and Economy separately.
Mr. Waxman. But the chair is asking a different question
between our committee and another committee, Natural Resources.
Mr. Upton. No, he said Science.
The Chairman. Look, I know it is controversial on both
sides on EPA. I just want to know whether we have got
committees that are going to do the oversight of EPA so we can
answer some of the questions that are being asked of us by our
constituents.
Mr. Waxman. We have the primary responsibility for the
regulatory parts of EPA when it comes to clean air, and if we
were doing something on greenhouse gas emissions, it would
legislatively come out of our committee. Other committees share
part of the jurisdiction, Natural Resources, Science Committee.
The Chairman. My question is, in terms of oversight, is
your committee prepared to do the oversight on EPA so that at
least--and I know it is contentious, but my point is, I would
like to be able to answer my constituents who ask me questions
about EPA, what are you guys doing, what are they doing. I
would like to know as part of your oversight responsibilities,
do you take that as a charge, and with the 5 percent cut, are
you going to be able to do that so we can have the kind of data
presented to us as a result of oversight by your committee and
other committees that we can make some intelligent decisions?
Mr. Upton. The quick answer is yes. In fact, we have Lisa
Jackson coming. The Administrator of the EPA is coming again to
testify this Friday, I believe. Next Friday.
The Chairman. Then the other question I would have is I
have looked back at committees and what they have not spent in
the past. Your committee in the past has pretty much had to
expend all of your resources. So when you take a 5 percent hit,
that might be more difficult than some other committees.
How were you able to achieve your 5 percent--I am not
suggesting we have any more money, but I would just like to
know, where did you go to achieve your 5 percent cut?
Mr. Upton. Well, since I did not have a role in last year's
budget, as being only a ranking member on a subcommittee, we
have made it work. We took the traditional balance between
staff, between majority and minority, something that has been
around for a long, long time, but we were able to come up with
a 5 percent cut.
We have added some technology to our committee from before.
There are some things that still don't work. We had microphones
not work yesterday in one of our hearing rooms. We have been
able to tighten our belt and make it work.
The Chairman. Mr. Waxman.
Mr. Waxman. Yes. If we this trend of cutting the committee
budget continues, I think we would face significant staffing
gaps. We need to oversee health care reform, and move forward
on energy independence, food safety, safe drinking water and
other important initiatives under our jurisdiction that are
critical to the health and welfare of our citizens and national
economy. If anything, we need more money to help ensure that we
can conduct thorough review of the laws under our jurisdiction
and ensure that programs are operating that minimize waste,
fraud and abuse.
So, I am not endorsing the 5 percent cut. I think we have a
lot to do, and that 5 percent cut would make it harder for us
to do our job.
The Chairman. As I understand it, Chairman Upton, you still
have 122 slots on your committee?
Mr. Upton. I believe that that is correct.
The Chairman. I understand the difficulty everybody has,
but by my count, that is the highest of any committee in the
House right now. I know we can all find ways to spend our money
effectively, I guess, is what some would say, but we are under
the crunch to work with this 5 percent cut, and I appreciate
the fact that you both have worked on that and that you have, I
guess, the one-third/two-third split, majority to minority.
Mr. Brady.
Mr. Brady. Just to thank the chairman and the ranking
member for being here, and thank you for your courtesy. There
are a few incidents where I had constituents from the city of
Philadelphia had to come in front of you. You were most
courteous and fair, and I appreciate that.
Thank you.
The Chairman. Mr. Harper.
Mr. Harper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is indeed an honor
to serve with you----
Mr. Upton. How did you get that waiver? That is what I want
to ask.
Mr. Harper. I don't know how that happened. But I do want
to say on the issue of the funding with the 5 percent cut, keep
in mind that from the 110th to 111th, that was a 12 percent
increase in funding, and even at the level we are now, you are
still almost $1.4 million over the 110th level. So money is
tight. We are all having to do more with less.
Is this something--if we get to the 113th Congress, and we
realize that we are still having to cut, do you foresee the
ability to trim back even more than the 5 percent we are doing
this year?
Mr. Upton. We will obey the rules of the House and what is
there. We have been able to accommodate the vote that we had
back in January on the second day that we were in session, and
I know, and you know, too, that we have a very talented staff.
When you look at the share of the budget that goes to the
staff, they help us do our work on both sides.
We have a very talented staff, and I know under the budget
constraints, we will probably have some difficulty in keeping
them all. I never want them to go away. They are great people.
But at some point they are likely to depart because of higher
salaries, and that is the dilemma that we will be in. We look
at so many issues before our committee, knowing we have
jurisdiction over certainly now the energy costs that are
there, but the health care costs, telecommunications, commerce,
manufacturing and trade, the oversight responsibility that we
have. It is tough to lure folks sometimes as we did from the
private sector coming to work for the committee, and we are
very glad of the leadership that I have on our top committee
staffs that we are able to do that.
Mr. Harper. Can you meet your oversight responsibilities
with the current budget?
Mr. Upton. I believe we can. I am confident with this
budget we can do our job.
The Chairman. Ms. Lofgren.
Ms. Lofgren. No questions.
The Chairman. Mr. Schock.
Mr. Schock. No questions.
The Chairman. Mr. Nugent.
Mr. Nugent. No questions.
The Chairman. That is it.
Mr. Upton. On time and under budget.
The Chairman. On time and under budget, and out of here
early. Thank you.
All right. Thank you for being here early. We are actually
moving through rather well, and we appreciate you working with
us on that.
The committee now welcomes Chairman Hastings and Ranking
Member Markey of the Committee on Natural Resources. We have
the voluminous information that you have supplied us with in
terms of your oversight plan, your answers to funding
questions, personnel and other things. If you have a prepared
statement, we would make that part of the record, but we are
anxiously awaiting your oral testimony.
I am not going to say what the ranking member just said a
moment ago. Would you like to say that?
No. Okay. All right.
Doc Hastings, thanks very much.
Mr. Brady. Only that I know I won't rob a bank. But you
know more.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. DOC HASTINGS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

Mr. Hastings. When I hear you say you are anxiously
awaiting my statement, I reflect on what my dad used to say:
Are you sure you are lying?
Since my full statement will appear in the record, I will
just simply say the budget request we submitted to you reflects
the 5 percent reduction. We can certainly live with that.
From a staff standpoint, we are mirroring essentially what
we did last year when Chairman Rahall and I were here, as far
as the allocation of staff. We have, I think, six staff that
are nonpartisan that do all the administrative work, and we
divide the rest by two-thirds to one-third. That has worked
very well on the Resources Committee in the past, and we mirror
that again.
The one area that the budget does reflect is a slight
decrease in travel. I am not going to say that is problematic,
but I think with the idea that we need more oversight, the
Congress needs more oversight in a variety of areas, I am not
going to say it is going to be problematic, because we
certainly are going to live with that.
Finally, I will simply say while I know my distinguished
ranking member and I will probably have violent disagreements
on policy, we agree that this is the proper way to fund our
committee, and we look forward to working together at least in
that respect.
But now, unless Ed wants to say he is going to agree with
me and have an epiphany because I am the chairman, I fully
accept that, too. But in case that doesn't, we will work
certainly in a bipartisan way as far as administration of our
committee is concerned.
With that, I will yield back my time.
[The statement of Mr. Hastings follows:]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6808A.029

The Chairman. Mr. Markey.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. EDWARD J. MARKEY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS

Mr. Markey. Thank you so much. I agree with Mr. Brady that
the longer you are in politics, the more you should aspire to a
higher percentage of your thoughts going unspoken. It is a good
philosophy that he is the epitome of, I should say, in terms of
his success in politics.
This is my 35th year on the Natural Resources Committee. It
is my first as the ranking member. This committee was
established right after the Louisiana Purchase in order to
manage those issues here in the United States Congress, and I
think that what Doc just laid out is an accurate reflection of
the relationship which the majority and the minority have.
We are very happy with the allocation. We think it is a
fair division of assets within the committee, and we do share
the administrative costs, which I think makes a lot of sense,
because much of what we do is just to ensure that there is a
proper operation of the committee. And I think that division of
assets works out very, very well, and it is done honestly and
in a completely nonpartisan basis, which I think really does
help the overall atmosphere of the committee.
There is some travel which is necessary for us to do the
kind of oversight that Doc has laid out as part of the agenda
of the committee, but I would say that notwithstanding the
partisan differences that are going to exist on particular
issues, in general we have an excellent working relationship,
and I would recommend the adoption of the budget as the
chairman has recommended it.
The Chairman. Thank you.
[The statement of Mr. Markey follows:]

The Chairman. Doc, you mentioned--Mr. Chairman, you
mentioned that you were in your budget looking at fewer travel
funds. Is that where you looked to take most of your 5 percent
cut, or did you have to do it across personnel as well?
Mr. Hastings. No, it was across the board. But the travel
one, I won't by any stretch of the imagination say it is a huge
cut. It is slightly less. But, no, it was generally across the
board is where we looked at it. It wasn't any one particular
area. It just turned out when we allocated it, that the travel
came in less. That is all.
The Chairman. In your committee jurisdiction, how much
jurisdiction do you have over water resources?
Mr. Hastings. Well, however it relates to public lands, we
have a great deal. I know in your State it has a huge impact,
as it does in my State as far as allocating water resources.
But generally there are other issues that play into that mix,
other statutes on the Federal books that play into that. But it
does affect water issues, no question.
The Chairman. That is one of my questions. It is important
for us in California and the West. We have a huge number of
issues in terms of water allocation. We also have the issue
that probably is within another committee of when we have made
a decision that we don't do earmarks, the question is how do
water projects get done, and what happens there, because that
is a question I am getting from my constituents, and it is a
question without an answer right now. I hope that in
diminishing travel expenses, you being a man of the West, you
will not forget the importance of the West as you look at
issues particularly affecting water in our region.
Mr. Hastings. Well, obviously the challenge is to
prioritize that travel, and I can tell you that we have
prioritized the travel to go to California to speak to the very
issue you are talking about. The time and all hasn't been set,
but that is certainly something we are going to do, because
this is a very serious issue, as you well know, to your economy
and to certain segments of your economy, especially agriculture
in the San Joaquin Valley.
The Chairman. Well, we also have the issue right now of
contracts that existed for decades with the Bureau of
Reclamation having a new determination. I have communities in
my district that have used the existing reliance on what the
law was to figure out how best to utilize those resources in an
environmentally protective fashion, and now they are being told
that what they relied on no longer exists.
Mr. Hastings. I will tell you as we are speaking right now,
the Water Subcommittee, chaired by your colleague from
California, Tom McClintock, they are having a budget hearing
right now, and these issues are being asked and being probed by
Mr. McClintock, as they should be. So out of that will come
some policy, I am sure, that will be developed in that regard.
The Chairman. I always remember Mark Twain's statement:
Whiskey is for drinking; water is for fighting.
Mr. Hastings. Right. And that there is also another truism
that is emerging, and that is we shouldn't ration shortages. We
should try to find abundance. And it seems to me, some of the
policies in the past have been exactly that, rationing
shortages.
The Chairman. Okay. And I realize this is--talking about
your budget, I just wanted to make sure that part of the
jurisdiction you have isn't going to be slighted, because it
really goes down to the question of how the people live in my
area and whether they are able to have a standard of living.
Mr. Hastings. Like I say, it is prioritizing our travel
budget, and that is high on our priority list.
The Chairman. Thank you very much.
Mr. Brady.
Mr. Brady. Just to thank the chairman and ranking member
for being here today, and keep up the good work. I know you
have a little bit of constraint with your budget problems, but
we know you can fulfill them. Thank you.
The Chairman. Mr. Harper.
Mr. Harper. Thank you for what you are doing and for your
service on the committee and leadership. I appreciate you
trying to do more with less. We will continue to work together.
Thank you.
The Chairman. Ms. Lofgren.
Ms. Lofgren. Just thanks to both Members. You will have
disagreements on policy, but it is nice to see it is not a
personal disagreement or a disagreement about how the committee
will function itself. So thank you both for that.
The Chairman. Mr. Schock.
Mr. Schock. No questions.
The Chairman. Mr. Nugent.
Mr. Nugent. Do you have any oversight as it relates to
water quality, numeric nutrients, EPA?
Mr. Hastings. Well, most of that jurisdiction as far as
oversight on those issues resides with the Energy and Commerce
Committee. Now, it intersects with us as it relates to public
lands. Where these issues intersect with some issues on public
lands, then we have a say. But primarily it is within the
Energy and Commerce Committee.
Mr. Markey. If I could, where, for example, there is
fracking going on on public lands, and there are water quality
issues, of course, that would come under the jurisdiction of
this committee. I think that is where it could begin to affect
rivers or drinking water that is coming off of public lands
because of the drilling, the fracking that is occurring on
public lands. We would have jurisdiction.
Mr. Nugent. In Florida, obviously, there is a large amount
of public lands that currently have wetlands on them, but also
flowing waters. Thank you.
The Chairman. I want to thank both of you. You used the
term ``violent disagreements.'' I would just suggest to you,
having played basketball with Mr. Markey, well, in the days
when he had two good Achilles tendons, watch out for the
elbows.
Mr. Hastings. Well, in the time we have been together, he
hasn't thrown an elbow yet. But thanks for the heads-up.
The Chairman. It usually happens in the second half.
Mr. Markey. This is reflecting ancient animosity which all
Notre Dame people have towards Boston College.
The Chairman. No, no, no. I have great respect for people
that went to BC. We used to refer to it as ``backup college.''
Mr. Markey. No longer.
The Chairman. I don't want to show any disrespect to Mr.
Van Hollen.
Mr. Ryan. His staff director is right here, and he is good
to go, and we agree.
The Chairman. Thank you for showing up.
We received the submissions that you have in writing about
your budget, about salaries, et cetera, and that is part of our
record. Any written statements that you have will be made part
of the record. We are pleased to hear from you.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. PAUL D. RYAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN

Mr. Ryan. This committee has a long tradition of the
majority treating the minority fairly. That was the case when
John Spratt was chairman. We are continuing that tradition,
one-third/two-thirds, sharing the equipment budget, doing it
honestly. Mr. Van Hollen's statement will concur.
I thank you for this opportunity. I ask unanimous consent
that my full statement be included in the record.
The Chairman. Without objection, it will be.

The Chairman. The 5 percent cut----
Mr. Ryan. We are fine with it.
The Chairman. Do you have any difficulty with respect to
the ability that you----
Mr. Ryan. No. We have our budget. We can live within the 5
percent cut. I can speak on behalf of both of us that we can do
that. We have been doing that anyway, so we are good to go.
The Chairman. I notice you are one of the committees over
the last number of years that have had the smallest increase,
both the smallest request and the smallest increase.
Mr. Ryan. We try to walk the talk.
The Chairman. Do you have the same number of members on the
Budget Committee this year as was true in the previous
Congress?
Mr. Ryan. Yes. I don't think the ratio has changed. We are
a little bit smaller. The ratio is about the same, but we are a
little bit smaller.
The Chairman. Okay. And staff, you have 66 staff members
total?
Mr. Ryan. That sounds about right.
The Chairman. Okay. I don't want to show any disrespect to
Mr. Van Hollen, but I also don't want to----
Mr. Brady. We have a statement from Mr. Van Hollen that
supports what Chairman Ryan is saying.
The Chairman. Mr. Brady.
Mr. Brady. Thank you for being here. I appreciate you doing
the job that you got to do. I know it was not easy. I know you
don't enjoy it. But thank you.
Mr. Ryan. Thank you.
The Chairman. Mr. Gingrey.
Mr. Gingrey. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
Chairman Ryan, in regard to the 5 percent, which you said
you are fine with, and being the Budget Committee, I know that
you know how to work that out, did it result in any lesser
number of personnel, full-time equivalents?
Mr. Ryan. No. We have been living with this savings all
along. As you know, when you go from minority to majority,
obviously the majority going into a minority shrinks their
staff, and the minority going into the majority increases its
staff. So putting those changes and dislocations aside, this
doesn't hamper our ability because we have been frugal all
along.
Mr. Gingrey. In regard to deeper cuts, and, of course,
obviously some amendments were proffered in regard to even
additional 5 percent across-the-board cuts, was that something
that would have caused a great deal of heartburn to try to
enact after taking a 5 percent cut?
Mr. Ryan. It simply depends upon the depth. Obviously,
there comes a point where then you do start doing layoffs. We
have lots of printing we do in the Budget Committee. We don't
do lots of travel, but there are some. We plan on doing some
field hearings in the States to get ideas from around the
country. Obviously, personnel is the biggest line item in our
budget. It depends on how deep it gets.
I would simply say we do a lot with very few people. We are
in charge, both the minority and the majority, of crafting the
budget for the Federal Government not only for this year, but
for the next 10 years. That is a big task. It requires a lot of
expertise. And it is important that we do this here because we
are the legislative branch. We don't want to simply rely on the
executive branch to have the pen, to have the spreadsheets, to
call all the shots. We need to have independent expertise here
in Congress so we can exercise our constitutional rights under
the separation of powers of having the power of the purse.
So with 66 people between the majority and the minority,
that compares to thousands of people at OMB, 400 to 500 at CBO.
So we do a lot compared to everybody else with very few people.
Mr. Gingrey. Indeed you do, Mr. Chairman. I commend you and
the ranking member for the work you do with very limited
resources.
Mr. Ryan. OMB is not quite 1,000. It is under 1,000. I am
sorry. I stand corrected.
Mr. Gingrey. But the importance of what you do cannot be
overstated, and we on the committee deeply appreciate the work
you do.
Mr. Chairman, I will yield back. No further questions.
The Chairman. For the record, can you talk at least a
little bit about how your committee works with CBO? CBO is a
creation of the Congress. As you say, they have 400 folks there
dealing with issues.
Mr. Ryan. They have 200 to 300 people.
The Chairman. Okay, 200 to 300 people, but obviously far
more than you do with 66. How and in what way do you rely on
them in your preparation of the budget?
Mr. Ryan. We rely on CBO to provide us all of the savings
estimates, all of the cost estimates of any particular policy.
As you know, tax policy is under the purview of the Joint
Committee on Taxation, which is under the purview of the Ways
and Means Committee. We get our revenue lines from CBO. But all
spending estimates on savings or costing come from CBO.
So our analysts, the 66 people here between the minority
and the majority, are in constant communication on a daily
basis with their counterparts in CBO to get the savings
estimates on any particular policy change we are considering
that we are planning on.
So all of our budgeting is done based upon their estimates,
based upon their numbers, based upon their baseline. So they
prepare what I would call the measuring stick, the baseline,
and then we think of reforms to get savings, or to spend more
money, it depends on whatever budget you are writing, and we
rely on their estimates as to the cost estimates of those
policies to put our budgets together. So we completely rely on
CBO.
The Chairman. Thank you very much.
Mr. Van Hollen, thank you for coming. We realize that we
were a little ahead of schedule, and you are not late actually,
in accordance with the time. In fact, you are actually a little
early. Not as early as Mr. Ryan.
Mr. Ryan has assured us that you agree with everything he
presented. No, what he said was you agree with the budget
submission. But we would love to have you speak for yourself.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MARYLAND

Mr. Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Brady, members
of the committee, Mr. Gingrey. I learned in the last 5 minutes
I really have to get in better shape running over here. But I
am going to be very brief.
As you know, on the Budget Committee, while we may have
contentious debates on policy issues and look forward to trying
to find areas where we can agree from time to time on policy
issues, we fully support the chairman's request for the budget.
The Budget Committee, this committee, as I am sure you
know, has a long tradition of bipartisan cooperation when it
comes to the fair distribution of the committee's resources,
and I am pleased to report that from our vantage point, that
cooperation is very much there under the leadership of Chairman
Paul Ryan. I want to thank him for his cooperation and
graciousness in leading the committee and in the fair
distribution of the resources.
Mr. Ryan. John Spratt was that way with us, Jim Nussle was
that way with them, and we are just continuing the tradition.
Mr. Van Hollen. We did have to make some tough decisions, I
would say, but it was as a result of the transition in the
Congress, not as a result of different distribution in the
budget. But anything you can do to support the budget as
requested, we have already, especially, of course, on the
minority side, had to make some painful adjustments.
[The statement of Mr. Van Hollen follows:]

The Chairman. Having served on the Budget Committee,
knowing the work you do and the excellent staff that has been
there, both Democrat and Republican, I appreciate your budget
request. I also appreciate the fact that your committee has the
history of probably being the most frugal in terms of requests
for----
Mr. Ryan. As I say, we like to walk the talk.
The Chairman. That has been true under both Democrat and
Republican. I appreciate the fact you are continuing that.
Do any Members have questions of Mr. Van Hollen?
Well, we thank you. If you want to figure out how to get in
shape, just follow Paul Ryan's prescription.
Mr. Ryan. 6:30 every morning in the gym.
The Chairman. This hearing is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:22 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]
