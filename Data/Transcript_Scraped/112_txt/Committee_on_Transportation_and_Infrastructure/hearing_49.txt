REVIEW AND STATUS OF THE MULTIBILLION-
DOLLAR DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY RELOCATION PROJECT IN
WASHINGTON, DC, AND ITS IMPACTS ON
THE U.S. COAST GUARD

----------

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2011

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:00 a.m., in
room 2167, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Frank LoBiondo
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. LoBiondo. Good morning. The subcommittee will come to
order.
The subcommittee is meeting today to review the current
plan to move the Coast Guard headquarters to the west campus of
St. Elizabeths hospital in Anacostia. The subcommittee has long
had concerns with the plan to move the Coast Guard headquarters
to St. Elizabeths. Specifically, the subcommittee has been
concerned with the adequacy of access to the facility.
Isolation of the Coast Guard, if no other entities move to the
campus, would be a big question mark.
Any additional cost that would be borne by the Coast Guard
to move to the new facility and to support its operations would
also be another huge concern and the impact of those costs will
have on the ability of the Service to conduct their critical
missions.
In 2006, the authorization bill for the Coast Guard
prohibited the Service from moving until the General Services
Administration provided a plan that identified another DHS
agency that would be moving to St. Elizabeths around the same
time as the Coast Guard, what improvements would be made to
access the facility, and how the move would affect the
Service's operations. The GSA provided that plan, but now, due
to funding constraints, it will not be followed.
House appropriators have not provided funding in fiscal
year 2012 to complete the new Coast Guard headquarters, and
Senate appropriators have provided what may be just barely
enough to enable the Coast Guard to move but no funding for
construction for any other DHS component, and this is a matter
of huge concern.
And now the Secretary is saying that she would rather spend
her limited funding on front-line operations than on St.
Elizabeths's project. While I wholeheartedly agree with her
Coast Guard front-line operations are critically important,
however, we are concerned that that position leaves the Coast
Guard further in limbo.
At our July 2011 hearing, the subcommittee was informed
that it could cost the Service over $54 million in fiscal year
2013 to move its headquarters and that it could cost over $20
million annually in additional rent in each of the following
years. In the current fiscal environment, those are significant
numbers; and they could have significant impacts on the
Service's front-line operations, which is something none of us
want to see.
We all know the Coast Guard is hard pressed to meet its
current mission goals. The Service has testified before this
committee that it lacked the manpower and assets to effectively
respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill or to conduct safety
inspections of commercial vessels or to continue to conduct
port security operations at the current tempos or to upgrade
housing for its servicemembers. The list just goes on and on.
Before the Service is forced to spend tens of millions of
additional operating dollars on rent, perhaps we could focus on
addressing these priorities first.
In addition to the cost of resource issues, there are
several logistical issues that I think further complicate this
move. There is currently insufficient road access to St.
Elizabeths. The Department's consolidation plans call for
construction of a new off ramp from I-295 because the current
access to St. Elizabeths is inconvenient and, maybe more
importantly, inadequate. Unfortunately, the construction of
this off ramp is not planned until several years after the
Coast Guard relocates to St. Elizabeths. And that is when it is
planned for. So when it will actually happen remains a big
question mark.
In addition, there are several hundred less parking spaces
available to Coast Guard personnel at St. Elizabeths than there
are at the current headquarters location. This will force a
large number of personnel to rely on public transportation and
a contracted shuttle bus, which may or may not be able to meet
the demand. So I am very concerned about the message that we
are giving to the personnel who have to move out there as well.
So I hope our witnesses will be able to address these
logistical issues.
The subcommittee does not oppose moving the Coast Guard
headquarters to St. Elizabeths. We understand the value in
consolidating DHS headquarters in one location. However, the
subcommittee was promised by the previous administration that
moving the Coast Guard would not unduly burden the Service
financially, undermine its mission readiness, or leave it
isolated at St. Elizabeths. Unfortunately, it appears as though
our worst fears are coming true.
Before this plan can move forward, the Department and the
Service need to work out an arrangement that does not disrupt
front-line operations or leave the Service out there on its
own. Otherwise, we will be forced to take action to keep
taxpayer dollars from being needlessly wasted and to ensure
that the Coast Guard stands ready to do its job and protect the
American people.
I would like to thank our witnesses for appearing here
today. We look forward to their testimony.
And now I would like to yield to Mr. Larsen.
Mr. Larsen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for convening this
morning's oversight hearing to review the status of the
Department of Homeland Security's consolidation project in
Washington, DC. Our focus is on the relocation of the U.S.
Coast Guard to a new headquarters facility that is currently
under construction at this particular site.
The Coast Guard, among its diverse missions, functions as
the lead Federal maritime law enforcement agency responsible
for domestic maritime security. As such, the Service is engaged
in several activities vital to homeland security, including
port, waterway, and coastal security operations, vessel and
cargo inspection, and illegal migrant and drug interdiction.
Through these activities and more, the Service ensures our
coastal resources infrastructure are protected, that our ocean,
Great Lakes, and inland waterway commerce remains safe and
stable, and that our maritime industries continue to provide
jobs and economic opportunity.
With the passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the
Coast Guard was transferred from the Department of
Transportation and become part of the new Department of
Homeland Security. Notwithstanding the normal growing pains
that are to be expected with any significant Government
reorganization, that movement has provided more or less mutual
benefits to the Coast Guard and DHS.
The Congress and the Bush administration in 2007 begin the
joint process of designing and building a consolidated DHS
headquarters facility to better leverage the capabilities of
this newly created Department and to promote mission
integration and reduce duplication. These objectives remain as
relevant today as they were in 2007.
Located at the 338 acre St. Elizabeths campus across the
Anacostia River from the Capitol in Southeast Washington, when
construction concludes in 2016 the new DHS's campus will
provide 4\1/2\ million square feet of office space for
approximately 14,000 employees and servicemembers.
I might also add this project, which is providing hundreds
of high-paying jobs, has been delivered on time, within
budget--no small accomplishment. While there are some critics
expressing concern about the cost associated with the Coast
Guard's relocation to this new facility, something that the
Service fully supports and which the GSA insists remain on
schedule, the reality is that these costs have always been
known and accounted for.
Moreover, DHS, GSA, and the Coast Guard are presently
developing an equitable cost-sharing strategy to ensure the
Coast Guard's operational capabilities are not diminished. On
this point, I agree entirely with Chairman LoBiondo. The Coast
Guard should not have to pay more than its fair share when it
relocates to its new facility at St. Elizabeths, and I urge the
agencies to finalize a cost-sharing arrangement as soon as
possible to ease any of our concerns.
Another issue looming is that we may lose many of the cost
savings and other benefits that have been realized thus far
unless Congress itself renews its commitment to fund
construction of St. Elizabeths. Homeland Security is simply too
important for the Congress to allow this project to drift off
course to an uncertain future.
No one has questioned the need to complete the
consolidation. For that matter, no one has seriously proposed
its termination. Yet, remarkably, the House appropriations
bills do not fund this project, even though the end result will
mean significantly higher costs, scheduled delays, higher
unemployment, and, worst of all, a DHS that is less efficient,
less coordinated, and less effective that it could be if this
project was successfully completed.
I hope everyone wants to maximize the value of our $1.4
billion investment. It will require a small additional
investment to achieve it. Unfortunately, that investment to
date will be nearly worthless unless we finish it.
Again, I share the chairman's concern for potential impacts
to the Coast Guard's operations budget as a result of the
Service's relocation to St. Elizabeths. But we should not lose
focus on the fact that it is Congress that controls whether or
not this consolidation project is completed on schedule and
within budget. So to the extent that we can work together to
keep this larger project on track for timely completion we will
also attain our mutual goal of insuring a more effective U.S.
Coast Guard.
Mr. Chairman, that completes my opening statement.
I also have a unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous
consent that pursuant to Rule 3(e) of the committee rules that
Congresswoman Norton be allowed to participate in today's
hearing.
Mr. LoBiondo. Without objection, so ordered.
Welcome, Ms. Norton. Thanks you for joining us.
Our panel of witnesses include Coast Guard Vice Admiral
John Currier, the Deputy Commandant for Mission Support; Mr.
Donald Bathurst, DHS Chief Administrative Officer, and the
Honorable Robert Peck, Commissioner of Public Buildings for the
GSA.
I welcome you and thank you for being here today and for
participating.
Admiral Currier, you are recognized.

TESTIMONY OF VICE ADMIRAL JOHN P. CURRIER, DEPUTY COMMANDANT
FOR MISSION SUPPORT, UNITED STATES COAST GUARD; THE HONORABLE
DONALD G. BATHURST, CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER, DEPARTMENT OF
HOMELAND SECURITY; AND THE HONORABLE ROBERT A. PECK,
COMMISSIONER, PUBLIC BUILDINGS SERVICE, GENERAL SERVICES
ADMINISTRATION

Admiral Currier. Thank you, Chairman LoBiondo. Good
morning, Ranking Member Larsen, distinguished members of the
subcommittee. I am honored to appear before you today with Mr.
Donald Bathurst and Mr. Robert Peck to speak about the Coast
Guard headquarters' move to St. Elizabeths.
The Coast Guard is committed to the vision of a unified
Department of Homeland Security headquarters campus, and we
look forward to being the first to relocate to St. Elizabeths.
GSA, DHS, and the Coast Guard team have been working since 2005
in preparation of the Coast Guard's move to St. Elizabeths, and
we look forward with anticipation to completion of phase 1
construction in 2013.
For the Coast Guard, St. Elizabeths represents improved
working conditions for our people, as well as occupy a brand
new class A office space. The facilities include not just Coast
Guard headquarters building but also space required for
personnel support. Those activities include a medical, dental
clinic, child development center, cafeteria, fitness center,
parking, and a Coast Guard Exchange. GSA is committed to
completing all of these facilities prior to our move, which is
scheduled to begin in April of 2013.
I have walked this site several times, sir, and I am most
impressed with both the setting, the quality, the layout. It is
really coming together as a fantastic new location for Coast
Guard headquarters.
However, the GSA/DHS Coast Guard plan is dependent on
funding. The 2012 President's budget included funding for both
DHS and GSA, and if not supported that would leave the project
without adequate resources to facilitate the move or for the
construction of key access roads. Without this funding, the
Coast Guard's move to St. Elizabeths will be impacted.
Additionally, when I testified before you this summer, I
spoke regarding my concern regarding operating costs of the new
facility and our ability to fund the lease. I report to you
today that DHS has assured the Coast Guard that they will
provide the requisite resources to support the move and any
additional recurring cost incurred with the relocation. The
Secretary told the commandant that she is committed to ensuring
the move to St. Elizabeths does not impact front-line Coast
Guard operations.
In addition, GSA has made a commitment to waive double
occupancy rent costs for the facilities at Buzzards Point and
St. Elizabeths to reduce our move-in costs in fiscal year 2013.
We understand that we are moving out of a campus that will
still be under construction, and that will create unique
challenges for our workforce. Given the imminent move over the
past year, my staff has developed a communications plan to
inform our people regarding the move, identify questions and
concerns from our workforce.
In addition to publishing information on all-hands
announcement on our Web site, I recently personally hosted town
hall events with the headquarters' workforce. Questions ranged
from parking to shuttles to status of construction; and with
the cooperation of DHS and GSA, I was able to reassure our
workforce that their concerns are in fact being addressed. I
intend to continue to work with DHS, the project staff, and GSA
to assure that, despite ongoing construction, a safe, secure,
and functional environment is provided for all of our
employees.
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I will
be happy to answer any of your questions.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you, Admiral.
Mr. Bathurst, you are recognized.
Mr. Bathurst. Chairman LoBiondo, Ranking Member Larsen,
members of the committee, good morning. Thank you for the
opportunity to appear before you in support of our efforts to
consolidate the Department's headquarters.
I am Don Bathurst, the Chief Administrative Officer for the
Department of Homeland Security; and I am pleased to be here
today to update you on the program toward establishing the DHS
consolidated headquarters at St. Elizabeths, with particular
interest on the Coast Guard's move.
The Secretary's first priority is to support our front-line
missions, and in this challenging fiscal environment difficult
decisions have to be made. The Secretary and the administration
remain committed to consolidating the Department's
headquarters, as evidenced by the President's fiscal 2011 and
2012 budget request, and will continue to work with Congress to
move this project forward while maintaining front-line
operations again during these challenging fiscal times.
With bipartisan support, the phase 1 construction of the
DHS consolidated headquarters, the Coast Guard building,
started in fiscal year 2009 with appropriations to both DHS and
GSA. The Recovery Act provided the project with sufficient
funds to meet our planned fiscal 2010 requirements for the
project. This project was on schedule and on budget with the
submission of the fiscal year 2011 budget. DHS and GSA were
poised to start the critical next segments of the
headquarters--the departmental headquarters segment and the
construction of the DHS operations center.
Bringing the component operation centers together into the
DHS operations center will resolve deficiencies in operational
management, which was noted in various lessons learned reports
and Government Accountability Office reports after Hurricane
Katrina.
In fiscal year 2011, DHS received $77.4 million of our
$287.8 million request; and GSA received $82 million for their
entire nationwide new construction program, of which $30
million was allocated to the St. Elizabeths project. This
reduction has disrupted the integrated sequencing of the
project, delayed the schedule, caused a loss of planned
construction efficiencies, and, as a result, will increase the
cost of the project.
The fiscal year 2012 request is critical to both DHS and
GSA for on-schedule completion and occupancy of the Coast
Guard. Of the combined $378 million requested between DHS and
GSA, we need $132 million for Coast Guard to occupy phase 1 as
planned. DHS would need $56 million for IT equipment,
commissioning, outfitting, and the move costs. GSA needs $76
million for transportation and utility infrastructure. The
funding requirements are co-dependent. Without both, the new
1.1 million square foot Coast Guard building will not be fully
ready for occupancy.
Completion of phase 1 of the St. Elizabeths campus is the
first priority for this project, followed immediately by the
construction of the DHS operations centers. We are committed to
do this and to ensure the support of the front-line missions.
This will allow the Department to maximize the taxpayer
investment and resolve major lessons learned from Hurricane
Katrina and other operational experience. We urge your
continued support for this critical investment that provides
better operational efficiencies and saves money in the long
run.
Again, I thank you for the opportunity to testify this
morning; and I am pleased to answer any questions you may have.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you.
Mr. Peck, you are recognized.
Mr. Peck. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Larsen,
Ms. Norton, and other members of the subcommittee.
I have a written statement which we want to submit for the
record.
I appreciate the opportunity to join you today to discuss
our continued progress toward moving the Coast Guard
headquarters to the consolidated DHS headquarters at the St.
Elizabeths campus. And you can see on the screens in the room
construction progress. That photo was taken this month.
Congress, Coast Guard, DHS, and GSA developed and agreed
upon the consolidation strategy for DHS in 2006, the first
facility scheduled to come on line as a Coast Guard
headquarters building worthy of the Coast Guard's vital
missions, enhancing its ability to achieve those missions and
providing a building customized to meet its specific
requirements and security needs.
Throughout its brief history, DHS headquarters functions
have been scattered in more than 50 locations throughout the
national capital region. This fragmentation has resulted in
operational challenges for the agency. Many of these locations
are leased space, which is not cost effective in the long term
and cannot offer the same degree of security or efficiency as a
campus such as St. Elizabeths. Consolidation into one secure
campus will facilitate communication, coordination, and
cooperation across the agency and increase operational
efficiency, while also providing a more cost-effective and
secure workplace for the long term.
Construction of the $350 million, 1.2 million square foot
Coast Guard building built to the exact specifications of the
Coast Guard is on budget and on schedule for completion in
fiscal year 2013. It also represents a significant product
milestone in housing the first 3,600 employees of the total of
14,000 Homeland Security employees who eventually will be
housed on the campus.
In addition to completing the new Coast Guard headquarters
building, GSA is in the process of renovating several St.
Elizabeths campus buildings, constructing the security's
perimeter fence, gatehouses and utility tunnels. This
construction, coupled with the adaptive reuse of historic
buildings on the campus, will provide secure space and
sufficient amenities for the Coast Guard while other components
are constructed and development occurs in the surrounding
community.
GSA recognizes that while the House appropriation action
for fiscal year 2012 so far has eliminated our proposed $218
million in construction funding for St. Elizabeths, the Senate
mark includes $65 million. The Senate mark also includes $56
million in funding for DHS to complete their portion of the
project for the Coast Guard move in.
The consolidation of the DHS particularly at this time
presents a variety of opportunities to save taxpayers' money
and make good long-term housing decisions. The unfortunate
downturn in the construction market has given us an opportunity
to achieve more with current funding levels. This is the right
time to invest in the Nation's infrastructure. Funding delays
result in construction cost escalations and present real cost
increases to taxpayers.
Additionally, consolidation allows us to eliminate the
dozens of leases currently housing DHS. The Government
Accountability Office has long focused on the Federal
Government's overreliance on leasing as a high-risk concern. By
converting from lease to owned space, GSA will generate revenue
for reinvestment needed for our public buildings
infrastructure, rather than paying higher costs in private
buildings.
The Coast Guard headquarters alone will represent the
conversion of nearly 1 million square feet of space from leased
to Federal ownership. This conversion of lease to owned space
saves taxpayers money in the long term. Based on the net
present value analysis for the consolidated campus, taxpayers
will save approximately $500 million in net present value,
versus the cost of leasing the same amount of space over the
next 30 years.
GSA and DHS are proud to work together in delivering this
essential campus. While the timeline of the remainder of the
DHS headquarters consolidation project will have to shift due
to funding limitations, both DHS and GSA as well as this
administration remain committed to the success and completion
of this project in as short a time as possible and at the least
cost.
Thank you for inviting me to testify. I know I have not
answered all of your questions in my statement, and I look
forward to our conversation this morning. Thank you.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you.
Admiral Currier, the Coast Guard may be required to pay the
cost of moving personnel and equipment as well as the cost to
simultaneously lease space at its current headquarters location
and the new headquarters building at St. Elizabeths. At our
subcommittee hearing in July, you estimated that this could
cost the Service an additional $54 million over the current
fiscal year's expenditures. Is that number still accurate?
Admiral Currier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
During the July hearing when I testified to that figure,
that was our best estimate at the time. We have been engaged,
fully engaged in partnership with DHS and GSA. We worked to
achieve better fidelity in the figures. We have arrived in an
arrangement with GSA and DHS. Their double occupancy will not
be charged, which was a large portion of that $54 million. So I
am pleased to say that as we continue to work toward our move
that we have materially reduced that $54 million figure, and we
continue to work to reduce it even further.
Mr. LoBiondo. Well, that is good news, but we would sure
like to have a hard number or close to a hard number. And, of
course, timing is of importance here.
Admiral Currier. Yes, sir.
Mr. LoBiondo. The current headquarters lease costs about
$36 million annually. The subcommittee understands that the new
facility will cost the Service $53 million a year, about a 42-
percent increase in rent. Do you feel those numbers are
accurate?
Admiral Currier. Sir, they continue to be evolved. I
hesitate to give you a number at this point. And I am not
trying to be evasive, but we continue to work toward reducing
those numbers.
But the offset on this is there is an enhanced footprint
for us. We have got a larger child care facility. We have
better IT. We are going have a more secure campus that we are
not on and quite vulnerable today.
So I am not trying to be evasive, and I can provide a
figure for the record as we mature it. We are working closely
in partnership with the other agencies to reduce that to the
max extent.
I guess the overarching theme, sir, is that the Commandant
and the Secretary and everybody involved is committed to the
fact that whatever costs are incurred here will not affect
Coast Guard front-line operations.
Mr. Peck. Mr. Chairman, might I add?
The comparison of current lease costs to the lease costs
that GSA will charge to the Coast Guard and DHS at the site are
comprised--the gap is comprised of a couple factors.
One, the building that we are building for the Coast Guard
is custom designed for it. The building they lease is not. The
building that we are building is a first-class building
designed for the operations of the Coast Guard. The current
leased location is not.
One of the current lease locations is in the 100-year flood
plain. We are not sure we would be able to renew the lease at
that location. But, if we do, the building, in any event, both
for the flood plain issues and the fact that the building is
old and needs a lot of work, will require extensive renovation;
and that would increase the lease costs at the current lease
location, too.
So the gap that the current lease costs does not quite
reflect what we think the costs would be in the future, even
were we to lease.
And then, finally, as I noted in my testimony, leasing
space in the long run for the Government, as this committee has
always reminded us, is a bad fiscal deal for the taxpayers.
Mr. LoBiondo. Mr. Bathurst, Admiral Currier just made a
statement that Secretary Napolitano's commitment to move
forward is unwavering, and I would just like a clarification.
On September the 8th, the Secretary was reported in the
press to have stated that she would prefer to spend her limited
dollars on front-line operations, rather than the St.
Elizabeths project. She also indicated that she was reexamining
moving the Coast Guard headquarters out there. Was this press
account accurate?
Mr. Bathurst. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I don't believe the press account was completely accurate.
I think it was taken out of context.
As I said in my testimony, there were very, very difficult
decisions have to be made in these trying fiscal times. Front-
line mission has got to be supported. We have got to support
our men and women on the pointy end of the spear.
That said, the support activities, the buildings, and the
like are a large cost of any organization; and we have got to
be very prudent as how we move forward with those.
The Secretary was really discussing the environment that we
are in, in that our request in 2011 had been reduced
drastically in the 2011 continuing resolution; and at the time
she made that statement the House appropriations committee mark
for the project was zero. And, in that, that puts the project
at risk. And with those marks, the issue was we are not going
to take money out of the front-line mission to make up those
differences. We are going to go have to live within the means
that the project is appropriated, which will then impact the
cost and schedule long term on the project.
Mr. LoBiondo. We are trying to get some clarity, so I
don't--I really want to make sure you don't think I am trying
to nitpick at you here. But there is a lot of money at stake.
And I note in your testimony that it did not--unless I missed
it--include any assurances that the Department is doing
everything it can to ensure the move to St. Elizabeths will
have no adverse affect on the impact of Coast Guard front-line
operations. Was that maybe just an omission or----
Mr. Bathurst. I think, as Admiral Currier said, we are
working with the Coast Guard on their operational support
costs. It is our commitment that the Coast Guard and any other
occupants of the headquarters space, as we continue to build
out the campus and bring other components there, will only pay
their fair share. We are committed to that.
Issues of outfitting the space, the move costs for the
Coast Guard are all being borne by the project office. Those
are not costs that the Coast Guard has to come up with. They
only need to pay their occupancy costs once they are there.
Again, we are looking at what the current costs are, which
there are a lot of different elements to that, into a
consolidated operating support cost that will be at the
consolidated headquarters location. And as that analysis is
still, as Admiral Currier said, being refined, we believe that
the current costs and the future costs will be comparable.
Mr. LoBiondo. So are you prepared to give us that assurance
now?
Mr. Bathurst. Absolutely, sir.
Mr. LoBiondo. OK, without any hesitation.
I will be finished here in just a minute, Rick.
When do you expect an agreement on cost sharing between the
Coast Guard and DHS and GSA?
Mr. Bathurst. Well, the analysis is ongoing. Certainly we
will have, I believe, good numbers with the President's budget
request that will come up here in the next 5 months.
Mr. Larsen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, I want to yield my time to Ms. Norton.
Ms. Norton. I thank the gentleman for yielding me his time,
and I thank the chairman for allowing me to appear at this
subcommittee of which I am not a member, although I am a member
of the full committee.
Admiral Currier, do you have any reluctance about being the
first to move to this site? Do you believe that others have to
be on this site in order for the Coast Guard of the United
States to feel that it can move to the site?
Admiral Currier. No, ma'am. Thank you for that question. We
have no reluctance. We are quite enthusiastic. We see this move
as very beneficial to our operational efficiency, to our
habitability concerns for our people. We are not wavering at
all in our commitment to move. We are not concerned about being
first. We have been first in the planning since day one, and we
are very enthusiastic about making this move over to St.
Elizabeths.
Ms. Norton. Well, actually I am not surprised. You are the
United States Coast Guard. I couldn't believe that the United
States Coast Guard would be reluctant or wouldn't want to be
the first to move to a new site, not our United States Coast
Guard. And it seems to me quite appropriate that the Coast
Guard lead the way, as the Coast Guard so often has led the way
in our country.
I certainly thank you for all you did in Hurricane Katrina,
because you certainly saved the day there.
I note that the Coast Guard is leading by example. The
Commandant tells me that he has already moved his residents to
be closer to this new facility. Is that not the case?
Admiral Currier. Yes, ma'am. We were able to enter into an
agreement with the Air Force to actually move the top four
people in Coast Guard headquarters over to Bolling Air Force
Base, which is quite a cost avoidance for us. We were able to
save some money doing that. It clearly is probably a 5- to 10-
minute commute to the new facility. So it is a win, win for
everyone.
Ms. Norton. Admiral Currier, you are going to be--except
for the Secretary herself who will be located here, of the 22
agencies that are a part of Homeland Security Department, the
Coast Guard gets to be the lead agency located there and one of
the few agencies that can be located right there on the
headquarters site. You indicated in a publication called the
Federal Response to Katrina: Lessons Learned, that, first and
most important, the Federal Government response organizations
must be collocated and strengthened to manage catastrophes in a
new management operations center. Do you expect that the Coast
Guard headquarters--the location of the Coast Guard
headquarters as part of a national operations center will
improve the operations of the Coast Guard itself as an entity
and within the Department of Homeland Security?
Admiral Currier. Yes, ma'am. I think that is clearly the
case.
What we have seen over the past year even with our response
to the Haitian earthquake, response to the Deepwater Horizon
spill in the Gulf of Mexico is that increasingly these complex
responses involve whole of Government. For us to be able to, as
the Secretary has articulated, be in one location building a
DHS culture and actually being collocated as we coordinate the
response from DHS I think is a huge benefit and clearly is the
way forward for us.
Ms. Norton. Mr. Bathurst, I served on the special Homeland
Security Committee when it was a special committee. I was on
the committee when it became a permanent committee. The only
reason I am not on it now is because the number of committees
was reduced to two. The Department was under constant criticism
from the committee, and much of that criticism really had to do
with the failure of the Department to become a coherent,
integrated organization. Do you believe that the DHS complex,
beginning, of course, with the Coast Guard but involving the
Secretary and headquarters operations as well, will reduce that
criticism of the agency as essentially the same sprawling bunch
of 22 agencies it was before Congress made the fateful decision
to make one Department of these agencies?
Mr. Bathurst. Yes, the short answer. That is really the
focus of the project, is to bring the departmental headquarters
with all of the component headquarters together around a
consolidated operations center.
Again, Coast Guard is first to move over. They have had a
longstanding need for consolidation of their headquarters, and
the St. Elizabeths site was perfect for that with the
continuation of the build-out of the DHS consolidated
operations centers and the departmental headquarters. That is
why we had a very aggressive integrated construction schedule
and the fiscal year 2011 and 2012 requests were to start the
work on the operations center and the secretarial offices and
the departmental headquarters.
With the reductions in the funding for fiscal year 2011 in
the CR and with the uncertainty of fiscal year 2012, it is
impacting out ability to bring the Secretary's office and to
build out the consolidated operations center. But when we get
those done I think, as Admiral Currier said, it will have a
significant, positive impact on our operational capabilities
and coordination.
Ms. Norton. Well, I understand what you are saying, Mr.
Bathurst. This was a $3.4 billion building. I must say I give
great credit to GSA for keeping on time. I don't know how you
have been able to do it so far. We did get a big tranche of
money out in the beginning which has allowed you to move
forward.
But I think the Coast Guard has every reason to be
concerned. Of course, Coast Guard and, for that matter, none of
us on this podium controls what Congress in fact appropriates.
Is there enough money appropriated in the Senate appropriation
to complete this building and to move the DHS and the GSA part
of it, since both have been funded forward as anticipated?
Mr. Bathurst. The combined President's request was $377
million in fiscal year 2012. That included $159 million for DHS
and $218 million for GSA. Of that total, we need $132 million
to complete the Coast Guard's occupancy in accordance with the
schedule and all agreements for transportation. We currently
have a mark in the Senate for DHS at $56 million and a
subcommittee mark of $65 million for all of GSA's construction
programs. It is uncertain, but, right now, those marks don't
rise to the level that we had planned for.
You mention how we have been able to keep this project on
track; and GSA, I agree, has done a phenomenal job of
coordinating all the contracts and the trades. We will find a
way to keep this project moving forward. However, we will not
be able to keep to the schedule, and some impacts on
transportation can be expected. And as the committee has said,
there are much concerns about transportation. And this is a
very, very delicate and intricate dance that we are doing with
the neighborhood and the like.
We believe that with the President's request we can bring
this project forward, deliver the first phase, and meet the
transportation needs. If there is something less that that,
there is going to be impacts on the transportation side, but we
will do all we can to bring the project forward as close to the
schedule requirements as we can.
Ms. Norton. I am over time, so, Mr. Chairman, I would like
to go again if you are going to have a second round.
Mr. LoBiondo. Mr. Bathurst, is the decision to move the
Coast Guard headquarters to St. Elizabeths under review by the
Department?
Mr. Bathurst. No, sir. We are looking at the entire phasing
of the project for phase 2 and phase 3 because of the impacts
of the fiscal year 2011 mark and the uncertainty of 2012. We
are going back--the original strategy for the project was
really one that was a little bit different than most Federal
construction, where normally the idea is you get all the money
you need to deliver everything that you need all at one time.
Because of the complexity of this project, and we looked at it
and felt that, working with GSA, we developed a strategy for an
integrated construction schedule, not unlike you do in the
private sector, and you only draw the money that you need at
the time that you need it. What that has led us to, though,
here is where we have had a reduction in that funding stream.
It has impacted those original plans.
So we are going back to relook at the strategy to go back
to those deliverable segments into the future. And that is
going to impact future occupancies, but the idea is we want to
try to bring those on as quickly as fiscally allowable.
Mr. LoBiondo. Mr. Landry, do you have questions?
Mr. Landry. Oh, yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.
First, Admiral, thank you for your service. The Coast Guard
is one of my favorite agencies. Of course, it is not without
some selfish motivation. I fish offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.
If I ever get stranded, always remember my kind comments,
please.
Mr. Peck, I reviewed some of these photos of the new Coast
Guard headquarters. That is a pretty interesting design dig you
all have made on the side of that hill. What is the elevation
change of the construction site?
Mr. Peck. Depends on where we measure. From the Anacostia
Metro station to the top of the hill, 110 feet. That is not the
elevation of the building itself, though, sir.
Mr. Landry. Why did you have to dig the whole hillside up?
Mr. Peck. I think the short answer is that the St.
Elizabeths campus, while it is a large campus, is both--has a
number of historic buildings and is itself an historic
landscape. So when the master planning was done at the project
we did all we could to make reuse of the historic buildings and
to fit in new construction where we could. In this case, a
building as large as the Coast Guard headquarters had--what was
the largest open site we could use happened to be on a
hillside.
Mr. Landry. So how much did that site work cost?
Mr. Peck. That is a--I don't--I have various numbers for
excavation. If you want me to isolate it to the Coast Guard
building itself, I will submit that for the record.
Mr. Landry. OK. Do you have an idea? Five, ten million
dollars?
Mr. Peck. The cost of excavation--and I am being advised by
Mr. Ebadi, who, in answer to Ms. Norton, is probably the one
single reason why from the GSA on this project is on time and
budget. We also have a good partnership with DHS. The cost of
excavation for this building is about $29 million, and that is
the cost of hauling the fill out, also.
Mr. Landry. So it was GSA's decision to dig the hillside
up?
Mr. Peck. It was a decision made when the master plan was
created and agreed upon in 2006.
Mr. Landry. And the master plan, the decision to dig the
whole hillside up at the cost of $26 million or better was made
by you all to protect some view?
Mr. Peck. No, sir. The building--first of all, there was--
in order to get the building on the site, any building requires
excavation.
Mr. Landry. I understand. But not moving a whole hill. What
did ya'll do with all the dirt?
Mr. Peck. It would be really hard to build--this was a
pretty steep slope.
Mr. Landry. You normally don't build on a pretty steep
slope. I am trying to understand. What did ya'll do with all
the dirt?
Mr. Peck. A lot had to be hauled out of the site. Some of
it was contaminated and had to be hauled away.
Mr. Landry. It was contaminated?
Mr. Peck. On most construction sites, some of it, yes, sir.
Mr. Landry. We could have used that on the coast, Mr.
Chairman. It was a lot of dirt.
Mr. Peck. We didn't have to take it that far, Mr. Landry.
Mr. Landry. And so couldn't we have saved the taxpayers
some money by moving it a little further on top of the hill
where we didn't have to excavate the whole hill?
Mr. Peck. Mr. Landry, we were trying to put on this site
several million square feet of office space. To utilize this
site as a consolidated campus, some part of it would have to
occupy this part of the site, which would require excavation.
Mr. Landry. Well, then who picked the site?
Mr. Peck. That was before my time in the General Services
Administration. But in an effort to find a site for the
Department's headquarters, which began when the Department was
established, we were looking for a central location in the
national capital region. This was a piece of large land that
was already owned by the Federal Government, which means we
saved a considerable amount of money by not having to go out
and acquire a site.
Mr. Landry. We couldn't have put it further up on top of
the hill. Is that impossible? We couldn't put it up there by
that I guess that hospital up there?
Mr. Peck. Well, we don't have a site plan up, but I think
you will be able to see, if we show you the entire site plan,
that, but for sloping areas of this site, I don't believe there
would be an area in which you could fit in a building of this
size unless we were to demolish a good number of the historic
buildings.
Mr. Landry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. LoBiondo. Ms. Norton.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Admiral Currier, you say--you express a concern with which
I am in complete sympathy. One of the key concerns expressed by
our employees is transportation due to reduced access to nearby
parking as compared to other current locations. I think the
chairman raised this same concern, and I wish you would speak
to it.
Mr. Peck, if the infrastructure isn't perfectly in place at
the time the building is completed and all of the movement has
taken place to get the employees there, would there be
transportation from public--would there--of course, we always
encourage people in the Federal Government to use public
transportation. Would there be shuttle transportation provided?
Would there be any limits on providing such transportation as
needed? How much parking will be on the site?
Mr. Peck. We will have for the--to start with the last
question, we will have on the site for the use of the Coast
Guard approximately 900 parking spaces in the structured
parking garage, which is being built and which is on the far
right-hand side of the photo that you see on the screen.
To get to that parking, we do need to complete an access
road through First Sterling and when it parallels the 295
freeway. If we do get the funding, even the mark we got in the
Senate, which is less than we requested, we can complete that
access road on time for the building's occupancy.
The Anacostia Metro station is three-quarters of a mile
from this building, which is closer than the current Maiden
leased location that the Coast Guard--closer by a quarter of a
mile than the current leased location of the Coast Guard is to
a Metro station.
One thing, if I may add, although I know it sometimes
sounds counterintuitive, the lack of funding and the hiatus in
funding on the project in the end costs more. The fact that we
got no funding in fiscal year 2011 for that project has already
caused us to take $30 million that we would have spent on other
projects to redesign and reposition utilities for the campus so
that when the Coast Guard building is opened and its operation
center opens we can actually have a functioning building.
Because all those utility tunnels and conduits were going to go
in various different places, it was going to be less expensive
in the long run to continue straight on to phase 2. We have
been able to move funds around so that the building will be
functional when it opens.
Finally, to answer your question, the Department of
Homeland Security, under normal procedures, would fund the
shuttle service to the Metro station; and they do intend to do
that. In any event, we will be funding a shuttle to the Metro
station, whether or not we have the access road complete at
that time.
Ms. Norton. Admiral Currier, we have some information that
there has been some flooding in the buildings that house the
present headquarters. Would you describe the condition of your
present headquarters building?
Admiral Currier. The present headquarters building--well,
the site contains two buildings--what we call the Jemal
building and the Transpoint building--our headquarters is very
low to the river, very close to the level of the river. When
there are tidal surges as a result of hurricanes or serious
storms, we occasionally get flooding inside the building.
We had near-catastrophic flooding a few years back when we
discovered that the building's critical infrastructure,
including generators and power lines, computer lines, were
actually in the subbasement, were flooded and rendered the
headquarters inoperative for some period of time. Subsequently,
money has been spent to harden that site, but it is still
barely adequate for our current function.
So that is the reason, ma'am, as I stated before, that we
are truly looking forward to the move to a more functional,
protected headquarters.
Ms. Norton. Finally, Mr. Peck, the headquarters building of
the Coast Guard now is a leased building, is that not the case?
Mr. Peck. Yes, ma'am, the two buildings.
Ms. Norton. And those funds go to, of course, the owner of
those buildings. Now, as I understand it, the Coast Guard will
pay rent, as it were, to the Federal buildings fund. How will
the Coast Guard benefit from these funds which go to the
Federal buildings fund rather than to the lessor?
Mr. Peck. Well, first of all, of course, even now the
Federal cost of borrowing is less than a private-sector owner's
is. But the shortest answer is that when money comes in to the
Federal buildings fund it is essentially a revolving fund, and
we use the money to maintain and upgrade our buildings.
Particularly over a long period of time, almost any investment
study shows we, as stewards of the taxpayers' dollars, end up
better with an owned building in which we can plow the proceeds
from the rent back into our building in the infrastructure than
if it goes out to private-sector tenants. Particularly when we
have a long-term function that we don't need to move, we don't
intend to move out of, we don't need the flexibility that you
get from being in a lease that you might leave at a couple of
years.
One other thing I would just note is that the building is
being built at least to a LEED gold standard. It will be more
energy efficient.
And I want to make two commitments to the Coast Guard, one
we are going to make to all Federal tenants, which is, if we
realize the energy savings that we hope we will see in running
this building and having a separate co-generation plant on the
site we will share those savings with the tenant. That is
number one.
Number two, if I may take a moment, I want to reiterate in
public what Admiral Currier said. We have agreed on and
committed to that the Coast Guard--neither the Coast Guard nor
DHS will be responsible for any double rent that might be
incurred by the fact that our leases on the current buildings
will still be running at the time that the Coast Guard moves to
St. Elizabeths. GSA will bear that liability.
Ms. Norton. Mr. Peck, is there any chance--could I have one
more question? Is there any chance that this building could
become a white elephant and what would be the effect of leaving
this building uninhabited?
Mr. Peck. We would still bear the cost of maintaining and
securing an empty building. Aside from the embarrassment
factor, there is the fact that the Coast Guard would continue
to operate in a building that is less than optimal. As I say,
we would have the expense of maintaining a significant
investment. Because we are certainly not going--we would have
to mothball the building, and there are costs to that. We would
have to run utilities, and we would have to secure it.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. LoBiondo. Mr. Larsen.
Mr. Larsen. Admiral Currier, it is my prior understanding
that all personal presently locate at the time at the two
Buzzard Points buildings would be relocated, but now I
understand that some non-headquarter functions, such as the
Marine safety center, does not intend to move to the new
headquarters. When was that decision made? And the broader
question, what elements and how many personnel will not be
moving to St. Elizabeths?
Admiral Currier. Thank you, Mr. Larsen.
In the normal administration of the Coast Guard, we have
what we call modernization. I think you have seen the results
of that in some of our acquisition activities and others.
As part of this modernization there was some
reorganization. The civilian personnel entity, what we call
Coast Guard 121, is a staff element of about 80 people, is
being relocated to a separate command inside the beltway, but
they will no longer be a headquarters element. They will be
part of this separate personnel support command that exists.
And the Marine safety center, as you noted, is not a
headquarters function, and their rent costs is actually part
our base. They will be relocated as well. We don't want to
collocate them at headquarters at St. E's.
Those are two very minor in the big-picture adjustments to
our staffs, one of which was a reorganization; the other one is
a relocation of a non-headquarters element.
Mr. Larsen. And so the Coast Guard has budgeted for the
cost of the lease space, continue to lease space at the
Buzzards Point for the Marine safety center and for the leased
costs for moving the 80 or so folks?
Admiral Currier. No, sir. There are two groups of 80
people. Both will be relocated, none will be at Buzzards Point,
and their rent costs are actually in our base.
Mr. Larsen. They are in your base.
Admiral Currier. Yes, sir.
Mr. Larsen. OK, great. That is good.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. LoBiondo. Admiral Currier and Mr. Bathurst, there were
what I think is some critical information and numbers and
information for the subcommittee to be able to better
understand this. You explained how you are working through
this. Tell us when we can expect to be able to hear from you on
some hard numbers. We are a little hesitant to just leave it
open ended, because when we do those things then we take a
blink and we are 6 months later.
Mr. Bathurst. Most of those numbers really are--would be
impacted in the next budget submission from the White House,
and we are working right now to develop that information. So it
is premature for to us talk about the numbers, but we will
definitely have them with the budget request in February.
Mr. LoBiondo. In when?
Mr. Bathurst. With the President's budget request.
Mr. LoBiondo. Could we ask for a December 1st update?
Mr. Bathurst. I believe we can give you a status report of
where we stand with the analysis, but I don't think we will be
able to actually discuss any specific numbers. But we can let
you know where we are moving and moving toward.
Mr. LoBiondo. Well, all of these--I think we were able to
shed a lot of light on it today, but, you know, a lot depends
on what is going to happen in the next month or two, of course,
with continuing resolution, omnibus or how we move forward.
Even if we went with a full Senate number that you have, it
still looks like there is $10 million, $12 million short on how
you do this. So as we move forward I would--I think it would be
preferable, if you have the information, can share it with the
subcommittee informally. But, depending on how it goes, we will
just have to decide whether we call another formal hearing.
Mr. Peck.
Mr. Peck. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
On thing I just wanted to clarify. While we had asked for
$76 million in fiscal 2012 and the Senate mark is $65 million,
we have already taken a look; and it wouldn't be the first time
that we had to be agile to bend a building project to the
amount of money we have. We are confident that we will do what
we need to do within that mark as well to get the building open
on time in 2013. But I also would be happy to give the--
participate with DHS in giving you an update on whatever
numbers we have on December 1st.
Mr. LoBiondo. Sure. Well, we are hopeful that we can get
some good numbers, but the task that is facing the Congress and
the country by the end of the year with the debt limit,
supercommittee, and all that is going into this, if those
numbers slip substantially we have to be able to figure out
what that means and what the implications are and try to put
our brains together on this.
So everybody good here now?
Thank you. The committee is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
