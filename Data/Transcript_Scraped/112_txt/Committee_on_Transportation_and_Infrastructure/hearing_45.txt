HOW TO IMPROVE OPERATIONS
AND IMPLEMENT EFFICIENCIES FOR
THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD

----------

TUESDAY, JULY 26, 2011

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Coast Guard and
Maritime Transportation,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:03 a.m. in
Room 2167, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Frank LoBiondo
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. LoBiondo. Good morning. The subcommittee will come to
order. The subcommittee is meeting today to review various ways
to improve operations and implement efficiencies at the Coast
Guard, as we look to draft legislation to reauthorize the
Service. The Coast Guard's current authorization expires at the
end of this fiscal year. As such, it is time to review the
issues before us, and open the discussion on the legislation.
Today's hearing will do just that, as we will highlight
those issues we wish to address, and discuss the best way
forward among ourselves, and with the Service's senior
leadership. Admirals Currier and Salerno are appearing before
us to provide an opportunity for that discussion. I look
forward to hearing their perspective on how we continue to move
the Service in the right direction.
The crux of any good legislation is a strong foundation.
Our subcommittee has held nine hearings over the first 7 months
of this Congress, and we have identified several issues that
need to be addressed. Today is an opportunity to revisit our
most important priorities and ensure that we are well informed
before we begin to legislate.
As you all know, I am especially interested in issues
including Servicemember parity, challenges and delays in the
Coast Guard's acquisition program, and ways to make operations
more effective. I also want to ensure we are spending taxpayer
dollars efficiently.
Specifically, as I have raised before, I am very concerned
that we have spent over $3 billion to build National Security
Cutters over the last decade, when the GAO recently found that
they provide little additional capability over the 40-year-old
vessels they are replacing. This is really hard to believe, but
something we are certainly going to have to get into.
I am also concerned that taxpayer is going to have to spend
tens of millions more each year to support a new headquarters
building for the Coast Guard. It appears this is being done
just to satisfy the Secretary's desire to consolidate DHS
agencies at the old mental hospital in Anacostia. Now we
understand these costs may rise farther, as the appropriators
have decided not to provide funding to move any additional
agencies. These issues, among others, will be addressed in the
next authorization.
However, it is important that we address them in ways that
actually correct problems, and make the Coast Guard a stronger
organization. The men and women protecting our Nation deserve
the very best. It is incumbent upon us to provide them a strong
reauthorization.
Today we will also examine a marine debris program which is
due for reauthorization this year. As such, it is important we
understand exactly how NOAA administers this program, and how
they envision doing so in the near future. Dr. Bamford of the
National Ocean Service is here today to provide us with that
insight.
And our colleague, Mr. Farr, has taken a special interest
in marine debris, and has introduced a reauthorization bill. We
will have a chance to hear the finer points of his proposal and
explore solutions as we move towards reauthorization.
I want to thank the witnesses for being here today. And
with that, I would like to yield to Mr. Larsen for his
statement.
Mr. Larsen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for
convening this morning's hearing concerning the operations and
programs of the U.S. Coast Guard. We welcome this opportunity,
as we jointly begin the process of developing authorization
legislation for the Service.
The Coast Guard is a multimission agency responsible for a
broad range of activities, including mariner licensing,
emergency oil spill response, vessel inspections, and search
and rescue operations. These and many other activities of the
Service are indispensable, and ensure that our coasts and ocean
resources are protected, that our ocean, great lakes, and
inland waterway commerce remain safe and efficient, and that
our maritime industries continue to be vibrant sources of jobs
and economic opportunity for the American people.
Despite the vital importance of the Coast Guard, the
albatross that has hung around the Service's neck for years is
that rarely, if ever, has it been given the resources
sufficient to meet its responsibilities, even as Congress has
expanded those responsibilities. At our budget oversight
hearing on March 1st, we heard a lot about the Coast Guard
doing more with less. However, I believe we have also
established that the more likely outcome of fewer resources is
that our U.S. Coast Guard will be doing less with less.
I have seen no new information since then to alter this
view. The fiscal year 2011 budget resolution approved in April
largely spared the Coast Guard from Draconian cuts many other
agencies faced. This is cold comfort, however, considering the
massive cuts in discretionary spending across all Federal
programs that are being proposed, portending even less funding
than what is presently available to address the Coast Guard's
many needs and its efficiencies.
We are past time when we can discuss budget cuts in the
absent, or we can blithely toss out bromides and expect the
Coast Guard to secure ports, maintain aids in navigation, or
respond to natural or human caused disasters with diminished
resources. With this thought in mind I urge this morning that
we not simply replow ground we have visited before, but that we
look forward.
Certainly we need to examine the Coast Guard's operations
and programs to ensure they are mission driven, cost effective,
and accountable. But that is not enough. We also need to
constructively engage the Service in developing a sound,
balanced path forward that realigns our expectation with a
level of performance that we can reasonably expect the Coast
Guard to deliver, and we will need to do this within the tight
budgets the Service likely will receive in the foreseeable
future.
As part of this engagement, we should examine joint
programs, of which the Coast Guard is a partner, to see how we
might improve their implementation to better leverage Federal
investments. Partnership programs such as activities
implemented by the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration under the Marine Debris Research,
Prevention, and Reduction Act can offer a tested and effective
business model to expand the capabilities of Federal agencies,
while also building effective working relationships with non-
Federal stakeholders.
I look forward to hearing the views of our colleague from
California, Representative Sam Farr, on the marine debris
programs implemented by the Coast Guard and NOAA, and I look
forward to working with him and Chairman LoBiondo in moving his
legislation that would reauthorize a marine debris act through
the committee.
I also urge, Mr. Chairman, that as we move ahead with the
Coast Guard reauthorization bill, that we not lose track of
several good ideas to increase economic opportunity and enhance
jobs that were raised during the June 14th hearing concerning
the marine transportation system. Job creation remains my
highest priority. And if there is an opportunity to move
legislation in this Congress that can jumpstart job growth in
the maritime sector and put people back to work on the docks
and at sea, I stand ready and willing to work with you,
shoulder to shoulder, to reach a successful outcome.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you, Mr. Larsen. Master Chief Coble, do
you have an opening statement?
Mr. Coble. No statement, sir.
Mr. LoBiondo. OK. Thank you for being here. Our first
witness today is the Honorable Sam Farr, representing
California's 17th District. Sam, thank you for appearing here
today, and we look forward to hearing your testimony.

TESTIMONY OF HON. SAM FARR, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

Mr. Farr. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. As a
legislator with a Coast Guard station in my district, I really
appreciate you doing this oversight hearing, and look forward
to working with you.
But I am here also to thank you for holding the hearing on
the bill H.R. 1171. This is a bill that Don Young and myself
have introduced, along with other Members, and we are very
appreciative of the opportunity to have this hearing.
Our oceans are in trouble. And we have exclusive
jurisdiction--ownership, essentially--out to 200 miles around
the continental United States. And much of it is full of debris
and garbage, both domestic and foreign, that has come from
other parts of the world. Fourteen billion pounds of trash end
up on our beaches and in the ocean every year, and they are the
dumping ground for everything we don't want on land. When you
think about it, our sewage outfall goes in there, garbage goes
in there. We've even had nuclear waste stored in the oceans off
San Francisco. The list goes on and on. When we wanted to dump
the old Bay Bridge, we dumped it in the ocean offshore, and
fishermen get their nets stuck in that huge mess of an
industrial dumping site.
We have over 270 species that are impacted by ocean trash,
and many of those species are commercial fisheries. And up to
100,000 marine mammals die each year from marine debris.
In addition to these environmental impacts, the economic
impacts of marine debris can be devastating. Every year, over
77.8 million Americans from all over the country visit a beach.
Most of our constituents, no matter where you are in the United
States, take time to go to the beaches, making large
contributions to the local tourism economy. What would happen
if you were visiting a beach and it looked like this picture up
here on the wall? Imagine the impact of trash to the businesses
that are trying to survive off of the tourism caused by the
attraction of the beach, and then to encounter that kind of
trash?
So, Mr. Chairman, it is--as you know, in New Jersey, where
in 1988 the State woke up the world with the announcement of
all the medical waste that had washed ashore. I remember our
former colleague, Jim Saxon, just becoming a big convert on
cleaning up the oceans because of that incident that hit both
New Jersey and New York. This incident in 1988 cost $3.6
billion in lost tourism revenues.
Our country has come a long way since then, but keeping our
beaches clean still requires significant resources. For
example, the city of Long Beach in California spends a whopping
$17 million each year keeping its beaches trash free.
In 2006, Congress recognized this problem by passing, and
without a single negative vote, the original Marine Debris Act,
which this bill reauthorizes. The law established programs
within NOAA and the Coast Guard to address the problem of
marine debris.
Additionally, the law laid the foundation for partnerships
between Coast Guard, NOAA, and other Federal agencies with the
creation of an interagency marine debris coordinating
committee. Since enacted, this multi-agency approach has
allowed NOAA and the Coast Guard to coordinate research
priorities, monitoring techniques, education programs, and
regulatory actions. Ultimately, these Federal partnerships let
NOAA and the Coast Guard to more with limited resources.
NOAA and the Coast Guard have also formed public-private
partnerships with local communities, academic institutions, and
the private sector and the fishing industry. These public-
private partnerships leverage private funds, resulting in more
resourceful and successful Federal programs. These partnerships
have been particularly effective in addressing derelict fishing
gear. Derelict gear can devastate the value of marine
fisheries.
For example, over $250 million of marketable lobster is
lost every year in the U.S. to derelict gear, a process called
ghost fishing--the gear is lost, and it just keeps floating
around, and gets snagged--and things get snagged into it and
never get recovered. In a time where our fishermen are already
facing economic challenges, losses of this magnitude are simply
unacceptable.
In response to this, we have a program called Fishing for
Energy, a partnership formed between the Coast Guard, NOAA and
Covanta Energy and Schnitzer Steel. In this partnership, NOAA
and the Coast Guard remove derelict gear from the marine
environment. Then Covanta Energy and Schnitzer Steel recycle
the gear, and produce electricity.
In the northwest Hawaiian Islands, over 1.4 million pounds
of derelict gear have been removed and recycled to produce
enough electricity to power 260 homes for an entire year.
In addition, the Fishing for Energy partnership has
installed recycling bins at 25 ports across the country, where
fishermen can dispose of their old gear at no cost. This
provides the fisherman an alternative to costly landfill
disposal, as well as an incentive to retrieve any derelict gear
that they might find in the water. These bins have already
accumulated over a million pounds of gear. In just Cape May,
New Jersey, the bins have collected over 48 tons--I believe
that's in your district.
In addition to partnerships that increase efficiency,
Federal resources are further amplified by granting matching
requirements of at least 50 percent. In 2005 through 2009, this
law has funded 86 projects with only $6.3 million. And these
funds leveraged an additional $7.9 million in non-Federal
funds.
One project in particular that is funded through the law is
the International Coastal Cleanup. In 2010 the United States
had over 240,000 volunteers who cleaned up 4.5 million pounds
of trash. This vast participation indicates that the public
support for marine debris cleanup is widespread.
I have over 25 letters of support from a variety of
stakeholders including fishermen, mapping companies, science
organizations, local non-profits, and I ask that these letters
be submitted to the record.
In sum, both interagency and public-private partnerships
have leveraged the resources and capacity of the Coast Guard.
We must act now to ensure that these partnerships are not only
maintained, but are strengthened. It is through these
partnerships that our country can most effectively and
efficiently address the impacts of ocean trash on marine
ecosystems, coastal economies, and navigation safety. With
reauthorization, a steady stream of funding, the Coast Guard
will continue to make significant strides in tackling the
problem of marine debris.
So, I ask this committee to reauthorize this bill. There is
a companion bill in the Senate introduced by Senator Inouye,
and we hope that both of those bills will be moving.
Mr. LoBiondo. OK, Sam, thank you for your testimony today,
for your leadership on this issue. Do we have any Members that
wish to comment on Mr. Farr's?
[No response.]
Mr. LoBiondo. thank you, Sam, we will be in touch.
Mr. Farr. Thank you very much. Thank you for your time.
Mr. LoBiondo. We will now be prepared for the second panel
of witnesses, that will include Coast Guard Vice Admiral John
Currier, the deputy commandant for mission support; Vice
Admiral Brian Salerno, the deputy commandant for operations,
and Dr. Holly Bamford, deputy assistant administrator at the
National Ocean Service. I welcome our guests here today.
Let me start off by thanking the Coast Guard for the
response that they provided us that--in a letter that we sent
to Secretary Napolitano concerning the delivery of the Coast
Guard's fleet mix analysis. I appreciate that.
Admiral Currier, the floor is yours.

TESTIMONY OF VICE ADMIRAL JOHN CURRIER, DEPUTY COMMANDANT FOR
MISSION SUPPORT, UNITED STATES COAST GUARD; VICE ADMIRAL BRIAN
SALERNO, DEPUTY COMMANDANT FOR OPERATIONS, UNITED STATES COAST
GUARD; AND HOLLY BAMFORD, PH.D., DEPUTY ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR
FOR THE NATIONAL OCEAN SERVICE, NATIONAL OCEANIC AND
ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION

Admiral Currier. Thank you, sir. Chairman LoBiondo, Ranking
Member Larsen, members of the subcommittee, thank you for the
opportunity to discuss Coast Guard mission support activities
as part of the subcommittee's efforts to develop a 2011
authorization bill for the Coast Guard.
As the deputy commandant for mission support, I have
primary responsibility to ensure that Coast Guard has the
people, platforms, systems, and logistics necessary to meet our
mission demands. This could not be accomplished without the
resources and authorities that are provided to us and the
Service by Congress and the administration.
I want to take this opportunity to note the role of this
subcommittee, including language in the Coast Guard
Authorization Act of 2010 that further strengthens the
capabilities of our acquisition program, and enhances housing
and child care benefits to Coast Guardsmen on a par with those
available to the armed services. I look forward to working with
the subcommittee to continue these efforts, as you continue the
development of authorizing legislation.
Since the creation of a centralized acquisition directorate
in 2007, and continuing with the establishment of mission
support enterprise, the Coast Guard as made significant changes
that are resulting in improved performance and management over
acquisition programs. This includes enhanced governance through
compliance with requirements under our major systems
acquisitions manual, or MSAM, and expanded roles for Coast
Guard technical authorities in the Department of Homeland
Security. We are better positioned now to execute all aspects
of the acquisition lifecycle, including follow-on logistics,
and to consider tough trade-offs when necessary.
Our recapitalized assets are in the field today, sir,
providing enhanced safety and security for the American public.
We have accepted delivery of two National Security Cutters, and
they are demonstrating capabilities beyond our legacy fleet,
and challenging conditions in the Bering Sea and the eastern
Pacific. The third cutter, Stratton, has just completed
successful builder's trials. In May, the first steel was cut
for the fourth hull, and we anticipate awarding a production
contract for the fifth NSC later this summer.
The commandant has frequently stated that we need eight
NSCs, and we are on our way to acquiring these critical assets
for the Coast Guard with stable requirements, predictable
costs, and pre-identified risk. At the same time, the first
seven hulls of the Fast Response Cutter are under production,
and we are conducting pre-acquisition activities for the
Offshore Patrol Cutter fleet. Together with our recapitalized
aviation fleet, small boats, and C4ISR assets, these cutters
will bring enhanced capabilities across the Coast Guard's
mission set.
The commandant has made the recapitalization one of our
Service's highest priorities, and I know that this subcommittee
shares our interest in replacing these old ships and aircraft
as quickly as possible at the best value to the American
taxpayer.
These initiatives would not come to fruition without the
men and women who formed the very core of our organization.
Much of the Coast Guard's work is done under extremely
challenging conditions. But we continue to attract and retain a
highly skilled workforce.
As you are aware, we are moving forward with construction
of the new Coast Guard headquarters at St. Elizabeths campus,
which is also the result--which will result in a more efficient
Coast Guard at the programmatic level. With several
headquarters elements in one location, I am confident that we
will benefit from increased collaboration and efficiency, not
only within our organization, but also through partnership with
the subsequent DHS agency collocations, or relocations to that
site.
However, we anticipate our St. Elizabeths lease cost to
exceed that we are currently spending on leases. The projected
recurrent lease cost for the Coast Guard's portion of St.
Elizabeths is approximately $95 million per year, over $42
million more than we are currently paying for the two buildings
that we occupy. We are currently working closely with the
Department to close that gap and move forward with this
important transition.
Thank you, sir, for the opportunity to discuss the efforts
of the mission support organization. And I will be glad to
answer any questions that you might have. Thank you.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you, Admiral.
Admiral Salerno, you are recognized.
Admiral Salerno. Good morning, Chairman LoBiondo, Ranking
Member Larsen, and distinguished members of the subcommittee.
Very happy to be here to testify, together with my good friend,
Vice Admiral Currier, and update you on how we are improving
operations and implementing efficiencies within the Coast
Guard.
The Coast Guard has used the authority provided by the 2010
authorization act to finalize our leadership structure.
Specifically, we have created a three-star deputy commandant
for mission support and a three-star deputy commandant for
operations. This move helps provide clarity to the entire
Service. It underscores that every function performed by our
workforce is tied either to mission execution or to mission
support, and it reinforces the mutually dependent nature of
these two broad categories of work.
As the deputy commandant for operations, my
responsibilities include developing the operational
requirements necessary to accomplish Coast Guard missions. This
includes the establishment of performance plans, and then
tracking performance to ensure we are meeting our objectives.
It also includes identifying the right characteristics for the
ships, aircraft boats, communications, and sensor systems
needed to operate effectively.
And equally important, it involves looking to the
professionalism of our workforce, by making sure that we have
the proper policies and guidance in place for our people to
have a clear understanding of how to operate, how to conduct
their mission safely and efficiently, and with a proper focus
on our national maritime interest and the public we serve.
The majority of the 137 provisions of the Coast Guard
Authorization Act of 2010 represent action items for which I am
responsible. To comment on just a few aspects of the act, we
have identified 29 provisions of the act which require
promulgation of regulations; 16 of these are being incorporated
into existing rulemaking projects in order to expedite their
implementation. We are, of course, also actively working on the
other 13 projects.
The act also requires 54 new congressional reports, of
which 9 have already been delivered to Congress, and the
remaining are either in progress or under review.
In May the Coast Guard briefed the subcommittee staff on
our progress achieving the action items under the authorization
act. Since that time, we have satisfied some additional
requirements, and I am pleased to note that the Coast Guard
completed its review of the rules for the use of force by U.S.
merchant vessels in defense against piracy, and we have
provided guidance to the industry.
Also, the high-latitude study was provided to Congress on
July 20th, as you mentioned, and the notice of proposed
rulemaking for towing vessels has been sent to the Federal
Register.
Recently the Coast Guard also testified on our regulatory
program, and we highlighted the many improvements we have been
able to put in place, thanks to the investments made by
Congress in 2008 and 2009. These investments have allowed us to
reduce the average time required to produce regulations, and
reduce the backlog of regulatory projects. Although the
downward trend has been somewhat offset by the new projects
added by the 2010 authorization act, we expect that the
internal efficiencies will continue to result in reduced
regulatory backlog over time.
I want to assure the committee that we take very seriously
the direction provided by Congress. In organizing our
regulatory workload we ascribe the highest priority to
rulemaking projects which are mandated by legislation. In
addition, we make every effort to ensure that the regulations
we promulgate are practical, effective, and are pursued by the
full appreciation of the economic burden on those who must
comply with them. Thank you, and I look forward to answering
your questions.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you, Admiral.
Dr. Bamford, you are recognized.
Ms. Bamford. Good morning. Mr. Chairman and members of the
subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to testify on H.R.
1171, the Marine Debris Act Reauthorization Amendment of 2011.
Previous to my current position, I served as director of
NOAA's marine debris program, and was involved in the inception
in 2005. I look forward to contributing my experience on marine
debris at today's hearing. To that end, I would like to share
with you a story.
It was August 29, 2005, a day he will never forget.
Returning from the Coast Guard office in New Orleans to his
home in Baton Rouge, Charlie Henry, from NOAA's office of
response and restoration, knew something big was coming. But he
had no idea how just terrible the force would be. Born in
Louisiana, and working for NOAA as a regional scientific
support coordinator, Charlie knew from experience, and the
reports coming through the weather service, that it was going
to be a devastating storm. He feared the incredible crushing
blow that would turn out to be the most destructive hurricane
to hit the United States, Hurricane Katrina.
That part of the story might sound familiar to you. The
part that may not know is the addition to the devastating
injury to life on land, Hurricane Katrina also destroyed marine
infrastructure on a wide scale, depositing enormous amounts of
debris into the water, both on and off shore. This posed an
even further--and many times unseen--threat to people, boats,
navigation, and commercial activities.
Fishing is a major way of life in the Gulf Coast, where
commercial fishing alone accounted for an estimated value of
$700 million a year. As the Gulf began to rebuild their lives
in the wake of the hurricane, they encounter dangerous debris
in channels and offshore Gulf waters.
Following the storm, the Coast Guard, the Army Corps, and
NOAA worked together to survey and clear debris from major
navigational waterways, as mandated by existing requirements.
Near shore areas outside of navigable waterways, however, were
not required to be cleared. Yet many areas contain large
amounts of debris in the fishing regions.
To help restore the area's fishing grounds and reduce the
risk to public safety, in 2006 and 2007 Congress authorized
supplemental funding to NOAA for surveying and mapping these
areas that were impacted by Hurricane Katrina along the coast
of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. It was because of the
Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and Reduction Act, which
established a formal NOAA program in NOAA, that my team were
able to fulfill the request of Congress for NOAA to carry out
these tasks.
The opportunity to provide real assistance to the storm
ravaged community meant a tremendous amount to my team, to my
friend and colleague, Charlie Henry, and to me, as a fellow
American. Working with Charlie and NOAA's office of coast
survey, we surveyed over 1,570 square nautical miles, and
identified over 7,000 marine debris hazards that were plotted
on 137 marine debris maps. Some of the areas have not been
surveyed since the 1940s, so NOAA was able to use these data to
update nautical charts covering the regions, including over 200
dangerous to navigation.
The debris information was provided to the Coast Guard, to
FEMA, States, in order to assist in debris assessments and
removal projects. We also developed a public Web site that grew
exponentially with visits from boaters and fishermen who
downloaded the debris maps to avoid debris that could damage
their boats and snag their gear.
In the end, NOAA provided a much-needed service to the Gulf
Coast community in support of recovery, and this experience
helped shape NOAA's marine debris efforts and subsequent
disasters, such as response to tsunami in American Samoa in
September of 2009, and the recent tsunami in Japan.
The story I recounted today is on an acute incident
addressed by the marine debris program in NOAA. But it's those
chronic debris issues that NOAA deals with on a regular basis
that accounts for the majority of our efforts. The Marine
Debris Act of 2005 authorized NOAA to establish a program to
reduce and prevent the impacts of marine debris on the marine
environment. The Reauthorization Amendment of 2011 provides a
much stronger authority and clearer guidance to NOAA to address
the impacts of various types of debris on a local, regional,
national, and international scale.
The reauthorization amendment calls out NOAA's role in
national regional coordination to assist the States, Indian
tribes, and regional organizations to address marine debris
that are particular to their areas. This strengthens the role
of our regional coordination station around the country,
including Hawaii, Alaska, the west, the east, the Gulf Coast,
and the Great Lakes.
It also provides NOAA the authority to develop and
implement strategies to promote international action to reduce
the incidence of marine debris, such as supporting our efforts
to assess debris generated from the Japanese tsunami.
Furthermore, the reauthorization directs NOAA to develop
the needed tools and products to improve efforts to address
marine debris, and make these available to researchers, the
marine debris community, and the general public.
NOAA is committed to the goal of reducing the impacts of
marine debris on our coasts and oceans, and I look forward to
working with the subcommittee to achieve this outcome.
Thank you again for the invitation for me to discuss H.R.
1171, and the benefits of reauthorizing this NOAA program. I am
happy to address any questions. Thank you.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you very much. Admiral Currier and/or
Salerno, these next couple of questions will be for you.
On the asset recapitalization programs, in spite of a
series of acquisition reforms undertaken by the Coast Guard,
there are still significant capability gaps and delays in
acquisition projects. The Coast Guard has spent 10 years and
more than $3.5 billion to acquire five National Security
Cutters.
Congress agreed to the purchase of these vessels, based on
a greatly enhanced geographic area the cutters could cover with
two new classes of cutter boats, aerial unmanned vehicles, and
a greater number of days at sea the cutters could achieve. GAO
has recently found that the NSC provide no additional
capabilities over the existing 40-year-plus-old cutters. The
two new classes of cutters have not been acquired, nor is there
a plan to provide unmanned aerial vehicles. The NSC's vessels
operate away from port only half of the year.
Why does the Service continue to face delays in selecting
and acquiring cutter boats for the National Security Cutter,
and when will these boats be acquired?
Admiral Salerno. Sir, if you will permit us, we will maybe
take different parts of that question and answer it. I would
like to talk upfront just about the difference between the NSC
and the 378, the High Endurance Cutters.
There is a substantial difference between the two vessels,
sir. This program was designed to provide additional
capability. That is why we only have 8 NSCs at the program of
record, versus the 12 HECs. But just to give you a flavor, the
National Security Cutter has the ability to land an H60
helicopter; the 378 does not. The NSC can accommodate 2 H65
helicopters; the 378 can only accommodate 1. NSC will have two
Over-The-Horizon cutter boats versus one on the High Endurance
Cutter. And it also has the skiff capabilities for classified
material, which is not resident in the 378.
What we have noticed and observed in the deployment of
Bertholf, the first operational NSC, she has been extremely
effective, both in her counterdrug deployments--involved in two
drug interdictions, highly effective in that role, using her
cutter boats that are equipped with the vessel currently. And
we also had experience in Alaska, where Bertholf was able to
launch and recover aircraft in 20-foot seas, which is
substantially greater than what is--the capabilities of the
High Endurance Cutter, which is closer to 8-foot seas. So, we
are seeing a dramatic increase in capability with this ship, by
design.
Now, the cutter boats, as you point out, the ones that are
on board right now will not be the ultimate boats that will be
on board. There is a cutter boat OTH-IV, the operational
requirements are being worked now. But we will replace the
existing OTH boats with that OTH-IV, as well as a long-range
interceptor. So, some of the boat issues are still playing out
as separate acquisitions, but companion acquisitions to the
ship acquisition.
Unmanned aerial systems, likewise. We continue to work very
closely with the U.S. Navy on shipboard systems. I think you
are aware we have been working with them on the fire scout. But
we are also looking at other options, such as scanned eagle.
And on land-based UAS, of course, we are working with CBP.
And then let me ask my colleague, Admiral Currier, to talk
about some of the acquisition-specific aspects of your
question.
Admiral Currier. Thank you, Admiral Salerno. Sir, we are in
the middle of acquiring a complex system, based on the National
Security Cutter, but it is a system. It's a system that
encompasses fast response boats that prosecute the missions,
meet the threats; a MDA package including unmanned aerial
vehicles, eventually; manned helicopters, supplemented by
manned and unmanned longer range, higher altitude surveillance,
capped by a C4I system that actually allows us to not only
capture the data, but prosecute the data to mission effect.
This is a complex acquisition, and we have had our issues
beginning the National Security Cutter acquisitions, but I
believe we're on track, sir. As I said in my opening statement,
we have one in service, the second one is about to go into
service. The third one is about to be accepted by the Coast
Guard. We are cutting steel on four, and we are about to award
the contract on five.
We are now in an era of stable requirements, fixed-price
contracts, where risks are identified and quantified and known
upfront. We have a mature department whose acquisition
oversight is enhancing our ability to acquire. And with the
interest that--I thank you again for the interest of this
committee--the input and support of this committee has also
enhanced our ability to acquire these systems.
This complex acquisition can't be brought together in total
harmony. There are design issues, there are schedule issues
that we hit. However, as we bring the National Security Cutter
on board, we are progressing unmanned aerial vehicles. We have
integrated our manned helicopters with them.
We are in an aggressive program to buy two types of boats.
And what we discovered, sir, is that, rather than buy an
individual small boat for each class of cutter that we're
buying, we now will buy only two types of small boats, a 7-
meter fast prosecutor, and an 11-meter, longer range
interceptor. The first one that was--the first long-range
interceptor that was delivered could not do the job. The
requirements were such that the state-of-the-art boat building
did not get us there. Caused us some delays. We are back out
with design on that boat now.
The shorter range, faster boat is--we are--we have awarded
a contract to four companies to design prototypes, and we will
down-select one and roll right into production next year. So I
think we are on track here.
As far as the unmanned aerial vehicle goes, I was part of
the group that made the decision to extract us from our
original foray into that--the science of unmanned aerial
vehicles. The Coast Guard is a midsized Federal agency with
some distinct capabilities, but also some limitations. We do
not have the ability to do the science required for integration
of a rotary wing unmanned aerial vehicle. So we partnered with
the Navy, and we are closely partnering with them today as they
develop their solutions. They are integrating our requirements
into them.
So, sir, I think this is a success story. It is not
perfect, by a long shot. But we are on track today, as I said
before, to a cost control environment where risks are
predicted, and schedules are adhered to. Thank you, sir.
Mr. LoBiondo. Well, you should by now know that this
subcommittee are some of your biggest cheerleaders. But if a
Member of Congress picks up this GAO report--if you put
yourself in their shoes--this is not a good story.
And as we get into tighter and tighter and tighter
appropriations and budget cycles, the stories that don't read
well are the ones that become the easiest targets. I don't
think I need to explain that further, of what's at stake here.
A lot of us have worked long and hard to pump up the
acquisition dollars and get us there.
So I have got some additional questions, but I want to now
split it up a little bit and turn to Mr. Larsen.
Mr. Larsen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With regards to the
headquarters relocation, the Homeland Security Appropriations
Act for fiscal year 2012 didn't include funding for agencies
within the Department, except the Coast Guard, to relocate to
the new campus. And of course, we've got some issues with the
lease. Can you cover for us what you are doing to try to
decrease the difference in the lease cost between what your
current lease costs are, and what your lease cost will be at
St. Elizabeths?
Admiral Currier. Yes, sir. Thank you for that question.
First of all, let me back it up just a second, if I could,
and just say I have walked the ground over there. We have
looked very closely at the design. We have collaborated with
both the Department of Homeland Security and the General
Services Administration on the design of the campus. I think I
can say with a pretty solid level of confidence that we will be
better off there, in a consolidated environment.
There are deltas, there are gaps in the lease of what we
are paying now to what we will be paying over there, and we are
working closely with the Department, as we work our budget in
2013 and 2014 in the outyears to ensure that no Coast Guard
operational capabilities are degraded because of the lease cost
in moving to St. Elizabeths. So----
Mr. Larsen. But how are you going to do that? I understand
you're going to try to do that, but you're talking about a $42
million difference, is that right, per year?
Admiral Currier. Well, our projection at this point for
fiscal year 2013, because we will have a shared GSA lease cost
on the existing facility, and also accepting some level of
occupancy at St. E's, plus the move costs, are about a $54
million tag over what we are paying now for steady-state
occupancy of the two buildings we are in.
We are, as I said, working closely with the Department to
find out where that fits in the Coast Guard top line, where
that fits in the Department's top line. But they have--in close
collaboration with the under secretary for management, with
whom I work on a near-daily basis, we are looking for those
solutions. I cannot give you the details of the solutions, it
is still projected in the 2013 budget, which is under--being
worked at this time. It is fully recognized, and our goal is
that we will have no compromise in Coast Guard operations due
to any increased lease cost for the new facility.
Mr. Larsen. Dr. Bamford, with regards to the 1171, in your
testimony you noted there is one additional change you
suggested in your written statement, that Congress should
revise the definition of the term ``marine debris'' to adopt
the definition developed jointly between NOAA and the Coast
Guard.
Are there any other changes you are suggesting to the bill?
To the--through reauthorization are you suggesting other
changes, beyond that one?
Ms. Bamford. No.
Mr. Larsen. So that--so the main change would be the
definition of ``marine debris''?
Ms. Bamford. That is correct. We have--in the previous bill
of 2005 we worked directly with the Coast Guard in developing a
definition that has now been put into law. We had out for
public comment, so we support that previous definition that was
worked in joint with the Coast Guard.
Mr. Larsen. OK. NOAA awarded $4.6 million under the
Recovery Act to the Northwest Straits Marine Conservation
Foundation. And that enabled the Foundation to remove over
3,900 derelict fishing nets. In fact, I was out a few weeks
back on Alden Bank with some of the folks between Point Roberts
and Lummi Island, pulling up gear. I was not personally pulling
up gear. I have no intention of becoming a certified diver and
going 50 feet down into the cold waters of Puget Sound. That's
why you have people doing that.
But have all those funds been awarded under the grant, been
obligated?
Ms. Bamford. Yes, sir. All the funds have been awarded, and
it was an 18-month project. They put about--an estimated 20
full-time jobs were created through that project. It was--not
everybody was a full-time employee, so about 50 individuals
actually were brought into that, including divers, biologists,
people working through and sieving through those nets. A number
of different species--I think over 130,000 different species
were captured in those nets, and they were fully removed, as
you mentioned, from Puget Sound.
Mr. Larsen. Yes, and were actually pulled up--
unfortunately, pulled up dead female rock crab and female
Dungeness crab that obviously were not able to go on and
produce little baby crabs.
Ms. Bamford. Yes.
Mr. Larsen. But some of the result of that is they seem to
be thinking a growing abalone population up near Point Roberts,
there is a benefit of it.
Back to the Coast Guard, if I might--Representative Young,
do you have a comment on that?
Mr. Young. I just couldn't understand what you were saying
about a little crab, but----
Mr. Larsen. You couldn't understand what I was saying?
[Laughter.]
Mr. Larsen. Admiral Currier, are there other parity issues
that are high priority for the Coast Guard, other than the
parity issues with regards to the armed services?
Admiral Currier. Yes, sir. Parity issues--I would say one
of our prime parity issues would be the Title 10, Title 14
utilization reserve, and to ensure that they are treated with
parity, as far as paid benefits, and all the things that come
with active duty service.
To give you an example, we had people sitting next to each
other in Deepwater Horizon who were active under Title 10,
other people activated under Title 14, and they were not
receiving the same benefit package. So we really need to work
on that, and we are looking for the committee's support in
that.
Other areas of parity, we have made great strides in
housing, but we have more progress that could be made in that
area. Those are probably two main thrusts that we could look
toward in the future. Of course our paid benefits for active
duty are aligned with the defense authorization bill,
appropriations bill, so that is pretty well taken care of. But
there are some second-, third-tier, fourth-tier effects in
medical, in housing, and those type areas that we would look
for the committee's support in.
Mr. Larsen. OK. Does the Coast Guard need some type of
enhanced leasing authority, and has the Service looked into
this issue?
Admiral Currier. I am sorry, sir, I didn't hear that.
Mr. Larsen. Well, it is my understanding that some Federal
agencies have authority to enter into long-term leases of
properties under their control in order to generate income that
could be used to supplement appropriations. Does the Coast
Guard need some type of enhanced leasing authority like that,
and has the Service looked into that issue?
Admiral Currier. Yes, sir. I think we could use--we would
like to achieve parity with the Department of Defense, as far
as terms of a lease go for excess Coast Guard property, or
property that is not actively being used.
Mr. Larsen. Yes.
Admiral Currier. I think that the terms of lease that we
are constrained under are 5-year, which allows the commandant
to lease for 5 years. But that is not viable with many
commercial entities that would want to engage the Coast Guard
in that type of lease.
I believe, sir, that the Department of Defense has
authority for 20-year leases, and I think we would like to
achieve that parity. It would put us in a better position.
Mr. Larsen. OK. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. LoBiondo. Mr. Young, would you like to be recognized?
Mr. Young. I would like to be recognized, Mr. Chairman. I
do appreciate the Coast Guard, appreciate you having the
hearings.
Vice Admiral, the budget justifications suggest the United
States will take one of our polar ice breakers out of service,
and return to contracting with other nations for ice breaking
operations. This is problematic for me, for two reasons. First,
we would be sending United States taxpayer money to pay a
foreign entity for a job we would be capable of accomplishing
if we would properly maintain our own ice-breaking fleet, and
second is that we have tried this before only to find that
foreign ice breakers were not reliable, and our own ice
breakers were called out of moth balls to action.
Are there other basic service or activities in which the
Coast Guard regularly contracts a foreign entity?
Admiral Salerno. Sir, in that context, the only other
example would be the break-out of Thule, Greenland, the DOD
facility there, which is a Coast Guard responsibility, and we
do have an agreement with the Canadian Government for that
break-out. So they are, in fact, doing that on our behalf.
Mr. Young. Well, let's go back to the ice breakers. Do
you--who do we contract with the ice breakers, and do they have
conflicting interests in the Arctic with the United States of
America?
Admiral Salerno. Sir, the Coast Guard does not directly
contract with any foreign ice breakers. Foreign ice breakers
have been used for the break-out of McMurdo Station in
Antarctica. That contracting has been arranged through the
National Science Foundation. In recent years they have used a
Swedish ice breaker named Oden for that purpose, with U.S.
Coast Guard ice breakers on standby, you know, should there be
a problem.
As you point out, sir, we currently have only one ice
breaker that is fully operational. That is the cutter Healey.
She is a medium ice breaker used predominantly for science
activity in the Arctic. The two ``Polars'' are currently not
operational. One is slated to be decommissioned, that's Polar
Sea. And Polar Star is being refurbished to be put back into
service in 2013, which will give her an extended life of about
an additional 7 years.
That is the Nation's ice breaking capacity, sir. We are the
only entity in the U.S. Government that operates ice breakers.
Mr. Young. Well, see, this is my question. You are way
behind in ice breaking. I happen to fund those three ice
breakers we have, and they're old. They weren't maintained. You
tried your best. I think we are re-engineering one of them, but
by decommissioning--what's the budget cost to decommission the
Polar Star?
Admiral Currier. Sir, we are going to decommission Polar
Star and use some of the----
Mr. Young. I said cost.
Admiral Currier. We're looking at--$5 million, sir, is the
figure I have for decommissioning.
Mr. Young. If you keep it in commission, what does it cost?
Admiral Currier. Well, sir, these ships, as you pointed
out, are very difficult to maintain, and the service that they
render is very hard on ships. We looked at a $62 million
refurbishment of Polar Star to get her in a condition
approaching what it needs to be for return to service. So that
is currently what we have spent on Polar Star.
Mr. Young. And that brings up my point of this whole
questioning. You know, I have been in these hearings every
time, and asked you why you don't lease some American ship
builder to build a ship. Why do you have to own a breaker, when
it costs you so much? And even when we recommission those
ships, repair to any one of--they're very small ships.
Admiral Currier. Sir, the----
Mr. Young. And we have a big responsibility in the Arctic.
And I have got the numbers about leasing a vessel, the
maintenance taken by the builder, and crewing of and manning
of. And I do believe, if you want to look at the money--because
you're not going to get the money to building a new Coast Guard
cutter--I mean ice breaker for the Coast Guard, not on this
present climate. And we need to be up there, because you know
what's happening. All their--Iceland, Greenland, Canada,
they're all being involved in the Arctic, and we are sitting on
our thumbs.
So what is wrong with leasing a vessel?
Admiral Salerno. Sir, if I could just take a stab at that--
--
Mr. Young. Other than being--we have to own our own
vessels, just like NOAA, which I never understood. Extremely
expensive. Now, we're in a real crunch, money-wise. So we
better wake up, because you ain't going to get them. And then
the United States is behind us.
So, look at how the bottom dollar--go ahead, Admiral.
Admiral Salerno. Yes, sir. Just a quick answer to your
question. We have made a business case analysis of lease versus
own in the past that was done, I think, about 15 years ago. We
are redoing that now. I don't have the answer for you yet. But
I think that is an option that we need to consider as we go
forward, and define what our needs are in the Arctic, given the
changing conditions there.
Part of the high-latitude study is looking at our missions.
We are taking that study, converting it into a mission analysis
report, which will give greater definition to that, which will
trigger another study called a mission needs study, which will
look at various options as to how we accomplish those missions.
So, we didn't want to jump to the answer before we do the
analysis. We know we will need new capability to operate in the
arctic, as those conditions change, and there is more human
activity there. As far as the solutions for how we achieve
that, that is the subject of this ongoing study.
Mr. Young. All I ask you--Mr. Chairman, if I may--all I ask
you is keep an open mind and look at the bottom dollar, as far
as maintenance. Having to put them back in recommission after
35 years, you turn them back, you're through with them, you've
done your duty.
And thank you, by the way, for the high-latitude study,
finally. I hope this next study doesn't take as long. So get
back to us as soon as you can, because this is very, very
important. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you, Mr. Young. Mr. Cravaack?
Mr. Cravaack. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to the
United States Coast Guard for all the men and women and all the
sacrifices that you do on a daily basis that none of us really
know about. So thank you to the sailors and airmen of the Coast
Guard.
Admiral Currier, if you don't mind, sir, in regards to
Coast Guard Authorization Act, you stated in your testimony
that the Coast Guard initiated action of all 137 provisions of
the act which service is responsible.
Prior to 2010 the authorization act of all licensed
mariners would require a TWIC card. And section 809 of the 2010
Coast Guard Authorization Act now requires that only mariners
who are allowed in secure spaces, unescorted access to secure
area of a vessel, to obtain a TWIC. And thank you very much for
that; that was great foresight.
Has section 809 been fully implemented?
Admiral Salerno. Sir, it is not fully implemented, but we
are working as rapidly as possible to fully implement that. We
clearly understand the intent of the law. We are trying to work
with our department on some harmonization of capturing
biometric information, which we need for the license--not
necessarily for the security background check, but for safety
and suitability, which is a separate requirement for the
license.
Previously, the TWIC satisfied that function. So we have to
separate that out somehow. So we have a plan ahead which we are
working the details with the Department on how to do that, and
make it as simple and as painless as possible for the
individual mariner.
Mr. Cravaack. Appreciate that. And as Chairman LoBiondo
said, you have great friends here, and we want to help you,
assist you in your mission. So we will help you any way we can
in that aspect, and also give--the needs of our individual
districts met as well.
Admiral Salerno. Yes, sir.
Mr. Cravaack. Admiral, also, since we're on this same page
here, being a naval aviator, one of the things I am concerned
about since 2008 we have had 15 operational casualties in the
Coast Guard. Many of those were due to aviation accidents. And
sir, I see you have a set of wings on your chest there, so I'm
sure it is near and dear to your heart, as well.
What do you believe is the cause for this unusually high
number of casualties over the past 2 years? And what are you
doing to address the problem? I have a feeling I know the
answer, but I just want to make sure.
Admiral Salerno. Sir, we will both take a stab at that,
because we both own part of that problem.
Sir, that was of great concern to the Coast Guard, to the
commandant personally, and to all of the senior leadership of
the Coast Guard. And Admiral Currier and I, in our respective
roles, chartered a study to examine the reasons why. We call it
the Aviation Safety Assessment Study. And it was a multifaceted
look not only going--questioning our own workforce, but also
benchmarking against external organizations on their safety
programs.
And what we found is there was a--some issues with rate of
change--cockpit configuration changes in a fairly short period
of time, the addition of new missions, the expectation that
pilots had to know more than maybe had been the case in the
past. And, quite honestly, some complacency.
This was a joint effort between our two organizations. But
as you point out, Admiral Currier is a senior aviator in the
Coast Guard. So I would like to maybe ask him to comment on
this, as well.
Mr. Cravaack. What did you fly, sir? I'm sorry, I don't
have a background on you.
Admiral Currier. Oh, I have--everything we have, except for
C-130s. Unfortunately, now I'm flying a desk. But I do keep
the----
Mr. Cravaack. I feel your pain, sir.
Admiral Currier. Sir, thanks for that question. When we
looked at 7 class A mishaps that--unfortunately, we lost 14
people in about a 30-month period, we looked at--we have a very
sophisticated system of analysis, mishap analysis, as you, as a
naval aviator, are well familiar.
What cooks out of an analysis like that are causal or
contributing factors. Those are the two things we look for.
When we scrubbed these seven mishaps, we found no intersection.
So, statistically, one could say it is not enough of an anomaly
to say it's significant, but we certainly thought it was
significant, losing 14 people.
What we were able to do is put together a multidimensional
study, of which we took personal ownership, and we surveyed our
entire workforce, and we came up with about five environmental
factors that contributed to a degradation in the safety posture
of the Coast Guard aviation. I personally have visited about
half of the air stations and another senior aviator has visited
the other half, to have a sit-down, across-the-table, eyeball-
to-eyeball talk with our aviators. And I think it has been very
successful, to date.
We have looked introspectively, identified some areas we
need to improve, and aggressively gotten after them. I think
this is a success story, as well, sir.
Mr. Cravaack. Thank you very much, once again, what you do.
And, Chairman, there will be a second round, sir? OK. Thank you
very much, sir, and I yield back.
Mr. LoBiondo. We will now turn to the gentleman from
coastal Louisiana----
Mr. Landry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. LoBiondo. What do we say, Loosiana, here?
Mr. Landry. Loosiana. I'm sure you will help them if they
can't understand me. Do a little interpretation for me.
Mr. LoBiondo. We will have the translator.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Landry. Admirals, you know, I've got to tell you. The
Coast Guard is one of the agencies in this Federal Government
that I think operates the way agencies should. However, I am
getting concerned that some of the other rotten apples in the
bunch are starting to spoil you all. So I am going to be a
little curt when it comes to these ice breakers that
Congressman Young was speaking about.
It frustrates me when we have 8 of our 10 largest ports in
this country under restrictions because we're not maintaining
them, and we are $14 trillion in debt, and we spent all this
money on stimulus that was supposed to stimulate jobs.
And it also frustrates me when we have equipment up in the
Arctic which is--which I consider another frontier kind of like
space. We have already shuttled the shuttle program. And we
need access to that area.
Now, when I was in business--because I come from the
business sector; I was never elected before I held this seat--I
leased things. And I didn't have to study something to
determine if I needed to lease it. It was simply a matter of
discussing with the stakeholders--with either the ship
builders, or those that would be interested in leasing it--and
running the numbers to determine whether or not the leasing is
more affordable than the purchasing.
And I can tell you that, when it comes to the Federal
Government, I don't know anything that it can own that the
private market can't provide more efficiently and more cost
effective. So please look into this. I think it is something
that we certainly need to do up there.
The second point which I came to discuss was the notice of
arrival. You know, we discussed this several times with you
all. We have exchanged a series of letters. We still--I think
we are at an impasse now. I would like you to tell me--or one
of you all to tell me--what you think that we could insert into
this--into the Coast Guard reauthorization bill, which will
help to break that impasse?
I mean why do we have to treat vessels that are leaving an
American port, just traveling out to the OCS and coming back to
an American port, the same way we treat a vessel coming from a
foreign port, you know, crossing the OCS, and coming into the
Gulf of Mexico? How can I help you so we can help the industry?
Admiral Salerno. Sir, as far as the impasse goes, we
actually do have a chartered effort undertaken with OMSA, the
Offshore Marine Services Association, to look at the best way
forward with this. In the interim, that provision in the
regulations is not being enforced. So currently, nobody is
being harmed by this. Absolutely understand the concerns that
you have raised in this and in other hearings, and in
consultation with you, you know, just a staff-to-staff basis.
So, we will continue to work with OMSA, and we would like
to develop recommendations through that effort. And then, sir,
we would love to convey those recommendations to you, and----
Mr. Landry. Well, and I appreciate it. Thank you all for
recognizing that, and thank you all for putting, basically, a
moratorium on the regulation right now.
My concern is what happens when you guys leave, and maybe
someone who is not as bright as you all takes your place, and
decides to start enforcing it? And so, what I would like to
do--again, I guess it's my business sense--when I see something
that is broke, I just want to fix it. You know, is there
something that we can do which helps give you--I guess to, I
guess, clarify the issue, whether it be classified--because I
know OMSA greatly appreciates your position currently, but they
still believe that there is some sort of impasse in moving
forward.
Admiral Salerno. Well, sir, I think we need to stay in
contact on this issue. I don't have the specific solution
today, but I do offer myself to be available to you as we work
through this problem.
Mr. Landry. Great. That will work. Just something that we
can do. I just want to help. Thank you so much.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. LoBiondo. Mr. Harris? Nothing? Mr. Larsen, do you have
another round?
Mr. Larsen. Dr. Bamford, you raised a concern in your
statement that several States are finding abandoned vessels,
bringing serious marine debris problems to the economic
downturn, an issue that has been highlighted, in fact, in my
district.
Do derelict vessels fall under the operational definition
of ``marine debris''?
Ms. Bamford. Yes, sir, they do.
Mr. Larsen. They do?
Ms. Bamford. They do fall under that definition that
currently is in promulgation.
Mr. Larsen. OK. So then who is legally responsible for
removing derelict vessels, once they become inoperable or an
environmental threat?
Ms. Bamford. Usually it falls on the State. We recently had
a--well, in 2009, due to continued questions and concerns about
derelict vessels, due to the economic downturn, we saw an
increase, or the States reported an increase.
We held a workshop with the Federal agencies, as well as
invited the 30 coastal States, as well as the Great Lakes--
Minnesota was there, as well--and we basically came to the
resolution, based on laws and regulations, that most of the
programs fall within the State requirements. So, States have
programs that either are funded through State authorizations,
or they develop programs to help in removal funds.
Where we come in is in helping multi-agency issues. For
example, one State wants to develop a program, and they are
looking for information. We tried to provide the best available
information for them to establish those programs.
Mr. Larsen. OK. On a related topic, then, for Admiral
Salerno, the Coast Guard is presently undertaking environmental
remediation and cleanup activities to remove the derelict barge
Davy Crockett from the Columbia River. Can you give us the
status of that cleanup effort? And will the Coast Guard be
pursuing reimbursement from the vessel's owner for these
expenses?
Admiral Salerno. Yes, sir. That is progressing. I know it
is nearing completion, but I don't have the exact status. I can
get that for you, for the record.
[The information follows:]

Currently, $19.55 million has been committed to the
case. The Davy Crockett response continues with effort
principally surrounding the removal and cleaning of
steel from the barge tanks. A Web site is being
maintained by the Unified Command tracking the current
progress of the removal, the site is available at:
http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/spills/incidents/
DavyCrockett/DavyCrockett.html.

Consistent with the Oil Pollution Act's ``polluter
pays'' principle, the Coast Guard's National Pollution
Fund Center recovers oil removal costs and damages from
liable polluters and any guarantors to the greatest
extent permitted by law. We have no comment on how
liability for oil removal costs and damages may
ultimately be enforced with respect to the Davy
Crockett incident. These are matters within the
enforcement discretion of the United States and pending
further investigation and close coordination among
affected agencies, including the Department of Justice.

But related to the broader question, this is an example
where an abandoned vessel also poses an environmental threat.
And when we have those types of situations, we can access the
oil spill liability trust fund, open a Federal project to
remove the pollution threat. In some cases, such as the Davy
Crockett case, to remove the threat you really need to remove
the vessel. So that is, functionally, what is happening there.
In all cases where we open up a Federal project under the
fund, we do seek recovery of the costs, Federal costs, from the
owner. That is fairly standard. And, of course, that always is
somewhat dependent on the owner's ability to pay, but we do
seek to recover.
Mr. Larsen. So you are seeking cost recovery because this
is a fund issue, oil spill fund----
Admiral Salerno. Yes. All of the Federal expenditures--and
also, if--I don't know all the details of the funding structure
for this case----
Mr. Larsen. Right, right.
Admiral Salerno [continuing]. But we can hire State
officials, as well, under the fund. Whatever expenditures are
charged against the fund we do seek to recover from the
responsible party.
Mr. Larsen. OK, thank you. Admiral Salerno, with regard to
fishing vessel examinations, the Coast Guard has estimated it
will need to hire no fewer than 60 full or part-time inspectors
to conduct examinations of roughly 30,000 fishing vessels by
the statutory deadline of October 2012.
How do you intend to address this requirement if the budget
provides less funding for rulemaking? And does the Coast Guard
intend to shift funds from other accounts in order to maintain
its rulemaking program?
Admiral Salerno. Sir, it will be challenging to complete
all of the fishing vessel examinations with our existing active
duty workforce. We would look to leverage some other
opportunities to help accomplish the requirements for the
examinations--for example, using our Coast Guard auxiliary, and
also leveraging some third-party capability.
If there are--if that does not satisfy the requirement, if
the workload is simply too great, then we would need to seek
additional resources. But we are not at that stage yet. We do
not plan to shift accounts, you know, specifically for that
purpose. Essentially, the burden would fall on our cadre of
marine inspectors that are currently in our workforce also
performing other vessel inspection activities.
Mr. Larsen. Would auxiliary or a third party have authority
to ultimately sign off on the examination?
Admiral Salerno. The--some of those details, sir, have to
be worked out. We did have a legal matter which is being
resolved regarding the use of the auxiliary, for example. As
you know, they are not allowed to engage in law enforcement
activity. So pending is a decision whether we can use them to
sign off, or just simply as an assistant for a Coast Guard
officer or petty officer.
But we--they at least provide a force that can be used to
help streamline the inspection when we do that.
Mr. Larsen. Should we expect that the Coast Guard is going
to ask for a push back of the October 2012 timeline?
Admiral Salerno. Sir, I don't know if we have asked for
that. I would have to get back to you on that.
Mr. Larsen. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. LoBiondo. Mr. Cravaack?
Mr. Cravaack. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Bamford, I have
had the great opportunity, as a Reservist, to be attached to a
command that was attached to Midway Island. And I have walked
Midway Island's beaches. And I know that this is just--debris
is not just a United States problem, it is a global problem,
and it gets washed up on the beaches.
Can you tell me, in your analysis of the--I'm assuming you
did an analysis of the debris that was on our beaches--how much
is--you know, comes from the United States versus other
countries?
Ms. Bamford. That's a great question, and one that is
extremely hard to answer.
It depends. When you look at Midway, you're absolutely
right. A lot of that debris is mixed, it's from international
origin, as well as from U.S. The majority of what we see there
is international in origin. It's a lot of fishing gear. We have
actually found debris out there from World War II, material
that we find from an old sailor's vest. And so you see that
this stuff actually exists out in the ocean for decades. It
gets caught up in the convergence zones and then deposits
itself on Midway.
When you actually look at around our coast here on the East
Coast and West Coast, you see a lot more debris coming from the
United States, obviously. It's a lot of waste, commercial
waste, plastic debris, bags, things like that, that come from
the U.S. And we see that after storms, coming out of storm
drains. It is basically a waste management issue that we see
here.
So, in order to tackle both of those, we have to look at
marine debris as a ubiquitous problem. It knows no
international or State boundaries. So we try to develop
programs that address both domestic, as well as foreign,
debris.
Mr. Cravaack. Ma'am, could you tell me, are the other
international communities involved with this, as well? I mean
is it just the United States bearing the brunt of all this?
Ms. Bamford. Yes, sir, they are. We just had an
international conference. The Fifth International Marine Debris
Conference was recently held in Hawaii. We had over--close to
400 participants from 30 international countries. And we just
started those conversations again, because the previous
international marine debris conference was a decade ago, 10
years ago, and NOAA, with UNEP, cosponsored this one we just
had, and it really started those conversations in developing
strategies on an international forum.
So, those engagements have been re-energized, and the
outcome from that particular conference is continuing on today
through strategies and programs that are being developed.
Mr. Cravaack. OK. Thank you, ma'am. The--according--my
understanding is the Marine Debris Research, Prevention, and
Reduction Act authorized--was it $2 million--through fiscal
year 2010 for the Coast Guard to enforce requirements which
prohibits at-sea discharge of plastic trash and vessels.
Of the $2 million authorized, how much has been spent on
this program? I don't know if the Coast Guard would answer
that, or you would answer that, ma'am.
Ms. Bamford. I will defer to the Coast Guard.
Mr. Cravaack. Thank you, ma'am.
Admiral Salerno. Sir, there was no money specifically
appropriated to the Coast Guard for that. However, we have been
working in very close partnership with NOAA on the marine
debris program. And that has taken a number of different forms.
Probably the most dominant is our--we have blended in
enforcement of the MARPOL Annex V into our normal ports that
control examinations, so that 9,000 or so international vessels
that call at the United States every year are examined by the
Coast Guard for a number of things, including compliance with
the international treaties on--to prevent discharge of garbage
at sea.
We also make sure that any facility that receives an
international vessel or domestic vessel has the capability to
receive garbage, so that there is a place for it to go, other
than into the ocean.
We have used our own ships as available. You know, for some
of the activities that were mentioned by Congressman Farr--for
example, out in the Pacific doing cleanups, working with NOAA,
with the Army, recovering abandoned nets and so forth, and
bringing quite a bit of it back--and also we have engaged with
our sea partners program, with the public, with school
children, with recreational boaters, again, just sensitizing
them to the need to put trash in its proper place.
Mr. Cravaack. Thank you, sir. Appreciate that.
Dr. Bamford, again, we have talked a little bit about the
West Coast, we have talked about the Gulf. But near and dear to
my heart is Great Lakes. Can you just comment a little bit
about the Great Lakes?
Ms. Bamford. Yes, sir. The program recently expanded our
regional coordinator into the Great Lakes. The majority of what
we see up there in terms of a problem is a lot of the plastic
debris, and the papers and the bags.
The ocean conservancy, we partner with them in the
International Coastal Cleanup, and they have a very strong and
a very good presence up in the Great Lakes.
The--also the issue of abandoned vessels is a problem
outside navigable waterways, and we see that and we try to work
with that in developing programs with the States. But we have,
as a program, just recently--that was our latest coordinator,
due to the need in the Great Lakes for a Federal presence to
support the States in marine debris reduction efforts.
Mr. Cravaack. Thank you, Doctor. And with that, Mr.
Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. LoBiondo. OK. Thank you. You still good, Andy? OK.
Thank you very much. Just one kind of last thing. Admiral
Salerno, you noted that you had become the DCO and Admiral
Currier has become the DCMS. Congratulations to both of you.
Good luck.
The question is, will the Atlantic and Pacific area
commanders remain in those positions, or are they slated to
become deputy commandants or commanders of operation for the
command and for force of command?
Admiral Salerno. Sir, they will remain as Atlantic area and
Pacific area, respectively.
Mr. LoBiondo. OK. Admiral Currier, Admiral Salerno, Dr.
Bamford, thank you very much for your testimony.
The committee meeting is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:17 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
