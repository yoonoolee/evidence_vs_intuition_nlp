IMPROVING AND STREAMLINING THE COAST
GUARD'S ACQUISITION PROGRAM

----------

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 13, 2011

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Coast Guard and
Maritime Transportation,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:00 a.m., in
Room 2167, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Frank LoBiondo
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. LoBiondo. Good morning. The subcommittee will come to
order.
The subcommittee is meeting this morning to examine the
status of the Coast Guard's acquisition programs. In 2002, the
Coast Guard signed the contract to begin the acquisition of the
program formally known as the Integrated Deepwater System.
Deepwater was supposed to provide a complete recapitalization
and modernization of the Service's larger aging assets as well
as an outdated communications and information system over a 20-
year period. Well, at least that is what we were promised.
Now, nearly a decade later, the Service has less to show
for their investment of over $7 billion in taxpayer money than
it should. Although there has been some added capability with a
few recapitalized assets delivered to date, the fact remains we
are not where we should be. In fact, I don't even think we are
close. The program remains significantly over budget and
several years behind schedule.
In addition, serious questions remain about whether the
assets being delivered meet expected capabilities. I will
remind everyone, this was a big selling point with Deepwater,
the capabilities aspect of this. The delays in the
recapitalization program have put a tremendous strain on legacy
assets which has resulted in increased operating costs, a
rising number of operational failures, and large gaps in
mission readiness and performance.
One of the many examples of these problems is the National
Security Cutter. To date, the Service has taken delivery of two
National Security Cutters. Both vessels represent tremendous
improvements over the 45-year-old vessels they are replacing.
However, the program is currently 2 years behind schedule and
38 percent over the revised 2007 budget. In addition, both
vessels will require substantial retrofits to meet expected
service lives. That one is really hard for me to understand and
accept.
Furthermore, both vessels were designed to carry two
classes of stern-launched small boats, each with different size
and capability to improve the cutter's range and effectiveness.
That was viewed as a very good thing. The larger of the two
boats did not perform as required and the smaller boat had to
be modified to perform correctly. The Service recently
solicited industry for a solution to replace both classes of
small boats. Meanwhile, the two NSCs operate without expected
capabilities. You just don't expect that from new assets, I am
sorry.
The NSC was also designed to carry up to four vertical
takeoff unmanned aerial vehicles to extend the cutter's range
and effectiveness, but neither vessel is outfitted with the
VUAVs. In fact, the Coast Guard abandoned its original plans to
acquire VUAVs.
Finally, the NSC was intended to operate for 225 days at
sea, but the Coast Guard has yet to implement the crewing plan
to make that a reality.
As the chart on the screen indicates, the NSC is not alone
in suffering from setbacks. Using the Coast Guard's 2007 re-
baseline as a guide, of the Coast Guard's 17 large acquisition
programs, 10 are over budget, 8 are behind schedule, 6 are both
over budget and behind schedule. If we use the original
Deepwater baseline as a guide, nearly all of these programs
would be over budget and behind schedule.
For the information of Members, the chart on the screen
primarily uses the Service's 2007 re-baseline as a point of
comparison.
The Service recently completed another effort to review the
types and numbers of assets needed to meet mission
requirements. This subcommittee has repeatedly requested this
document--I reiterate, has repeatedly requested this document--
because it has the potential to significantly increase costs
and further delay asset deliveries. Unfortunately, the Service
refused to provide it to us.
Let that sink in for a minute.
Meanwhile, delays in the Coast Guard's recapitalization
program have placed significant strains on legacy assets. The
continued reliance on these assets, which have surpassed their
planned service lives, are failing at increasing rates, has
undermined mission readiness and performance. The Service
estimates a 23,000 mission hour gap exists in the maritime
patrol aircraft fleet, a 33,000 hour mission gap in the major
cutter fleet, and a 103,000 hour mission gap in the patrol boat
fleet. Furthermore, the cost to maintain legacy assets
continues to grow at the expense of investment in new assets in
what Admiral Allen used to call a ``death spiral.''
Finally, in order to pay for the Deepwater program, several
sacrifices were made in the budgets of other critical
acquisitions. As a result, the rehabilitation of dilapidated
housing for our service men and women has been put off and
needed investment in buoy tender and icebreaker fleets have
been delayed. In fact, the Coast Guard has at least eight
classes of assets where the need for an acquisition program can
clearly be demonstrated, but no acquisition plan or budget even
exists.
The Coast Guard leadership we have here today was not here
10 years ago and is not responsible for the past problems. We
understand that. But I was here 10 years ago and I know what we
were promised, and this is not it. And this is the biggest
group of cheerleaders that you are going to have in the
Congress of the United States that you are before here today,
and all this that I am talking about that is going on is going
to be absorbed by Members who are not paying the attention that
we are, and it is not leading to a good thing.
The Coast Guard has made great strides to turn the program
around in recent years, and I commend them for that. But now it
is time to deliver results for the taxpayer, and in particular
for the men and women of the Coast Guard, who desperately need
these assets to successfully conduct their missions.
I hope, I sincerely hope our witnesses will explain what
the Service intends to do to mitigate legacy asset failures and
short side infrastructure backlogs while ensuring the upgraded
assets and technology set to be delivered in the future meet
the mission need requirements and come in on budget and on
time.
With that, I would like to yield to Mr. Larsen.
Mr. Larsen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for
convening this morning's hearing to continue the subcommittee's
oversight of the U.S. Coast Guard's major acquisition programs
and policies. I appreciate the opportunity to examine the
status of the Coast Guard's acquisition activities and to
assess current acquisition management challenges.
The Coast Guard is a multimission agency with a diverse
portfolio of operations, including vessel inspections, search
and rescue, port security, and oil spill response. In short,
our Nation's guardian of the sea protects our coasts, ensures
safe and efficient maritime commerce, and supports hundreds of
thousands of maritime jobs.
So when the Coast Guard began recapitalizing in 1996, it
set out a daunting task. The Coast Guard intended to replace or
modernize its aging fleet of over 90 cutters and some 200
aircraft, and it attempted to do so through an unproven
procurement process using a single entity to fulfill its needs.
By the time the Deepwater contract was executed with the
integrated Coast Guard systems in June 2002, GAO and others had
already raised concerns. As was made painfully clear during a
course of subcommittee oversight hearings on this issue during
the 110th and 111th Congresses, the Coast Guard's past
oversight and management of its major system acquisition,
especially of the $27 billion Deepwater program which was to
procure these entirely new fleets of vessels and aircraft, was
woefully insufficient and ineffective.
Regrettably, the Service's inadequate oversight at the time
led to substantial cost overruns, design flaws, delays in
delivery of new assets, and perhaps worst of all, a diminution
of the Coast Guard's operational capabilities at sea and in the
air. The GAO reaffirmed this determination through multiple
analyses. GAO has conducted no fewer than 15 audits and
evaluations of the Deepwater program since 2001.
So I look forward to hearing this morning from John Hutton,
GAO's Director for Acquisitions and Management, as the GAO
releases its latest update on the Coast Guard's progress in
reforming this acquisition process.
To provide the necessary course correction, the Congress
included in title IV of last year's Coast Guard reauthorization
legislation specific provisions to overhaul the Service's
acquisition policies. New requirements were the appointment of
a chief acquisition officer; imposition of a system of
acquisition controls to ensure that operational requirements
are well defined before initiating acquisition efforts; new
requirements to ensure all required assets undergo thorough
testing; and the development and maintenance of an acquisition
and management career path within the Service. So I am very
interested in hearing from Admiral Currier on the Coast Guard's
progress in implementing these reforms.
Mr. Chairman, acquisition policy is not just a function of
the process. Our policies are also reflected in budgetary
resources we devote to programs. At our budget oversight
hearing on March 1st we heard a lot about doing more with less.
However, I believe that we have established that the more
likely outcome of fewer resources for the Coast Guard is that
it will be doing less with less.
While recent budget cuts have largely spared the Coast
Guard, the massive cuts in discretionary spending in the budget
resolution presented to the House and due on the floor Friday
do not portend full funding of the Coast Guard's asset
replacement program.
The Coast Guard's acquisition, construction and improvement
account average was $1.38 billion from fiscal year 2007 through
the request for 2012. However, the Coast Guard's projected
funding for fiscal years 2013 through 2016 average $1.9 billion
annually, a $520 million annual increase. This level greatly
exceeds any historical levels and will likely need to be
adjusted down unless Congress makes other choices.
We are past the time when we can discuss cuts in the
abstract. Proposed cuts will have consequences. Can the Coast
Guard respond to oil and other spills? Can it respond to a
tsunami on the West Coast? Can it perform all the missions we
placed upon it?
So I look forward to working with Admiral Currier and the
Coast Guard in assessing the real impacts of possible cuts.
The subcommittee also, Mr. Chairman, I think should not
overlook the critical importance of other ongoing Coast Guard
acquisition programs, such as Rescue 21, the Service's
sustainment programs for legacy assets that remain in service,
and several unbudgeted acquisition needs, including the need,
Mr. Chairman, not surprisingly hearing it from me, the need for
polar icebreakers.
It remains paramount that the subcommittee, the GAO and
other observers continue to shine a light on the Coast Guard as
we move forward to ensure that its acquisition programs are
mission driven, cost-effective, and, most importantly, as you
have pointed out so ably, Mr. Chairman, accountable.
Mr. Chairman, the Coast Guard and the men and women who
serve need the capabilities to address the myriad of demands we
place upon them. But as you noted, we need to get this right.
History demonstrates the Coast Guard will be relying on the
assets it purchases today for many more years than anticipated.
We also need to be practical and recognize that a course
correction of this magnitude simply does not happen overnight.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back and look forward to
our witnesses.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you, Mr. Larsen.
Ms. Hirono, do you have a statement?
Ms. Hirono. Very briefly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
Ranking Member Larsen.
I join my colleagues in reiterating our support for the
Coast Guard. In Hawaii, particularly District 14, is the
largest area that the Coast Guard has responsibility for. I
know that members of District 14 were involved in helping with
tsunami disaster relief in Japan and you were involved in the
Deepwater disaster. So we know the good works that you do. But
this committee is also very aware of the acquisition problems
that you have had, and I sat in on hearings of the full
committee regarding your Deepwater project problems.
So, as we look at the scarce resources and the cuts that
are coming down the pike, I really want to reiterate my support
for what you are doing. We need to be assured of the
accountability and the effectiveness of the operations that you
are undertaking with the resources that you have and the
reforms you have made, what you are implementing and putting in
place to make sure you are able to do as good a job as possible
for all the demands made only your service.
Thank you.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you.
Our witnesses today include Coast Guard Vice Admiral John
Currier, the Deputy Commandant for Mission Support, and Mr.
John P. Hutton, Director of Acquisition and Sourcing Management
for the GAO.
I also would like to thank Admirals Atkins, Taylor and
Rabago, who lead the Coast Guard's Capabilities, Budget and
Acquisition Directorates for attending today. I would like to
welcome our witnesses and thank them for being here.
Admiral Currier, please proceed.

TESTIMONY OF VICE ADMIRAL JOHN P. CURRIER, DEPUTY COMMANDANT
FOR MISSION SUPPORT, U.S. COAST GUARD; AND JOHN P. HUTTON,
DIRECTOR OF ACQUISITION AND SOURCING MANAGEMENT, GOVERNMENT
ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE

Admiral Currier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman LoBiondo, Ranking Member Larsen and members of the
subcommittee, I thank you for the opportunity to update you
today on Coast Guard acquisition programs and the outlook of
our ongoing and much needed recapitalization portfolio. I have
prepared a full written statement and ask for its inclusion in
the record, sir.
Mr. LoBiondo. Without objection, so ordered.
Admiral Currier. Thank you.
In recent years, the Coast Guard has made noteworthy
improvements in the acquisition program. The creation of the
Deputy Commandant for Mission Support, assumption of systems
integrator responsibilities for all major acquisition programs,
creation of a disciplined capabilities development and the
strengthened oversight by Coast Guard technical authorities
better positions the Service to manage its acquisitions with
greater efficiency and be prepared to make tough trade-offs
when it is due in the challenging fiscal environment that we
face today.
These changes would not have been possible without the
leadership and effective oversight of this subcommittee through
the enactment of the Coast Guard authorization bill of 2010.
This act, built on several initiatives that we had started in
the Coast Guard and sought to implement, provided us with
critical new authorities to strengthen our acquisition
workforce.
In my new role as Deputy Commandant for Mission Support,
formerly Chief of Staff, I would also like to take this
opportunity to personally thank you for your contributions,
continued support and oversight.
The Commandant and the administration consider
recapitalization one of our service's highest priorities. The
administration recognizes the urgent need by proposing the
largest AC&I request in Coast Guard history. However, the
deteriorating state of our legacy cutters, aircraft, boats and
shore facilities are impacting the ability of our men and women
in the field to achieve mission success.
We find ourselves in a state of block obsolescence, with
many of our assets, including aircraft and vessels,
simultaneously reaching the end of their service lives. Our
aging legacy fleet is both increasingly unreliable and
increasingly expensive to maintain effectively. We need to
replace these ships and aircraft as soon as possible. Our
acquisition program is designed to provide these necessary
assets and capabilities at the best value to the American
taxpayer.
Despite the opportunities and challenges that we continue
to face, the Coast Guard is achieving mission success right now
with our newly delivered assets, our capabilities and our
infrastructure. The National Security Cutters Bertholf and
Waesche are operational today. Bertholf recently interdicted
more than 12,500 kilograms of cocaine. Her commanding officer
reported that Bertholf easily prosecuted and tracked multiple
targets, including go-fast boats, using the cutter's full
electronic suite of sensors and communications gear. They were
able to coordinate small boat, maritime patrol aircraft and
helicopter end game tactics to achieve mission success.
Air Station Miami, the HC-144 maritime patrol aircraft, or
MPA, successfully identified and helped interdict two vessels
attempting to smuggle drugs into the U.S. and accomplished one
search and rescue mission in a single 14-hour patrol, something
that we would never have been able to oh do with our previous
assets.
A response boat medium stationed in San Juan was recently
credited with intercepting 95 bales of cocaine. These boats are
providing thousands of hours of effective search and rescue and
port security operations around the Nation.
Our Rescue 21 program has resulted in over 200 lives saved
in 28,000 rescue missions due to its enhanced capabilities.
We are planning to launch the Fast Response Cutter this
month. The project is on budget, and the fiscal year budget
request contains a request for six more of these vessels in a
fixed price environment.
Our general transition to fixed price contract structures
represent itself growing maturity in the stability of our
acquisition programs the Coast Guard has awarded directly to
prime contractors for the National Security Cutter, maritime
patrol aircraft and other assets in our relationship with ICGS
as it ends and we closely integrate our technical authorities
at all stages of the acquisition and sustainment process.
All of our acquisition project managers are certified
currently at the highest levels of DHS certification levels.
These actions have enabled the Coast Guard to generate more
predictable costs and stabilized requirements at decreased risk
to the government.
We are faced with many challenges, managing a multiyear,
multibillion-dollar acquisition portfolio in today's
constrained fiscal environment. At the same time, our legacy
asset fleet is expensive to maintain and less reliable to
operate.
Our program of record represents a mix of assets necessary
to carry out our statutory missions. We are replacing a larger
number of legacy assets with fewer, more capable aircraft and
cutters. We have put in place a program of rigorous and ongoing
analysis of Coast Guard mission requirements to define our
acquisition needs. We are constantly making trade-offs to
better balance our performance and will continue to do so in
the future.
The fiscal year 2012 budget request and the capital
investment plan represent our service priorities and reflect
our commitment to the Department and the administration
rebuilding the Coast Guard.
We are acquiring an enduring versatile capability in this
fleet that will protect American lives, property and resources
over the next several decades. The Coast Guard is 5 years into
a long journey to rebuild its acquisition enterprise, integrate
mission support, introduce rigor into requirements generation,
and strengthen our capabilities in contracting to create a
regime where costs are predictable, program risk is identified
and schedules are met.
I can attest today that we have begun to demonstrate marked
return on investments as we recapitalize the Coast Guard. I
look forward to further discussing these endeavors and stand
ready to answer any questions you may have.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you, Admiral.
Mr. Hutton, please.
Mr. Hutton. Thank you, Chairman.
Chairman LoBiondo, Ranking Member Larsen and members of the
subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to discuss the Coast
Guard's efforts to improve its management of its major
acquisition programs.
Drawing from our new report that we released today, I will
highlight some of the Coast Guard's recent efforts to improve
its acquisition management as well as some of the program
challenges. Then, based on some ongoing work, I will provide an
update on the Coast Guard's efforts to address a recommendation
we made last year for them to complete an analysis that
clarifies the quantities, mix, and costs of Deepwater assets
considering the fiscal constraints.
The Coast Guard continues to take steps to improve its
acquisition management. Specifically, the Coast Guard has
updated its policies and processes, increased its in-house
acquisition workforce capacity, leveraged DOD agreements to
support its major acquisition programs, and to further leverage
DOD expertise, we recommend in today's report that the Coast
Guard take some additional steps to help better ensure that its
program staffs have ready access to the 80-plus interagency
agreements and other arrangements with DOD.
Now, while the steps the Coast Guard continues to take are
positive, most major programs experience some challenges in
program execution, resources and/or schedule. The report we are
issuing today covers these challenges in more detail. However,
I would like to focus on one particular challenge, and that is
unrealistic budget planning, which has contributed to program
breaches and will likely lead to future breaches.
When a current 5-year capital investment plan reflects
funding levels that are significantly lower than initially
planned, that program is prone to fall behind. In fact, several
major acquisition programs reported a baseline breach due at
least in part to funding profile changes resulting from the
2011 capital investment plan. More breaches may occur if the
Coast Guard continues to conduct long-term planning based on
funding levels that are much higher than past appropriated or
requested levels.
For example, the Coast Guard plans on $2.35 billion in
acquisition funding in fiscal year 2015. That is an amount that
will include construction of three major surface assets, the
National Security Cutter, the Offshore Patrol Cutter and the
Fast Response Cutter. But the Coast Guard has not received more
than $1.5 billion for its acquisitions in any recent year, and
with the rapidly building fiscal pressures facing our
government, this unrealistic budget planning exacerbates the
challenges the Coast Guard programs face.
To its credit, the Coast Guard has acknowledged that it
needs to establish some priorities among their major programs
and make these trade-offs between programs to ensure that the
budget planning fits with historical budget constraints. The
key will be whether and how the Coast Guard makes such trade-
offs.
This is a key moment in time, and it is important that the
Coast Guard does not push trade-off decisions to tomorrow.
This, of course, brings me to my last point, the Coast Guard's
Deepwater fleet mix analysis, which began in October 2008, and
our July 2010 recommendation that the Coast Guard assess their
costs, capabilities and quantity trade-offs within the
Deepwater program in light of the program cost increases.
Last July, we reported that the Coast Guard initiated a
second phase of its fleet mix analysis because the first phase,
which was completed in December 2009, was not cost constrained.
Since that time, we received and have been reviewing the phase
one analysis and continue to do so.
The first phase assessed asset capabilities and mission
demands to identify a fleet mix that would help meet the Coast
Guard's long-term mission performance goals. The result was
what the Coast Guard termed an objective fleet that was about
twice the size of the current Deepwater program of record, and
the analysis indicated, and this is a Coast Guard analysis, an
estimated acquisition cost of as much as $65 billion. The
analysis also assessed other fleet mixes that fell between the
program of record as indicated in the current 2007 DHS-approved
baseline and the objective fleet, but did not consider any
fleet mixes smaller than the baseline program.
While the second phase of the analysis includes cost
constraints, they appear to be unrealistic given the level of
past appropriations and the current fiscal challenges facing
our Nation. The upper bound is about $1.7 billion per year.
That is more than Congress has enacted for the entire Coast
Guard's acquisition portfolio in recent years. More
importantly, we understand that the Coast Guard does not plan
to assess any fleet mixes smaller than the program of record, a
step that would help them better prepare for and make any
tradeoff decisions, given our Nation's fiscally constrained
environment.
Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement. I would
be happy to respond to any questions you have.
Mr. LoBiondo. OK. I thank you.
Mr. Hutton, if any of us are oblivious to the pressures,
the budget pressures and the fiscal crisis we are in, I don't
know where you have been, so most of the people in here
understand it. But what do you consider the greatest risk if
the Coast Guard doesn't get their act together?
Mr. Hutton. Well, first of all, as we have noted, I think
one of the important things is that you want to have a program
that the acquisition directorate can execute. To do that, you
have to make sure that your planned resources are going to
marry up with the acquisition strategy. If you don't have that,
you are going to have situations where every year you start
changing your programs to compensate for this unrealistic
planning. I think that is a big part of trying to address this
issue. I think it is a good thing that they are doing their
fleet mix analyses. It is a continuous effort, I believe, on
their part.
What we have been talking about here though is in the
current fiscal constraints, it seems reasonable that you would
also consider some of the trade-offs and scenarios if you don't
get the money you need, so you can start looking ahead and
thinking how you will react.
As Admiral Currier mentioned, he said it is very expensive
to keep the legacy fleet operating, and you have to constantly
make those trades between sustaining the old and acquiring the
new. And I think the budget and the connection with the
acquisition strategy is a key component of that.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you.
Admiral Currier, Chairman Mica and I requested the fleet
mix analysis 14 months ago and we still haven't received it. At
our hearing last month, Admiral Papp promised us he would
provide a timetable on when we would receive the document. We
have not received the timetable.
When will we receive the cost constrained fleet mix
analysis?
Admiral Currier. Thank you for that question, Mr. Chairman.
The phase one of the fleet mix analysis that was just
mentioned by Mr. Hutton, which is basically a survey from a
threshold to an objective of what our fleet could be, and
supports, by the way, the program of record, has been submitted
to the Department for review. Phase two of that will be
completed this summer. Phase two is the overlay that gives the
costed aspects of the fleet so that we can develop a more
complete picture of what our needs might be.
But I want to reiterate, fleet mix analysis number one,
much of the data of which is in the GAO report that was
delivered today, shows a threshold which is the program of
record out to an objective which expands the Coast Guard asset
base to more completely satisfy the 11 statutory missions that
we are charged with.
Specifically to your point, fleet mix analysis one is in
review at the Department. We are using all of our capabilities
to ensure that it is expeditiously reviewed and that it is
provided to you, sir. I am unable to do that directly at this
time.
Fleet mission analysis two, phase two costed, will be
completed this summer and submitted this summer to the
Department for review as a complete package.
Mr. LoBiondo. Well, thank you, and I appreciate that. But
here is a little tip: When a request is made and 14 months go
by and we really don't hear anything, this is not a good thing.
And when the Commandant makes a statement and we still don't
have what the Commandant told us we would get, that is a
problem. So there needs to be at the very least an improved
level of communications so that we can understand what you are
doing or why we are not getting something. We are trying not to
be unreasonable here, but from our perspective, we are your
biggest cheerleaders, it appears we are being ignored.
A couple more questions before I turn it over to Mr.
Larsen. Assuming the fiscal year 2011 appropriations become
available as we expect they will be at the end of this week,
when will the Coast Guard sign a contract for NSC number 5?
Admiral Currier. Sir, if the appropriation is approved and
we receive the money, we could award the contract for NSC 5,
the production contract for NSC 5, in the fourth quarter this
summer, the fourth quarter of the fiscal year this summer, late
in the summer. We have the proposal in hand and we have already
started close review.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you. The NSC was designed and built to
carry out as many as four vertical takeoff and unmanned aerial
vehicles. We talked about that. It was expected to extend the
range and effectiveness. We talked about that. A variety of
other things it was designed to replace and enhance the
capabilities.
How do you justify the cost of the National Security Cutter
if, according to the Inspector General, it is only providing a
similar level of capability as the vessel it is replacing?
Admiral Currier. Thank you for that question, sir.
Plain talk, National Security Cutter is much more capable
in its current state than the High Endurance Cutter ever was.
Its ability to carry an H-60 aircraft plus H-65s, its ability
to carry two H-65 aircraft when required, its electronics
detection suite, its radars, all of its detection and
electronics suite, make this ship much more effective, much
more effective than the current assets that we have.
We won't achieve full potential of this ship until we get
unmanned aerial vehicles in a proper regime of maritime patrol
overhead to maximize the capabilities of the ship. But
currently, as it sits in the water, it is significantly more
capable than the High Endurance Cutters that we have today.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you, Admiral.
Mr. Larsen.
Mr. Larsen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Rather than jump to a
different issue, I will just stick with the theme on this
particular issue, the security cutter, and the unmanned
vertical aerial vehicles.
What is the status of the effort to develop one and how is
the Coast Guard collaborating with the DOD to adapt already
proven technology for the Coast Guard's own use?
Admiral Currier. Sir, I will give you just a bit of history
on this thing. The unmanned aerial vehicle, we originally
entered an endeavor through our commercial systems integrator
that we previously had a contract relationship with. We didn't
see this as coming to fruition. It was leading science, it was
expensive and it was high risk.
We changed our philosophy, our approach to this, and went
with DOD. The Coast Guard is a midsized Federal agency and is
very capable, but it has no business leading science in
something as complex as unmanned aerial vehicles, particularly
rotary wing.
We have partnered closely with the Naval Air Systems
Command. As a matter of fact, I had a discussion yesterday with
its Commander, talking about our partnership on unmanned aerial
vehicles. We are closely watching their Fire Scout Program. We
think when they bring that home, that will satisfy many of our
mission requirements and be a great fit for the National
Security Cutter.
But, as I said before, to manage costs, manage risks with
this leading of science type enterprise, we chose to change
directions and closely ally with Navy through Naval Air
Systems.
Mr. Larsen. I don't mind that you changed direction to
partner with the Navy. I am just interested in the status. As
you have noted, having the capability of the National Security
Cutter to the extent that we want it likely would include
having the ability to have the unmanned aerial vehicle. So
getting to that point is important. I need to move on.
This issue with regards to the ACI account and the
projected budget, what you have projected, versus what
historically you have received, that is troubling to me because
it tells me that a man's reach should exceed his grasp. Robert
Frost, right? But you have never been able to grab it in the
budget. So how is the Coast Guard going to approach that?
Admiral Currier. Well, sir, first of all, we are caught in
a difficult position, recapitalizing the entire asset base of
the Service, our major assets in the Service. We are looking at
a two to three decade recapitalization process, the life cycles
of these assets. They are all coming due at the same time. And
as the Chairman mentioned, you don't need to hear from me what
an austere fiscal environment this is.
But our requirements are our requirements. We have to
budget to the minimum level that we feel we can achieve that
will allow us to continue this recapitalization, because if we
don't do it in an expeditious manner, one of the maxims of
acquisition is delays equal cost. So if we are not aggressive
about pushing forward with this recapitalization, we can only
expect more expensive legacy assets and more expensive new
assets because of the delays that were incurred.
I understand the tensions here. I understand that we are
asking more than we have gotten before. But I believe, sir,
that we have proved our value to the Nation, and it is really
up to Congress and the will of the people if they are willing
to make that investment in their Coast Guard. I think it is
justified.
Mr. Larsen. Does the fleet analysis include an analysis of
your sustainment budgets as well and how those fit into your
legacy assets to be sure those can continue while you get to
the point where you are actually putting new assets online?
Admiral Currier. Sir, I believe the fleet mix analysis is
forward looking. I think it defines requirements for fleet mix
of the future. There may be some mention in the phase two of
this, in the costed portion of the cost of legacy assets and
the offset of the new assets. But its focus is forward looking.
Mr. Larsen. Well, let me ask then retrospectively how you
are thinking about your sustainment budget to the extent you
discuss block obsolescence. Does that sustainment budget,
sustainment approach you are taking, does it anticipate that
you are going to be shedding assets? You are prioritizing
within your legacy assets as well, I assume, putting
sustainment dollars into things that you think can stretch out.
Admiral Currier. Absolutely. Yes, sir. And to be truthful,
as we bring these major new assets on board, it is unrealistic
for us to expect to maintain a constant level of service
because of the requirement to retire legacy assets. This would
be just like buying a new car and holding the old car so that
you never miss anything. It just doesn't work that way.
We are going to have gaps in operational capability, full
well knowing that we are going from a fleet of 44 major cutters
to 33 major cutters. But we feel that with the asset base as
laid down and as designed to be employed, that we will be
better off. We will actually enhance our capabilities into the
future. There will be a dip in operational effectiveness and
capability and operational hours though as we transition.
Mr. Larsen. Mr. Chairman, I will have more questions.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you. Ms. Hirono.
Ms. Hirono. Thank you. Admiral, I am very gratified that
the 14th District will be receiving four new helicopters to
replace aging ones. That is really good news. On the other
hand, I am sure that there are a lot of other places that are
waiting, clearly from your testimony, for replacing aging
assets.
So I am wondering, in your testimony you noted that you
have established a senior level governance body known as an
Executive Oversight Council. Is this the entity that determined
that the 14th District should get the four helicopters? Is this
council working to use your assets in the best way possible?
Admiral Currier. Well, ma'am, thank you for that question.
I think I will answer it in two quick very brief ways.
First of all, our operational force layout is determined by
our operational commanders in concert with that Executive
Oversight Council through our Capabilities Directorate headed
by Admiral Atkins here today. So that is an operational
question of where the assets go.
How the assets are recapitalized is certainly the purview
of the Executive Oversight Committee, and that body I am
particularly proud of. For the first time, it integrates the
supporters, the acquirers, the requirers and the resource
people into a body where discussions are held on capabilities,
costs and technical achievability, a great step forward for the
Coast Guard.
So thanks for the question. Hopefully that provides you an
answer.
Ms. Hirono. Well, it is pretty clear that the retiring of
the legacy assets and replacement of these assets with new
assets, that the new assets have to be able to do a lot more,
the technology involved has to be vastly improved. So who
oversees your contractors or whoever is coming up with the
designs for you to approve so that your capacity and capability
is increased even as you have fewer numerical assets?
Admiral Currier. Well, the design is--first of all, our
requirements are mandated. We come up with the requirements. We
go out to industry for design. They have to meet those
requirements. That is where the technology refresh happens. The
governance of that process is this Executive Oversight Council.
But it is a normal acquisition process on how we upgrade. It
meets our concept of operations, our requirements, the
attributes we get from industry when we put out a proposal, and
all of that is governed through the headquarters Executive
Oversight Council.
Ms. Hirono. Is that oversight council working a lot better
than the times that you have regarding your Deepwater project
and all of the overruns and problems you have with that? Is
this council doing what it needs to do to prevent the kind of
problems you have with your Deepwater project?
Admiral Currier. Yes, it is, Congresswoman. I was part of
acquisitions back in 2006 and was one of the architects of what
is now our transformation into the new acquisition enterprise,
which, by the way, just isn't acquisition. It integrates
support, technical authority, resources and requirers on one
group for the first time. I think this is a model for
government. I think we are on the cusp at this time of showing
true return on investment through the processes that we have
put in place as we continue the recapitalization of the Coast
Guard.
Ms. Hirono. One last question. Mr. Hutton, you have heard
the Admiral talk about this council and some of the processes
that they have put in place to enable them to do a much better
job. Are you in agreement that these are important and
significant steps?
Mr. Hutton. Specific to the council, I would agree that
that is the first time, as the Admiral stated, where they are
trying to bring the logistics and the requirements people
together and the acquisition people and the resource people,
and if the thorny issues are brought up to that council in a
transparent way and are discussed, then you have the
opportunity to make good decisions. But it always comes down to
the decisions you make.
And I think it is also, whether it be for the fleet mix
analysis, whether it be for the resource discussion, it is hard
sometimes for us, and we have ongoing work right now, to really
figure out where we might see a disconnect, are they decisions
driven within the Coast Guard, at the department level, or
through discussions between the OMB and DHS and things like
that.
But with respect to the EOC, it has met at least 40 times I
think over the last 15 months. They are dealing with issues
such as OPC, some of the real emerging issues, and I think
there is a lot of promise for that.
Ms. Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Mr. LoBiondo. Admiral, just a little heads up. We are
probably going to schedule a hearing in September on the cost
constrained fleet mix analysis. So that is a little bit of a
heads up there.
Admiral, on the cutter boats, the NSC was built to carry
two classes of stern-launched small boats, each with a
different size and capability to improve their range and
effectiveness. The larger of the two, the long-range
interceptor, did not perform as required, and the smaller boat,
the over-the-horizon, had to be modified to perform correctly.
The Service recently solicited industry for a solution to
replace both classes of small boats. Meanwhile, the NSC cannot
operate at full capability, especially without the long-range
interceptor.
When does the Coast Guard anticipate going to full
production for both classes of cutter boats and when will the
NSC be outfitted with these boats?
Admiral Currier. Thank you, sir, for that question.
I think that this actually is a success story of not only
modernization, but our setup with our integrated Acquisition
Directorate. Whereas we had three classes of cutters produced
by three different manufacturers or builders, we were going to
have likely three different kinds of small boats, or more.
What we have done is we have consolidated requirements and
we have come up with a plan to only acquire a 7-meter cutter
boat and an 11-meter cutter boat. The 11-meter cutter boat will
be the long-range interceptor that is on the National Security
Cutter. The 7-meter cutter boat will fit the National Security
Cutter, the Offshore Patrol Cutter, and the Fast Response
Cutter. We think this makes perfect sense from a logistics
perspective on commonality of parts and support.
In the interim, with the National Security Cutters that are
currently underway, they have a complement of boats. We have a
Mark 4 interceptor boat, a short range boat that is on board
there, that is very similar to what we use in our 270-foot
cutters, and we have an additional interceptor boat that came
from the 123, the 123-foot cutters that, as you know, have been
decommissioned.
So both National Security Cutters that are underway have a
complement of boats, but they are not the complement of boats
that we will provide to them once we achieve the standard
cutter boats in the 7- and 11-meter class. The 7-meter class
will be tested this summer, we look for a contract award late
this fiscal year, and the 11-meter small boat will be tested,
further tested in the fall of this year. So we are very close
to achieving commonality in cutter boats across the classes.
Mr. LoBiondo. Thank you. Only 3 of the Service's fleet of
10, 378-foot High Endurance Cutters, is currently operational.
The fleet is only achieving 75 percent of their targeted days
away from home port and at the same time its operating costs
are more than 300 percent over budget. The Service originally
spent more than $4 million to complete emergency repairs to two
of these vessels and the Coast Guard has not budgeted for an
HEC sustainment program for the next 5 years.
Two years ago, the Coast Guard assured this subcommittee it
was conducting a condition survey of the HEC fleet. Can you
tell me if I am wrong in that no survey was ever conducted? Was
a survey ever conducted?
Admiral Currier. Yes, sir, a survey was conducted.
Mr. LoBiondo. It was conducted.
Admiral Currier. Yes, sir. If I could just explain that one
second. There are various levels of engineering survey that
have taken place. A basic engineering survey of the HEC fleet
took place to start to determine which cutters would be taken
out of service first. An engineering study with more fidelity
is currently ongoing.
But our strategy with the HEC is this: We are going to
maintain that cutter to the minimal level that it is safe to
operate. The cost curves on the HEC, as you have pointed out,
are going exponential on us. This is a 40-year-old ship, it is
very complex, and we have used it hard. We are going to
maintain this ship until we replace it with our NSCs, but we
are going to do it to a level that it is safe to operate and
effective to operate, but no more than that. I think that is
the best answer for the taxpayer.
Mr. LoBiondo. I appreciate that. That is kind of good news
and bad news. It is good news you did the survey. It is bad
news, because we have a communications problem. We need to find
out. I would like you to check into this and see when that was
given to the committee and how it might have been communicated
to the committee, because we are sort of operating in the dark
that we have ever received it.
Admiral Currier. Yes, sir, will do.
Mr. LoBiondo. One other question before I turn it back over
to Mr. Larsen. On the maritime patrol aircraft, to date the
Coast Guard has taken delivery of 11 HC-144 maritime patrol
aircraft and 12 mission system pallets. The Service plans to
acquire a total of 36 aircraft. The program is currently 30
percent over budget and 5 years behind schedule. In addition,
even though the Service has taken delivery of a third of its
planned buy, the Service has not yet begun operational testing
and evaluation of the maritime patrol aircraft.
Can you tell us why the Service has acquired nearly half of
its planned maritime patrol aircraft and has still not begun an
operational test and evaluation phase, or are we wrong and you
have conducted it?
Admiral Currier. Well, sir, the maritime patrol aircraft
was originally initiated, the contracting was initiated through
our lead systems integrator that we have replaced. Organically
we are the lead systems integrator. There was a shift in
contracting. There was a shift. Now we buy directly from the
manufacturer with a direct contract.
That shift caused a price increase in that how we consider
costing that aircraft as we got more fidelity with actuals and
we added other things in, like the logistics tail that hadn't
been adequately considered by the previous LSI, it drove a cost
increase. We are not seeing per se a unit cost increase in the
price of the aircraft. We have just recosted it to adequately
treat logistics. I think that is an explainable cost bump in
what you have seen in our projections in the outyears.
As far as operational test and evaluation, from the first
aircraft we received we started operational assessment. Now, we
have been in limited rate production and we went to the
Department with a production decision and it was decided that
we needed to complete a fuller OT&E prior to getting to the
decision level three or full rate production decisions. So we
have been in limited rate production, but we have had an
ongoing operational assessment for the whole life of this
asset. I think we have shown how effective it is. Deepwater
Horizon, the case I described in Miami in my opening statement.
So our plan is this: We are in limited rate production. We
will complete a formal OT&E, operational test and evaluation
period, this summer, and then we will go back for a full
production decision in the fall, an ADE-3 we call it, and will
be in full production status.
I don't anticipate a problem in OT&E because of the scope
of the operational assessment that has taken place to the
delivery and implementation of the first airframes.
Mr. LoBiondo. Well, I hope you are right, because if you
switch seats and you are on the subcommittee up here and you
are hearing that there is no test, no formal test and
evaluation, and you have bought a whole lot of assets, and
something isn't right down the line, we had a situation in the
past that didn't go so well with assets that were purchased and
then there is litigation and all kinds of stuff. I mean, I hope
you are right.
Admiral Currier. Sir, the operational test that has gone
on, I can attest to you that the fidelity of the operational
assessment from an operational perspective shows this aircraft
with great promise. And throughout the entire scope of this
assessment, there have been changes and upgrades and
modifications to the mission pallet system at the expense of
the contractor that have brought this thing to a mature state.
What will be further testing in formal OT&E are the logistics,
maintenance and all the peripheral things that go with it as a
system. I don't anticipate a problem there.
Mr. LoBiondo. Mr. Larsen.
Mr. Larsen. Mr. Hutton, you have had the opportunity to
reassess Coast Guard's performance in assuming responsibility
for the acquisition, this movement we made from an outside LSI
to internal, them having an acquisition workforce to support
that.
What is your assessment of the Coast Guard's progress on
that, as well within the context of your testimony that states
that support contractors make up 25 percent of the Coast
Guard's acquisition workforce? Can you kind of relate those two
and give us an assessment of the progress of the workforce?
Mr. Hutton. Absolutely. Overall, I would say since the 2007
and 2008 timeframe as the Coast Guard started assuming the lead
system integrator responsibilities, the Acquisition Directorate
in particular has been very responsive to our recommendations.
They have brought their acquisition management process pretty
much in line with the departmental process, which is good. They
have been responsive when we have made recommendations. You
asked a question earlier about the low-rate initial production.
We had a recommendation that said there ought to be a decision
event there because you don't want to be buying too many before
you do the operational testing. That is now in there.
So on the process side, I think they have been very good.
It is always about execution, however. On the personnel side,
it has been a challenge. But it is a governmentwide challenge.
As many of us probably know----
Mr. Larsen. Do you mean to say when you say it is a
governmentwide challenge, just finding enough people to fill
acquisition spots?
Mr. Hutton. I think governmentwide. Having the full
complement of acquisition workforce people is an issue that a
lot of Federal agencies are dealing with, particularly when you
get into some of the real technical skills like system
engineers and cost estimators. We could always talk more about
what is going on I think at the departmental level as well as
at the Coast Guard.
But I would say my general assessment is they are building
their acquisition workforce. When we keep going back in and
looking, they are closing the gap between what they say they
need and what they have. Of course, one aspect of that is they
may know what they need, but then do they have the budgeted
billets for that. That would be for the Coast Guard to
request--they could probably talk about that more than I. But
that is certainly a facet.
Using contractors, we have observed that, yes, they use
contractors. Others like DOD use contractors for certain
technical things. The issue, however, is what are you asking
contractors to do? Is it a reoccurring long-term activity that
you would rather have a government person do it? Well, maybe
you need them in the short term, but what is your plan to
eventually have a government person do that work? What kind of
oversight are you providing the contractor?
If they are doing certain acquisition-related activities,
those are things that closely support an inherently
governmental decision. It is very critical then you understand
what you are asking contractors to do and what enhanced
oversight you might be providing.
We have observed in the past that the Coast Guard was using
contractors, and we started asking more about the oversight. We
were getting good indications that they understand the risks
and that they are trying to make sure that the taxpayers'
interests are protected and they are not losing control and
accountability for decisionmaking.
So we see on the personnel side that the gap is narrowing.
But I don't foresee a situation where they won't be using
contractors, because in some circumstances, particularly if it
is a short-term need, that might be the proper solution.
Mr. Larsen. And has the Coast Guard made improvements in
its developmental and operational testing?
Mr. Hutton. A great question. That was another
recommendation. We had some issues, I think it was covered in
last year's report, maybe the year before, where we were
starting to talk with the Coast Guard about what is exactly an
independent test authority. At the time, I think some Coast
Guard sentiment was that if it is part of the Capabilities
Directorate, that is independent enough. We felt well, it
should be more independent than that. And as we noted in our
report today, they now start to leverage the Navy as the
independent test authority, and we think that is prudent.
Mr. Larsen. Admiral, to the issue of Rescue 21, and we have
talked about some of these other assets and other platforms,
but to the issue of Rescue 21 noted in the Chairman's chart, we
had 37 sectors for planned and delivered to 26 sectors. Can you
discuss your plan to deploy Rescue 21 to these other areas,
Great Lakes, Hawaii, any place where it is not deployed, as
well as the Gulf of Alaska and Alaska as a whole?
Admiral Currier. Yes, sir. Certainly. Thanks for that
question.
Our contract on Rescue 21 is completed in fiscal year 2012.
The deployment to the Western Rivers, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, the
places that you mentioned, absent the Gulf of Alaska, will be
completed by 2012.
Actually, I might have misspoken a little. Let me correct
the record here. The places that are planned in the original
contract will be completed by the end of fiscal 2012. Western
Rivers, because it doesn't require the full suite and
capabilities of Rescue 21 on our river, will be recapitalized
organically by the Coast Guard as they switch from analog to
digital radios. So the effect of reliability and those good
things from Rescue 21 will be achieved in Western Rivers, but
the Coast Guard could do it much more less expensively
organically.
I was involved in Rescue 21 early, and this was one of the
triggers that caused us to reform ourselves acquisition-wise,
because we were dealing with this contract early on. We decided
at that time when we reviewed the prime contractor's look at
Alaska, that they had no clue on what the cost and risk was
involved in going there. Their cost estimates were
unrealistically low.
We looked at it. We are experts in the area, we are the
ones who have maintained the infrastructure up there for years,
and felt that we could do it again organically as we switch and
add incrementally to the capability up there, but do it better
from a government organization perspective than through our
prime contractor.
So, when those decisions were made, they were tough
decisions, and I believe the subcommittee has been advised of
those in the past. I stand by them. I think they make good
business sense. But for the original contract, we will finish
in fiscal year 2012.
Mr. Larsen. So you finish in fiscal year 2012, but, again,
is there a timeframe then for Alaska, or not?
Admiral Currier. Sir, at this time, as I said, this isn't a
complete conversion of Alaska from legacy systems to Rescue 21.
It is an incremental change. As equipment fails, we will
service the site. We likely will upgrade the site at that time.
So this is going to be a longer term.
Mr. Larsen. And will the approach you take to that, like
you take to the Western Rivers, will that be organic, or is
that going to be built into your acquisition, your ACI?
Admiral Currier. We are looking at that closely now. But
the current plan is to maintain the system that is there, do
incremental improvements under our maintenance funding scheme,
with some minor AC&I for planning purposes as we go forward
with this.
To be perfectly honest, we don't have a rock solid plan at
this point for Alaska. We can maintain Alaska to the current
capabilities with our current funding base. But if we look to
recapitalize Alaska or add sites beyond the operational
requirement that was originally established, we will have to
look at an acquisition program that is AC&I funded. Currently,
we have no plans to do that.
Mr. Larsen. Mr. Hutton, I asked the Admiral earlier about
sustainment budgets for the Coast Guard, sustainment for the
legacy assets. And has GAO looked at the sustainment budget for
the Coast Guard and whether or not it is adequate, how it fits
into supporting the Coast Guard mission, how it fits into
supporting the movement to new assets? And do you have an
assessment of it?
Mr. Hutton. While I am responsible for the acquisition
side, I have a colleague that often looks at the operational
issues. I believe they did some work last year. I don't have
all the details. But we would be happy to close the loop with
you on that and see how we could fill in the details.
Mr. Larsen. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. LoBiondo. Admiral Currier, Mr. Hutton, I would like to
thank you very much for being here today. This was informative.
Admiral Currier, I have got good news. We are going to be
spending a lot more time together in the future. It is only bad
news if we can't meet some of these benchmarks. So thank you
all very much. The meeting is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
