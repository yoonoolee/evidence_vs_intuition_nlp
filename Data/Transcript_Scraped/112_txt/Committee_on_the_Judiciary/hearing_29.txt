WEDNESDAY, MARCH 30, 2011

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Intellectual Property,
Competition, and the Internet,
Committee on the Judiciary,
Washington, DC.

The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 1:32 p.m., in
room 2141, Rayburn House Office Building, the Honorable Bob
Goodlatte (Chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding.
Present: Representatives Goodlatte, Smith, Coble,
Sensenbrenner, Chabot, Chaffetz, Reed, Griffin, Marino, Adams,
Quayle, Watt, Conyers, Berman, Chu, Deutch, Sanchez, Lofgren,
and Waters.
Staff Present: (Majority) Blaine Merritt, Subcommittee
Chief Counsel; Vishal Amin, Counsel; Olivia Lee, Clerk; and
Stephanie Moore, Minority Subcommittee Chief Counsel.
Mr. Goodlatte. Folks, we are going to just make an
announcement. We will begin the hearing after this series of
votes. We want to spend a little bit of time on our opening
statements. So it is probably not enough time to get it in
before the votes.
Also, at 2:30 p.m., there is a briefing by some of our
country's leaders regarding the situation in Libya, and so that
all Members can participate, we are going to recess the hearing
at 2:30 p.m. And then we will come back later on.
So this is going to be a herky-jerky afternoon, it sounds
like. But we will get this hearing done, and we will welcome
the testimony of all our witnesses.
So the Committee will stand in recess.
[Recess.]
Mr. Goodlatte. Take two. The Subcommittee will come to
order, and I recognize myself for an opening statement.
For the better part of the past decade, this Committee has
been working to update our patent laws to ensure that the
incentives our Framers envisioned when they wrote article 1,
section 8 of our Constitution remain meaningful and effective.
The U.S. patent system must work efficiently if America is to
remain the world leader in innovation.
It is only right that as more and more inventions with
increasing complexity emerge, we examine our Nation's patent
laws to ensure that they still work efficiently and that they
still encourage and not discourage innovation.
The core principles that have guided our efforts have been
to ensure that quality patents are issued by the PTO in the
first place and to ensure that our patent enforcement laws and
procedures do not create incentives for opportunists with
invalid claims to exploit, while maintaining strong laws that
allow legitimate patent owners to enforce their patents
effectively. H.R. 1249 addresses these principles.
With regard to ensuring the issuance of quality patents,
this legislation allows third parties to submit evidence of
prior art prior to the examination process, which will help
ensure examiners have the full record before them when making
decisions. In addition, after the PTO issues a patent, this
legislation creates a new post grant opposition system in which
third parties can raise objections to a patent immediately
after its issuance, which will both help screen out bad patents
while bolstering valid ones.
The bill also increases patent quality by eliminating fee
diversion, which will allow the PTO to keep all the fees it
collects from inventors. This fee diversion provision is
crucial to allowing PTO to accomplish the mission we are asking
it to do with this bill and will allow the PTO to allocate
resources with certainty.
H.R. 1249 also includes provisions to ensure that patent
litigation benefits those with valid claims, but not those
opportunists who seek to abuse the litigation process. Many
innovative companies, including those in the technology and
other sectors, have been forced to defend against patent
infringement lawsuits of questionable legitimacy.
When such a defendant company truly believes that the
patent being asserted is invalid, it is important for it to
have an avenue to request the PTO to take another look at the
patent in order to better inform the district court of the
patent's validity. This legislation retains an inter partes re-
exam process, which allows innovators to challenge the validity
of a patent when they are sued for patent infringement.
The Senate bill placed many restrictions on the use of the
re-exam procedure, and the House bill relaxes some of those
restrictions in order to maintain the usefulness of the inter
partes re-exam process.
H.R. 1249 is the culmination of years of work in both the
House and the Senate from Democrats and Republicans, and it is
important to note that the House and the Senate, over four
Congresses, we have held dozens of hearings, met with numerous
stakeholders from every industry sector, as well as small and
large businesses and individual inventors, watched judicial
decisions in the courts, and produced several pieces of
legislation.
By giving the necessary tools to the Patent Office to issue
strong patents and procedures that will help ensure certainty
for patentable inventions, we are paving the way for
independent inventors as well as small, medium, and large-sized
enterprises to raise capital and grow. I believe this
legislation will spur innovation, economic growth, and jobs.
However, I also believe some work still needs to be done on
this bill. Specifically, I agree that the PTO needs to have
more certainty with respect to its fee-setting authority. I
want to ensure, however, that Congress maintains strong
oversight over the PTO as it uses that authority.
I also have concerns about the supplemental exam provisions
in the bill and believe further work may need to be done on the
inter partes re-exam procedure to make sure we are striking the
right balance there.
I look forward to hearing from our experts today, many of
whom have been working on this effort for a long, long time.
It is now my pleasure to recognize the Ranking Member of
the Committee, the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt.

``(2) the claimed invention was made as a result of
activities undertaken within the scope of the joint research
agreement; and
``(3) the application for patent for the claimed invention
discloses or is amended to disclose the names of the parties to

is prior art to a claimed invention under subsection (a)(2), such
patent or application shall be considered to have been effectively
filed, with respect to any subject matter described in the patent or
application--
``(1) if paragraph (2) does not apply, as of the actual
filing date of the patent or the application for patent; or
``(2) if the patent or application for patent is entitled
to claim a right of priority under section 119, 365(a), or
365(b), or to claim the benefit of an earlier filing date under

applications for patent, as of the filing date of the earliest
such application that describes the subject matter.''.
(2) Continuity of intent under the create act.--The
enactment of section 102(c) of title 35, United States Code,

invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a
whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the
claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which
the claimed invention pertains. Patentability shall not be negated by
the manner in which the invention was made.''.

(2) Conforming amendment.--The item relating to section 291
in the table of sections for chapter 29 of title 35, United
States Code, is amended to read as follows:

``291. Derived patents.''.
(i) Derivation Proceedings.--Section 135 of title 35, United States
Code, is amended to read as follows:

``Sec. 135. Derivation proceedings

``(a) Institution of Proceeding.--An applicant for patent may file
a petition to institute a derivation proceeding in the Office. The
petition shall set forth with particularity the basis for finding that
an inventor named in an earlier application derived the claimed
invention from an inventor named in the petitioner's application and,
without authorization, the earlier application claiming such invention
was filed. Any such petition may be filed only within the 1-year period
beginning the date of the first publication of a claim to an invention
that is the same or substantially the same as the earlier application's
claim to the invention, shall be made under oath, and shall be
supported by substantial evidence. Whenever the Director determines
that a petition filed under this subsection demonstrates that the
standards for instituting a derivation proceeding are met, the Director
may institute a derivation proceeding. The determination by the
Director whether to institute a derivation proceeding shall be final
and nonappealable.
``(b) Determination by Patent Trial and Appeal Board.--In a
derivation proceeding instituted under subsection (a), the Patent Trial
and Appeal Board shall determine whether an inventor named in the
earlier application derived the claimed invention from an inventor
named in the petitioner's application and, without authorization, the
earlier application claiming such invention was filed. The Director
shall prescribe regulations setting forth standards for the conduct of
derivation proceedings.
``(c) Deferral of Decision.--The Patent Trial and Appeal Board may
defer action on a petition for a derivation proceeding until the
expiration of the 3-month period beginning on the date on which the
Director issues a patent that includes the claimed invention that is
the subject of the petition. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board also may
defer action on a petition for a derivation proceeding, or stay the
proceeding after it has been instituted, until the termination of a
proceeding under chapter 30, 31, or 32 involving the patent of the
earlier applicant.
``(d) Effect of Final Decision.--The final decision of the Patent
Trial and Appeal Board, if adverse to claims in an application for
patent, shall constitute the final refusal by the Office on those
claims. The final decision of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, if
adverse to claims in a patent, shall, if no appeal or other review of
the decision has been or can be taken or had, constitute cancellation
of those claims, and notice of such cancellation shall be endorsed on
copies of the patent distributed after such cancellation.
``(e) Settlement.--Parties to a proceeding instituted under
subsection (a) may terminate the proceeding by filing a written
statement reflecting the agreement of the parties as to the correct
inventors of the claimed invention in dispute. Unless the Patent Trial
and Appeal Board finds the agreement to be inconsistent with the
evidence of record, if any, it shall take action consistent with the
agreement. Any written settlement or understanding of the parties shall
be filed with the Director. At the request of a party to the
proceeding, the agreement or understanding shall be treated as business
confidential information, shall be kept separate from the file of the
involved patents or applications, and shall be made available only to
Government agencies on written request, or to any person on a showing
of good cause.
``(f) Arbitration.--Parties to a proceeding instituted under
subsection (a) may, within such time as may be specified by the
Director by regulation, determine such contest or any aspect thereof by
arbitration. Such arbitration shall be governed by the provisions of
title 9, to the extent such title is not inconsistent with this
section. The parties shall give notice of any arbitration award to the
Director, and such award shall, as between the parties to the
arbitration, be dispositive of the issues to which it relates. The
arbitration award shall be unenforceable until such notice is given.
Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Director from determining
the patentability of the claimed inventions involved in the
proceeding.''.
(j) Elimination of References to Interferences.--(1) Sections 134,
145, 146, 154, 305, and 314 of title 35, United States Code, are each
amended by striking ``Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences'' each
place it appears and inserting ``Patent Trial and Appeal Board''.

``(a) In General.--An inter partes review instituted under this
chapter shall be terminated with respect to any petitioner upon the
joint request of the petitioner and the patent owner, unless the Office

written request, or to any other person on a showing of good cause.

``Sec. 318. Decision of the Board

``(b) Certificate.--If the Patent Trial and Appeal Board issues a
final written decision under subsection (a) and the time for appeal has
expired or any appeal has terminated, the Director shall issue and

determined to be patentable, and incorporating in the patent by
operation of the certificate any new or amended claim determined to be
patentable.

``Sec. 320. Request for stay of certain proceedings

``If a party seeks a stay of a civil action alleging infringement
of a patent under section 281, or a proceeding before the International
Trade Commission under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, relating
to an inter partes review under this chapter, the court shall decide
whether to enter a stay based on--
``(1) whether a stay, or the denial thereof, will simplify
the issues in question and streamline the trial;
``(2) whether discovery is complete and whether a trial
date has been set;
``(3) whether a stay, or the denial thereof, would unduly
prejudice the nonmoving party or present a clear tactical
advantage for the moving party; and
``(4) whether a stay, or the denial thereof, will reduce
the burden of litigation on the parties and on the court.''.
(b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of chapters for part III of

person who is not the patent owner may file with the Office a petition
to institute a post-grant review of a patent. The Director shall
establish, by regulation, fees to be paid by the person requesting the
review, in such amounts as the Director determines to be reasonable,
considering the aggregate costs of the post-grant review.
``(b) Scope.--A petitioner in a post-grant review may request to
cancel as unpatentable 1 or more claims of a patent on any ground that
could be raised under paragraph (2) or (3) of section 282(b) (relating
to invalidity of the patent or any claim).
``(c) Filing Deadline.--A petition for a post-grant review may only
be filed not later than the date that is 12 months after the date of
the grant of the patent or of the issuance of a reissue patent (as the
case may be).

``Sec. 322. Petitions

``(a) Requirements of Petition.--A petition filed under section 321
may be considered only if--
``(1) the petition is accompanied by payment of the fee
established by the Director under section 321;
``(2) the petition identifies all real parties in interest;
``(3) the petition identifies, in writing and with
particularity, each claim challenged, the grounds on which the
challenge to each claim is based, and the evidence that
supports the grounds for the challenge to each claim,

that the petitioner relies upon in support of the
petition; and
``(B) affidavits or declarations of supporting
evidence and opinions, if the petitioner relies on
other factual evidence or on expert opinions;

documents required under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) to the
patent owner or, if applicable, the designated representative
of the patent owner.
``(b) Public Availability.--As soon as practicable after the
receipt of a petition under section 321, the Director shall make the
petition available to the public.

``Sec. 323. Preliminary response to petition

``(a) Preliminary Response.--If a post-grant review petition is
filed under section 321, the patent owner shall have the right to file
a preliminary response to the petition within 2 months after the date
on which the petition is filed.
``(b) Content of Response.--A preliminary response to a petition
for post-grant review shall set forth reasons why no post-grant review
should be instituted based upon the failure of the petition to meet any
requirement of this chapter.

``Sec. 324. Institution of post-grant review

``(a) Threshold.--The Director may not authorize a post-grant
review to commence unless the Director determines that the information
presented in the petition filed under section 321, if such information
is not rebutted, would demonstrate that it is more likely than not that
at least 1 of the claims challenged in the petition is unpatentable.
``(b) Additional Grounds.--The determination required under
subsection (a) may also be satisfied by a showing that the petition
raises a novel or unsettled legal question that is important to other
patents or patent applications.
``(c) Timing.--The Director shall determine whether to institute a
post-grant review under this chapter pursuant to a petition filed under
section 321 within 3 months after--
``(1) receiving a preliminary response to the petition
under section 323; or
``(2) if no such preliminary response is filed, the last
date on which such response may be filed.
``(d) Notice.--The Director shall notify the petitioner and patent
owner, in writing, of the Director's determination under subsection (a)
or (b), and shall make such notice available to the public as soon as
is practicable. The Director shall make each notice of the institution
of a post-grant review available to the public. Such notice shall
include the date on which the review shall commence.
``(e) No Appeal.--The determination by the Director whether to
institute a post-grant review under this section shall be final and
nonappealable.

``Sec. 325. Relation to other proceedings or actions

``(a) Infringer's Civil Action.--
``(1) Post-grant review barred by civil action.--A post-
grant review may not be instituted under this chapter if,
before the date on which the petition for such a review is
filed, the petitioner, real party in interest, or privy of the
petitioner filed a civil action challenging the validity of a
claim of the patent.
``(2) Stay of civil action.--If the petitioner, real party
in interest, or privy of the petitioner files a civil action
challenging the validity of a claim of the patent on or after
the date on which the petitioner files a petition for post-
grant review of the patent, that civil action shall be
automatically stayed until either--
``(A) the patent owner requests to lift the stay;
``(B) the patent owner files a civil action or
counterclaim alleging that the petitioner, real party
in interest, or privy of the petitioner has infringed
the patent; or
``(C) the petitioner, real party in interest, or
privy of the petitioner requests to dismiss his civil
action.
``(3) Treatment of counterclaim.--A counterclaim
challenging the validity of a claim of a patent does not
constitute a civil action challenging the validity of a claim
of a patent for purposes of this subsection.
``(b) Preliminary Injunctions.--If a civil action alleging
infringement of a patent is filed within 3 months after the date on
which the patent is granted, the court may not stay its consideration
of the patent owner's motion for a preliminary injunction against
infringement of the patent on the basis that a petition for post-grant
review has been filed under this chapter or that such a post-grant
review has been instituted under this chapter.
``(c) Joinder.--If more than 1 petition for a post-grant review
under this chapter is properly filed against the same patent and the
Director determines that more than 1 of these petitions warrants the
institution of a post-grant review under section 324, the Director may
consolidate such reviews into a single post-grant review.
``(d) Multiple Proceedings.--Notwithstanding sections 135(a), 251,
and 252, and chapter 30, during the pendency of any post-grant review
under this chapter, if another proceeding or matter involving the
patent is before the Office, the Director may determine the manner in
which the post-grant review or other proceeding or matter may proceed,
including providing for the stay, transfer, consolidation, or
termination of any such matter or proceeding. In determining whether to
institute or order a proceeding under this chapter, chapter 30, or
chapter 31, the Director may take into account whether, and reject the
petition or request because, the same or substantially the same prior
art or arguments previously were presented to the Office.
``(e) Estoppel.--
``(1) Proceedings before the office.--The petitioner in a
post-grant review under this chapter, or the real party in
interest or privy of the petitioner, may not request or
maintain a proceeding before the Office with respect to a claim
on any ground that the petitioner raised or reasonably could
have raised during a post-grant review of the claim that
resulted in a final written decision under section 328(a).
``(2) Civil actions and other proceedings.--The petitioner
in a post-grant review under this chapter, or the real party in
interest or privy of the petitioner, may not assert either in a
civil action arising in whole or in part under section 1338 of
title 28 or in a proceeding before the International Trade
Commission under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 that a
claim in a patent is invalid on any ground that the petitioner
raised during a post-grant review of the claim that resulted in
a final written decision under section 328(a).
``(f) Reissue Patents.--A post-grant review may not be instituted
under this chapter if the petition requests cancellation of a claim in
a reissue patent that is identical to or narrower than a claim in the
original patent from which the reissue patent was issued, and the time
limitations in section 321(c) would bar filing a petition for a post-
grant review for such original patent.

``Sec. 326. Conduct of post-grant review

``(a) Regulations.--The Director shall prescribe regulations--
``(1) providing that the file of any proceeding under this
chapter shall be made available to the public, except that any
petition or document filed with the intent that it be sealed
shall, if accompanied by a motion to seal, be treated as sealed
pending the outcome of the ruling on the motion;
``(2) setting forth the standards for the showing of
sufficient grounds to institute a review under subsections (a)
and (b) of section 324;

of relevant evidence, including that such discovery shall be
limited to evidence directly related to factual assertions
advanced by either party in the proceeding;
``(6) prescribing sanctions for abuse of discovery, abuse
of process, or any other improper use of the proceeding, such
as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or an unnecessary
increase in the cost of the proceeding;
``(7) providing for protective orders governing the
exchange and submission of confidential information;
``(8) allowing the patent owner to file a response to the
petition after a post-grant review has been instituted, and
requiring that the patent owner file with such response,
through affidavits or declarations, any additional factual
evidence and expert opinions on which the patent owner relies
in support of the response;
``(9) setting forth standards and procedures for allowing
the patent owner to move to amend the patent under subsection
(d) to cancel a challenged claim or propose a reasonable number
of substitute claims, and ensuring that any information
submitted by the patent owner in support of any amendment
entered under subsection (d) is made available to the public as
part of the prosecution history of the patent;
``(10) providing either party with the right to an oral
hearing as part of the proceeding; and
``(11) requiring that the final determination in any post-
grant review be issued not later than 1 year after the date on
which the Director notices the institution of a proceeding
under this chapter, except that the Director may, for good
cause shown, extend the 1-year period by not more than 6
months, and may adjust the time periods in this paragraph in
the case of joinder under section 325(c).
``(b) Considerations.--In prescribing regulations under this
section, the Director shall consider the effect of any such regulation
on the economy, the integrity of the patent system, the efficient
administration of the Office, and the ability of the Office to timely
complete proceedings instituted under this chapter.
``(c) Patent Trial and Appeal Board.--The Patent Trial and Appeal
Board shall, in accordance with section 6, conduct each proceeding
authorized by the Director.
``(d) Amendment of the Patent.--
``(1) In general.--During a post-grant review instituted
under this chapter, the patent owner may file 1 motion to amend
the patent in 1 or more of the following ways:
``(A) Cancel any challenged patent claim.
``(B) For each challenged claim, propose a
reasonable number of substitute claims.
``(2) Additional motions.--Additional motions to amend may
be permitted upon the joint request of the petitioner and the
patent owner to materially advance the settlement of a
proceeding under section 327, or upon the request of the patent
owner for good cause shown.
``(3) Scope of claims.--An amendment under this subsection
may not enlarge the scope of the claims of the patent or
introduce new matter.
``(e) Evidentiary Standards.--In a post-grant review instituted
under this chapter, the petitioner shall have the burden of proving a
proposition of unpatentability by a preponderance of the evidence.

``Sec. 327. Settlement

``(a) In General.--A post-grant review instituted under this
chapter shall be terminated with respect to any petitioner upon the
joint request of the petitioner and the patent owner, unless the Office
has decided the merits of the proceeding before the request for
termination is filed. If the post-grant review is terminated with
respect to a petitioner under this section, no estoppel under section
325(e) shall apply to that petitioner. If no petitioner remains in the
post-grant review, the Office may terminate the post-grant review or
proceed to a final written decision under section 328(a).

between the patent owner and a petitioner, including any collateral
agreements referred to in such agreement or understanding, made in
connection with, or in contemplation of, the termination of a post-
grant review under this section shall be in writing, and a true copy of
such agreement or understanding shall be filed in the Office before the

shall be made available only to Federal Government agencies upon
written request, or to any other person on a showing of good cause.

``Sec. 328. Decision of the Board

``(a) Final Written Decision.--If a post-grant review is instituted

Mr. Watt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And at the outset, I am going to ask the Chairman for a
little indulgence today to give a slightly longer statement
than I usually do.
As late as yesterday afternoon, I had hoped to start this
opening statement by proudly proclaiming that I was one of the
many cosponsors of a broadly bipartisan, widely supported
patent reform bill, which, while perhaps not perfected to the
point of deserving final passage, the legislative counterpart
to receiving an A rating on a first patent application review,
would surely lead us ultimately to the long-awaited patent
reform promised land.
I had hoped that making that broad-based bipartisan start
would put us well on the way to our inter partes dispute
resolution process with the Senate and ultimately to the
President of the United States granting our patent. I mean,
signing our legislation into law.
Unfortunately, we are not there yet. So I need to begin
this opening statement at a much more basic place, with
reminders of where this all starts and why it is so important.
I start with the Constitution. The Constitution gives
Congress the power to promote the progress of science and
useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and
inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and
discoveries.
The objective of the Patent Act is to implement this
constitutional authority by encouraging, supporting, and
rewarding the ingenuity of our inventors by providing them
exclusionary rights to their creation for a period of 20 years.
In exchange, the inventor discloses to the public the details
of his or her invention, setting off a ripple effect of further
creativity and development.
This simple concept embedded in our Constitution--
congressional promotion of innovation--finds itself in yet
another term of Congress in search of a modern-day viable
patent reform bill. Today, Chairman Smith introduced the
America Invents Act to begin that process. I applaud him for
his efforts.
And while I am encouraged by discussions with Chairmen
Smith and Goodlatte and other Members of this Subcommittee, and
the full Committee, to borrow a phrase from one of our earlier
hearings, there is still work ahead of us to get comprehensive
reform ``across the finish line.''
During the past debates on comprehensive patent reform, I
don't need to tell most people in this room there have been
numerous declarations to the effect that ``the time is now for
true patent reform.'' And yet the finish line has proven
elusive, and reform efforts have dissipated or certainly failed
to cross the finish line.
But we now have a unique opportunity to accomplish that
goal and get across the finish line. Past debates have provided
a solid foundation for optimism. Chairman Smith, Chairman
Goodlatte, Mr. Conyers, Mr. Coble, Mr. Berman, and many other
Members of this Committee, past and present, have cosponsored
bills over the years aimed at transforming our patent system
into an efficient forum for America's inventors.
Their steadfast leadership has no doubt contributed to the
widespread recognition of the importance of the patent system
to our economy, job creation, and prominence in intellectual
property advancement in the world.
Today, we find all three branches of Government taking an
active interest and energetic role in modernizing the patent
system. Both the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit have
taken on and resolved many of the litigation-related issues
that animated earlier calls for legislative relief.
President Obama has made patent reform, along with
education and intellectual property protection and enforcement
activities, the centerpieces of his innovation agenda. Director
Kappos has played a vital role in that agenda, convening
special sessions with key stakeholders to mediate some of the
competing concerns.
The Senate has passed a bill, and we have initiated the
process of establishing a robust statutory framework that will
stimulate innovation and growth, provide adequate safeguards
against abuses, and shore up the PTO to meet its crucial
responsibilities.
The question each participant in this process should now be
asking is, ``Will I allow all that hard work and momentum to
dissipate because I don't get exactly what I want on every
issue that impacts me?'' If your personal answer to that
question is yes, let me say unequivocally that I think you are
in the wrong place.
The bill introduced by Chairman Smith definitively provides
the resources the PTO earns and deserves by permanently ending
the practice of fee diversion and by guaranteeing to the PTO
access to all the user-generated fees it collects. This
provision has universal support, and I thank the Chairman for
accepting some language that we offered to ensure compliance
with new House CUTGO rules. This provision will go a long way
toward helping the PTO to stabilize and eventually eliminate
its 700,000 backlog of applications.
Other provisions in the America Invents Act and some that
have not been included I believe require further examination
and, at this juncture, have less than universal support. But
despite the appearance that may be projected by the failure to
have a broad bipartisan bill at this point, these divisions are
not partisan. I repeat, they are not partisan.
Rather, they consist of legitimate substantive differences
and approaches based on a variety of factors. For example,
conversion from a first-to-invent to a first-to-file system has
been portrayed by some as necessary to harmonize U.S. practice
with the international community. Others argue that true
harmonization and, indeed, balancing the interest of first
filers, who may not actually be first inventors, with real
first inventors, who may not be first filers, requires that
expansion of prior use rights comparable to that employed by
the rest of the patent-issuing countries, with some exceptions,
still needs to be implemented.
Still others have expressed the view that prior user rights
have no place in our country that has a public university
system unlike any other that engages in valuable public-private
collaborative research and development. Patent law currently
affords first inventors a 1-year grace period during which an
inventor can disclose, publish, or use his invention without
fear of forfeiting his right to a patent, provided he applies
before the expiration of the grace period.
The grace period is uncommon in the rest of the world and
yet has become an integral part of the PTO patenting process
and is coveted by most innovators. How the grace period will
operate in a first-to-file system, i.e., whether the duration
of the grace period should be adjusted upward or downward, is a
legitimate, substantive question.
Finally, what mechanisms are necessary to afford effective
and affordable post grant review procedures? Under current law,
there are two tracks available to challenge a patent after it
has been issued, each with its own limitations. Is a third
track similar to the post grant reviews in other countries a
necessary tool, or will it pile onto the already overburdened,
understaffed PTO or add further unwarranted delays to getting
final court determinations?
Again, I believe these are not frivolous questions. Many of
these issues have been central to the debate in past
Congresses, and yet we have already seen that a sea change in
the judicial approach to patent law dispense with the need for
the litigation-related reform proposals of old.
We should not allow this debate to become a missed
opportunity to effectuate genuine, long-lasting, effective
reform of what most consider an antiquated system by holding
onto our selfish, sometimes myopic views and refusing to
compromise.
Over the past few decades, our economy has shifted from a
manufacturing economy to one rooted in intellectual property
rights. It is extremely important that our patent system
continue to incentivize ideas and protect engines of growth.
Innovation will no doubt continue despite a sluggish patent
system, as evidenced by the ongoing backlog and intake of
applications.
But I believe we need to get this right. Unless we are
prepared to relinquish our positions at the forefront of
innovation, invention, and ingenuity, we must produce a bill
that at a minimum exceeds even the best components of patent
systems around the world.
I believe this Subcommittee, with an infusion of new blood
on both sides of the aisle and the invaluable experience of our
veterans, stands ready to negotiate a bipartisan product that
we can all be proud of, one that embodies core features that
will produce quality patents, efficient procedures, effective
reviews, affordable processes, and safeguards against abuse and
harassment.
In closing, Mr. Chairman, a little anecdote. In my
district, I engage in a project called Trading Places. Maybe
some of you are more familiar with the television show
Undercover Boss. Both operate on the premise that you can
acquire a deep appreciation of the other guy when you are
required to experience life in his perspective.
If there is one important lesson that has been reinforced
for me throughout my time in Congress is that progress requires
compromise, simple give and take on everyone's views. In the
practice of law, we always said that the definition of a good
compromise was one that made all parties unhappy.
So I would encourage all of the stakeholders involved to
optimize the results of this process by concentrating their
efforts on the genuine, universal changes essential to making
the patent process work for everybody. The alternative is, in
the words of Yogi Berra, ``deja vu all over again.''
I thank the Chairman for his indulgence and yield back.
Mr. Goodlatte. I thank the gentleman.
The Chair now recognizes the Chairman of the Judiciary
Committee and the sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman
from Texas, Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And also, Mr. Chairman, I appreciated your opening
statement and also appreciated Mr. Watt's opening remarks as
well. While lengthy, he raised a number of good points, and I
would only add to Mr. Watt's comment or his definition of
compromise is that maybe we can come up with a compromise plus.
Rather than making everybody equally unhappy, maybe we can make
everybody just a little bit happy and come up with a good
product in the end.
Mr. Chairman, the foresight of the Founders in creating an
intellectual property system in the Constitution demonstrates
their understanding of how patent rights ultimately benefit the
American people. Technological innovation derived from our
intellectual property is linked to three-quarters of America's
economic growth, and American IP industries now account for
over half of all U.S. exports. These industries also provide
millions of Americans with well-paying jobs.
Our patent laws, which provide a time-limited monopoly to
inventors in exchange for their creative talents, perpetuate
this prosperity. The last major patent reform was nearly 60
years ago. Since then, American inventors have helped to put a
man on the Moon, developed cell phones, and created the
Internet.
But we cannot protect the technologies of today with the
tools of the past. The current patent system is outdated and
bogged down by frivolous lawsuits and uncertainty regarding
patent ownership. Frivolous lawsuits that typically cost $5
million to defend prevent legitimate inventors and industrious
companies from creating amazing products and generating high-
paying jobs.
We must work with the Senate to enact a bill that enhances
patent quality, discourages frivolous litigation, harmonizes
international patent principles, and enforces core rights. The
major problem plaguing the patent system is the lack of
resources available to the PTO. The bill allows the director to
adjust the fee schedule with appropriate congressional
oversight and authorizes the agency to keep all the revenue it
raises.
This will enable PTO to become more efficient and
productive. Patent quality will improve on the front end, which
will reduce litigation on the back end.
And while we are pleased with the Senate's action, the
Senate bill doesn't make inter partes re-examination as user
friendly as it might be. Every industry affected by patents,
including finance, automotive, manufacturing, high tech, and
pharmaceuticals, will benefit from these reforms.
The purpose of today's hearing is to identify common ground
and establish priorities. For example, given the political
context in which we must legislate, I think we have been very
fair to high tech. Also, the bill doesn't address many
litigation reform issues because the courts are handing down
decisions on damages, venue, and other subjects.
And we lengthened the filing deadlines for post grant
opposition and inter partes re-exam, lowered the threshold
trigger for inter partes, and enhanced prior user rights in
response to tech request. Also, the bill includes a clear
exclusion for the university community to prior user rights and
a Bayh-Dole provision that allows universities to keep a
greater share of their patent licensing revenue. It is a good
deal for many in the university community.
However, it disappoints me that some stakeholders are only
concentrating on what they don't have. Ultimately, this patent
reform must strike a delicate balance. There is a reason why
patent reform bills have not been enacted over the last four
Congresses. It is impossible for any one group to get
everything that they want.
This bill represents a fair compromise and creates a better
patent system than exists today for inventors in our innovative
industries. All of us should maintain a broader perspective if
we want to enact a bipartisan, bicameral bill, and we must keep
our common goal in mind.
Better patents increase productivity and lead to economic
prosperity. A modernized patent system will rev the engine of
American competitiveness, put inventors and innovators in gear,
and drive economic growth and job creation.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yield back.
Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We are improvising as we move along here. As we announced
earlier, the Committee is going to stand in recess for the
briefing on Libya by some of our country's leaders.
However, I have just learned that Mr. Kappos has to be
leaving the country shortly. So what I would like to do is I
will stay, and anyone is invited to stay as well, to hear his
testimony.
And then we will recess, and we will submit any questions
we have in writing to you. When we return, we will begin with
the second panel.
So, briefly, I will introduce the Honorable David J.
Kappos, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual
Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark
Office. In this role, he advises the President, the Secretary
of Commerce, and the Administration on intellectual property
matters.
Before joining the PTO, Mr. Kappos led the intellectual
property law department at IBM. He has served on the Board of
Directors of the American Intellectual Property Law
Association, the Intellectual Property Owners Association, and
the International Intellectual Property Society. He has held
various other leadership positions in intellectual property law
associations in Asia and the United States and has spoken on
intellectual property topics around the world.
Mr. Kappos received his Bachelor of Science degree in
electrical and computer engineering from the University of
California-Davis in 1983 and his law degree from the University
of California at Berkeley in 1990.
Welcome, Mr. Kappos.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. Mr. Chairman? If the Chairman will yield
for a bit? Is Mr. Kappos going to be able to answer questions
after his testimony, or is he just going to split?
Mr. Goodlatte. He is going to have to leave, and we are
going to submit questions to him in writing, which we will ask
him to answer promptly.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. Well, I hope he comes back because that
is not acceptable.
Mr. Goodlatte. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Kappos, welcome.

TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE DAVID J. KAPPOS, UNDER SECRETARY OF
COMMERCE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIRECTOR, THE UNITED
STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

Mr. Kappos. Well, thank you, Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking
Member Watt, and Chairman Smith, Members of the Subcommittee.
Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the Department of
Commerce's and the USPTO'S views on patent reform today.
Mr. Chairman, we commend you and your colleagues for
introducing H.R. 1249. Reforming our patent system will support
and encourage innovation that improves American
competitiveness, economic prosperity, and job growth. It is
past due.
We believe that enactment of the legislation now under
consideration will significantly improve our patent processes,
reduce litigation uncertainties and costs, and increase the
value of patent rights for American innovators.
There are several critical proposals under consideration.
We view the proposed transition to a first-inventor-to-file
system as an essential feature of any final bill. The
transition will simplify the process of acquiring rights while
maintaining a 1-year grace period that protects innovators. It
will reduce legal costs, improve fairness, objectivity, and
transparency, and support U.S. innovators doing business
abroad.
Some contend that the proposed transition will only benefit
large patent owners to the disadvantage of independent
inventors. This fear is unfounded and inconsistent with the
facts.
In the past 7 years of over three million patent
applications filed in the USPTO, only 25 patents were granted
to small entities that were the second inventor to file but
were able to prove they were first to invent. And of those 25,
only one patent was granted to an independent inventor.
Thus, in the last 7 years, only one independent inventor's
filing would have received a different outcome under the first-
inventor-to-file system. That is 1 in 3 million.
Further, the cost of proving who is a first to invent under
the current system is prohibitive. It costs an average of
$400,000 to $500,000 in legal fees to engage in interference
proceedings. Most independent inventors simply do not have the
resources for these proceedings.
Mr. Chairman, the facts demonstrate that the current system
actually favors those with deep pockets and works to the
disadvantage of small companies and independent inventors with
limited resources. The new first-to-file system will instead
benefit small entity filers by giving them a transparent,
objective, simple system with no hidden traps or costs.
With respect to funding, we are pleased that the proposed
legislation includes authority for the USPTO to establish and
adjust its fees. Fee-setting authority would be accompanied by
strong oversight and input from our advisory committees, by
stakeholders, and by Congress, in addition to the oversight we
receive from OMB and from the Department of Commerce.
Fee-setting authority, coupled with full availability of
fee collections through a revolving fund, will permit the USPTO
to achieve a stable funding model that supports long-term
improvements in operations.
Mr. Chairman, we also support establishment of a new post
grant review proceeding and the retooling of our existing post
grant re-examination procedure. These review proceedings will
minimize costs and increase certainty by offering efficient
alternatives to litigation as a means of reviewing questions of
patent validity. Several factors provided in this legislation
will ensure manageable implementation, including the delayed
effective dates, the authority to set fees and issue
administrative and procedural regulations, and the authority to
impose limits on the number of reviews during the first 4
years.
Also, we are confident that the provisions will prevent
delay and abusive challenges while enabling challenges based on
meritorious grounds.
Mr. Chairman, as a quality-focused measure, we support
provisions that increase the opportunity for third parties to
submit relevant prior art after publication and before
examination. We are pleased to see that the legislative process
has refocused to specifically address patent quality and patent
operations improvements that can be implemented by the USPTO.
In light of recent court decisions relating to damages
assessments, willfulness, and venue considerations, we support
removal of related provisions in patent reform legislation. The
House bill would also expand current prior user defense to all
areas of technology and includes an exemption when this defense
is raised in litigation against a university.
Expanding the prior user defense is pro-manufacturer, pro-
small business, and on balance, good policy. But I am aware of
university community concerns and would like to help address
them.
Mr. Chairman, again, we commend you for introducing H.R.
1249. We look forward to working with you toward enactment of
patent reform legislation that supports America's innovators
and spurs economic growth and job creation.
Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Kappos follows:]

__________
Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you, Mr. Kappos.
The Ranking Member and I have consulted. And in order to
accommodate the concerns of the Chairman emeritus, I am going
to ask him to take the Chair and ask the questions that he
would like to ask. And then ask him to recognize the
gentlewoman from California, Ms. Lofgren, who will ask some
questions.
I believe that will just about use up your time and keep
you on schedule, and the rest of us will submit our questions
in writing.
We may want to defer to the Chairman of the Committee as
well.
Mr. Sensenbrenner [presiding]. Well, I thank the Chair of
the Subcommittee for this minor modification of what is not
acceptable. This is a pretty important bill. And simply to have
Mr. Kappos here and answer questions from two or three Members
of the Subcommittee and not have another shot at you, you know,
I think gets this bill off to a very, very wrong foot.
And it is my hope that we do a little bit better job in
terms of scheduling things so that we can get the issues on the
table, which, in my opinion, is a necessary precondition in
order to get the support to pass this bill.
Now, Mr. Kappos, I have got a big concern about prior user
rights and the changes this bill proposes and which apparently
the Administration supports. During my tenure as Chairman of
both the Science and Judiciary Committees, I have learned
firsthand the importance of publication and disclosure in the
patent law.
And in 2007, I coauthored with Ms. Baldwin an amendment on
the House floor to remove the prior user rights expansion from
the patent reform bill then under consideration, and now it is
back on the table. I fear that expanding prior user rights will
harm inventors who share their knowledge and discovery and
reward those who choose to stay silent, keep innovation secret,
and don't contribute to the products of science.
Now the Obama administration has given an indication of
support for section 4 of the America COMPETES Act, which
significantly increases prior user rights, which goes directly
opposite to the amendment that Ms. Baldwin and I offered. And
that effectively puts trade secrecy in the patent law with a
powerful incentive--a royalty-free statutory license.
Section 4 also confers its benefits outside the United
States. So, for example, can the Chinese simply raise a prior
user rights defense against a patent infringement claim, and
how does that help America compete?
Mr. Kappos. Well, thank you very much, Representative
Sensenbrenner. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to
respond on prior user rights.
So, first of all, I want to point out there is no
Administration position on prior user rights yet, with the bill
just having been introduced.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. When will there be because this is not a
new issue to be debated?
Mr. Kappos. Well, now that the bill is introduced, we will
be putting together a position here as quickly as possible. I
would offer a few observations of my own, if that is okay? And
those include, number one, that we are very concerned about
university concerns and university issues. We are listening to
the universities and want to continue to work with them.
We want to have a prior user rights provision that meets
the needs of America's important university community. So we
stand very much with you on that point.
I believe there are, however, many incentives to file
patent applications in front of the USPTO. We will receive more
than 500,000 patent applications this year. And so, I do not
view a prior user provision as being in conflict with all of
the good reasons to file patent applications and with the
disclosure incentive of the patent system.
I also think that prior user rights have the advantage of
being very pro-American manufacturing. Currently, there is
actually an incentive for American businesses to locate their
factories overseas, whether it be China or any other country.
And the reason is because all of those other countries have
prior user rights.
And that means that if a patent is registered, if a patent
is enforced in that country, it cannot be used against your
manufacturing if your manufacturing facility qualifies for the
prior user rights in those countries. The U.S., not having a
prior user rights system, is at a comparative disadvantage with
those other countries, and the message that we are sending to
our manufacturers, especially small manufacturers, is that you
are in jeopardy.
Even if you set up a manufacturing plant in this country
and have it running for several years, you are in jeopardy of
being attacked with a patent that is potentially filed much
later than your manufacturing. And so, you can avoid that
dilemma by locating your factory overseas. I would like to see
that competitive advantage----
Mr. Sensenbrenner. Well, I strongly disagree with you. I
think that the prior user rights expansion is going to end up
giving China a ``get out of jail free'' card. And I have spent
a good part of the last 15 years yelling about Chinese piracy
of intellectual property rights, and I am afraid that we are
just legalizing that with the prior user rights expansion that
is contained in the draft bill, and this very well could be a
poison pill.
Now the other point that I want to make is I think that it
would be very wise to separate out the ban on fee diversion so
that can be passed independently of the base patent bill, which
I think is going to become very controversial. I think
everybody here agrees that getting rid of the fee diversion is
a step in the right direction.
And there might be those that want to use that as a way to
boost a bad bill to the goal line. I think that the thing to do
is to free the fee diversion and let it be passed and signed,
and then let the rest of the bill sink or swim.
My time is up. The gentlewoman from California, Ms.
Lofgren?
Ms. Lofgren. Thank you, Mr. Sensenbrenner.
And I agree that it would be terrific to have more time to
discuss this with the director. I would like to say that this
is the first time I have walked in on a patent hearing when we
had to have an overflow room. So that was exciting.
You know, I have a number of questions. First, on the re-
exam, inter partes re-exam. It is my understanding that from
1999 to the end of last year that the office issued decisions
in the total of 221 re-exams. And that of those cases, 90
percent resulted in invalidation of at least one claim of the
patent that was being challenged. Is that correct?
Mr. Kappos. Right offhand, that sounds like it is correct.
Ms. Lofgren. So that would seem to say that in the
overwhelming majority of these matters, the re-exams have some
merit?
Mr. Kappos. Yes.
Ms. Lofgren. And that allegations that the current system
is being abused might be off the mark. Would you say that is
correct?
Mr. Kappos. I would agree with that.
Ms. Lofgren. Some have said that the current standard for
initiation is too low. Now it seems to me that you should be
able to require at least a prima facie showing of invalidity to
move something forward. On the other hand, we don't want you,
as the director, to make the decision before everything has
been made. What is your thought on that issue?
Mr. Kappos. Right. Well, your statistics are, indeed,
consistent with what we are seeing continuing into this year.
We have processed now hundreds of inter partes re-examinations,
and what we are finding is that our rate of what is called
``false positives,'' or cases that get over the SNQ threshold,
is relatively low.
Now that is new factual information that we have over the
last few years that puts us in a position to be comfortable
with the SNQ standard, both because we have become successful
at implementing it, and because we have shown statistically
that we don't have a high level of these false positives.
We also are cognizant, though, of the higher standard that
has been proposed on the Senate side of a reasonable
likelihood, and that standard does have an advantage built into
it of enabling us to filter out more cases at the threshold and
compress our timescale.
Ms. Lofgren. Well, it might be easier on the office, but it
is going to be harder on the system, and we will see more
matters litigated at more expense to the American economy. It
might be better to give you the resources to deal with it,
wouldn't you say?
Mr. Kappos. Right. That is a fair point. My view is that,
on balance, it is more costly to our economy to have false
negatives.
Ms. Lofgren. Right.
Mr. Kappos. Those are cases where we should be taking a
substantive look at the patent, but we didn't because the
threshold was set too high.
Ms. Lofgren. Right. Well, and right now, I mean, there is
significant disincentive to bring an action because in the
litigation, anything that could have been raised can't be used.
And therefore, I am assuming, just you have got 90 percent
there is a problem, and yet this major disincentive to even
using the system. That if we were to make this more accessible
and give your office the resources to deal with it, that we
would divert a lot of matters that could be dealt with
successfully in this process. Wouldn't you say that is true?
Mr. Kappos. Well, that is right. If I can say that in my
own words also, that I believe there are significant advantages
for patentees who successfully go through the post grant
system--in this case, inter partes review--because of those
estoppel provisions. Those estoppel provisions mean that your
patent is largely unchallengeable again by the same party.
Ms. Lofgren. Right.
Mr. Kappos. And so, there is a tremendous disincentive
already built in against bringing frivolous inter parte----
Ms. Lofgren. I am going to interrupt because I am almost
out of time, and I want to ask you just one final question. The
engineers have talked to me about third-party submission of
prior art. A lot of them think that may be the most important
part of this bill. It is an open-sourcing patent information.
But it looks like there is evidence that patent examiners
already ignore a lot of information except what they find
through their own search. If we have third-party submission of
prior art that is vigorous and reenergized, how are you going
to get your examiners to actually accept that information, take
it seriously, and utilize it in a way that would optimize the
submissions?
Mr. Kappos. Right. Well, that is a question of training,
coaching, and incentives, and we are engaged in those very
processes because we want our examiners to use the best art, no
matter whether it is art they found or whether it is art that
came in from some other source.
We have found, however, in the pilot that we are currently
running on this third-party review system that the examiners
really enjoy using it and that they are using the prior art
that is coming in. So it may be that having this commentary and
additional help from third parties that they are getting
through the pilot gives examiners that kind of----
Ms. Lofgren. My time is off, and maybe you could send us
some more information on that pilot after the hearing? I would
be very interested.
And I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. The gentleman from Texas, the Chairman
of the Committee, Mr. Smith is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Director Kappos, thank you for being here and also thank
you for your good work at the PTO. It is appreciated by
everybody who knows what you do.
I have two short questions. And if you could give me brief
responses, I am going to yield the balance of my time to the
gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt. And then we will be
able to get you to the airport on time.
First question is this. How do independent inventors and
the smaller entities benefit specifically from this bill? The
independent inventors and the smaller entities, how do they
benefit specifically from this bill?
You talked in general terms. I just wondered if you could
go into more detail?
Mr. Kappos. Sure. Yes, I would be happy to mention that.
Well, first and foremost--well, first anyway, independent
inventors and small entities will benefit, micro entities will
benefit from a new 75 percent discount on the fees that they
pay. Secondly, independent inventors and small entities will
benefit from the USPTO then being able to extend, or the
legislation now extending, 50 percent discounts to new areas
that we are implementing like our Track I examination system,
which will provide 3-month turnaround to first office action
and 1 year to completion of a patent application, which is
something that the independent inventor and small entity
community has been asking us for repeatedly.
We applaud the introduction in this legislation of a 50
percent discount. This gives USPTO the ability to give those
kinds of discounts when we put in place new helpful measures
for that community in the future.
Mr. Smith. Okay. And second question is why should we give
the PTO authority to set the patent fees?
Mr. Kappos. Well, you know, the processes of innovation are
moving so fast, and the different ways that the innovation
community is using our services are changing so fast that we
need, at the USPTO, the ability to adjust our fees to keep up
with what is going on.
Our cost to implement the various services that we perform
change over time and sometimes change rather rapidly. The
amount of demand for services changes, which requires us to put
new infrastructure in place. All of that reflects itself in for
us the cost of doing business, the cost of providing services.
And if we had the ability to adjust our fees, we would be
able to meet the timeframes of the American innovation
community and----
Mr. Smith. The end result is better patents more quickly
approved, I suspect. Okay.
Thank you. I will yield the balance of my time to Mr. Watt.
Mr. Watt. I think I have agreed to submit my questions in
writing in the interest of Mr. Kappos's time. I understand, you
know, he was the first witness. We had to recess for votes, and
so he has got time problems. So I am content with that.
I will yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. The classified briefing is supposed to
end at 3:30 p.m., but usually they don't. So with that in mind,
the Chair is going to recess the Committee, subject to the call
of the Chair for the second panel.
Bon voyage and safe travels, Mr. Kappos. And without
objection, the Committee is recessed, subject to the call of
the Chair.
[Recess.]
Mr. Goodlatte [presiding]. Take three. We have a very
distinguished second panel of witnesses today, and each of the
witnesses' written statements will be entered into the record
in its entirety.
I ask that each witness summarize his testimony in 5
minutes or less. To help you stay within that time, there is a
timing light on your table. When the light switches from green
to yellow, you will have 1 minute to conclude your testimony.
When the light turns red, it signals that the witness's 5
minutes have expired.
Before I introduce our first witness, I would like all of
them to stand and be sworn.
[Witnesses sworn.]
Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you, and be seated.
Our first witness is the Honorable Steve Bartlett. He will
be testifying on behalf of the Financial Services Roundtable in
his capacity as president and CEO. The roundtable is comprised
of 100 integrated financial services companies in the United
States.
Mr. Bartlett has also served as a member of the Dallas City
Council, a Member of Congress, and the Mayor of Dallas. He
founded Meridian Products Corporation, a manufacturer of
injection-molded plastics in 1976, divesting his interest in
1999.
Mr. Bartlett is a graduate of the University of Texas at
Austin, later serving as adjunct professor at the LBJ School of
Public Affairs.
Our next witness is Steven Miller, Procter & Gamble's vice
president and general counsel for intellectual property. He has
worked in a variety of positions for P&G since joining the
company in 1984.
Mr. Miller has authored numerous P&G patents and patent
applications and has participated in interferences,
arbitrations, and litigation in the United States and abroad.
He is a member of many intellectual property organizations and
bar groups. Mr. Miller received his undergraduate and law
degrees from the Ohio State University.
Our next witness is Mark Chandler, senior vice president,
general counsel, and secretary for Cisco. He joined Cisco in
1996 after the company acquired StrataCom, where he served as
general counsel. Earlier in his career, Mr. Chandler was vice
president for corporate development and general counsel for
Maxtor Corporation. Mr. Chandler was educated at Harvard and
Stanford School of Law.
Our final witness is John Vaughn, executive vice president
of the Association of American Universities, whose membership
includes 60 U.S. and 2 Canadian universities with strong
programs of research and graduate and professional education.
Dr. Vaughn has responsibility for association activities in the
area of intellectual property, information technology, research
libraries, and scholarly communication.
Dr. Vaughn received his undergraduate degree from Eastern
Washington State College and his Doctorate in Experimental
Psychology from Minnesota. He was also awarded an NIH Post
Doctoral Traineeship and served as a post doctoral fellow at
Duke.
And I would now like to yield to the gentleman from Ohio,
Mr. Chabot, who would like to also say something about the
witness from Ohio.
Mr. Chabot. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I would like to expound upon the great words that the
Chairman already expressed relative to Mr. Miller. It is
definitely a great honor to introduce one of the witnesses,
Steve Miller.
He is here as vice president and general counsel of
intellectual property for the Procter & Gamble Company, P&G,
which is headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. And Procter &
Gamble has an outstanding record, both locally and globally.
Two small businessmen, William Procter and James Gamble,
founded this company in Cincinnati all the way back in 1837 to
sell candles and soap. Today, the company has grown to include
23 different brand names, with over $1 billion in annual sales
in each.
Procter & Gamble employs 35,000 people throughout the
United States, paying $4 billion in domestic wages annually.
Additionally, P&G provides a positive example of a responsible
charitable corporation, donating approximately $100 million to
charitable organizations every year.
Steve Miller has had a successful career as in-house
counsel with P&G for over 25 years. He is now vice president
and general counsel on intellectual property, where he oversees
approximately 150 patent and trademark attorneys worldwide and
advises P&G's senior management on IP issues.
Mr. Miller has also authored numerous P&G patents and
patent applications and has also been involved in a number of
license agreements, acquisitions, interferences, arbitrations,
and litigation both in the U.S. and abroad.
Mr. Miller is also the current president of the
Intellectual Property Owners Association Education Foundation,
on the Board of Directors and past president of the
Intellectual Property Association, and on the Board of
Directors for the National Inventors Hall of Fame.
I know we look forward to learning more as we hear from Mr.
Miller on patent reform this afternoon and the other witnesses
as well.
And I thank the Chairman greatly for yielding.
Mr. Goodlatte. I thank the gentleman.
Welcome to all of our witnesses, and we will begin with Mr.
Bartlett.

TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE STEVE BARTLETT, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF
EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES ROUNDTABLE

Mr. Bartlett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Watt, Mr. Coble, Mr. Chabot,
it's good to be here.
This is a very important piece of legislation. It's a
legislation that in some ways is long overdue. I commend the
Committee and the present draft, and we're here--I'm here to
support the present draft language of the House version in its
current form.
I'm here to speak on behalf of the Financial Services
Roundtable, as you noted, Mr. Chairman. But I should note up
front that the roundtable has worked closely with other
groups--the American Bankers Association, the Clearing House,
credit unions, the ICBA, the community bankers, NAFCU, SIFMA,
and others--to address this problem of nonpracticing entities
that we believe exploit flaws in the current patent system.
My testimony today is consistent with the views of these
other trades. These nonpracticing entities, Mr. Chairman, or
NPEs, as they're called, have built an industry based on filing
onerous lawsuits involving low-quality business method patents
with the expectation of securing large settlements. These are
widely described as meritless lawsuits and settlements--and the
settlements then help to distort the marketplace.
Fundamental to the operation of the financial services
sector is the interoperability of complex financial systems
that facilitate the movement of data relating to every type of
financial transaction. So it is this network of financial
technology infrastructure that is so fundamental that it has
been designated as a critical national infrastructure by the
Department of Defense.
So given the importance of the financial services sector to
the Nation's economy and infrastructure, it's important that
the patent system work for everyone, and currently, it does
not.
So, instead, the confluence of interoperability, forum
shopping, and a lack of quality prior art, particularly in the
area of business method patents, has conspired to leave
financial firms, from the smallest community banks or local
credit union or insurance agent to the largest global company,
mired in what we believe are meritless litigation over patents
of dubious quality. This litigation has a direct impact on
consumers, as capital that could otherwise be deployed for
business lending in our communities is tied up with court costs
and settlements.
Historically, Mr. Chairman, business methods had not been
patented in any significant quantity. This was profoundly
changed in 1998 by the State Street decision. So between 1997
and 1998, new applications for business method patents tripled
and have tripled again. So by the end of 2009, some 11,000 new
applications for patents on business methods were being filed
each and every year, with 40,000 pending in 2010.
According to a study by Harvard University, the
proliferation of business method patents has resulted in a
flood of patent litigation in the financial services industry,
occurring at a rate of 39 times greater than the patents as a
whole. Now, Mr. Chairman, other than NPEs, there's no
reasonable explanation for a 39 times greater rate of patent
litigation in the financial services industry.
These nonpracticing entities then are increasingly
exploiting the current system to hold hostage entire classes of
industry players in a single lawsuit, and thus,
interoperability comes into play. Neither 90--nearly 90 percent
of infringement cases against the top 20 banks, just as one
data point, name multiple financial services companies as
defendants, often including 20, 40, or even 60 institutions in
a single action.
Now business method patents are not bad, per se, but they
do lend themselves to abuse, given the current system. I could
cite a number of examples. You've probably heard multiple
examples.
One case, scores of banks and insurance companies were sued
in the Eastern District of Texas for infringing on a business
method patent related to marketing. The patents in this suit
covered the printing of marketing materials at the bottom of
the back of billing statements instead of on a separate
statement stuffer. Now it's difficult to see anything novel or
nonobvious in where you print the statement information that
would have merited a patent with a 20-year property right.
The cost to all the sectors of the financial services
industry and our customers continue to grow at an alarming
rate. So, therefore, we support the House draft establishing an
opposition proceeding at the PTO to review qualified business
method patents against a best prior art.
Under this draft legislation, the PTO would determine
whether a patent is qualified, would undertake a review for a
maximum of no more than 1 year, and then, critically, examine
the patent against the best available prior art, including the
evidence of prior use, sale, or offer for sale.
The House bill improves the language related to a stay also
of district court litigation by requiring the Federal Circuit
to review the decision of the lower court de novo. It's our
belief that this stay should be mandatory, but short of it
being mandatory, this de novo language is essential to ensure
that neither plaintiffs nor dependents--nor defendants bear the
cost of parallel proceedings.
Mr. Chairman, with this provision included, we support the
draft bill before the Committee. We would, as an industry,
strongly oppose any efforts to weaken it.
I thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Goodlatte. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Miller, welcome.

TESTIMONY OF STEVEN W. MILLER, VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL
COUNSEL FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY

Mr. Miller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the
Subcommittee. I thank you for the opportunity to---
Mr. Goodlatte. Mr. Miller, you may want to turn on your
microphone.
Mr. Miller. Sorry about that.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you for opportunity to
testify on various aspects of patent law reform.
Although I am active in a number of professional
organizations, I'm appearing today in my capacity as vice
president and general counsel for intellectual property for the
Procter & Gamble Company and its affiliates.
I'm a registered patent attorney with 26 years of patent
law experience, including patent prosecution and litigation.
I've negotiated with individual inventors, universities,
startups, and companies of all sizes.
An essential reform for significantly simplifying the
patent laws is the first inventor to file principle that is
included in H.R. 1249. The adoption of the first inventor to
file principle would make patentability determinations more
transparent, based on objective criteria using publicly
available information. It will benefit all American inventors
and improve their global competitiveness.
H.R. 1249 would also make a number of other improvements in
our patent law and the operation of the patent system.
Curtailing the plague of false marking litigation, providing
adequate funding for the USPTO, limiting the consequences of
the subjective best mode requirement, expanding the
opportunities for the public to submit relevant information to
patent examiners, adding a robust time-limited opportunity to
promptly challenge patents after grant, and providing for
supplemental examination are among the many significant
improvements H.R. 1249 would bring to our patent system.
There are, however, some features of H.R. 1249 that move in
the opposite direction. P&G is concerned that the delicate
compromises reached by numerous stakeholders after years of
negotiations may be upset by a handful of the new provisions in
the bill.
In particular, the following provisions are of such
significance that they may cause stakeholders to withdraw the
support for the bill. First is retaining their threshold for
initiating reviews in second window proceedings.
Under this threshold, 95 percent of all requests are
granted, resulting in a waste of limited USPTO resources. A
higher threshold, a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner
would prevail with respect to at least one claim, is far
preferable.
Second is the addition of a new stay provision to both the
first window and second window post grant procedures. Not only
does listing such stay factors improperly constrain a court's
and the International Trade Commission's freedom to decide the
issue, it overly emphasizes the possibility that a stay should
be granted.
P&G believes a stay should be granted only where it is
clearly appropriate under existing case law as it evolves.
Moreover, the ITC proceedings are designed to be expeditious
and should not be stayed.
Third are three new provisions that have been added to the
transitional program related to financial business method
patents. The transitional program is very controversial and was
agreed among stakeholders only after extensive negotiations.
These new provisions unduly limit venue where an action may be
brought, mandate de novo interlocutory appeals, and impose a
loser pays regime involving such patents.
The injection of a controversial venue provision
reintroduces a debate settled by the Federal Circuit. By also
mandating de novo reviews of stayed decisions and introducing
the highly charged issue of loser pays, H.R. 1249 could very
well change what is at best reluctant acceptance of the
transitional program into outright opposition.
Fourth is the expansion of prior user rights to all
inventions. P&G is concerned that the opposition among various
stakeholders to expanding prior user rights could place in
jeopardy the passage of comprehensive patent reform.
Fifth is the change in time during which the new law issues
post grant review procedure could be initiated. This procedure
was conceived to allow patents to be promptly challenged after
grant on any of the grounds of validity. This procedure should
be as expeditious as possible.
Notwithstanding a growing consensus that 9 months is more
than adequate time, the bill would extend this period by an
additional 3 months to a total of 12 months, adding further
unnecessary delay and uncertainty.
Thank you for the opportunity to present P&G's views. I'd
be pleased to answer any questions.

Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you, Mr. Miller.
Mr. Chandler, welcome.

TESTIMONY OF MARK CHANDLER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, GENERAL
COUNSEL, AND SECRETARY, CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.

Mr. Chandler. Thank you, Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member
Watt, Members of the Subcommittee.
I'm Mark Chandler, senior vice president and general
counsel of Cisco Systems.
I'm here representing technology companies with hundreds of
thousands of employees in the United States and more than
75,000 U.S. patents and patent applications.
I'm here because I believe passionately that our patent
system must not go astray in ways that will weaken our
companies or weaken our country's technology leadership. I have
four specific suggestions to offer regarding the bill before
you. I've also provided a written statement. I'm grateful that
that's being included in the record.
My company is the world's largest manufacturer of
telecommunications equipment that powers the Internet, with
over $40 billion in annual sales and more than 70,000
employees. Three-quarters of our engineers, more than half of
all our employees are here in the United States.
The Coalition for Patent Fairness, for whom I speak today,
includes hundreds of members, such as Apple, Autodesk, Dell,
Google, Intel, Micron, Oracle, RIM, SAP, and Symantec. Our
companies invest tens of billions of dollars in research and
development, and we believe in the patent system.
We understand that the scope for action is limited, given
the passage of S. 23. We also understand that this process is
one of a combination of interests with diverse goals. We
appreciate the work that Senator Leahy did in the Senate in
driving toward patent legislation, though we were unable to
support S. 23 in its final form.
With the suggestions we make today, we hope to be
supporters, rather than opponents, of legislation and to see a
law enacted.
Our four suggestions are as follows. First, hold your
ground on the proposed prior user rights in conjunction with
the move to a first-to-file system. Every developed country on
Earth with a first-to-file system includes prior user rights.
Among U.S. industrial groups, support for prior user rights
is virtually uniform. The AIPLA has testified in favor of prior
user rights, and Gary Griswold, who's with us today, is chair
of the 21st Century Patent Coalition, which sees many issues
differently from the way we do, wrote an article entitled,
``Prior User Rights: A Necessary Part of a First-to-File
System.'' Here is why.
It's not practical to file a patent application on every
change we make to a product. Where we enhance our products in a
way which is unlikely to be copied by a competitor because the
change is specific to our designs, the traditional view is that
a patent makes no sense.
In the current first-to-invent system, no one else could
get a patent that would be valid for those changes either. The
patent would be invalid under 102(g). In a first-to-file system
without prior user rights, however, we can expect patent mills
and competitors here and abroad to file patent applications on
unpatented inventions which they find in our products in order
to hold us hostage, and there's nothing we could do about it.
This is just not fair.
The alternative for us is to rush to massively increase our
patent filings, not to exclude competitors from copying our
products, but to protect ourselves against those who would use
our own inventions against us in court. That would be a totally
unproductive distraction of ours and the PTO's resources.
Director Kappos, in his written testimony, while supporting
prior user rights, states there was no rush to increase filings
in Canada after the switch to a first-to-file system. Of
course, there wasn't. For over a century, Canada has had a
robust prior user rights system. Commend you to section 56 of
the Canadian Patent Act in that regard.
It would be a tragedy if, in a rush to harmonize with the
European and Chinese systems in the wake of the TRIPS accords,
we ignored key protections for manufacturers that virtually
every other country has.
We understand some groups oppose first-to-file in general.
Absent prior user rights, we would join them. We believe the
interests of universities are adequately met by exemptions for
Bayh-Dole and other patents, which you thoughtfully included in
the House legislation. So we strongly support what you've done
in the legislation in that respect.
Second, some changes are needed to the inter partes review
proposals to mitigate aspects of the Senate bill particularly
that are a step backward from current law. The extension of the
time period from 6 months to 9 months after service of
litigation for introducing an inter partes re-exam is laudable.
But a better approach would be to tie the deadline to the
Markman ruling so that the review could reflect the claims
interpretation that the district court made.
Also, if there isn't a mandatory stay, which we would
support, as does the Financial Services Roundtable, we think
that in the four factor test in the bill, the reference to
clear tactical advantage to the moving party as the basis for
denying a stay should be removed. The patent holder's interests
are sufficiently addressed by the requirement that there be no
undue burden.
And also, initiation of a declaratory judgment action on
matters unrelated to an inter partes re-exam should not make it
impossible to introduce an exam.
Our third suggestion is many stakeholders across the
spectrum--and I believe you referred to this, Mr. Chairman--
believe judicial action will obviate the need for the proposed
supplemental review system for cases where patent applicants
have been, shall we say, less than forthcoming with the Patent
Office. We agree.
Nonetheless, if there is to be such a system, we think
minor modifications would immeasurably improve it, and I'm
happy to elaborate on that.
Fourth and finally, this bill presents an appropriate
opportunity to coordinate better between the ITC and the
courts. The bill should require the ITC to follow the Supreme
Court's eBay holding in determining whether to grant an
exclusion order.
With these changes, the bill would meet our minimum needs.
It won't meet all our aspirations. It will reflect what's
possible, given stakeholders with different interests and a
patent system that desperately needs rejuvenation.
Thank you.

Mr. Goodlatte. Mr. Vaughn, welcome.

TESTIMONY OF JOHN C. VAUGHN, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT,
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES

Mr. Vaughn. Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Watt,
Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to
present the views of the university community on H.R. 1249.
Let me begin by saying how much the university community
appreciates the dedication that you and your Judiciary
colleagues have devoted to this extremely important issue.
After more than 6 years, the collective effort is making great
progress toward a balanced set of proposals that, indeed, will
strengthen our present patent system to create jobs at home and
strengthen our economic competitiveness abroad.
Universities use the patent system to license our
inventions to a wide range of private sector companies. In
order for this university technology transfer system to work,
we need a level of patent certainty that will allow our
licensees to develop these discoveries in confidence.
H.R. 1249 includes a number of key provisions that
strengthen patent certainty. Among these are adoption of a
first-inventor-to-file system, which will harmonize the U.S.
patent system with that of our major trading partners; a new
post grant opposition proceeding to challenge patents
immediately after their issuance, eliminating patents that
should not have been granted and strengthening those that
survive the challenge; providing increased resources to the PTO
through expanded fee-setting authority and provisions allowing
the office to retain those fees that it collects; allowing
third parties to submit prior art to the PTO concerning patents
under examination.
However, we have two major concerns with the draft bill.
First, we are very concerned about the broad expansion of prior
user rights. From its origins in the Constitution, the U.S.
patent system has effectively promoted the progress of science
and the useful arts by establishing a quid pro quo of granting
monopoly rights for an invention in return for disclosure to
the public of information about that invention.
Universities believe that expanding prior user rights is an
unwise expansion of immunity from the assertion of patent
rights. Such expansion would reduce patent certainty, and that
reduction in patent certainty would impair university
technology transfer.
We are also concerned about the impact of expanding prior
user rights on academic publishing. While the effective grace
period included in H.R. 1249 would encourage publication by
protecting inventors from others patenting their inventions,
expanding prior user rights would have exactly the opposite
effect.
Early publication would permit others to prepare a
competing trade secret product that could be immune from a
charge of infringement of a patented product or process
emerging from that published research.
We do acknowledge and appreciate the attempt to address
university concerns by providing a legislative carve-out for
university patents under which the prior use defense could not
be applied to university patents arising from Federal or
university funding. While such a carve-out could mitigate the
harmful impact on university licensing, clear problems would
remain.
Many companies to which universities license their patents
intermingle university patents with their own in developing new
products. The commercial prospects for those products would be
at risk with the expansion of prior user rights since it would
increase the vulnerability of nonexempt patents to a prior use
defense by a competitor.
This problem would be especially acute for the small, often
undercapitalized startup companies to which universities
frequently license their inventions.
The second area which we believe needs to be addressed is
the threshold by which an inter partes review can be initiated.
The Senate bill, S. 23, includes two provisions that reduce the
prospect of using the inter partes procedure to mount harassing
serial challenges--first, by expanding the estoppel provisions
to include issues that reasonably could have been raised and,
second, by raising the threshold for initiating an inter partes
review.
The House bill reduces the threshold to the lower current
law standard. We appreciate the retention in the House bill of
the broadened estoppel language, but urge the Judiciary
Committee to reinstate the higher threshold for initiating an
inter partes review.
Universities applaud the many strong provisions that are
contained in H.R. 1249. We hope that we can work with the House
Judiciary Committee and with relevant stakeholders to address
the two concerns raised here so that the recent progress
continues toward a successful completion of this
extraordinarily important endeavor to enact comprehensive
patent reform.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Vaughn follows:]

__________

Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you, Mr. Vaughn.
As everyone can observe, we have 4 minutes and 45 seconds,
now 36 seconds left in this vote. So the Committee will stand
in recess, and we will begin when we return with a brief
opening statement, well into the hearing, from the Ranking
Member of the full Committee and then immediately go into
questions for the witnesses. If you all can remain, we
appreciate your forbearance.
The Committee will stand in recess.
[Recess.]
Mr. Goodlatte [presiding]. The Committee will reconvene for
take four, and we hope this is the last stretch here.
We thank all of you for your patience all afternoon, and I
will recognize myself for questions.
When Ranking Member Conyers gets here, we will allow him to
give his opening statement a little late into the program. But
still welcome.
Let me start with a question for you, Mr. Chandler. How
would you address the concerns of those who argue that an
overexpansion of inter partes would be used to harass
independent inventors and small businesses?
Mr. Chandler. I'm sensitive to that concern. I think it's
extremely important in the inter partes process to strike a
balance between the need to ensure that there is a review
process by which patents that shouldn't have been granted are
looked at and, at the same time, not create undue cost or
burdens or delay for patent holders, whether independent
inventors or otherwise, who have the right to enforce their
patents against those who are infringing.
And striking that balance is not easy, as we've seen in the
process of putting this legislation together. I think there are
several principles that are useful to keep in mind.
First, in the case of litigation, we--there should be a
time period within which an inter partes review is initiated so
that one does not litigate for years, try to get to a
conclusion, and then, all of a sudden, find oneself in another
forum back at the Patent Office.
It's our view that while moving from 6 months to 9 months
in the legislation that's before you today was a move in the
right direction, it's conceptually better to tie it to the
Markman exam because then you have the claims construction as
part of the review.
At the same time----
Mr. Goodlatte. Is that in your testimony, when you said you
had ideas for improving the supplemental exam provision in the
bill, is that some other ideas you have there as well?
Mr. Chandler. Yes, on supplemental exam, I understand the
concerns you raise about the process as a whole, given judicial
action. But right now, it says that if supplemental--you can't
use the results of a supplemental exam in pending litigation.
We think that a supplemental exam procedure that also said you
can't use a supplemental exam to cure a problem if you've been
actively pursuing nonexclusive licensees in a way that would
allow the potential licensee to file a DJ against you, you
shouldn't be able to seek the supplemental exam in that case
either.
So that people don't go out and start licensing programs to
collect money on a patent where they know they weren't
forthcoming, and then only when they're faced with litigation
do they go in and cure the problem. But with that kind of
modification, I think we could move forward with that
supplemental exam.
Mr. Goodlatte. Mr. Vaughn, can you speak to the
universities' perspective on the prior user rights provision
that includes an absolute exemption for universities and
technology transfer organizations? And what changes would you
make?
Mr. Vaughn. Well, I--changes--there are some changes I
think that could be made that----
Voice. Push your microphone button.
Mr. Vaughn [continuing]. Would improve it. But I think our
broader concern is just the impact on the system overall,
independent of a university carve-out. The concern we have
about a carve-out is that it would not cover, say, privately
funded university patents, and frequently, funding for research
projects includes a mix of Federal, university, and private
funds.
We are also very concerned about the issue I mentioned of
the intermingling of patents that would be exempt in a carve-
out with patents in a product that wouldn't be exempt. And
particularly, the concern about the impact of expanded prior
user rights on the startups that often emerge out of university
research that wouldn't be touched by in their own IP with--with
a university carve-out.
So I mean, I think I want to be clear that----
Mr. Goodlatte. You are clear, and I need to get one more
question in here with my time.
Is the shift from first-to-invent to first inventor to file
constitutional? And I will ask any of you this question. Is it
true that our current filing system was created through the
1952 act and has not necessarily been the same since our
Nation's founding?
Anybody want to take a stab at that? Mr. Miller?
Mr. Miller. I'll be happy to, Mr. Chairman.
The Constitution says that the Congress shall grant to
inventors, and a first-inventor-to-file system also includes
that that person is an inventor. They are an inventor of the
technology, and so it would be within the Constitution.
In fact, all of the studies that we've had since 1965 on
haven't questioned the constitutionality of a first inventor to
file provision. So I don't think that there's a real issue here
at all because it's just a procedural mechanism as to determine
who gets the rights as an inventor.
Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you.
The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt, is recognized.
Mr. Watt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Miller, I identified several issues that you and Mr.
Bartlett and Mr. Chandler were at odds about, and I probably
have forgotten some of them. But I do remember this whole stay
provision was one of them.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to give us your
perspective on it, and then I would ask Mr. Chandler and Mr.
Bartlett to do the same and see if there is some way we can
reconcile what the three of you all are saying. I am in the
reconciliation business, as you have probably gathered by now.
Mr. Miller. Thank you, Mr. Watt.
You know, I think we're in the reconciliation business,
too, and we've done a lot to try to get there. My concerns are
by both lowering the standard for getting into an inter partes
re-exam and really putting these stay provisions that a court
has to look at, that we allow abuse by serial infringers to
come in and try to delay proceedings by taking the lower
threshold, finding a new question of patentability, and then
slowing down the litigation process as much as possible so that
we don't get a quick resolution that Mr. Chandler was
mentioning.
So that's my concern is that the combination of those two
are going to give an advantage to an infringer to the detriment
of patentees that need to quickly assert their patent rights.
Mr. Watt. And Mr. Chandler, and then I want to go back to
Mr. Miller to see whether there is--well, you tell me what you
have to say on this, and then I will listen to Mr. Bartlett.
But at the end of this, my ultimate question is, is there a way
to reconcile where the three of you are on this issue?
Mr. Chandler. Well, first of all, one of the key provisions
in the currently considered legislation is--and this goes along
with the funding for the Patent Office and the ability to keep
the fees that we users of the system pay--is a commitment that
re-exams will be completed within 12 months. And that's a very
important part of the Administration of the re-exam process
that is covered here. So we're not talking about a long delay.
We're talking about coordinating processes between different
bodies that have responsibility here.
Our view of the stay provision is four factors is the right
number of factors if you don't make it an automatic stay. The
provision bill is for a short-term stay to begin with, only
through the period of the re-exam anyway.
If we were going to have four factors, we'd keep four
factors. But on one of them, it says that there has to be a
finding there is no undue burden to the patent holder and no
clear tactical advantage to the movant. We simply want to say
no undue burden to the patent holder because we think that
standard of clear tactical advantage can be used by any judge
to deny a stay since, obviously, there is an advantage to
having a stay because you avoid getting a district court making
a finding that's inconsistent with what the Patent Office is
doing. That's why you're seeking the stay, and that's why
you've sought the re-exam.
So that's mine.
Mr. Watt. All right. We are going to come back and
reconcile this in a little bit.
Mr. Bartlett?
Mr. Bartlett. Mr. Watt, in the efforts----
Mr. Watt. I am so used to seeing you over in Financial
Services, I am feeling like you are out of place over here.
Mr. Bartlett. I've been all over. It's my hope at the
conclusion of the hearing that we will--we will see you as an
original cosponsor of the legislation, Mr. Watt, as you started
off at the beginning.
In an attempt to reconcile, first of all, it's my opinion,
it's my belief that what we're talking about, which is the
business method patent, is not applied to the topic of--the
other topic of the mandatory stay. So this is carved out
specifically for this.
The reason I think it is reconciled is that at least we had
believed and still believe that the right answer would be a
mandatory stay, an automatic stay, and we were not able to
convince the bill's sponsors of that. So, absent that, then a
stay that is a de novo stay would make it work.
Without a de novo stay, it would be a meaningless right.
Our attorneys have looked through the records, and without a de
novo stay, it would revert to an abuse of discretion standard,
and we can find no civil litigation which an abuse of
discretion standard has been applied to apply for a stay. So we
think that the--that the de novo stay is essential to make this
work. Otherwise, it just doesn't work.
Mr. Watt. Why did I think the whole financial services
community would be on the opposite side of business methods
stuff? I thought the financial institutions would be the ones
that would be developing business methods rather than the ones
that were being attacked by these business methods patents, and
I was just absolutely off base on that, I found out after I
started studying this issue.
Mr. Bartlett. Mr. Watt, this is a serious, serious issue
for the financial services industry. It's overwhelmingly----
Mr. Watt. I shouldn't have gone there. That is all right. I
ran out of time. I need to get this reconciled. That is another
issue. I will talk to you about that one off record.
Reconcile you all's positions for me. Is there some way to
reconcile?
Mr. Miller. I'm not sure. We're going to have to sit down,
and maybe you can help us with that, Mr. Watt.
Mr. Watt. All right.
Mr. Chandler. I think you might ask Mr. Kappos as well. I
spent a good part of February locked in a room with Under
Secretary Kappos, with the general counsel of the Commerce
Department, and with one of my counterparts who is the general
counsel of a large pharmaceutical company. And some of the
language that Under Secretary Kappos has circulated was a
reflection of those discussions, where we tried to be very,
very reasonable in coming up with an approach that would----
Mr. Watt. I take it that is not in the Chairman's bill?
That is not the language that is in the----
Mr. Chandler. It's not precisely, but we're happy to work
further on that.
Mr. Watt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm sorry----
Mr. Goodlatte. No problem. I thank the gentleman.
I now recognize the gentlewoman from Florida, Mrs. Adams,
who does not have a question. We now yield to the Chairman of
the full Committee, Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, first of all, I would like to thank all of
our witnesses because they directly or indirectly had an impact
and a positive impact on this bill. And we sat down, either
with you all individually or with the organizations you
represented, and appreciate your being willing to work with us.
Mr. Bartlett, let me direct my first question to you, which
is going to be an easy question. I appreciate a former
colleague being with us today as well.
You touched upon this in your opening statement. But
basically, I just would like for you to say specifically how
some provisions in this bill positively impact financial
institutions. And since I wasn't here for all of Mr. Watt's
questions, maybe he already asked you that. And if so, we can
fast forward to the next one.
But if you could be specific about how you find this bill
helpful, that would be good.
Mr. Bartlett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Because the current law gums up the system particularly
because it's interoperable. It involves multiple institutions
all engaged in answering a telephone or check imaging or--so
it's all interoperable. So they all get sued, basically, and
the system just kind of stops without some kind of protection
for a post grant review.
So what this draft legislation does is it provides a post
grant review based on these new factors as a way of reviewing
prior art to determine if it should be a valid patent or not.
And without that, then, in essence, our companies end up just
settling because of the enormous cost of litigation and the
threat of losing because the odds are stacked against them.
They can't get a review as to whether it's a valid patent in
the first place.
So this legislation for our section of it allows a valid--a
review that's a valid review of whether it's a valid patent.
Mr. Smith. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Bartlett.
Mr. Miller, let me ask you a question. You are with Procter
& Gamble, and you represent a certain segment of companies in
America, in fact, a very large segment of companies in America.
How does the bill positively impact you all? And if you could
be specific, that would be helpful, too.
Mr. Miller. Sure. Absolutely, Mr. Chairman, thank you.
The bill positively affects us because we deal with a lot
of small inventors. We deal with universities. We have an open
innovation program that I'd referred to my written testimony.
And the first-inventor-to-file system is going to make our
system more transparent, able for us to make better decisions
on whether we're going to be willing to invest capital.
It also lets us get rid of the poorer patents, the poorer-
quality patents that come out of the Patent Office, through a
post grant review proceeding and even, if necessary, an inter
partes review proceeding. It fixes the false marking problem
that many of our companies have been subjected to, and it also
allows the Patent Office to get full funding.
The Patent Office needs full funding to do its job, but it
also needs these other tools. And so, I think those are the key
provisions of this bill that are going to help all of us
throughout the United States spur innovation and create more
jobs.
Mr. Smith. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Miller.
Mr. Vaughn, let me jump to you and say as a preliminary
statement that the goal in drafting this bill--during the
entire process of researching, talking, negotiating, and
developing--was not to get a bill that is going to make people
necessarily 100 percent happy. Because if you do that, you also
have a lot of people who are zero percent happy.
Now the goal to me was to try to get most people about 60
to 70 percent happy and have them emphasize the positive rather
than the 30 percent where they were unhappy.
We have done a lot in this legislation that I think is
beneficial to the university communities, and I understand that
they are not entirely happy. But they certainly should be
appreciative of the carve-out that they received, which might
be looked upon as benefitting them more than some others might
benefit.
But I would like to ask you a similar question, which is in
what ways do you see the university community benefited by this
bill? And even though you may not approve of it 100 percent, I
would like to suggest that at least it is about 70 percent
helpful to the communities.
And I did hear your opening statement. I understand the
three or four points that you would like for us to take a
further look at. But if you would, in this instance, tell me
the positive aspects of the bill?
Mr. Vaughn. I'd be happy to, Mr. Smith.
I think, first of all, that universities will benefit----
Mr. Goodlatte. Mr. Vaughn, you need to turn your microphone
on.
Mr. Vaughn [continuing]. Directly or indirectly from
provisions that strengthen the system overall. So even though
it is not directly to the universities, increasing resources to
the PTO is going to be enormously helpful to everybody.
In 2005 when the decision was made to incorporate first
inventor to file, we spent a lot of time working with this
Committee, working with other stakeholders to adjust the grace
period, which is so critical to university publishing, and that
has been fit perfectly to a first inventor to file. That will
be an enormous benefit for universities.
We think that the new post grant opposition procedure will
be very useful. We won't use it. Universities don't very often
get into court, litigate their own patents. But I think it's
going to be very helpful to our startups. Sometimes it will be
that their patents will be challenged, but if they're solid
patents, coming through that is going to give them a
strengthened patent going forward.
And we think that the--the third-party input of information
during a patent examination is going to be helpful. We've
actually been working with IBM on trying to find ways to
organize the graduate students, engineers, law students to
organize systematic input to the patent system for providing
better information. That's going to improve the quality of
patents, and that will help as well.
Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Vaughn.
To me, the standard against which this bill is measured is
the status quo, not necessarily the ideal. And to the extent
that it is better than the status quo, then I would argue that
it deserves support. So I appreciate your comments.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Goodlatte. I thank the Chairman, and I am now pleased
to recognize the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Lofgren.
Ms. Lofgren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Goodlatte. Oh, I am sorry. If you would suspend, I have
forgotten I promised the Ranking Member that he could make a
unanimous consent request.
Mr. Watt. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to submit
for the record a letter from our former colleague Steve
Largent, dated March 29, 2011. He is now the president and CEO
of the CTIA Wireless Association. A statement of Brian Fontes,
dated March 30, 2011, and a 3-page statement from Claudio
Ballard.
Mr. Goodlatte. Without objection, it will be made a part of
the record.
[The information referred to follows:]

__________
Prepared Statement of Claudio Ballard, Inventor and Entrepreneur

__________

Mr. Goodlatte. And the gentlewoman is recognized.
Ms. Lofgren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I will be brief, as this is the end of a long day, but
not the end of a very long process that goes back. I think I
first started working on this in 1997, and I think all of us
here have been working on this for--well, except for the new
parties, but really this has been more than a decade's work.
And we have made tremendous progress.
As the Chairman knows, I am not yet a cosponsor of this
bill because I think there are a few areas where we could
improve it even further. And I say that certainly without
criticism of the Chairman of the Committee, who has worked
tirelessly with me and the others for over a decade to get to
where we are today.
I believe, listening to Mr. Chandler and the work that Mr.
Kappos has put into this, I would like to see what kind of
resolution was reached. Obviously, you don't bind anybody else.
You are just one general counsel and general counsel for some
company and the patent commissioner.
But I sense that the defects here could be resolved by the
stakeholders in a way that would work for everyone. And so, I
am really eager to work with Mr. Smith and Mr. Goodlatte to see
if we can't take that one step further.
I also think that--and nobody has really mentioned the
inequitable conduct provisions here, but I think we need a
little more work there, honestly. I certainly don't want to
give a broad grant of immunity to people, license to lie to the
Patent Office. And I think that we could tweak the provisions
here and make some improvements, and I think we would all be
satisfied if we did that.
On the first-to-file, I realize there are other challenges
that we will face in the House on the whole first-to-file
issue. Not every person in America thinks it is a good idea.
But if we are going to have first-to-file, clearly we have to
have adequate prior user rights, and I think someone mentioned
that the only country that doesn't have prior user rights with
first-to-file is Cyprus, hardly a role model for the United
States.
As you know, I come from Silicon Valley, and I got an email
this morning. And I won't read the whole thing, but it is from
the general counsel of Stanford University. And she says,
``Universities in general are very supportive of the bill,
appreciating the comprehensive reform with first-to-file. We
know that some universities are opposed to any expansion of
prior user rights, even with the carve-out for university
inventions derived from federally sponsored research. However,
Stanford is satisfied with the current language. The most
important thing is to get the reform bill passed with the
first-to-file and not have the bill die because of a dispute
with high-tech companies over prior user rights, which would
leave us with the status quo.''
So I think it is very significant that Stanford, with its
enormous patent portfolio, has been willing to step forward and
say let's do this, understanding that, as the Chairman has
said, nothing is necessarily perfect. But I am satisfied with
this statement from Stanford that we have struck the right
balance there.
I was a little bit concerned, Mr. Vaughn, about your
testimony about publishing, and I am having a hard time
understanding the point that you have made. I don't see how
prior user rights could create problems for academic
publishing.
Publication within the 1-year grace period for the filing
would be protected from any prior use during that period, and a
company could not get a prior use right for something that was
started in response to a publication in the grace period. And
if the publisher published outside of the 1-year grace period,
then the publication would become prior art that would prevent
the idea from being patented in the first place.
So I am seeking to understand your point. And because if it
were a chill on publication, obviously that would be of concern
to all of us. Can you explain?
Mr. Vaughn. Well, I think, Congresswoman, that, absent a
carve-out, there is concern that the timing could be such and
with the murky sort of records of trade secret processes that
you could publish something that would give somebody an idea,
and they could develop that based on work that they had already
started----
Ms. Lofgren. I see.
Mr. Vaughn [continuing]. And be able to show that they had
developed the product within the time period. Having a carve-
out would help that, although it wouldn't account for privately
funded.
Ms. Lofgren. I see that my time has expired, Mr. Chairman.
I think, if I would just ask--I don't want to get in a debate.
But I think the terms of the bill itself protect against the
concern that you have expressed and would urge a further review
of the language.
And I would yield back with my intention to work further
with the Chairman of the Committee. I think that we can get to
where we need to be, and I, for one, am willing to continue to
work on it.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Goodlatte. The Chair thanks the gentlewoman and thanks
her for her commitment to this legislation.
And I am now pleased to recognize the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, Mr. Marino, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Marino. Thank you, Chairman.
Congressman, knowing that I have 5 minutes, my colleague,
the Ranking Member, started to ask a question, and I am going
to ask my question and perhaps you can elaborate on it and
expand on it for a minute or two because I have another follow-
up.
I notice a small, but significant difference between the
House and the Senate bills that I would like for you to
discuss. Under section 18 of the House bill, the standard of
review for the interlocutory appeals is stronger, providing
that the Federal Circuit shall review de novo the district
court's decision to ensure consistent application of the
established precedent.
Can you describe the significance of this and why it is
important?
Mr. Bartlett. Well, the reason--first of all, the
fundamental reason it's important why the stay can be granted
is because, otherwise, you're in two venues at once, and it
gums up the whole works. So the post grant review becomes
meaningless or at least more costly.
There have been several iterations. The iteration that came
from the other body in the Committee, the Senate Judiciary
Committee, was a mandatory stay of litigation, which was what
we think ought to happen. That didn't survive the full body,
and the draft legislation in front of you has a satisfactory
solution, not as good as a mandatory stay, but it does have a
solution that is, as I said earlier, that is a de novo appeal.
So we think if it's a de novo appeal, then a stay will be
granted when it's warranted.
Without a de novo appeal, though, then it reverts to what's
called an abuse of discretion, where to get a stay, you have to
prove an abuse of discretion, and we find that to be--I find
that to be, in my terms, a meaningless standard. It just simply
cannot be achieved, and we haven't found it achieved anywhere
else.
So we think that mandatory would be better. But with four
factors and a de novo appeal, we think that works just fine.
Mr. Marino. And my last question, I understand and support
the goals of section 18 of the bill, which establishes a
transitional review proceeding at PTO where certain financial
service business methods, method patents can be examined. I
also understand that the point of the transitional review
program is to weed out spurious or invalid patents at an early
stage.
My concern is in regards to certain patents that have, one,
already been litigated to a jury verdict and found to be valid
and/or, two, if the Patent Office has already completed a full
re-examination of that particular patent and found it to be
valid. Can you explain to me why it would be either fair or
good policy to subject the transitional program in section 18
to a patent that has been found valid through ex parte re-
examination or a full jury trial?
Is there room for some sort of limits on how far back or
which patents this transitional program can reach so that we
aren't relitigating and reevaluating patents that have been
found again and again to be valid?
Mr. Bartlett. In layman's terms, because this--this post
grant review process would be the first--would be the first
review under these terms, and the other processes that occurred
didn't occur under these terms. So we think that this is a
program to be administered by the Patent Office, and the Patent
Office would do a post grant review based on prior art for 1
year, and we think it would help to clear out the system, as
well as establish these new valid reviews.
So we don't think in those cases where there's been a prior
review that it would obviate the need for this review.
Mr. Marino. Mr. Miller, could you add anything to that?
Mr. Miller. Well, I think it's just one more delay. If a
court's already adjudicated the issue, I don't know why we'd
want to go back to the Patent Office under this transitional
provision and subject that person to another round of review.
It seems like a waste of time and effort on both parties' side.
You know, this isn't a good use of resources of the PTO or of
the court.
Mr. Marino. Thank you, and I yield my time, Chairman.
Mr. Goodlatte. Thank the gentlemen, and the Chair yields to
the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Deutch for 5 minutes.
Mr. Deutch. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I would like to just continue that line of questions. I
appreciate the hearing very much, Mr. Chairman, and there were
a number of questions I wanted to ask. But since this last
exchange reminds me of a specific situation with a Floridian, I
would like to actually walk through, and I always find it
helpful if there is some detail, some real-life experiences to
draw on instead of speaking only in the abstract.
So, if I may, Mr. Chairman, let me just share the story of
Claudio Ballard, who, in the mid 1990's, Claudio, who is a
Floridian, had an invaluable idea that would improve businesses
in the United States by replacing paper with electronic images.
The change would save business money by being more efficient,
promote faster processing.
He built a prototype of the computer system that would put
his idea into effect. He showed the prototype to investors,
began raising money to put the idea into effect, and filed
patent applications to protect his idea and the invention.
Once the patent applications were filed, numerous companies
began expressing interest in the invention. One industry that
showed particularly strong interest in the product was the
banking industry, which, Mr. Bartlett, is why I would like to
focus on this particular example.
Claudio met with the industry and demonstrated that his
invention could remove paper checks from the payment process
and replace them with electronic images, change that could
potentially save the industry billions of dollars. In an effort
to protect his invention, he signed contracts that he thought
would prevent his products that were still pending for patents
from being taken without his permission.
As time went on, he was unable to sell his invention to any
banks. He founded a company to raise capital, attempt to sell
his invention. However, he became aware that the reason he
couldn't sell the invention was because many banks had already
decided to use the invention themselves without paying his
company even one penny.
Now because Claudio had patents on his product, he filed
lawsuits in Federal court against the banks for infringing on
his patents. In response to the lawsuits, there was an effort
made by the banks to invalidate the patents. First, a request
that the Patent Office conduct a re-examination and strike the
patents. The courts delayed the litigation during the 2 years
that the Patent Office re-examined them, and ultimately, they
found the patents were validated.
Next, one bank decided to continue to pursue the
litigation, and last year, a jury verdict, after reviewing all
of the evidence in the case, rendered a decision that the
patents were valid. Jury also found the patents were being
willfully infringed by the banks. And so, after 8 years, when
the first lawsuit was filed, many of the banks have licensed
his patents. They are using the technology he invented, and
they are paying his company royalties for the use of the
product.
So now, drawing back to today's hearing, section 18 of the
legislation is a transitional program for business method
patents. And again, this is following up on the last line of
questioning. And while I fully support, Mr. Chairman, the
purpose of section 18 and the creation of a transitional
program to weed out invalid and poor-quality patents from the
old system, I have got real concerns that the scope of the
section could, in effect, invalidate patents that have been
found valid by a jury in our court system.
And so, Mr. Bartlett, just now having added some
specificity to this line of questions, if the purpose of the
section, section 18 is to target invalid patents, why is it--
and I wasn't clear in your response, your last response--why is
it that in cases in which a patent has already been re-examined
by the Patent Office and found to be valid, and that it has
been found valid by a jury, why should these patents be
included within the scope specifically of this section 18
review?
And aren't we invalidating Federal court decisions and
giving losing litigants--in the case of Claudio, the banking
industry--another try at invalidating patents that have already
been found valid by a jury and by the Patent Office?
Mr. Bartlett. Well, first, this section only applies to
business method patents and not to other patents, and it could
well be that that was not a business method patent. But
secondly----
Mr. Deutch. Let us assume that it is.
Mr. Bartlett. Then for the record, I might be able to offer
additional for the record on that. But, and the answer is
because without this, then there has not been a post grant
review based on best prior art. So perhaps a lot of other
things were taken into account by the court or by the Patent
Office, but there was never an authorization to examine it
against best prior art.
So we think that what is needed here to clear out the
system and to stop what is clearly to us the abuse is a review
against best prior art. And that has not been permitted in
prior cases.
Mr. Deutch. Mr. Chairman, if I could ask the other
witnesses, if there is in a situation like this where the
patent has been re-examined, a thorough examination by the
Patent Office, are they precluded from looking at prior? Is
there anything in that review that is problematic in a system
that has existed now and has provided for this sort of thorough
review? If someone else could speak to this?
Mr. Miller. I'll be happy to try, Congressman.
I think this is the whole balancing issue that we have to
really address with these provisions. We don't want to have
legitimate inventions given to infringers to have second,
third, and fourth bites at the apple. And unfortunately, this
transitional provision, even though it's limited to narrow
business method patents for financial institutions, in essence,
gives a second or third bite at the apple to folks that have
had to go through other processes.
And I think it's a good idea perhaps to look at building an
estoppel, just like we built an estoppel into the post grant
review and inter partes re-exam procedure.
Mr. Deutch. Mr. Chairman, I just would hope, as we move
forward, that we look at different ways to create some sort of
estoppel system for patents that have already been through re-
examination by the office, found to be valid, and found to be
valid by a court of law as well.
I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Goodlatte. Good point. Thank you, Mr. Deutch.
The gentleman from New York, Mr. Reed, is recognized for
his questions.
Mr. Reed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, gentlemen, for your testimony today.
I just want to focus on one area in particular. I have
looked at some of the statistics and reports from the PTO, and
I have concerns. When we see that inter partes reviews are
successful 90 percent of the time either invalidating or
narrowing the patents, ex parte reviews are successful 77
percent of the time, you know, that begs the question to me why
are we adding an additional administrative proceeding when it
comes to post grant review?
But I think that has already come and gone, and that battle
seems to be behind us, and we are moving forward on it. So I
guess I raise the question about whenever we add a proceeding
that can be utilized by litigation tactics and things like
that, I am very sensitive to frivolous, exposing it to
frivolous claims.
I am familiar with one that was sent to our office. One
group called the ``patent assassins,'' I have shared that
information with Members of the Committee and others, where
they market, in my opinion, their business model is to attack
patents on a frivolous nature to essentially, my opinion, shake
people down and corporations down for financial purposes.
But could you, I guess, Mr. Miller, I will direct the
question to you. Could you just clarify or add your experience
or testimony as to abuses you have seen with the existing inter
partes system? It may be helpful to the----
Mr. Miller. Yes, we had one particular--thank you for the
question, Congressman Reed.
We had one particular case that we brought that was a
pretty egregious infringement on a packaging for our Folger's
coffee can, and we asked for a preliminary injunction. And the
response was by the alleged infringer to immediately run to the
Patent Office and ask for an inter partes re-exam and then ask
for a stay in the proceeding in the district court.
And so, the whole litigation tactic was let's open a second
front, where we can have a second bite at the apple against
this, get the original litigation stayed, try to avoid a
preliminary injunction, and then move forward.
Well, we took an appeal to that to the Federal Circuit. The
Federal Circuit reversed and said you have to decide the
preliminary injunction motion. You can't just stay the
proceedings, and that's one of my concerns with stays. And lo
and behold, the case settled after the court said that they
had--we had to have a preliminary injunction hearing because
the other party knew that they would probably be enjoined from
further using the invention.
So, you know, I think that there are litigation abuses and
litigation tactics that we have to control and have to be
sensitive as we develop the procedures in this bill.
Mr. Reed. Well, and that is where I look at the Senate
bill, and I see higher thresholds for the post grant review and
inter partes review language in those bills. I guess from your
experience, would you see those helping to reduce that higher
threshold, reducing those frivolous actions and abuses that you
may have described there?
Mr. Miller. I do. I do. I think that----
Mr. Reed. And why is that? Why would that work?
Mr. Miller. Well, I think that we see a lot of times
where--and I say any good patent attorney worth its salt can
find a new question of patentability by finding some reference
that wasn't cited at the Patent Office. We ought to hold folks
to the standard that there is a reasonable likelihood that one
claim is going to be invalid in the patent, and that ensures
that there is actually something amiss with the patent, that
there needs to be a correction that needs to be made.
And so, that we can go forward with the assurance of using
all the resources that the PTO is going to use within this
quick 1-year timeframe with all the estoppels to get this
through and make sure that that problem is fixed. If we go to
the lower standard, we may get to the point where we've gone
through this whole procedure, and there are no problems. And
that's wasting not only PTO resources, but both of the parties'
time.
And that's why I think the higher threshold is extremely
important in these.
Mr. Reed. I understand, Mr. Chandler, you may have a
different opinion on this issue. But do you see any risk to the
post grant review process being opened up, if we lower the
threshold or even went lower? I think in your testimony, you
wanted to go lower on the threshold. Do you see any risk of
that frivolous abuse that Mr. Miller is referring to?
Mr. Chandler. No, we--we're actually not in favor of
lowering the threshold. We're in favor of maintaining current
law, which is----
Mr. Reed. Okay.
Mr. Chandler [continuing]. The question of patentability.
Mr. Reed. Which is a lower threshold than what the Senate
bill has?
Mr. Chandler. It is. But under the current threshold, the--
there have been 1,115 inter partes re-exams since 1999, when
the procedure was implemented. In 89 percent of the cases, at
least one claim was invalidated. In 47 percent of the cases--
that's almost half of them--the patent itself was thrown out
completely.
So when you have 89 percent subject to change, and Mr.
Miller advised me during the recess that about a quarter of
those may have been more administrative fixes to patents, even
if a quarter of them were that, when you get that level of
result, it would seem that the threshold doesn't need to be
raised.
And I think Director Kappos spoke directly to the question
of whether it would be a use of resources, distraction of
resources to leave the threshold where it is, and he seemed
comfortable with that, given those percentages.
Mr. Reed. So, essentially, you are saying the existing
system works. Why go to the post grant review, if I am
understanding your testimony correctly?
Mr. Chandler. And this, actually, is very relevant to the
question Mr. Deutch posed a moment ago because the types of
information that are allowed in as part of the re-exam are
different under the post grant review, which is only available
in the first year after issuance.
Mr. Reed. Okay.
Mr. Chandler. Once you get past that, inter partes is a
very narrowly constrained type of information that can be
looked at related to other patents and published prior art. So
they are different.
I would suggest coordinating them so that if someone wanted
to start an inter partes review immediately after the patent
granted, if litigation, for instance, was brought at that
point, that the director could consolidate post grant and inter
partes requests so that you don't have duplicative proceedings
on the same patent. I think that would be a procedural
improvement to the structure of what's in the legislation
today.
Mr. Reed. Thank you.
I see my time has expired. I will yield back. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you, Mr. Reed.
The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Chu, is recognized for
her questions.
Ms. Chu. Thank you.
Mr. Chandler, in his testimony, Mr. Miller characterized
the changes to the inter partes process in the Senate bill as
``safeguards.'' Do you agree with his characterization, and do
you think the changes actually make the inter partes process
more fair and less burdensome?
Mr. Chandler. Actually, I think that the Senate bill's
provisions on inter partes are a step backward compared to
current law. As Chairman Smith alluded to in his opening
statement, there is an issue that affects technology community,
particularly related to frivolous lawsuits. And that inter
partes review is a major step that is used in order to have the
Patent Office look at unmeritorious patents and invalidate them
where required with the very high statistics that I cited.
So I don't think it makes it more fair, and I think
certainly some of the changes that are reflected in the draft
legislation today fix some of that, don't go quite far enough,
and that's why I suggested a couple of other modifications that
could move us to the position of being enthusiastic supporters
of the bill.
I would say that the opportunity provided by the unusual
schedule this afternoon facilitated a number of sidebar
conversations during the recesses, and I think we're making
progress on some of these issues.
Ms. Chu. Mr. Chandler, under the House bill, defendants
would have only 9 months to file a request for inter partes re-
exam after getting sued. What is the deadline under current
law? Do you believe a deadline is necessary or actually
improves the inter partes process?
Mr. Chandler. There is no deadline under current law, but
I'm sensitive to the fact that patent holders ought to get some
certainty with respect to their patents and be able to proceed
with litigation. The commitment in the legislation having a 1-
year period for inter partes review is very important for
patent holders, and we're supportive of that requirement and
the funding that facilitates it.
I think a time limit is a good idea. I think it is better
calculated by the Markman examination, Markman determination by
the judge rather than by an arbitrary time period. We have some
litigation that involved tens of defendants, 61 patents, 1,975
different claims, this past litigation which you may be
familiar with. And in those cases, it is very, very hard prior
to Markman to figure out how to initiate an inter partes
review.
And that would, I think, cause the patent holder as well to
want to speed up the Markman so that there would be a clear
claim interpretation. But we do not object to the idea that
there should be a limiting event or time.
Ms. Chu. Mr. Miller?
Mr. Miller. I'd just like to comment on one thing Mr.
Chandler said. Waiting to a Markman hearing can be way too
late. Some courts don't even hold a Markman hearing until maybe
a week or so before the trial, and so you've already gone
through discovery. You've already gone through getting ready
for the trial, and then to file for an inter partes re-exam
that late in the game just isn't fair to some patentees.
And so, our district courts vary on the times when Markman
hearings are held. So I think it's a better policy to have a
date certain as to when these have to be filed.
Ms. Chu. Mr. Chandler, how do you respond to that?
Mr. Chandler. As someone who is most often a defendant in
these litigations, we do not find it advantageous to have the
Markman hearing wait to before trial for exactly the judicial
inefficiency aspects that Mr. Miller alluded to. And I think
that with a change such as I proposed, both plaintiff and
defendant would have an interest in pushing for a faster
Markman proceeding, and that would have an impact then on the
pace with which the district courts handle that.
Ms. Chu. Okay. And just switching topics, Mr. Vaughn, as
you know, some startup companies, small businesses and
independent inventors and universities are concerned that the
grace period in the House and Senate bills may force them to
publicly disclose their technology before they are ready to
enter the marketplace.
Do you agree with this concern? Do you have recommendations
for ways to improve the grace period to ensure that the patent
system works for all inventors?
Mr. Vaughn. Well, I've heard a lot of expressions about the
grace period that suggest to me that there may not be a full
understand of the changes that have been made. Because the
grace--the grace period that is in the current legislation is
fit to move to a first inventor to file, such that the
publications of an inventor provide a 12-month period for that
person to file a patent application, and that person's
publication is not prior art. But it would be prior art for
someone else trying to file a patent.
So I think you've kind of carved out a space to give
yourself time, if you're a startup company, to explore the
marketability of your patent, and the grace period protects
that time.
Ms. Chu. Okay. Thank you, and I yield back.
Mr. Goodlatte. Thank you, Ms. Chu.
I think that concludes our questions today, which also
brings the hearing to an end.
And want to thank you all for your very helpful testimony.
It has been very instructive. Who knows? We may have even made
some progress.
And Mr. Chandler, if we can't make everybody enthusiastic,
maybe we can at least make everybody feel better, and we will
take that as a victory as well.
So thank you again very much. I appreciate your testimony,
appreciate your being here.
Without objection, all Members will have 5 legislative days
to submit to the Chair additional written questions for the
witnesses, which we will forward and ask the witnesses to
respond to as promptly as they can so that their answers may be
made part of the record.
Without objection, all Members will have 5 legislative days
to submit any additional materials for inclusion in the record.
We stand adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 6:04 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
