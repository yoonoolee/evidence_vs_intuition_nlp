CLASS ACTIONS SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE CLASS ACTION FAIRNESS ACT

----------

FRIDAY, JUNE 1, 2012

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on the Constitution,
Committee on the Judiciary,
Washington, DC.

The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 9:30 a.m., in
room 2141, Rayburn House Office Building, the Honorable Trent
Franks (Chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding.
Present: Representatives Franks, Chabot, King, Nadler,
Conyers, and Scott.
Staff Present: (Majority) Zachary Somers, Counsel; Sarah
Vance, Clerk; (Minority) Heather Sawyer, Counsel; and Veronica
Eligan, Professional Staff Member.
Mr. Franks. Good morning to everyone. I appreciate the
witnesses being here, those in the audience, and the Members.
Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare the
recess of this Committee at any time.
In 2005, Congress passed the Class Action Fairness Act, or
CAFA as it is commonly known, and President Bush signed it into
law. The bill was introduced by Mr. Goodlatte in the House and
Mr. Grassley and Mr. Kohl in the Senate and received strong
bipartisan support in both chambers. Seven years have passed
since then and, as the primary Subcommittee with jurisdiction
over civil justice reform, I think it is time to take a look at
how CAFA is working. So I have called today's hearing to
examine what has worked, what hasn't, and to see what Congress
may have missed when it wrote CAFA.
The class action is a mechanism designed to allow injured
parties to join together with others who have suffered the same
harm when their claims are not large enough to make pursuing
them individually cost-efficient. If used properly, class
actions are a valuable tool in our system of justice, but they
are only beneficial when redress of actual injury suffered by
class members is the priority of the litigation. However, in
recent years, class actions have been used with increased
frequency and in ways that do not promote the interests they
were intended to serve.
CAFA was designed as a balanced approach to address some of
the most egregious problems in class action litigation. The act
was not intended to be a panacea that would correct all issues
with class action litigation. Rather, its goals were to promote
fairness, ensure that interstate class actions are tried in
Federal court, and establish new protections for consumers
against abusive class action settlements.
In many ways, the act has been highly successful at
achieving its goals. Nationwide class actions are now more
regularly filed in Federal court and defendants can now more
easily remove these class actions from State to Federal court.
CAFA has also been successful at placing coupon settlements, in
which the class members are compensated in near-worthless
coupons, under increased scrutiny.
However, despite CAFA's successes, many observers have
concluded that some Federal courts have failed to follow
congressional intent in applying the statute. This has allowed
plaintiffs' attorneys to develop new tactics to get around some
of CAFA's provisions in ways that have undermined the goals of
Congress.
Additionally, other legal commentators have raised concerns
about abuses that CAFA did not address. One of the problems
that has emerged since CAFA's enactment is a new form of forum
shopping. Whereas prior to CAFA plaintiffs' attorneys filed
suit in what were perceived to be the most favorable State
courts, after CAFA it appears that attorneys are choosing to
file class actions in certain Federal appeals circuits due to a
favorable circuit precedent. This is a troubling trend
considering that Federal law is supposed to be applied
uniformly throughout the country.
This nonuniform application of the law has cut against
congressional intent that interstate class actions be tried in
Federal court and has led to attempts to game the system. For
instance, certain Federal appeals circuits have allowed
plaintiffs' attorneys to avoid Federal jurisdiction by putting
the burden on the defendant to prove to a, ``legal certainty''
that the damages at issue exceed the $5 million jurisdictional
minimum. Defendants are obviously reticent to prove the
plaintiff's case on damages to a legal certainty.
In other cases, plaintiffs' attorneys have been permitted
to avoid CAFA's requirements by splitting mass actions into
groups of 99 or fewer plaintiffs to avoid CAFA's requirement
that mass actions with 100 or more plaintiffs be tried in
Federal court.
Additionally, although CAFA did restrict coupon settlements
in many class actions, an equally egregious replacement has
emerged: cy-pres settlements. In these cases, an uninjured
third-party with no connection to the litigation, usually a
nonprofit organization, is awarded money as part of a
settlement because it would be too difficult or costly to
identify alleged victims. These settlements present a whole
host of problems, not the least of which is that they almost
certainly violate the Constitution's Article III ``case or
controversy'' requirement.
Now, these, I am sure, are just a few of the problems that
have emerged since CAFA was enacted 7 years ago. Although I
believe that CAFA has been a success overall, I hope that
through this hearing we can examine what improvements may be
needed to ensure that this system is functioning as it should.
We must make sure that the rules governing class actions are
fair to both plaintiffs and defendants and that they comply
with the dictates of Article III of the Constitution.
And, with that, I would now yield to the Ranking Member of
the Subcommittee, Mr. Nadler, for his opening statement.
Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
At the start of the 109th Congress 7 years ago, Republican
leadership made the Class Action Fairness Act one of their top
legislative priorities. Having failed to pass similar
legislation in prior Congresses, they wasted no time after
taking control of both houses in the November 2004 elections.
Republicans introduced a bill on January 25, 2005, rushed it
through both chambers, and got it on the President's desk for
signature 24 days later. They moved so fast that the Committee
report, upon which many defendants rely in making removal
arguments to the courts, was not even filed until 10 days after
the bill had been signed into law.
CAFA's proponents claimed that the law was needed to stop
plaintiffs' lawyers from bringing class actions to State courts
known to be hostile to defendants, particularly out-of-State
defendants, and then leveraging those cases to force large
settlements. Never mind the many State class actions have
uncovered significant corporate wrongdoing, vindicated
protections provided under State law, and compensated victims.
It was, after all, State class actions that finally uncovered
years of corrupt practices in the tobacco industry, including
its promotion of addiction through manipulation of nicotine
levels and efforts to recruit teenage smokers. These class
actions required the tobacco industry to pay $200 billion for
the public health disaster caused by smoking, dismantled
certain industry groups that had spearheaded the industry's
public disinformation campaigns, and banned certain forms of
advertising and marketing.
State class actions have similarly uncovered contamination
of groundwater that cause certain forms of cancer, fraudulent
pricing practices and misleading advertising by drug companies,
and predatory payday lending practices. Lawsuits asserting
State common law tort and fraud claims and seeking the
protection of State consumer and environmental laws have
resulted in much needed reform of corporate practices and have
compensated those harmed by corporate wrongdoing.
Despite these benefits, CAFA's proponents unquestionably
sought to discourage class actions altogether by funneling them
away from State courts into the Federal courts, where it was
believed that Federal judges would be reluctant to certify
classes and would prove more favorable to defendants. Seven
years later, CAFA certainly appears to have achieved its core
goal of removing class actions from State to Federal courts.
Studies undertaken on behalf of the Federal Judicial
Conference, for example, show that the number of class actions
either removed to or filed originally in Federal court have
greatly increased since CAFA's passage.
These empirical studies tell us nothing about whether CAFA
has had an overall positive or negative impact on the
enforcement of legal rights, access to the courts, or the just,
speedy, and inexpensive resolution of class actions.
Kevin Clermont and Theodore Eisenberg, professors of law at
Cornell University, studied Federal court decisions involving
CAFA and concluded that the law has ``produced a lot of
litigation in its short life,'' mostly over questions regarding
who bears the burden of proving removal or the law's effective
date, and that ``most of this litigation has been socially
wasteful.''
I would ask unanimous consent to submit their article,
``CAFA Judicata: A Tale of Waste and Politics,'' for the
record.
Mr. Franks. Without objection.
Mr. Nadler. Thank you.
[The information referred to follows:]

__________

Mr. Nadler. Their conclusion is quite a blow for a law
touted as a key part of the Republicans' tort reform agenda.
Far from reducing frivolous, time-consuming, and expensive
litigation, CAFA appears to have encouraged such litigation,
enmeshing the parties and the courts in lengthy battles over
threshold questions that threaten meaningful access to the
courts and delay resolution of claims on their merits. Of
course, that may be the real intent of the law.
I, along with several colleagues, expressed grave concerns
and voted against CAFA because of the threat it poses to
meaningful vindication of State-based rights. It is State, not
Federal, law that provides many core health, safety, and
consumer protections. It is, therefore, the State, and not
Federal courts, that have authority to interpret their State's
law and enforce their State's vision of justice. CAFA upends
this system, making it far more likely that Federal judges will
have the last word on the meaning of State law.
While Federal judges presiding over a case under CAFA must
apply State law under the principles of judicial federalism
announced long ago in Erie Railroad Company v. Tompkins that
this task will prove more difficult as more and more cases are
removed from the State court. Gaps in States' substantive law
will grow wider as State courts are deprived of the opportunity
to address certain areas of State law, weakening the ability of
States to regulate activity within their borders, and protect
their citizens.
It has also become fairly common for defendants to remove
cases to Federal court and then to argue that a removed case is
too complex and unmanageable, because of the variety of State
laws that must be considered in the cases; it is too complex
and unmanageable to be certified as a class action under the
Federal rules. So, first, get it into Federal court; and,
second, say that Federal courts are incapable of handling it,
case dismissed. This seems like a one-two sucker punch, and I
am curious to hear from our witnesses today on how this
practice falls within the rubric of fairness under the Class
Action Fairness Act.
I am most interested in hearing about whether the
additional burden that CAFA imposes on Federal courts is
harming the quality of justice, not just for CAFA cases, but
for all other cases on the Federal docket. We raised concerns
about the vacancies in the Federal bench before CAFA was
passed. The percentage of vacancies has since doubled, from 5
percent to 10 percent as of September 2011. Yet the Senate
refuses to confirm the President's nominees. Something must
give in this equation. Congress cannot and should not continue
to burden and hamstring the courts simultaneously, particularly
where there is no demonstrated need to do so and no
corresponding assurance that Federal judges are willing and
able to undertake the task that we have imposed.
With that, I look forward to hearing from our witnesses,
and I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. Franks. I thank the gentleman.
And I now yield to the Ranking Member of the full
Committee, Mr. Conyers, for his opening statement.
Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Anyone listening to our opening statements would think that
we are talking about two different things. The wide differences
of the view are astounding, but they happen regularly in the
Judiciary Committee. I tend to lean toward the Nadler
description of what it is we are doing here today and why we
are doing it, and I would like to add a few other additional
points to that viewpoint.
First of all, I think the Class Action Fairness Act was
seriously misnamed. It is anything but that. It was designed to
benefit the defendants and work to the detriment of the large
numbers of people who suffered harm. The fact is that the Class
Action Fairness Act has worked well in helping defendants
remove cases to the Federal court, where the proponents think
they will have a greater advantage. As much as this bill was
promoted as a necessary curb to forum shopping, it has proved
to be the ultimate form of forum shopping for the defendants.
I had three concerns in 2005. I still have them, and would
point out that, first, the Class Action Fairness Act undermines
State laws and State courts. State law provides the source of
many consumer and environmental protections through tort and
statutory law. Class actions are vital to enforcing these
rights, as they allow the aggregation of smaller claims that
otherwise might not warrant individual litigation. The Class
Action Fairness Act makes virtually every class action, by
allowing removal by the defendant so long as at least one
defendant and one class member are diverse, removable to the
Federal courts, divesting State courts, of course, of the
ability to interpret and develop State law.
Secondly, the Class Action Fairness Act makes class
certification more difficult and expensive. We warned that
Federal courts would be less likely to certify class actions,
especially given the requirements of the Federal rules of civil
procedure for predominant questions of law and fact. And then
especially in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in Wal-
Mart Stores v. Dukes, where a million and a half female workers
had their case thrown out as a result of a five-four
ideological division in the Court on whether the suit satisfied
the requirement, whether these were questions of law or fact
common to the class of female employees. The five conservative
justices said ``no,'' shutting down the suit and limiting the
ability of other plaintiffs to ban together. This rule makes
Federal courts an even more favorable forum for defendants in
both environmental/consumer and employment discrimination
cases.
Third, we expressed the concern that the bill would
increase the workload of our already overburdened courts. It
has been already observed that the number of vacancies has
doubled and there are far fewer Federal judges than State
judges. And growing caseloads leave Federal judges even less
time.
And so I look forward to the testimony, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
Mr. Franks. And I thank the gentleman.
And, again, I welcome the witnesses here this morning.
Our first witness is Martin Redish, the Ancel Professor of
Law and Public Policy at Northwestern University School of Law.
He has been described as ``without a doubt the foremost scholar
on issues of Federal court jurisdiction in this generation''
and has been recognized as the 16th most cited legal scholar of
all time. Professor Redish is the coauthor and the author of
more than 80 articles and 15 books, including the book
``Wholesale Justice: Constitutional Democracy and the Problem
of the Class Action Lawsuit.''
Our second witness is Thomas Sobol, a managing partner of
Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro's Cambridge office. In practice for
almost 30 years, he leads drug-pricing and healthcare class
actions against pharmaceutical and medical device
manufacturers, recovering more than $12 billion for his
clients. Mr. Sobol has served as a Special Assistant Attorney
General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the States of
New Hampshire and Rhode Island and as private counsel for
Massachusetts and New Hampshire in litigation against the
tobacco industry.
Our final witness is John Beisner, co-head of Skadden's
Mass Torts and Insurance Litigation group. Over the past 25
years, he has defended major U.S. and international
corporations in more than 600 purported class actions filed in
Federal courts and in 40 State courts at both the trial and
appellate levels, including matters before the U.S. Supreme
Court. Mr. Beisner a frequent writer and lecturer on class
action and complex litigation issues and has been an active
participant in litigation reform initiatives.
And, again, I want to thank you all for appearing before us
today.
And each of the witnesses' written statements will be
entered in the record in its entirety. I would ask that each
witness summarize his testimony in 5 minutes or less. To help
you stay within that time, there is a timing light on the
table. When the light switches from green to yellow, you will
have 1 minute to conclude your testimony. When the light turns
red, it signals that the witness' 5 minutes have expired.
And before I recognize the witnesses, it is the tradition
of the Subcommittee that they be sworn. So if you will please
stand.
[Witnesses sworn.]
Mr. Franks. Thank you. You may take a seat.
Also, to the witnesses, please turn on your microphone
before speaking.
I would now recognize our first witness, Professor Redish,
for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF MARTIN H. REDISH, ANCEL PROFESSOR OF LAW AND
PUBLIC POLICY, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW

Mr. Redish. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I would like to preface the substance of my comments by
emphasizing that it is now time for Congress to take control of
important procedural issues. Normally, Congress cedes to the
Rules Advisory Committee and ultimately to the Supreme Court
the control of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. But there
are certain procedural devices--class actions being perhaps the
most important, but others, including discovery abuse and
discovery cost allocation, which are deserving of significant
concern now--have enormous impact on the lives of our citizens,
have sociopolitical impacts on the Nation and on the economy
that go well beyond the four walls of the courthouse.
The Advisory Committee is not elected, is not accountable,
is not representative. The Supreme Court, for very important
reasons, is not elected or accountable. It is only this body,
the Congress of the United States, that is representative of
and accountable to the electorate. It is this body that should
be making the basic moral socioeconomic choices as to how
procedure operates when that procedure has significant impact
outside of the four walls of the courthouse.
Now, today our concern is the class action. The Class
Action Fairness Act was a major reform that I believe has done
a great deal of good, but it is time to move on to other areas
of reform. The modern class action has significant pathologies
that undermine basic due process rights of individual litigants
and, more importantly for present purposes, the separation of
powers and distribution of authority between the judicial and
legislative branches.
The class action, contrary to the views of many, is not a
roving instrument to do justice. The class action is a Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure appearing in Rule 23. It comes right
after Rule 22 dealing with interpleader and before Rule 24
dealing with intervention. A lawsuit does not arise under Rule
23. A lawsuit arises under the substantive law, be it
legislative, common law, or constitutional law, that is being
enforced in the particular proceeding.
What has happened in all too many situations is that,
through a process equivalent to a type of alchemy, the class
action procedure, in direct contravention to the directives of
the Rules Enabling Act pursuant to which the Federal rules were
enacted and in direct contravention to the separation of powers
between the branches, alters the underlying DNA of the
substantive law.
Substantive law contains two portions: a proscriptive
portion, what primary behavior is prohibited or restricted; and
a remedial portion, how are we to remedy violations of the
proscriptive portions of the law. In all the laws that are
being enforced in the modern class action, the remedial device
chosen by Congress or in diversity cases by the state,
legislatures is a compensatory device. The legislative body
simultaneously deters future harm and compensates individuals
who have been injured as a result of the violation of their
legal rights.
But in all too many situations, the class action is what I
call a ``faux class action.'' It is a cardboard cutout of a
class action. Many class members, because they become members
of the class through mere inertia rather than by any
affirmative choice on their part, are completely unaware that
they are involved in a lawsuit. Many are unfindable and
unreachable. Oftentimes the claims are so small that it
wouldn't make sense for them, as a matter of economic
efficiency, to file.
What happens in these cases is that the lawyers become the
real parties in interest. The lawyers, bringing these suits,
who are uninjured in any legally cognizable way, are the ones
pursuing the remedy. This is not necessarily illegal because we
have qui tam suits, but that is not what these underlying laws
have provided.
The cy-pres remedy that has been provided as a means of
covering these kinds of violations of substantive law has been
used all too often where the money that goes unclaimed is given
to a charity. The charity is not an injured party, the charity
has not suffered harm, and this is a symptom of the perversion
of the class action process. I believe significant legislative
reforms are called for.
Thank you.
Mr. Franks. Thank you, Professor.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Redish follows:]

__________
Mr. Franks. And I now recognize Mr. Sobol for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF THOMAS M. SOBOL, PARTNER,
HAGENS BERMAN SOBOL SHAPIRO, LLP

Mr. Sobol. Good morning, Mr. Franks. Good morning, Members
of the Subcommittee.
I bring to bear 30 years of the practice of law and some
real-world experience in dealing with class actions. And while
I do so, my views are my own, not those of my clients or my
firm.
Now, if the proponents of CAFA made one promise about the
new statute, it was, to use their own words, this: that CAFA
does not change substantive law--that is, in effect, it is a
procedural provision only.
Now, judged by those terms, CAFA is an abysmal failure. It
is true that over the past 7 years since its passage, CAFA has
changed where cases get filed, and it has stopped or prevented
the occasional reverse auction where the rights of consumers
are not sufficiently recognized. But CAFA's biggest impact has
been to deny consumers access to substantive State laws that
protect consumers.
CAFA usurped from State courts the ability to interpret
their own laws and protect their own citizens. It vested in the
Federal judiciary with virtually sole authority over nationwide
or multi-State class actions. But, at the same time, CAFA did
not provide any instruction as to how the Federal judiciary was
to handle these numerous large State-law-based consumer
protection cases. It did not explain how a single Federal judge
was to handle what previously had been the work of numerous
State court judges addressing many separate State class actions
involving State law.
By failing to do so, CAFA presents the Federal judiciary
with a problem for which there is no immediate solution. As a
result, Federal courts often deny certification of multi-State
class actions when multiple States' laws are at play. The
denial of access of justice is not based on the merits of the
case but on a technical procedural issue under the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure--manageability. And the result is that
consumers are denied access to justice.
Decades ago, every State passed consumer protection
statutes prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices. But
when all is said and done, State consumer protection laws are
based on a single simple proposition: Don't lie, don't steal,
don't cheat. Most big and small businesses have no problem
complying with this simple proposition. It is only the rare and
unethical of businesses or businesspersons who become
defendants in significant consumer protection matters. On this,
there can be no partisan view and no belief that businesses
need to be free to lie, steal, or cheat.
Now, contrary to most Federal statutes and regulations,
every State consumer protection statute provides both public
and private enforcement. And the predominance of State action
in this area is consistent with tradition. The Supreme Court
has long recognized the historic primacy of State regulation in
matters of health and safety. But then Congress enacted CAFA,
brandishing a machete where a scalpel would have sufficed to
address complaints about the class action vehicle. In wielding
this awkward instrument, Congress ignored its potential and
likely effects on consumers' ability to bring State consumer
protection and common law claims.
Since the passage of CAFA, Federal courts have denied
efforts to certify claims by consumers basically on the basis
that the cases are too complicated or too unmanageable. In
other words, as I think that Mr. Nadler indicated, there has
been a one-two punch. First, the cases must go to Federal
court, and they all get consolidated into one place. But now
that they are all consolidated in one place, they are too
complicated to proceed.
As the grounds of the denial of class certification,
Federal courts often cite the need to apply the law of the
State where each consumer resides because each respective
State's interest in enforcing its consumer laws trumps its
interest. But by refusing to certify any class in the face of
unmanageability or insurmountable obstacles posed by multiple
State laws, these certification refusals deny American citizens
their constitutional guarantee to a day in court.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Franks. Thank you, sir.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Sobol follows:]

Mr. Franks. And, Mr. Beisner, we recognize you for 5
minutes, sir. And don't forget your microphone.

TESTIMONY OF JOHN H. BEISNER, PARTNER, SKADDEN, ARPS

Mr. Beisner. Good morning, Chairman Franks, Ranking Member
Nadler, and Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting
me to testify here today about the Class Action Fairness Act
and paths forward for improving Federal class action practice.
CAFA's success in reforming Federal class action practice,
I believe, is undeniable. The law has accomplished each of its
stated primary goals: one, assuring fair and prompt recoveries
for class members with legitimate claims; two, restoring the
intent of the Framers of the Constitution by authorizing
Federal jurisdiction over interstate class actions of national
importance; and, three, encouraging innovation on the part of
American businesses.
Most importantly, CAFA has allowed a substantial number of
class actions to be heard by Federal courts that otherwise
would have proceeded in State courts. Many of those State
courts were previously regarded as magnet jurisdictions because
they allowed lax class certification standards and therefore
attracted huge numbers of class actions.
One such magnet jurisdiction was Madison County, Illinois.
Prior to CAFA, this small, otherwise quiet county was a hotbed
of class action activity, with 177 class actions, many of them
nationwide cases, filed in the 2 years before CAFA was enacted.
In the 2 years following CAFA's enactment, only 16 class
actions were filed in that county, representing an annualized
decline of over 90 percent.
CAFA has also accomplished its stated goal of assuring fair
and prompt recoveries for class members with legitimate claims.
This important success of CAFA is largely attributed to
increased scrutiny of coupon class actions that frequently
offered class members only illusory benefits.
CAFA has also encouraged innovation by sounding the death
knell for improper coercive nationwide class actions. Prior to
CAFA, magnet State courts frequently certified nationwide class
actions. And the way they did it--and I think this is
important, because there have been many references to this
point--the way they did it was by ignoring what the State laws
were. The State court in Madison County, Illinois, frequently
said, we don't care what the other States' laws are; we are
going to apply Illinois law to all claims nationwide. And that
was depriving consumers of access to justice under the laws of
their home State, what their home State legislators had decided
to do.
And the complaints about nationwide class actions not being
certified by Federal courts, it is in respect of those
principles that the applicable State laws should be applied.
And the simple solution is to bring single State class actions,
which is what most counsel are doing these days.
Now, like every piece of legislation, there have been a few
bumps along the road in implementing the statute. A few courts
have misconstrued the intent of the legislation. Most notably,
some courts have ignored CAFA's presumption of Federal
jurisdiction by imposing legal certainty-type obligations on
defendants seeking to remove claims to Federal court. Some
courts have also erred by applying CAFA's home State and local
controversy exceptions to Federal jurisdiction, I believe, more
broadly than Congress intended.
And some recent rulings by Federal courts and the Judicial
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation have suggested that single
State class actions may be remanded to State courts--I am
sorry--be remanded to the originating transferor courts before
class certification is decided, I think undermining Congress'
intent to have uniform decisions made in those cases, or at
least consistent decisions.
Now, because CAFA was primarily a jurisdictional statute,
there are a few troubling aspects of class action practice that
were not addressed by the legislation and remain. One is that
some Federal courts are not following the requirement that
courts conduct a rigorous analysis of Rule 23 prerequisites to
class certification. As Professor Redish has noted earlier,
there are concerns about cy-pres settlements. And a small
number of Federal courts, particularly in California, have
endorsed extremely overbroad class actions in which many of the
class members do not have Article III standing because they
were not injured. These include cases in which a case is
permitted to go forward even though the vast majority of class
members never had a problem with the product or service at
issue.
CAFA was a landmark piece of legislation, and I commend the
Subcommittee for holding today's hearing. And thank you again
for inviting me to speak.
Mr. Franks. Well, thank you, Mr. Beisner.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Beisner follows:]

__________

Mr. Franks. And I will now recognize myself for 5 minutes
for questions.
Professor Redish, I will begin with you, sir. You certainly
come to the Committee with unimpeachable credentials. And I
will therefore just ask an overarching question here at the
beginning, and that is, given all of the challenges and all of
the information that you have related to these types of court
and jurisdictional issues, what would you say to Congress
collectively would be the most important things we could do to
improve or fix the system as it is now? What changes would we
make, if you had the power to be Republicans and Democrats at
the same time--and I probably would warn you not to try. But,
please.
Mr. Redish. Mr. Chairman, I think there are two vitally
important reforms that could cure many of the significant
problems to which I pointed.
The first, and the simplest I think, would be to insert
into the certification process an additional requirement that
shockingly doesn't appear there, which is that before a court
certifies a class action, it must assure itself that a victory
would significantly benefit the members of the class. If the
court cannot be convinced by the parties seeking to bring the
class proceeding that a victory will be able to distribute
funds to injured individuals, then there is no business for
that case being certified as a class in the first place.
And the second major change, both to assure that due
process rights of litigants to be able to control their own
litigation when their claims are of significant value and to
prevent the class from turning into this cardboard-cutout, faux
class action, where their claims aren't of significant value,
would be to abandon the opt-out process, where--I call it
``Book of the Month Club service''--by inertia, by doing
nothing, you are a member of the class, but require somebody to
make the affirmative decision that he or she wants to
participate as a passive class member. In that sense, we will
be bringing the class action procedure back within the
framework of the Federal rules. It will then be a true
aggregation device and not a manipulator of the underlying
substantive law.
Mr. Franks. That sounds frighteningly logical to me. Yes,
sir.
Let me turn to you, Mr. Beisner. As I mentioned in my
opening statement, Federal law is supposed to be applied
uniformly, of course, in all Federal courts. In your written
testimony, however, you point out that certain Federal appeals
courts are applying CAFA's provisions in significantly
differing ways.
How big a problem is this? And should Congress get involved
to fix this issue, or do we just leave it to the Supreme Court
to sort it out?
Mr. Beisner. I think that it is a significant problem. And
I think, as you noted in your opening statement, it has
resulted, to some extent, in counsel favoring certain circuits
over others in bringing class actions to start with.
I do think that there are a number of circuit splits that
are out there on CAFA issues--that is, circumstances in which
the circuits are divided. Some of those have been presented to
the Supreme Court. So far, it has not concluded to hear those
cases, which is of course the Court's prerogative. But some of
them, I think, are causing significant issues and preventing
the full intent of the statute being fulfilled.
Mr. Franks. I might go ahead to ask you then generally the
same question I did Professor Redish, and that is, if you could
do any one or two things to improve the system as it is, what
would be your recipe?
Mr. Beisner. I think that two things would be important.
One is an effort to find ways for this system to be more
transparent. One of the things that greatly concerns me is a
reference to consumer class actions. Because if you peek behind
the curtain about what really happens in those cases, to the
extent that any money moves at the end of those cases it is
normally between the defendant and the attorneys, primarily, in
the lawsuit. And although I am not going to sit here and say
that there is no class action that benefits consumers--I
acknowledge that there are some instances where that occurs.
But in many, many cases, the benefit to consumers in these
class actions is very hard to find.
The second thing I would note is--and this is along the
lines of what Professor Redish noted earlier--I think that we
need to recognize that the class action is a very powerful
device. An attorney can walk into court and say, I am here to
represent millions of people in this lawsuit. Has he or she
asked any of them whether they want to be represented in this
particular lawsuit? No, you just go in and do it. And it seems
to me that some provisions that provide assurances up front
that there are actually people out there interested in this
lawsuit--not just the lawyer, who has, potentially, profit
motives for being there--would be interesting.
I know, for example, years ago, back in 1966, Congress
passed the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, a landmark piece of
legislation, and it authorized the bringing of consumer class
actions dealing with products and warranties in Federal court.
One of the requirements they put in there is, if you are going
to bring a class action, you have to have 100 named plaintiffs.
The lawyer has to go out there, and so there must be some
interest in consumers, because I have 100 people who are
willing to be part of this lawsuit. And it was a way of sort of
testing the waters to make sure that there was real class
interest in the lawsuit.
Mr. Franks. Again, the logic seems to be breaking out all
over the place here.
And I would now recognize Mr. Nadler for 5 minutes.
Mr. Nadler. Thank you.
Mr. Sobol, you testified that Federal courts, once cases
are removed from State courts, routinely deny certification of
multi-State cases when multiple State laws are at play because
of manageability concerns. Do you have recommendations for what
we could do help with this problem?
Mr. Sobol. I think it is important to draw a distinction--
--
Mr. Nadler. Before that, actually, let me--why is this a
terrible problem?
Mr. Sobol. The reason it is a terrible problem is that the
vast majority of consumer rights are based upon State laws, not
Federal laws. You cannot recover under most Federal laws any
type of consumer remedy. Instead, you must rely upon State law.
Now, if you bring a State law case, therefore, you either
bring a State law case--and this is important to draw a
distinction between what Mr. Beisner said. A case can either be
on behalf of all the States in the country for one class, or,
alternatively, you might have, as we used to have, State
actions, State by State by State, for the residents in that
State, on the basis of that State's law--50 State cases.
Now, if those 50 separate cases or 24 or whatever number of
cases get removed to Federal court, invariably they will be
sent a single judge, by reason of the operation of the Judicial
Panel on Multidistrict. And you then give one Federal judge the
task of performing what a couple of dozen State court judges--
--
Mr. Nadler. Let me just hurry this along. And they will
find that unmanageable and decertify.
Mr. Sobol. And then they say it is unmanageable----
Mr. Nadler. And decertify.
Mr. Sobol [continuing]. So they don't certify.
Mr. Nadler. And what is the result to the litigant? He has
no opportunity in State or Federal court, and there is no forum
for his rights at all?
Mr. Sobol. And is left high and dry.
Mr. Nadler. And there is no forum to vindicate his rights
under State law at all.
Mr. Sobol. No forum.
Mr. Nadler. Thank you.
Mr. Beisner, you just heard that exchange. Mr. Sobol
testified that Federal judges routinely deny class
certification and have removed cases that raise issues under
multiple State laws based on the arguments of the Federal rules
of commonality and that manageability requirements cannot be
met.
How often have you made that argument or something similar
on behalf of a client?
Mr. Beisner. Let me state that that is not the way it is
happening anymore. I think Mr. Sobol----
Mr. Nadler. Anymore? It happened but it is no longer
happening?
Mr. Beisner. Before CAFA was----
Mr. Nadler. No, under CAFA.
Mr. Beisner. Under CAFA? Under CAFA, what is happening is
that people, as Mr. Sobol is describing, are bringing class
actions on a single State basis. As he said, Indiana residents,
class action is brought on behalf of Indiana residents. It is
true, they are----
Mr. Nadler. It is then removed to Federal court.
Mr. Beisner. Removed to Federal court, they are brought
before an MDL judge. And the judge is looking at those cases
individually and deciding certification in those cases.
Mr. Nadler. But wait a minute, wait a minute. Isn't it true
that, in many cases, the Indiana case is brought and the
Illinois case is brought and the New York case is brought, they
are brought before the same judge combined, and then dismissed
on the grounds of unmanageability?
Mr. Beisner. No, that is not true.
Mr. Nadler. That is not true?
Mr. Beisner. There is no manageability issue in those
cases, because only one State law is applied to the law of the
single State.
Mr. Nadler. Would you comment on that, Mr. Sobol?
Mr. Sobol. I differ considerably with Mr. Beisner on that.
The practical reality, both in what happens in front of the
judges and what happens before you even file the pleadings, is
that the judges say, ``This is too much. I am not in a position
to sit on a multiple State court case. I don't have the time, I
don't have the attention, I don't have the law clerks to make
12 or 13 or 24 separate class certification decisions. Pick
your State, or let's find one State's law, let's try it that
way if we can, or find a Federal law''----
Mr. Nadler. Why can't that be done?
Mr. Sobol. Well, first, there are no Federal laws that you
can do it. And then when you try it under a single State law,
then you are butchering the fact that there are separate rights
for the----
Mr. Nadler. So that doesn't happen, and the case gets
dismissed on manageability.
Mr. Sobol. Right.
Mr. Nadler. Is that what happened in the Wal-Mart case?
Mr. Sobol. I didn't hear you?
Mr. Nadler. Oh, never mind. Never mind on that.
What should we do to solve that problem, Mr. Sobol, aside
from repealing CAFA entirely, but within CAFA?
Mr. Sobol. Right. The specific issue that we are talking
about is the ability of consumers to bring a single State class
action in that State's courts. If CAFA permitted those cases to
stay in State court, you would get rid of the significant
problem of denying consumers access to the protection of their
State laws.
Mr. Nadler. And what about--let me ask you a different
question on same thing. That would be logical, but let's assume
that for some reason Congress chose not to the do that. What
would you think of a provision that said that if a Federal
court denied certification on the grounds of unmanageability
because too many States were involved, that the State could be
unremoved back to State court?
Mr. Sobol. That would be another way to deal with it. Of
course, you are talking years down the road, rather than having
the ability to do it then, because you are not going to find
that ruling for, as a practical matter, 2, 3, 4 years down the
road.
Another solution would be to have an alteration to the
civil rules of procedure that say that you don't deny
manageability on the basis of the fact that you have multiple
State laws. You are still burdening the Federal judiciary with
a task that is----
Mr. Nadler. That amendment was rejected in this Committee
when Mr. Conyers and I offered it 7 years ago. On the floor,
not in the Committee--I am sorry.
Thank you very much. My time has expired.
Mr. Franks. Thank you, Mr. Nadler.
And I now recognize the distinguished gentleman from Iowa,
Mr. King.
Mr. King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate being
recognized and the testimony of the witnesses and the
professional opinion that you bring to the hearing here today.
I am listening to this testimony and this discussion, and I
am thinking about the class action lawsuits that stand out in
my mind. And some of them may or may not fit into the category
of this discussion here today. I am thinking of the Pigford
Farms issue as one--and I think you would all be familiar with
that case--on down through the Love case, the Keepseagle case,
the Garcia case.
And I am interested in an opinion of each of you gentlemen
as to whether the executive branch should be legally allowed to
enter into a de facto class action agreement without the
oversight of Congress.
And I turn first to the gentleman, Mr. Redish.
Mr. Redish. Congressman, that creates a very sensitive
question of separation of powers. I believe the executive
branch has the authority to enforce the law as it sees fit. And
if we are talking about the exercise of authority in an
individual case, to vest supervisory authority in Congress
could be seen as undermining the executive power.
So my tentative response would be, I think that is not only
appropriate, it may well be constitutionally required. But I
haven't studied the issue closely, so I wouldn't like to commit
myself irrevocably on that.
Mr. King. Okay. Mr. Sobol?
Mr. Sobol. I can make my remarks brief, for I have no
opinion on that subject. As far as I know, there are no
procedural safeguards that need to be added to that situation,
and I would leave it at that. Thank you.
Mr. King. Mr. Beisner?
Mr. Beisner. I am familiar with those cases, but I am much
in the boat of Professor Redish. I am not sure I am in a
position to offer an opinion on that, not having studied it all
that carefully.
Mr. King. I might take the opportunity to offer an opinion
myself, but I think I would like a follow-up question instead.
And that is, you are aware of the judgment fund that the
Department of Justice maintains, Mr. Beisner?
Mr. Beisner. Yes.
Mr. King. And do you have any idea what is in the judgment
fund?
Mr. Beisner. No, I don't.
Mr. King. Does the public have access to the amount of that
judgement fund, to your knowledge?
Mr. Beisner. I am not aware if they do.
Mr. King. Does anyone on the panel know if there is public
access to the amount in the judgment fund of the Department of
Justice?
Mr. Sobol. Don't know.
Mr. Redish. No.
Mr. King. Neither of the witnesses do.
And are each of you aware that the Department of Justice
occasionally reaches into the judgment fund and pays out in a
de facto class action suit? And I am speaking specifically of
the Garcia case.
And I would ask Mr. Beisner first. Are you aware of that?
Mr. Beisner. I am not aware of that.
Mr. King. Okay.
Are any of the witnesses familiar with the Pigford Farms
issue? I am putting you all on the spot here.
All right. I will make my brief statement on that, and then
I do have a follow-up question, and I will change the subject a
little bit. I can see what I have broached here this morning.
But my statement is this, that I have watched class action
lawsuits be blown out of proportion to the original claimants,
out of proportion to the original definition. I watched the
Pigford Farms issue come through this Judiciary Committee and
an attempt to pass a Pigford 2, which did finally pass this
House, but the same version did not pass the Senate. I saw
Barack Obama be elected as President, and then I saw the
Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, team up with Attorney
General Holder and go negotiate with the Black farmers and hand
them another $1.25 billion on top of the $100 million that was
authorized within the 2008 Farm Bill that was designated to be
the total sum to resolve any outstanding claims on Pigford.
So we have seen the executive branch go outside the
directive of the Congress and reach into a slush fund of the
Department of Agriculture for Pigford. We are watching them
reach into this judgment fund in the Justice Department for
Garcia and perhaps others. And I am very troubled by this lack
of formal oversight for de facto class action suits and actual
class action lawsuits.
But I would pose this question also, as I promised I would
change the subject, and pop this one up. And I would start
first with Mr. Redish. And that is, the term ``fairness'' was
something that--well, I should actually go to Mr. Beisner, I am
running out of time.
You use the term ``fairness.'' Can you define that for me?
It always confuses me when I hear that word. Marilyn and I have
raised more than one child. We know there is no such thing as
fair. How do you deal with that in the legal arena?
Mr. Beisner. I think the important thing to me in that
regard is that both sides get a fair hearing in court, that
both sides have the ability to present their viewpoints. And I
think that the law providing Federal court jurisdiction
certainly has achieved that.
Mr. King. But that is not really a definition, is it, Mr.
Beisner?
Mr. Beisner. I think----
Mr. King. How does the court define it? Is there a legal
definition that would help someone who has a blurry
understanding of this word ``fair''? It seems like it is a
utility word that can be used in any circumstance, and it is
always unfair to the other person.
Mr. Beisner. I think it is grounded in the due process
clause of the Constitution, which I think underlies Rule 23.
And I think the notion is that you have a procedural device
here, the class action, which puts enormous power in the hands
of those who are bringing the lawsuit and often invites a lot
of corner-cutting. And I think that, in this context, the
notion of fairness is to ensure that you don't get that sort of
corner-cutting in the lawsuit.
Mr. King. There is no word ``fair'' in the Constitution.
Mr. Beisner. There is what?
Mr. King. The word ``fair'' doesn't exist in the
Constitution or any of the amendments, correct?
Mr. Beisner. It doesn't exist in the Constitution, but I
think in the class action context the underpinnings of that
word lie in the due process----
Mr. King. It is a long definition, I grant you that.
And I thank you for your response, all the witnesses.
And I yield back.
Mr. Franks. Thank you, Mr. King.
And I now recognize Mr. Scott for 5 minutes.
Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First of all, the Pigford case, just to make a note about
it, that was a case of well-documented historic discrimination
against African American farmers that went on for years and
years. And, thankfully, with the Pigford decisions, some of
them have gotten compensation.
Mr. Sobol, can a lawyer walk into court without any
clients?
Mr. Sobol. No, sir.
Mr. Scott. Thank you.
And, as you are aware, justice delayed is justice denied.
If a State class action is filed and a removal action takes
place when the case should stay in State court, how much time
is wasted going to Federal court to try to get a removal that
is subsequently denied and the case remains in State court? How
much time is wasted in that process?
Mr. Sobol. Typically, a very considerable amount of time.
More often than not, it is going to take at least several
months to have a removal petition heard.
More commonly, though, for class actions, you will end up
having to be brought into the multidistrict panel process, wait
months for a hearing there, have the case go to the
multidistrict judge, and then have removal issues heard there.
Those issues are sometimes deferred for years while the court
sits on the remaining Federal court cases.
So a long, long time.
Mr. Scott. And if it ultimately goes back to the State
court, years could be wasted?
Mr. Sobol. Yes.
Mr. Scott. Now, if the desire is just to waste time, how
often do Rule 11 sanctions get applied to that situation?
Mr. Sobol. Rarely.
Mr. Scott. Ever?
Mr. Sobol. I would say, in my experience, never.
Mr. Scott. How often do class actions get caught up in
multidistrict litigation where there may be commonality but
State laws differ, comparative versus contributory negligence,
for example, that would dictate different outcomes? How often
do cases that could be resolved expeditiously in State court
get caught up in that, where you have multiyear expensive
litigation that is often at a very inconvenient forum? I guess
if you are in the east coast, you may just have the unfortunate
situation that it is assigned to a judge on the west coast.
Mr. Sobol. Since CAFA, the vast majority of cases get
removed or filed in Federal Court, and they get delayed at a
very considerable period of time. And the State case--as
opposed to what a State case would do, which is, classically,
it would move along at a relatively swift pace, unencumbered by
these extra procedural issues.
Mr. Scott. Thank you.
Now, Professor Redish and Mr. Beisner, you have both talked
about these coupons. One has said it is not big enough to make
a difference, and the other said these things are illusory.
A lot of times, the only way you can bring a case for which
there are even nominal damages--for example, if a bank is
miscalculating interest for a few cents a month, nobody can
bring that case. Nobody can bring a case if a grocery store
scanner is miscalculating the amount owed. The only way you can
bring the case and stop it is to bring a class action and get
an injunction.
Now, if you do not have coupons, is your suggestion that
you not be able to bring the case at all? Or that if you have a
class action, people would be entitled to reasonable
compensation; say, you have a couple of million people
involved, everybody gets a couple hundred dollars? I mean, when
is your suggestion alternative to the coupons?
Mr. Redish. Well, Congressman, my understanding is that
CAFA pretty much did away, at least in the Federal system, with
the use of coupons in any event. And what has developed as an
alternative to that is the use of this cy-pres doctrine whereby
the bulk of the funds awarded will never, as a practical
matter, be distributed to the actual victims, those whose legal
rights have been violated, and instead----
Mr. Scott. But their legal rights are vindicated with an
injunction. You get the people to stop doing it.
Mr. Redish. Well, if we are talking about an injunction
class action under the (b)(2) category, that might well be
sufficient, real relief.
My concern is that we have a bilateral process with those
whose rights have been violated, those who have allegedly
violated them, and some kind of meaningful relief, whether it
is compensatory or, if appropriate, injunctive, being awarded.
But if that is not feasible, the idea of just bringing the
proceeding as some sort of generic deterrent is a dramatic
change in the underlying substantive law.
Mr. Scott. Mr. Sobol, can you say a word about the workload
in the Federal Court and what this has done to it?
Mr. Sobol. I couldn't hear you.
Mr. Scott. The workload in the Federal Courts?
Mr. Sobol. The Federal judiciary is very much overworked.
Particularly those judges who get MDL cases tend to be the most
overworked and the most qualified judges. It is very difficult
for them to sit on an MDL case and be expected to handle a
dozen or two dozen or three dozen separate State court cases.
Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Franks. Well, this has been enlightening to me, if no
one else.
I appreciate all of you for coming. I appreciate the
witnesses for your very insightful testimony, and appreciate
the Members for being here.
And, without objection, all Members will have 5 legislative
days to submit to the Chair additional written questions for
the witnesses, which we will forward on and ask the witnesses
to respond as promptly as they can so that their answers may be
made part of the record.
Without objection, all Members will have 5 legislative days
within which to submit any additional materials for inclusion
in the record.
And, with that, again, I sincerely thank the witnesses, and
I thank the Members and observers. And this hearing is now
adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 10:35 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
