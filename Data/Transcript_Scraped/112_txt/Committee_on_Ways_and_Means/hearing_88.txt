HEARING ADVISORY

Chairman Camp Announces Hearing on the Tax

Ramifications of the Supreme Court's Ruling

on the Democrats' Health Care Law

Tuesday, July 10, 2012

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-MI) today
announced that the Committee on Ways and Means will hold a hearing to
explore the implications of the Supreme Court's ruling that the
individual mandate is constitutional, particularly as it relates to
Congress's authority to lay and collect new taxes. The hearing will
take place on Tuesday, July 10, 2012, in 1100 Longworth House Office
Building, beginning at 10:30 A.M.

In view of the limited time available to hear from witnesses, oral
testimony at this hearing will be from invited witnesses only. However,
any individual or organization not scheduled for an oral appearance may
submit a written statement for consideration by the Committee and for
inclusion in the printed record of the hearing. A list of witnesses
will follow.

BACKGROUND:

President Obama and Congressional Democrats have long argued that
the cornerstone of the ``Affordable Care Act'' (ACA) (P.L. 111-148 and
111-152) is the requirement that Americans purchase government-approved
health insurance or pay a new tax (the ``individual mandate''), and
that the new law would not work without such a mandate. Many raised
concerns that such a requirement was unconstitutional because it
violated the Commerce Clause.

On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled (5-4) that the individual
mandate was constitutional. The Court rejected the Obama
Administration's argument that such power is granted under the Commerce
Clause. But the Court accepted a tertiary argument put forth by the
Obama Administration that the individual mandate was a tax increase
authorized under the Congress's taxing power (U.S. Const. art. I,
Sec. 8, cl. 1). Under the Constitution's Origination Clause (art. I,
Sec. 7, cl. 1), all revenue measures must originate in the U.S. House
of Representatives, and the rules of the House grant jurisdiction over
``[r]evenue measures generally'' to the Committee on Ways and Means
(Rule X, cl. 1(t)(3)).

In announcing the hearing, Chairman Camp stated, ``I strongly
disagree with the Court's decision and its holding that Congress can
tax Americans who choose not to purchase government-approved health
insurance. This ruling sets a dangerous precedent with potentially
enormous consequences. As the taxwriting Committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives--where, under the Constitution, all revenue measures
must originate--we have a responsibility to fully understand the
Court's interpretation of Congress's taxing authority and what that
means for potential actions taken by future Congresses, the future of
our country and the relationship that the government has with the
American people.''

FOCUS OF THE HEARING:

The hearing will focus on the implications of the Supreme Court's
ruling that the individual mandate is constitutional on the grounds
that it is a tax and that Congress has the broad power to levy taxes
far beyond the historic scope of raising revenue.

Chairman CAMP. Good morning.
Writing for the majority in the Supreme Court decision
handed down last month, Chief Justice John Roberts quoted the
Lopez decision, writing, and I quote, ``At the very least we
should pause to consider the implications of the government's
arguments when confronted with such new conceptions of Federal
power.''
Whether or not one agrees or disagrees with the ruling of
the Supreme Court or with the underlying law itself, the words
of the Chief Justice have great meaning, particularly for the
Congress and specifically for the House Committee on Ways and
Means.
On June 28th, 2012, the Supreme Court narrowly ruled that
the Democrat health care law's individual mandate was
constitutional. The Court rejected the Obama Administration's
argument that such power is granted under the Commerce Clause
or the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution. But the
Court accepted another argument put forth by the Obama
Administration that the individual mandate is a tax increase
authorized under the Congress' taxing power.
This holding is especially important for this committee.
Under the Constitution's origination clause, all revenue
measures must originate in the U.S. House of Representatives,
and the rules of the House grant jurisdiction over revenue
measures generally to the Committee on Ways and Means.
That is why we are here today, to focus on the implications
of the Supreme Court's ruling that the individual mandate is
constitutional on the grounds that it is a tax; and in light of
the Court's ruling Congress now has the broad power to levy
taxes far beyond the historic understanding of raising revenue.
By all accounts, the discussion surrounding the individual
mandate tax received only scant attention from the government's
lawyers. They devoted just a mere 21 lines of the government's
reply brief to the issue, and it was the subject of just 50
lines in the oral arguments held in March.
Yet in the majority opinion Justices Breyer, Ginsburg,
Kagan, Sotomayor, and Chief Justice Roberts upheld the
individual mandate as a tax. In doing so, they confirmed that
the individual mandate which President Obama, Senate Majority
Leader Reid, House Minority leader Pelosi, and the Obama
Administration's lawyers called essential to its health care
law more than 100 times in their legal briefs is a tax and must
now be pursued solely under the Congress' taxing power.
So as Chief Justice Roberts suggested, today we pause to
consider the implications. As a result of the Court's opinion,
the limits on the Congress' taxing power are now anything but
clear.
Some may argue that this ruling simply reaffirms a power
that Congress has always had. However, until the Democrats
enacted their health care law and until the individual mandate
tax was determined to be an acceptable use of Congress' taxing
power, the power to tax had never been used to coerce people
who do not purchase a specific product or service. This is the
first indirect tax on inactivity in American history. In the
case of the Court's ruling that the individual mandate is a
tax, both of those notions are reinforced: that absence of
action is taxable and that the government can compel
individuals to act.
The purpose of the individual mandate tax is to force
people to do what they otherwise may not freely choose to do.
In this case, beginning in 2014, the Federal Government will
force individuals to purchase government-approved health
insurance. And how is this different than the government
requiring Americans to purchase broccoli or pay a tax for not
doing so? How is this different than the government requiring
Americans to purchase low fat or low salt foods or pay a tax as
a means to fight the obesity epidemic?
After all, the case put forth by the Democrats and the
President was that the individual mandate was necessary to
improve the Nation's health. Under that premise, what is there
to stop future Congresses from using this taxing authority to
compel a similar ``it's good for the country'' outcome? If one
refuses to purchase the goods and services the government
thinks are best for the country, the act of not purchasing can
now trigger a tax.
Without a doubt the Supreme Court's ruling that the
individual mandate is a tax reveals it can only be
characterized as a brave new world. And, as such, its
implications might be imagined but can not be entirely known.
Chief Justice John Marshall said in the early days of the
Republic, the power to tax is the power to destroy. As Congress
examines this new taxing power, we must consider whether a
future Congress will restrain itself from using the power to
control individual lives and decisions or whether this is just
a first step into that brave new world. Those are the issues we
will explore today.
I welcome our panel of witness and look forward to their
testimony.
I will now recognize Ranking Member Levin for the purpose
of an opening statement.
Mr. LEVIN. Thank you.
Welcome to all of you coming--all of you on the panel.
As everyone knows by now, the individual responsibility
requirement, the so-called mandate or the free rider provision
in the Affordable Care Act, was modeled after a similar
provision in Governor Romney's health care law in
Massachusetts. Obamacare is Romneycare.
The Supreme Court found the individual mandate in Federal
law to be constitutional. We are here today because Republicans
want to discuss what it is called. So perhaps we should take
linguistic lessons from Governor Mitt Romney.
The Washington Post reported over the weekend, and I quote,
``As the Massachusetts Governor and then as a Presidential
candidate, Mr. Romney spent the next 6 years describing in a
variety of different ways the possible punishments for ignoring
the Massachusetts mandate as free rider surcharges, tax
penalties, tax incentives, and sometimes just as penalties.''
The bottom line is, whatever you call this, almost no one
will have to pay. That is right. Almost no one will have to pay
it.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that only 1.4
percent of Americans will pay anything for refusing to purchase
insurance. And that is just about identical to the percent of
people in Massachusetts who have paid the penalty under
Governor Romney's health care law, what Republicans like to
call, I think very inappropriately, a brave new world.
For most people, the penalty will be about the cost of a
health insurance plan, and most people would rather have
insurance. That is what Mitt Romney thought. Here is how he
described the mandate in 2005. I quote:
``No more free riding, if you will, where an individual
says, I'm not going to pay even though I can afford it. I'm not
going to get insurance even though I can afford it. I'm instead
going to just show up and make the taxpayers pay for me.
``It's the ultimate conservative idea''--Mr. Romney
continued--``which is that people have responsibility for their
own care and they don't look to government to take care of them
if they can afford to take care of themselves.''
That was in '05.
In April, 2010, I quote: ``Right now, in lots of parts of
the country, if individuals do not have insurance they can
arrive at the hospital and be given free care paid for by
government. Our current system is a big government system. A
conservative approach is one that relies on individual
responsibility. But in my view, and others are free to
disagree, expecting people who can afford to buy insurance to
do so is consistent with personal responsibility and that is a
cornerstone of conservatism.''
And it did not just start with Governor Romney. I would
like to enter into the record the original Heritage Foundation
report that introduced the concept of a mandate. I ask for----
Chairman CAMP. Without objection.

Mr. LEVIN. Bills with an individual responsibility
provision have been cosponsored by Republicans for decades. You
all can run, but you can't hide. You are essentially trying to
bloody the nose of something you were for before you were
against it. And so you think you have found the right cudgel,
the word ``tax,'' but it is a cudgel that is only going to
impact 1.4 of Americans who are free riding off of our health
care system and in order to stop that will pay a penalty.
Republicans are also making another false claim that health
care reform is a massive tax on the middle class. That is
false. Seventy percent of the revenues come from three sources:
industries who agree to the fees because they are benefiting
from millions of new customers, free riders, and the top 3
percent of taxpayers.
What this week is all about is not taxes. It is about
taking away extra protections against insurance company abuses.
That is the Republican agenda this week: Repeal the preexisting
conditions protection, repeal the removal of annual and
lifetime limits on benefits for the very sick, repeal closing
the prescription drug donut hole, repeal young adults staying
on their parents' insurance, repeal the cap on premium
increases.
Middle-class families have enough to worry about these days
as they struggle to recover from the worse recession in
decades. Instead of making it harder for them by putting the
insurance companies back in the driver's seat of our health
care system, this committee should be focused, as a number of
us have said so many times, on moving forward, on passing jobs
legislation that we can all agree on, instead of blocking its
arrival on the floor of the House of Representatives.
Chairman CAMP. Today we are joined by a distinguished panel
of constitutional scholars:
Mr. Steven Bradbury is a partner with Dechert LLP, and he
has served as the head of the Office of Legal Counsel in the
Department of Justice.
Ms. Carrie Severino is the Chief Counsel and Policy
Director to the Judicial Crisis Network and has served as a law
clerk for the U.S. Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for
the DC Circuit.
Mr. Lee Casey is a partner with Baker Hostetler and has
served in the Office of Legal Counsel and the Office of Legal
Policy in the Department of Justice.
And Mr. Walter Dellinger is a partner with O'Melveny &
Myers. Mr. Dellinger has served as the Solicitor General of the
United States.
You will each have 5 minutes to present your oral
testimony. We do have your written statements in advance. Thank
you for those. Your entire written testimony will be made a
part of the record.
And, Mr. Bradbury, we will begin with you. You are now
recognized for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF STEVEN G. BRADBURY, PARTNER, DECHERT LLP
(WASHINGTON, DC)

Mr. BRADBURY. Thank you Chairman Camp, Ranking Member
Levin, and distinguished Members of the Committee. It is an
honor to appear before you today to share some observations
about the Supreme Court's rulings on the Affordable Care Act.
First, while I believe the Court's reasoning on the
Commerce Clause is quite positive and historic, I am concerned
the decision to uphold the minimum coverage provision as a tax
has the potential to unleash the coercive power of the Federal
Government in a different guise. When Congress enacted the
Affordable Care Act, it plainly thought the individual mandate
was necessary to make the law work. The mandate was intended to
compel younger, healthier Americans to subsidize the insurance
costs of others; and it was designed to counteract the moral
hazard caused by the guaranteed issue and community rating
regulations which Congress recognized create a strong incentive
for people to forego buying insurance until they actually need
it.
Congress thought it could use its Commerce Clause power to
command people to buy insurance, and that is how the individual
mandate was primarily defended at the Court. But a majority of
the Court rejected this argument and concluded that the mandate
exceeded Congress' powers under the Commerce and Necessary and
Proper Clauses of the Constitution. I believe that conclusion
is a holding of the Court and will prove to be enormously
consequential for generations to come.
At the same time, though, the Court upheld the so-called
shared responsibility payment as a tax. This ruling means the
minimum coverage provision is no longer a direct legal mandate.
As the Chief Justice explained, to uphold the provision under
the taxing power, the Court had to read the mandate out of the
statute. Instead of saying that all Americans shall maintain
health insurance coverage, the law is now interpreted to say
only that certain individuals must pay a tax increase if they
don't have insurance. It is fair to ask how this ruling changes
the law Congress thought it was enacting and how Congress might
try to toughen the tax provision in the future to preserve the
original purposes of the mandate.
Back when the law was understood by everyone to include a
legal mandate, the Congressional Budget Office projected that
approximately 3.9 million Americans would opt to pay the
penalty rather than comply with the mandate. It is logical to
understand that this earlier CBO projection was based in part
on the assumption that most Americans would naturally feel a
strong moral imperative to comply with the law, even if it
wasn't enforced with criminal sanctions.
Now that the Supreme Court has announced to the whole world
that the minimum coverage provision is not a legal mandate but
only a tax assessment, it is equally logical to assume that the
actual number of individuals who will choose to pay the tax
rather than purchase insurance will be greater than originally
projected. That result is likely because, for most people, the
amount of the tax payment is currently going to be much less
than the actual cost of an insurance policy.
If the number of individuals who choose to forego insurance
coverage turns out to be larger than Congress thought necessary
to preserve the effectiveness of the insurance reforms, we can
expect Congress would try to ratchet up the tax in a renewed
effort to compel more Americans into the insurance market.
Although the Court has said that a tax can't be punitive,
the Constitution grants Congress wide latitude in setting the
amount of the tax, even if the tax is so high that it coerces
desired behavior or squelches undesired conduct. So, for
example, Congress in the past has enacted prohibitively high
tax assessments on certain things it wished to eradicate, such
as marijuana sales or sawed-off shotguns. A future Congress
might decide to do the same with the shared responsibility tax,
and the constitutional limits on how high Congress could raise
the tax are quite undefined.
Congress could also introduce the usual tax enforcement
measures such as criminal prosecution for failing to pay the
tax and invasive audits by the IRS, and these two would make it
more draconian for people to choose the tax option rather than
purchasing insurance. In other words, just when the Court has
reaffirmed so resoundingly the limited nature of the commerce
power, I fear we could still find ourselves in a world where
the government is effectively forcing people to buy something
against their will.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

STATEMENT OF CARRIE SEVERINO, CHIEF COUNSEL, POLICY DIRECTOR,
JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK (WASHINGTON, DC)

Ms. SEVERINO. Thank you, Chairman Camp, Ranking Member
Levin, and Members of the Committee. I am honored to testify
before you today about the issues raised by the new taxing
power recently described by the Supreme Court in NFIB v.
Sebelius.
The Supreme Court's decision upholding the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act was surprising to Court
watchers because it upheld the individual mandate based on a
theory that no other Court had accepted and that the parties
themselves gave short shrift in briefing and argument: that the
mandate operates as a tax that individuals may choose to pay in
lieu of purchasing health insurance.
When a case as major as this one is decided on a novel
theory that has been so minimally argued, there is a risk that
the majority had not fully considered the ramifications of
their decision. Unfortunately, the new tax authority described
by the Court has implications that are nearly as pernicious for
our constitutional structure as the Commerce Clause arguments
that got all the attention before the decision.
First, the majority's interpretation of the taxing power
creates a previously unheard of form of tax that is triggered
by mere inactivity.
Taxes are primarily designed to raise revenue and only
secondarily to influence behavior. With few exceptions, when
Congress has deployed the taxing power to incentivize behavior,
it has always been as a carrot and not as a stick. Thus, tax
credits and deductions are given for such favored activities as
raising children, purchasing a home, getting an education, or
driving a hybrid car. And even where the Federal Government has
used taxes as a stick to change behavior, such as taxing
alcohol to reduce consumption, people have had to do some act
in order for the tax to apply. But under the NFIB decision, for
the first time Americans will have to act in order for the tax
not to apply.
During the pendency of this case, many courts and
commentators noted the problems of extending a Commerce Clause
to allowing regulation of inactivity; and under the
Constitution's tax power the same distinction holds.
The Constitution allows taxes on activities, such as the
capital gains tax, which is triggered when you sell property as
a gain. It also taxes on inactivity through direct or head
taxes, but the Constitution itself strictly limits direct taxes
by requiring that they be apportioned among the States. Indeed,
the majority opinion clearly acknowledges that the mandate
affects the States unevenly and therefore could not pass
constitutional muster as a direct tax.
Caught in this bind, the Court simply declared that the
mandate operated as a never-before-seen tax, a tax on
inactivity that nonetheless doesn't need to be apportioned.
This move triggers the most damaging consequence of the NFIB
decision, a massive expansion of the Federal tax power. As a
result, we must again consider whether the Federal Government
can require people to purchase broccoli. This time by another
means.
Allowing unrestricted taxes on inactivity will open the
door to taxes the likes of which this country has never seen.
For example, rather than leaving it to municipalities to
incentivize recycling, the Federal Government could tax those
who fail to do so. Because preventative services are now
required to be covered by all health insurance plans without a
co-pay, Congress might tax people who failed to take advantage
of them.
Legislators could even tax anyone who does not own a gun,
citing studies that gun ownership reduces crime. And forget tax
incentives for installing solar panels. Congress can now just
impose a tax on Americans who refuse to buy them.
Whether any of these proposals are good or bad public
policy is beside the point. The point is that Congress can now
levy any or all of these taxes in the wake of the NFIB
decision.
Finally, the new tax regime could dramatically erode
democratic accountability.
The great Chief Justice Marshall recognized what the
Founders were keenly aware of, that an unlimited power to
attack involves, necessarily, the power to destroy. As such,
the Constitution's allocation of the taxing power to the House
of Representatives was specifically designed to maximize the
public accountability for this most dangerous power.
It is practically undisputed that the health care law would
have died in Congress if it were acknowledged by its backers to
be a tax that hit heavily on the middle class. But in the wake
of NFIB Congress now has the ability to pass massive tax
increases of virtually any sort without ever having to utter
the ``T word.'' If elected officials are allowed to represent
one thing to the people--it is a penalty--and another to the
courts--it is a tax--the democratic accountability envisioned
by our Founders will have been lost.
But even where Congress is acting with pure intentions,
those intentions may not be respected by the courts, who may
rewrite the statute in order to save it. That takes the tax
power out of the branch of government that is most
representative and puts it in the judicial branch, the one
purposely insulated from ever having to answer to the American
People.
As we approach the point where there are no judicially
enforceable limits on the enumerated powers of Congress, the
most important limits on future legislators will be those they
are willing to impose on themselves.
Thank you.

STATEMENT OF LEE A. CASEY, PARTNER, BAKER HOSTETLER
(WASHINGTON, DC)

Mr. CASEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Levin,
and Members of the Committee. It is an honor to be here to
discuss these very important issues this morning.
In assessing the Supreme Court's ruling in National
Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, it is important
to note that the decision has articulated clear limits on both
the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause,
holding that neither of these provisions can form the basis of
a general police power like that enjoyed by the States. In
addition, the Court also made clear that its decision in South
Dakota v. Dole does have teeth. Congress cannot use Federal
spending as a means to coerce the States into adopting or
implementing Federal programs. These aspects of the decision
are enormously significant and positive.
Nevertheless, in upholding the Affordable Care Act's
individual mandate as a tax, the Supreme Court has fashioned a
breathtaking new power for Congress. The Court held that
Congress can tax not only property or income or commercial
activity but also the mere failure to undertake some course of
action.
Congress' power to lay and collect taxes has, of course,
long been interpreted broadly. But as is the case with respect
to Congress' exercise of its commerce power, it is difficult to
identify any precedent where a tax has been imposed on the
simple failure to buy some good or service. Nor is it possible
to articulate a neutral judicially enforceable limiting
principle to keep this power from simply serving as the basis
for a general Federal police power.
Nevertheless, the decision having been made, the question
becomes what limits the Supreme Court is prepared to enforce on
Congress' power to lay and collect taxes. The Court continues
to acknowledge that there are such limits, at least in theory.
The Court restated its position that a tax which is a mere
penalty will not be sustained under the taxing power, although
it also declined to decide the precise point at which an
exaction becomes so punitive that the taxing power does not
authorize it.
As a practical matter, therefore, the real-world viability
of these limitations remains very much in doubt. This is
especially the case because the NFIB Court also severely
restricted application of another basic constitutional
limitation on the taxing power, the requirement that direct
taxes be apportioned among the States on the basis of
population. The Court avoided holding the individual mandate
unconstitutional as an unapportioned direct tax by narrowing
the meaning of direct taxes to capitation or head taxes and
taxes on real property.
Moreover, in upholding the mandate as a tax, the Court
suggested that the judiciary is not bound by Congress' own
clear reliance on the commerce power in enacting that
requirement. Here the Court relied on the long-standing rule
that, in determining whether or not a particular exaction is a
tax, it will disregard the label Congress may have used and
view its substance and application. This, of course, is based
on the obviously correct premise that Congress can neither
expand nor contract its enumerated powers by simple labeling.
Before this case was decided, however, that rule was never
applied in a manner suggesting that Congress could not choose
which of its enumerated powers to rely on in enacting
legislation or that the courts were not bound by that choice
once made and clearly expressed.
Arguably, this choice was not clearly expressed in the
Affordable Care Act. Although it identified the commerce power
as support for the mandate, the statute admittedly did not
specifically disclaim reliance on the taxing power.
In the future, therefore, Congress can put some limitation
on the taxing power, albeit a self-imposed one, by stating
plainly when it is and when it is not invoking its power to lay
and collect taxes. Such a truth-in-legislating requirement
would also permit the citizenry at large to accurately assess
responsibility for any particular exaction. This will help to
preserve the accountability the Constitution sought to
guarantee by granting Congress limited and enumerated, rather
than general, legislative powers.
Thank you.

Mr. Dellinger, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER, PARTNER, O'MELVENY & MYERS LLP
(WASHINGTON, DC)

Mr. DELLINGER. Thank you, Chairman Camp, Ranking Member
Levin, and Members of the Committee.
You have my written statement, so I would like to begin by
responding to the comments made by this very thoughtful group
of colleagues I have with me here today.
First of all, I want to respond to the notion that this
was--the provision in question, 5000A, was a heavy tax increase
on the middle class. I think that is clearly incorrect. As
Ranking Member Levin noted, this provision only applies to
somewhere between 1 and 2 percent of the public. It is a modest
financial incentive that is imposed--that is $95 first year and
never exceeds 2 and a half percent of income. It is imposed
only on that very small part of the population that chooses to
go without insurance and thereby to impose the risk of the cost
of illness or injury on fellow citizens.
Obviously, it does not apply to anyone who is on Medicare
or over 65, it doesn't apply to anyone who has insurance
through their employment, it doesn't apply to those who have
insurance through the Medicaid program, it doesn't apply to
those who have insurance through their college, it doesn't
apply to those who have individual policies, but only to those
who choose not to do so. That is a very small percent. And in
upholding it the Court said it leaves people with a real
choice.
There is no mandate here. You pay a modest financial
penalty, never to exceed the cost of insurance and never to
exceed 2 and a half percent if you choose not to have
insurance.
And what role does it play? Think how critical it is to
what this bill does accomplish. This is legislation which
guarantees to 100 million Americans that they will never have
to worry about lifetime caps on their insurance. That tells 5
million young people that they can stay on their parents'
insurance policy until they are 26. It tells more than 5
million senior citizens that they do not have to worry about
higher cost of prescription drugs in the donut hole and that
expands coverage to perhaps as many as 30 million people who
will be able to see a doctor when they are sick or can go to
see a doctor when they have a child who is ill.
Finally, and most critically, it says no one can be turned
down for health insurance because they have a preexisting
condition, which could have been asthma, it could have been
birth by cesarean. No one will have to face an extraordinary
jump in their premiums because they have a child born with a
birth defect.
But if you do that, if you guarantee people the right to
have insurance when they need it, you have to have an incentive
for those people to buy insurance before they need to. And that
is why the Massachusetts model was used here, to give a
financial incentive through a tax penalty on those who fail to
have insurance.
I think it is completely unremarkable--and I for one at
least expressed the thought that Chief Justice Roberts might
uphold this under the tax power--a completely unremarkable
application of settled precedent about the authority of
Congress to exercise its power under the clause, giving it the
right to raise revenues through taxes, excises imposed, and
through other revenue devices.
It was, to me, unremarkable that the Court upheld this. And
indeed any other decision, in my view, would have serious
implications for the self-government of the American People
through their elected representatives.
As the Chief Justice noted, the tax power is subject to all
the constraints of the Bill of Rights. You can't tax one party
or one religion more than another. And if you actually have
something which coerces people into activities that they would
choose not to, it is so punitive an amount the Court will
police the outer boundaries of that.
But to have the Court second-guess the Congress on whether
an incentive is too great an incentive I think substitutes the
judgment of five people who have never been elected for the
judgment of the elected representatives of the people.
And for the Court to say we are going to leave to the
Congress of the United States the determination within these
constitutional boundaries of how and whether to encourage
people or discourage people from engaging in activities through
the revenue raising powers, when they say we are going to defer
to the judgment of Congress, that means we are going have
government of the people, by the people, and for the people and
not government by judiciary.

Chairman CAMP. Well, thank you, Mr. Dellinger.
Thank you all for your testimony.
The Constitution requires that tax measures originate in
the House of Representatives, and this Committee is the only
House Committee authorized to consider such measures. At the
outset, I think it is critical for us to understand what kind
of tax is the individual mandate tax. And the Constitution
contemplates only two forms of taxation: direct taxes, such as
capitation and property taxes, which are subject to
apportionment requirements, as well as income taxes authorized
under the 16th amendment, and indirect taxes, such as duties
imposed and excises. And based on that power and the Court's
opinion I would like to ask each one of our panel of experts
just what kind of tax is this.
Mr. Bradbury, I will start with you.
Mr. BRADBURY. Well, before the Supreme Court's ruling, I
would have said it is a direct tax. It doesn't fall into any of
the other categories we are used to seeing. Even though it is
paid on an income tax return, it is not an income tax. It is a
specified surcharge. The Court said it is not a direct tax.
I would like to have seen a lot more briefing on that
question. I think that is a very hard question, at a minimum.
Chairman CAMP. All right. Ms. Severino.
Ms. SEVERINO. Yes, the dissent in this case points out that
this is a difficult constitutional question.
The first impression, this is a tax that doesn't look
exactly like the other direct taxes we have seen. The Chief
Justice is correct in that point. But it also looks nothing
like indirect taxes we have seen before. It is clearly not an
income tax. It is not an excise. It is not a duty. And the
question is, is it more is it like a direct tax or indirect
tax?
I think, given the fact that it is operating on inactivity,
it seems much more like a direct tax to me than it does an
indirect tax. Unfortunately, the Court I think went on with the
dissent called a lick and a promise and just said, close
enough, it doesn't look like the direct taxes we have seen
before; we'll call it indirect.
But I think the problem is it doesn't look like anything we
have seen before in terms of a tax. So we could use a lot more
discussion on that question.
Chairman CAMP. Mr. Casey.
Mr. CASEY. I agree with that.
To the extent that this provision ever looked like a tax
before the Court decided that that is what it was, it was a
direct tax that had not been apportioned, or at least that is
what it looked like. The Court has now said it is not a direct
tax. That was necessary to upholding it. Because, otherwise,
the tax would have been invalid as not being apportioned. So
the Court has told us that it is an indirect tax.
Chairman CAMP. Mr. Dellinger.
Mr. DELLINGER. Well, the face of the statute says it is a
penalty enforceable under the Tax Code. The taxing power
includes the authority to have penalties for failure to pay in
a timely fashion. There are a range of things that can be done
under the tax power. In this case, it is measured in part by
income. It is on the face of an amendment to the Internal
Revenue Code.
It provides that you pay an additional $95 that increases
to 2 and a half percent if you don't maintain adequate
insurance coverage. That to me seems no different than the fact
that your tax bill is higher if you engage in the
``inactivity'' of not putting aside funds for your children's
education.
It operates no differently than the tax incentives in the
law of which there are many and of this Committee is well
familiar. The amount you pay to the government goes up or down
depending upon a number of matters, like whether you can take
deductions for a home mortgage. If you simply do nothing, if
you don't get a home mortgage, your tax is higher. If you don't
put aside money for your children's education or for your own
professional development, you pay a higher amount to the
Federal Government. I think it is in fact no different from
that and unremarkable in that respect.
Chairman CAMP. So is it direct or indirect, in your
opinion?
Mr. DELLINGER. Well, it is not a direct tax because the
Court--the Court has never held anything to be a direct tax for
a very good reason. This was done to protect the slave States
by making sure that the property and slaves could not be taxed
in a way that was disproportionate. And what the Court has
held, that direct taxes consist of taxes on capitation, that is
on every single person like a poll tax or taxes on property or
the proceeds from property, this is none of those. So it does
not have to be apportioned.
Chairman CAMP. It is an indirect tax then, in your opinion?
Mr. DELLINGER. I am not--the nomenclature battle about
whether you call this a tax or a tax penalty or a penalty
strikes me as completely unfruitful. It is like asking whether
a Member who goes fishing is a Congressman or a fisherman. The
law says it is a penalty paid under the tax power as part of
your income tax. It says exactly what it is for on the face the
bill and exactly what the conditions are and exactly what the
amount is.
Chairman CAMP. Thank you.
Both the original House version as well as the original
Senate Finance Committee version of the Democrats' health care
law would have allowed the IRS to assess fines, file liens,
levies, pursue criminal prosecution, and even impose jail time
for failure to buy government-approved health insurance or pay
this new tax. These enforcement measures were eventually
limited in the Senate version of the legislation by the
addition of subsection G which prohibits the IRS from using
these specific tools to enforce the individual mandate tax.
Mr. Bradbury, could a future Congress strip subsection G of
the individual mandate just as easily as it was put in place?
If this were done, would the IRS then be empowered to fine
individuals who do not buy government-approved health
insurance, seize property, and even put them in jail if they
don't pay the new individual mandate tax?
Mr. BRADBURY. Yes. If it is a constitutional tax as the
Court has said, Congress can use all of its enforcement powers.
Chairman CAMP. And there would be nothing to bind a future
Congress from removing that subsection if they so chose?
Mr. BRADBURY. Absolutely not.
Chairman CAMP. Following the Supreme Court's ruling, the
Obama administration and congressional Democrats have argued
that only 4 million Americans will be forced to pay the
individual mandate, as if this were somehow a trivial number.
But it is actually a larger number than this. The Congressional
Budget Office has predicted that an additional 16 million
Americans who would not have otherwise purchased health
insurance would do so because they are forced to because of the
mandate in the law. And this figure is quite a bit higher than
we have seen from the administration.
This brings the total number of people who are directly
affected by the individual mandate to about 20 million
Americans, which is greater than the population of all but two
States, California and Texas, and I think hardly an
insignificant number.
There are also hundreds of millions of Americans who are
indirectly affected by the mandate. As I recall, there are only
a few people who are free of the new mandate tax, including
illegal aliens.
Mr. Bradbury, aren't the overwhelming majority of Americans
subject to the individual mandate one way or another?
Mr. BRADBURY. Yes, many of us, hundreds of millions, will
need to check a box on our tax returns certifying that we have
had the insurance required for each month of the tax year. And
that covers not just the tax filers but all their spouses and
dependents. So that affects our economic choices. If we choose
to drop the insurance we currently have, we will subject
ourselves to tax. So, potentially, hundreds of millions of
people are subject to the tax.
And the point I was trying to make is that I think the
CBO's $16 million figure suggests if there isn't a legal
requirement, a direct legal mandate, a lot more people will
choose to pay the tax than buy insurance, thereby undercutting
the purpose for the mandate that Congress had in mind and
leading I believe to a strong impulse in Congress to try to
raise the level of the tax and the penalties that apply to
enforce it.
Chairman CAMP. So, as I inquired, not only could the
imposition of penalties be changed by a future Congress but
certainly, since it is a tax now, the level of the tax could be
changed by a future Congress as well, as you point out.
Mr. BRADBURY. Yes. And the Constitution is very unclear as
to how high that can go.
Chairman CAMP. Even under the current law as written, the
IRS will have certain tools available to it to make sure that
there is compliance. What would some of those be, for example?
Mr. BRADBURY. Well, they are limited under the current
strategies--so they cannot use the full panoply of its criminal
enforcement and other powers, but others may know better than I
under the current law what specific tools IRS can use to
encourage payment of the tax.
Chairman CAMP. Is there anyone--Ms. Severino, do you know?
Mr. DELLINGER. I think, Mr. Chairman, that----
Chairman CAMP [continuing]. Could still audit, right?
Mr. DELLINGER [continuing). Under present law, I believe
the only tool that is available is to withhold parts of a
refund.
Chairman CAMP. And certainly auditing a return to make sure
that you have checked the correct box and that you actually
have, quote, unquote, government-approved insurance, wouldn't
that be a tool that still would be available to the IRS?
Mr. DELLINGER. Yes.
Chairman CAMP. Thank you.
Mr. Levin.
Mr. DELLINGER. Could I answer your--you asked two very good
questions: Aren't those directly affected considerably more
than the 4 million who will choose to pay the penalty? Isn't
the estimate that an additional 15 million people will purchase
insurance because of the incentive of this tax penalty and
doesn't that affect hundreds of millions?
I just want to briefly say, to me, I think the theory of
the law is and what Congress passed is it is a good thing that
15 million additional people will obtain health insurance, and
that does have a very significant effect on the rest of the
country because the rest of the country has been on the hook
for those people's medical bills. And we have a very
inefficient system for people who don't have health insurance.
They wind up in emergency rooms, and the costs get paid in
other people's premiums.
So it is estimated that other Americans' insurance premiums
will go down precisely because there will be 15 million more
Americans who have health insurance because of the incentives
created by this law. And the judgment of Congress would say
that is a good thing, not a bad thing.
Chairman CAMP. I think the issue there would be at what
cost, but we are not really getting into that now.
I yield to Mr. Levin at this point to inquire.
Mr. LEVIN. Well, thank you for coming. I think all of us
have a lot of respect for your talents, and I don't suggest
this is why you are here.
I think that it is important that no one be able to scare
the American people by suggesting the sky is falling or that
some wolf will be at their door. The law restricts what can be
done to implement it. There can't be jail and all of that. And
to suggest that Congress is going to use this authority to run
wild I think sells short the abilities and the talents and the
judgment of this institution.
We have been wrestling with the issue of health insurance
for over 70 years--for over 70 years, even longer--and this
Congress by a majority vote decided to chart a course where
more and more people would be covered, now 50 million who are
not. That was with a small D, a democratic decision. We did not
spend endless hours deciding whether it was the Commerce Clause
or the taxing authority. We thought we had the authority to
respond to the needs of the American people.
So I know you are not here to scare us or scare the
American people, and I hope you won't let anybody force you
into that position. It is possible, I suppose, to come up with
legal theories as to what might happen. You know, Social
Security, everybody has to pay taxes, everybody. There is a
small exception I think in terms of a religious view. So
anybody who works pays taxes.
And you can talk about this in terms of activity or
inactivity. Everybody wants to earn a living and wants to work;
and if they do, they pay FICA taxes.
And I haven't gone back and looked at Supreme Court
decisions--how many years ago now--70, 80 years ago. I am sure
there was an issue as to whether this institution had the power
to say to everybody, you work, you pay. And essentially what we
have said here was, you are all part of a health structure in
this country. And if you go--you are going to go at some point
in most every instance and receive health care. So you should
participate, and you should not be free riders.
That is what was said by Mitt Romney in Massachusetts. Mr.
Neal is shaking his head. He said, no free riders, and you pay
a penalty if you don't have insurance under the taxing
authority. That is what the Supreme Court said.
So I very much respect your talents, your integrity. I just
hope this hearing doesn't turn into essentially saying the sky
is falling when it isn't. Essentially what we decided to do is
to place some kind of a floor under health insurance so that
more and more people would receive it and that people would not
be penalized because of preexisting conditions or because there
were caps on how much they could receive, et cetera.
Thank you.
Chairman CAMP. Thank you.
Mr. Herger is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. HERGER. Ms. Severino, did President Obama's Solicitor
General Verrilli in his briefs and at oral arguments ask the
Supreme Court to consider the individual mandate as a tax?
Ms. SEVERINO. Yes, they have made that argument since the
district court level.
Mr. HERGER. So the Obama administration argued before the
Supreme Court that the individual mandate was a tax. This
highlights a concern I have. The President and congressional
Democrats clearly went out of their way during the legislative
debate to hide the fact that this is a tax. The President
himself said it was ``absolutely not a tax increase.'' Next,
they asked the Court to consider it a tax; and now they are
telling the American people it is not a tax. What does this do
to the system of checks and balances and, more broadly, what
does this do to government accountability by hiding the ball
from the American people?
Ms. SEVERINO. Yes, I agree, Representative Herger. This is
what I was trying to talk about when I was looking at the
accountability problem. We have a system where the tax power
has been interpreted very broadly by the Supreme Court in part
because there is a strong democratic check on the tax power.
Because no one likes to see their Representatives raising their
taxes, and so we assume the American people will be holding
Representatives accountable.
This is why the Founders purposely put the taxing power in
the House of Representatives where individuals represent the
people proportionately and where everyone is subject to more
frequent elections. So you have to answer at least every 2
years to the people if you raise taxes.
That system of accountability only works if we actually can
trust what our Members of Congress are telling us. If they tell
us, we are raising taxes, here is what we need to do it, you
have listed lots of good policy reasons you might want to
impose a tax to enforce this kind of health care law, that is
one thing. But it undermines the accountability of our system
to say it is not a tax and you are passing it and when the
American people are holding their people accountable to it and
then afterward to say, now it is a tax. Or, as the President is
doing, to say it is not stated in Court and to go back the next
day in the press and say it is not.
Mr. HERGER. Mr. Bradbury, the President has repeatedly
stated that he would not raise taxes for individuals earning
less than $200,000 and married couples earning less than
$250,000. However, there are more than a dozen tax increases
contained in Obamacare that would hit the same individuals that
the President claimed he would protect.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, roughly 75
percent of those expected to pay the individual mandate tax
would be individuals earning less than $59,000 per year or
families of four earning less than $120,000 per year. Doesn't
this break the President's pledge?
Mr. BRADBURY. Well, Congressman Herger, I think I will beg
off from commenting on the President's pledge directly. But I
will say that it is clear that, under the terms of the statute,
the shared responsibility tax has to be paid by any taxpayer
for whom the price of the average policy is less than 8 percent
of their income; and that is a lot of people below the levels
that you described. And as the CBO said, it is expected that
millions of people in those income categories for their own
independent economic decisions will choose to pay the tax
rather than purchase insurance. So it will apply to them.
And I will say that there are other provisions in the law--
taxes and other cost increases through the regulations--that
are likely to cause, as I understand it, employer-sponsored
health plans to get more expensive.
And now that there is no direct legal mandate that requires
everyone to have insurance, additional people may choose to
drop their employer-sponsored health policies because they are
getting too expensive and choose to pay this tax instead. So
the numbers could be greater. And I think that is reflected in
the 16 million additional people who can be expected, according
to CBO, to drop their insurance and pay the tax instead. I have
to think that that could even be greater.
Mr. HERGER. Thank you.
Chairman CAMP. Thank you.
Mr. Rangel is recognized.
Mr. RANGEL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I couldn't believe I was listening to Mr. Herger complain
about the President's or the administration's ambiguity about
the penalty tax or both. I have to tell you as one politician
to the other I find the position we find ourselves in as
Democrats a hell of a lot easier to deal with than the one Mr.
Romney is presenting. But after you conclude one way or another
whether the administration has made up its mind whether it is
penalty or tax, I hope you come with me and help me figure out
where Mr. Romney is on that very same question.
In any event, I think we did make a lot of mistakes as
Democrats in not really being able to sell the benefits of this
program.
I also believe that inherently people are not excited about
help that they don't really need. I think the fact that most
all Americans are fortunate enough to have health insurance is
a little difficult when you are talking about a tax or penalty
to get excited about someone who doesn't have it. But I think
the administration has not made the case that uninsured people
get health care.
Mr. Dellinger, I wish you could share the fact that,
notwithstanding the fact that we have 30, 40 million people
that don't have health insurance, that it doesn't mean they are
not getting health care and that this health care that they get
is not free. It has to be paid for. And that once we find some
way to take this burden off of the existing policyholders and
other people, it is actually a reduction in the cost for almost
all Americans.
Could you make that argument, that this is a reduction in
costs for the millions of Americans and 98 percent--that only
40 million people who are getting free health care will have to
pay for this? Could you share that view?
Mr. DELLINGER. Mr. Rangel, you are exactly right. Our
present health care system is quite dysfunctional, and there is
a strong conservative case to be made for supporting this kind
of health care reform.
Here is what happens with the 30, 40 million Americans or
more who are uninsured. First of all, they go without care and
treatment for themselves and their children in many instances.
In other instances, they show up in the emergency room, which
is a highly inefficient way to do it. Third, they get health
care far too late. It is much cheaper to pay for mammograms
than it is to deal with metastasized breast cancer. And fourth,
what happens is the cost is shifted to other people, and it is
reflected in other Americans' premium.
That is why if we do succeed in expanding coverage to tens
of millions of more Americans, then the average premium goes
down for Americans by a $1,000 or so. So there, it does have
that effect of making it a more effective system.
And unlike the single payer plan favored by many Democrats,
this is the option that gives people an incentive to have
private health insurance.
Mr. Levin was correct in reminding us that Social Security
was challenged very much in the same way in 1937. The
challenger said if you can set the retirement age at 65,
Congress can set it at 25. They set a minimum wage of $5 an
hour, it could be increased to a minimum wage of $5,000 an
hour, but the court rejected that kind of second guessing and
left those decisions to Congress, as I think it did at the end
of the day with this provision.
Also, Mr. Herger, if I can respond to your very good
question about whether this is--there is some bait and switch
going on. This tax or penalty or tax penalty or whatever you
want to call it, this provision was right on the face of the
statute. It says, on April 15, as an amendment to the Internal
Revenue Code, when you calculate your Federal income, if you
don't have insurance, you have to pay an additional $95. That
goes up. There was never any doubt about that. And the
Solicitor General made that argument clear.
But the reason that Governor Romney and President Reagan--I
am sorry--Governor Romney and President Obama, both were said
to have increased taxes. Both of them said we didn't increase
taxes, because not a single person in Massachusetts or America
has to pay 1 cent more in taxes if you will just have adequate
health insurance and not put that cost on others. In that
sense, it was not a tax increase in Massachusetts, and it is
not an increase in the United States.
Chairman CAMP. Thank you. Time has expired.
Mr. Johnson is recognized.
Mr. JOHNSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I would like to ask all of you really, have we ever in the
history of our country had a tax imposed on an individual for
failing to engage in an activity? A simple yes or no.
Mr. BRADBURY. Not that I know of, no.
Ms. SEVERINO. I am not aware of any.
Mr. CASEY. I don't believe so.
Mr. DELLINGER. I think the answer is yes, we have in the
form of higher tax bills, higher tax bills if you don't engage
in certain activity like putting money aside for retirement,
for college education, for home stuff. I don't know of any
instance where it is not done by a tax deduction or a tax
incentive, but I don't think it is----
Mr. JOHNSON. Okay. It is not a deduction. As Chief Justice
John Marshall once said, the power to tax involves the power to
destroy. Doesn't this ruling in effect destroy the individual
freedom to abstain from government-mandated activities, say to
buy an electric vehicle or install energy-efficient windows or
eat broccoli? Yes or no. Just the first three of you, please.
Yes or no, please.
Mr. CASEY. I think that is correct.
Ms. SEVERINO. I agree.
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. Bradbury, in your testimony, you say, in
addition to raising the amount of the tax itself, Congress has
a host of coercive tax enforcement mechanisms that it could
also introduce to ensure greater compliance with the tax
requirement. Would that include the IRS seizing American homes
and bank accounts?
Mr. BRADBURY. Yes.
Mr. JOHNSON. Thank you.
Mr. Bradbury, I am holding a copy of the handwritten note
from the chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, Mr.
Barthold, and I ask unanimous consent that it be entered into
the record.
Chairman CAMP. Without objection.
[The information follows: The Honorable Sam Johnson]
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 80439.171

Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. Barthold wrote in this note to then-
Senator John Ensign during the Senate Finance Committee markup
of the health care law in late September 2009--at the time, the
Senate bill included the enforcement mechanisms associated with
income tax. Senator Ensign and some others began asking if
Americans could be thrown in jail for refusing to purchase
health insurance.
Dear Senator Ensign, Section 7203 of the Code provides that
if there is a wilful failure to file, pay, maintain,
appropriate records and the like, that the taxpayer may be
charged with a misdemeanor with a penalty of up to $25,000 and
not more than 1 year in jail. Felony tax evasion provides for
restitution and a fine up to $100,000 for an individual and up
to 5 years in jail. Sincerely, Thomas Barthold.
The enforcement mechanisms mentioned by Mr. Barthold that
could be used against individuals who refuse to purchase health
insurance were later removed from the bill, but given that they
are in fact mechanisms to enforce a tax, not a penalty, the
ruling of the court allows these to be put back in if Congress
chooses to do so.
Mr. Bradbury, would you comment on that?
Mr. BRADBURY. As you indicate, Congressman, it would
require an amendment in the statute. But given Congress' broad
authority to enforce constitutional taxes, a future Congress
could amend the statute to include those kinds of enforcement
mechanisms.
Mr. JOHNSON. So the bottom line is that a future Congress
can change the law to send Americans who fail to buy insurance
to jail, true or false?
Mr. BRADBURY. Who fail to buy insurance and fail to pay the
tax. They can set the tax very high to try to force them to buy
the insurance, but if they choose not to buy the insurance and
fail to pay the tax, Congress could add criminal enforcement
mechanisms to the statute for those who attempt to avoid paying
the tax.
Mr. JOHNSON. Thank you, sir.
I yield back.
Chairman CAMP. Thank you.
Mr. Stark is recognized.
Mr. STARK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the
witnesses for their participation.
I just wanted to check with Ms. Severino, I think in the
past, once or twice you have indicated that the only recourse
that you would have here is, if you didn't like this program,
would be to move to another country, and I wonder if you know
of any other country that you could move to that did not have
universal health coverage paid by the taxpayers.
Ms. SEVERINO. I certainly don't think that the United
States is the only country in the world that does not have
that.
Mr. STARK. If you could find one, I would probably take up
a collection to get you a one-way ticket there. But I would be
interested in knowing where that might be.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield the balance of my time
to Mr. Doggett.
Mr. DOGGETT. Ms. Severino, do you have health insurance
yourself?
Ms. SEVERINO. Yes, I do.
Mr. DOGGETT. And Mr. Casey, are you covered by a group
health insurance policy.
Mr. CASEY. I am sorry by?
Mr. DOGGETT. By a group health insurance policy?
Mr. CASEY. Yes, I am.
Mr. DOGGETT. And Mr. Bradbury, are you also covered by
group health insurance?
Mr. BRADBURY. Yes, sir.
Mr. DOGGETT. I would like to put a chart up and ask Mr.
Dellinger, are you covered by health insurance, sir?
Mr. DELLINGER. Mr. Doggett, I am eligible for Medicare,
thank you. I think I was----
Mr. DOGGETT. I am impressed by that as I am by all of your
testimony, and you really made the point of this chart. But I
wanted to demonstrate it graphically because all three of the
experts who have offered insight this morning that were
summoned here at the request of our Republican colleagues are
in the same situation as 98.8 percent of the American people in
that they will not have to pay the tax of which they complain.
And you have just pointed out again a really big segment of
our population, Mr. Dellinger, who, like yourself, there is not
a single person who is on Medicare or about to come on Medicare
by the time that this act becomes fully effective who would be
subject to this tax, right.
Mr. DELLINGER. That is correct.
Mr. DOGGETT. And anyone who is covered by a group health
insurance policy, whether public or private employer, they
won't be affected by this tax.
Mr. DELLINGER. I have always been struck by the notion that
this relatively modest incentive to have insurance coverage was
seen as the sort of end of liberty as we know it. If you go to
work in the economy and you earn $18,000 a year and are subject
to Federal income taxes and FICA taxes, you are told you have
to pay 7.5 percent for Social Security for your old-age
sustenance. You are told you have another percentage to pay for
Medicare for your health care after age 65, and if you don't
have insurance coverage, you are going to have to pay up to 2.5
percent as an additional sum to be paid. Why would anybody look
at that and say, well, the 7.5 percent for Social Security is
fine, the percentage for Medicare is fine, but this last
percentage I would have to pay is the end of liberty as we know
it. And I would have to move to another country.
I welcome your presence, let me say for myself, in the
United States, and I hope that you remain engaged in these
debates.
Mr. DOGGETT. Well, Mr. Dellinger, your point is so
significant, and you have made it previously that while the
names may have changed on the groups, this same crowd, the same
thinking that opposed Social Security, that opposed Medicare,
is the same crowd that is out there opposing the Affordable
Health Care Act, even though less than 2 percent of the
American people would be directly affected by what Justice
Roberts, President Bush's appointee to the Supreme Court, said
was a tax rather than a penalty.
Now, with reference to that tax, I understand Mr.
Bradbury's testimony to be that even for the less than 2
percent of the people that are covered, the tax is so low, so
modest, that Congress may choose to raise it in the future. Is
it overall--it is I believe in the first year, your testimony,
$95 is the total amount of the tax if you are among the 2
percent who choose not to buy insurance, even though you have
the capacity to afford it and prefer to shift your health care
costs to somebody else?
Mr. DELLINGER. That is--that is correct.
Mr. DOGGETT. And with reference to the estimate, of course,
of 1.2 percent, that was done by the independent Congressional
Budget Office on the final bill as it became law after it
passed the Senate. So perhaps it goes up or goes down a little
bit. It is only an estimate, but is a very small number of
people that are affected.
And I yield back.
Chairman CAMP. Thank you.
Mr. Ryan is recognized.
All right.
Mr. Tiberi is recognized.
Mr. TIBERI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Let us follow up on Mr. Doggett's point about the 2
percent.
Ms. Severino, let's set the record straight. I wasn't going
to go there, but let's go there. Two percent, that is just a
guess. Because tomorrow when this--or next year, when this goes
into effect, your employer could be determined not to be in
compliance by some Federal bureaucrat with the insurance
coverage that your employer is giving you, and thus, a married
couple who has insurance today could end up being forced to pay
this tax penalty because they don't comply, their insurance
doesn't comply, with what the Federal Government determines is
appropriate; isn't that correct?
Ms. SEVERINO. Yes, and actually, given some of the
religious freedom concerns that are involved in the mandatory
coverage as well, we may be facing that situation----
Mr. TIBERI. So this is potentially much bigger, depending
on what the Federal Government determines what is an
appropriate level of coverage; not just this 2 percent, could
apply to people who have insurance today and are happy with
that insurance.
Ms. SEVERINO. That is correct.
Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Dellinger, I have got to go there, too.
Let's just assume that I have a gas-guzzling SUV and you
have an electric-powered wonderful automobile, and a future
Congress determines, you know what, I am a bad guy because I am
contributing to a very poor environment with my gas-guzzling
SUV, and society is paying for that, while you, I determine as
a future Congress, are complying and are paying for my sin.
Couldn't I, as a Congress, under this provision--I would
love to hear what others have to say--say, you know what, we
are going to penalize Mr. Tiberi for driving a gas-guzzling
SUV. And we are going to install a penalty of--we will make it
low at first, $10,000, to buy an SUV. Isn't that true under
this proposal, under this ruling?
Mr. DELLINGER. Sure.
Mr. TIBERI. Sure?
Mr. DELLINGER. Well, not under this ruling.
Mr. TIBERI. No, under the Chief Justice's ruling.
Mr. DELLINGER. I understand that. But it is true that that
is correct under the Chief Justice's ruling.
Mr. TIBERI. Thank you.
Mr. DELLINGER. But it would have also been correct before
the Chief Justice's ruling.
Mr. TIBERI. I would like.
Mr. DELLINGER. If I may answer the question. Congress may
make my tax bill----
Mr. TIBERI. He answered it. He answered it. I only have a
limited amount of time.
Chairman CAMP. Mr. Tiberi has the time.
Mr. TIBERI. I would like the other three to comment as
well. Yes or no answers.
Mr. CASEY. Ah, yes.
Ms. SEVERINO. Yes they do.
Mr. BRADBURY. Yes.
Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Levin mentioned earlier about Social
Security, and we are all forced to pay Social Security, and
that is not true. There are police officers, firefighters, city
workers, township trustees, township workers, State workers,
library workers, public university workers, bus drivers in Ohio
that do not pay into Social Security. They pay into a public
employee retirement system.
Mr. LEVIN. Because they have an alternative system. They
have to pay into a system.
Mr. JOHNSON. Order.
Chairman CAMP. Mr. Tiberi has the time.
Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Levin, I was just saying, you said all
Americans pay into Social Security. The State of Ohio has a
different system, and it just came to me as he was saying that,
and I don't know, Mr. Bradbury, if you are familiar with that
system or not in Ohio, maybe Mr. Casey is, since he works for
an Ohio law firm, would this, Mr. Casey, have, would it, would
it make it easier for us on the Ways and Means Committee to
compel those I would argue or have the ability to do it, but
would this make it easier under the Chief Justice's ruling to
allow for us to force those people who are now outside of
Social Security to be put into Social Security?
Mr. CASEY. Well, I think it certainly, you could certainly
conceive of circumstances where that could happen but the fact
is, the way the Chief Justice read the law suggests that if
Congress wanted to achieve something like that and didn't
really necessarily want to have it obvious that that was going
on, that indeed you could do that and the courts would indeed
uphold it.
Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Bradbury, under this ruling, the IRS
obviously is going to be tasked with the charge of making sure
we all comply as Americans to this ruling. They clearly don't
have the ability to offer civil penalties today. They can only
do it, as Mr. Dellinger said, through a refund. How likely is
it that a future Congress under this ruling could impose
criminal penalties through the IRS, further auditing abilities
or other impositions through the Internal Revenue Code?
Mr. BRADBURY. Well, it would simply take a majority of
Congress to do that, and the point of my testimony was the
original CBO estimates of how many will choose to pay the tax I
think are now off kilter, given the court's ruling that there
isn't in fact a direct mandate, and that I think it is logical
to assume that more people under the current low level of tax
assessment in the law will choose, will make a rational
economic decision not to purchase insurance and instead to pay
the tax.
Chairman CAMP. Time has expired.
Mr. McDermott is recognized.
Mr. MCDERMOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Dellinger, I think this is sort of an interesting
hearing because it is the first time I have ever heard the
Republican Party argue for irresponsibility and flagrant
throwing irresponsibility off on somebody else. The party of
individual responsibility is saying here that people should not
be forced, even though we know they are going to get sick, they
should not be forced, and they should be allowed to do whatever
they want.
Have you ever heard before that argument made in any case?
And I would like you to answer Mr. Tiberi, he cut you off
because I think we have, we had that power before the Chief
Justice made the ruling. So please.
Mr. DELLINGER. Right, I think with all due respect to Mr.
Tiberi's question is a good one. Does Congress have the power
to create incentives through its tax against spending power
favoring one kind of automobile over the other? The answer is,
of course, they have always had that power. Whether they do it
in forms of a tax credit for people who buy one kind of vehicle
or a tax penalty on those who don't; economists will tell you
there is no difference. And the government has weighed in
heavily both the Federal Government and the States by taxing
gasoline, by taxing cigarettes.
We have always, the Supreme Court, as I said, even in 1903,
upheld a higher tax on yellow oleo margarine. Those are
decisions entrusted to the Congress, and we may disagree with
those. And the question of whether Congress may use its powers
to enforce the revenue laws in various ways in the future is,
of course, a matter generally entrusted to Congress within the
outer boundaries. What surprises me even more than the argument
that it is a good thing that people not have insurance knowing
that other people have to pay their, their medical costs, what
is even more surprising is the undertone of the hearing that we
should, that Members of Congress want the court to engage in a
much more active second guessing of what Congress does with
respect to this in the future.
Of course, the answer to these questions is Congress could,
if Congress can set a minimum wage of $5 an hour, it can set a
minimum wage of $5,000 an hour. The courts will police the
outer boundaries of that, but the idea that you should expect
or want the courts to get involved in second guessing the
intricacies of the legislation and the incentive system, it
does surprise me to hear so much of that coming from the branch
that is actually entrusted under the Constitution with
principal responsibilities for making those decisions.
Mr. MCDERMOTT. Do you, the charge that the President said,
I will never raise taxes, and could you talk a little bit about
that? Because I, it is a pretty serious charge. The President
said we are not going to raise taxes, and now he has gone out
and done it. They never argued it in the court; they slipped it
by. It was kind of like a slider or a screwball in the court.
Mr. DELLINGER. As I said, it was on the face of the statute
exactly who has to pay what and when, as noted very
effectively, a very small portion of the population will ever
have to pay it.
The President was asked whether it was a tax increase, just
as Governor Romney was asked whether it was a tax increase in
Massachusetts when he had a similar penalty for people who
didn't have coverage. I think both of them are getting a bum
rap, both Governor Romney and President Obama. Because what
they are really saying is, this is like the requirement that
you have automobile insurance if you drive a car. No one says
that when you add that it is a tax increase on the middle class
or anybody else. It is expected that Americans will have, will
choose to have insurance coverage or pay a modest penalty, and
I think to characterize that as a sort of particularly a tax
increase on the middle class is, is unfair both to Governor
Romney and to President Obama, each of whom solved this.
And in Massachusetts, it has been successful. It is a very
effective way to expand coverage so that we have a much more
rational system for paying for health care, one in which people
take responsibility for their own, paying their own health care
bills through their own insurance.
Mr. MCDERMOTT. Does this have anything, any ramification
for State legislatures? I was just thinking as I got in my car
this morning and I put on my seatbelt. I was avoiding a tax. A
cop caught me down at the corner without my seatbelt on it is
$125.
Mr. DELLINGER. States have the same authority in this tax
realm as Congress does, and we have trusted to the elected
representatives at the State level to make these judgements as
well.
Chairman CAMP. All right. Time has expired.
You did pose a question to the panel, Mr. Dellinger, that I
feel compelled to answer. I do think it is a real concern of
this Committee when we see the Congress assuming Federal police
power either under the Commerce Clause or under the taxing
power. That is why we do believe there should have been court
review of this, and you had sort of inquired in a puzzled sort
of way why is the Committee or why are we now suggesting this.
But I will yield now to Mr. Ryan for 5 minutes.
Mr. RYAN. Ms. Severino, I am looking at your testimony, and
the Anti-Injunction Act is what I want to kind of get into
here.
So the court did not use the labels used in the legislation
on constitutionality, but they did use the labels in the
legislation for the Anti-Injunction Act. Help me reconcile
this.
Ms. SEVERINO. Well, it is true that for a law like the
Anti-Injunction Act Congress can define the word ``tax'' to
mean what it wants. It can define the word ``penalty'' to mean
what it wants in that context. That is true. And what Chief
Justice Roberts says, correctly, is that is a Constitutional
matter; we can't just say Congress can call anything whatever
they want and then we will treat it as that. That will just be
ceding the authority of Congress to define its own powers,
which I am puzzled to hear Mr. Dellinger suggesting that we
perhaps should do; just defer to Congress on what it is allowed
to do. No, we need someone other than the foxes guarding the
henhouse, and that is what the court is there for.
The curious thing here is that we found something for both
constitutional purposes that it was a penalty in the analysis
in the Commerce Clause, for example, and that it was
functioning as a tax for constitutional purposes. So that is a
new beast. We would--normally taxes and penalties are seen as
opposed things and the Chief Justice's opinion recognizes that.
Mr. RYAN. That is what I am trying to get at. So we have
this body of rulings of precedents where we have had all of
these delineations between what are penalties and what are
taxes. We have a rich history of that. This is a new bridge
that has been built, correct, on the definition with respect to
core precedents with respect to differences between taxes and
penalties?
Ms. SEVERINO. Yes, there have been cases where the court it
seemed to try and slip in a penalty as a tax, but the court
said, no, no, no, no, Congress can't do that, but it is a
unique case to say this is actually a penalty and it is a tax
for constitutional purposes.
Mr. RYAN. Right. So that is new territory so now that this
is within the taxing power and we seem to be testing limits
here and we don't really know where they are, you know from a
behavioral economic standpoint and the drafters of this bill
really believe in behavioral economics by virtue of the way
they designed this bill, if this is now to be seen as just an
option or a tax, not sort of a social stigma of breaking the
law, you are obviously just going to make a rational economic
decision. You will pay the $695 instead of the more expensive
premiums.
Now, what that means to us--and I think the drafters
probably saw this. And in the Senate Finance Committee, they
had an amendment to lower those penalties because those
penalties were originally set at areas where actuaries said
were necessary to prevent what they called death spiralling,
would prevent only sick people going into the insurance markets
and the insurance subsidies and the healthy people staying out
of it because it is a cheaper thing to do. So they had
penalties set at such high levels.
Well, that is bad politics. So an amendment came in the
Senate Finance Committee to lower that penalty to where it is
now. Now that it is not even a social stigma, it is just some
optional choice, we can't help but conclude this pool will get
filled with sick people. Rates will go up, and therefore, the
subsidies will go up from that, an we believe CBO will probably
take a look at that.
What that means for us here is we will have a choice: Do we
just keep absorbing these much higher Federal outlays for these
higher-priced subsidies because they are a sicker profile of
people, or do we raise the penalty to try and prevent that and
bring in more revenue? That is the choice that this Congress if
this law stays in place will be faced with.
Let me get your take on it, Mr. Bradbury. I see you shaking
your head on this. Does this not, in your view, change the feel
and look of this law as more of just an option than an actual
penalty or violation of the law?
Mr. BRADBURY. I agree with you entirely, Congressman. I was
nodding. That was the point I was trying to make. The Supreme
Court has now made it clear to the whole world that it is not a
direct legal mandate. There is no moral imperative to comply.
It is totally optional. It is just a pure economic decision,
and look, the rate of the tax assessment was set, as you
suggest, at a purposely very low level. So, as for most people,
the cost of insurance is going to be well higher than this tax
penalty. They will make a rational decision not to purchase
insurance and instead to pay the penalty. And under the
guaranteed issue and community rating regulations of the law,
as Congress recognized, the law itself creates a very strong
incentive for people to defer getting insurance and not to get
insurance until they are actually sick, and they need it.
And so you combine those factors together, and you see that
the 1.2 percent could be much higher, and that was the point I
was trying to make. And I would say there is a very big
difference between this what the court has now said what the
Federal law is and the Massachusetts law, where, of course,
with the police power in Massachusetts, the legal mandate is a
real legal mandate, and the tax penalty is a penalty, an
enforcement provision to a moral imperative, a legal, a legal
mandate. So that is because of the police power nature of the
State authority versus the Federal Government.
Mr. RYAN. Thank you.
Chairman CAMP. Thank you.
Mr. Doggett is recognized.
Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
You will recall, Mr. Dellinger, the famous writing of
Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis in his dissent in the New
Ice case back in 1932. We hear it referred to often paraphrased
about the States being a laboratory of democracy. He referred
in his writing to one courageous State. Indeed, in the instant
situation, don't we have one courageous State, that being
Massachusetts, that was the laboratory for democracy, after
which the Affordable Care Act was modeled with reference to
individual responsibility?
Mr. DELLINGER. It is, and the Massachusetts experience is
instructive in another way as well.
Mr. Doggett, if I may, because Mr. Ryan's questions to Mr.
Bradbury raise the point that Mr. Bradbury's testimony that I
actually think is a point that is well taken. What Mr. Bradbury
says, and I think what Congressman Ryan was following up on, is
that there may be fewer people who will sign up for insurance
once the Supreme Court has said that the provision saying that
every individual shall have coverage is not constitutionally
enforceable; it is a legal obligation. So that people will then
be looking at the tax penalty, and they will perhaps as
rational economic actors be weighing the cost and benefits. I
think that is a good point.
We don't know to what extent fewer people will get coverage
because they are told that the, that the exhortation sentence
is no longer possible. But in Massachusetts, they did something
very effective. They had a very effective campaign under
Governor Romney's administration to persuade people that they
should sign up for health insurance, that it was the right
thing to do. They had members of the Boston Red Sox and lots of
other people in Massachusetts saying, I signed up, I signed up,
I have got it. And members of the Boston Red Sox said,
everybody should have health insurance, so that, you know, I
think if we would try to be more positive about this and tell
people yeah, you could make a rational economic decision, that
you are better off paying the penalty than you are getting
health insurance, but, a, you know you wouldn't have health
insurance, you get less effective treatment if you do it, and
when you do get treatment and if you are hit by a bus, other
taxpayers are going to have to, and other patients are going to
have to pay for your health care costs. So, yeah, if you want
to do that, you can do that. You can make a rationale decision.
It basically makes other people the insurers of your medical
care.
But I think we ought to be telling those people, look,
everybody, this whole system will work better if everybody
should get coverage who can afford it. There are hardship
exemptions for those who can't. Those people ought to get
coverage, and there is no reason to--and that makes it work,
that is what makes it work to tell insurance companies they
can't turn down people because of pre-existing conditions.
Mr. DOGGETT. I couldn't agree with you more. And when
people stop hearing that the sky is falling and realize the
immense benefits of this, perhaps we will have the same
experience with this tax that in fact this laboratory of
democracy in Massachusetts has had, where as I understand it,
less than 1 percent of the people have actually been faced with
paying any kind of tax or penalty because most have been
responsible in the very positive, optimistic way that you have
viewed it. And the Massachusetts Affordable Care Act has also
been or the Massachusetts law has been the model for the
Affordable Care Act enforcement mechanism also; has it not?
Mr. DELLINGER. That is correct.
Mr. DOGGETT. I yield 1 minute to Mr. Blumenauer.
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Thank you, Mr. Doggett.
I just wanted to follow up on my friend, Mr. Tiberi's point
about, well, couldn't Congress impose a gas guzzler tax. Well,
actually, the Congress has already imposed a gas guzzler tax.
And when you contrast that with our treatment of electric
vehicles, which pays no Federal gasoline tax, and in addition
gets a tax credit, there is a massive support that this
Congress and the previous administrations, Republican and
Democratic alike, have done. So it is a very significant
adjustment. And if you compare what some poor sole who is
driving a 12-mile-per-gallon beater, because that is all he or
she can afford, versus how they are treated with subsidies for
electric vehicles, it pales in comparison to this modest
penalty that we are talking about here.
I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy for permitting me to
make that point. We already do it, which you were trying to say
to Mr. Tiberi.
Chairman CAMP. Thank you.
I think the difference is, Mr. Blumenauer, that if you buy
a gas guzzler, you pay a tax, and what this would say under
this ruling is, unless you buy a low-mileage vehicle, you will
pay a tax, which is a different, different approach to this
taxing issue.
But Mr. Davis is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. DAVIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to follow-
up on that point as someone who has driven an F-250 Ford pickup
truck for the last 15 years, and there is no electric car that
can haul or carry the things that I carry in my vehicle in
Kentucky in the heartland.
One perspective I would like to explore comes back to this
issue with the policing power and the role of the Federal
Government. Chief Justice Roberts' opinion noted that the
enumerated powers to tax and regulate interstate commerce,
quote, must be read carefully to avoid creating a general
Federal authority akin to the police power. This issue of
taxing inactivity, to Chairman Camp and Chairman Tiberi's
point, is of great concern to me because of the issues that are
raised on a much broader perspective and from our Federal
system. And it also echoes the goals of the Founding Fathers,
who during the early debate over the Constitution's meaning
sought to limit, quote, ``the power of levying taxes,'' closed
quote, from becoming, quote, ``a distinct power,'' closed
quote, rather than one limited by other powers in the words of
Roger Sherman.
The author of the Constitution, James Madison, echoed the
same point that the taxing power was limited to the enumerated
powers described in the rest of Article I, Section 8. There has
been a lot of discussion among legal scholars since the Supreme
Court's ruling as to whether this limitation stands and the
degree to which there is any limitation on the taxing power.
I would like to invite the witnesses to provide their
thoughts on this matter, but before going into that, since
there has been so much talk about the automotive industry and
the purchase of cars, you know, we saw a very interesting
overturning of 100 years of commercial law with preferred
creditors with the Chrysler and General Motors bailouts. I
happen to live in a State where Ford and Toyota did not
participate in that and have come out on the side of this very
successfully.
The bigger question here is, couldn't we in fact impose a
penalty under these powers that would mandate the purchase of
certain vehicles to benefit constituencies that help the
executive branch, help a particular political party, can drive
the economic debate in a way that removes the freedom of choice
of the American people with these compulsions through increased
or punitive taxation or what in effect is a form of police
power.
But I would like to have you comment if you would on what
this means to the future of jurisprudence. I see this as a
great hinge and turning point and what the Constitution is
going to mean in the next 100 years. Mr. Casey?
Mr. CASEY. Yeah. I think you raised very important issues.
And I think it is important to make clear that the reason this
decision is scary has nothing to do with health care. It has
nothing to do with the amount of tax that people may or may not
pay. The fact of the matter is this law was not passed as a
tax; on the face of the law, it is not a tax. It does not use
the language of tax. Congress, God knows, knows how to raise a
tax when it wants to. There is a page and a half of findings in
the law referencing the Commerce Clause.
In order to uphold the law because the court agreed that
passing this under the Commerce Clause would indeed involve the
creation of Federal police power, which is impermissible, the
court rewrote the law to create a tax, and that is what is so
scary, first of all, because that is not what Congress meant to
do, and second of all, because in doing so, it suggested that
the kinds of taxes Congress can pass are far broader than we
ever thought before.
Mr. DAVIS. Ms. Severino, you made a comment about alluding
to religious discrimination. I think of the Catholic health
care system right now under these powers as being compelled to
support practices that fly in the face of the biblical
principles that they choose to uphold under their First
amendment rights. Would you care to comment on this issue?
Ms. SEVERINO. Certainly. I think it is just another
category of people and organizations that may be forced into
paying these taxes and not just having their employees paying
the individual mandate penalty perhaps but also the employer
penalties because of a heretofore unseen expansion into
religious freedom. Even the Clinton health care bill had an
exemption for religious freedom far broader than the very
cramped narrow reading of the exemptions we see in the current
law. And it is unfortunate to see that implication.
And if I can comment one other point on the Federal versus
the State powers, we are not just sitting here talking about
wolves at the door, as Ranking Member Levin called it, because
our concern is that, not to, not to, I guess, call the Members
of Congress wolves, but effectively what this has done is
remove the door. We have a Constitution as a barrier preventing
the government from overtaking more power than it was designed
to have. The Founders were concerned about that. Our concern is
that, that the court has effectively removed the door should
wolves come, should a government that decides to expand its
power beyond an appropriate reach come, now we no longer have
those constitutional boundaries.
Mr. DAVIS. Well, for example, on that point and coming back
to this issue of police powers of the State, there is an
interesting case in New Mexico right now that has been
prosecuted against the----
Chairman CAMP. I am afraid time has expired.
Mr. DAVIS. Okay. I will yield back.
Chairman CAMP. All right.
Mr. Thompson is recognized.
Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Dellinger, during the course of the debate on the
Affordable Care Act, I met with a number of people from my
district who were hurt by the fact that they had lifetime caps
on their insurance, people with pre-existing conditions who
couldn't get insurance, parents of little kids who their kids
had very serious medical conditions, and they have run up
against the lifetime cap, and they are just 100 percent exposed
with no help.
I met with a young man after passage of the bill who was a
hemophiliac, and he is now--the lifetime cap is not a problem
for him any more. Matter of fact, he started his own business
and has hired employees. I have commercial fishermen in my
district, the north coast of California, who since 1981 have
been denied access to health care because of some port
hospital, port physician issues. They have had to go out into
the private sector and buy their insurance, and quite honestly
can't. They are over the top on passage of this bill that
finally after all of these years they are going to be able to
get coverage.
In my district, we had an uncompensated care cost of $50
million last year, and I am told that that, that works out to
be about $1,000 per person who buys insurance that they have to
pay more. You could call it a tax, I guess, on the people who
already have insurance.
Those three groups of people that I mentioned, do you think
they are home right now fretting over whether or not this is a
tax?
Mr. DELLINGER. Well, I think, Mr. Thompson, that is, that
is such a well-taken point because it is really astounding to
me how few people understand the enormous benefits of this
legislation, all of which would have been taken down had the
court ruled as dissenting Members, where the entire law would
have been gone. The freedom from caps for your hemophiliac
constituent, the ability to be covered by your parents' policy,
the right to get insurance even though you have had asthma or
some other pre-existing condition; all of that would have gone
down.
And when I say I think the concern about, about what
Congress may do with its tax powers, I understand Ms.
Severino's point about the importance of judicial review. We
have used it to protect religious minorities. We have used it
to protect freedom of speech. But the courts have been really
hesitant of second-guessing the area of budgeting and finance
and taxing and spending and instead have thought within large
boundaries those judgments need to be left to the people that
are out there every day talking to their constituents. You know
things and your colleagues on the other side know things that
Justices don't know sitting in the Supreme Court about how hard
it has been for people who could not afford to see a doctor and
who couldn't get health care for their child when they were
sick. You understand those things in a way that the court does
not, and that is why I think it is appropriate for the court to
defer to you in making these kinds of judgements.
Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you.
I mentioned the $50 million in uncompensated care in my
district and translates out to $1,000 per person who buys
insurance. The national number is $100 billion in uncompensated
care. So I would assume that if you extrapolate, that is $1,000
per every person who has insurance. So if you are going to
argue the tax stuff, I think it is probably only fair to point
out that is a $100 billion worth of tax cuts that, that
appropriate health care coverage will provide the American
people.
And our colleague, Mr. Doggett, pointed out that it is
about time we get away from ``the sky is falling'' on health
care and start figuring out how to, how to rub off some of the
warts that are on the bill and make it an even better bill.
This is, this is so important to so many people, and yet we are
spending time ad nauseam trying to pick it apart, piece by
piece. I think this week we are going to have our 31st or 32nd
vote on the repeal of either all or part of the health care
reform legislation. We need to get away from this. We need to
make sure that we all remember why it started.
This was in response to a national crisis, a national
crisis. Businesses, individuals who couldn't afford the health
care costs. The ever-rising costs of health care. And the many
millions of people who couldn't get health care and were
suffering as a result of that, of that national crisis. We
stepped up. We did something about it. I think everybody will
admit that it is a work in progress. There is more that we need
to do, and we ought to get on with doing that part of it rather
than having this little pick-it-apart session such as the one
we are having today.
I yield back.
Chairman CAMP. Mr. Reichert is recognized.
Mr. REICHERT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Here we go again discussing another false statement that
was told to the American people in order to sell the health
care law. First, they said if you like your health care plan,
you can keep it. Well, we know that is no longer true. And last
week, the statement that was made that the mandate is a penalty
and not a tax was overruled by the Supreme Court.
And so, Mr. Dellinger, I would like to just comment on a
couple of statements you made.
First, the answer to the is it a tax or an indirect tax or
indirect tax or a penalty.
The Congressman going fishing or the fisherman who is the
Congressman fishing, the bottom fact here is the line is in the
water. The government can call it a tax or a penalty, but the
American people I don't think are fretting whether or not it is
called a tax or a penalty. All they know is that the Federal
Government has its hand in their pocket, and I don't think they
are too happy about that. They want jobs.
And the point that this is, this is a 2,700-page bill plus.
I don't think we are picking it apart. We are just trying to
learn a little bit more about it, trying to find out what is in
it. We are kind of doing what Nancy Pelosi told us to do; read
the bill, find out what is in, it after it was passed,
unfortunately.
So, Mr. Dellinger also made a comment that this 1 percent
of this tax doesn't affect Medicare, Medicare Advantage, but in
fact, really Medicare, Medicare Advantage are taking a $523
billion cut; $200 billion just to Medicare Advantage. Where are
those seniors going to go? They have got to go to a personal
policy. Well, the personal policy after 2013 will no longer, by
this law, allow people to enroll in new policies. They are also
going to be limited on the amount of insurance they can have
added to that policy. So where are they going to be finally
driven out of the personal insurance policy?
And you also mentioned it is not going to impact the
employer insurance providers. Well, they have already been
impacted. They are not providing insurance to some of their
employees because they have discovered it is too expensive.
So I think all of those facts lead to the bottom line, and
that is there are going to be more than 1 percent of Americans
affected by this tax, which of course then leads you to all of
the next things that will happen. Costs will go up; that is a
yes. Democrats in Congress will seek to force these people to
buy health coverage, yes, because they will need that money to
pay for the rest of the health care bill. Could this include
significantly increasing the individual mandate tax? Yes. Then
you can't take this and just talk about this tax.
But let us just talk about all of the other taxes. There is
a--there is a 3.8 percent tax on employers. There is a 2.3
percent tax on medical devices. There is a tax on the 1099 form
that fortunately we were able to get the Democrats to agree
with that was removed from the law. There is a 40 percent tax
on Cadillac, so-called Cadillac health care plans. There is a
$2,000 penalty on employers if they don't provide insurance.
There is another $3,000 tax penalty on employers who provide a
plan that is deemed to be too good or too expensive. The list
goes on and on and on.
Maybe what we should do is tax AARP because in this plan
that they helped write, AARP stands to gain $1 billion in
revenue over the next 10 years. Maybe they need to be taxed
instead of the American people.
One of the questions I have is, you know, as we look at the
penalties applied here, would there be a penalty applied if
someone who is filling out their IRS form checks the box, yes,
I have had insurance the entire year, and they haven't?
Mr. BRADBURY. Yes. I mean, under current law, 18 USC 1001,
a knowing misrepresentation to the Federal Government is a
felony.
Mr. REICHERT. Lying to the IRS. That is current law. They
check the box. They don't have insurance. I am sure there will
be some people that do that. The penalty for that, would you
happen to know what the penalty for lying to the IRS? It varies
I know.
Mr. BRADBURY. Well, I believe it is the general 1001
criminal penalty. It is a felony so it is subject to a high
financial penalty and also prison time.
Mr. REICHERT. What happens if they don't check the box at
all?
Mr. BRADBURY. Well----
Mr. REICHERT. Who is going to follow up on that? Where do
the IRS agents come from? How much is that going to cost? I
know you can't answer those questions.
And Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Chairman CAMP. All right. Thank you.
Mr. Blumenauer is recognized.
All right.
Mr. Lewis.
Mr. LEWIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, I have been listening to the discussion
today, and I tell you, it seems that we have lost focus on what
really matters, whether it is a tax or a penalty on people who
fail to take individual responsibility doesn't matter. Every
American who can afford to buy health insurance must buy
insurance, and if you can't afford it, the Affordable Care Act
will pay, will help you pay for it. That is amazing progress on
a country that has been trying to provide health care to all
Americans.
We should not lose sight on the fact there are people
suffering in our country. Over 12 million people still looking
for jobs, wondering if they will lose their homes, whether they
will be able to put food on their tables.
We also have over 50 million people who do not have health
insurance. Some of them are unemployed, but the vast majority
of them are working hard each and every day and simply can't
afford health insurance. They, too, are worrying whether they
are one illness away from disaster.
I believe that this Congress and the President of the
United States, President Barack Obama, took a historic step to
expand health coverage by passing the Affordable Care Act.
Working together, we can assure every American--we cannot
afford to turn the clock back on the progress that was made.
The Affordable Care Act has already made unbelievable progress.
Mr. Chairman, I must say, in all honesty, that I believe
that this hearing today is a political stunt just like
tomorrow's repeal vote. Repealing the Affordable Care Act would
mean 17 million children with pre-existing conditions who will
be denied coverage by insurance company. I want to know right
now whether any member of this panel support allowing insurance
companies to once again deny health insurance to children who
are unlucky enough to get sick.
Ms. DELLINGER. Mr. Lewis, could I comment on that?
Mr. LEWIS. Yes, Ms. Dellinger.
Ms. DELLINGER. To me, this is I think one of the four great
pieces of social legislation enacted in the past century. It
completes the set of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and
the Affordable Care Act. And when I sat in the Supreme Court
and listened to the arguments at the end of March, I was struck
by the fact that every Justice, every law clerk, every one of
the State attorneys general, everyone arguing on both sides and
everyone in that courtroom not only had health insurance, they
wouldn't dream of going without it. And it seemed incredibly
strange to me to hear people talking about this new liberty in
not having health insurance when there is not a single person
in the room debating those issues who would dream of going
without health insurance.
Mr. LEWIS. Other Members of the panel.
Mr. CASEY. Well, I would say that the question, again, the
question you raise is a good one, which is should Congress
attempt to provide for those who cannot afford health insurance
for themselves? And there are good arguments that it should.
The question is how. And the question is how your power is
exercised and the question is how the court will permit you to
exercise your power.
And this decision takes that, the balance created by the
Constitution and the Framers and it unbalances it, and that is
the problem with it, not the question of who should be covered
and not.
Ms. SEVERINO. Yes, I agree, with respect, Representative
Lewis, I think this is an important question, and it is not, as
Mr. Dellinger called it, a nomenclature battle that is
ultimately unfruitful. It is--the Constitution's limits on our
government are very important. We don't have a Federal
Government that just has the mandate to go and do good but that
there are enumerated powers, and just as it is very important
the nomenclature of whether something is speech and therefore
is protected by the First amendment or whether protection is
actually equal and therefore permitted under the 14th
Amendment, it is very important whether our constitutional
limits are being respected here and whether this is actually a
tax and what the taxing power means.
Mr. BRADBURY. Congressman Lewis, the problem that Congress
faced, and it recognized it when it passed the law, was that
to, to require guaranteed issue and community rating in all of
the insurance policies in order to achieve greater access to
insurance coverage, Congress recognized that was inevitably
going to cause the cost of insurance to go up. And it was going
to incentivize more people to drop insurance. And so that was
really the dilemma that Congress faced, and that is why the
mandate was added to try to force people to buy insurance in
order to lower the costs of insurance for others and to avoid
the moral hazard of causing more and more people to go without
insurance. So it was a real attempt at a balance.
And the problem we now face is that the court has said, you
can't mandate it directly. It is really a tax. And the question
is will it work.
Chairman CAMP. Time has expired.
Mr. Marchant is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. MARCHANT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I would like to discuss the part of the argument that we
have not discussed yet this morning and that was the
interpretation of the Supreme Court of the States'
responsibility in the mandate as it related to the expansion of
the Medicaid and the Medicare because when we all go back home
now, our State legislators and our Governors are most
interested in the mandates that were placed on those
governments because, in fact, although part of the--the bill,
part of the law was declared a tax, the expansion of Medicaid
to the States is always going to have been a tax because the
States were going to have to come up with hundreds of millions
of dollars to, in their matching amounts, to match the
expansion. And the only way those States could pay for that
would be to absorb that cost and pass that down to their
taxpayers.
So, in many ways, Obamacare, has always been a tax on many
States.
The court chose to address the personal mandate and said it
is not a personnel mandate. It is in fact a tax. But then they
went on to discuss the responsibility or the mandate on the
States. So I would like to have your view of the ramifications
of that constitutional change or that interpretation, Mr.
Bradbury.
Mr. BRADBURY. Thank you. Yeah, I think it is a very
significant ruling. Seven Members of the court recognized that
there really is teeth to the idea that under the spending
power, Congress cannot go so far as to coerce States into
agreeing to regulations that Congress is imposing through its
cooperative spending programs. And here what the court held is
can't force States to accept the expansion of Medicaid at the
peril of losing all of the pre-existing Medicaid funding that
the States enjoyed. That could be very significant. The States
now understand, each Governor now understands that the opting
in to the Medicaid expansion is truly an option that States
have, and I think we saw yesterday that another Governor of a
major State has announced that that State, Texas, is not going
to opt in to the Medicaid expansion. So that is a very
significant ruling, raises a lot of interesting questions about
where are the lines that you draw as to what is coercive for
States, and States may have arguments that other aspects of the
Medicaid program or other cooperative Federal State programs
have crossed that line or might cross that line in the future.
So I think it is going to be a rich vein if you will of new
litigation and constitutional development in the court.
The mandate has a lot of implications for State costs, too,
because I think as the States that were in the Supreme Court
made clear, the mandate, if it were a legal mandate that
applied to everybody, not just the people who can afford to buy
insurance and will have to pay the tax, but lower-income people
as well, it was going to cause a lot more people who are
eligible for Medicaid to opt in to actually choose to subject
themselves to Medicaid or become a patient under Medicaid, and
that was going to increase the costs to States very greatly.
They recognized that. Unclear now whether that is going to
happen or to what extent that will happen because we now know
it is not a mandate that applies to those people. It is just a
tax that applies to people with a little bit higher income who
can afford to buy.
Mr. MARCHANT. So one of the major premises of the
Affordable Health Care Act was that it would force many more,
millions more people into the system, which would create a
larger pool, which would in effect create a smaller premium or
a savings in premium. But, in fact, as a result of both of
these rulings, it is probably going to have a result of a
significant, millions less people participating. And so the
premise that this Affordable Care Act would lower premiums is
probably going to be erased. And the Federal Government in fact
may be building on what Chairman Ryan said, what will probably
happen is that since there is no savings, it will, the system
will create significant deficits to be implemented.
Mr. MARCHANT. And those deficits will have to be covered by
cutting spending or raising taxes, and that responsibility will
fall completely on the Congress. And, Mr. Dellinger, do you
agree that this will complicate this, the whole theory of more
people participating.
Chairman CAMP. Answer quickly, because time has expired.
Mr. DELLINGER. I do believe it will complicate it,
particularly if Governors take what to me would be an
extraordinary step of declining the expanded Medicaid funding
which will help the working poor afford insurance. If they are
unable in States that actually turn down the expanded Medicaid
support, I think it will have adverse affects on what the
anticipations were.
Chairman CAMP. All right. Thank you.
Mr. Crowley is recognized.
Mr. CROWLEY. I thank the chairman very much.
I have heard references made of the Congress as wolves and
foxes. I have been called worse in my district, quite frankly,
so I appreciate the----
What I would suggest, though, is the possibility the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights was put in place to prevent
a dictatorship. And this is the people's House. And I think
when the House and the Senate come to an agreement on
legislation that has passed and has been signed by the
President, I think this is the way the Founders of our country
envisioned our government would work.
Despite the fact that my colleagues on the other side gave
no vote in favor of this, the majority of the people of the
House of Representatives did, and they were elected by the
people. And, subsequent to that, we have had elections, and
they have made themselves known once again, and they will have
an opportunity once again this fall to do so. And I anticipate
they will also let their feelings be known collectively in that
election.
What I find really interesting about this discussion
today--and I appreciate having this hearing. I hope we have
many, many more hearings like this at some point. Because I
think the more we talk about the legislation the more we
understand it. I think that is very accurate. One of my
colleagues on this side--I think Mr. Reichert said that. That
is true. But I do think it is also frustrating to the American
people.
I just came from a trip to Montana, where my in-laws are
from, hard-working ranching family from Billings, Montana,
struggling. My kids are out there. We call it Camp Montana.
They get to ride horses and help bring the cattle in.
Unfortunately, this year they had to bring the cattle in a
little early because the market has dropped out for the cattle
industry in Montana.
So my kids have a great time, but my in-laws who are
brutally struggling every day to make ends meet, it is not as
much fun for them. And they are wondering what is the Congress
doing to help them today.
And my constituents back home in Woodside, Queens, and in
Pelham and the Bronx, they are asking the exact same question:
What, Congress, are you doing to help fix this economy? What
are you doing to create jobs in America?
And, instead--and I hope we have more of those hearings; I
think it is wonderful--we are discussing a bill that became
law, was passed by the President, enacted, and the judicial
review is done, and they have found this law to be
constitutional. Yet we still continue to talk about it and to
berate Obamacare.
By the way, I don't call it Obamacare. I think that is a
pejorative. It is President Obamacare. I think what the
President has done here is something that has perplexed our
country for over a century and Presidents before him who have
tried to fix or help this problem. He should be credited for
the advancements that we have made.
Now I have heard the reference made to two particular
points, fishing licenses or the right to fish or the ability to
fish and the other is to own a car or the requirement to own a
car. Now can each and every one of you tell me, is there a
requirement that any American by State law or the Federal law
are required to own a car? Yes or no?
Mr. BRADBURY. No.
Ms. SEVERINO. No.
Mr. CASEY. No.
Mr. DELLINGER. No.
Mr. CROWLEY. Is any American required to own a fishing
license?
Mr. BRADBURY. No.
Ms. SEVERINO. No.
Mr. CASEY. No.
Mr. DELLINGER. No.
Mr. CROWLEY. My understanding is that that doesn't exist.
Now will every American at some point become ill?
Ms. SEVERINO. Not necessarily but very likely.
Mr. CROWLEY. Not necessarily, but for the most part would
you say yes? Likelihood?
Ms. SEVERINO. Certainly.
Mr. CROWLEY. Certainly. Would you all agree?
[Nonverbal response.]
Mr. CROWLEY. So--would you all agree? Yes, sir?
So here we are--nuance. No one requires anyone to get a
fishing license. No one requires anyone to buy a car.
Is there a requirement involved in getting sick? How does
that happen? How do people get sick? Does anyone know?
Mr. CASEY. Um----
Mr. CROWLEY. Who does this to us? Does the State do it
medically? Does the Federal Government require people to become
ill?
Mr. CASEY. No.
Mr. CROWLEY. Do they require them to become ill?
Mr. CASEY. No.
Mr. CROWLEY. So the reality is, whether we like it or not,
unless you live in a remote part of Alaska by yourself and
chose to do so and you live in a log cabin that you have built
and you kill what you eat and you wear what you kill and you
live somewhere where no one will ever know you exist, in all
likelihood you will need some type of health care.
That is the nuance here. That is what I don't think people
understand. Getting sick is not an option. You get sick. It is
not like you get an option to buy a car. If you want to do it,
you can do it. But no one requires you. That is the nuance here
the American people don't understand. We are talking about
something that will happen.
And I think, once again, we are not talking turkey enough
to the American People. We are talking in the abstract. The
reality is they will get sick, and if they do get sick and they
go to the hospital and they don't pay for it, we pay for it.
My wife says, why do we get insurance? Why don't we just go
to the hospital and have someone else pay for our insurance?
Because it is not individually responsible. That is why.
That is why we don't do it. It is not--it is a lack of
individual responsibility.
Mr. BRADY [presiding]. The gentleman's time has expired.
Mrs. BLACK.
Mrs. BLACK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
It has been a very good discussion today, and I appreciate
the fact that our chairman brought us together to discuss these
very important issues.
As a nurse for over 30--over 40 years--boy, I am really
starting to know those years now--there is no doubt that we
have the best health care in this world. And I know that
because I have done medical mission work in other places like
Haiti and Guatemala where, yes, they are said to have care.
That it is care you can get. But, believe me, when you go into
those hospitals, that is not the kind of care we want here.
So our system is broken because we have difficulty with
everybody having access to it. But there are alternatives
beside the alternative that we got in this 2,700 page document.
And having been, as I say, in this field for a long time, I
think things like strengthening our health departments, which
have deteriorated over the years because of various things that
have happened--I won't go into those--but removing the barriers
of purchasing health insurance across State lines, giving
people more opportunity, more tools, more competition, those
are various things that can be done beyond what was done in
this 2,700 page document.
So I am going to just put that aside for a moment. Because
over this past week I did read the entire ruling, and it did
concern me. I am not an attorney, but, as I read, what really
concerned me, especially in the dissenting opinion, was the
fact that we are now taxing an inactivity.
And I think out of everything that I read in that document
that was the thing that scared me the very most, is that, as
has already been said in here, there have been incentives to be
given to people to encourage their behavior, such as maybe a
tax incentive to buy a certain kind of car or other such
things, but it has always been as a result of something that
you actually did, an activity.
So this inactivity now, to be able to tax inactivity, what
I would like for each of you to tell me is has there ever been
in our law a precedent such as this where you tax inactivity?
And from what I read according to the dissenting opinion that
is no, but I do want to hear that from each of you.
Second to that, from your opinion, where do you see this
going? Does this really create Federal policing power? Is there
a limit? Where is the limit?
Because I think we have only seen the beginning of that.
Whereas, as already has been said, if you didn't eat just what
the government thinks you should eat because that will make a
better society that we have a right now to tax that.
So two things there. Is there anything else you can think
of that is an inactivity that we already tax; and, second to
that, where is the limit?
Mr. Bradbury, let's begin with you.
Mr. BRADBURY. Thank you, Congresswoman.
I can't think of another example. So I do think it is
unprecedented, as far as I know, anyway.
And, second, as to the what the limit is, well, first of
all, there is a political accountability limit when Congress is
passing a tax. But if Congress can pass something and say, oh,
this is not a tax and then have the Court later uphold it as a
tax, well, then that undercuts that limit.
And the Court previously has not been clear as to the
constitutional limits of the taxing power. It is very broad.
Clearly, it is. So, at a minimum, we have to say it is very
unclear, it is ill-defined, and perhaps the sky is the limit.
And so it is just limited by the creativity of Congress, I
think.
Mrs. BLACK. Ms. Severino.
Ms. SEVERINO. I agree. This is an unprecedented tax on
inactivity. I think that is what makes it a little bit
different from what Representative Crowley was talking about.
The car and fishing license examples aren't perfect analogies.
Because in those cases you are engaging in some activity. This
is a tax on not engaging in activity.
And as philosophers going back to Aristotle I believe could
tell you, there is a difference--despite how an economist may
analyze things, there is a difference between taking action and
failing to take action as a philosophical matter. So I, too, am
concerned about the fact that this eliminates some of the
limits on our government.
Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Casey.
Mr. CASEY. Yeah, I am unaware of any precedent that is like
this one.
I will say where it goes I don't think any of us actually
know, but it could go very far. For example, Mr. Crowley
mentioned a moment ago that his relatives or friends in Montana
are in the cattle industry, and it is down. Well, one way
Congress could fix that problem is require us all to all buy a
certain amount of beef or pay a tax. We never thought that
Congress could do that before, but now that you know you can,
that is scary.
Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Dellinger.
Mr. DELLINGER. I am not afraid, Mrs. Black, because
Congress has always had the power, at least for the last
century or more, to influence what people buy and don't buy by
use of the taxing power. State and Federal Governments have
encouraged or discouraged purchases by use of the tax power.
The Court in 1903 could have decided it was going to try to
police that from the judiciary, and they decided to leave that
to Congress, and I think that is where it ought to be left.
Chairman CAMP [presiding]. Thank you.
Mr. Neal is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. NEAL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, one of the points I would like to raise here,
as Mr. Dellinger has noted, Social Security was a compromise.
Essentially, Roosevelt began by looking for something grander,
and Republicans or nothing, and the compromise was the payroll
tax.
And Medicare wasn't quite what Johnson wanted. He wanted it
to be--President Johnson wanted it to be more extended--having
just finished the fourth volume of the Caro series--to note how
that was done.
But the practical side of this bears noting. In the State
of Massachusetts, 64 percent of the voters are either
Republicans or Independents; and the health care plan in
Massachusetts polls north of 70 percent in terms of customer
satisfaction. It was negotiated between business and labor and
arguably the best hospitals in the world. And now the next step
in this deliberation is on to a global payment system which his
State is about to adopt.
The magnificence of the picture of the photograph, the day
that Mitt Romney signed the legislation has Ted Kennedy
standing behind him. To the right, of course, is the American
flag; and in front of the American flag a Member of the
Heritage Foundation, who, as Senator Chafee and Senator Dole
both argued, that was the Republican answer to Clintoncare. And
all of a sudden it can't be the answer to Obamacare.
The point is that the plan has worked. I don't know anybody
in Massachusetts who doesn't think perhaps you have to sand the
edges here and there, but I don't know anybody who is talking
about repealing the legislation.
And we have this conversation here that the country,
frankly, has moved beyond about tax versus penalty. Most of us
who have been elected here we understand the trim line. That
argument is over. That was taken care of. So it is nice to have
witnesses come in and espouse esoteric views interpreting what
the Chief Justice said or what the minority Members of the
Court said, but the truth is we have moved on from that.
Mr. Dellinger, you appear anxious to comment on that. Would
you do so?
Mr. DELLINGER. Your remarks, Mr. Neal, make me reflect on
the extraordinary process by which this legislation was
demonized. I understand very much the liberty concerns that no
one should be forced into a commercial transaction with a
private company. That is why I have always thought it important
to see this as a mere financial incentive to do so. And where
the Court said the reason we think it is constitutionally valid
is it really affords people a perfectly reasonable choice. If
you want to make a payment to the government instead of having
private insurance, you can choose to do so, if that is where
you are going to go.
But what is extraordinary is when Massachusetts adopted
this system which, as you say, is very popular in
Massachusetts, it expanded coverage--health insurance coverage
to record levels. The hospitals are extremely pleased with it.
The Boston Red Sox supported it.
What is interesting is that none of the people that are
saying that, quote, Obamacare is the end of liberty as we know
it rushed to Massachusetts or became excited that one of our
States had gone totally rogue and adopted some unthinkable
program. When Massachusetts did this, it was generally approved
of and thought well of.
If one of our States had really done something that was the
end of liberty as we know it, you would think it would have
caused more of a ruckus than it did. In fact, it was widely
approved; and Governor Romney himself said, rightly, I think,
that it should be a model for where we need to go as a nation.
If we want to afford more private choice rather than have a
single-payer system, that is the way to go.
I have always thought that the demonization of it was quite
striking in light of the comments you make about how relatively
well it worked in Massachusetts.
Mr. NEAL. If I could, Mr. Chairman, without objection, I
would like to enter into the record an article entitled
Massachusetts Web Site Calls Mitt Romney's Health Care Mandate
a Tax Penalty, a copy of the Massachusetts official Web site,
and the Massachusetts session laws signed by Mitt Romney
setting forth the tax penalty.
Chairman CAMP. Without objection.

Mr. NEAL. Last, Mr. Dellinger, do you agree that Romneycare
and Obamacare have the same enforcement mechanism? And if one
is a tax, are they both?
Mr. DELLINGER. I think that is fair enough.
Mr. NEAL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman CAMP. I would just say, Mr. Dellinger, there is a
difference between the States and the Federal Government in
terms of police power. So the analogy between what
Massachusetts did and there was not this outcry and what the
Federal Government may have done and there is an outcry is
because of the limited enumerated powers of the Federal
Government. Our Founders were concerned about a too powerful
Federal Government. So I just think it is important to make
that point.
Mr. Berg is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. BERG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding
this.
And thank you to the panelists. It is a long morning here
but appreciate your being here. It has been a good debate.
Obviously, as we talked, the Supreme Court ruled the
individual mandate is constitutional. It is interesting and it
is not through the Commerce Clause and makes sense from a tax
standpoint.
I just want to kind of get back full circle back to Mr.
Bradbury. When we talk about the people that will be affected,
can you sum that up again? I know we have been over it several
times, but----
Mr. BRADBURY. Congressman, as I understand it, about 160
million income tax forms are filed that will be subject to the
declaration: Did you have insurance for yourself, your spouse,
and all of your dependents for each month during the year? So
it is going to affect all of those people in the sense that if
they wish to make an independent economic decision to drop
whatever insurance they have they will be subject to the
penalty, and they are certainly subject to the requirement to
check this certification.
Then you can focus on the people who are currently
projected under the law that was originally enacted will not
have insurance and will be subject to the tax penalty. That is
the 4 million people.
But the point I am trying to make is now that we understand
from the court's decision that it is not a legal mandate that
thou shalt have insurance as a matter of Federal law, instead,
it is an economic choice, and the penalty provision or the tax
as now we understand it is lower for most people than the cost
of insurance policy, more people could be expected to make a
rational decision to pay the penalty and not to purchase
insurance or perhaps to drop the insurance that they have if it
turns out that it is going to up in cost.
So we don't know what those numbers are. CBO will take a
new look at it, I am sure. I cannot assess. I am not a
government accountant. But it is logical to assume that the
number of people who will actually pay the tax and not buy
insurance will be higher than was originally assessed by CBO.
Mr. BERG. I would like to drill into that a little bit.
Because I think most of the taxes that we have done are an
incentive. We affected behavior by taxation, but it has kind of
lowered that cost for an alternative. We have never kind of
taxed inactivity.
And I just sit here and I struggle with unless someone's
tax is equal to their health care costs there is almost a
question of whether or not they will move more toward the
penalty, as you said, Mr. Bradbury, versus paying health care.
Because, clearly, there is a dramatic difference on those
people whose income would be much lower with the 2 and a half
percent tax.
I just see this, and I don't know if it has been talked
about or thought through, but I just see a lot of people
saying, you know what? I will never be denied health care, so I
will pay the tax. You know what? I am not even going to pay the
tax. Because I am not withholding much income or income tax.
And maybe I have a job, maybe I am in an environment where I am
not withholding, and then when I get sick I am going to go
online and I am going to sign up for the insurance.
I think to some degree that discourages people from getting
regular health care as well, and there may be a bigger--I don't
know--a bigger cost that people aren't anticipating just
because of the dynamics. The trade-off--there is too much
disparity there.
Would you like to comment on that at all?
Mr. BRADBURY. I think that is absolutely right. That is the
point I tried to make in the testimony.
I think what we have to understand is underlying that is
the other regulations in the legislation that were passed--
perhaps for very meritorious policy reasons; I am not
questioning--but those other regulations are going to cause--as
Congress recognizes, are going to cause the cost of health
insurance to go up and will create incentives for more people
to drop insurance because they can wait until they get sick and
they are guaranteed a reasonably priced policy relative to what
they would otherwise expect.
So it is that incentive and those higher costs that the
mandate was intended to address by forcing everybody in to
purchase insurance to try to subsidize the cost for others and
also to avoid this adverse selection or moral hazard of people
dropping insurance.
Now if Congress sees that that is not working and the cost
problems that the regulations are going to create are causing
this death spiral as people have suggested, then the obvious
recourse Congress could adopt under the Supreme Court's
decision is to raise the tax, is to make it more coercive to
force people to do what Congress said was important to force
them to do, which is to go out into the market and buy health
insurance.
So the tax could go well above the cost of the health
insurance policy. There is nothing that says as a
constitutional matter it has to be capped by the average cost
of insurance policy. It could be set way higher in order to
force people economically into the market. So the result could
end up being the same if Congress were to go down that road.
Mr. BERG. Thank you. I yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman CAMP. Mr. Becerra is recognized.
Mr. BECERRA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman; and thank you to all
of you for your patience and indulgence in these questions that
we have been asking. It has been an interesting hearing more
because of the types of questions. They are not ``what is''
kind of questions which we typically engage in about what is
the consequence of this, what has happened as a result of what
was done. It is ``what if.'' It is all speculative, things that
may never occur, but you are being asked to tell us what might
happen if the sun doesn't rise tomorrow.
But be that as it may, we had the hearing. And while I wish
we would have focused the hearing on jobs, which is what
Americans really care most about, and certainly for this tax
writing Committee that is an important thing. We could have
tackled the whole question about whether or not we should be
providing tax incentives to companies that ship jobs overseas
and thereby deny Americans the chance to stay at work.
But we are where we are, and we are relitigating once again
what we passed in 2010, what the executive branch and the
President signed into law in 2010, and which just recently now
the Supreme Court has affirmed as a sound law, but we are where
we are.
This penalty for free riders who are looking for a free
lunch, let me ask a question--and, Ms. Severino, let me ask you
this question. You mentioned you have insurance. I have
insurance. Every one of my colleagues at the dais has
insurance. I am fortunate I can afford it. I guess you are
fortunate enough to be able to afford it as well.
If I decide that substantial amount of money I put into my
insurance for myself and for my family I would rather save that
money for something else. So I say I am going to drop my
insurance for myself and for my family. And so by some chance I
end up in the emergency room because of someone hitting me,
broadsiding me, and I am now in the hospital, but I don't have
insurance. Is it right for me to ask you to cover the cost of
my health care bill?
Ms. SEVERINO. Well, unfortunately, the law I believe,
without the mandate function, does exactly that.
Mr. BECERRA. I asked would it be right for me to ask you to
cover my insurance--or the cost of my health care?
Ms. SEVERINO. I think it is fair for you to ask me. I don't
think it is right of you to force me.
Mr. BECERRA. So you wouldn't want to have to pay for my
medical bills at that hospital, would you?
Ms. SEVERINO. I might not. But as a matter of charity I
think we do support a lot of people that--so I may choose as a
charitable endeavor to pay for yours or another needy
person's----
Mr. BECERRA. If I told you it would cost you about a $1,000
to cover my health care bills because I chose not to have
health insurance that I could afford, would you still be
willing to pay that $1,000?
Ms. SEVERINO. It probably depends on the circumstances.
But, you know, there are cases I might.
Mr. BECERRA. You are a very generous person.
Ms. SEVERINO. No, if you were my father-in-law who wouldn't
be able to afford his health insurance, I think I would pony up
the $1,000 for you. Even if I felt like it was a bad choice at
the time.
Mr. BECERRA. I understand that, and I think your father-in-
law probably is enjoying the answer you just gave. I don't
happen to be your father-in-law. I assume then you are either
extremely generous or you are unlike most persons who probably
feel like they could use $1,000 to help to take care of their
own family.
Ms. SEVERINO. There are many cases where I might not pay
the $1,000, yeah.
Mr. BECERRA. I think that is probably the case for a lot of
American families who would say, if I have got health insurance
for my family and I am paying several thousand dollars for it
and if you can afford to do the same thing but you are not
willing to, I can't find any reason why I should be asked to
pay for your health care when you can afford it.
The chart that we have up that we have seen before
essentially shows part of this. We have virtually 99 percent of
Americans who, in some way or another as a result of this
landmark health law, are going to have health insurance; and
that small little sliver of white that you can barely see are
those Americans, 1 percent of so of Americans, who may choose
not to have health insurance, even though they can afford it.
So, essentially, that 1 percent sliver would be saying to the
99 percent of Americans who will have health insurance you are
going have to help pay for some of the costs of my health care,
even though I can afford it.
We are not talking about folks who need charity. We are not
talking about folks who really have no way to access health
care. We are talking about folks who have chosen not to have
health insurance coverage even though they can afford it, that
1 percent; and, as a result, they can impose costs on us.
When I mentioned $1,000, that wasn't just a number I pulled
out of a hat. Most American families that have health insurance
coverage pay, on average, about $1,000 in their health care
insurance premiums to pay for the cost not of their health care
or their family's health care but the health care for someone
else who doesn't have health insurance. So it is a matter of
trying to ensure that we don't have free riders who are
charging us for their care because they chose not to be
responsible.
Let me ask you all a question. Would you agree with this
quote by then Governor Romney: No more free riding, if you
will, where an individual says, I am not going to pay, even
though I can afford it. I am not going to get insurance, even
though I can afford it. I am instead going to show up and make
the taxpayers pay for me. It's the ultimate conservative idea,
which is that people have the responsibility for their own
care, and they don't look to government to take care of them if
they can afford to take care of themselves.
Does anyone disagree with what Governor Romney said?
Disagree.
Ms. SEVERINO. I would like to disagree with the fact that
the government is forcing----
Mr. BECERRA. Well, let me ask because my time is expired.
If you could just tell me if you disagree with what Governor
Romney has said. Anyone?
Mr. HERGER [presiding]. The witness may respond by written
letter.
Mr. BECERRA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. HERGER. The gentleman, Mr. Smith, is recognized.
Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our
witnesses for the civilized discussion that we have had today.
I think it is helpful. I certainly appreciate the insight that
each of you bring to the Committee.
Mr. Dellinger, can you conceive of any taxing power that
now that we know that it is a taxing power, that would not be
within the constraints of the Constitution?
Mr. DELLINGER. Yes, they are legion.
First of all, they are all of those who would run afoul of
any other provision of the Constitution, obviously, affecting
people's religion or speech rights or rights of intimate
association. Those kind of taxes would be--exercising the
taxing power would be invalid.
And the Court said, in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts,
it reminded us, as Justice Holmes said, the power to tax is not
the power to destroy as long as this Court sits. So if you had
a tax that actually forced people into an activity, it didn't
really give them a choice or stigmatized them as being
criminal, the Court stands ready to invalidate a tax that
exceeds that limit. But to give this Congress pretty wide range
to do things that are actually silly and stupid if you want to
enact them, the Court is not going to save you from all of
those.
Mr. SMITH. So if someone was compelled to purchase health
insurance against their own religious convictions, would they
be exempt?
Mr. DELLINGER. Yes. I think the Court would find that to be
unconstitutional. In fact, the Court suggests that if anyone
were compelled to purchase insurers it might be invalid. That
if the tax were so high that it became punitive, like the tax
in the child labor tax case was 10 percent of your total income
if you hired an underage person for 1 day, that they said was
actually a prohibition and coercion. This actually gives people
a choice to pay an amount that is not unreasonable in light
of--in fact, it is said to be too reasonable, by Mr. Bradbury
and others, for it to be effective.
Mr. SMITH. So there is the concern that employers may just
wish to pay the penalty for not providing insurance for their
employees, is that accurate?
Mr. DELLINGER. Correct.
A very good point that Mr. Bradbury made is that if the tax
penalty, financial incentive, whatever you want to call it, if
it remains as low as it is now, won't people make the rational
choice and say I am just not going to have insurance?
I just do want to note that under Governor Romney's plan in
Massachusetts no one's tax penalty could exceed 50 percent of
the cost of what they call a credible insurance premium for
credible coverage. So even though it was rational to pay half
of what you would have to pay, in fact, it worked; and people
found that to be incentive enough to buy insurance, that we did
have widespread coverage.
Mr. SMITH. Now in terms of uninsured now having insurance--
but one point of clarification. You mentioned that there are
100 million people that will see benefits from no lifetime cap?
Mr. DELLINGER. I think that is right. That is the figure I
have seen, Mr. Smith. I wish that I could give you----
Mr. SMITH. Is there 100 million people currently up against
their cap?
Mr. DELLINGER. No, I said that we will never have to worry
about a lifetime cap being imposed.
It may be virtually everyone. I saw the figure of 100
million. I don't know why it is not 300 million. The fact is
everybody now is guaranteed insurance no matter what kind of
disease you may have that has really chronic, long-term, high
costs. You will never have your insurance company announce we
have now put a lifetime cap on what you may have in terms of
payments.
Mr. SMITH. Now if someone is left without insurance,
perhaps because their employer opted out of the mandate, so to
speak, and just paid the penalty, do we know if that person
would be more likely to pursue private health insurance or go
on Medicaid?
Mr. DELLINGER. I don't know the answer to that. I do know
that there are substantial additional subsidies for people now
who are employed or working but can't afford private health
insurance. There are now substantial new subsidies as well as
the expansion of Medicaid in those States that accept it.
Mr. SMITH. But can we expect the Medicaid rolls to
increase?
Mr. DELLINGER. We certainly hope so. We hope that more
people who are not now covered will be covered.
Mr. SMITH. But we will expect the Medicaid rolls to expand?
Mr. DELLINGER. I think that is right. The whole point of
the legislation was to increase Medicaid eligibility to people
who are employed but whose income still makes it difficult for
them to purchase health insurance.
Mr. SMITH. And how does the reimbursement of Medicaid
compare to private insurance reimbursement?
Chairman CAMP [presiding]. And if you could answer quickly,
because time----
Mr. DELLINGER. I can't, because I don't know.
Chairman CAMP. Thank you.
Ms. Jenkins is recognized.
Ms. JENKINS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman; and thank you all for
being here today.
Mr. Bradbury, the Democrats have said the individual
mandate is needed to stop cost shifting and making people pay
for their own health care. Now Amicus Review participated and
states, ``The problem with this story is that it is untrue.''
Could you just explain why the cost shifting argument doesn't
paint an accurate picture of the purpose of the individual
mandate?
Mr. BRADBURY. I would be happy to.
Congress in its findings supporting the law explained why
the mandate was necessary, and two points come out clearly.
One, because of guaranteed issue and community rating, the cost
of insurance is going to go up; and we need to bring into the
market more of the healthier, younger people whose health care
costs, medical costs are going to be a lot less than the cost
of insurance. So that the amount they pay in to the system is
greater than the amount they take out, in order to lower the
average cost for everybody across the system, to try to control
what would otherwise be runaway cost increases for insurance
premiums.
Number two, the guaranteed issue and community rating
provisions were going to cause people, Congress recognized very
clearly--and this was the experience of some States--to drop
the insurance or defer getting insurance because they know they
would be guaranteed insurance if they get sick and they will
wait. That is a rational decision. And so you actually have
lower numbers of people insured in the country, not higher
numbers. So it was necessary to mandate that everybody go into
the market and buy insurance in order to counteract that what I
call moral hazard.
I think, as Justice Alito pointed out at oral argument, the
average cost of insurance policy in 2016 is expected to be
$5,600, an individual insurance policy. And the average cost in
health care that a young, healthy American incurs per year is
about $850. And so it is very clear that the purpose of the
mandate was to require more people to pay the greater amount
into the system than they would be taking out.
And I just want to point out that the $1,000 figure that is
often bandied about is not--I don't really think there is good
substance behind that figure. This is the assumption or
assertion that the average cost of insurance is $1,000 higher
for the typical American family because of cost shifting from
uninsured.
As I understand it, the way that number was derived I think
is not terribly reliable. I think it is taking the $43 billion
that has been estimated in uncompensated health care generally
in the country and assuming that every dollar--dollar for
dollar of that $43 billion flows through to the bottom line of
insurance costs for everybody else. And they simply divide that
number into the total amount of insurance premiums people pay
and come up with $1,000 and say, oh, it must account for $1,000
of each average policy's cost.
But it is really not a well-taken assumption. Because a lot
of people who choose to go without insurance the statistics
show actually pay for the health care they incur and that a lot
of that uncompensated care is provided to lower income folks
and actually gets absorbed by hospitals and other health care
providers and not passed along to insurance companies. There
are a lot of reasons for that, but it is not a safe assumption
that, dollar for dollar, uncompensated care gets passed along
to the insurance--bottom line insurance premium of others.
Ms. JENKINS. Okay, that is helpful.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Chairman CAMP. Thank you.
Last, but not least, Mr. Reed.
Mr. REED. I always appreciate going last, because all the
good questions are gone.
Just some commentary. I have been listening to this
argument before I had to leave and then come back and the
taxing versus the penalty--and from my perspective as a new
Member of Congress, freshman Member of Congress, it is time to
be honest with the American people.
And what this was is the Supreme Court release came back
and said, you know, we have an expansion of government to deal
with the health care situation. We are going to raise taxes
under Congress' act to pay for it.
If that is what the people want, and when I read the Chief
Justice's decision--I read it five times--essentially saying,
if that is what the people want, so be it, and it is up to the
people to decide where we go.
That being said, I am concerned where we are going to go in
the future with the congressional power that has been granted
to us now under the taxing power of the Supreme Court decision
as I interpret it and as I read it. One of the things that is
being kicked around is a lot of people think the political
pressure of tax increases will be enough check on the system.
Do you all agree with that? Does anyone disagree with that?
Mr. CASEY. I do not think that the political pressures will
be sufficient.
Mr. REED. So that being the case--and that is exactly where
I wanted to go, Mr. Casey--is what would be a mechanism that we
can do in Congress in your opinion to restrain or to delineate
where that power now lies?
Mr. CASEY. I think one thing you can do--and it is not
clear entirely what the Supreme Court might do, but one thing
you can do is make very clear when you are raising a tax and
when you are not exercising your authority to raise and collect
taxes. That is, after all, your decision. The Court, while some
of its language might suggest, I do not believe the Supreme
Court would hold that Congress can't chose which of its
enumerated powers to exercise, and you could do that.
Mr. REED. See, and I appreciate that comment, because I
have been wrestling with this. Because there are some proposals
that are now floating out that we should adopt statutory
language that say clearly in our legislation going forward what
power we rely on. Is it a tax or is it a penalty? And I couple
that with my reading of the decision where they took the anti-
injunction statute and they said, essentially for purposes of
statutory compliance, we are going to say whatever Congress
says it is, that is what we are going to interpret it to be for
statutory tax. But for constitutionality we are going to go
beyond that, and we are going to say whatever constitutional
power is out there, and we are going to hold it on that.
And that concerns me. Because if we have that requirement--
a statutory requirement to put in for statutory purposes we are
going declare the power that we are exercising, could not
Congress in that theoretical situation say for statutory
purposes we are exercising this power? That would then comply
with the statute, but for constitutionality purposes the Court
could go wherever it wants to go. And that is the concern.
Do you see the concern? Is my logic working?
Mr. CASEY. Sure, your logic is perfect. Because, of course,
in many ways it is impossible to draft a statute that is judge
proof.
But what you can do is make it so clear that we are not in
this instance exercising our power to tax, or in another
instance we are, that the Court will not be able to pretend
that it is somehow interpreting the law you actually passed and
transform it into a tax when it wasn't.
Mr. REED. I appreciate that.
Does Mr. Bradbury or any other----
Mr. DELLINGER. Well, in terms of the Tax Injunction Act it
is quite simple for Congress to say that the provisions of this
Act shall not apply--or the Anti-Injunction Act shall not apply
to this particular provision of law and then can proceed.
I think one of the reasons why I thought the Tax Injunction
Act argument was quite good, that this is a bar to this
litigation--I think one of the reasons the Court may have
leaned a little against that is that I think if they had held
that this lawsuit was barred as a pre-enforcement lawsuit by
the Tax Injunction Act that Chairman Camp and his colleague,
the Ranking Member and their colleagues would have immediately
passed a one-sentence law saying the provisions of the Anti-
Injunction Act shall not apply to challenges on the Affordable
Care Act, and the Court would have heard this again in October.
And I don't think anybody could have voted against that,
Mr. Chairman. They would have said, yes, we don't want our law
to block this. One sentence will remove that barrier.
I think that is really what would have happened.
Mr. REED. Interesting dynamics.
I go back to the point I am going to be honest with the
American People. When we stand for legislation here, if we are
going to expand government and raise taxes to pay for it, then
that is what it is. Let the people decide. And hopefully we can
move forward to that debate in November.
With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman. I thank the panel
for your participation.
Chairman CAMP. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Reed.
I also want to thank the entire panel for a very long
morning and for all of your testimony. It was very helpful.
And, with that, this hearing is hereby adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 1:17 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
