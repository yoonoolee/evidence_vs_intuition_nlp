THURSDAY, MAY 12, 2011

House of Representatives,
Committee on Small Business,
Subcommittee on Oversight,
Investigations and Regulations,
Washington, DC.
The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10 a.m., in room
2360, Rayburn House Office Building. Hon. Mike Coffman
(chairman of the Subcommittee) presiding.
Present: Representatives Coffman, West, Landry, Altmire.
Chairman Coffman. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for
joining us. The hearing will now come to order.
I thank all of you for joining us today for this hearing on
EPA regulations and whether they are harming the ability of
small businesses to compete, particularly in today's difficult
economic climate.
I would like to extend special thanks to our witnesses for
making the trip to the Capitol and taking time out of their
schedules to discuss this issue with us here today.
Our Subcommittee will hear directly from small business
owners about how existing and proposed EPA regulations are
affecting their industry and hindering their ability to remain
profitable and grow their businesses. According to a 2010
report by the Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy at the Small
Business Administration, small businesses bear a significantly
greater burden as a result of federal regulations than larger
businesses. This report indicates that federal regulatory costs
to small businesses per employee are $10,585, an amount that is
36 percent higher than the cost borne by larger employers.
Under the leadership of Administrator Lisa Jackson, the EPA
is in the process of developing and finalizing some 30
regulations and instituting new policy rules. The EPA has
adopted a rigorous environmental agenda that gives little
consideration to the impact on businesses in general and small
businesses in particular. The actions of the EPA under
Administrator Jackson are especially troubling due to their
disregard for the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which seeks to
reduce the undue burden of federal regulations on small
businesses by requiring analysis of compliance costs and
consideration of less onerous alternatives.
Not only has EPA overlooked Federal law, but it has
indicated a willingness to sidestep the president's wishes as
well. This has been made especially evident in testimony
received from Assistant Administrator Mathy Stanislaus at a
House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing on April 14th
when he indicated that the EPA did not take into account job
losses as the result of their rulemaking. This directly
contradicts Executive Order 13563, which orders all federal
entities to ``impose the least burden on society,'' taking into
account ``the cost of cumulative regulations'' as well as
requiring that agencies should ``analyze any rules that are
excessively burdensome,'' speaking directly about small
businesses which have accounted for about 70 percent of all new
jobs in the United States. The EPA has also disregarded a
January 18th presidential memorandum that solidifies the
commitment of the Executive Branch to promote the importance of
the Regulatory Flexibility Act to protect small businesses from
onerous regulations.
We owe it to our constituents to critically analyze the
need for these regulations and the impact they will have on
businesses in our districts, states, and country overall. It is
paramount that regulations or rules that purport to protect the
environment are balanced and do not turn a blind eye to the
economic concerns of our nation's small businesses. These
businesses are the engine that drives our economy, without
which no true recovery will be possible.
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on the real
world effect of these EPA regulations and the implications for
business growth and job creation.
I now recognize Ranking Member Altmire for his opening
statement.
Mr. Altmire. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The mission of the Environmental Protection Agency is
undisputed--protecting the public health and our natural
resources. Every community in every congressional district
depends on clear air and drinking water for their well-being
and quality of life. Protecting natural resources and the
health of every citizen through conservation and sensible
regulation makes good business sense as a clean environment
leads to a thriving community. However, in pursuing these
goals, the federal government must do so carefully, making sure
that we balance the benefits with the costs of the
environmental regulations. Unfortunately, it has been small
businesses which create two-thirds of all new jobs which have
been most negatively impacted by EPA's recent rules.
For small businesses, the cost of complying with EPA
regulations is substantial. For firms with fewer than 20
employees, they spend more than $4,000 per employee annually,
which is double the amount spent by larger companies, to comply
with federal regulations. As a result, some entrepreneurs are
spending more on regulatory requirements than they are on
expanding their businesses.
In order to limit this burden, Congress enacted the
Regulatory Flexibility Act in 1980 and the Small Business
Regulatory Enforcement Act of 1986. Together these laws require
the EPA to take into account the impact its regulations will
have on small businesses. In some cases they have been
successful at reducing compliance costs for small businesses,
particularly with rules related to stormwater discharge from
construction sites and emissions from diesel engines.
Unfortunately, such positive outcomes have been the
exception rather than the rule. In too many instances, the EPA
has not used the tools it has had at its disposal to write
sensible rules that take into account the unique nature of
small businesses. When promulgating its series of landmark
greenhouse gas rules, the Agency failed to convene a small
business advocacy review panel, excluding small firms from
being heard on the wide-ranging rule.
The EPA rationalized its disregard for the panel by
limiting the rules research reach on small business through a
tailoring rule that lessened the impact of the greenhouse gas
regulations on smaller firms. Despite the EPA's efforts, the
SBA's Office of Advocacy estimates that 1,200 businesses would
still be subject to the new regulations. This effect and the
overall cost on small firms could become even more significant
when the tailoring rule expires. Instead of neglecting small
businesses' concerns, the EPA should have conducted meaningful
outreach. More has to be done to ensure the Agency does not
simply excuse itself from its obligations under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, particularly the review panel process. By
strengthening these protections, we can strike an appropriate
balance between regulations that protect the well-being of our
communities but also limit costs they impose on small
businesses.
During today's hearing we will be able to hear from small
businesses and learn about their experiences with the EPA,
ensuring that the concerns of small firms are heard is
critical, and it is my hope, Mr. Chairman, that the EPA will
follow our lead and increase its outreach to these job
creators. In my home state of Pennsylvania, small businesses
account for more than 98 percent of employer firms. They remain
the backbone of the U.S. economy and are absolutely critical to
job creation. It is essential that the federal government
carefully balance the costs and benefits of environmental
regulations so that these businesses are not harmed and our
nation's economic progress is not slowed.
I want to thank all of our witnesses in advance for taking
the time to travel here, giving up your time to be here. And I
look forward to hearing your testimony. I yield back my time.
Chairman Coffman. Thank you, Ranking Member Altmire.
If Committee members have an opening statement prepared, I
ask that they be submitted for the record.
I would like to take a moment to explain the timing lights
for those testifying today. You will each have five minutes to
deliver your testimony. The light will start out as green. When
you have one minute remaining, the light will turn yellow. And
finally, it will turn red at the end of your five minutes. And
I will ask that you try to keep to the time limit but I will be
a little lenient as you finish.

STATEMENTS OF JOHN WARD, CHAIRMAN, CITIZENS FOR RECYCLING
FIRST, BROOMFIELD, CO; GLENN JOHNSTON, VICE PRESIDENT OF
REGULATORY AFFAIRS, GEVO INC., ENGLEWOOD, CO; BRADFORD MULLER,
VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING AND CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS,
CHARLOTTE PIPE AND FOUNDRY COMPANY, CHARLOTTE, NC

Chairman Coffman. It is my pleasure to introduce our first
witness and my constituent, Glenn Johnston.
Mr. Johnston is the Vice President of Regulatory Affairs at
Gevo, Incorporated. Gevo is in the process of developing
renewable alternatives to petroleum-based products that can be
used in cars, airplanes, and even in synthetic rubber and
plastics. We appreciate your testimony, Mr. Johnston.

STATEMENT OF GLENN JOHNSTON

Mr. Johnston. Chairman Coffman, members of the Committee. I
am honored to be with you this morning and discuss the great
potential for isobutanol as an alternative transportation fuel
in America and the current challenges we have with U.S. EPA
regulations.
Gevo is a leading renewable chemicals and advanced biofuels
company. We are developing bio-based alternatives to petroleum-
based products using a combination of synthetic biology and
chemistry. We plan to produce isobutanol, a versatile chemical
platform for liquid fuels and the petrochemical markets.
Isobutanol has a broad market application as a solvent and
a gasoline blend stock and can help refiners meet their
renewable fuel and cleaner obligations. It can also be further
processed using well known chemical processes used today into
jet fuel and feed stocks for the production of synthetic
rubber, plastics, and polyesters. Gevo's technology is designed
to retrofit existing ethanol plants and we are currently in the
process of retrofitting an ethanol plant in southern Minnesota,
which will come on line in the first half of 2012.
Isobutanol is an important platform chemical with broad
applications in large chemicals and fuel markets. As a drop-in
product, isobutanol should allow customers to replace
petroleum-derived raw materials with isobutanol-derived raw
materials without modification to their equipment or production
processes. Since isobutanol can be dropped into existing
infrastructure, it provides for an easy integration into
existing refining and petrochemical production processes. This
type of technology is business born in America and is creating
new jobs today to build the next generation of biofuels and
make contributions towards reducing our dependence on foreign
oil.
We support the manner in which EPA has allowed the
renewable fuel standard and advanced fuel mandates to continue
despite shortfalls in some categories under the statute. This
will help drive more gallons in the short term using
technologies such as Gevo that is economically competitive with
current oil prices. However, legacy EPA policies are creating
supply chain challenges with second generation biofuels such as
ourselves. Gevo and the advanced biofuels industry in general
believe that EPA should review its regulatory regime and to the
extent possible, should assure that biofuels other than ethanol
have equal and unfettered market access.
The EPA's one-pound waiver rule implementation is a
regulatory obstacle to the development of second generation
advanced biofuels. There is a relatively straightforward change
that can be made to EPA's testing regime that would eliminate
this hurdle. Under the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR, gasoline
containing between 9 and 10 percent ethanol may exceed the
revapor pressure, the RVP limit, for straight-line gasoline by
one pound per square inch. EPA currently tests the RVP of
gasoline by obtaining samples at retail outlets.
Under current testing procedures, EPA protocol does not
account for the presence of alcohol additives other than
ethanol. Thus, if E10 is mixed with gasoline containing
isobutanol or another drop-in fuel, the resulting mixture would
be found noncompliant because ethanol would be diluted below
the 9 to 10 percent ratio required under the Clean Air Act for
the RVP waiver.
Due to the fact that testing occurs in the field, there
currently is no way to determine the E10 prior to mixing with
another alcohol-blended fuel. We would have to meet the RVP
limit. A direct linear relationship exists between ethanol and
isobutanol and RVP, allowing the extrapolation of the ethanol
content of the fuel before it was mixed and thus determining
its compliance. Through guidance or a simple revision in EPA
regulations, EPA could require ASTM tests used to determine the
ethanol content of a fuel to also determine the amount of
isobutanol and other alcohols. In the event that isobutanol
and/or other alcohols were present, the revised regulation or
guidance with direct laboratory to extrapolate the RVP of the
fuel or that the fuel had not been mixed with isobutanol in the
first place. Revising the test regulations provides for a
noncontroversial, easily implemented solution to a major
barrier.
In conclusion, significant amounts of progress have been
made over the last three years by Gevo with isobutanol and its
potential in the advanced biofuels sector. Isobutanol can make
a significant contribution towards diversifying America's world
transportation fuels.
Thank you for the opportunity to be with you today and I
look forward to your questions.

Chairman Coffman. Thank you, Mr. Johnston.
Our next witness is Mr. John Ward, chairman of Citizens for
Recycling First. Mr. Ward has vast experience in issues
affecting the coal industry, previously serving as President of
the American Coal Council and was a member of the National Coal
Council. Today he will be speaking about EPA regulations
affecting coal ash recycling. We look forward to hearing your
testimony, Mr. Ward.

STATEMENT OF JOHN WARD

Mr. Ward. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the
Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this
issue today.
Citizens for Recycling First is comprised of about 1,500
individuals, most of whom are small businesses, and they are
specifically interested in preserving and enhancing recycling
opportunities for coal ash.
In the decade from 1999 to 2009, our nation successfully
recycled 519 million tons of coal ash, about 38 percent of the
coal ash that was produced in generating electricity. The
businesses responsible for achieving this remarkable
environmental success story are overwhelmingly small
businesses. The utilities are not the recyclers. There is a
network of small businesses who provide marketing services.
There are companies who provide innovative technologies for
using the coal ash. And the users themselves are overwhelmingly
small businesses. For instance, 85 percent of the ready mix
concrete producers in the United States have revenues under $30
million.
I appreciate the Committee's topic, Green Isn't Always
Gold. In the case of EPA's current coal ash regulatory process,
the Agency's actions are not only not gold; they are not even
very green. In the Agency's single-minded quest to gain more
enforcement authority over the disposal of coal ash, EPA
appears resolved to ignore the negative impacts of its actions
on an entire recycling industry and the small businesses that
comprise it. If EPA succeeds in getting the regulations it
wants, our nation will end up putting hundreds of millions of
tons more material into landfills rather than safely recycling
it. And that is hardly a green result.
Furthermore, EPA appears content to create regulatory
uncertainty that is already harming the recycling industry,
even though formal regulations have not been finalized.
A year ago EPA proposed labeling coal ash as hazardous
waste when it is disposed. When that idea was confronted by a
wall of opposition from other government agencies,
academicians, recyclers, coal ash users and more, EPA responded
by simply slowing the process down. EPA officials have recently
been quoted as saying it may be 2013 before the Agency gets
around to proposing a final rule. In the meantime, the coal ash
recycling industry is twisting in the wind with the unresolved
question will coal ash be a hazardous waste or not?
Now, a couple of things about coal ash. First of all, it
does not qualify as a hazardous waste based on its toxicity.
That is not an opinion; that is a scientific fact. The level of
metals that are in coal ash are similar to the levels of metals
in the materials that it replaces when it is recycled.
Secondly, EPA's proposals for regulating coal ash disposal
basically boil down to a regulatory turf grab. The EPA has
proposed both a hazardous and nonhazardous regulatory approach.
The landfill standards that they are proposing under both
approaches are essentially the same. You do not get a better
landfill by designating the material hazardous waste.
So why are they doing it? Because by designating it
hazardous waste they are able to take enforcement authority
away from the states and take it for themselves. Now, we have
talked to EPA and told them the devastating effects this has on
recycling. And even in advance of the rule being finished, we
are already seeing users of coal ash taking it out of their
specifications because they are worried about potential legal
liability or the health issues if it is really hazardous. We
are seeing manufacturers of products that compete with recycled
coal ash run ads with skulls and crossbones, talking about how
coal ash may be a hazardous waste if EPA goes forward with
this. We are now beginning to see commercial liability
insurance policy exclusions for products that contain coal ash.
Now, all of these concerns have been conveyed to EPA over
the last two years in meetings and formal written testimony; in
all eight of the EPA's public hearings that were conducted last
year. EPA's response has been twofold. Number one, they have
refused to evaluate the impacts on small businesses in the
recycling sector. Their excuse is we are only regulating
utilities. You people are an indirect effect; we do not have to
look at it. Their second response has been a hazardous waste
designation will actually be good for you. People are going to
want to use more coal ash if it is designated a hazardous
waste. I see you raising your eyebrows. It is a nonsensical
proposition. My written testimony spells out exactly why it is.
But the bottom line is, this is not about coal ash. This is
about coal. And EPA is waging a war on coal and coal ash is
another way for them to get at it.
We need Congress's help. Representative David McKinley has
introduced a bill, H.R. 1391, which would prohibit EPA from
regulating coal ash as a hazardous waste. It would not prohibit
EPA from moving forward with improving landfill disposal
standards. Remember, the landfill disposal standards under
their nonhazardous approach are the same. But it would remove
this regulatory uncertainty that is hanging over the heads of
coal ash recyclers today and is already harming a tremendously
environmentally beneficial business in our nation.
Thank you very much for the opportunity to testify.

Chairman Coffman. Thank you, Mr. Ward.
I would like now to introduce Mr. Bradford Muller, Vice
President of Marketing for Charlotte Pipe and Foundry Company,
a 110-year-old family-owned business located in Charlotte,
North Carolina. The Subcommittee appreciates you taking the
time to speak to us today, Mr. Muller.

STATEMENT OF BRADFORD MULLER

Mr. Muller. Thank you, Chairman Coffman, Ranking Member
Altmire, and members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the
opportunity to testify before you today on the question of
whether EPA regulations are harming small business, in
particular the metal casting industry. And the answer is
unequivocally, yes.
Charlotte Pipe and Foundry is a family-owned, fourth
generation company. We have been manufacturing cast iron pipe
and fittings for plumbing systems for 110 years. Charlotte Pipe
is one of only three U.S. foundries left that make these
products with dozens of competing foundries having closed their
doors over the last two decades.
Charlotte Pipe and the entire metal casting industry has
been hard hit by this recession. The manufacturing sector has
lost 2.2 million jobs since the recession began and more than
150 metal casters have closed their doors, forcing thousands to
lose their jobs. In our case, commercial construction, the
primary market for our products, was down 64 percent from its
peak in 2006 before rebounding slightly this year. Despite such
a massive loss of volume, we have not laid off any of our 450
associates, sacrificing our profitability to give our people as
many hours as possible while keeping their benefits and health
insurance intact. In fact, we have not had a layoff in our cast
iron division since the early 1950s when we mechanized the
plant, despite several significant recessions since that time.
I also serve as a member of the American Foundry Society,
and I am pleased to testify on their behalf today.
Headquartered in Schaumberg, Illinois, AFS is the major trade
association for the North American metal casting industry,
which comprises more than 2,000 casting facilities, many of
which are in your districts.
The metal casting industry is critical to the U.S. economy.
More than 90 percent of all manufactured goods use metal
castings as engineered components. The U.S. Military depends on
metal castings for jet fighters, ships, tanks, trucks, and
weapon systems. Without castings, we would not be able to draw
oil, propel aircraft or space vehicles, or economically plant
and harvest crops that feed the world's population.
Metal casting is the sixth largest industry in America,
shipping products valued at $20 billion and directly employing
200,000 people. Over 80 percent of U.S. metal casters employ
100 workers or less and these are green jobs. Foundries recycle
millions of tons of scrap metal as a raw material each year.
Unfortunately, some of the most economically threatening
regulatory proposals to our industry are coming from EPA.
Appropriate regulations that improve health, safety, and the
environment are a necessary part of doing business. However,
when the regulatory process can advance 29 major rules and 173
others with little or no regard to the cost or their
implications, the system is broken. I could regale you with
countless examples but I will bring your attention to one
situation that has directly cost North Carolina hundreds of
jobs.
A few years ago, Charlotte Pipe bought land in rural North
Carolina with the hopes of building a new state-of-the-art
foundry. Not only would the new facility allow us to operate
more efficiently, it would remove a large stationary source of
emissions from downtown Charlotte. After we drew up plans for
the new facility, we submitted our air permit. A year and a
half later the permit sat unapproved. Our state regulators
eventually told us that while the previous air dispersion
models only had to account for filterable particulate, new air
permits now require condensables to be included in the total
particulate matter 2.5 models. The state also came back to us
and said since we would be relocating our plant to a poorer
area, in the name of environmental justice we would have to
look at how any additional pollution would impact the local
community. They never asked us how creating hundreds of new
construction jobs and ancillary small business jobs would have
impacted the local community.
Finally, the PM 2.5 standards are under review by EPA.
Limits are currently set at 15 parts per billion. The new
levels being considered are between 12 and 14 parts per
billion. The naturally occurring levels on the land we bought
in North Carolina is 12.8 parts per billion, higher than the
low end of the range that EPA is proposing. Knowing the
standards which were changed and changing in midstream, knowing
we would not be able to meet these, we pulled our permit and
suspended the project, killing all those construction jobs.
Based on our recent experience, I can only conclude that
our current government looks at manufacturers not as partners
that would alleviate unemployment and generate tax revenues but
as targets to regulate and intimidate to justify the ever-
expanding reach of the federal bureaucracy.
Thank you for the opportunity to appear today and I welcome
your questions.

Chairman Coffman. Thank you, Mr. Muller. Let me ask a few
questions of the panel and then I will defer to the ranking
member and then to the other members present.
My first question, and it is to all the members of the
panel, how difficult is it for your businesses to deal with the
regulatory uncertainty posed by the EPA. Mr. Johnston, if we
can start with you.
Mr. Johnston. Regulatory certainly would allow us to gain
more funding through the public sector for projects as we go
forward. And anytime you introduce regulatory certainty it is
the number one and has been reviewed by investment firms as the
number one risk that advanced biofuel corporations face today--
is that regulatory uncertainty. It would be very helpful to
maintain that thorugh the RFS and vehicles like that through
the future so that things can develop and that we do not have
to run into the high interest rates and the risk comes down for
our investments.
Chairman Coffman. Mr. Ward.
Mr. Ward. As the coal ash recycling industry, we thought we
had regulatory certainty at one point. EPA in two previous
reports to Congress and two previous regulatory determinations,
one in 1993 and a 2000 final regulatory determination,
concluded that coal ash did not warrant regulation as a
hazardous waste. When that happened in 2000 and we got
regulatory certainty with a final regulatory determination, the
recycling rate for coal ash in this country increased from 30
percent in 2000 to 44 percent in 2008. That is almost a 50
percent increase in less than a decade by having that
regulatory uncertainty. Today's EPA is talking about
withdrawing their final regulatory determination and all of
that benefit is gone.
So I will answer the question that way. Regulatory
certainty helped our business enormously but that is now all
being taken away by reinjecting uncertainty.
Chairman Coffman. Mr. Muller.
Mr. Muller. Similar response. Regulatory certainty would
allow us to determine whether we can build this new plant in
North Carolina or not. It would be a much more energy efficient
plant, state-of-the-art, straight-line foundry and it would
remove a large source of emissions from downtown Charlotte. Not
only do we have the particulate matter 2.5 issue, the National
Ambient Air Quality standards are under review, ozone. And
certainly, cap-and-trade or greenhouse gas regulation from EPA
would most likely kill that foundry project as well.
So these regulations that are hanging over our head are
holding this project up and frankly we are not sure it would
ever get permitted in the first place.
Chairman Coffman. Mr. Johnston, in your opinion, what EPA
regulatory changes could be made to allow for biofuels such as
isobutanol to have equal access to the market?
Mr. Johnston. We have spoken to the EPA about this and it
is a very simple either guidance or an internal policy change
that they need to make that would allow isobutanol to be mixed
in a service station underground storage tank with E10. It is a
very straightforward change that we feel if they move forward
on right now would really assist us in the future.
Chairman Coffman. Are there any differences environmentally
in terms of emissions?
Mr. Johnston. No. Our emissions, we have had testing done,
a part of the EPA standards and submitted it to them. And our
emissions from a burning of our fuel does not create any
greenhouse gas issues.
Chairman Coffman. Okay. Mr. Ward, our Subcommittee is
especially concerned with the impacts of regulations on small
businesses. Can you give me a couple of examples where EPA's
proposed coal ash rule has created unwarranted challenges for
small businesses or stifled their innovation?
Mr. Ward. We have numerous examples and I am happy to share
as many as we like with the Committee. For the purposes of a
brief answer I will give you a big one and a small one. A big
one, there are a number of small businesses who are developing
innovative processes for improving the quality of coal ash so
that it can be used in more recycling applications. For
instance, in concrete which improves the durability of the
concrete, makes our roads and bridges last longer. Those
technologies are essentially dead in the water right now
because nobody wants to invest 20 or 30 million dollars in a
technology facility to clean up a source of ash that they do
not know if they are going to be able to sell it after EPA
declares it a hazardous waste. So there is an example of a
larger industry that is already dead.
Let me give you one that may sound humorous as a small one,
but coal ash gets recycled in a lot of different areas. I know
a producer down in the south who is looking at using coal ash
to make clay pigeons for a shooting range. When this EPA thing
started they stopped the project entirely. Now, this is a
business that is spraying lead all over the field but they were
afraid of having coal ash in the clay pigeons that were going
to get shot as they were flying out in the field.
It runs the gamut. We have literally dozens of examples
like this going on right now.
Chairman Coffman. Okay. Thank you.
Mr. Muller, should EPA continue to place stricter
environmental standards on businesses in the future, do you
believe that small businesses such as Charlotte Pipe will be
able to maintain or increase current staffing levels?
Mr. Muller. No, I do not. You know, we have not contributed
to the unemployment problem but we are also not in a position
to help solve the unemployment problem by hiring new
associates. So the continued hanging over our heads of
greenhouse in particular, even the boiler MACT which we have
not discussed, while it does not directly affect Charlotte Pipe
and Foundry, anything that hurts a utility is going to drive up
our energy costs. And we are a very energy-intensive industry,
the foundry industry. So this constant uncertainty and constant
attack that we feel that manufacturers are under in America
will not help us solve the employment problem.
Chairman Coffman. Okay. Thank you. At this time I would
like to defer to Ranking Member Altmire.
Mr. Altmire. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Johnston, in
promulgating its greenhouse gas rules, the EPA chose not to
convene a small business advocacy review panel but it attempted
to provide relief through the tailoring rule. The EPA instead,
if it had held small business advocacy panels, do you believe
the rules' impact on small firms could have been mitigated more
appropriately or it would have made a positive difference?
Mr. Johnston. I think so. With the tailoring rule, the
greenhouse gas, I mean, we are in the midst of permitting a
plant in southern Minnesota. And part of that permitting
process was looking at what the effect of the new regulations
were going to cost us to comply with. And when the tailoring
rule came out and also the exemption of biogenic carbon from
some of the greenhouse gas, it allowed us to look at the plant
as an economic alternative. If they had kept it where it was
and they had gotten that feedback earlier in the process it
would have much more streamlined the regulation and given
regulatory certainty to projects like ours.
Mr. Altmire. Okay. Mr. Muller, do you have a comment on
that?
Mr. Muller. I am sorry, sir. Can you repeat what the
question is?
Mr. Altmire. Let me ask you something similar.
Mr. Muller. Okay.
Mr. Altmire. The EPA's greenhouse gas tailoring rule
exempts smaller businesses from most of the requirements of the
rule. Does this exemption ensure that small businesses like
yours will not be affected by the rule?
Mr. Muller. No, for the same reason that I gave the
Chairman, that anytime you impact the utilities and the coal
industry frankly. Coal is a major raw material for us, so
anything that impacts the coal industry and the utility
industry is going to drive our energy costs and our raw
material costs up. So to claim that they are only targeting
large sources of emissions does not hold water because everyone
will be affected by this. Even homeowners' rates will--utility
rates will increase.
Mr. Altmire. Mr. Ward, I wonder if you could discuss the
distinction between landfill for coal ash that you mentioned in
your testimony versus the regulation that we are talking about
today.
Mr. Ward. The regulation we are talking about today is a
direct outcome of an incident that occurred in December 2008
when a large disposal pond in Tennessee failed, operated by the
Tennessee Valley Authority. And EPA said we are going to
regulate coal ash disposal now. Over the debate, however, the
debate has shifted from regulating coal ash disposal methods to
demonizing coal ash itself. If we had spilled a billion gallons
of skim milk in the Clinch River, we would have had an
environmental disaster but we would have been talking about
improving standards for milk containment facilities, not about
the milk.
But now we have this parade of things about coal ash. What
EPA is saying, this is supposed to be a coal ash disposal
rulemaking in which they are improving standards for coal ash
landfills and ponds where coal ash is disposed. We agreed with
that. Those standards should be improved. But the way they are
going about it by designating it a hazardous waste so that they
can get more enforcement authority, they are creating a stigma
that is seriously damaging a recycling market.
And I saw your eyebrows all go up when I said, you know,
they think that a hazardous waste designation will make people
want to recycle more. I ask you. Would you want a material in
your home, your school, or your business that is called a
hazardous waste on the property of the person who made it but
is not when you put it in your home? That is the problem. EPA
will tell you they are not trying to regulate us, that the
beneficial use industry is exempt, but the way they are trying
to regulate disposal is killing us.
Mr. Altmire. So you do not have a problem with the landfill
regulations as they currently stand or the appropriateness of
having those regulations.
Mr. Ward. No.
Mr. Altmire. It is that designation.
Mr. Ward. The coal ash recycling industry, and by the way,
the utility industry as well, is on record supporting new and
better landfill and coal ash disposal regulations. Absolutely
that is an appropriate thing. We should never, ever have
another incident like the thing that happened at the TVA
facility in 2008. That has to be done away with. But we can do
it without creating an unjustified and unwarranted stigma on
coal ash that is threatening to undo one of the largest and
greatest recycling success stories in our nation's history.
Mr. Altmire. Great. Thank you. One more, Mr. Chairman, for
Mr. Muller.
In your testimony, you discuss new greenhouse gas
permitting requirements would cause bureaucratic gridlock
creating another hurdle a company seeking to expand or rebuild
would have to face. How do you see such administrative delays
affecting investment in new facilities?
Mr. Muller. Well, that is a great question. We, part of the
decision we have to make if we were able to build our new
foundry is whether to have a cupola melt or an electric melt.
And the implications of either are dependent on what the
greenhouse regulations are. Electric melt would be much more
efficient way to operate the foundry but with electricity rates
necessarily skyrocketing under such a regime then we would
probably have to revoke--continue to do copula melt which would
use coke and is far less efficient. So these are the types of
decisions that hang in the balance when we are waiting for the
final rules.
Mr. Altmire. What about the decision to locate a plant
operation overseas rather than domestic?
Mr. Muller. Well, we are committed to manufacturing in the
United States. Our management is fourth generation and they
would not relocate overseas but some of our competitors have
and a lot of our competitors have gone out of business. So it
is absolutely understandable that a foundry could be built over
in China and they can buy scrap metal here, ship it to China,
melt it, ship it back here, and still sell at 25 percent below
our market. So it is a very attractive alternative.
Mr. Altmire. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Coffman. Thank you, Mr. Altmire.
Mr. West.
Mr. West. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We have kind of run into some difficulties down in Florida
with the EPA and this thing called the numeric nutrient
criteria which is really affecting our farmers and also some of
our local municipalities as far as stormwater runoff. And one
of the things that they have been asking is, you know, how do
you determine the formulas for this numeric nutrient criteria
regulation that they are coming down with.
So when I was listening to you speak, Mr. Johnston, you
know, obviously, you know, from being down south I cannot
articulate all those highly technical things, but are there
certain formulas that, you know, that you are developing with
this conversion of the fuels or what have you that the EPA is
not consulting with you on or, you know, are they coming down
and showing you some type of calculation that they are using to
bring this regulatory environment on you?
Mr. Johnston. Mr. Congressman, interesting question. We
have--there is obviously through the regulatory schemes there
are many different formulas that work into our decision-making
regarding regulatory compliance as well as listing our
products. And a lot of them are based on historical data that
in today's regime does not always necessarily apply. And what
we would do with EPA is look at, for example, the isobutanol in
the underground storage tank. When these regulations were made
there really was only one biofuel. And calculations for our
biofuel is really straightforward. It is really a simple
calculation and EPA being able to take that and say, okay,
there is more biofuels, there is more progress in the United
States. I mean, small businesses are creating newer and newer
materials. Being able to do that and move that forward would
really help provide the American jobs and pull out foreign oil
that is needed so desperately.
Mr. West. Next question then, and this can be across the
board, you know, obviously, in a regulatory environment that is
on steroids there are increased costs to your businesses. So,
you know, how do you contend with these, you know, rising
costs? And we have not even talked about some of the other
things like health care.
Mr. Johnston. I will take the first shot at that, Mr.
Congressman. When we put together our budgets, we put together
a pretty big amount of money for the regulatory compliance. And
that money could be used elsewhere in the business to provide
more development, more jobs, where we are using that to simply
file paperwork and comply. And it gets to be a pretty big
percentage of any new project where you have to meet all these
government regulations and be able to file all the paperwork
required. Anything to streamline that and provide regulatory
certainty would provide benefit to the overall company and
reduce our costs.
Mr. Ward. For a number of the companies in the coal ash
recycling business, they are looking at not how to budget for
the costs but whether they are going to stay in business. If
coal ash is declared a hazardous waste when it is disposed and
that stigma causes people not to want to use it for recycling
applications, most of the businesses in our area, the folks who
actually market coal ash and technologies for improving it,
they are just going out of business.
The users, the small businesses that rely on this material
as a strategic building material--and they do--in many cases
coal ash actually improves the quality of the products it is
used in--they will just choose not to use it and they will go
to other materials that have higher embodied energies and lower
performance but they will just switch to other materials in
order to avoid the potential liability risks instead of using
this material.
Mr. Muller. Congressman West, we spend millions of dollars
every year on environmental compliance. We have full-time
environmental engineers on staff. We employ environmental
consultants to ensure our compliance and environmental lawyers.
This is a good example of how this costs us money. We
received a notice of violation a couple of years ago and it was
a paperwork violation. We had not violated any EPA rules but
our paperwork was not exactly correct. So that cost a fine. And
then our lawyers and engineers have to work on that. And then
the next time we submitted our paperwork we failed to note the
NOV that they gave us and we got another notice of violation
for failing to note the notice of violation that they had
already given us. It is just silly and it is all paperwork. We
were operating well within our permits. So it just costs money
chasing our tails.
Mr. West. If I could ask one last question, Mr. Chairman.
So if there was one golden nugget recommendation that you
could give to us to press forward on, what would that golden
nugget recommendation be from each one of you?
Mr. Johnston. From Gevo's standpoint, it is to be able to
provide regulatory certainty in this complex world we live in
and also to be able to talk to EPA and say these are easy
solutions that we are providing as a company. These are not. We
want to change the Clean Air Act. We do not have to change the
40 CFR. These are simple interior pieces in EPA that can be
done that will assist a small business to be able to
commercialize their product.
Mr. Ward. I would agree with Mr. Johnston's plea for
regulatory certainty and add to that that as a small business
committee it would be wonderful if EPA could be encouraged to
follow their already existing guidance for evaluating impacts
on small businesses. And not just direct impacts to the
regulations but the indirect impacts on small businesses. If we
could just get EPA to use their small business advisory review
panel authority and follow the executive orders that they have
already been given to properly assess the impacts on small
businesses, I think we would see a tremendous change. But they
spend most of their time telling us why they do not have to
look at our issues.
Mr. Muller. I would say the rules in place, the standards
on air quality on ozone, on particulate, are already extremely
stringent and protect the air and water. Constantly lowering
these standards to points where they cannot even be met
economically and for very little health benefit in return, that
would be the golden nugget. We just need to keep things where
they are and people can operate and they can hire again and we
will be well in compliance of our permits.
Mr. West. Thank you very much, gentlemen. I yield back.
Chairman Coffman. Mr. Altmire, any further questions?
Mr. Altmire. No.
Chairman Coffman. Mr. West, any further questions?
Mr. West. No, sir.
Chairman Coffman. I would like to thank all of our
witnesses once again for testifying before our Subcommittee.
You have given our members a better perspective of how EPA's
rigorous regulatory agenda is endangering your businesses. It
is alarming to me that this government agency continues to
propose increasingly stringent regulations when small
businesses are already paying environmental costs per employee
at a rate that is 364 percent higher than large businesses,
adding insult to injury. Make no mistake, when EPA and other
agencies effectively over-regulate small business, they also
prevent job creation at a time when our country needs it most.
Today's hearing marks the first step in a long journey of
congressional oversight in matters affecting small businesses.
This Subcommittee, along with the full Committee, will remain
dedicated and vigilant in exposing these and other governmental
hurdles to American prosperity.
I ask unanimous consent that members have five legislative
days to submit statements and supporting materials for the
record. Any objection to that? Without objection, so ordered.
This hearing is now adjourned.
