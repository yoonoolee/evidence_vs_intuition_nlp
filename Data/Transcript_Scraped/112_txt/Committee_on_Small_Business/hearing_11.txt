HEARING ON DRILLING FOR A SOLUTION: FINDING WAYS TO CURTAIL THE
CRUSHING EFFECT OF HIGH GAS PRICES ON SMALL BUSINESS

----------

THURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2011

House of Representatives,
Committee on Small Business, Subcommittee on
Agriculture, Energy and Trade,
Washington, DC.
The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:00 a.m., in
Room 2360, Rayburn House Office Building. Hon. Scott Tipton
[chairman of the Subcommittee].
Present: Representatives Tipton, Fleischmann, Landry,
Critz.
Chairman Tipton. Well, good morning everyone. I would like
to thank you for joining us for this hearing and it will now
come to order.
This is our first Subcommittee hearing and the subject
truly could not be more timely or important. Rising oil and
gasoline prices have a crippling effect on small businesses, as
well as our overall economy. In fact, just this morning the
headline of the Washington Examiner--I will even grab this--it
says gas prices hobble small businesses. When we look at
yesterday's Washington Post, $4 a gallon gas fuel fears stymie
our recovery here.
I would like to extend special thanks to each of our
witnesses for making this trip to Washington, D.C., and taking
time out of your busy schedules. I would especially like to
welcome Jim Ehrlich today, who is a constituent of mine out of
Colorado.
Today we will hear directly from small businesses on how
increased fuel prices have affected their bottom lines and
ability to expand and be able to create jobs. Small businesses
have been hit especially hard by high fuel prices. In addition
to driving up the costs of transportation for their goods and
services, the spike in gas prices is drying up consumers for
many of our small businesses. Just yesterday, Walmart's chief
executive officer told the Washington Post that the retail
giant's number of customersis increasing with rising gas
prices. In an effort to tighten up their budgets by driving less,
consumers tend to consolidate their shopping trips to one larger box
store to be able to do their shopping rather than going to a handful of
community shops where they would normally visit.
This trend is even more alarming when taking into
consideration that many communities across our country have
already seen their consumer bases dwindle in conjunction with
staggering unemployment. We are essentially watching the
extinction of the mom-and-pop shops play out before our very
eyes.
Retailers, of course, are not the only ones feeling the
pinch of high gas prices. As we will hear today, it is hitting
our farmers, our ranchers, especially hard, and any business
that relies on fuel to send or receive their goods and
services. This increased cost of doing business is either
absorbed by the company, diverting resources away from
investment and expansion, or passed along to cash-strapped
consumers who have already tightened their belts in cutting
back. In either case, it is a roadblock to economic security in
this country, economic recovery, and job creation.
In this country, in addition to hearing testimony today, we
will be talking about the direct impact high fuel prices are
having on small businesses. We will explore the root causes of
these rising costs, including overregulation and punitive
taxation on the energy industry. We will look at possible
solutions to jumpstart the energy exploration and production in
our country and discuss the need for the U.S. to embrace an
``all of the above'' energy platform that includes wind, solar,
oil, natural gas, and coal. I look forward to hearing from our
witnesses as they provide testimony today, and we seek to find
solutions to curb the effects of high gas prices on small
businesses.
I would now like to recognize our ranking member, Member
Critz, for his opening statement.
Mr. Critz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And before I go into my
statement I just wanted to thank the witnesses for coming today
to talk about the gas prices, but also to thank Scott, our
chairman. He and I have had a couple of meetings, a couple of
talks, and it looks like we are going to have a very productive
Subcommittee. I am looking forward to working with him on this
issue and on many issues that face small businesses.
Small businesses play a key role in the economy creating
nearly two-thirds of net new jobs. However, with gas prices
rising, their contributions to this growth may be jeopardized.
In the last 3 months, oil prices have reached a 30-month high
exceeding $112 per barrel. With the U.S. importing more than
200 million barrels of oil per month, the cost of doing so is
substantial. Many analysts are suggesting that these increases
could lead to gas prices of $5 or more per gallon. Small
businesses are drivers of economic progress, but a recent
report shows that surges in energy prices are a top concern
among them. According to the PNC Economic Outlook Survey of
Small Firms, nearly three-quarters responded a sustained rise
in energy prices would have a negative impact on their business
potentially restraining growth.
In order to deal with these price increases, small
businesses are often faced with two choices. They can
eitherabsorb the costs or pass them on to their customers. Absorbing
the higher prices creates financial challenges resulting in less
capital to expand their business or hire new employees. Passing the
cost increases on to consumers can reduce demand for a firm's goods and
services. Neither are preferable alternatives and this is why we must
find a solution.
Whether these solutions focus on increasing supply or
reducing demand, it is clear that the status quo is not an
option. Steps must be taken to increase U.S. energy
independence. While much of the price increases are tied to the
uprisings occurring in Northern Africa and the Middle East,
growing demand as the global economy recovers is also a
significant part of this equation. Increasing the supply of oil
can lead to lower gas prices. While there are several options
to do so, one of the most promising is increasing access to
potential oil resources under the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf,
particularly in deepwater areas.
The Department of Energy projects that oil production would
increase from 5 million barrels per day to 7.3 million barrels
per day by 2030 with a complete access to this area. Doing so
could lead to greater domestic oil reserves and ultimately
reduce prices for all consumers of gas, including small
businesses.
Another important energy alternative is to increase the use
of oil shale. I know the Green River Oil Shale Formation in
Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming is estimated to hold the equivalent
of 1.38 trillion barrels of oil equivalent in place. The
Marcellus Shale is the largest unconventional natural gas
formation in the United States. Until recently, the natural gas
in the Marcellus Shale was locked in an impermeable layer of
rock which made the natural gas uneconomical to extract.
However, with the advent of new drilling technologies coupled
with the rising demand for domestic natural gas, the
development of the Marcellus Shale has increased exponentially
in states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia.
The shale is estimated to hold 4.9--excuse me, 493 trillion
cubic feet of extractable natural gas currently valued at more
than $1.8 trillion. As with most economic activity, the impacts
of the natural gas affect more than just the specific firms
directly involved in the industry. There are also important
employment and income effects on local businesses who supply
the industry, such as oil-filled service companies,
restaurants, retailers, and hotels, in addition to effects that
result from employees spending their wages locally.
In Pennsylvania, 75 percent of the natural gas it uses
every day is being imported. The Marcellus Shale Formation
holds enough recoverable natural gas reserves to not only serve
Pennsylvania's needs but to turn our country into a significant
exporter of energy generating equally significant economic
benefits. This is incredible when you think back to 10 years
ago when we were only discussing the importation of this gas.
The high-paying jobs available today in the Marcellus Shale gas
industry are expected to multiply in the future, meeting the
needs of gas companies' efforts to increase drilling and
production across the region. In Pennsylvania alone it is
estimated that more than 110,000 new jobs have been created
because of the development of this shale.
I would just like to emphasize that as long as we develop
this shale in an environmentally responsible manner, its
potential is monumental. This is an immediate source of
alternative energy that is currently being tapped. Excuse me.
As our country continues to develop new sources of energy,
carbon capture and sequestration technology allows it to
continue using coal as a base load fuel while capturing and
sequestering the carbon emissions that would have otherwise
been released into the atmosphere.
The United States has enough coal to meet projected energy
needs for almost 200 years. Here again is another immediate
source of alternative energy. While supply-related options show
great promise, there are equally important policy options that
could reduce demand. Reducing the use ofgas by improving energy
efficiency measures could also lead to lower prices. Small businesses
can readily do this by adopting new technologies such as replacing gas-
based vehicles with hybrid flex-fuel or electric-based cars and trucks.
This would lessen their and our nation's need for oil. By doing so,
entrepreneurs would face less volatility in their energy costs.
Several initiatives are spearheading the replacement of
gas-based vehicles. Small businesses have been encouraged to
purchase more fuel efficient vehicles through tax credits,
including gasoline electric hybrids and plug-in electric
vehicles. In addition, substantial funding has been provided to
advance research into alternative automotive energy and fuel
cell technologies. As commercialization occurs, small
businesses will have a broader array of energy efficient
vehicles to choose from. Whether it is increasing the domestic
supply of oil or decreasing demand, everything should be on the
table to help reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Doing so
will not only benefit small businesses and consumers but will
increase our nation's energy security as we can reinvest
savings into alternative fuels.
In this regard, I am particularly looking forward to
hearing the witnesses' views on policy options and what effect
they could have on prices. If we do nothing, rising gas prices
have the potential to dramatically impact small businesses and
disrupt the recovery we are currently experiencing. If small
firms are going to lead the economy forward and create new
jobs, they need greater predictability and less volatility in
the prices they pay for energy. I hope today's hearing is a
step forward in this direction.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Chairman Tipton. Well, thank you, Ranking Member Critz.
Talking about developing energy here at home we are going to
get along just fine. I do appreciate that.
I am a small businessman. This is the first Committee
hearing that I am chairing. I would like to thank our chairman
for having the privilege of being able to do this. Sam is very
gracious. And I would also like to give a tip of our hat to our
staff as well. A lot of the work that goes on behind the scenes
to be able to put one of these together is extraordinary. And I
really appreciate all of the help. And Mindi, thank you for
your help as well.
So if other Committee members do have an opening statement
prepared I would ask that they submit that for the record
today.
And I would like to take a moment, gentlemen, to be able to
explain our lighting system in front of you. You will each have
five minutes for your testimony. The light will start out as
green. Once it gets to the four-minute level it will then turn
to yellow, and at the expiration of time it will then turn red.
And I would ask that you wrap up your comments at that point
and we would appreciate it as you finish.

STATEMENTS OF JIM EHRLICH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COLORADO POTATO

ASSOCIATION; DICK PINGEL, OWNER, FINALLY TRUCKING, INC.; ROBERT
WEINER, PROFESSOR, INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS, PUBLIC POLICY AND
PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, GEORGE
WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY

Chairman Tipton. So it is my pleasure right now to be able
to introduce our first witness today, a constituent of mine,
Mr. Jim Ehrlich.
Jim is the executive director of the Colorado Potato
Administrative Committee, representing a significant industry
in my home district. Jim, we appreciate you being here today
and we look forward to your testimony.

STATEMENT OF JIM EHRLICH

Mr. Ehrlich. Well, I would like to thank Chairman Tipton
and the Committee for inviting me today.
I speak on behalf of the 170 different potato growers in
the San Luis Valley of South Central Colorado. These growers
typically produce about 2.2 billion pounds of potatoes a year
with a market price of 175- to $240 million depending on the
price of potatoes that year. The San Luis Valley is a high
alpine desert, base elevation of 7,600 feet with less than 7
inches of moisture annually. Irrigation supplies are dependent
on abundant snowpack and sustained utilization of a vast
underground aquifer. Colorado ranks as the second largest
shipper of fresh market potatoes in the country, a fact that
many people do not know.
This 6-county region of Colorado is dependent upon
agriculture as the economic engine for the valley's 50,000
residents. Unfortunately, we possess some of the poorest
counties in Colorado with many rural families having incomes
below poverty level and without opportunity for better jobs.
Today I am going to focus on three things: the impact of
high energy prices and gas prices on potato producers in the
valley, the inability of the United States to increase domestic
production of our vast energy reserves, and the cost of
regulation to potato producers, the impact of high energy and
gas prices on potato producers.
I recently read a report claiming that for every 10 cent
increase in gas prices there is a net loss of $5 billion to the
United States' economy. When you consider the fragile state of
the worldwide economy and our economy in the United States,
this has great significance. When you consider that petroleum-
based products are the only source for most of the
transportation needs in the world today, there is no real
mystery why when you have one supply and limited supply of that
one item and worldwide demand is growing like it is, why there
is a problem.
Agriculture requires energy as a critical input to
production. Potato production uses energy directly as fuel and
electricity to operate tractors and equipment, cool potato
cellars, process and package product indirectly, and
fertilizers and chemicals produced off the farm but needed as
critical inputs for crop production. Total energy costs of an
irrigated potato crop in the San Luis Valley can be as great as
50 percent of the total production expenses.
Unlike areas of the country where irrigation is unnecessary
or no-till practices are common, this is not the case with
potato production in the San Luis Valley. It requires large
amounts of electricity to irrigate and large amounts of
tillage. Crop must be stored at the correct temperature and
humidity year round to ensure marketable condition for
consumers. The crop must be shipped in refrigerated trucks to
distant markets across the country throughout the year.
So what happens when gas prices rise like they have this
year? Because farmers are price takers and lack the capacity to
pass on higher costs through the food marketing chain, the net
result is a loss in farm income. The reality is prices of most
fuel sources tend to move together. So as gas prices typically
rise, other energy prices rise in concert. Fertilizer prices
are dependent upon natural gas prices and potatoes require
large amounts of nitrogen, phosphate, and pot ash fertilizers.
Harvest, sorting, grading, and shipping are all heavily
mechanized energy-dependent steps. The San Luis Valley is
located in an isolated mountainous region. High diesel prices
affect freight rates and truck availability cutting into the
growers' bottom line.
The economic reality for our area is when gas prices rise,
farmers make less money. The local economy suffers because it
is dependent on the farmers. Farmers are forced to cut back on
expenditures and this lack of economic activity impacts local
businesses and communities, school districts, et cetera, the
inability of the United States to increase domestic production
of vast energy reserves.
Because the United States relies on imported sources of oil
for over 60 percent of our oil needs, we export wealth daily,
primarily to countries that are hostile to us. This not only
causes economic stress but is a threat to our national
security. Without a stable source of relative economical energy
for agriculture, our nation's food security is at risk also,
and as a result, our national security. As the proud father of
a U.S. Marine serving in Afghanistan currently, I speak from my
heart.
I recently read a report from the Congressional Research
Service detailing the potential fossil fuel reserves of the
world. This report came out in December. I was encouraged to
see the United States might actually have the largest fossil
fuel reserves in the world, but I was distraught because as a
country we continually fail to develop these resources. It is
time to find bipartisan solutions to develop all energy
resources available in this country,including alternative
energy sources. Energy prices are going to continue to rise with
increasing worldwide demand, even if we develop every source of energy
we have available as quickly as possible. Failure to act puts our great
nation and its ability to feed the world at risk.
The last thing I want to talk about is the cost of
regulation to potato producers. I encourage the Committee to
consider the economic impact overregulation has on agriculture
and small businesses across the country. Any new regulation
should be thoroughly analyzed for the often unintended economic
consequences that result. I applaud the recent House vote to
prevent unnecessary NPDES permits that were actually being
forced on agriculture without just cause.
As a nation, we have to respect and consider everyone's
opinion when we make decisions affecting the environment, food
safety, school meal plans, et cetera. But as elected officials,
you have the responsibility to create laws that carefully
represent the beneficial interest of the majority of citizens.
It is not impossible to please all interests and I know this
because I work with farmers and make progress.
An example of this overregulation is the EPA. I cannot even
begin to go there but I will point out one example. They are
proposing dust regulations for rural America and they do not
have the data to show that these regulations are an actual
problem. They do not even have a rural dust monitoring network.
The reality is rural America is dusty. Potatoes grow in the
dirt, the good dirt that feeds all of us.
In closing, I would like to thank the Committee for the
opportunity to testify today. Colorado potato growers are very
grateful for the work you are doing and the commitment you have
to agriculture and our nation. Thank you very much.

Chairman Tipton. Thank you very much, Jim. I appreciate
your testimony.
Our next witness is Mr. Rick Richter, who has flown as an
agricultural pilot for over 32 years and is the proprietor of
Richter Aviation. He is the current president of National
Agricultural Aviation Association and represents them in his
testimony today. Mr. Richter.

STATEMENT OF RICK RICHTER

Mr. Richter. Thank you, Chairman Tipton, Ranking Member
Critz, and all members of the Subcommittee for the opportunity
to testify on the effects that the increase in fuel prices have
on small aerial application businesses.
My name is Rick Richter, owner of Richter Aviation, an
aerial application business in Maxwell, California. And I am
testifying today on behalf of the National Agricultural
Aviation Association, also known as the NAAA, of which I am the
2011 president.
NAAA is a national association which represents the
interests of small business owners and pilot licensed as
commercial applicators that use aircraft to enhance the
production of food, fiber, and biofuel, protect forestry and
control health threatening pests.
Aerial application accounts for an estimated 18 percent of
commercially applied crop protection products in the United
States and is often the only method for timely pesticide
application, especially when wet soil conditions, rolling
terrain, or dense plant foliage presents the use of other
methods of treating an area for pests.
The average aerial application business consists of two
operating aircraft, four people, including two pilots, a mixer-
loader, and an administrative staffer. Increases in fuel prices
result in a number of cash flow and service marketability
issues for the aerial application industry. And, of course, the
price of fuel for agriculture will trickle down to the end
consumer of food.
According to the United Nations' Food and Agricultural
Organization, food prices reached a record high in February,
and prices in March of this year remain 37 percent higher than
those in March of 2010.
At the beginning of the season, an aerial applicator sets a
base price per acre treated by air based on the expected cost
of operation. This is the amount he charges his farmer clients.
Depending on the type of fuel used, of which there are two--
avgas for piston engineered aircraft and Jet A for turbine
engine ag aircraft--an operator includes a base price for fuel
going into the season. Some applicators stick with this price
regardless of fluctuations in fuel price, and as a result may
lose money when prices go up steeply. Other applicators will
incorporate a fuel surcharge into their pricing structure.
Incorporated within that fee per acre charge is the fuel
charge which is based on an average price of fuel per gallon.
This ranges but on average it is estimated to be about $2 per
gallon. If fuel rises above that figure, a fuel surcharge is
added, and a typical fuel surcharge is the difference between
the average price for a gallon of fuel that an applicator
builds into his acre charge and the price of a gallon of
aviation fuel at the time of application, assuming that the
latter is a greater amount, multiplied by the average number of
gallons burned by that particular aircraft in an hour
multiplied by the amount of time it took to make the
application for the farmer.
Fuel surcharges in our industry have been met with minimal
complaint by farmer clients as of late because they will be
getting a good price for the crop. If this was 2002 and we were
faced with the same high prices for fuel that we are facing
today but ag commodity prices were two to three times lower
than what they are today, our industry would be facing some
real challenges. As of April 6, 2011, the wholesale price of
Jet A without taxes was $3.33 per gallon as quoted by a large
Southeast U.S. fuel supplier. If in 2002 when commodity prices
were much lower and Jet A fuel for turbine-powered ag aircraft
was the same price today or the same price that it was at its
height in 2008 when it averaged $4.72 per gallon, it would be
much tougher for a farmer to embrace a fuel surcharge for
aerial application services rendered.
Realistically, when input prices such as fuel are high and
commodity prices are low, a significant drop in the use of
aerial application services and other farm services would occur
as a result of containing costs. Well, this helps the farmer
contain expenses but frequently results in less yield and poor
crop quality, hence negatively affecting his revenue potential.
The lack of application work is a challenge for an aerial
application operator that requires steady business each season
to remain viable.
Another challenge that aerial applicators face,
particularly when fuel prices are high, is the financial terms
that fuel suppliers have for payment of their fuel and how
those terms differ from their own accounts receivable terms.
The typical payment term that an aerial applicator has with his
fuel supplier is 10 days with established credit. This usually
differs from payment terms that aerial applicators' customers
are accustomed to paying, which is typically between 45 and 60
days. This can pose challenges because fuel costs consist of
approximately 20 percent of an aerial applicator's total
expenses. If the average ag aircraft burns 50 gallons per hour
and is flown 300 hours per season and there are 2.2 aircraft on
average per aerial application operation, then 38,600--excuse
me, 36,816 gallons of fuel will be required.
When an applicator is facing a deficit in accounts payable
compared to his accounts receivable and outlaying large chunks
of capital for fuel particularly when the price of fuel is
high, this may result in sizeable interest payments for small
aerial application businesses. It is widely expected that
higher interest rates will return and coupled with the greater
demand for fuel globally will likely lead to a steady increase
in the price of fuel and place much greater cost pressures on
small aerial application businesses. High fuel cost conditions
in some instances do lead to aerial applicators taking more
risk in trying to hedge the price of fuel by filling up their
tanks early and storing fuel. But storing for too long of a
period can result in developing moisture in the fuel, algae
problems in Jet A, and possibly evaporation of avgas.
One other issue of concern to the agricultural aviation
industry that is related to fuel supply is an effort underway
to phase out the use of avgas. EPA has mentioned the
possibility of a new environmental standard associated with
avgas due to its emissions of lead in the air and calls by
environmental activists to ban the fuel completely. Avgas is
used in 51.87 percent of ag aircraft in the U.S. today. NAAA's
primary concerns are with the safety and feasibility issues
associated with mandated a shift from avgas. NAAA hasencouraged
the EPA and the FAA to allow time for and devote resources toward the
development of a suitable alternative to avgas before imposing avgas
regulations or banning the use of the fuel altogether. NAAA urged the
agency to consider the detrimental economic impacts that could occur to
our industry and the farmers that rely on us should avgas be phased out
prior to the development of a safe and practical alternate fuel. Piston
engines are a notably less expensive engine for ag aircraft compared
with turbine engines and for smaller aerial application businesses it
may be the only affordable type of power plant available.
Chairman Tipton, Ranking Member Critz, thank you very much
for the opportunity to explain these issues affecting the
aerial application industry in regards to the increase in fuel
prices and supply for ag aviation aircraft. More detail on the
issue and how it affects the aerial application industry can be
found in the written comments that we have submitted. A
national policy that can be developed that would ensure a
stable price and supply for Jet A and avgas is imperative for
our industry and the farmer clients we treat. Also,
continuation of the fuel tax exemption for aviation fuel used
for large aircraft while flying over the farm has provided some
relief to our farmer customers.
Our industry provides a valuable service in aiding in the
production of the safe, affordable, and abundant global supply
of food, fiber, and biofuel, and as such, a steady supply and
price of fuel is vitally important to us and our farmer
customers. Thank you again to you and the members of the
Subcommittee.

Chairman Tipton. Thank you, Mr. Richter. We appreciate your
testimony.
I would like to now introduce Mr. Dick Pingel, who has been
an owner-operator trucker for over 28 years, and I also have it
on good authority that Mr. Pingel has personally driven over
three million miles without a single accident. That is notable.
The Subcommittee appreciates you taking the time to speak with
us today, Mr. Pingel.

STATEMENT OF DICK PINGEL

Mr. Pingel. Good morning. My name is Dick Pingel. I live in
Plover, Wisconsin, and have been a small business trucker for
the past 28 years. I am a member of Owner-Operators Independent
Drivers Association and currently run a one-truck operation
hauling food around the country.
As you are most likely aware, O-O-I-D-A, or OOIDA as it is
known in the trucking industry, is a national trade association
representing the interests of small business trucking
professionals and professional truck drivers. The more than
152,000 members of OOIDA are small business men and women in
all 50 states who collectively own and operate more than
200,000 individual heavy-duty trucks.
The majority of the trucking community in this country is
made up of small businesses as 93 percent of all carriers have
less than 20 trucks in their fleet and 78 percent of carriers
have just 6 or fewer trucks. In fact, a one-truck operation
such as me represents nearly half of the total number of
federally registered motor carriers. Assuming that the trucking
industry exclusively moves about 70 percent of our nation's
goods and that just about all freight is moved by truck at some
point in the supply chain, it is not hard to see that the costs
and burdens that encumber small business truckers have an
impact on our nation's businesses and consumers. The cost of
fuel is very often the largestoperating expense with which
small business truckers must contend. For folks like me, fuel costs can
easily be 50 percent or more of our annual operating expenses. To give
you some perspective, the average OOIDA member runs their truck about
120,000 miles or more each year while getting somewhere in the ballpark
of only 7 miles per gallon. Most of us will be operating trucks
equipped with either twin 135-gallon tanks or twin 150-gallon tanks, so
we can easily see a bill of over 1,000 dollars when we fill up.
In addition to the fuel going into the tanks of my tractor,
I use a trailer with a diesel-powered refrigerating unit to
haul dairy products for producers in Wisconsin. Until recently,
I could count on it costing about $50 to fill up my tank for
the reefer unit. However, in recent months the cost to fill
this tank has increased to more than $100. The additional money
I am now spending on fuel for my truck and trailer once went
into investing in other areas of my business, but now it must
cover basic operating expenses. Every time I pull into a truck
stop I hear similar stories, as truckers are paying
significantly more at the pump.
The national average for diesel is now around $4.12 a
gallon, with prices in some states approaching $4.50 per
gallon. To put this into perspective, each time the price of a
gallon of diesel fuel increases by a nickel, a trucker's annual
cost increases by $1,000. Diesel prices today are more than a
dollar higher than they were this time last year, resulting in
an enormous extra burden on small business truckers whose
average annual income is less than $40,000. However, unlike
past spikes in fuel prices, the recent increases in the cost of
fuel are not occurring in isolation. Over the past few years,
the trucking industry has been laboring under a steadily
increasing amount of costly and often unnecessary regulations
which, when coupled with the rising cost of fuel, are certain
to force many small business truckers in very difficult, if not
insurmountable economic situations.
Small business truckers operate in a hyper competitive
market, so managing their number one expense is imperative for
their survival. In our marketplace, we often see costs increase
without any corresponding rate increases. As such, the only way
to survive is to become more efficient in how one operates
their truck. Small business truckers always drive with an eye
towards saving fuel no matter what the price because our
business survival depends on it. As small business truckers
like myself know, reducing fuel costs is not a science, it is
an art and one that we pride ourselves on being masters of.
However, our ability to practice this is made more difficult by
increased regulation and artificially high fuel prices, issues
we look forward to working with Congress to address.
Thank you for this opportunity to speak with you, and I
look forward to answering any questions that you may have.

STATEMENT OF ROBERT WEINER

Mr. Weiner. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, other members,
thank you very much for the opportunity to be here. I would
like to say that I am not representing anyone except for myself
as a student of the industry.
What I would like to do is divide my remarks into three
parts. First, where prices are and where they are going and the
implication for small business; second, political risk and the
impact of political risk, including political risk in the
United States on investment in the oil industry, oil
production, and eventually prices; and third, time permitting,
the causes of the underlying increase in oil prices.
First, the key question for everyone especially for small
business, is how to adapt to higher and more volatile prices.
In order to figure this out we have to get a sense of where
prices are going and also where they are likely to be in the
future in an industry in the United States that produces over 5
million barrels a day. The average well produces 10 barrels a
day. So I would like to remind people here that the small
business that we discuss includes the oil industry. There are
many small businesses in the oil industry, both in conventional
oil but also in the newly emerging technologies that will be
important in the future, such as shale and services for
deepwater exploration.
In order to look at forecasts, we need to get a sense of
what the market thinks. I am not a forecaster but I am a
consumer of oil price forecasts, and the advantage of the
market forecasts are three. The first is that they are widely
available, and like some of the best things in life they are
actually free. You do not have to pay for them. Second is they
reflect the consensus of many, many small buyers and sellers in
the market, putting their own capital at risk and their
clients' capital, and they will lose if their forecasts are
wrong. And then finally, the tendency of these forecasts to be
right on average. In other words, these forecasts are on bias.
Whatever the forecast is for the end of the year, which is
about $105 a barrel, the chances are equal that it will be too
high and too low.
What the forecast tells us is four things. First, that
people expect the price increase to be permanent, where
permanent in my world means six or seven years. The futures
price for the end of 2016 is $105 a barrel, only slightly below
today's $110 a barrel. And, of course, future price
expectations include expectations about the deliberations of
this August body in terms of the ability of the U.S. or the
lack of the ability of the U.S. to increase production. And so
that skepticism or concern is inherent in prices.
Second is prices are expected to stay high but to plateau.
No future increase in prices unless there are some political
events that are hard to predict such as those in Libya or Japan
or indeed in the Gulf of Mexico.
The idea of peak oil, which is the third idea, is simply
not supported by expected prices. Peak oil suggests we are
running out of oil. I think we have seen the entrepreneurship
and the ingenuity and technology of business in the United
States. The ability to, at least for now, stay well ahead of
the battle against depletion and to be able to increase, if
allowed, by regulation our domestic energy production.
And finally, there is no intrinsic value for oil. All of us
who may have hoped that just because prices are higher than
historically now means that they will go back to previous
levels, the forecast says that they will not. The new normal is
that there is no normal.
Because I am running out of time I would like to switch to
talk about political risk. Political risk restricts investment
at all levels. Political risk is not something that we think
about just for a country like Libya or Iraq. Political risk is
very much present in the U.S., especially in the deepwater Gulf
of Mexico and in shale because of uncertainties about
environmental effects and difficulties of the industry in
getting permits and permission to drill. Right now an enormous
amount of industry capital is tied up essentially doing nothing
or very little, wondering when permits will be issued. The
industry has long been able to deal with regulation and taxes
as long as it is clear. As the president of Exxon said a few
days ago, the U.S. is a very difficult country to do business
right now. Political risk means it is hard to figure out
whether the industry should invest. Without more investment
there will not be more production, and without more production
there can only be higher prices.
I see that I am out of time so I will reserve the rest of
my remarks for my written testimony. Thank you very much.

Chairman Tipton. Thank you Dr. Weiner. We certainly
appreciate your testimony and paying attention to the lights,
too. We often ignore them up here.
I appreciate all of you gentlemen taking the time for being
able to join us today and I will start out our questioning
here. And I would like to start out with my constituent, Jim
Ehrlich.
Jim, I do not think that Americans truly realize the
significant amount of energy that is necessary to be able to
produce food stuffs in our country that we eat daily. Given
that upwards of 50 percent of total production expenses are
reliant upon energy costs as you noted in your testimony, do
you believe that if oil prices reach or exceed, and they
already have now, the 2008 gas price level of $4 a gallon that
it will force potato farmers out of business or force them to
make substantial cutbacks?
Mr. Ehrlich. Well, I think that they will definitely have
to cut back but I think the key to that is the price of
potatoes. This year the price of potatoes is quite high, as all
commodity prices are. As a matter of fact, a lot of commodity
prices are at all-time highs. Whether that is sustainable,
history would tell us no. So I would say that they will
definitely be hurt. If potato prices go back to last year's
levels, it will force producers out of production.
Chairman Tipton. Well, I thought it was worthy of note in
your testimony you were talking about the domino effect. If the
potato farmer is not doing well, essentially you were noting
that the person who operates the local theatre or the local
drive-in is going to be impacted as well. Are you seeing that
as well in our rural communities?
Mr. Ehrlich. Well, I would say since the economy had the
downturn, our area of the country has suffered. And it was
not--it did not happen rapidly in agricultural rural areas like
that, sometimes the effect happens a little later. But I would
say we are actually--we are not out of a recession in the area
that I live in. And if the farmers are the only ones making
money down there right now, this rise in fuel prices will
definitely have a detrimental effect on our area.
Chairman Tipton. Great. Thanks, Jim.
Dr. Weiner, as you know, President Obama's 2012 budget
included roughly $90 billion on taxes on the energy industry.
Given your testimony that you just presented, do you believe
that implementing more stringent tax policies on energy
producers will contribute to higher prices at the pump?
Mr. Weiner. I think it will but I think what is most
important is that the energy producers know what the taxes are.
I think the thing that is most difficult is when they do not.
And one important aspect of higher taxes and tax uncertainty is
value destruction. In the current budget for the U.K. that was
just released a couple of weeks ago there was a sharp rise on
taxes proposed for U.K. and foreign oil producers. The
immediate effect was a 15 to 20 percent destruction of value of
those investments. So these taxes go right to the bottom line
and where there is destruction in value of the asset, of course
there will be less investment and eventually less production
and higher prices.
Chairman Tipton. Great. Thank you.
Mr. Richter, in your testimony you pointed out that
potential EPA regulations on avgas, which is still being used
by the majority of agricultural aviators, you noted that there
is no viable alternative right now for avgas. If gas
restrictions are put into place, would this effectively close a
lot of our sprayers?
Mr. Richter. Mr. Chairman, yes, it would. It would
definitely close some of the smaller businesses that are using
piston-engine aircraft. What you have got to understand is that
the larger turbine aircraft are several times more expensive
than the smaller ones, and if it would restrict or if there is
a ban completely on avgas you would see probably some of those
going out of business because small businesses could not afford
the larger turbine aircraft. And it would eventually have an
effect on food prices in the end.
Chairman Tipton. Great. Mr. Pingel, you indicated that over
the last five months, 15 new major regulatory rulemaking
proposals were proposed on the trucking industry. Can you
highlight some of the most significant new regulations that you
are seeing come out?
Mr. Pingel. Well, we have seen laws come out at FMCSA on
onboard recorders, on speed limiters, on cell phone use. We
have seen, not so much in the last five months but in the last
few years, 07-10, we have had EPA regulations coming out for
emissions on the trucks and those have all, you know, we have
had to pay for those.
Chairman Tipton. Just kind of curious. You know, in your
commentary that is over and above when you noted that for every
nickel increase in a gallon of gasoline that is a thousand
dollars a month if I recall correctly or $1,000 annually in
terms of cost.
Mr. Pingel. Annually.
Chairman Tipton. These are for independent small business
people earning $40,000 a year?
Mr. Pingel. Correct. And that comes off the bottom line.
Chairman Tipton. So the increased regulations that we are
seeing are hurting small businesses, costing consumers more,
and hurting the American economy?
Mr. Pingel. Correct.
Chairman Tipton. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. I
would like to now yield to Ranking Member Critz for questioning
of the witnesses.
Mr. Critz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, what is
interesting about these hearings is that usually we come with
prepared questions and then as we listen, all these other
questions come to light that we want to ask. And Mr. Ehrlich,
you had mentioned about in your area the downturn in the
economy usually hits slower and it stays longer. I am from
rural Pennsylvania and it is usually an indicator in most rural
indicators that it takes longer for recessions to hit but it
usually hangs on longer and it takes our areas longer to
recover as well. And although our hearing is about gas prices,
you hit on something that is really a sore spot for me as well.
And actually, my question is going to be to Dr. Weiner, is
that EPA regulations--and you know, we did just take the vote
on the NPDES--but you had mentioned, Dr. Weiner, about EPA
regulations and the need for stability and ways for companies,
whether they be oil, gas, or any company, to be able to plan
based on what a stable environment looks like in the future.
And I am curious if you can, although it is sort of off the
track of gasoline, if you could comment on some of the actions
currently that are going on at EPA, what you see, and what the
future looks like and what we need to do up here at the
congressional level to try to create that stable playing field
for industry.
Mr. Weiner. I apologize, Congressman, I am not an expert on
EPA at all. I know more about energy than the environment.
I think in general when you are looking at regulations,
some regulations affect the bottom line of producing companies
a lot more than others. Those are the ones where stability and
certainty are really the most important. And there may be a lot
of regulations and some of them may be irrelevant or a nuisance
but they may not have as big an effect on the bottom line. The
question is where does it--where does the buck stop? That's
when the question about whether it affects people's decision on
investment. The little description that I gave you about the
increase in taxes which is just as important for stability in
the North Sea, the first thing that happened is some of the
companies said we are reassessing because these are high cost
fuels to produce. We may not be investing anything. If they do
not invest, no production. And no production simply means that
more and more of our oil is going to come from places like
Venezuela and Iraq and places that we have come to depend on.
Mr. Critz. Okay. And I think it is that stability. You
mentioned at some point there is a whole lot of people sitting
around waiting for permits and different things whichmeans
there is no production going on. And like I said, that is sort of a
sore spot for me. And when you mentioned the EPA and NPDES and you
mentioned it, I thought, sorry, I have got to veer off here because I
have got a thorn in my side and I am trying to extract it.
Mr. Pingel, I have one question for you that, again, it is
about gas prices but it is also about infrastructure. Is that
there is a debate going on about--and actually this could be
for anyone who wants to comment--a debate going on about
highway--the reauthorization of the highway bill and what it
means to infrastructure, building our infrastructure. And we
have a huge issue because of lack of money in the Highway Trust
Fund to do a lot of these projects. So there is a lot of debate
going back and forth on increasing a gas tax. And, of course,
in our neck of the woods that is, you know, talking about
increasing taxes is nothing that anybody ever wants to talk
about but when you are talking about infrastructure sometimes
you have to have a tough nut to swallow.
I would be curious what your thoughts are being in the
trucking industry you are on the highways all the time, and
actually in aviation as well. What that means, you know, what
the lack of a highway bill means to you folks.
Mr. Pingel. Well, I think as far as the gas tax, we
realize, the industry realizes that we have to pay for the
infrastructure and we know that it is crumbling. But we also
see that if we can improve the infrastructure, we can save
ourselves money and congestion and, you know, wear and tear on
equipment. It is just a matter of taking that money, you know,
that we pay in and using it for infrastructure, not for high-
speed rail and bullet trains and bike paths and some of the
other stuff. I mean, as an industry, I mean, like I said, we
realize that we use it probably more than anybody else and we
are willing to pay for it but we want that money to stay where
it goes.
Mr. Critz. Right. Right. Okay. Any comment, Mr. Richter?
Mr. Richter. I might add that many of the agricultural
operations, aviation operations, occur on airstrips that are
not improved. They are on private airstrips. And we are very
fortunate to have a fuel tax exemption. And that has been real
good for our industry. It has served us very well. But as such,
we rarely use improved airstrips.
Mr. Critz. Okay. Well, I appreciate that.
Mr. Chairman, I have about a thousand questions but in the
interest of time I will yield to other members of the Committee
so that they can ask their questions and on the second round we
will come back around. Thank you very much.
Chairman Tipton. Thank you, Member Critz. And I would now
like to recognize Congressman Fleischmann.
Mr. Fleischmann. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, thank you
very much.
Gentlemen, this is outstanding. I have really enjoyed this
testimony so far. It is very helpful.
My name is Chuck Fleischmann. I represent the 3rd District
of Tennessee. In addition to serving with the chairman on this
Committee, I serve on the Committee of Natural Resources,
Energy, and Minerals Subcommittee with my distinguished
colleague, Mr. Landry. I am also on the Small Business
Committee, so this has really brought my three disciplines
together and I have enjoyed this very much and I thank you.
Dr. Weiner, I appreciate your comments on this and I
listened very, very intently. One of my goals and one of my
passions is to encourage the development of our natural
resources in this country--coal, oil, natural gas. I think we
have got the domestic resources, particularly the oil, to go
out and harvest and develop it. When we were talking, and I
appreciate your discussion about value destruction and the
like, we were talking about taxes. I am generally adverse to
taxes. Okay? Overwhelming. But with the Obama administration's
proposed taxes on the oil industry, I think that would be
viewed more as a deterrent. You mentioned the term about
predictability. What would bethe best thing in your view to get
the industry to be more attractive as an investment to go out and to
develop our oil resources?
Mr. Weiner. Congressman, I think you make some very good
points. I think the single most important thing is access and
stability about access. Right now people who have invested
hundreds of millions in heavy equipment in the Gulf of Mexico
are watching their equipment stay idle. Of course, that is
costing a lot of money. People are uncertain about the ability
to lease things, both on land and offshore. Uncertainty about
environmental treatments. And so one of the questions about
shale gas which extends to your state as well is about the
ability to exploit shale gas given environmental uncertainties.
Resolution of uncertainty is very important. Just like the
trucking industry, the oil industry can live with taxes as long
as the industry knows what the taxes are. And when you get a
lot of uncertainty and flipping back and forth in policy,
people in the industry do not know what to do. That is where
the value destruction comes. If you cannot exploit the asset,
as you mentioned the natural resources, it is just lying idle
it is not contributing any value to society.
Mr. Fleischmann. Okay, thank you. Dr. Weiner, I wanted to
ask you something about the permitting process. It seems to
have been impeded greatly by this administration. Have you
delved into that and ways it perhaps could be alleviated so
that we could get more permits so that we could actually go
about recovering our resources? As you say, these people have
got the rates and the machines ready to go but they cannot get
the permits at a rapid enough pace. It has been impeded greatly
until lately. They just recently eased up. Do you have any
thoughts about that, sir?
Mr. Weiner. Very important question, Congressman. The big
change has been the change in regulations associated with the
Deepwater Horizon accident from exactly a year ago. The
procedures have changed and, therefore, the review process
changed and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management that does
this permitting does not have much of a staff. And so unless
you guys see it appropriate to give them the resources that
they need it will be hard for them to get more permits. They
have a very small number of staff members for a lot of ocean
out there, so one of the things you have got to do is give them
the resources and the industry, like the trucking industry, has
a good return on capital and would much, much prefer having a
stable process where they know they can get their permit
process as opposed to just sitting on someone's desk. That is
much more important than just having lower taxes.
Mr. Fleischmann. Thank you, Dr. Weiner. Thank you,
gentlemen. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Tipton. Thank you, Congressman Fleischmann. I
would now like to introduce Congressman Landry for questioning.
Mr. Landry. Mr. Chairman, I have got to tell you I cannot
thank you enough for bringing Professor Weiner here. I am going
to work on trying to get you in front of the Natural Resources
Committee. Your testimony today has been enlightening in an
argument that we have been making for the past month and a half
in that committee.
But I want to make sure that what I am hearing is correct.
We have the ability or do you believe that we have the ability
that an increase in production in this country of oil has the
ability to affect the price?
Mr. Weiner. Yes, Congressman, it does.
Mr. Landry. Thank you. Thank you.
The other question--and of course I represent the 3rd
District of Louisiana which is along the coast. All that idle
iron that you are talking about, all of those hundreds of
million dollars in investment of my constituents and my
business owners that are reeling from this de facto moratorium
and the policies that this administration is putting on us. One
of the things that I found amazing is that the price of natural
gas seems to have stabilized over the course of, I would guess,
the last 24 to maybe 36 months. Would that be a correct
statement?
Mr. Weiner. Yes, you are seeing the effects already of the
shale gas investment and the shale gas production. Shale gas
has come online much earlier than people expected and so now
you have a disconnect where gas is much less expensive relative
to oil than in the past. And I think one of the opening remarks
of one of your colleagues said the U.S. has the capability in a
few years to be actually an exporter of gas which would help
our country in a number of different ways.
Mr. Landry. Would you say that prior to that trend oil and
natural gas, that prices moved in cadence from peaks and
valleys when you look at the graph, I guess, in the last 30--
other than say from 2008, I guess, from the time the shale
plays were put into play, but prior to that that oil and gas
basically moved in cadence? When oil was up, gas was up.
Mr. Weiner. That was true most of the time because gas has
a restricted transportation system. When you have something
like a freeze in the central part of the country where you
cannot get more gas in there you sometimes had these peaks and
spikes in natural gas prices that you did not see in oil,
especially in the cold winter. But your statement is true, over
the longer term they tended to move together.
Mr. Landry. Now, when they move together, I am just
curious, I do not know the answer to that but when they move
together, we were still importing a tremendous amount of our
oil but we were not importing a lot of natural gas. Was it just
that oil drew gas up or was it truly a supply and demand issue?
Mr. Weiner. Well, Congressman, I believe that everything is
truly a supply and demand issue.
Mr. Landry. Me, too. I am confused by it.
Mr. Weiner. The U.S. imported about 10 to 15 percent of our
natural gas needs so we were importing primarily from Canada,
but also liquefied natural gas to Louisiana and other places.
Oil and gas--oil is priced in a world market so we have an
influence. If we produce more, that will put downward pressure
on oil prices; if we produce less, it will put upward pressure
on oil prices. Natural gas is more of a local or regional
phenomenon, so it tends to track oil but not exactly. Until
some of my distinguished colleagues on the panel can put
natural gas more easily into their transportation equipment,
natural gas will continue to sell at a discount to oil. Seventy
percent of the nation's oil consumption is in transportation.
Mr. Landry. And I only have one minute but it is a great
point because my question would be if we move natural gas, aka
transportation-type fuel, we would recognize there would be a
bump in the cost of natural gas. But based upon the supply that
we have in the country would that be--how great would that rise
be do you believe? Would it be a dollar? Two dollars? Would it
be 5-, $6?
Mr. Weiner. I think nobody knows for sure. The outlook for
natural gas, especially with shale, is very promising. And so I
am afraid that if we do not do as you suggest, the price of
natural gas could go way down and that would hurt the natural
gas producers and all the associated businesses that supply the
natural gas industry. So I actually think that making natural
gas into more of a transportation fuel would help support the
domestic industry.
Mr. Landry. So it would actually act as a buffer, both
protecting the natural gas industry but also keeping the price
at a stable level?
Mr. Weiner. That is correct.
Mr. Landry. Maybe just a little higher than it is today but
nothing near the records that we are seeing oil at?
Mr. Weiner. Nobody knows for sure but I think that is a
very good guess, Congressman.
Mr. Landry. Thank you so much. Thank you again. Excellent.
Sorry, guys.
Chairman Tipton. Thank you, Mr. Landry and Mr. Weiner. We
appreciate that.
I would like to do one follow-up question and I know the
ranking member has a couple.
Mr. Ehrlich, I saw your head bobbing when we were talking
about being able to use natural gas. Is that a good viable
alternative for our agricultural community?
Mr. Ehrlich. Well, I think it could be. Probably the reason
my head was bobbing was I was thinking about fertilizer
production and the cost of natural gas because that is a huge
deal for our producers. And quite frankly, most of the
fertilizer coming into the United States today or actually most
production of fertilizer in the United States today is
imported. And so I was just--I think natural gas would be a
good choice for vehicles but I do not know enough about it to
make a good comment.
Chairman Tipton. Thank you. I now yield to the ranking
member.
Mr. Critz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have a couple
more questions.
Mr. Ehrlich, in your testimony you talked about how you
have massive amounts of energy needed to irrigate your crops
and that your association is exploring solar power as an
alternative. Could you describe what you have been doing in
that or what the cooperative has been doing with that and are
we at the federal level supporting the efforts in any way?
Mr. Ehrlich. Yes. Well, we are in a coalition with several
other members, agricultural-type members like often with the
utility companies, trying to develop solar power. More of a
community-based economic development program, too, that would
allow us to use this solar power to irrigate, to run pumps and
motors and things like that. But one of our problems is to use
it as economic development we have to have more transmission
capacity. And so we have met some opposition with landowners of
where the line has to go in order to export power out.
Mr. Critz. Right.
Mr. Ehrlich. And so it is a difficult process because there
is a very wealthy landowner in that part of the valley and we
respect his private property rights, but he has been very
successful in using the regulatory process to slow down the
project. So I do not know what the outcome will be but that is
what we are involved with.
Mr. Critz. The landowner is not Ted Turner, is it?
Mr. Ehrlich. No.
Mr. Critz. I get the land report every month and I see he
is like the largest landowner in the country.
Mr. Ehrlich. He owns land very close to it.
Mr. Critz. Okay. See, I was not far off.
Mr. Pingel, the trucking industry is starting to increase
its use of alternative fuels such as natural gas, ethanol, and
biodiesel. How does that work for the independent trucker? I
mean, you are not--you mentioned and I know I have lots of
small family trucking firms all around my district and, you
know, when you are talking 3, 6, maybe 10 trucks, is it
economically feasible for the small transportation company to
move from strictly diesel to some sort of either mix or
completely natural gas engine?
Mr. Pingel. Well, some of the states like Minnesota, like I
said, being from Wisconsin, they mandated B5, a 5 percent
biofuel. And the problem that we ran into at that time was
during the winter because biofuel has a tendency to gel up
faster. So it is great during the summer. And as far as natural
gas, the problem with natural gas is the range on my truck
right now in miles per gallon is over 1,000 miles. You cannot
carry enough natural gas to go that far, and the range on most
of the natural gas trucks that I have seen is right around 300
miles. So you are stopping consistently more times.
Mr. Critz. Right. Right. And that is what I have seen as
well, is that there is a future but it is not just you flip a
switch and you get there.
Well, I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your
testimony. I really appreciate it and this is a great hearing
and, you know, from the articles the chairman showed, obviously
we are all thinking about gas prices right now. So thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Tipton. Thank you, Ranking Member Critz. And I
would like to thank all of our witnesses once again
fortestifying before the Subcommittee today. You highlighted many of
the negative impacts of surging gas prices on small businesses in the
United States and, more importantly, you have shown us here in Congress
that the best way to be able to reduce these heavy burdens is to engage
in an ``all-of-the-above'' approach to high gas prices.
The keystone of this strategy is American oil from American
soil. By allowing increased domestic drilling within our
borders and within our waters in the near term we can reduce
our significant dependence on foreign oil while enabling other
more cleaner, more sustainable fuels to be further explored and
better integrated into our society, such as natural gas and
biofuels.
The recommendations voiced today have not fallen on deaf
ears. We will take what we have learned today and inform our
colleagues as we move forward or enact or amend policies
affecting American small businesses.
I would ask for unanimous consent that members have five
legislative days to submit statements and supporting materials
for the record. Without objection, so ordered and this hearing
is now adjourned. Thank you.
[Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
