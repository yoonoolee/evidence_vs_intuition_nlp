SBA'S MANAGEMENT OF THE CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAMS

----------

WEDNESDAY, JUNE 6, 2012

House of Representatives,
Committee on Small Business,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 2:16 p.m., in Room
2360, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Sam Graves (Chairman
of the Committee) presiding.
Present: Representatives Graves, Chabot, Mulvaney, Tipton,
Landry, Herrera Beutler, West, Ellmers, Velazquez, Schrader,
Critz, Clarke, Cicilline, Richmond, and Owens.
Chairman Graves. I call the Committee to order, and today
we welcome back to the Committee SBA Administrator Karen Mills.
Thanks for being here, Administrator.
Administrator Mills is well aware of the Committee's
interests and role in making sure that SBA's financing programs
are not only serving the needs of small businesses, but that
they are also being managed in a way that safeguards taxpayer
dollars.
The Committee has held a variety of hearings that have
highlighted both the needs of small businesses in accessing
capital and the needs of lenders for clear and consistent
regulatory guidance. During a time of fragile economic
recovery, when we are looking to our small businesses to help
create growth and jobs, how to meet the financial needs of
these firms is of great importance.
In fiscal year 2013, the SBA requested a 67 percent
increase in subsidy to cover the costs of its financing
programs, while lowering the authorization level in the 7(a)
and 504 programs. As the SBA financing programs become more
expensive to operate, it is vital that we look for ways to
reduce costs to the taxpayers. This means making sure the SBA
is effectively managing its programs in a transparent manner,
reducing paperwork burdens, and conducting effective oversight
of lenders.
Today we are here to examine the procedures that SBA uses
to manage its financial assistance programs. We will also look
at how SBA undertakes its mission of overseeing its $90 billion
loan portfolio and controlling costs.
For the SBA lending programs to be effective, they must
control not only costs, but also control risk. We look forward
to learning more about how SBA sets policy for its financial
assistance programs; to find out what SBA is doing to be more
transparent to its lending partners and to the public; and how
SBA is managing risk to the taxpayers.
SBA must foster the partnership between agency and its
private-sector lending partners so that the SBA lending
programs can achieve their statutory mission of serving the
needs of small businesses. At the same time, we understand the
SBA needs to exercise robust and effective oversight of its
lending partners, who are often given a great deal of
discretion to obligate taxpayers on behalf of the SBA.
With that, I now yield to Ranking Member Velazquez for her
opening statement.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
For the past 2 years, our Nation's economy has experienced
steady private-sector job growth. The unemployment rate, which
peaked in October 2010 at 10 percent, has fallen by almost 2
percentage points. But these gains have not been enough to
overcome the high hurdle in unemployment. If there is any
takeaway from last week's disappointing job numbers, it is that
we still have a long road ahead of us with millions of
Americans who are seeking work that cannot find it.
This is why small businesses must remain front and center
to our recovery. They remain our single greatest source of new
jobs, but in order for entrepreneurs to play their traditional
job-creating role, it is essential that they have access-to-
capital. It is the fuel for innovation and economic expansion
across the spectrum of entrepreneurship.
However, small businesses face real challenges in the
capital markets. While lending conditions and credit standards
have improved significantly over the past year, companies'
balance sheets have not yet fully recovered. Recent economic
indicators also raise doubts as to whether the flow of
affordable credit will be sustained.
In past recoveries the Small Business Administration's
access-to-capital programs have been critical to providing
small firms with a stable source of credit. While the SBA had
some success in leveraging these programs during the worst of
the downturn, recent policies have steered some less-than-
favorable changes. Costs in the 7(a) and 544 loan programs are
escalating rapidly. Lending is stagnant, and small-dollar loans
to start-ups are on the decline.
During today's hearing I am hopeful that we will not just
tout past successes, but instead focus on what the agency is
doing to reverse these negative trends. These are real
problems, and no amount of window dressing or clever marketing
can make up for the growing gap in small business credit.
Getting loans in the hands of would-be entrepreneurs has never
been more important. Doing so is not just critical to reducing
unemployment, but growing our economy for the long term.
On that note I would like to thank Administrator Mills for
appearing before the Committee today. I am interested in
hearing your thoughts on how best to meet entrepreneurs'
capital needs so that they can continue to create new jobs.
With that, I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Graves. Thank you.
As I mentioned in my opening statement, our witness today
is the Honorable Karen Mills, Administrator of the SBA. Ms.
Mills has been the Administrator since 2009.
Welcome back to the Committee. We appreciate your coming
in.

STATEMENT OF KAREN MILLS, ADMINISTRATOR, UNITED STATES SMALL
BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION

Ms. Mills. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman
Graves, Ranking Member Velazquez, members of the Committee,
thank you for inviting me to testify on SBA's lender oversight
program. I have submitted my full written testimony to the
Committee, which I ask to be made part of the hearing record.
Our goal at the SBA is to ensure that small business owners
and entrepreneurs across the country have access to the capital
and help they need to grow their businesses and create jobs.
Today our lending is running at above 2008 levels following a
record year in 2011 in which we supported more than $30 billion
in lending to over 60,000 small businesses. In addition, our
small business investment companies also had a record year,
putting $2.6 billion directly into the hands of more than 1,300
high-growth businesses.
While commercial lending has improved, we know that gaps
remain. Small-dollar loans and loans in underserved communities
are still not back at the levels that we need them. To solve
this challenge, we are focused on what we call a More Doors,
More Dollars approach. This has allowed us to open up product
lines to qualified community development financial
institutions, and we have streamlined and simplified loan
processes to increase small-loan volumes. At the same time, we
are committed to aggressively protecting taxpayer dollars and
ensuring that our programs are cost-effective. As I have
testified before, we take a zero tolerance stance to fraud,
waste and abuse in all of our programs.
Over the past 3 years, we have engaged in extensive review
and redesign of SBA's lender oversight activities. At the core
of this effort has been increased collaboration with our Office
of Inspector General. One of the areas we identified early on
is the importance of a strong oversight culture that is made
possible through close coordination between the Office of
Inspector General, our Office of General Counsel and key
players across our loan programs. The results have been
tangible.
For example, we have worked together to close more than 80
inspector general recommendations in the last year alone. To
further increase the intensity of our oversight activities, we
are incorporating best practices from our sister agencies,
including FDIC, the Fed and the OCC, as well as private-sector
financial institutions. We also sought out and incorporated
feedback from SBA stakeholders, internal analysis, GAO reports,
and advice and recommendations from members of this Committee.
Today we are seeing the results of these efforts, including
more robust agency enforcement. Over the past 3 years, we have
declined to renew delegated lending authority over 300 times
for SBA lenders where the entities did not meet SBA's loan
standards, and we have suspended or debarred over 50 loan
officers, loan brokers, packagers and applicants in the 7(a)
program.
We have also increased the activity of our Lender Oversight
Committee, and we initiated a new Lender Supervision and
Enforcement Task Force with the aim of originating enhanced
supervision and enforcement actions. In addition, we are making
significant organizational changes within our Office of Credit
Risk Management, including the hiring of a new Director who
brings a wealth of experience monitoring lenders, large and
small.
In making these enhancements we have worked closely with
our lenders and our stakeholders to address their concerns. In
response to their input, we have simplified and updated our
rules for lenders and borrowers, streamlined provisions of our
loan programs, and are providing increased transparency in our
lender communications and requirements.
We believe that these ongoing efforts to ensure consistency
and clarity will further strengthen our ability to manage
agency risks. All of these changes and enhancements flow from
our three-pronged approach to manage risk, and I have mentioned
this before: providing greater focus on preventing fraud or
abuse before it happens; continual monitoring of loans in the
SBA portfolio; and strengthening our enforcement function by
punishing bad actors. This approach has been extremely
successful in our efforts to root out fraud, waste and abuse in
government contracting, and we are seeing similar results in
lender oversight.
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you
today. I look forward to working closely with this Committee to
build on the significant progress we have made, and I am happy
to take your questions.
Chairman Graves. Thank you, Administrator Mills.
We are going to start out with Mr. West.
Mr. West. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member. And,
Administrator Mills, it is great to see you again.
You know, that is one of the big things that I would like
to focus on is this idea of accountability and, you know, the
transparency and refining and streamlining of the processes,
but also the consequences thereof. You mentioned the 50 loan
officers, brokers and packagers that were suspended or debarred
in fiscal year 2009. Has that increased or decreased as we look
in the last fiscal year or so?
Ms. Mills. It has increased significantly.
Mr. West. Okay. And in the 347 lenders, when you look at
this preferred lending program, do we need to get tighter as
far as the criteria by which we are allowing people to be
preferred lenders? Is this a program that we want to continue
on if you have 347 that you had to--you know, did not renew
their preferred lending status?
Ms. Mills. We have, as I mentioned in the written remarks,
done an extensive overhaul on how we assess our lenders,
including looking at the criteria for their risk ratings, and
we are using different criteria, more expanded criteria,
including activity level, size of loan, actual changes in
lender behavior, which turned out to be very important
indicators, and on average we audit about 180 lenders per year.
So we are really revising our entire risk-base reviews.
Mr. West. And I guess the ``so what'' to it all is you
talked about punishment, consequences. Can you give us an idea
of the specific things that--the ramifications of not being
renewed or being debarred by the SBA? I mean, what really is
going to hold people's feet to the fire so that we do have the
access to capital that is necessary for our small businesses,
and we don't have bad actors, as you just talked about?
Ms. Mills. We have put together a real intensive focus on
both supervisory and enforcement actions. And we have a new
Lender Oversight Committee and what we call our Lending
Supervision and Enforcement Task Force, and they assess each of
the circumstances and go through the proper procedures and
figure out what the consequences are.
But I think the message is clear. We have a zero tolerance
policy for bad actors, and we are going to make sure there are
consequences.
Mr. West. Can we make sure that we can get that into the
Code of Federal Regulations if those standards, criteria,
whatever, are not there currently?
Ms. Mills. We work with those that are there currently, and
we now have great cooperation with our inspector general and
the Department of Justice as well.
Mr. West. I have to be fair in asking this. We didn't grow
the administration to have this new agency that you are talking
about. I mean, this was in-house or what?
Ms. Mills. We have reorganized in-house.
Mr. West. Then I am happy.
Thank, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Chairman Graves. Ms. Velazquez.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you.
Administrator Mills, in an interview you gave to The New
York Times in March, you stated that the gap in credit for
small-dollar loans and loans to underserved communities was
caused by the withdrawal of the big banks from the 7(a)
program. You also stated that major effort is now underway to
bring them back into the fold. Do you think this is a sound
strategy given that these negative trends were caused in large
part by an overreliance on a handful of large lenders to drive
lending?
Ms. Mills. Well, Ranking Member Velazquez, you are exactly
right that this issue was caused by the fact that we had only a
few large lenders making loans of the small-dollar variety, and
in the credit crunch, they went away from the market, and they
had been using consumer credit scores, and as a result they had
made a lot of loans that turned out not to be very good.
Ms. Velazquez. Do you recall in previous hearings where you
attended and you participated in that I raised the same issue?
Ms. Mills. Yes. And you have been very, very helpful and
consistent on this, and as a result we have been focused on a
number of solutions. As you mentioned----
Ms. Velazquez. What is the strategy?
Ms. Mills. There are three pieces to the strategy. We call
it, as I said, More Doors, More Dollars. So the first strategy
was in the community, whether you walk through the door of the
local community bank or the CDFI, we wanted to make sure you
had access to an SBA guarantee. We brought 1,000 banks from the
community bank sector back to SBA lending, and then we opened
the doors to selected community development financial
institutions that had good lending records to be able to make
7(a) loan guarantees. But that was not enough.
Ms. Velazquez. Isn't it true that most of those banks
basically make one loan or were attracted by increased
guarantee from the Recovery Act? Once that expires, they are
gone. So what is your agency doing to recruit new lenders and
support their lending efforts, particularly if they only make
one or two loans a year?
Ms. Mills. Once again, you are exactly right. The real bulk
of these loans come from the large lenders, but we could not
open up to the same procedure as we had before. So we have
changed our process to use a different methodology called the
Small Business Predictive Score, SBPS. It is a score used in
lieu of the consumer credit score. We have incorporated this
into our new processing of our Small Loan Advantage loans,
because large lenders and regional lenders were not making
small loans because it was too expensive for them. So we
understood their processing issues, reduced their costs, and
then instituted a more predictive score in order to make sure
that the loss rates would not skyrocket.
Ms. Velazquez. You know, in my opening statement I raised
the issue that this economy is still fragile, and that the last
report shows that the unemployment rate went up, and basically
the companies that will be creating those jobs are new start-
ups. And it is just like for 2 or 3 years now, since 2008, I
have been raising the same issue. And since the JOBS Act
increased the maximum SBA loan to $5 million, the percentage of
smaller loans, defined as those of $150,000 or less, declined
from 17 percent of total lending dollars in 2009 to just 8
percent.
So the jobs that we need to create, those companies and
those start-ups are not getting the credit that they need, and
I don't see that just by creating a new pilot program or a new
program, lending program, that is going to reduce paperwork--
SBA Express Preferred Lending Program, all of them reduced
paperwork.
Ms. Mills. We have launched a Small Loan Advantage Program
June 1 with new procedures, and on day one we had 45 loans in
the queue. This is a highly exciting product, a process
improvement for our lending community. So we believe that this
will be a very important augmentation for the problems that you
just described, and we are going to continue to work on the
start-up problem which you mentioned, which is also very, very
important.
Ms. Velazquez. Last year the Women's Procurement Program
was finally put into place, and agencies began awarding
contracts under this program in the second half of fiscal year
2011. However, contracting officers have not been really using
this program. In the current fiscal year, there have been 143
actions worth $3.6 million.
So I would just like to ask you, since we passed this
legislation, we went to court, U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce
went to court, the new administration promised it will have it
up and running, and it has taken this long, my question to you
is can you outline the steps that SBA and you specifically are
going to take to educate contracting officers of their ability
to set aside to women-owned small businesses?
Ms. Mills. Well, I am happy to get back to you with a list
of specific events and activities. We have a continuous
program, and I personally am very committed to our women's
contracting role.
As you know, this was passed by Congress in the year 2000,
and we took it up and went through the entire process of
getting it up and running. And we have I believe it is close--I
am going to get you the exact number, but I think it is 8,000
women who have self-registered in our contracting registry, and
we now are active every day with every agency, because we have
goals, and we are holding our agencies accountable for meeting
those goals.
Ms. Velazquez. Well, numbers speak volumes. $3.6 million
have gone to women contracting awards. So all I can say is that
women-owned businesses have been waiting for 10 long years, and
they deserve better. Thank you.
Chairman Graves. Mr. Mulvaney.
Mr. Mulvaney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Administrator Mills, thank you for coming today. I applaud
your efforts regarding the smaller loans. It is something that
we have seen both in this hearing room, but also as we have
traveled the country. I know that Ms. Chu and I went out to her
district and heard exactly this, that small businesses were
having difficulty getting access to the smaller loans, and the
numbers that you heard the ranking member mention about the
size of those 150,000-or-less loans dropping from, I think, 17
percent to 8 percent is exactly what we are seeing in the real
world. So again, on that front, I applaud you.
I guess my question is this: Other than you talked about
bringing in some more community banks, which I think is a
tremendous idea, because, again, we saw the same thing which
you have just described, which is that fewer and fewer banks
are actually doing this. You get to a bigger bank, the small
loans don't make any money for them, so we have to figure out a
way to fix this.
Beyond reaching out on this More Doors, More Dollars
program, how are you actually physically changing the process?
Give me specific examples of how you are making it easier for
my local Camden community bank to make a $50,000 SBA loan?
Ms. Mills. Well, we would be very happy to sort of walk you
through the actual changes. We have reengineered our entire
Small Loan Advantage, and this is what launched. Small Loan
Advantage is actually a processing option for lenders, and it
is under our 7(a) program, but it is designed to solve the
problem that lenders have, which is making small loans wasn't
affordable. They weren't making any loans because they weren't
making any money making those loans. So we have recently
implemented further streamlining, and the use of the Small
Business Predictive Scores is a very important component of
that, because it reduces the time to make the loan, and it has
been proven much more predictive of success than consumer
credit scores.
Mr. Mulvaney. I understand the change on that, but if I am
a banker, and I used to do loan closings, I dealt with bankers
all the time, and if I am a banker, one of the things I am
interested in is the number of forms I have to fill out and the
number of documents that I have to process.
Ms. Mills. Well, we are happy to take you through them.
They are much reduced. They are much more automated.
Mr. Mulvaney. Do you think it is more accessible now to
community banks than it was a year ago?
Ms. Mills. Absolutely. We have changed this format so that
it is open to all lenders, not just our preferred lenders, and
we have a streamlined option. Lenders have the option of using
their own notes, for instance, instead of using SBA notes, so
that reduces the amount of paperwork.
Mr. Mulvaney. Is what you just described part and parcel of
that program that went in on June 1st, or is that a different
program?
Ms. Mills. No, this is part of that June 1st revision.
Mr. Mulvaney. Well, good. I encourage you to continue to do
that, because, like I said, what we have seen in the real world
is that for small businesses, these things have dried up.
I have got a couple very quick questions to follow up on
what Colonel West had asked about, which is the 50 loan
officers, brokers, packagers that were suspended or disbarred;
the 347 lenders that you took off of--you did not renew their
preferred status. I recognize that that is 400 different
circumstances, but do you see any general trends in the reasons
why you are taking those actions? What are you seeing out in
the field amongst the loan officers, for example? Are there
general things that are happening that says, wait a second,
this is one of the things we need to--reasons to get rid of
these folks?
Ms. Mills. Well, that is a very good question, and I think
once again I would like to get back with you on the details.
But we know now that we have a whole series of indicators, and
we are incorporating those learnings. We know, for instance,
lender behavior is a very important indicator. When loans start
to go up very, very fast, it is an important time to look at a
lender and dig deeper and perhaps do a more risk-based audit.
So we are using those criteria, and we can show you what they
are.
Mr. Mulvaney. Great. Thank you.
And then finally, last question on the budget, and I
apologize for being the budget person. The budget this year did
not request an extension of the commercial refinancing program
in 504. Why was that?
Ms. Mills. Well, the commercial refinancing program in 504
has, in fact, been quite a successful program in the last year,
and it has allowed small businesses to refinance mortgages and
use some of that capital as working capital, which has allowed
them to grow and create some jobs. It does expire at the end.
It is not authorized to go forward. But I will point out that
it has picked up steam, and there is a lot of people out there
who like it.
Mr. Mulvaney. I yield back the balance. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
Chairman Graves. Mr. Schrader.
Mr. Schrader. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Well, it was a popular program. Why is it not being
requested to be reauthorized, though? I guess that is the
question, following up on the Representative's point, because
it is tough for small businesses to get access except through
that creative program you developed.
Ms. Mills. Right. Well, this is a very good question, and
it is something that has come up before Congress in a number of
ways and a number of times and has not yet been reauthorized.
Mr. Schrader. So you wouldn't be adverse to us suggesting
it be reauthorized, I guess is where we are going with that.
Ms. Mills. It certainly has a lot of success right now in
the marketplace.
Mr. Schrader. I want to congratulate you on some of the
great work on the delinquency stuff. Since the new sheriff, if
I may refer to you that way, is in town, the delinquency rates
for 504 and 7(a) have gone down very dramatically, and it looks
like the attention on getting good-quality loans out there is
being met. So I appreciate that access.
How about what is the situation for capital? At the end of
each cycle, it seems like SBA, even Rural Development, for that
matter, the capital gets drawn up quickly and inability to make
loans because of insufficient capital. Where are we right with
SBA in terms of capital so that you can make the loans you want
to make?
Ms. Mills. We have room in our authorization to make all
the loans, large, small, medium-sized, that we need to make.
Mr. Schrader. Good, good, good.
And then historically we have had problems with our HUBZone
programs and some of our veterans programs where certain
unscrupulous people take advantage of them, and you, I know,
have had your attention on them. Can you comment a little bit
as of recently here, this month, how we are doing in terms of
curbing some of the ne'er-do-wells and their taking advantage
of programs they shouldn't have access to?
Ms. Mills. Well, as I said, we have a zero tolerance policy
for fraud, waste and abuse, and we began our effort with our
government contracting programs and with particular regard to
HUBZone. We have three pieces of that, which is up-front
certification, ongoing monitoring, and going after bad actors.
In HUBZone in particular we completely redid the up-front
certification and now have a streamlined, effective process for
HUBZone certification. So we are working very hard. We are
always improving processes. But that major hurdle that we have
has been successfully moved forward.
Mr. Schrader. We haven't had a GAO report since then, I
guess, to establish how well it is doing, I guess, at this
point in time, but you feel confident you would survive much
better than we have in the past an a result of the changes you
made?
Ms. Mills. Yes. We take an ongoing look, and we do not take
our eye off the ball on those government contracting problems.
Mr. Schrader. One of the other issues that comes up a lot,
and I don't know how much control you have over it, is that
with some of the minority women contracting issues, some of
these firms develop to become firms to take advantage of that
program, and the real small businessmen and women don't
actually get these contracts at the end of the day. They go out
to larger firms that purport to subcontract this out. A lot of
times it is out of State, small businesses. Is that something
the agency is focused on at all?
Ms. Mills. We are absolutely focused on making sure that
the program benefits go to those who are qualified to receive
it and for whom it is intended.
Mr. Schrader. Excellent. Excellent. Good. Good.
And then again following up on some of the questions that
have been asked, does SBA have particular improvements in some
of the timelines you alluded to, you know, timelines as far as
getting a loan application to resolution; the difficulty
sometimes of getting these loans, the paperwork notices we
heard over the last 2 or 3 years? Are you tracking that sort of
data, getting it done quicker, better?
Ms. Mills. Yes. We absolutely track our turnaround times,
and they range in the 10- to 20-day turnarounds. And we have
made significant improvements over time, and we have a
dashboard where we know where it is weekly.
Mr. Schrader. That is an improvement. What was it when you
came in, if I may ask?
Ms. Mills. Oh, it was significantly longer.
Mr. Schrader. That data would be good. I think you should
use that data to talk about some of the turnarounds that have
occurred since you have taken office.
I appreciate your attention on all the--you know, quite
frankly, the agency had been, in my opinion, in some disarray
and not well funded, not well appreciated, and as has been
pointed out, there is still a big lack of capital for really
smaller businesses.
So I hope--one question on that I guess, I have got time.
You are doing well, I am doing well. What about rural lending?
That is another issue that we are concerned about. It seems to
have fallen off a tad, and obviously I want to make sure that
rural America responds, too.
Ms. Mills. I was just in West Virginia. Next week is our
first anniversary of some of the things we announced for rural
America. We are very focused on making sure that we have an
inclusive strategy for entrepreneurs all across the country;
that it is not just on two coasts, even though we like the
coasts, because we see there are tremendous innovative
entrepreneurs, even very technical entrepreneurs, in all kinds
of rural areas, and they don't have as much access and
opportunity.
So we have cultivated regional banks, community banks,
credit unions and other lenders to make sure that they are
using these new products, and we are also focused on it in our
SBIC, where we did special focus on rural small business
investment companies.
Mr. Schrader. Thank you very much. I yield back.
Chairman Graves. Ms. Herrera Beutler.
Ms. Herrera Beutler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I actually only have--you know, I have taken in everything
that is being talked about, and I have a couple questions that
are a little bit more specific, and I was hoping to get your
comments on them. Obviously you can't speak to a specific case,
but I wanted to share kind of some feedback with you.
I had a printer in the largest county in my district who
was working with a lender to apply for a SBA loan, and he
said--this was at a town meeting. He raised his hand and said,
it is very frustrating and time consuming, so obviously we
wanted to know a little bit more about it.
So this is what happened. The local bank took the
application and then came back to him and said that the SBA
asked for more documentation, which he provided. He jumped
through those hoops. In the meantime, the bank gave him a line
of credit while they were kind of going through this process,
and which obviously later termed out at a very high interest
rate. He later found out that the bank never presented his
application to the SBA. And I was very, very curious about how
much leeway these banks get in picking and choosing what loan
applications they pass on to the SBA and what you are doing to
improve oversight in instances like this, where someone thinks
they are in good faith doing--and the printer is still
operating today. It is not like it was some fly-by-night
operation, right? It was a good-standing business in the
community and still is.
Is this common to hear something like this?
Ms. Mills. Well, first of all, I appreciate your having
brought this to our attention. You know, it is what we do every
day to follow up on small businesses that need access and
opportunity, whether it is to loans, or contract, or counseling
or other help. So we are always happy to have our people go see
what we can do to help them.
In this particular case, to answer your general question,
we have a public-private partnership between the Federal
Government and banks, and that makes for a very cost-effective
program. So banks are supposed to make all the loans that they
can without the SBA's help, because if the market will provide
credit, then why should the taxpayer subsidize that?
But there are lots of instances, as we know, that small
businesses don't meet the credit standard, but they are still
good, and the bank would like to make the loan, they just need
a little help. That is where they come to the SBA for an SBA
guarantee. So it would need to meet the criteria that the bank
could not make this without the SBA's help.
If the bank--the other thing I would say to your small
business is when you are preparing for a loan, you should come
to one of our SBA small business development centers and get a
mentor and a counselor to help you work through your business
plan and your bank package. It tends to make for a more
creditworthy conversation when you get to the bank, and they
can help direct you to a bank that is interested in that
particular industry.
Ms. Herrera Beutler. Well, and that makes sense. However,
if you are using the bank or banks as your partners, and they
are kind of an entry point, so to speak--and I get it, you
know, if you can make a loan in the private sector, go for it,
right? That is mostly what we want. But this is during the
credit crunch when small business lending, SBA was really the
only game in town. So here this borrower thought he was dealing
with the SBA and jumped through the hoops to comply with what
he thought was SBA paperwork. It seems somewhat disingenuous
for a lender to then say, yes, yes, we are hoping to get there,
hoping to get there, and you will just do the loan through us,
and it is a high interest rate, and SBA isn't involved.
Is there some sort of a regulatory guidance? I mean, I
understand that you guys are overseeing the loans that you have
made, but at what point is someone paying attention to the
partners and making sure the partners are following SBA policy?
Does that make sense?
Ms. Mills. Well, we pay tremendous attention to the
partners and make sure they follow SBA policy. And the banks in
this situation, we would be happy to follow up with you
further, but I want to assure you that there are strict SBA
policies, and one of which is that they need to make a
determination that it is a credit--it is an SBA situation.
Ms. Herrera Beutler. So do they let the potential
perspective borrower know at some point, yeah, you came here
for a SBA loan, you are filling out SBA paperwork, but this is
going to be a conventional loan through a bank? I mean, is
there any kind of a requirement that they up front say, okay,
you are not going--it is not going to be SBA credit, we are
going to kind of walk you through this process?
Ms. Mills. I would be happy to get back to you with the
specifics on the guidelines on that specific communication. We
can get back to you.
Ms. Herrera Beutler. Well, not only just this case though.
I mean, in general do they have to at some point say, hey, you
are dealing with us, the bank, not us, the SBA partner? Do you
require that?
Ms. Mills. I am happy to go through the specific guidelines
to answer that question, but in general, yes, the bank does
say, this is a loan from us; or the bank says, this is a loan
from SBA. And the paperwork would reflect it is a loan from the
bank or a loan from the SBA.
Ms. Herrera Beutler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Graves. Mr. Owens.
Mr. Owens. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for coming to testify today, Administrator Mills.
We have had a lot of conversation and questions about
credit availability, and you just described in response to a
question the fact that primarily you want the banks to do the
lending; secondarily, you want a form of guarantee program;
thirdly, you would have a direct loan from the SBA. Would that
be a fair ranking of those?
Ms. Mills. No, sir. Let me clarify.
First, the marketplace provides 90 percent of the lending
to small business. The role of the government guarantee is to
provide additional access and opportunity when the bank won't
make that loan. We do not have a direct lending program except
in our disaster loan operations.
Mr. Owens. Okay. Now, there does come a point, and we did
hit that in 2008 through 2010, where the SBA has to make a
decision about a guarantee as to the creditworthiness of the
borrower, and in many instances what occurred during that
period was that creditworthiness would not meet your standards,
and therefore the guarantee was not issued. Would that be a
fair statement?
Ms. Mills. Well, we have a process where a bank will make a
decision about whether they want to make a loan or whether they
want to make a loan with an SBA guarantee. In certain cases
that authority is delegated to lenders to make that decision,
and in other cases where we have not granted delegated
authority, it comes to our processing centers for credit
review.
Mr. Owens. And there are times, obviously, when you make a
determination that the borrower is not creditworthy.
Ms. Mills. That would be correct.
Mr. Owens. And that accounts for some of the declinations
in the loan process; in other words, they were declined a loan
because they were not creditworthy?
Ms. Mills. Correct.
Mr. Owens. You also talked a little bit about this
predictive score, and I would like to hear a little bit more
about that, exactly how you operate it and what the source of
that analytic is.
Ms. Mills. So the Small Business Predictive Score has been
around a long time. It is used throughout industry, and, in
fact, we have had it for quite a bit of time analyzing our
portfolio. But on the front end of the portfolio, the standard
had been for many banks in 2005, 2006, 2007 to use consumer
credit scores as a cutoff. We have a lot of legacy defaults
from our 2005, 2006, 2007 portfolio. In fact, that is a
substantial part of our subsidy cost.
When we looked going forward, we have begun to make a new
analysis of our credit thresholds as part of this entire look
at credit risk management, and what we have found through
extensive analysis is that this commercially available, widely
used industry standard product, the Small Business Predictive
Score, is a much better predictor than the consumer credit
score. So we have now begun to incorporate it even more
significantly in the front end of the credit process.
Mr. Owens. And that analytic you indicated is an industry
standard. I am assuming you mean the commercial lending
industry?
Ms. Mills. Correct.
Mr. Owens. So you are taking something from the private
sector and incorporating it into your analytics in making your
decisions?
Ms. Mills. Right. But this is something that we have had
access to and is part of our system, and we have been using it
more on the back end than on the front end.
Mr. Owens. Thank you. I have no further questions.
Chairman Graves. Mr. Landry.
Mr. Landry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Administrator Mills, I wanted to ask you a question about a
correspondence that I sent to you back in October of last year
concerning HUBZones, and it is just a kind of basic question,
because I sent the letter to you all, and the response I got
did really not suffice. It didn't answer the question.
Could you tell me what the current status of the HUBZone
program following that recalibration is? I mean, I had three
parishes or counties in the district that were removed from the
HUBZone, but the calibration was being done at a time when the
Deepwater Horizon incident was affecting our economy. And my
question to you all, which has not been answered, is whether or
not the economic--if you all used the economic data or looked
towards the effects of the government-imposed moratorium on my
district, and specifically those comments, because they are on
the gulf, if that impact was used when recalibrating their
position?
Ms. Mills. Well, number one, I want to tell you straight
out that we will go back and take your original letter and any
additional thoughts or questions or clarifications that you
would like and spend the time to make sure that you have a full
answer.
Mr. Landry. Thank you.
Ms. Mills. We want to make sure that we spend that time and
have you be satisfied with the response.
The HUBZone program is right now designated by census data
as to what is a HUBZone, and we had some new data, so we have
new HUBZones and new maps. And we want to make sure--we will
follow up with you after this meeting to make sure that we
understand specifically how that affected your counties that
you mentioned.
Mr. Landry. Right. And that is the only question that was
left unanswered was just the fact that when you took the census
data prior to the Deepwater Horizon incident, we were
experiencing an economic upturn; however, the administration
created an economic downturn due to the moratorium. So I just
thought that it would be fair to calculate that amount in
there, and I just would ask that you all take a look at that to
see if there is anything we could do to determine whether or
not that data would put them back into the HUBZone status.
Ms. Mills. Yes. We would be happy to.
Mr. Landry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Chairman Graves. Mr. Critz.
Mr. Critz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thanks, Administrator Mills, for being here. It is good to
see you again, and our walk through Vandergrift was very nice.
We got a lot of good feedback from that.
My first question is I had a field hearing in Pittsburgh
earlier in the year in April, and it was about small businesses
engaging in international trade, and many of them discussed the
critical role that credit and capital play for companies
operating in foreign markets, but they don't know that the SBA
is a viable option.
My concern is that district offices are cut to the bone,
and I am wondering how the agency can better market itself so
that exporters are made aware of SBA's trade financing
programs. And what brought this to light is that I guess in the
past year, nearly three times as many export loans have been
made by the Ex-Im Bank than through SBA to small businesses. So
I am curious why the SBA is lagging behind, and what do we need
to do to market it?
Ms. Mills. Well, first of all, you are exactly right that
there is tremendous opportunity in export. And I am happy to
get you the exact statistics on it, but I assure you there has
been tremendous growth in the SBA export loan program this
year, actually record growth, and also in our export
counseling.
But I want to point you to our STEP grants, which are the
vehicle that we have been given by Congress to get even more
impact in a State-by-State basis. This is $30 million a year,
funded for 2 years, to give competitive grants to State export
offices to work explicitly on small business exporting. And
this ensures that our district offices, the State offices and
any other players are acting in a coordinated fashion on the
ground so that we make the best use of the buck.
Mr. Critz. Well, good. Good. Thank you.
The second question is just over a year ago, SBA
implemented a Small Loan Advantage pilot program, which
delegated authority to current SBA lenders to make loans based
on basically the two-page application. In the past, efforts to
reduce paperwork and delegate authority have led to dramatic
increases in default rates. What safeguards are in place to
ensure that this new effort does not facilitate poor
underwriting decisions or ultimately increase the cost of the
7(a) program?
Ms. Mills. As I was mentioning earlier, the Small Loan
Advantage 2.0 is a processing option for lenders under our 7(a)
program, and it has been recently improved and streamlined
further and opened to nondelegated lenders. And that went into
effect June 1 with very strong response from the lenders. The
safeguard that you described is the use of the Small Business
Predictive Index at the front end of that new processing.
Mr. Critz. Okay. Thank you.
Well, the Committee is well aware of the economic slowdown
or what the impact of the economic slowdown had on SBA's
lending portfolio, and we worked hard to provide SBA tools to
bring lending volume back to preslowdown levels. I also think
it is important that you have to walk that line between
providing small businesses capital while protecting the
taxpayers' money.
Can you tell us the current state of that portfolio, and
can you describe also the creditworthiness of SBA's lending
portfolio?
Ms. Mills. Yes. If you look at my written testimony, on
page 5 there are two graphs that describe the state of the
current portfolio. In terms of delinquencies and purchase
rates, they peaked in the final quarter of fiscal year 2010,
and they have been steadily declining since, and they are at
about the prerecession levels at the moment.
The second graph is the Small Business Predictive Scores
over time, which is an indicator of the creditworthiness of the
portfolio, which, as you can see, is improving.
Mr. Critz. Well, very good. Thank you very much. I yield
back.
Chairman Graves. I have a question that is kind of outside,
I guess, the SBA's portfolio. But we are hearing from banks,
from a lot of banks, that they are having a hard time lending
to small businesses because of the scrutiny by the regulators
when it comes to small business loans.
Just out of curiosity, in your position on the Cabinet, can
you use that? Because we can't seem to have any influence
whatsoever over the regulators, and they don't want to hear
from us, and it doesn't make any difference anyway. I mean,
advocating for small business certainly, advocating for--you
know, we have got to use a little bit of common sense here, and
that scrutiny is really having some issues out there. At least
the banks are telling us that. So can you use that position to
push the Fed along a little?
Ms. Mills. Thank you, Congressman Graves.
We have seen exactly the same concern, and I have, in fact,
had conversations with regulators on a consistent basis,
because it is a real issue if the guidelines that are given out
by the regulators are not interpreted in a clear and precise
way all the way down into the regions, and that creates
uncertainty at the banks as to how a loan would be classified,
and that makes them not willing to make the loan. And this is a
matter, as you describe, of constant concern, and I take it as
part of my job to continually have this conversation with the
regulators.
Chairman Graves. That is good, because advocacy is
obviously one of the--is an important part. It is outside your
portfolio, but it is obviously very important.
Mr. Richmond.
Mr. Richmond. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member,
and thank you, Administrator Mills, for coming in.
I guess I will start where the chairman just left off. It
just so happens I was visited by some of my constituents today
who we normally don't view as small business owners. But I had
a meeting with my homebuilders, and they were talking about the
crunch that they have accessing capital in order to build
homes. And one of the things they mentioned was that before the
regulations and some other things, that if they had a signed
purchase agreement from a person, the person was already
prequalified for the mortgage, that they could take that and
almost use that as security to get a loan. And they said in
those instances they didn't have--to their knowledge in the
room, and I guess there was about 15 to 20 homebuilders--that
in their recollection they could only remember one or two that
didn't go right.
So I told them that I would pose that question to you: Is
there something that the SBA can do specifically for
homebuilders, or if there are any programs that you know of
right now that they qualify for that they may not be paying
attention to?
Ms. Mills. Well, my father-in-law was a homebuilder, and I
know exactly the situation that you are describing. What we
will do is come back to you with a specific thought and
recommendation on which SBA loan program or activity or banking
relationship might be the most appropriate to pursue.
Mr. Richmond. This question shifts away, but it goes back
more to the New Markets Tax Credit Program and our CDFIs,
which, in my opinion, are working very well, especially in our
inner cities and low-income communities. And I guess this
question would be whether there is a way or if you have someone
looking at ways to facilitate the 7(a) lending program with the
CDFI program for low-income communities. That way they can
benefit both from the tax credit and the 7(a) program.
Ms. Mills. Well, thank you, Congressman.
As you know, over a year ago we implemented a program
called Community Advantage, which allows selected CDFIs which
have a good track record in managing loans to have access to
the 7(a) loan guarantees. So that would be the primary vehicle
that we use to engage CDFIs, which we think are really
important new partners for us.
Mr. Richmond. One of the ideas that came from someone in my
district was that if you all contemplated allowing CDEs to
participate in the Community Express loans, and that way the
CDFIs would be able to attract more small businesses investing
into the New Markets Tax Credit Program.
Ms. Mills. I would be happy to get back to you on that.
Mr. Richmond. Okay.
Administrator Mills, I don't have any specific additional
questions for you. Do you have anything that--I will give you
my last minute and a half if there is something that you just
want to volunteer something that came up that you want to
address.
Ms. Mills. Thank you, Congressman.
Mr. Richmond. With that I will yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
Chairman Graves. Mr. Cicilline.
Mr. Cicilline. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member,
and welcome, Administrator Mills. It is good to have you back
before the Committee, and thank you for your visit to my home
State. The small businesses in Rhode Island enjoyed having you
there, and it was a great opportunity to talk about the work of
the SBA, and I thank you for doing that.
What I wanted to ask you about briefly is the SBIR program,
which my State has had considerable success with. In
preparation for this hearing, I reached out to the individuals
in my regional SBA office, as well as folks in the knowledge
economy that is growing in Rhode Island in the research and
development community. And what I heard from so many of them
was that this program is successful, it is vital, it has led to
a lot of innovative companies conducting business in our State,
but that we just don't have enough participation.
And one of the things that I proposed during our
reauthorization was the FAST program, really which I think was
the successful way to do outreach to encourage participation in
the SBIR program by providing grants to organizations that do
that. And I know we didn't include it in the authorization, and
I am wondering sort of what strategies that you are developing
to really broaden the reach of SBIR, which is such a good model
and such a successful program.
But while I am very proud we have had more than 290 awards
and more than $100 million in grant funding in Rhode Island,
which has been great under the SBIR and STTR, I think there are
39 States ahead of us, so it seems to me there is a lot of
untapped opportunity. But without the FAST program, are there
other ways that you are thinking about or that we can support
broader outreach for this program?
Ms. Mills. Well, first of all, I want to thank this
Committee and Congress for the reauthorization of SBIR and STTR
and for your commitment to it. We are working very hard on
SBIR, and one of the things that I want to point out is that we
have consolidated all SBIR solicitations, which used to be on
11 different agency Websites, into 1 Website, SBIR.gov, and
educating all of our various arms and counselors and partners
to make sure that they mention and inform people about SBIR so
that we have a broader network.
With regard to FAST, my understanding is that although it
was not extended the reauthorization package, Congress could
extend it through appropriations as they have done in past
years.
Mr. Cicilline. And I take it you would recommend that we do
that?
Ms. Mills. Well, as I said, it is a very--the SBIR is a
very important program. We are working very hard to make sure
that in every aspect of Small Business Development Centers and
our counselors, district offices and advisers that we
incorporate knowledge about SBIR in our conversations with
small businesses.
Mr. Cicilline. Thank you. And I just have one other area.
You said this in the beginning of your testimony. I arrived a
little bit late, and I apologize, and I am happy to get some
information after the hearing. But would you just talk a little
bit about the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business
program and the status of that? This is an issue of
considerable concern, I know, to many Members of Congress in
ensuring that we are doing everything we can for service-
disabled veterans, and this program obviously is designed
specifically for that.
Ms. Mills. Yes. We have a number of programs for service-
disabled veterans, including our contracting program which you
are referring to. But we also have some really extraordinary
counseling, advice and veterans entrepreneurship education
programs, some of which are particular to service-disabled
veterans. So those are critical as well, and we can make sure
you have more information on those.
Mr. Cicilline. Thank you.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Graves. Ms. Clarke.
Ms. Clarke. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I thank you,
Ranking Member. And I join my colleagues in welcoming
Administrator Mills back to our Committee.
Administrator Mills, while I understand the concerns of my
colleagues, I echo a lot of what has been said here today. I
would like to switch gears slightly.
As we have discussed previously, MWBE small businesses face
an uphill climb in the best of times. While our economy is
still recovering, and we all understand that events outside of
the United States' control, including the cooling of emerging
economies, the eurozone crisis, which are currently
contributing factors, the most recent economic data is anything
but encouraging.
That being said, if we find ourselves in a situation where
capital access finds itself even more constrained than it is
currently, what is the SBA prepared to do with regards to
perhaps a greater need amongst the small business community and
especially within the minority small business community?
Ms. Mills. Well, Congresswoman, we have had a lot of this
conversation, because you, like many members of this Committee,
have been concerned about this for some time. And, as you know,
we share this concern, because although lending overall came
back strong to the SBA, it did not come back strongly for
small-dollar loans in underserved communities.
So 2 years ago now, we began a series of activities that,
as I mentioned, we call More Doors, More Dollars, and they
include the bringing in of CDFIs, the bringing in of faith-
based institutions. And they include something else, which is
an outreach program we did called the White House Urban
Economic Forums. And my colleague and deputy, Marie Johns, and
I have been--she has been particularly active traveling the
country and in many, many cities dealing with over 2,500 in-
person participants, 800 mentoring relationships facilitated,
23,000 on-line viewers, directly trying to reach and access
this women- and minority-owned business community so that we
can find a way to connect them to what they need, which can be
contracts, it can be loans, it can be help and advice, so that
they can grow their businesses.
We have an inclusive view of entrepreneurship, and we need
to be working to make sure all our entrepreneurs have access
and opportunity.
Ms. Clarke. Well, let me ask a second question of you. We
have discussed the fact that some SBA programs haven't lived up
to their charter, and while I applaud the SBA's willingness to
address the shortcomings of certain programs, what processes
are the--is SBA putting in place to ensure that future newly
configured programs are living up to their charters and don't
require the overhaul that Community Express did, for instance?
Ms. Mills. Well, we are very actively monitoring and
assessing and working on continuous improvement of all of our
programs.
Ms. Clarke. Well, I would have no doubt that you will keep
your finger on the pulse of these new ventures.
I want to also echo the sentiments of Congressman Schrader
about the HUBZones and the usage of women- and minority-owned
businesses to get the contracts, and then the discarding of
those companies when the contracts are awarded. That seems to
be a very hard nut to crack on many levels, but I hope that
vigilance is used to address this.
And perhaps there needs to be some examples made of some of
these companies that have been doing this so that, you know, in
the future others won't see this as a means of accessing the
contracting opportunities that are supposed to be partnerships,
quite frankly. And I think that this could be a gateway for
more employment in communities that are having a hard time
coming back, because now you are, you know, opening up the
landscape a little bit more for opportunities that didn't exist
previously.
Ms. Mills. Well, let me repeat that on HUBZone, and really
on all of our contracting and lending operations, we have
intensified our supervisory and our enforcement activities, and
we have a zero tolerance policy for bad actors.
Ms. Clarke. Very well. Thank you.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Graves. Ms. Velazquez.
Ms. Velazquez. I don't have further questions.
Chairman Graves. Before we finish up, I want to echo Mr.
Schrader's concerns with the rural loans or the decrease in
rural loans and the outreach there, and would push for a little
bit of outreach out there, because they are just as important
in the rural areas as anywhere.
But I would like to again thank you for coming in today and
for being here to discuss, obviously, this very important issue
of capital access for small businesses. We know on this
Committee that they are going to lead us out of the economic
downturn and into the economic recovery, and we want to
continue, obviously, to be very vigilant in overseeing the
programs that you administrate.
With that, I would ask unanimous consent that Members have
5 legislative days to submit statements and supporting
materials for the record. Without objection, so ordered.
[The information follows:]
Chairman Graves. With that, the hearing is adjourned.
Thanks again.
[Whereupon, at 3:22 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
