MARKUP OF THE SEMIANNUAL REPORT ON THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMMITTEE ON
SMALL BUSINESS

----------

THURSDAY, JUNE 23, 2011

House of Representatives,
Committee on Small Business,
Washington, DC.
The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 2:00 p.m., in
Room 2360, Rayburn House Office Building. Hon. Sam Graves
[chairman of the Committee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Graves, West, and Velazquez.
Chairman Graves. Good afternoon. We will call the meeting
to order for the Semiannual Report on the Activity of the Small
Business Committee. Pursuant to House Rules, each standing
committee must submit a Semiannual Report on the activities of
that committee, including separate sections summarizing its
legislative and oversight activities.
Before us today is our Semiannual Report, and this report
includes a copy of the Committee's rules and oversight plan
which passed by voice vote on January 26, 2011. It includes a
list of the Committee's membership and how the Committee is
organized in a summary of its legislative and oversight
activities.
As of June 14th, the Small Business Committee has conducted
10 full Committee hearings, seven Subcommittee meetings on
issues such as repealing the troublesome 1099 reporting
requirement in the Health Care bill, identifying federal
regulatory outreach, the effect of pending free trade
agreements on small exporters and two markups. We have had
hearings on the review of federal contracting laws, identifying
duplicative programs within the Small Business Administration,
studying the effects of high energy costs on small businesses,
and examining how a lack of capital is preventing small firms
from growing and creating jobs.
As you can see, the Committee has been very productive, and
I look forward to another active six months before our next
report. I now recognize the ranking member for her opening
remarks.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Chairman, for yielding.
Today's meeting will consider a report summarizing the
activities of the Small Business Committee for the first six
months of the 112th Congress. It outlines hearings,
legislation, oversight efforts, and steps taken to provide
regulatory relief to small firms. This Committee plays a key
role not only in passing measures to boost entrepreneurship but
also by heightening the profile of critical small business
issues. The legislative and hearing records play a key role in
shaping policies affecting access to capital, tax relief, and
economic development of small firms.
This is the first time that the Committee will issue a
Semiannual Report. It represents a change from previous
Congresses when committees were only required to file annually.
While I support additional transparency, today's markup strikes
me as largely symbolic. However, these reports do encourage
greater congressional oversight. I support it.
I recognize that the Chairman did not establish this new
reporting requirement and he believes, as I do, that small
businesses need action. The members of this Committee are
acutely aware of the challenges small businesses face today.
They have heard from witnesses throughout the year that getting
the economy on solid footing must be Congress's top priority.
It is my hope that the House can focus on a jobs package that
helps small businesses grow. A common refrain is that small
businesses are an afterthought when it comes to legislative
priorities.
I know the Chairman shares my commitment to helping small
businesses create jobs and restore our nation's economy.
Today's markup will fulfill our obligation under House rules.
Over the next 18 months, I look forward to working with the
members of this Committee to fulfill our obligation to small
businesses by tackling the problems they face.
And with that I yield back.
Chairman Graves. Thank you very much. Thank you very much,
Ranking Member.
Does any other member wish to be heard or have a statement
on the Semiannual Report? Seeing none, the Committee now moves
to the consideration of the Semiannual Report. Will the clerk
please read the document?
The Clerk. Semiannual Report on the Activity of the
Committee on Small Business, First Session of the----
Chairman Graves. I would ask unanimous consent that the
activity report be considered as read and open for amendment in
its entirety except for those portions of this document which
have already been approved and voted on by the Committee.
Seeing no objections, does any member seek recognition for
the purpose of offering an amendment? All right.
Seeing none, the question is on adopting the Semiannual
Report. All those in favor say aye.
[Chorus of ayes.]
Chairman Graves. All those opposed, no.
It is the opinion of the chair that the ayes have it. The
Semiannual Report is adopted.
I would ask unanimous consent that the staff of the
Committee be authorized to correct section numbers,
punctuation, cross references, and any other technical or
conforming corrections necessary to articulate and reflect the
action of the Committee in the report.
And seeing no objections, the markup is adjourned. And with
that, Ranking Member, I have the Northland Chamber of Commerce
here. And they are visiting today and we have actually, as you
can see, we do not get to control our schedule very much so I
have to move here and there with the votes. So I apologize for
being late and I am going to speak to them.
Ms. Velazquez. Welcome to Washington, D.C. It is really
great to have real people here.
Chairman Graves. Thank you very much. The hearing is
adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 2:15 p.m., the Committee markup was
adjourned.]
