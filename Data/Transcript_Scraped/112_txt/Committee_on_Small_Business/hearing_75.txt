MARKUP OF SEMIANNUAL REPORT ON THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMMITTEE ON SMALL
BUSINESS

----------

Wednesday, June 27, 2012

House of Representatives,
Committee on Small Business,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 1:05 p.m., in Room
2360, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Sam Graves [Chairman
of the Committee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Graves, Chabot, Mulvaney, Tipton,
West, Ellmers, Hanna, Schilling, Hahn, and Owens.
Chairman Graves. The first order of business before the
Committee, before we commence with our regular hearing, is
consideration of the Semiannual Report on the Activity of the
Committee on Small Business which is required by the House
rules. The Committee now moves to the consideration of the
Semiannual Activity Report, and the clerk will please read the
document.
The Clerk. Semiannual Report on the Activity of the
Committee on Small Business, second session of the 112th
Congress.
Chairman Graves. Without objection, the activity report is
going to be considered as read and open for amendment in its
entirety except for those provisions of this document that have
already been approved on and voted on by the Committee.
[The Activity Report follows.]
Chairman Graves. Seeing no objections to that, so ordered.
And does any member seek recognition for the purpose of
offering an amendment?
Seeing none, the question is on adopting the Semiannual
Report.
All those in favor, say aye.
All those opposed, no.
It is the opinion of the chair that the ayes have it. The
Semiannual Report is adopted.
So without objection, the staff of the Committee is
authorized to correct section numbers, punctuation, cross
references, and to make other technical and conforming
corrections necessary to accurately reflect the action of the
Committee in this measure. And without any objection there, it
is so ordered. And with that, the markup is adjourned and we
will move on to the regular hearing.
[Whereupon, at 1:07 p.m., the committee proceeded to other
business.]
