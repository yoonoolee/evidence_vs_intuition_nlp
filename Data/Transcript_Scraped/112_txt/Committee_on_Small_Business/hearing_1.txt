ORGANIZATIONAL MEETING

WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 26, 2011

House of Representatives,
Committee on Small Business,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 1 p.m., in Room
2360, Rayburn House Office. Hon. Sam Graves [chairman of the
Committee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Graves, Bartlett, Chabot, Coffman,
Ellmers, Herrera Beutler, Fleischmann, Tipton, Walsh, West,
Velazquez, Schrader, Critz, Altmire, Chu, Cicilline, and
Peters.
Chairman Graves. We will go ahead and get started. I will
call the Small Business Committee organization meeting to
order. I want to welcome all the returning Members and new
Members of the Committee. I know they are excited to dive into
this Committee and get to work, which is exactly what we are
going to do.
In the essence of time because we have got a vote coming up
right away, I will introduce the eight new Republican Members.
We have got Congresswoman Renee Ellmers, who was a nurse from
North Carolina before her election. Congresswoman Jaime Herrera
Beutler, who is returning to Washington, D.C., after having
once been an aide to Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers and
represents the 3rd District of Washington. Congressman Chuck
Fleischmann practiced law in Tennessee prior to his election.
Congressman Jeff Landry successfully ran for office from
Louisiana while operating a small oil services business.
Congressman Mick Mulvaney, also an attorney, served in the
South Carolina State Legislature. Congressman Scott Tipton ran
a small business and served in the Colorado Legislature before
winning his election. Congressman Joe Walsh helped small
businesses raise capital in Illinois and brings experience, a
lot of experience, to this Committee. And Congressman Allen
West served his country in the military and now serves his
Florida constituents in Congress.
I would also like to welcome those returning Members back:
Mr. Bartlett from Maryland, Mr. Chabot from Ohio, Mr. Coffman
from Colorado, and Mr. King from Iowa.
And now I will yield to Ranking Member Velazquez to
introduce her Members.
Ms. Velazquez. I, too, want to welcome the returning
Members and new Members. We have six new Members on our side:
Representative Judy Chu of California. This is her second term
in Congress and first with the Committee. She will be the
Ranking Member for the Subcommittee on Contracting and Work
Force. Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island. This is
his first term in Congress and he will serve on the Committee
on Foreign Affairs in addition to this Committee.
Representative Richmond of Louisiana. This is his first term
and he will be the ranking on the Subcommittee on Health Care
and Technology. Representative Gary Peters of Michigan. This is
his second term in Congress and first with the Committee. And
Representative Bill Owens of New York. He was first selected in
2009 to fill the seat vacated by John McHugh. And we have
Representative Bill Keating of Massachusetts. This is his first
term in office.
Returning Members: Mr. Schrader of Oregon. This is his
second term. Mark Critz of Pennsylvania. He was first elected
to Congress in early 2010 to fill the seat vacated after
Congressman Murtha passed away. Representative Jason Altmire of
Pennsylvania. This is his third term in Congress and on the
Committee. And Representative Yvette Clarke of New York, also
in her third term in office and with the Committee.
Thank you.
Chairman Graves. Thank you very much. As chairman of the
Committee I definitely want to set the right tone and I would
like to retain the tradition of bipartisanship on this
Committee that stretches all the way back to another
Missourian, former Congressman Chairman Jim Talent. Ranking
Member Velazquez continued the efforts obviously in the 110th
and 111th Congress, which I appreciated very much. And although
we have differences on policy, I strongly believe that there
are many issues which we have found and will continue to find
common ground on that is going to help small businesses by
eliminating unnecessary programs and regulations and improving
the efficiency of the Small Business Administration when it
comes to dealing with entrepreneurs.
I believe that the rules package and oversight plan under
consideration today is going to lay the groundwork for finding
those areas that we have in common while it maintains the
highest levels of civility when we discuss our differences.
And I will now yield to Ranking Member Velazquez for her
opening statement.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to, as I
said before, welcome all the returning Members and the new
Members. And this should be a very busy two years, and we look
forward to continuing our work on behalf of our nation's small
businesses. And I welcome your comments about working in a
bipartisan way. As I have always stated in the past, there is
no Republican or Democratic approach to deal with the many
issues that we need to tackle in terms of small businesses in
our country. It has been said in the past both Republicans and
Democrats want and need small firms to succeed and create jobs
in our communities.
Mr. Chairman, regarding our Committee's rules, they are not
only a vital institutional requirement, but they also set clear
parameters for how we will operate. More importantly, they
contain protections to ensure that all points of views are
considered. The rules foster an environment that facilitates
respectful dialogue, irrespective of ideological beliefs. We
have Members from all across the country representing rural and
urban areas, North and South, East and West. Their viewpoints
inform our hearings and strengthen the legislation we produce.
As a result of these procedures, transparency is enhanced
and information is made more readily available. Doing so
enables Members, as well as the public, to follow and
participate in congressional proceedings more fully. Increasing
the quality and quantity of this information is essential as it
demystifies the work we do on Capitol Hill, permitting us to
better connect with those we serve. A committee that is run
openly and with a sense of comity is a committee that works and
can best achieve its objective. It is my hope that the rules we
consider today will make this happen. Through their adoption we
will start the 112th Congress in a way that permits us to work
across the aisle and to solve the many issues facing small
businesses in America.
And I yield back to the Chairman. Thank you.
Chairman Graves. Thank you. And I want to say outright to
you that I want to thank the minority and majority staffs for
their hard work and cooperation putting together this rules
package. I will highlight some of the changes real quick which
I think are going to provide a lot more transparency.
First of all, in an effort to keep all the Members
informed, materials for markups and hearings are going to be
distributed as soon as possible. In fact, even sooner than what
the House rules require.
Second, Members, I know everybody is busy with a lot of
things out there, so the length of hearings are going to be
kept as short as possible by limiting the number of total
nongovernment witnesses.
And third, the public will be continually informed on
Committee activities through live streaming of Committee
hearings and posting of material distributed to Members and
their votes during markup on the Committee's website. All of
these efforts, I think, are going to ensure greater efficiency
and operation of the Committee and it is going to allow us to
focus on the critical policy needs of small businesses.
In addition to efficiency and transparency of Committee
operations, I believe the rules package protects the rights of
the minority by allowing it to control its budget and ensuring
that subpoenas in most instances are going to be considered by
the full Committee prior to issuance.
So I now recognize Ranking Member Velazquez for her
remarks, if she has any, on the rule package.
Ms. Velazquez. I made my remarks.
Chairman Graves. Okay. So are there any other Members that
have any comments on the rules package?
And if not, we will just move straight forward.
I would now move that the Committee move to consideration
of the rules package, and The Clerk can read them.
Ms. Christian. Rules and Procedures Adopted by the
Committee on Small Business, United States House of
Representatives, 112th Congress.
Chairman Graves. Okay. I would ask unanimous consent that
the rules package be considered as read and open for amendment
in its entirety. Does any Member seek recognition for the
purpose of offering an amendment?
Seeing no amendments to the question on adopting the rules,
all those in favor say aye.
[Chorus of ayes]
Chairman Graves. All opposed, no? It is the opinion of the
Chair that the ayes have it. The Rules of the Small Business
Committee of the 112th Congress are now adopted.
Today's second order of business is to consider the
Committee's Oversight Plan. This plan represents the agenda for
the Committee during the 112th Congress. I want to thank
Ranking Member Velazquez for her input into this Oversight
Plan. During my tenure on this Committee I have recognized
significant management issues at the Small Business
Administration, discovered that small businesses obviously must
climb substantial barriers to enter Federal contracting
markets. We determined that Federal agencies ignore the impact
of their regulations on entrepreneurs in many cases. I believe
that the Oversight Plan reflects those concerns and sets an
appropriately aggressive agenda for the Committee to develop
policies that will benefit small businesses and help the
economy create much needed jobs.
With that, I would yield to Ranking Member Velazquez for
any comments she has on the Oversight Plan.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Oversight Plan sets forth a policy framework for this
Congress and the Chairman is to be commended on producing a
thoughtful document. While our broad jurisdiction provides the
basis to look into just about any policy matter affecting small
businesses, I am heartened by its emphasis on job creation.
This is a very appropriate use of our Committee's time and
resources. It calls for the robust oversight of the Small
Business Administration and other Federal small business
initiatives, a long tradition that this Committee takes
seriously. A recent examination of the Small Business Disaster
and Contracting Program has produced positive changes and are
but two examples of the benefits that congressional oversight
can produce.
Finally, the Oversight Plan delineates several programs for
review and possible termination. Our past work has revealed
that there are agency programs that lack a clear focus and may
be duplicative. It has always been a part of our core
responsibility to carefully examine such instances and consider
alternative options as well as their elimination. This is
central to why I have always advocated for the two-year
authorization period for the Small Business Administration and
its programs.
Federal agencies must justify the programs they operate
regularly and Congress should be seeking feedback from
stakeholders about what is working and what is not.
Collaborating with my colleagues on these matters and making
the SBA more efficient in its use of taxpayer dollars is a top
priority. Congress needs a clear agenda for assisting small
firms, and it is paramount that we start addressing these
issues as soon as possible. By doing so we have the potential
to truly help create new jobs and move the economy forward.
With that, I urge Members to approve this Oversight Plan.
Chairman Graves. In the essence of time, because we have
votes at 1:15, I will move directly to the consideration of the
Oversight Plan. Will The Clerk please read the title?
Ms. Christian. Oversight Plan of the Committee on Small
Business for the 112th Congress.
Chairman Graves. I would ask unanimous consent that the
Oversight Plan be considered as read and open for amendment in
its entirety. Does any Member seek recognition for the purpose
of offering an amendment?
Seeing no amendments the question is on adopting the
oversight package. All of those in favor say aye.
[Chorus of ayes]
Chairman Graves. All opposed say no.
It is the opinion of the chair that the ayes have it. The
Oversight Plan for the Small Business Committee of the 112th
Congress is adopted.
With that real quick, and since they called the roll, I do
want to thank Ranking Member Velazquez for the way the
Committee worked. And for the new Members, this Committee does
a real good job of working together in the best interest of
small business. And it has always been that way and I want it
to continue that way.
Chairwoman Velazquez had a gavel that she used which I
thought was pretty neat because it was part of her native
Puerto Rico. It was special wood that came from there and I
told her if she was smart she would get a Missouri walnut
gavel, which I have for her now, which I am going to give to
her. But this gavel, my great, great grandparents built a house
on one of our farms in 1865, and the wood out of that house,
when my brother took that over, we kept a bunch of it and this
is part of the stair railing that went down to the basement in
that house. And my son turned this gavel, made it. This is real
Missouri walnut and it came out of my family's home.
We could not have two districts that are completely
different. I drove through the Ranking Member's district here
not too long ago. You did not know that. And I think the only
thing that we have in common is she represents the only tri-
borough district in the country and I have the town of Westboro
in my district. And I think that is the only thing that we have
in common between us.
But with that, this is a Missouri walnut gavel and I wanted
to give that to you.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.
You might be looking for trouble.
Chairman Graves. That's right.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you very much. Very kind. And for the
new Members who were not here when we made our opening remarks,
let me just echo the words and comments made by our Chairman.
Here we care about providing the tools and making sure that we
have a climate that is conducive for small businesses to do
what they do best and that is to create jobs. We work in a
bipartisan way. We have done it in the past and I look forward
to a collaborative and productive two years. That will not mean
that we do not have our differences.
Chairman Graves. That is right.
Ms. Velazquez. And they will be clearly stated. But as much
as we can, we will address those issues in a bipartisan
climate.
Chairman Graves. I want to thank everybody for coming. I
look forward to working with you. So this meeting of the Small
Business Committee is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 1:14 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
