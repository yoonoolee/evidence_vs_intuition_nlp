----------

WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 1, 2012

House of Representatives,
Committee on Small Business,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 1:00 p.m., in Room
2360, Rayburn House Office Building. Hon. Sam Graves (chairman
of the Committee) presiding.
Present: Representatives Graves, Chabot, Tipton, West,
Walsh, Hanna, Schilling, Velazquez, Owens, Chu, and Hahn.
Chairman Graves. Good afternoon, everyone. This hearing
will come to order. And I want to thank our witness, Richard
Cordray, the director of Consumer Finance Protection Bureau for
appearing before our Committee today. We very much look forward
to your testimony.
Today marks the Committee's first official look at the work
of the CFPB, specifically as it affects small businesses. CFPB
is drafting a number of regulations that will impose new
requirements and compliance costs on broad segments of the U.S.
economy. One of those regulations seeks to bring simplicity and
transparency to real estate transactions.
For many years, consumers, industry, and regulators have
recognized that the mortgage disclosure forms required by the
Truth and Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures
Act overlap and are a source of confusion. The proposed rule,
which is required by Dodd-Frank or the Dodd-Frank Act, will
integrate those disclosure forms. Integrating and simplifying
the disclosures is a laudable goal but these changes are going
to affect small businesses.
Many of my colleagues here today, including myself,
question the wisdom of the Dodd-Frank Act and many of the
provisions within it, including the creation of the CFPB.
However, those issues are not the subject of this hearing, but
rather we are seeking to determine the extent to which the CFPB
is complying with another law meant to protect small
businesses, and that is the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
Much of the public attention on this rulemaking has been
focused on the disclosure forms that consumers will see when
they are taking out home mortgage loans. Our Committee is
interested in how the regulations will affect small firms--
those community banks, credit unions, mortgage brokers,
mortgage companies, and settlement agents that will need to
change business operations so they are going to have to upgrade
software, retrain their employees to comply. Furthermore, the
Committee is looking at the quality of the CFPB's assessment of
the likely impacts of the rule, as well as the alternatives
being considered to lower costs for small firms.
As the CFPB began developing this regulation, it determined
that the changes would likely have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small firms under the RFA. As
a result, the CFPB convened a Small Business Advocacy Review
Panel to receive input from affected small businesses and
completed an initial regulatory flexibility analysis, which was
required by the RFA.
On July 9, 2012, the CFPB posted the 1,100 page proposed
rule on their website. And while the CFPB has followed the
steps the RFA requires, there appears to be holes in the
agency's assessment of the economic impact of the rule on small
businesses and very little discussion of how the alternatives
may reduce economic burdens.
Even with the sluggish economy, the CFPB is expected to
issue many more rules, some as a direct mandate from the Dodd-
Frank Act and others at its discretion. Despite our concerns
with the latitude the CFPB has been granted, we hope they will
honor the spirit and the letter of the RFA, and become a model
actor with respect to this law that seeks to protect small
business firms so they can thrive, which is something our
economy sorely needs.
We appreciate the director's participation today on this
oversight hearing. I now yield to Ranking Member Velazquez for
her opening statement.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Since its enactment two years ago, Dodd-Frank has attracted
significant attention from both critics and supporters. Of all
the act's provisions, it has been Title X, which creates the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that has attracted the
greatest amount of scrutiny. This new agency is responsible for
protecting consumers from unfair, deceptive, and abusive
financial products. Last July, the CFPB started operations,
making this an opportune time to review how it is affecting
American small businesses.
Although the CFPB's primary role is to regulate financial
products marketed to consumers, this rule also impacts small
business owners. Small firms are major consumers of financial
products, too. Nearly half use personal credit cards to finance
their enterprises, while one in five utilize home equity loans
for business purposes. It is clear that CFPB rules will
influence small businesses seeking capital and credit. With the
agency's broad responsibility, it is important that it balance
the need to prevent abusive practices without adversely
affecting the credit conditions facing small firms.
It was for this very reason that meaningful safeguards were
incorporated into CFPB's enacting legislation. These efforts
were designed to mitigate the potentially negative effects of
this new agency on the small business community. For this
reason, small community banks with assets of less than $10
billion were excluded from the reach of the agency as were
retailers and merchants. So, too, were businesses that are
already subject to insurance or securities regulation at the
state level. Some entire industries dominated by smaller
entities are also excluded from CFPB authority, such as
realtors and auto dealers. Clearly, lawmakers recognize that
small businesses were not the cause of the financial crisis and
should not bear the burden of new regulations.
Beyond these exclusions, small businesses were given
additional protections. CFPB must conduct small business
advocacy review panels for certain rules, becoming only the
third agency required to do so. Along with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act safeguards, this will allow small firms
concerns about CFPB's regulation to be heard. Doing so can help
reduce the impact on small firms while minimizing any
additional costs of credit to them.
The real issue before this Committee is one of oversight.
Our responsibility today is not to exhume all arguments of
ancient political battles, but to examine whether the agency is
carrying out its mission in a way that safeguards consumers
without overburdening small businesses. If done properly, this
agency can make the entire financial system and economy more
stable without constricting our nation's entrepreneurs.
With this in mind, it is not only the lingering memories of
the financial crisis that make us remember why we created the
CFPB in the first place. Almost every day we hear from a
constituent about an erroneous credit report, pressure tactics
from credit card companies, abusive payday loans, or coercive
financing scams. As long as financial products are laden with
fine print, scare tactics, and incoherent penalties, consumers
will be unable to truly drive our economy forward.
I want to thank Director Cordray for being here and I look
forward to his testimony. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Graves. Thank you, Nydia.
Our witness, Richard Cordray, is the first director of the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and he was appointed to
the position in January 2012. Prior to becoming director, he
led the CFPB's Enforcement Division. He is a native of Ohio,
and Director Cordray has served the state of Ohio in several
elected positions, which included attorney general, treasurer,
the Franklin County treasurer, and state representative for the
33rd Ohio House District. Director Cordray has also appointed
the first solicitor general in Ohio's history. We are very
pleased to have you today and your entire written testimony
will be entered in the record. So, please.

STATEMENT OF RICHARD CORDRAY, DIRECTOR, CONSUMER FINANCIAL
PROTECTION BUREAU

Mr. Cordray. Thank you, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member
Velazquez, and members of this Committee for having me here
today. I look forward to talking with you about the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau's work and how it does and does not
affect small businesses.
When I served as the Ohio Treasurer, I revived a small
business lending program that pumped hundreds of millions of
dollars into buying down the interest rate on small business
loans to encourage job creation. From this experience of
working closely with small businesses in Ohio, alongside the
National Federation of Independent Businesses, I came to learn
a great deal about how small businesses work, what conditions
they need in order to grow, and their vital importance to local
economies. I personally visited many small businesses, which
are an important engine for our economy, as you know. It is
critical for everyone in government to understand what is
necessary for small businesses to grow and prosper in today's
economy.
The Consumer Bureau is responsible for administering and
enforcing the laws that relate to the provision of financial
products and services to consumers for personal or household
use. Small community banks and credit unions, and certain other
small providers, are an essential source of financing for many
of these consumers.
Since the Bureau was launched just over a year ago, we have
designed a number of ways to invite small businesses to provide
their opinions about our work. We believe good public policy
means getting as much feedback as we can, and that is exactly
what we do with owners and representatives of small providers
from across the country.
To this end, we are setting up advisory councils to help us
focus on how our work affects community banks and credit unions
in particular. We have also created an Office of Community
Banks and Credit Unions within our Office of External Affairs.
And we have had hundreds of meetings and discussions thus far
with small banks and credit unions, reaching every state in the
country.
We have also been holding small business review panels
during our rulemaking process. So far, we have convened three
such panels, along with the Office for Advocacy of the SBA and
the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within OMB as
required by law. These meetings consist of intensive, in-depth
discussions about our upcoming rulemakings with small providers
early in the process to help us shape our proposals around
their specific input.
This process makes us unique among the banking agencies as
the only one that holds such panels. Fifteen to 20 people from
small businesses and small nonprofit organizations may join us
for each of these panels. They come from urban and rural areas,
different segments of the market, and different parts of the
country. We purposely seek this diversity to better inform the
whole picture of the relevant marketplace throughout the United
States. They get advance notice about the early shape of our
proposed rules, and they come prepared to discuss with us how
these proposals would affect their businesses, both
substantively and operationally. We come prepared to listen to
their input, address their questions, and learn.
During the panel meetings, our staff discusses the
background, objectives, and elements of the proposed rule under
consideration. The small businesses usually talk about the
costs, operational changes, and other impacts from their
perspective. They give their frank opinions--positive and
negative--about the proposal and offer suggestions on how to
improve it. It is a collaborative effort all around, and the
participants have told us that they appreciate the care and
effort involved.
These small business review sessions, which typically last
a full day, have proven to be valuable to us. From the panel we
held on proposed changes to the federally required mortgage
disclosure forms, we learned, for example, that we needed to
provide more detailed guidance to accompany the rule, which
smaller providers viewed as helpful for their compliance
efforts. Indeed, the small businesses told us that smaller
settlement agents can lose a half-hour per closing because they
struggle to understand various issues with the current rules.
And that is multiplied across millions of real estate closings.
So we took that insight in drafting our proposal, which now
contains extensive commentary that details precisely how to
complete the proposed forms; it also includes samples of
completed forms. This extra material has become more specific
in order to make it easier to implement the rules once they are
adopted.
These panels and the detailed reports they write afterward
have played an important part in these rulemakings. As in
everything we do, we are open to feedback and will continue to
refine our processes as we gain more experience. The bottom-
line is we are committed to include small businesses in our
rulemaking and to shape our proposals based on their input.
Let me close by saying that at the Consumer Bureau we
believe in smart regulation. Although we are seeking to
streamline and simplify rules, when we are told it would be
helpful to provide more detail and more specifics--which is a
suggestion we hear often from industry--we take that into
account. We recognize that while we are issuing regulations to
protect consumers, we are also issuing regulations to provide
certainty to financial providers. Because we believe in the
free enterprise system, we want to see honest, fair consumer
financial businesses compete and thrive. Clear rules of the
road that reflect the input of small providers help achieve
that goal. That is good for consumers and for the overall
economy.
Thank you. I look forward to your questions.
[The statement of Mr. Cordray appears in the Appendix.]
Chairman Graves. Thank you very much. I appreciate the
testimony. We will start out, Alan.
Mr. West. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Madam Ranking Member.
Thank you, Mr. Cordray for being here today.
And you are right. I was not here when Dodd-Frank was
passed, so we are not going back to do a history lesson. We are
going to look at the law of unintended consequences.
One of the things and your written testimony talks about
tight statutory deadlines. And I guess that is part of the law
that was written in there. But my concern is that when I look
at these small business advocacy panels that you have, review
panels, that some of the individuals, these small entity
representatives were only notified, you know, a couple weeks
before and then yet we are asking for written input back a week
later. Do you really feel when you look at the economic impact
of some of these rules and regulations that that really is
enough time for them to operate? And do you think that you can
come back to us and ask for, you know, extended times if that
does constrain you?
Mr. Cordray. Thank you, Congressman. It is actually a very
good question. It is----
Mr.  Well, thank you.
Mr. Cordray [continuing]. Part of the landscape that we are
dealing with over this first year in particular. We have some
very tight statutory deadlines. We have a number of mortgage
rules that are required to be in place by January. If they are
not in place, I would note that there are statutory provisions
that kick in of their own accord. So whether we write the rules
or not, things are going to change according to what Congress
has done. But writing the rules allows us to get a lot of input
from people and perhaps soften or change or modify some of the
provisions. So I think for the most part, a lot of the industry
is very supportive of us meeting our deadlines and being tight
on that.
Mr. West. But do you think the one--the one week gives them
really enough time----
Mr. Cordray. Yes.
Mr. West [continuing]. To look at this?
Mr. Cordray. So as to the balance of your question, in
retrospect, we would have preferred to have had more time to
prepare the panels. And we will in the future have more time to
prepare the panels. I will say it is a self-selected group.
This 15 or 20 people from around the country, who very much
wanted to participate in this process, were picked out in part
by themselves and organizations that sponsored them. So they
had a real incentive to be involved in the process. They did
comment that it was a very quick timeframe and that is what we
are living under. In the future, it will be nice to have more
time for that and we expect to allow more time.
Mr. West. So is there a way that we can come back and say
if we do not get this thing right we need more time to get it
right instead of rushing into it? You know, one of the things
in the military we say you are always trying to a standard, not
to a time. So I want to make sure that we get the standard
correct and not just worry about the time. I mean, do you feel
that you have the flexibility to come back and ask for more
time if the industry members ask for that?
Mr. Cordray. By the way, I noticed your Army background. We
have some real leaders at the Bureau who have an Army
background and they keep us pretty straight.
Mr. West. Good. That is better than the Navy.
Mr. Cordray. But what I would say is we will always be
subject to any dictates that Congress lays down for us. If
Congress decides we should have more time, we will be glad to
take more time. If Congress wants us to be faster, we will be
faster. We are a law enforcement agency and what you tell us to
do is what we will do.
Mr. West. Okay. The second question. If there are other
agencies outside of CFPB that provide rules or regulations, are
those rules and regulations also going to go through the same
type of advocacy review panels or will they be able to slip
under the radar screen and get implemented without having that
process?
Mr. Cordray. In the law as it currently stands, the small
business review panels, which we have actually found to be
quite valuable, only apply in the federal government to the
EPA, OSHA, and now to the CFPB. They do not apply to other
financial regulators. That was the wisdom of Congress and that
is the statute that we are enforcing. So the answer to your
question is other than us, the EPA, and OSHA, that process does
not apply to the rest of the federal government.
Mr. West. Do you think that that is something where we
should go back and look at amending in case you have the
Federal Reserve or someone else that tries to, you know, send
in a rule and regulation that we need to make sure that they
have to go through the exact same process?
Mr. Cordray. I find that I have my hands full trying to run
my own new agency. I typically do not go out of my way to offer
suggestions to Congress about how other agencies can be
governed. They can certainly offer that perspective themselves.
I do not really have a position on that.
Mr. West. But I guess the question that I am asking in the
last 40 seconds is do you want to make sure that other federal
government agencies cannot slip under the radar screen and
implement rules and regulations that do not end up going
through your small business advocacy review panels? And the
next thing you know this is, you know, surprise, surprise. Here
is something else. And again, the unintended consequences, the
economic impact is exacerbated even more.
Mr. Cordray. Again, I would defer to Congress. I would
leave it to them. I would say that we are working hard to
collaborate closely with our fellow banking agencies and other
agencies and departments of the federal government and state
and local government. We think that we will do our work better
if we are in partnership with others and that we are on the
same page so that the kind of small businesses you all are
looking out for are not confused because different people come
at them from different perspectives. I do think that is quite
important.
Mr. West. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Cordray, in the last Congress, the House passed the
Medical Debt Relief Act requiring paid or settled medical debt
to be removed from credit reports within 45 days. That bill
directly addressed the negative impacts such information has on
a consumer's credit score. With your recent announcement that
the CFPB would regulate credit bureaus, do you plan to address
how medical debt is created on credit reports?
Mr. Cordray. That is a very interesting question and
something that we have been grappling with at the Bureau. Not
only as medical debt affects credit reporting bureaus as your
question goes to, but also as it affects debt collection, which
intersects obviously with credit bureaus. That is often the way
things end up getting reported to credit bureaus.
We have found medical debt is a particularly difficult
challenge because it is hard at times to define when a debt
begins in the medical debt realm. You know, you will go to your
doctor and you will receive services and it may be understood
by the doctor's office that you do not necessarily pay on the
spot. They will bill you later. When do you actually owe the
debt? Is it as soon as services are rendered or is it after the
first round of billing is done? There are often disputes
between insurance companies as to what they cover and do not
cover. I know from my family we may not know for a period of
months exactly whether we owe a $10 co-pay or whether we owe
$250 or whatever it is. So whether you would consider that debt
or whether it is still a disputed item not yet firmed up, it is
a hard issue.
So what I would say is this. We have announced recently the
finalization of our Larger Participant Role. This is the
special process that is laid upon us if we are going to be
overseeing financial providers that are not banks in new realms
such as credit reporting. We are going to be overseeing and
supervising the larger participants in the credit reporting
industry. That will cover about 30 or so credit reporting
companies, including the three very largest that are the ones
that people are most familiar with, which keep consumer files
on millions and millions of Americans. We will be overseeing
all of their approach to this, including medical debt.
We are in the process of working through issues of medical
debt as it relates to what will soon be our supervisory
coverage of debt collectors. We will continue to work through
those issues. It is a sensitive spot. I know from my experience
at the local level, where I collected real estate taxes at one
time that one of the big issues that created delinquency for
people was illness, injury, or death in the family. The debts
that piled up around that often put people into default or
foreclosure. So it is an issue we are very concerned about. We
will be looking at the credit reporting bureaus with respect to
that debt and all debt.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you.
One of the key responsibilities given to the CFPB is the
supervision of nonbanks. What role can these nonbank entities
play in providing alternative sources of capital for consumers
and small businesses?
Mr. Cordray. We have seen in a number of markets that
nonbank firms have been providing significant access to capital
for individual and family consumers. We saw that in the
mortgage market significantly before the mortgage breakdown and
financial meltdown of 2007-2008, a tremendous amount of
financed mortgages that did not go through any kind of bank or
credit union or thrift or any kind of chartered institution.
One of the problems in that market was that some parts of it
were regulated and some parts of it were not regulated. And,
you know, whatever your regime is, whether you think regulation
can be a good thing or a bad thing, whether it is good in these
circumstances and not in those circumstances, whatever your
view is, the notion you would regulate part of a market and
leave part of it unregulated, that does not work. I mean, that
just does not work.
Ms. Velazquez. You put at a disadvantage----
Mr. Cordray. It is unfair advantages for some and
disadvantages for others. It tends to reward the irresponsible
who do not bear the same costs as the responsible. That was
part of the problem in the mortgage market and it is part of
what was changed, and I think much for the better, under Dodd-
Frank. So we are now, for example, overseeing and enforcing the
law against both bank and nonbank mortgage originators and
mortgage servicers, which has been a significant source of
problems for individuals in districts across this country.
In other markets as well, you know, the market for short-
term small dollar loans, which is a difficult market, one that
is supplied often these days by payday lenders or other
providers, maybe pawn brokers, maybe rent-to-own, other things.
It is a market where there is a lot of concern about how
consumers are treated. On the other hand, it is a market where
consumers have a demand for that credit. So that is another
area where we will cover both bank and nonbank sides of that,
and I think that is helpful.
But there is no question that the banking system alone has
not provided access to credit that satisfies the needs of the
American public. We have estimates of 80 to 90 million people
who are either not banked at all or who have a bank account but
use many other services outside the banking system to meet
their needs. This Bureau cares about all of those consumers as
well. It is not just if you are in the banking system or get
yourself into the banking system; it is also how can we meet
your needs in that space with the prepaid cards and other
things? And it is very fast evolving, so it is hard for us to
keep up with it.
Ms. Velazquez. Can you talk to us about the memorandum of
understanding that the CFPB signed with the STC to deal with
jurisdiction or overlap between the agencies? Will these be
enough to limit bureaucratic duplication or do you think that
there might be something else that needs to happen?
Mr. Cordray. What you are inquiring about is the fact that
we now have authority over many nonbank providers of financial
products and services, but Congress decided to retain
overlapping jurisdiction with the Federal Trade Commission in
many of these areas. They typically do not have jurisdiction
over banks, but they do over nonbanks.
Congress specified that we needed to work out a memorandum
of understanding between us and the FTC as to how we would
jointly use our combined resources to address problems in that
space. We have worked very closely with the FTC. They have been
a great partner, unusual among federal agencies from what I
know from over the years. They have really reached out and
worked with us. We did reach a memorandum of understanding in
July, which was the deadline for us doing so. And we have been
working with them very productively on a number of different
issues.
The other actors that have some role in the same space are
state regulators and state attorneys general.
We have also been trying to forge a constructive
partnership with them. Ultimately, what you would want, I
think, is for all of us in this space who do have the ability
to oversee and crack down on illegal practices by nonbank
providers, to coordinate our efforts and resources, to create
the best bang for the buck for consumers. And also in ways that
do not do stupid things by double teaming or duplicating. There
is plenty enough for us to do without us trying to do the same
things as one another. But that requires a lot of communication
and coordination.
Ms. Velazquez. My last question. Because, you know, we
basically, this is the Small Business Committee and a lot of
concerns have been raised by small firms who are concerned that
they will be subject to the CFPB oversight for financial
transactions. So my question to you is will your agency attempt
to exercise oversight over financial products when no consumer
is involved?
Mr. Cordray. I do not think that we have the authority to
be involved in a financial product where no consumer is
involved. Our statutes are pretty clear that we are supposed to
be--as a general matter, there may be some specific provisions
in the statute that are different from that--but as a general
matter, our authority is over consumer financial products and
services defined as credit and financial products for
individuals, households, for their families, for their personal
purposes, not business credit, not business-to-business
dealings. Again, there are a few odds and ends in our statute
where that somehow relates, but that is in general not our
field.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Graves. Scott.
Mr. Tipton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr.
Cordray, for being here today.
I would like to be able to explore just a couple issues
with you. Recently, you were testifying today that the CFPB is
taking some steps to be able to mitigate some of the criticism
that you regard in some of the--is it the Tell a RESPA Rule? Is
that how it is referred to?
Mr. Cordray. Yes.
Mr. Tipton. And it being 1,099 pages and you put up a blog
post that said it was actually only 400 and some odd pages and
the rest was regulatory just to be able to get some definitions
out. Did you get feedback? And can you understand that for
small businesses, when we start issuing 400 new pages of
regulatory requirements that this actually becomes a burden?
Mr. Cordray. Let me say several things. First of all, to
sort of correct the record, there is about 200 pages of that
that is the rule. There are about 200 pages of guidance that we
included; particularly in response to input from small
providers who told us that absent guidance and clarification on
things they found that they lost time trying to figure things
out, trying to interpret it. That is what I referred to up to
half an hour per real estate closing multiplied by millions of
closings.
So that is what they told us, and it is kind of
counterintuitive for me. I mean, I would prefer to have short,
simple rules, but these are complicated matters. They have
asked for more detail, more specificity, which ultimately means
more pages in order that they will not have lots of questions
afterwards. And by the way, if we issued a short rule, simple
rule, but left things vague, what happens is everything still
has to be figured out. It gets worked out on the back end. It
often involves litigation. It involves going into court to get
a court to tell you what it actually means. That is expensive
for businesses. It obviously takes time. There is uncertainty
all during that time.
You know, a comparison I would make is the U.S.
Constitution. It is a simple, very elegant document. For 200
years, courts have been construing what it means, and there is
a huge amount of pages now that have been generated by that.
What industry has told us--again, it was contrary to my initial
instinct on this--was if they can have more specificity and
clarity up front, then there will be less to argue about
afterwards, less litigation, and also more certainty for them
on how to proceed. So again, optically, I do not like the look
of a longer rule, but they have told us in some respects that
makes their work easier.
Mr. Tipton. And with respect to your statements, did you do
a cost benefit analysis on this?
Mr. Cordray. We are required by our statute to do an
analysis of the burdens, impacts, and benefits of any rule.
Mr. Tipton. What did that show?
Mr. Cordray. I beg your pardon?
Mr. Tipton. Are you doing that now?
Mr. Cordray. We have been doing that. We have to do that at
the proposal stage, so we have done that. We have to do that as
we go.
Mr. Tipton. Just out of curiosity, what are those costs
going to be?
Mr. Cordray. Well, I think the costs are the ones that
people told us about. First of all, there is always a
transitional cost with any change. Even when you streamline.
Mr. Tipton. Do you have a dollar amount?
Mr. Cordray. Well, there is a lot of analysis provided in
the rule. I would hesitate to summarize, you know, what is, as
you know----
Mr. Tipton. Ballpark?
Mr. Cordray [continuing]. Hundreds of pages. Well, there
are costs that are implementation costs of making a transition.
Mr. Tipton. Right.
Mr. Cordray. And then as we go----
Mr. Tipton. I just want a ballpark figure.
Mr. Cordray. It is important to recognize here, as we go,
since we will have integrated these two forms as Congress has
been wanting to do for 20 years and nobody has succeeded in
doing it yet, that will mean less cost per individual real
estate closing.
Mr. Tipton. So you do not have an actual dollar number? A
vague dollar number?
Mr. Cordray. There are dollar numbers provided. Again----
Mr. Tipton. That is what I was asking.
Mr. Cordray. Okay. I can refer you to our rule and you
can--your staff--there are different dollar figures for
different kinds of providers.
Mr. Tipton. Did you give us dollar figures?
Mr. Cordray. I beg your pardon?
Mr. Tipton. Did you give us--just curious.
Mr. Cordray. Sure. What I wanted to note was over time this
is going to save money.
Mr. Tipton. You are 101 million. Does that sound familiar?
Mr. Cordray. That is a potential figure, depending on what
assumptions you are making about who uses vendors and who does
things on their own. But again, there is going to be a savings,
sir. It is important to realize.
Mr. Tipton. I would like to be able to--we are running out
of time here. At the beginning of your statement you had
noted--made the statement ``critical for people in government
to know what makes small business grow.''
Mr. Cordray. Yes.
Mr. Tipton. And you talked about access to capital. If
those dollars are being spent more and more on regulatory
compliance, $101 million, is that draining money out of
resources that can be applied to be able to grow jobs, to be
able to get people back to work and get this economy moving?
Mr. Cordray. Okay. So we are talking here about a multi-
trillion dollar market for real estate transactions.
Mr. Tipton. My world $100 million is big dollars.
Mr. Cordray. I understand. But it is not like there are a
million dollars falling on each business. That is not what we
are talking about here. And there is going to be savings in
each real estate settlement closing. Each one over time that
will pile up year by year by millions of transactions. And that
needs to be taken into account as well.
Mr. Tipton. Actually, we received comment, and I believe
you probably have the written testimony as well from the
realtors that they are concerned about this rule. Who is going
to have to be filling out the forms? What some of those costs
are actually going to be, and I think they are deeply
questioning a lot of those actual cost estimates that are being
taken so for granted by the administration.
Mr. Cordray. We met with them and we welcomed their input.
At this point, this is at a proposal stage. It is not yet a
final rule. And so everybody is going to have a chance,
including what I hear today, but also as we go through the
notice and comment process, to give us their input and we will
take that into account on the final rule, including from the
realtors, settlement agents, all of the people involved with
these transactions. Yes. Yes, sir.
Mr. Tipton. You know, with your permission, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Graves. We are short on time.
Mr. Tipton. Okay. I apologize. I yield back. Thank you.
Chairman Graves. Before I turn to Bill, we do have a series
of votes coming up. And we are going to stay--we will stay here
for the first 10 minutes after they are called, but I hate to
keep you through that series, so we may--if anybody has got
questions that can be submitted and then you give us answers,
because I know I do, we will make that a part of the record.
Mr. Cordray. I am at your service.
Chairman Graves. Phil.
Mr. Owens. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks, Mr. Cordray,
for coming over to testify today.
When you talk about small business, how do you define that
term for purposes of inclusion in the Small Business Advisory
Groups?
Mr. Cordray. So, again, that is another interesting
question. The term ``small business'' is somewhat in the eye of
the beholder. It is defined differently often market by market.
So what is a small business in the aerospace industry would
look very different from what is a small business in the
hardware business, for example. The Small Business
Administration has a working definition that they apply as a
rough cut for many markets that if you have revenues of $7
million or less, that is a small business. I can imagine
markets where that would be a very large business, but that is
one cut on it.
It is likely for us going to be something that we will have
to define, taking into account the size of markets. I think the
assets of a bank, for example, would be larger than the assets
of many retail businesses. So it is very contextual. But that
is one definition to begin from and think about and then work
from that. So that is one of the things that we have taken into
account.
Mr. Owens. How did you define it for purposes of the groups
that you assembled?
Mr. Cordray. So, for us, it is as laid out in the
Regulatory Flexibility Act and the small business review
panels, which as I have said have been used previously by the
EPA and by OSHA, who are required by law to use them. We are
the first banking agency of any kind that has been required to
use this process.
And the other thing for us is we do have this other hurdle
we jump through before we can supervise nonbank firms in some
of these other markets besides the mortgage, student loan, and
payday lending markets. We have to define who are larger
participants. And thereto, we started off by taking as one of
the factors--we considered the SBA definition of a small
business. It is $7 million or less. That definition is under
review, by the way, by them right now. But there are some
industries where that makes sense and some industries where
that is probably well off the mark.
Mr. Owens. It has been my experience that settlement agents
tend to be relatively small businesses, a couple of people.
Mortgage brokers in small communities tend to be a couple of
people.
Mr. Cordray. Yes.
Mr. Owens. So that puts, I think as some of my colleagues
were pointing out--some real burden on them in terms of
compliance.
I see in your testimony that you are considering
potentially not requiring electronic retention of records and
allowing paper retention for smaller businesses. Are you seeing
any development by other entrepreneurs of software for this
industry that is graded, if you will, from the couple of person
business up to the 50-person business?
Mr. Cordray. That is happening. That is obviously a
tremendous business opportunity. Part of it is that 30 years
ago there was very little computer involvement. Going back to
my undergraduate days where to do anything on the computer you
went across campus. It was a garage-size thing and you put in
your cards and it took several hours. But now computers
obviously are more and more integrating workplaces everywhere.
And this is a vendor opportunity. So that is developing. But we
have, in response to the input we got from small providers,
some of whom have not gotten to that point and may never get to
that point. They have been in business 20, 25 years. It is
working for them. They do not really see the need to do the
expensive upgrade in computer services. We have put into our
proposal to consider exempting them from this electronic
standard format which we otherwise prefer because it is going
to make things very comparable. But that may not make sense for
all providers and it is something we have listened to them on,
heard from them on, and we are going to consider that as we
finalize a proposal.
Mr. Owens. I also noted that you said that in some of the
instances the small businesses requested that you expand on the
regulatory statements.
Mr. Cordray. Yes. Yes.
Mr. Owens. And that was because they felt that with greater
clarity there would be less litigation and less confusion.
After you did the expansion, what was the response of those
small businesses to the additional information you provided?
Mr. Cordray. I think in general there was appreciation that
we heard from them, listened to them, and responded to them.
Now, of course, people have various disagreements about the
substance of what is in there, you know, whether we took their
proposal or the escrow association's proposal or the credit
union's proposal or something else. There is obviously always
room for substantive disagreements. But I think they like the
fact that we heard their suggestion to include more guidance.
Again, every problem we can solve for them without making
them sort of solve it on their own, which not only involves
uncertainty about whether they are getting it right. You know,
they can be sued under the Truth and Lending Act if they do not
get things right. That can involve expense, or they may feel
the need to consult lawyers, which is expensive. Not something
small businesses want to have to do if they can avoid it.
So everything we can do to clarify that up front, again, it
feels perhaps to some, boy, all these pages. Why all these
pages? Every one of those pages is trying to help solve
problems that people have told us about and we are going to try
to do it as best we can.
Mr. Owens. Thank you very much. I appreciate your answers.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
Chairman Graves. Joe.
Mr. Walsh. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There we go.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Cordray, welcome.
We have heard recently about CFPB's examination
notification process, and it has raised some questions. From
what I understand, financial regulators usually will contact
the entity to be examined by letter to make them aware that an
examination has been planned and send that entity a pre-
examination checklist. I have been told recently that CFPB has
been contacting these entities and on very short notice asking
them to come to Washington, D.C. and meet directly with you.
Why are you calling these entities--you, not yourself--but why
are you calling these entities to Washington, D.C. to simply
notify them of an examination? Or do I have that wrong?
Mr. Cordray. To be frank, Congressman, I am not sure where
that is coming from. That is not, in fact, our practice. I am
not calling people in to meet with me. I do not really see what
the point of that would be.
Mr. Walsh. Are people being--Mr. Cordray, are people being
called to Washington to notify them of a pending examination?
Mr. Cordray. No, they are not. Let me say this. We are a
new agency, so when we notify someone of a pending exam, it is
the first time they have ever heard from us. So what we
typically try to do is set up a meet and greet, but I believe
that we almost always go on site. We do not put the people out.
We go there. And I do not mean me. I mean, our examination
staff. And meet with them and have an initial meeting.
For the other agencies where typically they have been
regulating and supervising and examining those people for
years, you know, they just were there three years ago. Now they
are coming again. It is very common that they would send a
letter. We are trying to do a meeting but we are not calling
them to Washington for that.
Mr. Walsh. You do not know of any instances where you are
calling people to Washington where people are having to come to
Washington to be notified of an examination?
Mr. Cordray. No. What we are doing is there are times when
we are having people come to Washington, or if it is more
convenient we can go to them. Or they may be coming to
Washington anyway and want to come in to see us where we are
talking to them about specific issues of concern.
But in terms of the normal examination process, no, we are
not dragging people to Washington just to tell them we are
going to come to see you in three weeks. That seems kind of
stupid.
Mr. Walsh. Did you simply notify them of an examination?
Mr. Cordray. Yeah. Yeah.
Mr. Walsh. Because you concur that makes no sense?
Mr. Cordray. That would be pretty dumb. We are not doing
that.
Mr. Walsh. Do you have to be present when you are notifying
any small banks or mortgage companies of a pending examination?
Mr. Cordray. No.
Mr. Walsh. You, yourself.
Mr. Cordray. And, in fact, you know, I am running an agency
that is growing and is doing work all across the 50 states. I
could not possibly do that. That would not make any sense for
me. That would be a very poor delegation of authority on my
part.
Ms. Velazquez. Would the gentleman yield?
Mr. Walsh. Yes, I would be happy to.
Ms. Velazquez. I just would like for Mr. Cordray to correct
for the record the question itself when he asked small banks
are cold. They are exempted.
Mr. Cordray. Well, small banks, anything under $10 billion
in assets, we do not even examine. So none of them would be
called anywhere. But it is also not our practice to call people
to Washington to inform them of an upcoming exam.
Mr. Walsh. And you have made that clear. And I thank----
Mr. Cordray. Yeah. Although there are some special issues
where we need to talk to someone about a particular issue that
might or might not warrant a meeting.
Mr. Walsh. So banks and mortgage lenders, you have made
that clear that you do not know of any instances. And again, it
is not at all a requirement that you or your deputy director,
Mr. Dante, needs to be present or is present during any of
these meetings.
Mr. Cordray. Frankly, our examiners are much better
equipped to manage and handle all aspects of the exams than I
would be.
Mr. Walsh. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Graves. Janice.
Ms. Hahn. Thank you, Chairman, and ranking member for
holding this hearing.
You know, look, our economy is still reeling and recovering
from what I believe was the damage that was caused by this
housing crisis. And I know my small businesses, their biggest
complaint is they have lost customers. So they are really
concerned when folks are losing their homes and surrounding
cities are contemplating bankruptcy as a result of it. So my
small businesses want their customers to stay in their homes.
So I, for one, am grateful that you are going to be able to do
anything you can to make sure that folks really understand what
they are getting into when they are getting into a mortgage.
You know, before, even--we now know that before the housing
crisis, several banks were participating in predatory lending
and were in some cases blatantly targeting minorities. And we
know that even after controlling for income differences, the
Center for Responsible Lending found that African American and
Latino borrowers were about 30 percent more likely to get
higher rate subprime loans than white borrowers with similar
risk characteristics.
Can you tell me how the proposed rule will help to end this
discrimination? And anything else that you can share that the
CFPB is doing to protect minority borrowers from these, what I
consider shameful predatory lending practices.
Chairman Graves. Quickly.
Mr. Cordray. Thank you Congresswoman. There have been, as
you have probably seen, several enforcement actions in recent
months taken by our fellow regulators. We work closely with
them. We now have the authority to enforce the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act, which will govern a lot of this kind of
discrimination. We take that responsibility very seriously. We
have an Office of Fair Lending in the Bureau. It is, I would
say at this point, superbly staffed by high quality people who
are very dedicated to this work. We are working closely with
the Department of Justice as well, and there are times where we
will coordinate with them on actions. And we are working with
state attorneys general where that is appropriate.
But we feel that everybody in the United States is entitled
to access credit on the same terms as one another. It should
certainly not be affected by gender or by race or by ethnic
background. Too often that has occurred in the past. The laws
are now meant to prevent that. They have to be enforced
effectively if we are going to accomplish that. That is part of
our mission.
Chairman Graves. Thank you. I do not want to keep you, so I
am going to ask the members that have questions, including
myself, to submit them to you and get--in fact, my question is
just about you said in your statement that the panels are a
very valuable component of our rulemaking process. And I am
very curious as to if you think that other federal agencies
should incorporate the panel process to their rulemaking? And I
would like an answer. Just submit it back. You do not have to
answer now but I want an honest answer.
Mr. Cordray. We will be happy to address anything anybody
wants to submit to us in writing, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Graves. And that way we do not have to keep you. I
know you are a very busy director.
Mr. Cordray. Okay.
Chairman Graves. This Committee is going to continue to be
very active in watching how you move through the Reg Flex Act.
Mr. Cordray. I am at your service any time.
Chairman Graves. We appreciate it. And in fact, and I would
ask unanimous consent, too, before I finish with the ranking
member, unanimous consent that we have 10 legislative days for
members to support materials and questions, whatever the case
may be. And without objection, so ordered. Go ahead.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Two questions. Can you state for the record how much--did
the housing collapse cause this nation?
Mr. Cordray. It was trillions of dollars in household
wealth, let alone trying to assess people who lost jobs and how
much, you know, the downturn affected our broader economy.
Ms. Velazquez. And I am interested in knowing when the
agency is going to comply with section 1071. That is aimed at
helping regulators understand credit conditions for small
women-owned businesses and minority-owned businesses. It is
important that you implement the rule requiring the collection
of that data.
Mr. Cordray. Yes, we are mindful of that. We also, as you
may know, we have a separate window on this through our Office
of Minority and Women Inclusion. And that gives us some ability
to work with the financial industry on diversity in the
industry which we take seriously as well. So I think all those
things fit together.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Graves. Again, thank you very much Director
Cordray. We appreciate you coming in. And with that, the
hearing is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 1:53 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
