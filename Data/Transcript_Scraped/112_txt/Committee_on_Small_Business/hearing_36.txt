ELIMINATING JOB-SAPPING FEDERAL RULES THROUGH RETROSPECTIVE REVIEWS
OVERSIGHT OF THE PRESIDENT'S EFFORTS

WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 2011

House of Representatives,
Committee on Small Business,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 1 p.m., in room
2360, Rayburn House Office Building. Hon. Sam Graves (chairman
of the Committee) presiding.
Present: Representatives Graves, Bartlett, Tipton, West,
Herrera Beutler, Ellmers, Hanna, Velazquez, Clarke, and Owens.
Chairman Graves. Good afternoon. We'll call the hearing to
order. And I appreciate everyone being here.
On January 18, 2011, the President issued Executive Order
No. 13,563 mandating that agencies review the economic
consequences of their existing rules. In this regard, President
Obama follows a very well-trodden path that started with
President Carter and has been followed by each succeeding
president. President Obama, like his predecessors when calling
for a review of regulations, noted the special importance of
small businesses in the economy and the potential adverse
consequences of imposing unnecessary and unduly burdensome
rules on small businesses. At the same time he issued that
Executive Order, the President also released a memorandum
reminding agencies of the importance of assessing the impact of
regulations on small businesses through compliance with the
Regulatory Flexibility Act. Despite these reviews, the Code of
Federal Regulations now extends to about 26 linear feet. Of
course, this excludes the potentially hundreds of thousands of
pages of guidance documents interpreting those 26 feet of
regulations.
This complexity imposes serious strains on small
businesses. They have to divert limited management resources
from running their business to understanding how they must
comply with federal regulations. And once they figure out how
to comply, they must expend scarce capital on the cost of
compliance, be it modifications to facilities or new data
systems to maintain those records. Since small businesses
represent the bulk of entities subject to regulation and
generate the most new jobs, I believe that it is very
appropriate to focus the regulatory review on small businesses.
I will close with the admonition from Albert Einstein that
it is easy to make things bigger and more complex, but it takes
a touch of genius and courage to move in the opposite
direction. I hope that the Administrator can provide that touch
of genius and courage to reduce the complexity of federal
regulation and eliminate unnecessary burdens on small
businesses so that they can create jobs and put Americans back
to work.
With that I will recognize the ranking member for her
opening statement.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Small businesses are critical to the economy, creating
nearly 70 percent of new jobs, generating more than 50 percent
of GDP. The contributions are needed now more than ever but
rising regulatory costs threaten to undermine this important
role. With the total cost of regulations equal to an estimated
$1.75 trillion, this has become a real headwind that small
businesses face day-to-day.
Over time, this burden has grown, regardless of the
political stripes of the White House. Recent research shows
that between 2004 and 2008, the cost of regulation rose from
$12,000 per U.S. household to $16,000. Many of these costs have
come from major regulations and there were 72 between 2001 and
2008, while there were 32 in 2008-2009. While benefits far
exceeded costs each year for these major rules, this is no
excuse to avoid reducing this cost further. With the weight of
compliance continuing to rise, it will take substantial efforts
from all those involved to ease this impact.
One such way to minimize this burden is to ensure that
regulations are reviewed after they have been in force for
several years. This makes sense because it is nearly impossible
to understand how a particular rule will fully impact society
at the time it becomes final. Such retrospective examinations
are critical to reducing compliance costs, while ensuring that
a regulations benefit is still realized.
Over the last 30 years, the efforts have been far and wide
to impose a workable and successful regulatory look back
process. Presidents from Carter through Bush have called for
reviews of existing regulations. At the same time, Congress
passed the Regulatory Flexibility Act in 1980, giving small
businesses greater influence in the regulatory process. In
Section 610, the RFA also included its own periodic review
process.
While these efforts have produced some positive results,
regulatory costs have continued to grow annually. This year an
additional tool was put forth to deal with this issue.
Executive Order 13,563 required agencies to produce a plan to
review existing regulations with a particular focus on
promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job
creation. For many agencies, the level of public engagement in
the development of these strategies was impressive, culminating
in their release last month.
Many of these plans were far-reaching and include noble
approaches to reducing regulatory burden. However, it is
important for everyone in the room to realize that many of
these suggestions require investment from the government to
implement a technology-based system or change complex reporting
processes. That means reducing the compliance burden for the
private sector entails higher costs for the public sector and
the taxpayers who foot the bill.
In addition, a plan is only as good as its execution. Given
past failures and loopholes in the review of existing
regulations, I think we are all interested in how it will be
different this time. With no real consequences for agency
inaction, many of these plans may end up being pipedreams that
do little but collect dust on the shelves. Irrespective of
these concerns, reducing burden is a laudable, if elusive,
goal. It is something that we all must work toward and
constantly improve as the regulatory environment evolves. With
this in mind, I look forward to hearing from the OIRA
administrator and I thank him for being here today.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Graves. I will now introduce the Honorable Cass
Sunstein, who is the administrator of the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and
Budget. He is the official responsible for oversight of the
President's regulatory agenda and agency compliance with
Executive Order 13,563.
Mr. Sunstein, your written statement will be entered into
the record and you may proceed. And you have all the time you
want.

STATEMENT OF CASS SUNSTEIN, ADMINISTRATOR, OFFICE
OF INFORMATION AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND
BUDGET

Mr. Sunstein. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Ms. Velazquez. Mr. Chairman, I just would like to make an
inquiry.
Chairman Graves. Sure.
Ms. Velazquez. I feel that part of the agreement for him to
be here today was that you will sing him Happy Birthday.
Chairman Graves. Is today his birthday?
Ms. Velazquez. Yes.
Chairman Graves. Do you want to lead that?
Ms. Velazquez. No.
Chairman Graves. Administrator, I'll tell you what, we'll
wish you an official Happy Birthday and enter that into the
record as well.

STATEMENT OF CASS SUNSTEIN

Mr. Sunstein. Thank you very much for that. I had almost
forgotten myself that it was my birthday and I'm grateful to be
reminded that 29 years ago today something happened. Maybe not
my birthday.
It is, birthday or no birthday, an honor to be here. And
this is the perfect occasion for this. I have been looking
forward to this discussion greatly because of the current
economic situation and the opportunities that we have.
In light of the Executive Order to which both of you
referred, we have been able to make a lot of progress in a
relatively short time to eliminate unjustified regulatory costs
imposed on small businesses. In the future we are hoping to do
a great deal more and we are expecting to be able to achieve
that.
Section 6 of the new Executive Order calls for the
development of agency plans to reduce burdens in general. And
one of our particular emphases has been on small business in
the last months. Last May, agencies released over two dozen
preliminary plans, and this is the first time that a president
has actually had the plans go out to the public, including to
the business community for their scrutiny and review. What the
agencies did in releasing the plans was very publicly to ask
small business, large business individuals about existing
burdens and to help identify ways to ratchet up the burden
reduction effort.
As noted by the ranking member, last month over 2,000
agencies released their preliminary plans. They span over 805
pages. This could be a book, though we will not publish it in
order to ensure compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act. We
are keeping it online. They include over 500 initiatives that
will simplify the system and eliminate redundancy and
inconsistency.
What I would like to emphasize is that as the plans
demonstrate, a lot has already been achieved. These are not
just promissory notes. They are initiatives that have been
finalized or publicly proposed from just a handful of agencies
that are expected to save over $6 billion over the next five
years. That is a down payment. It is not enough but it is very
far from trivial.
A final ruling from the Department of Health and Human
Services reduces costs and improves access to care in rural
areas by permitting hospitals to use telemedicine to obtain
services from practitioners credentialed at distant hospitals.
This is going to save money, including for small businesses
that depend on or actually operate hospitals, and it is also
going to help patients.
The Department of Labor in an initiative that was
particularly welcomed by the business community--in fact in my
own communications with people in the business community there
was a degree of astonishment that this actually happened--the
Department of Labor finalized, didn't propose, finalized a rule
eliminating nearly two million annual burden hours imposed on
employers. It is going to save hundreds of millions of dollars
over the next five years.
The EPA finalized, finally--the small business community
had been urging this for a long time--finalized, finally, a
rule excluding all milk and milk product containers from its
oil spill rules. This is going to save $700 million over the
next five years.
The relevant reforms, as even a glance at the plan
suggests, span a wide range. What we heard in our outreach to
the small business community is that many are burdened by
paperwork and reporting requirements that turn out in theory to
be innocuous and helpful, but on the ground in practice, as the
ranking member suggested, to be a hardship and sometimes
incomprehensible. Many of our other initiatives are eliminating
redundancy or regulatory burdens that just aren't justified
anymore.
The Department of Defense recently issued----this is
finalizing a new rule to accelerate payments on contracts to as
many as 60,000 small businesses, improving their cash flow in
an economically difficult time, to help small business
borrowers who are struggling, many of them. The Small Business
Administration is adopting a new electronic application to
reduce the paperwork burden now imposed on certain lenders.
That is going to help borrowers who seek small amounts of
capital to grow and to succeed.
I would like to draw attention in particular to the plan of
the Department of Transportation, which lists over two dozen
reforms specifically tailored to impositions on small business
with an effort to relieve them of existing burdens. Every
single one of the plans recognizes that this lookback
enterprise is not a one-shot endeavor. What I am particularly
excited about is that the plans encode the creation of teams or
frameworks or working groups ensuring that there is a listening
process that is ongoing. If the plans do not have initiatives
that should be included, then we are all ears. We want to see
what would be a good way of reducing burdens now, and the
agencies are available to hear the concerns. I would like to be
cc'd on any suggestions for additions.
Many people have expressed concern with the flow of new
rules, not just the existing stock of rules. And I can give you
some details about things we have done in the recent past to
get a good control on the stock. There was a reference both the
chairman and the ranking member made to the President's January
18th memo on small business, which not only reflects the
Regulatory Flexibility Act. In important ways it goes beyond it
and imposes requirements that are supplemental that are already
helping to reduce the flow of new rules.
What the President said in January of this year is, `` We
can make our economy stronger and more competitive while
meeting our fundamental responsibilities to one another.'' We
are going to continue to eliminate unjustified regulatory
costs--this process has just started--and thus strengthen our
economy in an economically challenging time.
Thank you so much, and I am much looking forward to your
questions.
[The statement of Mr. Sunstein follows on page 24.]
Chairman Graves. Thank you, Administrator. I am going to
open up with Representative West.
Mr. West. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and also Madam Ranking
Member and Honorable Cass Sunstein. It is a pleasure to have
you here today.
One of my concerns is we have had many people come here,
especially from the Office of Advocacy, and testify that their
greatest concern is that they are getting backdoored by the
federal government as far as implementing a lot of new
regulations. One of the things that I am concerned about is
there are approximately 4,300 regulatory actions that are
waiting in the pipeline right now, and 219 of those are
considered economically significant, meaning they can have more
than $100 million of impact on our private sector, especially
on small businesses.
The number one thing when we go back and we talk to the
people down on the ground is the regulatory environment and
especially when you talk to small banks, community banks with
Dodd-Frank and a lot of the means by which they have been
caught in there, can you really tell us and give us an
understanding of what the federal government is doing to not
allow the agencies to do--I call it behavior modification
through regulation. What they could not get through the
legislative process it seems they are doing through the
regulatory process. So can you kind of lay out the plan that
you all have?
Mr. Sunstein. Great. The first point is that anything that
is done by the Executive Branch has to comply with the law and
within the boundaries that you set out. Article 1, that is
legislative power in the Congress of the United States. That is
the first substantive sentence in the Constitution. The
executive----
Mr. West. But let me interrupt you. I will give you a great
example. Numeric nutrient criteria, which is something that the
EPA sent down, I don't think anyone up here, you know, there is
no law that, you know, complies with that. And that is
something that the EPA has instituted. And as a matter of fact,
in the state of Florida there is a lawsuit that is being
brought against the state when it comes to that. So.
Mr. Sunstein [continuing]. Okay. The big numeric criteria
rule from EPA was numeric limits for stormwater. And that--I
don't know if you saw EPA actually withdrew it in a way that
produced a great deal of applause from the National
Homebuilders saying this is a great thing for the economy, for
people who want to buy homes, and for people who build homes.
It was completely withdrawn.
Mr. West. But not for farmers.
Mr. Sunstein. No, it was completely withdrawn for
everybody. The stormwater rule was completely withdrawn.
Mr. West. Okay.
Mr. Sunstein. I can give you a bunch of other examples of
cases where we are all working together to address the problem
that you mentioned. Winslow Sargeant, who is the chief
consulate of the SBA, is a close partner. His February 2010
report emphasizes the big impact and the growing impact that
SBA has been having on federal rule-making. It applauds the
trend line. And since then, or contemporaneous to then, a
number of things have happened. You may have noticed just a few
days ago the Department of Labor withdrew its very
controversial fiduciary rule. That was a rule that got a lot of
concern from members of the House and also from the small
business community. That has been withdrawn. They are going to
re-propose that.
The Department of Labor also had a rule involving
musculoskeletal disorders, a new reporting rule, where the
Office of Advocacy and the small business community were both
very troubled. They did not know what it meant. What is a
musculoskeletal disorder? And they thought that it would be
burdensome. Are they going to have to hire doctors to test all
of their employees who have back pain? That one was withdrawn.
And the Department of Labor is working well with SBA. There was
a noise interpretation from OSHA that the small business
community was very concerned about just this year. OSHA
withdrew that one also.
So the number of rules that are being carefully
reconsidered by--I have given you four examples just now. I
could multiply that by three if you like. In response to the
current economic situation and the very clear direction the
president has given me and all of us to make sure that what we
are doing on the regulatory side is consistent with the
economic recovery. If there are other areas where we are not
being sufficiently responsive, gosh, I would love to hear it
because this is the time.
Mr. West. Okay. The last question that follows along with
that, you know, right now it looks like we are on a track to
have full-time regulatory employees expected to reach a level
of 291,676. Is there a way that we can freeze the hiring of new
regulatory employees?
Mr. Sunstein. Well, that is your lane and mine is the
implementation job. I work at the Office of Management and
Budget but the budget, the B-side, is not something that I am
directly involved in. I can tell you, you referred to the 219
economically significant rules so called in the pipeline. The
number is a little confusing because these are things that are
under general contemplation by the agencies. They are not in
the pipeline. They are not pending. They are not proposed. They
are kind of like--as if there is a law that one of you is
thinking about and you give a heads-up to the public. It does
not mean it is going to come. And I can assure you those 219
are not going to see the light of day unless they can pass very
careful scrutiny in terms of the new direction the president is
giving us this year.
Mr. West. Thank you very much. And I yield back, Mr.
Chairman.
Chairman Graves. Ms. Velazquez.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome,
Administrator.
We have been here before and from Carter on, everyone has
checked that list on regulation and impact on small businesses.
What would you tell the Committee this time it is going to be
different? And how would you get the 26 federal agencies to get
with this issue in a way that produced the results that are
expected, especially at this time when we are facing this
economic downturn?
Mr. Sunstein. Okay. The first thing that we have done that
no previous president did was to have public plans that
actually have concrete details with schedules and timelines in
many cases for taking action. So I actually had the privilege
of working in the Reagan Administration. I was six years old at
the time, as you can tell from earlier. But in the Reagan
Administration there was a very firm effort to discipline
regulatory burdens. And he deserves a lot of credit for that.
He did not have a sustained lookback effort to this sort.
President Bush had an effort in the domain of manufacturing,
but the agencies did not come up with plans.
So the fact that there are plans with timelines promotes
accountability. What we are doing on our side is not just
having, you know, plans and aspirations but trying actually to
take action. So there are things that have been done by the
Department of Transportation, taking hundreds of millions of
costs away and a proposed rule just a while ago. The Department
of Health and Human Services is going to try to free up
hospitals and doctors from regulatory requirements that have
not been revisited. That is a $600 million annual savings that
is well beyond the planned stage. That is actually a rule under
review and that is no secret here. That is a rule under review
at OIRA today.
The Environmental Protection Agency has finalized rules.
This is not just a wish list. And what we are trying to develop
is fast track procedures for the cost reduction initiatives
that we see on the plans. So some of them have actually been
proposed, some of these things, which means they are going to
be finalized in the relatively near future. Others already have
been finalized. And if you see things that you really like on
the plans--maybe they are the export initiatives, some of which
have been finalized proposed--please let us know if they really
have an impact. And then we can see if we can do them quickly.
Ms. Velazquez. Would you have a mechanism in place to
evaluate the work of the federal agencies?
Mr. Sunstein. Yeah. We do. We have an informal process in
my office where we are very alert to the 500 reforms on the
plans and looking carefully at what stage each of them is at.
And so the ones that are proposed, like the Department of
Transportation rule which eliminates hundreds of millions of
dollars and costs, we are looking to see how quickly that can
go. There is an OSHA rule that is going to eliminate over $500
million in annual costs. That one has been proposed. We are
looking to see if we can finalize that pretty quickly.
And for everything on the 800 pages that looks really
promising, we are engaged in an ongoing monitoring exercise. It
is a little lonely, so if you would like to join us and help
monitor and expedite, that would be very welcome.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you.
Agencies reach out to the public in particularly innovative
ways. And you mentioned some of those like EPA held 20 public
meetings, as well as participating in the Department of
Transportation's meeting where participants could attend those
meetings over the Internet. The Department of Labor designed a
website that permitted participants to post suggestions,
respond to other posts, and agree or disagree with submissions.
It seems that those agencies that had low public participation
rates could benefit from those ideas. And so are you
considering sharing these outreach strategies across agencies?
Mr. Sunstein. Yes. What we encourage them all to do--we had
some guidance documents during the initial phases of the
lookback process where we encouraged everyone to engage the
public because as you said, often the people who are faced by
rules and burdened by them have the best insights about how
they are adversely affecting operations. So we have encouraged
public outreach. We have tended to the fact that a number of
agencies--and this also is new. For all their good work, prior
presidents did nothing like this--have websites that are
specifically dedicated to business outreach to see how we can
simplify and streamline the regulatory process. Those are
ongoing. And we have encouraged agencies to follow the model
that several agencies, including the Department of
Transportation and EPA, have.
What I am very hopeful about is that there is a cultural
change, which was started within the agencies, where each of
them has either a formal or an incipient institution that is
particularly dedicated to eliminating regulatory burdens. And
they might be burdens that have been in place for 30 years.
They might be burdens that have been in place for a couple of
months and that just are causing unintended or unexpected harm.
And maybe that can be fixed quickly.
Ms. Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Graves. Mr. Bartlett.
Mr. Bartlett. Thank you very much.
In a former life as a small business person and now nearly
20 years in the Congress, I have been watching the creation and
the application of these rules and regulations. And I have
noted a phenomenon that results in increased regulations, and I
am wondering if you have a solution to this problem.
Initially, very rational, simple rules and regulations are
enacted, and then when they are used, applied, some modest
deviation from the intended response of the regulated is
observed. And the usual response to that is more regulations.
We do not want that to happen again, do we? And frequently
these increased regulations pass over the line of the
rationable and/or reasonable, and there appears to be no
attempt to do a cost benefit analysis. Is the benefit we might
get from these increased regulations really going to be
justified by the economic effects and just the harassment of
the poor business trying to succeed in a tough economic
environment? How can we get our people to do a rational cost
benefit analysis? The old farmer says why would you do it if
the juice is not worth the squeezing? For many of these
increased regulations, the juice is not worth the squeezing.
Mr. Sunstein. Great. What President Reagan inaugurated in
the early '80s was cost benefit analysis as a test for
regulatory proposals and final rules. President Obama had a
very clear embrace of cost benefit analysis in his executive
order this past January. And we are taking cost benefit
analysis extremely seriously. I do not believe you will see a
single rule issued in the last eight months that fails cost
benefit analysis, and you will see very few in the last two and
a half years. I think there is only one that clearly fails cost
benefit analysis and that one was a congressional mandate on
safety on trains. And we did the best we could to reduce costs.
As noted, you could have a rule that survives cost benefit
analysis but still the costs are too high. It could have higher
net benefit if you scaled the costs back. But basically, the
president has given us extremely clear guidance on following
cost benefit analysis, and we are responding to his direction.
You may have noticed--this has got a lot of attention--the
president directed me to issue a return letter on the EPA's
draft ozone rule. The bulk of that return letter was
emphasizing some very specific points that bore on the rule in
particular, but the next to last paragraph emphasized more
generally apart from the ozone rule. The president has directed
me to take strong steps to diminish regulatory costs and to
make sure they were really justified going forward.
And that commitment to cost benefit analysis you will see
in every rule we have issued so far. You will see it in the
reconsideration of certain rules. The fiduciary rule, which was
of very grave concern to a number of businesses, would expand
the definition of fiduciary. It had some--well, I think what
everyone agrees are some strong, well motivated arguments in
it. But it was not really ready yet and the Department of Labor
said we are going to do a new analysis, analyze the costs and
benefits, and see what really the best proposal would be. And
it is not identical to what they originally proposed.
But the examples I gave are rules that have been taken
back, are frequently taken back in order to get the analysis of
costs and benefits as accurate as possible. And one of the most
important parts of the new executive order says agencies are
not supposed to proceed unless there is a reasoned
determination that the benefits justify the costs.
Mr. Bartlett. How could you have even in the back of your
mind this notion that there ought to be a cost benefit analysis
and the side that spilled milk was an oil spill? Is that an
anomaly that will not happen again?
Mr. Sunstein. Well, that was not the--I am pleased to say
that that was not a government regulation. That was a statute
and it was an old statute.
Mr. Bartlett. It was our fault? We did that?
Mr. Sunstein. No one in this room had anything to do with
it.
Mr. Bartlett. But we, the Congress, did that?
Mr. Sunstein. Yes. That is correct.
Mr. Bartlett. Oh, my.
Mr. Sunstein. It was----
Mr. Bartlett. Please help us to keep from doing dumb
things.
Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.
Mr. Sunstein [continuing]. I don't think anyone intended to
include milk. It was an artifact of the definition.
Well, there is some fat in milk and that is in oil.
Mr. Bartlett. You got it.
Mr. Sunstein. It was a stretch, isn't it?
Mr. Bartlett. Exactly. But you gave us a chance to fix it
and we did.
Chairman Graves. Ms. Clarke.
Ms. Clarke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member
Velazquez.
I want to thank you, Administrator Sunstein--Sunstein or
Stine?
Mr. Sunstein. Sunstein.
Ms. Clarke. Got it.
We are from New York. Well, I am from New York. So is the
ranking member, so we just wanted to get that correct.
Clearly, we recognize the need to streamline regulatory
obligations, especially when and if they interfere with the
viability of the small business community.
And just sort of picking up on Mr. Bartlett's train of
thought, I wanted to ask could you briefly explain or distil,
if you will, your cost benefit--excuse me, the rubric, the
general rubric used to--through your cost benefit analysis to
determine what costs, whatever they may be, outweigh the
benefits or the benefits outweigh the burdens?
Mr. Sunstein. Okay. Thank you for that. That is fundamental
to what we are trying to do. Sometimes we will have a rule that
will impose costs, let's say, on companies that have to adopt
certain management practices to ensure that people are not
going to get salmonella from their eggs. Okay? And that maybe
we will be able to have a cost estimate that industry will be
informative on. And we might find that it is going to cost,
let's suppose, $100,000 a year, in which case it is
economically significant.
If it is going to cost $100 million a year, we need a full-
born regulatory impact analysis as it is called, which gets a
full account of the costs and the benefits.
Now, if it is going to involve salmonella, let's say, it is
going to prevent a certain number of diseases in a case of one
rule we had, which incidentally exempted small business because
they were not the problem.
It is going to cause a certain--prevent a certain number of
deaths from salmonella food poisoning, and it is going to cause
a certain number of diseases averted. Economists have some
tools for giving an economic value to the diseases averted and
the mortalities avoided. And there is something a little, you
know, a little mechanical, maybe, about turning diseases and
lives into dollar amounts. But if you do not do that then you
might be spending a zillion dollars for something that is
actually a low level risk. So these are tools that are used.
In cases that are sometimes a bit easier we will have a
rule, like the milk rule, which will eliminate costs or save
people money, and then you don't have to do any translation of
health problem into dollar equivalents; you will just have
dollars. And so for some of our deregulatory initiatives, some
of our initiatives that involve saving consumers money from
various rules that reduce the costs they face, then it is
dollars. And what we try to do is do our best techniques for
turning all the benefits into dollar equivalents. The president
has called for quantification in ways that have gone beyond
even what President Reagan did. If we have something where the
costs are higher than the benefits, let's say it is going to
cost $100 million and the best account of the benefits is it is
$50 million, that is a really serious problem. And we are going
to try to work on that rule to get those $100 million costs
down to $40 million. Then the benefits will justify the costs.
But as the ranking member suggested, it may be that that $40
million is too high and you can get the same, let's say, health
benefit for $30 million or $10 million.
And so a lot of our time is spent seeing ways to achieve
the same goal less expensively. And you have seen in the last
eight months a number of rules where the agencies have gone
forward but the final rule was far less burdensome than the
proposed rule. And one reason is typically that the small
business community will say, ``What are you doing here?'' So
there was an EPA rule involving lead renovation for homes where
kids can get, you know, sick if the lead levels are high. The
small business community, including the Office of Advocacy,
said you have some--it is called a `` dust white'' procedure,
which is really expensive and it is not worth it given the
relatively marginal, as the EPA ultimately concluded, health
benefits of that procedure. So the EPA took it away. And the
small business community said now you have something that we
can work with. And that is an example of where cost reduction,
as part of cost benefit analysis, can lead to a rule that's
economically maybe more rational.
Chairman Graves. Mr. Hanna. Mr. Tipton.
Mr. Tipton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member.
Appreciate you being here.
Mr. Sunstein. Thank you.
Mr. Tipton. You know, I was just out in Colorado. We held a
Small Business Subcommittee Hearing, and the constant rejoinder
that we heard through that was government regulation. It was
not a stepping stone to success and to be able to create jobs
but it was a stumbling block. In fact, you may have seen this
report just came out, recent study, and it's showing that the
regulatory burden on the American people cost approximately
$1.75 trillion annually. That's with full knowledge. We need
some regulations. But the overreach of this, when we get this
down to actual dollars, when we're talking about creating jobs
which is something that the president has indicated that he is
in favor of--I am certainly in favor of doing--is we are seeing
$160,000 each year that businesses are having to pay for
regulatory costs. When we distill that down to small businesses
according to this report, each employee--each employee of the
business is having to pay $10,585 for regulatory costs per
employee. This must stop. We are, and I truly respect your
comment of trying to clean it up and maybe we really need some
legislation because when you're talking about President Reagan,
you're talking about President Obama, we're actually looking at
executive orders as opposed to legislative direction that is
coming out.
But I do have a question. Reading through your testimony, I
want to go back actually to the milk regulations that you had
brought up. I am very curious because you state that, and this
perplexes me, that the EPA estimates--you noted this was a law
and you just clarified with the regulation--but you further
stated that this milk exemption will actually save our economy
over $700 million over the next five years. How can we save
what we never spent, what was never incorporated?
Mr. Sunstein. Okay. There are a lot of great points there
so let me say a little bit.
In terms of the report, the $1.75 trillion report, the
general concern that regulatory costs on small business and the
economy are too high and that we should be doing a lot to
reduce those costs, I agree with completely. That $1.75
trillion figure is in the nature of an urban legend as a report
by the Congressional Research Service recently laid out. It is
based on an assumption, some analysis of a World Bank study
that confuses regulatory quality and regulatory stringency. And
if the study is right, then the U.S. GDP would be higher if we
had a regulatory system like Sweden and Canada. I do not think
anybody thinks that is true. So the $1.75 trillion probably to
say it should be treated with a grain of salt is too weak; it
should be treated as, you know, not a reliable number.
Having said that, the general thrust of your question I
completely agree with. On the milk rule, what happened was
there was a formal requirement in the law that the milk
producers be subject to this oil spill rule. And we had heard,
as the Bush Administration had heard from the agricultural
community, this is a looming, serious problem for us.
Enforcement, as I understand it, of the requirements of the
milk producers was weak for understandable reasons. It just
didn't make much sense. But no one had taken care of the
problem, and this was a very significant cost.
Mr. Tipton. How does that still save $700 million? It was
never spent. That is the claim that you were making.
Mr. Sunstein. Because it was a regulatory requirement
imposed on them that would have imposed burdens.
Mr. Tipton. Would have, but it was not. So how are we
claiming $700 million in savings?
Mr. Sunstein. No, it would have in the sense that the
formal law required it. And if we had not done anything about
it, under the formal law----
Mr. Tipton. So it is really--and when we are talking about
an urban legend, the $700 million in savings is actually a mute
point.
Mr. Sunstein [continuing]. No. That is an accurate number.
And the agricultural community, which celebrated with great
enthusiasm, what the EPA did to take away that cost----
Mr. Tipton. No. I applaud it.
Mr. Sunstein [continuing]. Did not deny that the cost was
taken away. They had worked for years to get the cost taken
away. You are right in one sense. The cost--the requirement of
the law was not being enforced. So what it was meaning on the
ground is a reasonable question to ask. Nonetheless, the
industry's own plea, and ultimately very enthusiastic reaction,
is suggestive that there was a problem that needed to be
solved. I can say while the Bush Administration commendably
started the effort that we completed, our final rule is
actually significantly more deregulatory than the Bush
proposal.
Mr. Tipton. We are running out of time but I know you have
a complex job but we are looking at 3,573 new final rules and
you are talking about the complexity of you and it is your job
keeping up with it. How in the world can small business keep up
with this? Because we are creating uncertainty.
Mr. Sunstein. I completely agree that is the problem. Three
thousand, five hundred seventy-three new final rules. I wonder
where that comes from. In the last two and a half years the
rules that have been through my office are not that numerous.
In fact, we have finalized fewer rules in our first two years
than the Bush Administration did on average in its eight.
Nonetheless, the concern that there should be great care and a
reduction in regulatory complexity uncertainty, that is
something the president has directed us to do. And I would love
to get your ideas about how we can make the lookback process as
effective and full as it can possibly be.
Mr. Tipton. Mr. Chairman, I yield back time I do not have.
Chairman Graves. Mr. Owens.
Mr. Owens. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Sunstein, thank you
for testifying today.
If you could just walk through with me the process that a
small business goes through in communicating to your office an
issue related to a regulation, I think that would be very
helpful.
Mr. Sunstein. Okay, great. What we have available now, this
is actually one of the first things we did, was to create on a
website called reginfo.gov, complete visibility into what rules
are now before the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs. So this to my dismay is not the most popular website
on the Internet, reginfo.gov, but I wish it would be very
popular for small businesses because if there is any rule that
is with us, they can see immediately.
Now, that gives two opportunities for them to communicate
with us. One is a letter to Yours Truly is going to be read
very carefully. And if it refers to concerns that the small
business community has about a rule under review, I can assure
you it is going to be read very carefully in view of the fact
that small businesses are the principal job creators in the
country. In fact, in our data call as it is described to the
agencies asking them to tell us what they are contemplating for
the next year, we, this past summer, asked them specifically to
call out and list separately whatever they are doing that would
have an effect on small business. So we are available by letter
with respect to anything.
But we are doing better than that actually in availability,
and I do not think this is widely known. I wish it would be. If
any member of the small business community wants to talk to us
about a rule under review, our doors are open. We have 100
percent availability. If people want to come and tell us that
this rule is trouble, maybe it has been proposed and there are
concerns about it, maybe people do not want it to be proposed
because they think the very proposal will create uncertainty,
to the congressman's point just a moment ago, we are available.
And my staff is--in these meetings they are called not so
charmingly, 12866 meetings under the executive order that makes
them possible. People can come in. And if there is a legitimate
concern as there not infrequently is, it is really going to be
given attention. And that mechanism of face-to-face contact, I
think it is insufficiently understood that it is there. The
agency, by the way that is in support of the rule, will be
there, too. And not infrequently the agency will say, oh, this
is going to have this adverse effect; maybe we can change the
rule so that it achieves its goal without having that adverse
effect.
Mr. Owens. Thanks. You indicated that your website may not
be the most popular on the Internet. Do you have an
approximation of the number of hits you get on a weekly or
monthly basis?
Mr. Sunstein. It is a lot. I do not have it in my head but
we would be happy to get that to you. I can tell you one thing
we noticed was when we went to a somewhat technical
presentation to this very clear graphical presentation where
you just see colors and it says EPA and it will have the
number. HHS, it will have the number. Small Business
Administration has a number. You can click on it and see every
rule that they have before my office. The numbers spiked. We
saw a very significant spike in usage.
Mr. Owens. Is there an average lag time between the
enactment of legislation and the enactment of a rule
interpreting the legislation?
Mr. Sunstein. I am sure there is. It would vary depending
on whether there is a statutory deadline. So when there is
legislation that says we have to do something by a certain
date, that is taken really seriously. Every time we have a rule
that comes before us that has a statutory deadline, that is one
of the first questions we ask.
Mr. Owens. Understand.
Mr. Sunstein. So our average review time is about 51 days,
roughly. That is part of the lag but because rules typically
are proposed and then finalized, a number of months. Of course,
the urgency of the problem really matters. So if it is
something where life is at stake, then the likelihood of a
relatively prompt rule increases.
Mr. Owens. Thank you very much. I yield back.
Chairman Graves. I am going to jump in here for a second
because you are painting a picture that we are seeing less and
less regulations actually being passed. But to get very
parochial for just a second, when it comes to the FAA, and some
of this has security aspects, but you have got the Large
Aircraft Security Proposal being put out there; you have got
the BART Program being eliminated by the Department of
Transportation; you have got security badges in general
aviation at airports that security is not an issue; you have
got aircraft certification standards that are changing all the
time; you have got airworthiness standards that are changing
for aircraft or being proposed to be changed considerably which
will hamper operators and air shows in a big way; you have got
letter of authorization changes for certification for pilots to
be able to fly these aircraft; you have got fuel issue changes
that are happening from the EPA. And that is coming down hard
and fast and there are lots and lots of regulations out there.
And I see nothing but proliferation of regulations when it
comes to aircraft and flying. And it is concerning the aviation
community in a huge way because it can cripple that industry in
a huge way. And that is one area that the United States is
blowing everybody else around the world out when it comes to
exports and when it comes to production, when it comes to an
entire industry, but I would be real interested on your
comments there.
Mr. Sunstein. I do agree that there are some sectors that
are facing cumulative burdens that are not welcome, and there
are other sectors that are facing overlapping redundant or
inconsistent burdens which can cause a real hardship. And in
the area you are describing in particular, I do not know what
the trendline is for the volume of rules over, let's say, the
last eight years, but I do know that there is an acute concern
about what you exactly said. And we are working really hard to
try to make sure that the problem of cumulative burdens
inconsistency is addressed.
If there are particular rules that you think have been
issued in the recent or even distant past that are not worth
it, that is a terrific candidate for inclusion in DOT's
lookback plan. And in fact, if you look at DOT's plan you will
see the FAA has some very promising candidates. And if you see
rules coming down the pike that ought not to be issued in your
view or that ought to be issued in a way that meshes better
with other rules or ought to be harmonized to use the word of
the president's executive order, we would love some help on
that.
I would not want to say that the, you know, anything
general about a diminution of rulemaking on the airline
industry. Every single one has to pass a series of filters. All
I wanted to say with respect to the volume of rules is that the
number of final economically significant rules in the first
years of the Obama Administration--this is not widely known--
but it is actually lower than the preceding two years and lower
than the average under President Bush. That is not to say that
we have the right level of rules. And one of our principal
goals these days is to reduce regulatory costs. So the $6
billion over the next five years is a down payment but we hope
to be able to do a lot better than that in reducing regulatory
costs. And on the airline industry in particular, that is
something we are looking very carefully at.
Chairman Graves. Well, all of these aspects that--or these
areas that I put out do not have anything to do with the
airline industry; it is all about general aviation, which is
going to have a huge--again, a huge impact. And what we are
finding from, whether it is the Department of Transportation or
it is the FAA, which is a division of the Department of
Transportation or even the EPA, we are not getting any interest
in listening to our concerns. They are moving forward and not
going to take the concerns into account and that is very
frustrating for me. And it is not just this Administration; it
has happened in other administrations. And they are not
interested in listening. And that is very frustrating,
particularly when you have an industry that could be impacted
as greatly as general aviation. And again, that is--every bit
of this has to do with GA. And when I say GA, I am talking
about business aviation all the way down to your weekend flyer.
And every business that is associated with that around the
airport and in those companies that are in those business parks
and everything else, it is going to have huge impacts.
Mr. Sunstein. Okay. I hear you, Mr. Chairman. If you would
write me or write the FAA and cc me, I promise you, you are
going to get our attention. You know, the EPA withdrew its
stormwater rule. It decided it had to reconsider it. The Labor
Department withdrew its fiduciary rule. We have a bunch of
things that have been rethought in the recent past and if there
is something that is not thought through very well we will get
a handle on it.
Chairman Graves. Ms. Herrera Beutler.
Ms. Herrera Beutler. Thank you, Mr. Sunstein. I appreciate
your time. I have a couple things I want to get to so we will
have to be a little brief.
Generally, what rule does congressional review play in your
decision-making process? For instance, Congressman Schrader and
I, a congressman from Oregon, introduced a bill that exempts
certain force activities from being regulated essentially like
an industrial type. You have a private forest, we do not
believe you should have to get the same permits that an
industrial site would have to get to operate. Right? In the
Pacific Northwest we have lots of water rules.
So for 35 years that is how EPA has looked at this. They
are now moving to regulate it, and rules like that cost jobs,
especially, again, in the Pacific Northwest where we have
hundreds of thousands of dollars in jobs on the line when it
comes to our forest economy. Will legislation like this and the
tremendous amount of support it has received from labor, from
business, be taken into consideration in your review process?
Mr. Sunstein. The law is authoritative. So if that law is
enacted, that is it. New trumps everything. So the legal
constraints on regulatory action, that is a trump card.
Ms. Herrera Beutler. So would your office be willing to
help promote this or at least be favorable as we work it
through the process?
Mr. Sunstein. When the lane--the Office of Information
Regulatory Affairs has a narrow lane which is implementation,
we do not get involved in what legislation the administration
supports, or if we do it is--we play a very modest role in
that. So there are others at OMB who would have the lead on
that.
Ms. Herrera Beutler. Okay. Well, we would like the chance
to submit for your consideration and possibly if you need to
move it up or down or laterally we would love to have your help
in that.
Mr. Sunstein. I can get you in touch with the right people.
Ms. Herrera Beutler. With that, and I do applaud the
president's decision to again--he said it in the State of the
Union, he made the case about a week ago, two weeks ago now--
that he wants to review and I think it is incredibly important.
One of the things I would like to have you consider, it is not
just not implementing a rule. In many cases it is the
indefinite delay that is causing a problem. You know, I think
of certain things. I think of Boilermate. I think of others.
Yes, we are glad that the job-killing rule did not go into
place, that is good. But then sitting on it for three years, or
what have you, causes business to continue to constrict. I
mean, the uncertainty is just as deadly as the rule itself
would be. And you said--we were talking about general
contemplation. When you kind of put out there that you are
thinking of something, it has that same paralytic effect. We do
not actually float that we are going to release bills that we
really do not have the intention, or at least the more cautious
legislators do not do that because we know it will have an
impact just floating the idea. And so I would ask as you are
considering these things, do not float something that you--just
because it is not in the pipeline does not mean that it is not
going to add to the uncertainty that our small business owners
are feeling.
Mr. Sunstein. You are clearly right that there is a
tradeoff between transparency--this is under consideration--and
adverse effect.
Ms. Herrera Beutler. Now, if you are going to be taking
action, it is different than general contemplation. Like, there
is an issue we would like to consider versus, hey, maybe we
will add another, you know, person on--like you do not have
enough to do.
Mr. Sunstein. I appreciate the concern and we are--we are
going to see what we can do on this.
Ms. Herrera Beutler. With that, a couple more things. You
know, I know the executive order requires agencies to review
regulations. What is their timeframe or required reporting
process? Do they report back to you at a certain time? Is this
a general ongoing thing?
Mr. Sunstein. Okay, great. So what the executive order
required was within 120 days they had to submit to the public
really preliminary plans. And as noted, before they did that
actually with our encouragement, they had public meetings,
websites, engagement, or what should be on the preliminary
plans. That happened in May. Then they had another 80 days to
finalize the plans. And so in late August, August 22nd, I think
it was, they issued final plans to the public. Every single one
of the plans says that this is an ongoing process and that the
plans can be supplemented if there are new ideas. What we are
focused on now is taking those of the 500 reforms that are
particularly promising and well enough along that we can
expedite them and get them out and deliver some relief.
We calculate up to $10 billion in monetizable savings over
the next five years from a small subset of the reforms where
monetization is possible. We would like to see progress on
those, finalization of those in the near future.
Ms. Herrera Beutler. Great. And one final parting thought.
As you are doing that we want to help. You offered several
times. If you want help, go ahead and kick those things to
Congress for an up or down vote and we will let you know
whether you think moving forward you are on track.
Mr. Sunstein. And thank you for that.
Ms. Herrera Beutler. You asked, so we are offering.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Graves. Ms. Ellmers.
Ms. Ellmers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr.
Sunstein, for being here today.
I would like to follow up on one of the comments. You had
mentioned that if any small business, small business owners,
would like to sit down with you, that your door is open to
them. You know, right now in our economy, with our unemployment
rate where it is and it is sustained, one of the things that I
have heard consistently in talking with my constituents, and I
know this goes across the country, you know, in North Carolina
and throughout, regulations are killing us is the number one
issue. Does that call to action--do you hear that? Are you
aware of that? And is that promoting you to move forward on
more things?
Mr. Sunstein. Yes. I hear that every day, not just on my
birthday, that regulations are causing problems. That is--I
think killing us is the strongest phrasing but I have heard
that a lot also. I would say if I hear that only once a day it
is an unusual day.
And because of the historic role of the Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs created in its current form
by President Reagan, that is something that we are intensely
focused on. So there are two ways that we focus on that. One is
this unprecedentedly ambitious lookback process where we are
trying to go forward with 500 reforms that will be helpful in
eliminating regulatory burdens. And the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration elimination of nearly two million burden
hours, when I've talked to the business communities, is
regulation killing us, the reaction I have gotten to that one
is you are kidding. You actually did that? You took away
reporting and paperwork burdens? That was greeted
enthusiastically. So a lot of what we are trying to do is take
away justified burdens.
The other thing we are trying to do is to make sure that
regulations going forward, which in some cases are the bulk of
the concern, have--if they are going to go forward they better
have commensurate benefits. They better be saving lives or
doing something great. And even if they are, maybe they can
accomplish the same goal more cheaply and in some cases maybe
they ought not to go forward at all.
So the fact that you have seen many of the rules, not all
to be sure, but many of the rules that have been of particular
concern to the small business community being withdrawn for
further engagement with the small business community, the most
prominent of these was the Labor Department's musculoskeletal
disorder reporting rule where the Office of Advocacy of the SBA
and the small business community in general found it confusing.
And what happened to that is it was withdrawn. There was an
EEOC rule implementing the statute that enacted the Americans
with Disabilities Act amendments which when proposed
encountered a great deal of concern from the business community
saying this is confusing, regulatory uncertainty, and
overreach. As it was finalized after a great deal of engagement
under the--with reference to the president's executive order on
regulation, the Chamber of Commerce said you heard us. It is
good. This is very reasonable. We applaud this final rule. And
that is a model where the disability community thought this was
a good implementation and the business community thought it is
okay. It is fine. That is a model that would be nice to follow.
Ms. Herrera Beutler. I have one more specific question. One
of the issues that has been brought to my attention are on
private right of actions in the regulatory agencies being
forced to overregulate for fear of lawsuits. If this were
something that were removed, do you see that this would
decrease the amount of regulation moving forward?
Mr. Sunstein. I think the answer to that is clearly yes.
Sometimes Congress likes private rights of action as a
supplement to federal regulatory actions. Sometimes Congress
hates private rights of action as a recipe for overregulation.
And sometimes Congress is neutral. So fundamentally it is in
your hands.
Ms. Herrera Beutler. Well, thank you very much. I
appreciate that. And I yield back the remainder of my time.
Chairman Graves. Ms. Velazquez.
Ms. Velazquez. No, I do not have any more questions. Thank
you.
Chairman Graves. Mr. Tipton.
Mr. Tipton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Just a couple of other questions. As I was listening to
your comments in terms of inviting us, and it goes back to
Congressman Beutler's statement as well, in terms of the
lookback that is going on, does it really--when we are hearing
about all the challenges that small businesses, in particular,
are facing, very shallow pools of money to be able to pay in
and they are paying it out for regulations, does it really make
sense to you that the only real lookback going on right now is
the same agency that created the rules?
Mr. Sunstein. Well, I take your point. The way the process
works is a little better than that, I think. The agency that is
doing the lookback per OIRA guidance actually, is strongly
encouraged to make sure that the rulemaking officials are not
the ones looking at the rules for your reason that within the
agency there is a kind of separation between the rule makers
and the rule evaluators. That is the first point.
The second point is that the lookback process has been
greatly informed, not by the agency's own soul searching but by
engagement with the public that is subject to the rules. So
there is a process you may know about called Start Up America,
and I have actually traveled myself to ask members of the small
business community what is causing problems. And a lot of the
ideas on the rules and in a number of cases this is
specifically called out, they do not come from the agencies
themselves; they come from members of the public who have said
this is causing a problem for us.
The milk one to which you referred, the source of the
concern was the agricultural industry. We have a rule
eliminating redundant air pollution control requirements
imposed on local gas stations, and the gas stations have said
this is a very good thing. So it is not just the agency's own
internal mechanism; it is also a process within the executive
branch. In some cases members of Congress have said this is
something you should look back at; this is a cause for concern.
The fiduciary rule, which has been revisited, it does not look
back in the same sense of eliminating rules on the books but it
is a lookback in the sense of reassessing a proposal. And many
members of Congress said to the Department of Labor, we are
worried about cost and benefits and unintended adverse
consequences.
Mr. Tipton. You know, I certainly went after the thought if
you want to try on something experimentally before you go
active with rules, bring them back to the Committee, and we
would take a look.
One other point that I would--we did hold a Subcommittee
hearing that I had the privilege of being able to chair and it
was in regards to the GIPSA rule. There have been three recent
studies that have been conducted showing that the costs on the
GIPSA rule will well exceed $100 million, which crosses the
threshold to have this re-examined by the agency. Are you
looking back at the GIPSA rule now?
Mr. Sunstein. Not the slightest. And the Department of
Agriculture is very much engaged in assessing costs and
benefits.
Mr. Tipton. Okay. Great. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield
back.
Chairman Graves. Mr. Hanna.
Mr. Hanna. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I am generally curious. It has been widely stated here that
rules and regulations are killing us. How do you personally
feel about that? Do you think that is a fair estimate, a fair
interpretation?
In coupling with that, how much of what is done in your
office is subjective? What type of people do this?
Mr. Sunstein. Those are great questions. Thank you.
I generally do not talk in the terms of regulations killing
us. That just would not be my preferred phrasing, but it is
extremely important in an economically hard time to reduce
unjustified regulatory costs and to make sure benefits justify
costs. Absolutely. So the fact that we are able to save
billions of dollars in regulatory costs, that is a very good
thing.
In the SBA's report in February 2010, what they said was
their own interventions have contributed to the elimination of
$14 billion in regulatory costs. That is a very good thing. So
the fact that certain rules are being reconsidered to engage
with the cost issue is really important. The President said
just a few nights ago that regulations should be issued only if
they are necessary, and that is phrasing that is orienting all
of our efforts.
So the idea of getting a hold of the regulatory process to
make sure the benefits justify the costs to scale back on
justified requirements, that is a very high priority. To get a
hold of the problem of regulatory uncertainty for small
business in particular, that is something the President has
directed all of us to pay very careful attention to.
In terms of the people at the office, there is an
extraordinary staff at the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs. They are not political. Many of them have been there
for a number of years going back across administrations. They
are typically first-rate technical analysts whose basic job is
to think what are the impacts of this rule going to be? How
much does it cost? What are the benefits? Are the costs real?
Are the benefits real? How can we do it in a way that is as
cost effective as possible? And they have been doing this work
in some cases for a couple of years and in some cases for a lot
longer than that. And they are highly professional.
Mr. Hanna. Which way would you describe the subjective
momentum of what they do in terms of regulation? Would you
suggest that--would you say that it is generally more or less
or----
Mr. Sunstein. Well, I think the goal is to be as objective
as possible. And with respect to regulation where the
anticipated cost is between let's say $100 million and $500
million, we want to get as close as we can to the objective
account. And it would not be shocking for a random regulation,
if those who were excited about it, let's say in a community
outside government think the costs are going to be lower than
we expect, and if those who are nervous about it think the
costs are going to be bigger and we work really closely with
the Council of Economic Advisors, which is an indispensible
partner in getting the economic analysis right, so I would say
that really our goal is to get the numbers right. Subjectivity
is hard to eliminate from human life but objectivity is our
goal.
Mr. Hanna. And do you think that at the end of the day it
is a pretty balanced approach and that that would be your
opinion?
Mr. Sunstein. Well, I am honored to serve with a staff of
professionals at this office, who have been under multiple
administrations, and I think they are really good.
Mr. Hanna. You said it took a couple of years to withdraw
the milk rule?
Mr. Sunstein. Well, this rule, there was--the EPA proposed
it, I believe it was in the last couple of weeks of the Bush
Administration. There were a series of public comments.
Agencies have a lot of activity, some deregulatory, some
regulatory. We work very hard to make the deregulation as
expansive as possible, and yeah, it took a while. Sometimes the
fact that rulemaking takes a while is not ideal, either because
it would deliver excellent public protections or because it
would produce big savings. But sometimes the machinery works
pretty quickly.
Mr. Hanna. Thank you. I yield back.
Chairman Graves. A couple of last questions. Do you think
that the agencies are going to have problems with the current
budgetary issues that we have when it comes to doing their
retrospective review?
Mr. Sunstein. Oh, on the retrospective review? I am very
optimistic that even in the current budgetary environment we
are going to be able to see a lot of progress in a short time.
Chairman Graves. And my next question deals with the
guidance documents, which can be just as big a problem as the
proposed rule itself.
Mr. Sunstein. Yeah.
Chairman Graves. Is anything being done about that?
Mr. Sunstein. Yes. I agree completely with the concern as
some of the Courts of Appeal have said that a guidance document
is actually a rule. And a few things have been done. The former
head of OMB, Peter Orszag, in a very short but really important
document said that significant guidance documents just like
rules should come into the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs for review. And we have worked very hard to make sure
that guidance documents when they go out are not rules in
sheep's clothing, and to make sure that they are really styled
as, and going to operate as, non-binding. And in cases where
that cannot be done, the best course is to make it a real rule.
Chairman Graves. Okay. And last question. What about the
outside independent agencies, like the SEC? Is there anything
you can do there?
Mr. Sunstein. Yes. The President issued actually an
historic executive order. I think it is 13,579, which says that
the independent agencies should follow the cost saving burden
reducing requirements of his January executive order and should
engage within 120 days in the retrospective review. So that no
president had done before. It is an executive order. We have
already seen some activity from the Federal Communications
Commission in particular, which has announced, I believe, 83
burden-reducing initiatives. They finally got rid, by the way,
of the Fairness Doctrine formally under the impetus of or in
parallel certainly with the President's actions. And with your
help, there is limited presidential authority over the
independent agencies. We think that there is real opportunity
for cost saving initiatives from the independents.
Chairman Graves. I want to thank you for coming in. I
appreciate it. And I would ask that you maintain contact with
the Committee to update us on the progress of the retrospective
reviews.
And with that I would ask unanimous consent that all
members have five legislative days to review and extend their
remarks. Without objection----
Ms. Velazquez. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask unanimous
consent that--to submit for the record a report on two surveys
conducted by FIB and the Chamber of Commerce that shows that
regulation is not the number one issue impacting or facing
small businesses, but consumer spending, economic uncertainty,
and taxes. And since some members have continued to state that
this is the number one issue, I just would like to ask
unanimous consent to enter that into the record.
Chairman Graves. Without objection, so ordered on both
consents.
With that, the hearing is adjourned. Thank you very much.
[Whereupon, at 2:19 p.m., the Committee hearing was
adjourned.]
