THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT'S INADEQUATE RESPONSE TO HUMAN RIGHTS
CONCERNS IN BOLIVIA: THE CASE OF AMERICAN JACOB OSTREICHER

----------

WEDNESDAY, JUNE 6, 2012

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health,
and Human Rights,
Committee on Foreign Affairs,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 o'clock
a.m., in room 2172 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon.
Christopher H. Smith (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Smith. The subcommittee will come to order, and I want
to wish everybody a good morning. Thank you for joining us for
this extremely important and timely hearing to examine the
situation of Mr. Jacob Ostreicher, who has been imprisoned for
over 1 year in Bolivia, and the involvement of the State
Department in this case.
Normally this subcommittee focuses on human rights issues
in the context of whether foreign governments are respecting
the rights of their own people. But today we are undertaking
the sobering task of defending the human rights of one of our
own fellow citizens. Mr. Ostreicher and his wife, Miriam Ungar,
who is here with us today to testify on behalf of him, are from
New York. His daughter, Chaya Weinberger, will also be
testifying, and she is from New Jersey and a resident of my
congressional district. She lives in Lakewood.
They are part of a large family and a close-knit Orthodox
Jewish community. It was actually Rabbi Aaron Kotler, the chief
executive officer of Beth Medrash Govoha, the yeshiva, who
first brought Mr. Ostreicher's plight to my attention about 3
weeks ago. Human rights abuses that are happening to Mr.
Ostreicher in Bolivia are being felt deeply and personally here
in our own country.
Our distinguished witnesses will provide compelling
testimony on the facts of Mr. Ostreicher's case and the abuses
that he has suffered and continues to suffer. And we will also
examine whether Mr. Ostreicher has been receiving the
assistance that he should receive as a United States citizen
abroad, with the purpose of ascertaining what should be done
going forward. We will also do everything we can to correct the
ongoing extreme injustice being perpetrated against Mr.
Ostreicher and secure his freedom as quickly as possible.
