SEMIANNUAL COMMITTEE ACTIVITY REPORT AND FOREIGN RELATIONS
AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEAR 2013

----------

WEDNESDAY, JUNE 27, 2012

House of Representatives,
Committee on Foreign Affairs,
Washington, DC.
The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:30 a.m. in
room 2172, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Ileana Ros-
Lehtinen (chairman of the committee) presiding.
Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. The committee will come to order.
There are nine markups going on, none as interesting as
this one, so stay around. We are going to go through it
quickly.
Pursuant to notice, the committee meets today to approve
our semiannual activities report and to mark up the Foreign
Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013.
According to the expedited procedures I shared with all
members yesterday, we will consider and approve these consensus
measures at the outset. Afterwards, I will recognize myself, my
good friend, the ranking member, Mr. Berman, and any member
wishing recognition for remarks.
Without objection, all members may have 5 days to insert
written remarks into the record on any of today's business.
The committee will now consider our Semiannual Legislative
Review and Oversight Activities Report as required by House
Rule XI.
Without objection, the June 2012 report text that members
have in front of them, which was provided in draft form from
last Wednesday and posted online earlier this week, is
considered read.
[The information referred to follows:]

Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. The Chair moves that the report be
adopted by the committee.
All those in favor, say aye.
All opposed, no.
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and the
report is approved.
We now consider the Foreign Relations Authorization bill,
which was provided to your office, as I said, in draft form
last week and in final form Monday morning. The clerk will
report the bill.
Ms. Carroll. H.R. 6018, to authorize appropriations for the
Department of State for Fiscal Year 2013, and for other
purposes.
Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. Without objection, the bill is
considered read and open for amendment at any point.
[H.R. 6018 follows:]

Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. Hearing no amendments and reporting
a quorum being present, the Chair moves that the committee
approve H.R. 6018 as introduced.
All those in favor, say aye. Aye.
All opposed, no.
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it; and the bill
is agreed to.
Without objection, the bill is ordered favorably reported.
Staff is directed to make technical and conforming changes, and
the Chair is authorized to seek consideration under suspension
of the rules.
Members with competing committee assignments, of which
there are many this morning, will be pleased to know that we
have now concluded the operative portion of today's business. I
will now recognize members who wish to make statements on
today's bill, beginning with myself and the ranking member.
I want to thank the ranking member and all members on both
sides of the aisle for their cooperation in this bipartisan
effort to draft and adopt a State Department authorization bill
for Fiscal Year 2013. H.R. 6018 is a carefully crafted bill,
focusing on the basic funding and operational authorities on
which we have been able to reach bipartisan agreement.
Despite significant efforts by this committee, the
Department of State has not been authorized for nearly a
decade. The last authorization bill to become law, coauthored
by our esteemed former chairmen Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos,
whose portraits grace us now, was enacted in September 2002.
The lack of authorities in the intervening years has eroded
our foreign policy leverage with our primary agency of
jurisdiction, the Department of State. By adopting this bill
this morning, the committee strengthens its role in exercising
effective oversight of the Department of State and fulfills our
obligation to the American public.
The text authorizes basic funding for the State Department,
the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and the Peace Corps at
fiscally responsible levels coordinated with the Appropriations
Committee. Most accounts are authorized at the bipartisan
levels from Fiscal Year 2012 from that omnibus bill.
H.R. 6018 also includes management reforms to increase the
efficiency, accountability, and safety of our personnel
overseas. It establishes important jurisdiction and oversight
authorities in the expanding fields of cybersecurity,
counterterrorism, communications, and arms export controls. It
helps American businesses by modifying the arms export control
authorities to reduce obstacles and streamline the process for
exporting selected equipment and parts. At the same time, it
enhances U.S. security by increasing safeguards against the
transfer of U.S. technologies to state sponsors of terrorism
and countries subject to U.S. arms embargoes.
For all of these reasons, H.R. 6018 deserves the bipartisan
support that it received this morning. I am confident that the
strong signal sent by today's committee action will lead to
prompt consideration by the full House and, ultimately, the
enactment of these basic authorities into law.
I again want to thank the ranking member and, indeed, all
of our members for their assistance and cooperation; and I am
now pleased to recognize----
Mr. Rohrabacher. Madam Chairman?
Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. Yes, Mr. Rohrabacher?
Mr. Rohrabacher. Congratulations. Thank you.
Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you, sir. We will always
recognize you for that.
I am now so pleased to recognize my friend, the ranking
member, for his remarks on the legislation.
Mr. Berman. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman. If this is
the most interesting of the nine markups, I would hate to see
the most boring.
Madam Chairman, I want to start out by thanking you and
your staff, especially Yleem Poblete and Doug Anderson, for
working closely with us to ensure that this markup produces a
consensus bill.
The State Department authorization bill is one of the most
fundamental legislative responsibilities of this committee and
provides the basis for our Embassies to function and our
diplomats to promote U.S. national interests around the world.
Our national security rests on three pillars: Diplomacy,
development, and defense. Every year the Armed Services
Committee manages to report its bill providing authorities and
resources for the Pentagon. The longer we go without providing
the authority and resources our State Department needs to
promote international cooperation, the greater the temptation
for other committees and other departments to step in.
With this bill, the committee is once again asserting at
least some jurisdiction over the funding and operations of the
State Department. This is an opportunity for us to demonstrate
the capacity to work together to get things done and to promote
our national interests.
I hope we can all agree that the military ought to be our
last line of defense, the option to which we resort after all
other avenues have been closed off. Yet, by ignoring and
shortchanging our diplomats, we only increase the likelihood of
an armed confrontation. Whether in Afghanistan, where a
strengthened diplomatic presence is needed to enable a military
withdrawal, or in the Sahel, where terrorist groups are making
new gains, our Foreign Service Officers are at the front lines
of protecting U.S. national security. This bill gives them the
tools they need to be successful. We owe the brave men and
women who put their lives on the line, military and civilian
alike, no less.
That said, this is by no means a perfect or comprehensive
bill. It contains certain provisions I would prefer to see
removed. It leaves out a long list of provisions I would like
to see added. By and large, the numbers are well below Fiscal
Year 2013 request levels, and lower than what I think is proper
to exert strong and effective international leadership. But the
chairman has worked with us over the past weeks to make the
changes necessary to arrive at a text that has the best shot of
moving forward.
This bill contains no funding for foreign assistance
programs, nor does it include any proposals for foreign aid
reform. Those topics should also be high priorities for this
committee, and I look forward to working with the chairman on
provisions to address how our foreign aid dollars are spent.
Accounting for just 1 percent of the overall budget, foreign
assistance is a small but wise investment in a better, safer
world. Our job is to ensure that it is spent in the most
efficient and effective way.
The bill also does not contain any country-specific
provisions or any findings or sense of Congress language. While
I note that all of us have pressing things we would want to say
about U.S. policy toward a wide range of countries and
problems, I respect the chairman's view that progress on
asserting our jurisdiction is paramount and that there will be
other business meetings and other markups where those kinds of
proposals can be considered on their merits. If we want our
committee to be taken seriously so that our jurisdiction is
protected and our views carry weight with other committees,
then we need to report legislation, at the very least, that can
be passed by the full House.
Let me describe a few of the bill's key provisions in
greater detail.
It includes a number of provisions to better protect our
men and women serving abroad as well as their families. It
allows the State Department to award local guard contracts in
high-risk areas on the basis of best value rather than on who
had the lowest bid. In the past, lowest bids had sometimes
resulted in poorly trained security forces that endangered the
safety of our diplomats and development experts. This bill also
better protects the children of U.S. employees who attend
school overseas by improving the physical security at these
locations.
More importantly, by allowing the Secretary to transfer
authorities to the recently created Counterterrorism, Conflict
and Stabilization Operations, and Energy Resources Bureaus,
this act reflects the organizational changes that have taken
place at the Department as a result of what I hope will be the
first of regular Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Reviews.
The bill also incorporates most of H.R. 3288, the
Safeguarding U.S. Satellite Leadership and Security Act. It was
also adopted as an amendment to the National Defense
Authorization Act. This bipartisan provision would help restore
America's global competitiveness in high-tech satellite
technology and protect vital U.S. national security interests.
Madam Chairman, you and your staff have produced a good and
fair piece of legislation. Equally important, you have taken
our views into account. I would urge my colleagues to do what
they have already done, and that is to approve this legislation
not only on its merits, but also as an expression of support
for enhancing comity and bipartisanship in our committee.
I thank the chair, and you might not believe it, but this
is actually a shorter statement than I was planning on giving,
and I will yield back the balance of my time.
Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. I thank my good friend, Mr. Berman,
for that opening statement; and I am pleased to yield 5 minutes
to Mr. Royce of California.
Mr. Royce. Thank you, Madam Chairman; and I would also like
to thank you, I would like to thank Ranking Member Berman for
the support of a provision that I inserted in this legislation
to expand the authority of the State Department to go after
those who commit crimes against humanity, such as Joseph Kony.
As you know, the existing State Department's rewards
program has largely focused recently on terrorists. They focus
on drug traffickers. We had a hearing, Madam Chair, where we
heard the results of some of that effect of the rewards program
where those who were involved in trafficking, for example, when
captured would say there was nobody they could turn to; they
felt like a wanted man. Well, that is exactly the type of
emotion we are trying to engender here, and this program does
this. The provisions in the bill now would expand the program,
and it would also target something else we want to affect, and
that is transnational organized crime. There will be a rewards
program to induce people to come forward.
And lastly, and I think very importantly, those who are
wanted for the most serious human rights abuses--and this
responds to two things. One, the growing ties between
terrorists and transnational criminals. We target those who
assist terrorists and those who assist the drug cartels with
weapons, those involved in weapons trafficking, those involved
in sophisticated forgeries, money laundering; and, importantly,
then this legislation will also allow the rewards program to
target those wanted for genocide, for war crimes, crimes
against humanity. These are the world's worst human rights
abusers that we are trying to focus on.
A target of this, of course, will be Joseph Kony and the
top commanders of the Lord's Resistance Army. This group has
terrorized northern Uganda as well as Central Africa now for
two decades. The crimes that they commit there are unspeakable;
and, in accordance with U.S. policy, a small team of U.S.
troops are currently in the field helping local forces hunt for
these killers.
Our U.S. troops have indicated to us that they believe that
a rewards program would help them if it is aimed at Kony. It
will help them generate intelligence. It will bolster their
efforts. They are asking for this provision. They think this
can make a difference for them on the ground, and let's answer
their call.
Thank you, Madam Chair, for including this; and we look
forward to trying to speed this legislation along to the
Senate.
Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. We sure do. Thank you, Mr. Royce.
Mr. Connolly of Virginia is recognized.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
I know that I speak for myself and certainly my friend, Mr.
Chandler from Kentucky, when I say mirabile dictu, wondrous to
relate, having a markup this smooth, this uncomplicated,
lacking in controversial policy riders, bringing us together on
a bipartisan basis. I think you and your staff and Mr. Berman,
the ranking member, and his staff are to be commended for
bringing us together.
I look forward to supporting this. There are many
provisions in here, particularly those involving commercial
satellite technology, that I think are a big improvement over
existing policy; and I hope--I applaud Mr. Berman in
introducing the legislation and you in adopting it as an
amendment.
And, of course, I also associate myself with the remarks of
our friend from California, Mr. Royce, in other provisions that
I think are going to make a difference in human rights and
getting finally Joseph Kony brought to justice.
So thank you, Madam Chairman, and thank you to your
respective staffs for your leadership and the ranking member as
well.
Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Chandler is recognized.
Mr. Chandler. Madam Chairwoman, since I was referred to in
my colleague's remarks, I just want to thank my Irish friend
for his Latin eloquence.
Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you very much.
Mr. Faleomavaega.
Mr. Faleomavaega. Madam Chair, I didn't realize I was going
to come this quickly.
I thank you, Madam Chair, and certainly our ranking member
for the spirit of bipartisanship and working so hard in putting
this authorization bill together. Madam Chair, I certainly want
to commend both you and our ranking member, Mr. Berman, for
doing this; and I am sure that my colleagues on this side of
the aisle are very happy that we have come to a very good
conclusion in reaching an agreement on how we can pass this
legislation as soon as we can.
With that, I yield back.
Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. The gentleman yields back.
Hearing no further requests for recognition, I want to
thank again all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle
for the hard work and cooperation that went into today's
meeting; and, with that, the committee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 10:21 a.m., the committee was adjourned.]
