WIDESPREAD FLOODING IN COLOMBIA

----------

THURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2011

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere,
Committee on Foreign Affairs,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:04 p.m., in
room 2172, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Connie Mack
(chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Mack. The subcommittee will come to order. After the
conclusion of this brief business meeting we will proceed
immediately to today's hearing.
Pursuant to notice for purposes of a markup, I call up
resolution H. Res. 77. Without objection, the resolution to be
considered will be considered as read and open for amendment at
any point.
[H. Res. 77 follows:]

Mr. Mack. I have a bipartisan amendment in the nature of a
substitute that members have in front of them, which is
identical to the one that was provided previously to your
offices and made publicly available in electronic format
pursuant to committee rule 5(b)(3).
I want to thank--well, first of all, I would like to say
that unfortunately Mr. Engel isn't able to be here today. He is
under the weather. I know he is because I saw him yesterday and
he didn't look good yesterday. So tell the ranking member that
we hope he feels better soon.
But I would like to thank also his staff, the minority
staff, for their assistance in updating and amending this text.
The clerk will report the amendment.
Ms. Carroll. Amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.
Res. 77 offered by Mr. Mack of Florida. Strike the preamble----
[The information referred to follows:]
ANS deg.

Mr. Mack. Without objection, the amendment in the nature of
a substitute shall be considered as read for purposes of
amendment. I recognize myself briefly to speak on the
amendment.
This amendment expresses the United States' desire to stand
by the Colombian people in the wake of a massive flooding that
impacted millions of lives. It also acknowledges the economic
damages that resulted from this tragedy and calls on the U.S.
administration to right the misdirected approach it has taken
toward our important ally and start engaging in policies that
promote economic growth.
Expanded economic opportunity helps countries rebound from
natural disasters such as the one Colombia has experienced,
provides alternatives to illegal activities, and is a priority
for our own economic and national security interests in the
United States.
Are there any other members who wish to strike the last
word and speak on this text?
Hearing no further amendment, the question is on agreeing
to the amendment in the nature of a substitute. All those in
favor say aye. All those opposed say no.
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it and the
amendment in the nature of a substitute is agreed to. The
question now occurs on adopting the resolution, as amended. All
those in favor say aye. All those opposed say no.
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. The bill, as
amended, is agreed to. And without objection, the motion to
reconsider is laid on the table.
I now move that the bill, as amended, be reported favorably
to the full Committee on Foreign Affairs. All those in favor
say aye. All those opposed say no.
The ayes have it and the motion is agreed to. Without
objection, the staff are directed to make any technical and
conforming changes.
That concludes our business, and without objection, the
subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 2:07 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
