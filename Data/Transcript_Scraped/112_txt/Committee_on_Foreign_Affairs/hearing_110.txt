CALLING FOR THE REPATRIATION OF POW/MIAs AND ABDUCTEES FROM THE KOREAN
WAR

----------

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 2011

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific,
Committee on Foreign Affairs,
Washington, DC.
The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 11:30 a.m., in
room 2226 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Donald A.
Manzullo (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Manzullo. The subcommittee will come to order. After
the conclusion of this brief business meeting, we will proceed
immediately to today's hearing on the Compact of Free
Association with the Republic of Palau. Pursuant to notice, for
purposes of a markup, I call for House Resolution 376: Calling
for the Repatriation of POW/MIAs and the Abductees from the
Korean War.
[H. Res. 376 follows:]

Mr. Manzullo. Without objection, the measure is considered
read, and open for amendment at any point. Before recognizing
myself and other members for statements, I have a bipartisan
amendment in the nature of a substitute that makes a few
changes to the underlying resolution. These edits and updates,
which were sent to your offices yesterday, were carefully
negotiated with the author, Mr. Rangel, and his staff.
The clerk will report the amendment.
Mr. Gutfrucht. Amendment in the nature of a substitute to
H. Res. 376, offered by Mr. Manzullo of Illinois. Strike the
preamble and insert----
Mr. Manzullo. Without objection, the amendment in the
nature of a substitute is considered read.
[The amendment offered by Mr. Manzullo follows:]

Mr. Manzullo. All members are given leave to insert remarks
on this measure into the record, should they decide to do so. I
now recognize myself to speak on this measure.
On June 25, 1950, the North Koreans initiated the Korean
War by unleashing a torrent of death and destruction across the
border against America's ally, South Korea, in a brazen effort
to reunite the divided peninsula under the oppressive red flag
of communism. The legacy of the Korean War reverberates 61
years later, with a nuclear-armed North Korea still menacing
peaceful nations and the hundreds of thousands of people it
still holds as prisoners of war and abductees.
Approximately 1.8 million members of the U.S. Armed Forces
fought in Korea, alongside South Korea and United Nations
forces. The sacrifices of the more than 128,600 Americans
killed or wounded in that conflict will never be forgotten. Our
friends in South Korea suffered equally with us in their
darkest hour, with the added misery that the war was fought in
their homeland.
For so many families in the U.S and Korea, the war has
never ended. The Defense Department reports that more than
8,000 American servicemen as POW/MIAs in the conflict, with
5,500 soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines in North Korea.
Families all throughout this great country still do not have
the closure they deserve after so many years, and it is time
that North Korea told the truth about their whereabouts.
In South Korea, it is estimated that as many as 73,000
servicemembers were never reported by North Korea as POWs. Add
to this the abduction of approximately 100,000 South Korean
civilians, and we can finally have a clear picture of North
Korea's brutality.
House Resolution 376 recognizes the plight of American and
South Korean prisoners of war and civilian abductees still
alive in North Korea. It calls on both the U.S. and South
Korean Governments to thoroughly investigate any sightings of
POWs and civilian abductees. The resolution also calls on North
Korea to admit the kidnapping of over 100,000 people during the
war, and to repatriate remaining POWs and civilian abductees as
required by the Geneva Convention.
The amendment in the nature of a substitute makes several
changes to the base text of H. Res. 376. This amendment was
drafted in coordination with the bill's sponsor, Representative
Rangel of New York, and makes a number of changes, too many to
explain in the time I have for these remarks.
Key items include: Recognition of the thousands of South
Korean men forcibly conscripted into the North Korean Army; the
abduction of South Korean civilians by North Korea in its
attempts to communize the South; the hardship endured by South
Korean families of the abducted civilians; North Korea's
refusal to acknowledge, account for, or repatriate abductees;
and strong U.S. efforts to negotiate release of these civilians
during the Korean War Armistice Commission Conference of 1953.
There is no excuse for North Korea to refuse family
reunions for the more than 100,000 South Koreans forcibly
abducted 61 years ago. We owe it to our South Korean friends
and the nearly 1.5 million Americans of Korean descent to never
give up the fight for their release.
Personally, I will never forget the day when former South
Korean Ambassador Lee Tae-Sik made a special visit to the 16th
Congressional District in Illinois to personally thank American
veterans of the Korean War for defending his country and
protecting his people. As I stood watching the Ambassador
deliver his remarks, and the emotional response of our
veterans, I could not be but overcome with great respect and
gratitude for the friendship our two nations share.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Manzullo follows:]

----------

Mr. Manzullo. I now recognize the ranking member, Mr.
Faleomavaega.
Mr. Faleomavaega. Mr. Chairman, thank you for calling this
hearing. I appreciate very much your leadership and your
efforts in bringing this important resolution before the
subcommittee for markup. Mr. Chairman, House Resolution 376 was
authored, introduced, and sponsored by a true American hero, my
good friend, the Honorable Charles Rangel from New York. I am
very proud to be an original co-sponsor of this resolution.
House Resolution 376 calls for the repatriation of POWs,
MIAs, and abductees from the Korean War. I know this
legislation is near and dear to Congressman Rangel's heart, as
was the resolution he introduced last year to recognize the
60th anniversary of the Korean War. Last year's resolution,
which was passed by Congress and signed by the President,
should have borne Charlie Rangel's name in it. To me, it always
will be.
Mr. Chairman, some 30,000 soldiers lost their lives in the
Korean War from 1950 to 1953. In a Black unit led mostly by
White officers, Acting Sergeant Charles Rangel was awarded the
Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his heroic service in the
Korean War, having led his comrades from behind enemy lines in
circumstances few of us have ever known.
I commend the Honorable Charles Rangel for his valor, for
his sacrifice and courage. I also want to thank the Korean-
American community here in the metropolitan DC area, Los
Angeles and New York, and especially Mr. Dongsuk Kim, the
founder and former president of the Korean-American Voters'
Council, for their grassroots efforts in support of this
resolution.
The resolution is very important to the Korean-American
community because some have relatives that are POWs currently
in North Korea, and some of their relatives are still alive and
want to be repatriated. At the very least, these Korean-
Americans just want to find out the status of their relatives
that were taken as POWs during the Korean War.
Mr. Chairman, I would ask unanimous consent that this
article in the New York Times dated November 28 of this year,
entitled ``Calling Out Names of 83,000 Lost South Koreans,'' be
made part of the record.
Again, I want to say that on behalf of our Korean-American
community, for all those who served and sacrificed so much
during the Korean War, I urge my colleagues to support this
resolution.
I yield back.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Faleomavaega follows:]

----------

Mr. Manzullo. Without objection, the article will be
admitted. Are there any other members who would like to strike
the last word and speak? Mr. Royce.
Mr. Royce. I would like to. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for
scheduling this markup. I really want to thank our colleague
Charlie Rangel, who sort of has the quintessentially American
sense of humor, and documented his role in that conflict in his
book, ``And I Haven't Had a Bad Day Since.''
I think, for those who fought in this war, for that
generation of Americans and South Koreans who bled in that war,
they take some umbrage with the idea that some refer to this as
a ``forgotten war.'' They haven't forgotten that war. And I
think, by moving this legislation forward, we are signalling
that this committee hasn't forgotten that war.
I have chaired the Interparliamentary Exchange with South
Korea for some years, and I know the impact that that conflict
had on South Korea. I think, as much as anything, this
resolution demonstrates the shared commitment and the sacrifice
that serves as the foundation of the U.S.-Korea alliance.
A lot has changed in the last six decades since the war.
Certainly with the United States' support, South Korea has
transformed into a modern leading economy. Yet north of the
38th parallel in North Korea--and I have been in North Korea--
they still live literally in darkness.
It has been more than 60 years now, and our Department of
Defense still lists more than 8,000 American servicemen as POWs
or missing in action from the Korean War. The number of South
Koreans is estimated to be many multiples of that. And of
course, as mentioned, you had 100,000 South Koreans forcibly
conscripted into the North Korean army.
For our veterans, and for their families, it is well past
time for a full accounting, which this resolution calls for. So
I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. Manzullo. Do any other members seek recognition to
speak on it? Mr. Duncan.
Mr. Duncan. Thank you. I just want to echo Chairman Royce's
comments there, that my wife just participated in an honor
flight, coming up to Washington. And I was sitting here,
thinking about it being the month when we celebrate and
recognize Veterans' Day, and honor the memory of those who have
fought and those who are currently serving. And I think about
the number of Korean War veterans that I run across, just in
daily contact around the District.
And I just want to pause and say thank you to those men and
women who served so valiantly in a war that, a lot of times, is
forgotten when we focus on the current War on Terror, and are
remembering those of the greatest generation, World War II
veterans, that are passing away at a very rapid rate.
And I just want to pause and say, we do remember the Korean
War veterans. This is a very timely resolution. And I just want
to echo Mr. Royce's comments, as well, and simply say thanks.
I yield back.
Mr. Manzullo. Do any other members seek recognition?
[No response.]
Mr. Manzullo. Hearing none, and there being no further
amendments, the question is on agreeing to the bipartisan
amendment in the nature of a substitute.
All those in favor, say aye.
[Chorus of ayes.]
Mr. Manzullo. Those opposed, say no.
[No response.]
Mr. Manzullo. In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it
and the amendment of the nature of a substitute is agreed to.
The question now occurs on adopting the resolution as amended.
All those in favor, say aye.
[Chorus of ayes.]
Mr. Manzullo. Those opposed, say no.
[No response.]
Mr. Manzullo. In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have
it, and the amended resolution is agreed to. Without objection,
H. Res. 376 as amended is reported favorably to the full
Committee on Foreign Affairs, and staff are directed to make
any technical and conforming changes.
That concludes our business. Without objection, the
subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:44 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
