THURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2011

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere,
Committee on Foreign Affairs,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 3:02 p.m., in
room 2172 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Connie Mack
(chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Mack. The subcommittee will finally come to order.
After the conclusion of this brief business meeting, we will
proceed immediately into today's hearing. Pursuant to notice,
for purposes of a markup, I call up the resolution H.R. 1016,
To measure the progress of relief, recovery, reconstruction,
and development efforts in Haiti following the earthquake of
January 12, 2010, and for other purposes.
[H.R. 1016 follows:]

Mr. Mack. Without objection, the bipartisan amendment in
the nature of a substitute that was provided previously to
members' offices and made available and online will be
considered as base text, and is open for amendment at any
point.
[The amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 1016
follows:]

Mr. Mack. I also want to thank the ranking member, Mr.
Engel, and the minority staff for their assistance in updating
and amending this text. I think that means you. Also, all
members are able to insert remarks on this measure into the
record, should they choose to do so.
Before turning to myself to offer a brief amendment and
speak, I will recognize myself briefly for a few opening words.
On January 12, 2010, Haiti was devastated by the most powerful
earthquake to strike that nation in over 200 years.
Since that time, the people of Haiti have been impacted by
a hurricane with widespread flooding. The challenge of
Presidential and legislative elections in this difficult
environment, and a health epidemic impacting hundreds of
thousands of Haitians.
While Haiti has been a focus of the State Department's
activities in the Western Hempisphere, oversight of the
implementation of U.S. assistance has been a priority for the
Foreign Affairs Committee. I look forward to continuing to work
with everyone to make sure U.S. dollars are spent in an
effective, responsible, and transparent manner, as we continue
to support the people of Haiti.
And at this time, I would like--I have an amendment on
behalf of Mr. Engel at the desk. The clerk will report the
amendment.
Mr. Gately. Amendment to the amendment in the nature of a
substitute to H.R. 1016, offered by Mr. Mack of Florida.
[The amendment referred to follows:]

Mr. Mack. Without objection, the amendment is considered as
read for purposes of amendment. And I am pleased to recognize
myself again to speak on this amendment. Unless there are other
members who wish to strike the last word and briefly speak, we
can move to a vote.
The question is on agreeing to the amendement offered by
myself and Mr. Engel. All those in favor say aye.
[Ayes.]
All those opposed say no. In the opinion of the chair, the
ayes have it, and the amendment is agreed to.
Hearing no other amendments, the question now occurs on
adopting the bill as amended. All those in favor, say aye.
[Ayes.]
All those opposed, say no. In the opinion of the chair, the
ayes have it.
The bill as amended is agreed to, and without objection the
motion to reconsider is laid on the table. Without objection,
the bill will be reported favorably to the full committee in
the form of a single amendment in the nature of a substitute
incorporating the amendments adopted here today, and the staff
is directed to make any technical and conforming amendments.
That concludes our business, and without objection, the
subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 3:06 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
