WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 2012

House of Representatives,
Committee on Foreign Affairs,
Washington, DC.
The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 o'clock a.m.
in room 2172, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Ileana Ros-
Lehtinen (chairman of the committee) presiding.
Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. The committee will come to order.
Before we begin today's markup and hearing, I would like to ask
my colleagues and all who are joining us today to please stand
for a moment of silence to honor United States Ambassador to
Libya, Chris Stevens, Foreign Service Information Management
Officer Sean Smith, and two other fellow Americans killed in
Libya yesterday. [Moment of silence.]
Please be seated. I know I speak for all of the members of
our committee when we say that our prayers go out to their
families and their friends. They died in service of our Nation,
and we are forever grateful. They risked their lives to help
the people of Libya free themselves from the oppression of
Ghadafi and rebuild their nation. Yet on a day marking the 11th
anniversary of the deplorable attacks against our Nation on
September 11, 2001, radicals chose to attack and kill our
diplomats in Benghazi.
Similarly, I would like to take this opportunity on behalf
of our committee to thank the men and women serving in our
Embassy in Egypt, who also came under attack yesterday by those
who continue to seek the support of, and assistance from, the
United States. Let us be clear, there is no justification for
the murder of our diplomats and attacks on our Embassies. We
have nothing for which to apologize. We must ensure that the
perpetrators of this recent round of 9/11 attacks are held
accountable. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
And before we begin today's hearing, pursuant to notice,
the committee meets to consider H.R. 6313 sponsored by our
colleague, Mr. Faleomavaega. It is a bipartisan measure to
promote peaceful and collaborative resolution of maritime
territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Without objection,
all members may have 5 days to submit statements and extraneous
material on this bill for the record. According to the
expedited procedures sent to all member offices yesterday, we
will now move immediately to adoption of the bill.
[H.R. 6313 follows:]

Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. Without objection, the bill and the
Ros-Lehtinen amendment, number 132 which merely fixes two
typographical errors, which all members have before them, will
be considered as read and considered en bloc.
[The amendment referred to follows:]

I ask unanimous consent that H.R. 6313, as amended, be
agreed to by the committee. Hearing no objection, it is so
ordered. Without objection, the chair is authorized to seek
consideration of H.R. 6313, as amended, under suspension of the
rules, and staff is directed to make any technical or
conforming changes. With a concluding thank you to the ranking
member, and especially to Mr. Faleomavaega for authoring the
bill, the markup is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 10:06 a.m., the committee proceeded to other
business.]
