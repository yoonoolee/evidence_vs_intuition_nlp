Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. The committee will come to order.
Before starting the hearing, pursuant to notice, we meet to
mark up H.R. 4240, the Ambassador James R. Lilley and
Congressman Stephen J. Solarz North Korea Human Rights
Reauthorization Act of 2012. All of you were provided with the
text of that strongly bipartisan bill that Mr. Berman and I
introduced last week, along with 18 of our committee colleagues
and the co-chairs of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission.
Without objection, H.R. 4240 is considered read and open
for amendment at any point.
[H.R. 4240 follows:]

Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. As indicated to all of your offices
earlier this week, so that we can proceed directly to a vote, I
intend to place my own statement on the bill into the record,
and without objection all members may have 5 days to place
statements on H.R. 4240 into the record.
I will recognize Mr. Berman for remarks that he would like
to make.
Mr. Berman. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman, for
introducing the bill, for scheduling it for its markup.
I strongly support the reauthorization and will take
advantage of your leave that was granted to include my
statement in the record.
Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you so much, Mr. Berman. And
hearing no amendments to this measure, the question occurs on
agreeing to H.R. 4240 as amended.
All those in favor, say aye.
[Chorus of ayes.]
Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. All those opposed, no.
[No response.]
Chairman Ros-Lehtinen. In the opinion of the Chair, the
ayes have it and the bill is agreed to.
Without objection, H.R. 4240 is ordered favorably reported,
and staff is directed to make any technical and conforming
changes. The markup is adjourned.
[Whereupon, a 10:06 a.m., the committee proceeded to other
business.]
