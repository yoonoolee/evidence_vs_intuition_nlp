THURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2011

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific,
Committee on Foreign Affairs,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:05 p.m., in
room 2360, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Donald A.
Manzullo (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Manzullo. The subcommittee will come to order.
After the conclusion of this brief business meeting, we
will proceed immediately to today's hearing.
As previously announced, we have two noncontroversial
resolutions, H. Res. 139 and H. Res. 172.
[The resolutions follow:]

Mr. Manzullo. Because we are taking them up as introduced
and bipartisan consultations have not indicated the need for
any amendments, it is the intention of the chair to consider
these measures en bloc and, by unanimous consent, to report
them favorably to the full Committee on Foreign Affairs.
All members are given leave to insert remarks on the
measures into the record, should they choose to do so.
Before turning to the ranking member, I would like to say a
few words about the horrible tragedies that struck our dear
friends in New Zealand and Japan.
In the short time span of just over 1 month, the world has
witnessed two horrific natural disasters that struck at the
very core of humanity.
On February 22, 2011, the Canterbury region of New
Zealand's South Island was struck by a magnitude 6.3 earthquake
at 12:51 p.m. local time. This was the second quake to strike
Christchurch, and it occurred at the worst possible time of the
day. The earthquake destroyed historic landmarks, buckled
roads, and left 10,000 homes beyond repair and another 100,000
buildings damaged. It left in its wake a death toll that is
expected to reach close to 200 from all walks of life--
families, friends, students, and teachers--and from around the
world, including the United States.
I have strong feelings regarding this tragedy because my
good friend, Eni Faleomavaega, and I, along with six other
Members of Congress, were in Christchurch attending the U.S.-
New Zealand Partnership Forum just prior to the quake. We
missed the quake by 2 hours and 21 minutes. Many others did
not. Assistant Secretary Kurt Campbell and Cal Cohen, both of
whom are scheduled to testify shortly, and close to 50 American
delegates at the forum, were in the quake. Thankfully, none of
them were hurt.
We were informed of this tragedy by our colleagues in the
New Zealand Parliament during a meeting in Wellington, and our
hearts ached at the loss that they were experiencing.
House Res. 139 expresses the House of Representatives'
condolences to the people of New Zealand for the terrible loss
of life suffered as a result of the quake.
I urge members of the subcommittee to support this
resolution.
Less than 3 weeks after New Zealand's tragedy, Japan was
struck by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake. This catastrophic quake,
recorded as the fourth strongest in the world, was the most
powerful to ever hit Japan. The earth shook for over 5 minutes
and produced an enormous tsunami that surged inland, destroying
entire towns and killing huge numbers of people. As of this
week, over 11,000 people have been confirmed dead, while
another 16,000 remain missing. The Fukushima nuclear power
plant sustained tremendous damage, and, regrettably, we will
not know the long-term effects for many years.
To date, 134 countries have offered assistance, including a
search and rescue team from New Zealand, even as it recovers
from its own disaster. Japan is facing its largest crisis since
World War II, and I admire the people of Japan for their
steadfast courage, resilience, and compassion in confronting
this extreme adversity. The U.S. has 15,000 U.S. personnel on-
ground taking part in around-the-clock operations. We will
continue to do whatever it takes to support one of our closest
friends in the region.
Without objection, the written statements of Representative
Honda, sponsor of House Resolution 172, will be entered into
the record.
I now recognize the ranking member for his remarks.
Mr. Faleomavaega. Mr. Chairman, I also want to commend you
for your leadership and for the initiative that you have taken
on behalf of our subcommittee in offering these two resolutions
touching on the tragedies and the catastrophes that are now
encountered by the good people of New Zealand as well as the
people of Japan.
I do want to commend you. As you have stated earlier, this
is a bipartisan effort on your part and for which I really want
to compliment your efforts in seeing that we do this.
And, on behalf of my colleagues on this side of the aisle,
we wholeheartedly support the substance and the intent of these
two resolutions. And I would like to urge my colleagues on both
sides of the aisle to support these resolutions.
Mr. Manzullo. Accordingly, without objection, the following
resolutions are agreed to and reported favorably to the full
Committee on Foreign Affairs: H. Res. 139 and H. Res. 172.
That concludes our markup. The subcommittee markup stands
adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 2:10 p.m., the subcommittee proceeded to
other business.]
