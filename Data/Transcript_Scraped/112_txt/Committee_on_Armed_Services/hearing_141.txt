DISCLOSURES OF NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION AND IMPACT ON MILITARY
OPERATIONS

----------

House of Representatives,
Committee on Armed Services,
Washington, DC, Wednesday, July 18, 2012.
The committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:12 a.m., in room
2118, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Howard P. ``Buck''
McKeon (chairman of the committee) presiding.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HOWARD P. ``BUCK'' MCKEON, A
REPRESENTATIVE FROM CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON ARMED
SERVICES

The Chairman. The hearing will come to order. Good morning.
The House Armed Services Committee [HASC] meets to receive
testimony on disclosures of national security information and
impact on military operations. The committee will receive
testimony and discuss matters that if disclosed in a public
hearing would endanger national security and therefore requires
the hearing to be closed to the public.
Clause 2(g)(2) of House Rule XI and Committee Rule 9(a)
requires the committee to vote by record vote in open session
with a majority present to close the hearing to the public. We
have scheduled this vote on the disclosure of national security
information hearing today. We will not conduct opening
statements for this hearing today. Immediately after the vote
to close, we will recess this hearing and proceed with the
sequestration hearing. As previously announced, the committee
will resume the hearing on disclosure of national security
information in closed session for Members only at 10 a.m. on
Thursday with a swept hearing room.
Finally, let me remind Members that we will follow the
normal before and after gavel attendance list in determining
the order for questioning witnesses. This means that when we
reconvene this hearing in closed session on Thursday, we will
follow the Member order established today at the gavel.
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr.
Thornberry, vice chair of the HASC, for the purpose of a
motion.
Mr. Thornberry. Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Rule XI
clause 2(g) and Committee Rule 9, I move that the remainder of
today's hearing on the disclosures of national security
information and impact on military operations and proceedings
up to five additional consecutive days of hearings on this
subject shall be closed to the public because disclosure of
testimony, evidence, and other matters to be considered would
endanger national security.
The Chairman. The question is on the motion of the
gentleman from Texas, Mr. Thornberry.
So many as are in favor will vote aye.
Those opposed no. House and committee rules require a
recorded vote. The clerk will call the roll.
