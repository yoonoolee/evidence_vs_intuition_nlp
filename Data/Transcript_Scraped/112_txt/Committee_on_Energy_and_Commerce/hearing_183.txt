OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH R. PITTS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA

In May of this year, the Department of Justice brought
charges against 107 individuals who bilked Medicare for over
$452 million. Just seven individuals in Louisiana were
responsible for over $225 million of this fraud.
In a separate case in February, a single Dallas doctor was
arrested for making $350 million in false claims. In February
of 2011, 114 individuals who had bilked over $240 million were
arrested in another crackdown.
All told, that billion dollars in improper payments
represents less than 2 percent of the estimated $60 billion
annually lost to waste, fraud, and abuse.
As bad as that number is on its own, I want to put it into
context. The Medicare program is running out of money. The CMS
actuary predicts the program could be insolvent in just 5
years. As the Congressional Research Service wrote in a June
2011 report, quote, ``As long as the Medicare trust fund has a
balance, the Treasury Department is authorized to make payments
on behalf of seniors.''
However, the report continues, quote, ``There are no
provisions in the Social Security Act that govern what would
happen if insolvency were to occur,'' end quote. The report
contends that when insolvency of the Medicare program happens,
quote, ``There would be insufficient funds to pay for all Part
A reimbursements to providers,'' end quote.
If Congress and the President support the idea that seniors
should depend on the Medicare program to pay their provider
bills, reform of the program through legislative action will be
needed. The Medicare trustees in their 2011 report to Congress
have already stated as much. One area of reform that I hope we
can tackle in a bipartisan way is the area of fraud and abuse
in the Medicare program.
The Federal Government has made strides recently to improve
catching fraudulent providers and beneficiaries, and I commend
them for their efforts. However, at the same time, they have
largely failed to implement mechanisms that would prevent
fraudulent payments from being made in the first place.
Prosecuting offenders does not get all the money that they
stole.
One such area is predictive analytics. CMS implemented the
fraud prevention system in July of 2011 to analyze Medicare
claims data using models of fraudulent behavior after such a
system was shown to work well in the private industry. However,
while the current system can draw on a host of data sources in
support of its efforts, the system has not yet been integrated
with the agency's payment processing system to allow for the
prevention of payments until suspicious claims can be
determined to be fraudulent.
Further, a recent GAO report stated that CMS has failed to
define an approach for even measuring whether the current
system is helping to prevent fraudulent billing. It is my firm
belief that greater transparency from CMS with regard to
current fraud programs is needed if we hope to build upon what
is currently being done to make the program more secure.
Our Nation's seniors are counting on us to ensure that
Medicare fulfills its promises. We can do that in part by
making sure their premium dollars are managed wisely and not
lost to con artists.
Our hearing today will discuss the efforts Medicare has
undertaken currently to prevent fraud in government programs.
In addition, the panel has generously offered us their time and
expertise to explore emerging technologies and mechanisms that
might help improve those efforts.
I want to thank all of our witnesses for sharing their
thoughts with us today. And I am confident that these ideas can
help generate a bipartisan effort to improve the solvency of
the Medicare program in the coming Congress.
The Chair now recognize the ranking member of the
Subcommittee on Health, Mr. Pallone, for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR., A REPRESENTATIVE
IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And good morning to everyone. It is good to be back after
the election and seeing that our subcommittee is having
hearings and moving forward in the lame duck as well as for
next year.
While the total cost of healthcare fraud is difficult to
obtain, estimates range anywhere from $65 billion to $98
billion annually. For every dollar put into the pockets of
criminals, a dollar is taken out of the system to provide much-
needed care to millions of seniors.
Fraud schemes come in all shapes and sizes and affect all
kinds of insurance, public and private alike. Whether it is a
sham storefront posing as a legitimate provider or legitimate
businesses billing for services that were never provided, it is
all the same result: undermining the integrity of our public
health system and driving up healthcare costs.
I think we can all agree that healthcare fraud is a serious
longstanding problem that will take aggressive long-term
solutions to reverse. And we made a strong commitment to combat
these issues within the Affordable Care Act. The law contains
over 30 antifraud provisions to assist CMS, the OIG, and the
Justice Department in identifying abusive suppliers and
fraudulent billing practices. These include enhanced background
checks, new disclosure requirements, onsite visits to verify
provider information, and a requirement that healthcare
providers create their own internal compliance programs.
The most important provisions in the Affordable Care Act
change the way we fight fraud by heading up the bad actors
before they strike and thwarting their enrollment into these
Federal programs in the first place. And this way, we aren't
just left chasing a payment once the money is already out the
door.
And I am encouraged by the work that has been done of late.
Over the past 3 years, the government has recovered a record-
breaking $10.7 billion of healthcare fraud. So I am confident
that we will begin to see even more savings as the
implementation of these programs continues.
But our efforts must not stop there. Fraud is ever-
changing; criminals will always find loopholes. And it is our
job to keep one step ahead of them. Today we are going to hear
from an array of witnesses about the state of antifraud
measures currently being used, as well as discussing new
approaches.
One example of a new approach is the secure ID program,
which would create identification cards with encrypted chips.
Each Medicare provider and beneficiary would be required to
swipe these cards at the point of service.
And while there may be some benefits to this technology,
such as preventing identity theft, I do have questions about
how this would affect the overall system. Most important to me
is how such a program would affect patients' access to care.
For example, what happens if a senior simply forgets his ID
card? Will he be sent away? I am also interested in how this
technology can prevent the sheer criminals colluding with
beneficiaries and handing out kickbacks.
And as we discuss any potential pilot programs, we must
ensure that we can evaluate different technologies that allow
us to determine what provides the best value for our tax
dollars.
So, Mr. Chairman, as Congress discusses the expiring tax
policies and impending sequestration during the lame duck, I do
not believe we need to decrease benefits to seniors or raise
the eligibility age to further fortify the program. Instead, we
should focus on building upon the reforms of the ACA and
creating better efficiencies within the system, including
innovative ways to combat fraud and waste.
Standing up to protect Medicare includes supporting the
constant work that must be done to cut waste, fraud, and abuse.
And I am committed to working with my colleagues now and in the
future to help address this ongoing threat. So I do appreciate
your having this committee hearing today because I think it
addresses a very important issue, both now and in the future,
in the next Congress as well.
I did want, Mr. Chairman, if I could, to ask unanimous
consent to insert two pieces of testimony in the record. The
first is from the American Medical Association, which I believe
raises some very important questions about smart cards. At a
minimum, further discussion with a more robust representation
of interested parties would seem to be warranted on that issue.
And the second is a statement from the National Health Law
Program, which discusses smart cards in the Medicaid context
and raises concerns about whether these cards could serve as a
barrier to timely patient care.
So I would ask unanimous consent. I think you have both of
them.
Mr. Pitts. Yes. Without objection, so ordered.

Mr. Pallone. Thank you. And I yield back.
Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentleman and now
recognizes the vice chairman of the subcommittee, Dr. Burgess,
for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS, A REPRESENTATIVE
IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS

Mr. Burgess. And I thank the chairman for the recognition
and the time.
We all know that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services has not done enough to address the issue of
inappropriate payments even though our government-administered
health system does appear to waste billions of dollars every
year. Eliminating inappropriate payments, payments that, in
fact, embarrassingly hemorrhage from the programs, is, as Mr.
Pallone pointed out, a bipartisan issue.
Unfortunately, there is no simple answer. Fraud analysts
are estimating up to 10 cents out of every dollar that is spent
in health care is lost yearly to fraud. That is 10 cents out of
every dollar we are spending. One-fifth of all healthcare
expenditures in this country are spent on the Medicare system.
So that is a big figure, a big dollar figure, that demands our
attention. We could pay for everything we need to pay for, the
doc fix, in this decade and the next decade if we simply fixed
that problem.
We do pay providers in practically an automatic fashion.
This May I asked for and received a briefing from one of the
deputy administrators at CMS, who is the Director for Center
Program Integrity, and talked about their efforts to move from
a pay-and-chase mindset into one that builds on a system of
predictive modeling.
Now, the good news is that things do seem to be moving
forward in that arena. They started with 9 algorithms and
quickly grew to over 30. And that was last May, so I don't know
what that figure stands at today. But it is clearly an area
that is crying to be taken care of.
They are some first steps, but they are not going nearly
far enough. Had we addressed these technologies years ago, just
think about the amount of money that could have been saved and
how many generations of algorithms and new generations of
algorithms that could now be in place.
As a physician, I support prompt pay, and I realize the
size, scope, and complexity of the Medicare program makes it
highly susceptible to inappropriate payments. We have to
accelerate the use of these analytics to aid in our detection
efforts. But, you know, it is not new concepts. The Visa folks
do this every hour of every day of every week and will call you
when there is untoward activity occurring on your credit or
debit card and are pretty quick to do so. Unfortunately, in our
Federal agencies, anything we do cannot be defined as
``quick.''
We have learned from watching some of the predictive
modeling activities in the crop insurance program that, simply
recognizing that there is a cop on the beat, people are less
likely to misbehave. Right now we have whole industries--
illicit industries, crooked industries--that are being built
around the fact that we just simply make so much money
available to them, they can hardly resist the temptation to
cheat.
Back-end investigations will remain a part of what CMS is
required to do. We need to be sure that we have the
prosecutorial force to be able to go--when these individuals
are uncovered, to make certain that we can go after them with
the full force of the law.
The Government Accountability Office has made
recommendations, some of which date back to a decade when I
first started in Congress, and many of those have yet to be
implemented. And we need to pay attention to what they tell us
this morning.
Developing new and innovative approaches to fight fraud has
become increasingly important. I certainly look forward--we
have a very--a panel in front of us today that has vast
experience, and I expect that they can give us a great deal of
enlightenment.
And with that, I do want to yield to my colleague from
Georgia, Dr. Gingrey.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Burgess follows:]
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 85722.019

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 85722.020

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PHIL GINGREY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA

Mr. Gingrey. I thank Dr. Burgess for yielding to me.
Mr. Chairman, it is appropriate that we as a committee look
at the various tools for fixing the Medicare program.
Strategically, identifying fraud, waste, and abuse is essential
to trying to solve and to save this program that so heavily
benefits our seniors.
Let's face it, Medicare will go bankrupt, depending on who
you talk to, between 2017 and 2024. At this point, we must seek
to identify waste and eliminate it--an estimated, what is it,
anywhere from $60 billion to $90 billion a year. And this money
should be used to preserve Medicare and not pad the wallets of
criminals.
We need to ensure that the agencies are all using all of
the powers they already have at their disposal to save wasted
money. I would hope that we can eventually take a proactive
approach in identifying criminals, one where we eliminate the
payment before it is made rather than chase them afterwards.
This is a huge problem. And I think that every one of us are
appalled, especially those of us who are healthcare providers,
who have worked in that field, as Dr. Burgess and myself, for
years, trying to do the right thing, and knowing that people
are stealing money from those who really, really need it.
So I am glad, Mr. Chairman--thank you for having the
hearing. And I look forward to hearing from the witnesses.
And I yield back. Thank you, Dr. Burgess.
Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentleman and now
recognizes the ranking member of the full committee, Mr.
Waxman, for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HENRY A. WAXMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

Mr. Waxman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for recognizing me and
for holding this hearing today and focusing on the important
topic of Medicare and Medicaid fraud.
Healthcare fraud robs taxpayers of funds, affects the
quality of care provided to program enrollees, and saps the
public confidence in the program. And that is why I see
fighting fraud as a critical need and an issue where we should
be able to achieve bipartisan consensus.
The vast majority of Medicare and Medicaid providers are
compassionate and honest. The vast majority of beneficiaries of
these programs desperately need the care they provide. So we
need to be tough on fraud and tough on criminals who take
advantage of these programs and their beneficiaries, but we can
and should not blame the victim.
One of the reasons I am so proud of the Affordable Care Act
is that it contains dozens of antifraud provisions. The
legislation has the most important reforms to prevent Medicare
and Medicaid fraud in a generation, and already they are
yielding results.
As a result of the strengthened enrollment and re-
enrollment process, CMS has deactivated 136,682 provider
enrollments and revoked another 12,477. The new fraud
prevention system of analytics has generated numerous new leads
for new and existing investigations and providers and
beneficiary interviews.
The healthcare reform law shifted the prevailing fraud-
prevention philosophy from pay and chase, where law enforcement
authorities only identify fraud after it happens, to inspect
and prevent. But even so, the need for boots-on-the-ground
investigation work will always remain.
I am proud of these efforts to reduce fraud. We are going
to hear today from a number of witnesses describing additional
steps and technologies CMS could take in terms of fighting
fraud. I know some of today's witnesses support legislation to
mandate CMS undertake a pilot project testing specific
technology. If Congress is considering giving CMS additional
funding to test new fraud-fighting activities, first we should
give them the flexibility to test different interventions and
compare the results, not mandate one very prescriptive
activity.
Second, we must ensure that whatever CMS decides to test is
evaluated carefully to determine which technologies provide the
best value for our tax dollars. Smart cards may help address
the problem of identity theft; however, reducing identity theft
will not eliminate fraud, and smart cards may not be the only
way to address issues of identity verification. In fact, both
the American Medical Association, representing our Nation's
physicians, and the National Health Law Program, representing
low-income beneficiary advocates, raise some important issues
for policymakers to consider with respect to these cards.
I am glad the committee is continuing the dialogue on
reducing fraud in the Medicare program. If we truly care about
protecting the taxpayer, we should build upon the
administration's initiatives to reduce Medicare fraud. I hope
that we can work across the aisle to do just that.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back my time.
Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
That concludes our opening statements from Members.
Mr. Burgess. Mr. Chairman?
Mr. Pitts. Yes?
Mr. Burgess. If I could ask unanimous consent, I have a
letter here from Mr. Roskam describing a bill that he and Mr.
Carney have introduced on provider identity protection, and I
would like to submit that for the record.
Mr. Pitts. Without objection, so ordered.

STATEMENT OF KATHLEEN M. KING

Ms. King. Chairman Pitts, Ranking Member Pallone, and
members of the subcommittee, I am pleased to be here today to
discuss our work regarding Medicare fraud, including the types
of providers involved in fraud and strategies we have
identified that could help prevent or detect fraud.
Since 1990, we have designated Medicare as a high-risk
program because its size and complexity make it vulnerable to
fraud. Recently, for the first time, we were able to identify
the types of providers investigated for and convicted of fraud,
which should help CMS and other agencies target their efforts
to prevent and reduce fraud.
In our work, we defined the subject of fraud cases as
either institutions or individuals. We found that many
different types of providers were investigated for fraud. In
2010, medical facilities, such as medical centers, clinics, and
practices, were the most frequent subjects of criminal fraud
investigations, accounting for about a quarter of all
investigations, followed by durable medical equipment
suppliers, which accounted for 16 percent. Beneficiaries
accounted for 3 percent of investigations.
Of these, the HHS Office of Inspector General referred
about 15 percent of the subjects investigated for criminal
fraud to the Department of Justice for prosecution. And in
2010, nearly 1,100 subjects were charged in criminal fraud
cases. Of those charged, approximately 85 percent were found
guilty, pled guilty, or pled no contest. Medical facilities and
DME suppliers accounted for about 40 percent of these subjects.
With respect to civil fraud cases, about 2,300 subjects
were investigated in 2010. Hospitals and other medical
facilities accounted for nearly 40 percent of the subjects in
the civil cases that were pursued. According to the OIG, about
40 percent of the--I am sorry, about 50 percent of the cases
were pursued, and the remaining cases were not pursued for a
variety of reasons, including lack of resources and
insufficient evidence.
Of the subjects pursued, about 60 percent resulted in
judgments or settlements. And, again, hospitals and other
medical facilities accounted for about 40 percent of the
judgments. None of the subjects were beneficiaries.
Turning to strategies to reduce fraud, we have identified
three, including strengthening provider enrollment processes
and standards; improving pre- and post-payment review of
claims; and developing processes to address identified
vulnerabilities.
CMS has made progress in each of these areas through
implementing provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the
Small Business Jobs Act. For example, CMS now has a process in
place to better screen providers before enrolling them in
Medicare. And it has implemented the fraud prevention system,
which detects suspicious claims before they are paid.
Still, further action is needed. We have made a number of
recommendations to CMS that have not been implemented, and we
continue to urge CMS to adopt them.
In addition, we have significant ongoing work designed to
assist CMS in its fraud-prevention efforts. We are currently
assessing the effectiveness of the prepayment edits CMS and its
contractors use to ensure that Medicare claims are paid
correctly the first time. We also have a study under way
examining how Federal agencies are allocating funds from the
Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program, as well as
evaluating the effectiveness of those efforts. And we are also
examining the effectiveness of CMS's fraud contractors, the
Zone Program integrity contractors.
Preventing and reducing fraud requires constant vigilance,
as a wide variety of providers are involved in fraud and those
intent on committing fraud will always seek new opportunities
to circumvent program safeguards. We urge CMS to continues its
efforts.
And this concludes my prepared statement. Thank you.
Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentlelady.

Mr. Pitts. Mr. Olson, you are recognized for 5 minutes for
an opening statement.

STATEMENT OF DAN OLSON

Mr. Olson. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Pitts, Ranking
Member Pallone, and congressional leaders. Thank you so much
for the opportunity to testify on the issue of examining
options to combat healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse within the
Medicare and Medicaid programs.
I am Dan Olson. I am the director of fraud prevention for
Health Information Designs, which is a national healthcare
analytics company. I oversee our product offering for fraud
called SURVEIL, and I have worked in the program integrity
field for over 17 years.
Thank you for entering my full comments, as I will
summarize today my testimony.
Today we recognize that healthcare fraud is indeed a
criminal problem. It is multidimensional and has many facets to
it. But I suggest to you today and recommend that we need a
multidimensional toolset to address healthcare fraud, waste,
and abuse. Within this toolset we need to have something that
is dynamic in nature, nimble to change, and responsive to
emerging trends.
Several items that I would suggest this morning are: the
traditional business rules, which has been in place for a long
time, which evaluates medical guidelines and Federal and State
policy. But to enhance this, we must have predictive models,
which are using past claims and billing behaviors to forecast
future actions. We must also include predictive analytics,
which is developing statistical models to identify unknown data
relationships. We must include link analysis, which identify
relationships between providers, billing entities, and
recipients, often where we can find kickbacks so they don't
become so prevalent. We must also incorporate clinical decision
support systems so that we no longer look at just volume-based
metrics but we look at clinical guidelines to identify areas
where patients are at risk for developing major medical issues.
I must caution, though, against the belief that the toolkit
can stand alone because simply it cannot. The toolkit must be
managed by a broad-based partnership that includes medical
professionals, includes legal entities, analytical
professionals, investigative entities, coding experts,
statisticians, et cetera. By so doing that, we will have a
toolkit that can address the multi facets of fraud, waste, and
abuse.
As has been mentioned, significant progress has already
been made in the healthcare world, but significant progress
needs to continue to be made. Healthcare fraud is dynamic; it
is not static. If we sit and do nothing or rely on what we have
done in the past, we will be behind the curve. We must
implement the following recommendations that I present this
morning.
First, we should continue to expand the Medicare Fraud
strike force at the Federal level, but not only that, we must
implement it at the State level. By implementing it at the
State level--and I would recommend that each of the regional
CMS offices oversee this--then we can improve upon and recover
greater than 1 percent of the overall Medicare and Medicaid
spend.
We must continue and I recommend to expand and fund the
Integrated Data Repository. The singular importance of this
alone can simply not be overstated. I recommend that CMS adopt
a regionalized approach to this implementation that will allow
for a more rapid development and will reduce the testing and
training time that is needed for deployment. It is estimated
that over $250 million can be accomplished in recoveries during
the initial year and over $100 million in successive years.
We must also continue to expand the do-not-pay list that
was originally implemented by including retired and sanctioned
Drug Enforcement Agency numbers. Estimated savings: $200
million.
Finally, we must also publish national and statewide
healthcare statistics. We have read time and again about
something called a national healthcare fraud hotspot, where we
see billings in excess of 3,000 percent or 2,000 percent. These
are absurd. We need to know this. This needs to be in front of
us so that we can act upon it.
In order to do this, I recommend that we establish baseline
thresholds at the provider level for Medicare and Medicaid;
that these threshold lists be updated regularly; and that they
be published on the CMS Web site so that fraud analysts can
further act on them and know what emerging trends and patterns
will be.
I would be happy to expand on any of these issues that I
presented this morning. I have also included these in much more
detail in the two white papers that are attached as appendices
to my testimony.
I would like to thank you, Congressman Pitts, Ranking
Member Pallone, and congressional leaders, for this opportunity
to present. And I look forward to the question-and-answer time
that will follow. Thank you.
Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentleman.

Mr. Pitts. Ms. Lavelle, you are recognized for 5 minutes
for an opening statement.

STATEMENT OF ALANNA M. LAVELLE

Ms. Lavelle. Thank you.
Chairman Pitts, Ranking Member Pallone, and members of the
subcommittee, I am Alanna Lavelle, director of special
investigations for WellPoint. Thank you for the opportunity to
provide our input and recommendations on detecting and
deterring fraud and abuse in the healthcare system.
Healthcare fraud is not a victimless crime. We all pay, and
we pay dearly. Costs extend beyond financial loss. People are
harmed by wasteful, inappropriate testing and treatment.
One of the significant strengths that we and other health
plans provide is the data available from our integrated
healthcare benefits. This allows us the ability to see the
entire healthcare spectrum and to spot trends and outliers.
We also have a dedicated fraud and abuse prevention team,
known as the Special Investigations Unit, SIU. I am one of the
lead investigators, and we are staffed by former Federal and
State law enforcement agents and medical professionals. We also
have a data analysis team.
Our goal at WellPoint is to prevent healthcare fraud and
abuse for the benefit of our members' health. And in order to
meet this goal, we have developed a number of different types
of programs to identify and prevent healthcare fraud and abuse,
three of which I will briefly describe.
First, we have our Controlled Substance Utilization
Monitoring Program and our Medicaid Restricted Recipient
Program. Prescription narcotic drug abuse is a national
epidemic today. Through these programs, we are helping identify
those who are engaged in or contributing to prescription drug
abuse and/or drug diversion.
For example, for our Medicaid plans, we have implemented a
restricted recipient program in which a member who within a 3-
month period visits 3 or more prescribers, 3 or more
pharmacies, and fills 10 or more controlled substance
prescriptions without a confirmed underlying medically
necessary condition, and we lock them into using only 1 primary
care physician as prescriber, 1 retail pharmacy of their
choice, and 1 hospital. Our case managers work directly with
providers and members. And to date, the program has saved lives
and many millions of dollars in emergency department visits
alone for drug-seeking behavior.
Second, we have recently contracted with a vendor to do
predictive modeling at WellPoint. The program uses advanced
neural network technology from FICO to identify previously
unknown and emerging fraud and abuse provider and member
schemes. Suspect providers and claims are reviewed to identify
potential fraud, waste, or abuse and investigated thoroughly.
Since we began using this tool just 6 months ago, we have
opened 90 investigations and have achieved $27 million in
projected savings. The return on the investment at this time is
well over 15 to 1.
And, finally, we take a multifaceted approach to identify
bogus providers who do not actually perform services for real
patients. Our provider database team alerts our investigators
as to the presence of new claims coming in for new labs, new
pharmacies, and new durable medical equipment suppliers, or
DMEs. And we provide a full background check as well as a
drive-by of the provider's purported office space. To date, in
the State of California alone, we at WellPoint have stopped
over 239 bogus DME providers before they were able to defraud
us.
So based on our experience in combating healthcare fraud
and abuse, we offer the following recommendations to enhance
future efforts throughout all sectors of health care.
First, we are supportive of giving CMS the authority to
establish a restricted recipient program in Medicare Part D for
those beneficiaries displaying a pattern of misutilization.
Second, we recommend that dually eligible beneficiaries
with evidence of drug-seeking behavior should be locked into
one managed care plan, rather than continue to be allowed to
switch plans on a monthly basis to evade detection.
Third, we support better coordination and cooperation among
CMS, DOJ, and all stakeholders.
And, finally, all expenses for health insurers' antifraud
and -abuse programs should be included as activities that
improve healthcare quality in the medical loss ratio
calculation since they reduce waste, which reduces the cost of
health care, and enhance patient safety by helping identify and
remove providers engaging in unsafe and fraudulent practices
from the healthcare system.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the committee for the
opportunity to testify today on behalf of WellPoint on this
critical issue and pledge our support in any efforts to make
the healthcare system financially viable and safe for our
members.

Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentlelady and recognizes
Mr. Saccoccio for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

STATEMENT OF LOUIS SACCOCCIO

Mr. Saccoccio. Thank you. And good morning, Chairman Pitts,
Ranking Member Pallone, and other distinguished members of the
subcommittee. I am grateful for the opportunity this morning to
discuss with you the various methods we believe can be
effective in combating healthcare fraud. In my testimony today,
I draw upon our organization's 27 years of experience
examining, understanding, and fighting healthcare fraud.
There is no silver bullet for defeating healthcare fraud. A
winning antifraud strategy for Medicare must be multifaceted
and include, as outlined in my written testimony, effective
information-sharing among private and public payers of health
care; the application of data analytics to healthcare claims;
rigorous screening of providers attempting to enter or continue
in the program; and a well-trained, adequate, and
multidisciplinary workforce. Also, as with prescription drug
fraud and diversion, solutions specially designed to address
different types of fraud must be developed.
I would like to focus on the first of these points in my
oral testimony, effective antifraud information-sharing among
public and private payers of health care.
Healthcare fraud does not discriminate between types of
medical coverage. The same schemes used to defraud Medicare and
Medicaid migrate to private insurance, and schemes perpetrated
against private insurers make their way into government
programs. Additionally, many private insurers and Medicare Part
C and D contractors provide Medicare coverage in the States,
making clear the intrinsic connection between private and
public interests on this issue.
The United States spends $2.8 trillion on health care
annually and generates billions of claims from well over a
million healthcare service and product providers. The vast
majority of these providers of services and products bill
multiple payers, both private and public. For example, a
healthcare provider may be billing Medicare, Medicaid, and
several private health plans in which it is a network provider,
and may also be billing other health plans as an out-of-network
provider.
However, when analyzing this provider's claims for
potential fraud and abuse, each payer is limited to the claims
it receives and adjudicates and is not privy to the claims
information collected by other payers. In this type of
environment, those intent on committing fraud bank on the
assumption that payers are not working together to collectively
connect the dots and uncover the true breadth of a scheme.
And it is precisely this reason why the sharing of
preventive and investigative information among payers is
crucial for effectively identifying and stopping healthcare
fraud. Payers, whether private or public, who limit the scope
of their antifraud information to data from their own
organization or agency are taking an uncoordinated and a
piecemeal approach to the problem.
NHCAA was formed in 1985 precisely for the purpose of
serving as a catalyst for antifraud information-sharing. My
written statement provides examples of the types of
information-sharing activities conducted by NHCAA.
The Department of Justice also has recognized the benefit
of private-public information-sharing. For example, many U.S.
attorneys offices sponsor healthcare fraud task forces that
hold routine information-sharing meetings. And when invited to
do so, private insurers often participate in these meetings to
gather and offer investigative insight.
Despite the Justice Department's general recognition of
information-sharing as an antifraud tool, many, including
NHCAA, saw the need to improve and expand the cooperation and
antifraud information-sharing between the private and public
sectors. After more than 2 years of discussions and meetings
involving several interested parties, including NHCAA, the new
Health Care Fraud Prevention Partnership was formally announced
on July 26th at the White House.
The Health Care Fraud Prevention Partnership represents a
joint HHS and DOJ initiative, bringing together antifraud
associations, private insurers, and government and law
enforcement agencies. The partnership's purpose will be to
exchange facts and information between the public and private
sectors in order to reduce the prevalence of healthcare fraud.
The partnership will also enable members to individually share
successful antifraud practices and effective methodologies and
strategies for detecting and preventing fraud.
NHCAA has forged collaborative relationships between the
private and public sectors for nearly 3 decades, and it is from
this perspective that we believe the Health Care Fraud
Prevention Partnership holds great promise. Just getting under
way, the partnership needs time to develop and to demonstrate
it can be successful. It needs consistent high-level support if
it is to realize the sorts of tangible results we believe it is
capable of.
Whether undertaken through NHCAA, regional task forces and
workgroups, or through the new Health Care Fraud Prevention
Partnership, antifraud information-sharing and cooperation
between the private and public sectors is essential to being
able to detect emerging scenes and trends at the earliest time
possible.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify this morning. I
would be happy to answer any questions that you might have.

Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentleman and now
recognizes Mr. Pattinson for 5 minutes for an opening
statement.

STATEMENT OF NEVILLE PATTINSON

Mr. Pattinson. Thank you, Chairman Pitts, Ranking Member
Pallone, and members of the subcommittee, for inviting me to
testify on the solution to the problems for Medicare waste,
fraud, and abuse. My name is Neville Pattinson, and I am the
senior vice president of Gemalto. And I am here today
representing the Secure ID Coalition.
Gemalto is the world's leader in digital security, with
over a billion people using our products every day. We develop
secure operating systems and run them on secure devices that
include smart cards, banking cards, U.S. passports, electronic
ID cards, and tokens.
Founded in 2005, the Secure ID Coalition is composed of
companies which make smart cards and attendant technologies. We
work with industry experts, public policy officials, and
government agencies to promote identity solutions that both
enable security and privacy protections. We are offering our
industry expertise in the area of contact smart cards, which
are used extensively throughout the Federal Government and
around the world to protect access to both physical and logical
assets as well as to protect personal information.
Our Nation's Medicare system is under attack. Medicare
abuse and fraud needlessly costs American taxpayers billions of
dollars every year. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services estimated in 2010 over $65 billion in improper Federal
payments were made through both the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. An April 2012 study published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association estimated that fraud and abuse
cost Medicare and Medicaid as much as $98 billion in 2011.
Despite these good-faith estimates, the true cost of fraud and
abuse in health care remains unknown.
If we are ever to curb the fraud within the Medicare
system, we need to start verifying those who are authorized to
provide services, verify those who are authorized to receive
benefits, and prevent those who are unauthorized from ever
entering the system. Unfortunately, our current inability to
address this fundamental identity and verification problem
leaves the Medicare system perpetually open to ongoing
exploitation. Programs to curb Medicare fraud without first
resolving the identity verification problem will ultimately
fail if we don't know who is a legitimate beneficiary and who
is not.
In order to get to the right track, we must structure the
Medicare system to prevent fraud before it happens. This will
not only save taxpayers billions of dollars every year, but
ensure that Medicare survives to serve Americans well into the
future. The Medicare Common Access Card Act, or the Medicare
CAC, H.R. 2925, introduced by Congressman Gerlach and
Congressman Blumenauerand Congressman Shimkus, is an important
bipartisan piece of legislation that looks to solve this
problem.
In short, it calls for a pilot program to modernize the
current Medicare card in order to verify both providers and
beneficiaries as legitimate participants in the program. In it,
five regional pilots would test upgrading the current paper
Medicare card to a secure smart card, similar to those used by
the DOD and all Federal employees.
The pilots would do three things. First, it would reduce
the number of fraudulent transactions by eliminating ways
criminals can scam Medicare. Secondly, it would create
significant efficiencies within the Medicare program, providing
enormous benefit to the legitimate providers and their
patients. And, lastly, and some would say most importantly, it
would remove the Social Security number from the front of the
Medicare card, immediately protecting seniors from identity
theft and fraud.
Here is how it would work. When checking out at the
doctor's office, the beneficiary inserts their upgraded
Medicare card into a reader and inputs their PIN code. The
provider simultaneously inserts their upgraded provider card
and scans perhaps their finger. This guarantees the transaction
is agreed to, authenticated, and is legitimate. It has been
electronically signed and encrypted and sent directly to CMS.
What enables the transaction of the high-level assurance is
a secure smart card embedded into the card. Smart cards are
based on established, nonproprietary, open standards widely
used by the Federal Government. Additionally, government
healthcare systems globally utilize smart cards. The French,
German, Taiwanese healthcare systems all use similar twin card
systems to eliminate fraud and increase efficiencies.
Smart cards are also widely used throughout the private
sector. Financial services companies worldwide issue debit
cards and credit cards to their consumers to prevent fraud and
abuse. American banks will be introducing these Chip and PIN
cards starting next year. But based on the savings reported by
the U.K. financial services industry, the use of smart cards in
that sector led to a reduction in overall fraud losses upwards
of 70 percent.
Mr. Chairman, I realize I am running out of time, and I beg
to continue for another minute.
Mr. Pitts. You may proceed.
Mr. Pattinson. Thank you, sir.
While industry experts believe that Medicare CAC will be
able to deliver similar results, it is entirely reasonable to
assume a cost savings of at least 50 percent. At the current
rate of fraud, that represents well over $30 billion a year.
We are not claiming this will eliminate fraud as we know
it, nor is it a panacea. You may hear of vulnerabilities of
otherwise resilient and stalwart systems. For that, our
security innovations are constantly improving to solve current
exploits and prevent future ones. The point is not to create an
invulnerable system. That is impossible. The point is to save
the Medicare system for the next generation.
Existing fraud-mitigation technologies currently used by
CMS cannot do it alone. We must prevent bad actors from getting
into the system to begin with. Contact smart cards are the
strongest, surest, proven, and most mature technology to do
that.
In conclusion, we are confident that a program such as
Medicare CAC will bring value to beneficiaries, providers, and
taxpayers alike. For beneficiaries, Medicare CAC ensures that
their sensitive personal information, including their Social
Security number, is protected by strong encryption that can
only be read by an authorized Medicare CAC card reader.
Providers will benefit from quicker processing of payments,
increased billing accuracy, and the protection of their
Medicare provider ID numbers. And taxpayers will ultimately
gain the most significant benefit: the reduction in fraud,
waste, and abuse within the Medicare system that can prevent
the loss of tens of billions of dollars every year.
Everone in Congress wants to preserve Medicare for the next
generation of beneficiaries. Medicare CAC does this without
having to raise taxes, eliminate benefits, or cut
reimbursements. In our opinion, it is the best outcome for all
possible solutions.
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the
subcommittee, I will be happy to answer questions that you may
have. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF MICHAEL H. TERZICH

Mr. Terzich. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member
Pallone, and members of the subcommittee. My name is Michael
Terzich, and I am the senior vice president of global sales and
marketing for Zebra Technologies Corporation, which is
headquartered outside of Chicago in Lincolnshire, Illinois.
I greatly appreciate the opportunity to testify today and
share my company's perspective on how secure ID card technology
can help address the problem of fraud, waste, and abuse in the
healthcare system and, more specifically, the Medicare program.
My company commends you, Mr. Chairman, along with Ranking
Member Pallone, for your leadership on this issue. We likewise
wish to express our appreciation to your colleague from our
home State of Illinois, Congressman John Shimkus, who has
worked diligently----
Mr. Pitts. Could you pull your microphone a little closer
to you? Thank you.
Mr. Terzich [continuing]. Who has worked diligently on this
issue and has been a key leader in efforts to eliminate
healthcare and Medicare fraud.
As a global leader in the secure ID digital printer
industry, Zebra designs and manufactures a variety of products
that use sophisticated technology to safeguard identity and
streamline business processes. As a result, I will focus my
remarks on H.R. 2925, the Medicare Common Access Card Act,
which, as you know, would establish a pilot program to test the
potential security benefits associated with modernizing
Medicare through the use of secure ID card technology.
Zebra believes that this kind of technology will help
protect the continued integrity of the Medicare program. Our
confidence reflects the fact that technology enjoys a strong
record of performance in both the Federal Government and the
private sector. From the Department of Defense's use of secure
identity credentials for logical and physical access to vital
defense facilities and data networks, to the work of global
credit card companies in advancing combined Chip and PINsystems
which protect the integrity of both personal identity and
financial transactions, secure ID technology provides a tested
platform that Medicare can leverage in advancing efforts to
combat fraud, waste, and abuse.
Moreover, our experience in the private sector is that the
digitization of business processes within Medicare will also
help reduce the overall cost of operating the Medicare system.
On this point, we associate ourselves with the testimony from
our colleagues in the Secure ID Coalition, who address this
point in greater detail in their statement.
Let me briefly turn to three key technical elements of
secure identification that the subcommittee may wish to
consider as it advances H.R. 2925.
The first is the value of leveraging the experience the
Federal Government has gained over the past decade in improving
identity security. In particular, we believe that the Federal
Information Processing Standard Publication 201, better known
by its acronym FIPS 201, and its subsidiary standards known as
Personal Identity Verification 1, Personal Identity
Verification 2, and Personal Identity Verification
Interoperable, also known by their acronyms, PIV-1, PIV-2, and
PIV-I, provide a proven framework for providing secure identity
management technology into the fight against Medicare fraud.
Since 2005, the Federal Government has issued millions of
FIPS 201 and standard PIV cards to Federal employees and
contractors covering a wide range of trusted identity
applications. Given the Federal Government's significant and
positive experience in using PIV-based secure ID technology
elsewhere, we believe it makes sense to employ the FIPS 201
standard in the pilot program that is created by H.R. 2925.
Second is the recognition of the value that secure ID card
technology brings to the fight against counterfeiting and
identity theft. Counterfeiting secure ID cards is exponentially
more difficult than counterfeiting paper-based cards, even for
the most sophisticated, well-financed criminal enterprises.
This enhanced security comes from a combination of media
features, printer capabilities, and coding of encrypted data on
the smart chip database verification, and secure methods and
processes. H.R. 2925's pilot program will provide an
opportunity to test these features and determine the best
combination for the Medicare system.
Third, Mr. Chairman, both security and efficiency are
substantially enhanced through the use of a decentralized print
model, which provides a realtime tie between the creation of a
secure ID card and the immediate verification of the
cardholder's information. Delays or gaps in time between these
two steps, which inevitably occur when cards are manufactured
in a remote centralized manner, increase opportunities that can
be otherwise reduced through the use of a decentralized print
model.
In sum, Mr. Chairman, secure ID card technology enables the
use of tested security features which enhance privacy and
identity protection. PIV-compliant secure ID cards provide
secure, multifactor authentication at a high level of assurance
by combining cryptographic private authentication with a
personal identification number in a durable, tamper-resistant
card format. Once a secure ID card is programmed and associated
with a user, it provides a trusted, authentical identity usable
for a wide range of cyber-based and physical transactions.
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to
testify today. We stand ready to assist the subcommittee in
developing legislative language related to the technical issues
I have mentioned and urge the subcommittee to report out H.R.
2925 with modifications early next year. I look forward to any
questions you or your colleagues may have.

STATEMENT OF KEVIN FU

Mr. Fu. Good morning, Chairman Pitts, Ranking Member
Pallone, and distinguished members of the subcommittee. Thank
you for the invitation to testify on the expectations of smart
cards to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare
program.
My name is Kevin Fu. I teach courses on smart cards and how
to build secure computer systems in health care. While studying
at MIT 17 years ago, I helped a hospital deploy a smart-card
precursor to authenticate healthcare providers. My
responsibility included issuing replacement authentication
cards to nurses and physicians who would lose their cards. I am
speaking today as an individual.
While smart cards may reduce fraud in other sectors, there
do remain challenges that may make deployment more costly and
less effective than anticipated. One, smart cards authenticate
smart cards, not people. The cards can still be borrowed or
stolen. Two, there are several hacks against smart cards that
have led to fraud and cloned credentials. And three,
interrupting the clinical workflow can lead to unanticipated
consequences on patient care that need to be investigated.
So let me highlight the types of fraud remaining in
healthcare programs in other countries who have already
deployed smart cards for their national health programs.
Further details do appear in my written testimony.
In France, it was routine for people to share smart cards.
Many healthcare professionals still do not have the smart-card
readers after nearly 15 years. In such cases, a patient in
France uses an ancient paper-based system for reimbursement.
Thus, loopholes remain for fraud, and the French maintain two
separate payment processing systems.
In Taiwan, fraud persists because multiple patients collude
with one or more doctors to report higher examination and
medication fees such that they can split the extra money among
themselves. Even a secure smart card cannot stop that kind of
fraud.
In Germany this past summer, the smart-card deployment
proved difficult when the manufacturer accidentally distributed
cards without PINs to 2 million patients. All the smart cards
required replacement.
In Britain, a survey found that general practitioners and
staff share their National Health Service smart cards despite
warnings of disciplinary action.
And in Australia, they recently terminated its $25 million
contract last month for their national eHealth program using a
smart-card authentication service.
Mr. Fu. Let me also highlight a few security shortcomings
in smart cards just to give you an idea of what could be
expected.
In 2011, the DOD Common Access Card was suggested as a
model approach for the Medicare Common Access Card. This was a
valid approach. But 2 months later, a Chinese computer virus
hacked into the computers connected to smart-cards readers to
steal PINs from the military cards.
Security, I teach my students, is very difficult to measure
or predict and a common property of the hacked smart-card
system is that the smart-card system was previously believed to
be secure.
In 2006, I culled out a study that analyzed the security of
credit cards containing contact-less smart-card technology. The
New York Times reported that card companies imply through their
marketing that the data was encrypted to make sure that a
digital eavesdropper could not get any intelligible
information. But instead we found that we could wirelessly scan
the credit cards through clothing with a tiny device built with
$150 in spare parts.
The Chip and PIN system deployed overseas has also
experienced several security flaws that led to fraud. The BBC
reported that cards were found to be open to a form of cloning
despite past assurances from banks that Chip and PIN could not
be compromised. Hundreds of Chip and PIN machines in stores and
supermarkets across Europe have been tampered with to relay
credit card data to overseas fraudsters to make cash
withdrawals.
With implications to public health, my understanding is
that a significant source of fraud comes from home healthcare
services. A home healthcare patient who cannot remember to eat
breakfast on his own is not going to be able to remember a PIN
or password. A stroke victim who must relearn how to swallow
may not be able to talk or feed herself without assistance. The
home healthcare patient depends greatly on the kindness of
others and can be particularly vulnerable to overly trusting a
provider.
In short, a vulnerable home healthcare patient would likely
comply with an unscrupulous provider who asked to hold onto the
card and PIN so as not to inconvenience the patient.
I have four recommendations.
A pilot study should include a security analysis and
penetration testing of the system by a neutral third party as
well as tests designed with clinical engineers and health IT
specialists to measure the impact on patient care.
Two, a pilot study should measure fraud in comparison with
alternatives.
And three, a smart-card pilot should measure the impact on
fraud while controlling for fraud reductions due to other fraud
detection systems.
And four, there should be a period of public feedback
coordinated by a neutral third party who has no financial
interest in the outcome of the selected technology. NIST may be
a logical choice, given that the proposed legislation refers to
NIST standards.
So thank you. Let me conclude. And I am happy to answer any
questions you may have.
Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentleman.

Mr. Pitts. That concludes the opening testimony. We will
now begin questioning, and I will recognize myself 5 minutes
for that purpose.
Ms. King, in 2010, the Obama administration announced that
CMS would cut the Medicare improper payment rate in half by
2012, an error rate that led them to conclude $60 billion in
improper payments that were made.
It is almost December of 2012. And knowing that GAO has
just released a report on this demonstration project, can you
tell us why the administration failed to release its mandated
October report?
Ms. King. Sir, you are referring to the Predictive
Analytics Report?
Mr. Pitts. I am sorry?
Ms. King. You are referring to the Predictive Analytics
Report----
Mr. Pitts. Yes.
Ms. King [continuing]. That was due to Congress?
I can't speak for them. I do know that it has not been
submitted yet.
Mr. Pitts. Has the administration met their goal of
improper payment rates being reduced by half by 2012?
Ms. King. No, they have not.
Mr. Pitts. What did your report reveal?
Ms. King. Well, the improper payments rate is produced by
HHS. And that is not--the 2012 number was just released. And I
do know that they did not meet their rate, that the rate for
2012 was 8.5 percent or $29 billion, which was slightly lower
in percentage terms but higher in dollar amounts than the 2011.
Mr. Pitts. Now, Mr. Olson, in 2010, then-acting Deputy
Attorney General Gary Grindler stated that, quote, ``It is not
enough just to prosecute and punish healthcare fraud after it
occurs, we must target it before it happens through aggressive
prescreening, auditing, and prevention techniques,'' end quote.
An all-of-the-above strategy, if you will, and while much
public attention has been given to post-payment recovery
efforts under this administration, do you believe that we are
doing enough in aggressive prescreening and prevention
techniques, and what priorities do you recommend?
Mr. Olson. I believe that we have made a good start. But I
believe that there is significant progress that needs to be
made.
The prescreening methods that have been put in place are
good to identify the low, medium, and high providers that are
at risk. I still believe this is a beginning point and there
needs to be much progress that would be made there. As well
with the predictive analytics, I believe it is a starting
point. I believe it is a good step that is being taken, but yet
much more needs to be done, and I believe we are seeing that
with the fraud prevention system that is in place. But it will
continue to grow, and as the years roll on, that we will
continue to see more activity in that area.
Mr. Pitts. Ms. Lavelle, you mentioned in your testimony
that data sharing between public and private entities is very
important for fraud prevention. Medicare Advantage seems like a
good example of where public and private payers meet.
What sorts of data sharing occur between Medicare and
Medicare Advantage plan companies? And do you believe that data
sharing could be improved between the two to improve fraud
prevention? If so, how?
Ms. Lavelle. Mr. Chairman, I do believe there is a need to
improve some of the sharing. We work through the NHCAA to share
amongst all payers. And we do, as private payers, share with
the government. However, oftentimes it is just a one-way street
and we do not get the information back that we need. For
example, if they suspend or revoke a provider, we continue to
pay because we do not know who they have suspended or who they
have revoked.
Oftentimes, the Department of Justice will have an ongoing
criminal case and we will not be allowed to intervene with that
payer during this long criminal investigation and we continue
to pay bad claims.
And thirdly, there are a number of whistleblower lawsuits
that involve patient harm. And until that qui tam lawsuit is
unsealed, we cannot do any intervention with our providers that
may be causing harm to our members.
Mr. Pitts. OK. Now, you mentioned in your testimony the
Controlled Substance Utilization Monitoring Program and
limiting documented prescription drug abusers to one pharmacy
and one prescriber as a mechanism to prescription drug abuse
and to stop the costs associated with doctor shopping.
Does Medicare Advantage or Part D plans allow insurers to
implement a similar type of program? If not, do you know why?
Ms. Lavelle. Not at this time. We have sought to get
authority to do that. But at this time, they have not
authorized that type of lock-in program.
And, generally speaking, our biggest problems are with the
dual eligibles between the age of 20 and 40. They not
necessarily are seniors. But these are the folks that have the
addiction problem and are overdosing, basically.
Mr. Pitts. Thank you. My time has expired.
Chair recognize Ranking Member Mr. Pallone for 5 minutes
for questions.
Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I wanted to ask Ms. King initially, one of the witnesses
today, I guess it was Mr. Pattinson, noted that by requiring
identity verification of providers and beneficiaries, Medicare
would easily eliminate more than 50 percent of the fraud within
the current system.
Do you believe, you know, that that is fairly accurate or
would a verification process eliminate that much of current
fraud?
Ms. King. First, I do not think we really--there is no
reliable estimate of how much fraud there is in the healthcare
system. So half of a total that we do not know, it is hard to
say what that would be.
Secondly, I think that we just identified for the first
time the types of providers that were involved in healthcare
fraud. And no one, to my knowledge, has done an in-depth
analysis of what the causes of fraud might be.
So I think it would be premature to say that you could
eliminate 50 percent of the fraud based just on identity theft,
because we do not know the extent to which identity theft
contributes to healthcare fraud.
Mr. Pallone. Let me ask Ms. Lavelle about WellPoint's anti-
fraud initiatives. Does WellPoint use a smart card for
beneficiaries like the one envisioned by the Medicare Common
Access Card legislation?
Ms. Lavelle. Mr. Pallone, we are on shifting sands right
now with emerging technologies in the healthcare arena. We
decided in the past year to pick up a predictive analytic
modeling tool. And, to date, we haven't explored the smart
card. We are exploring other sophisticated methods in the
future, including an app that might go on a smart phone or an
iPad. But we are still analyzing all the tools out there.
Mr. Pallone. Are you aware of any of the Blues' plans that
require beneficiary and provider smart cards? Do they use them?
Ms. Lavelle. I am not aware of any that do, no.
Mr. Pallone. As opposed to spending money on cards and card
readers, where has WellPoint invested its anti-fraud dollars?
If you had to pick one activity that you believe gives you the
best bang for the buck, what would that be? And do you have any
sense of your return on investment for these anti-fraud
activities?
Ms. Lavelle. Our most valuable tool at this time is our
predictive analytic modeling tool. We are finding anomalies in
systems, we are finding aberrant providers that are basically
committing fraud. We are finding weaknesses in our own systems,
in our own contracts, and in our own medical policies, things
that we can urgently change to save dollars on an enterprise-
wide basis.
Mr. Pallone. Do you have any idea of the return on the
investment, though, in terms of that?
Ms. Lavelle. It is well over 15 to 1 at this point.
Mr. Pallone. OK.
And then I wanted to ask Dr. Fu, I noticed in your
testimony how a number of instances of fraud were committed
when card readers were tampered with. Seems to me that placing
multiple card readers in every physician's office just invites
the opportunity for more fraud. Even an unsuspecting physician
could be victimized by a faulty card reader. While that may not
be happening today, isn't it conceivable that that is a danger
in the future?
Mr. Fu. That is a potential risk because of the software
that is associated with the card readers and the connections
that different components make into the clinical computing
systems.
Mr. Pallone. I am also concerned about the costs of
implementing a smart-card system for all of Medicare. There is
the cost of issuing the cards, the fingerprinting a million-
plus physicians and new physicians, possibly the costs of
getting photos of beneficiaries for the cards, and the card
readers, not to mention the system changes that Medicare would
need to make to accept information from this new technology.
From your experience in working in a medical setting, do
you think it is reasonable to assume that each provider office
would only need one card reader or do you think estimates of
one card reader per office are a bit understated?
Mr. Fu. I would suspect that providers would need more card
readers than they originally anticipated. I say that because 17
years ago, when we rolled out a similar system in a community
hospital, that was one of the areas where it was underestimated
how many card readers we needed, as well as how many cards we
needed to purchase, too, because the physicians and nurses
would inevitably misplace the cards.
Mr. Pallone. Let me just go back to Ms. King.
One of the things that I believe is important to keep in
mind as we design our anti-fraud arsenal is that fraud is
multifaceted.
Could you just take a moment to describe the different
kinds of fraud that is perpetrated against the Medicare
program? I know I am almost out of time, but as briefly as you
can.
Ms. King. According to the Inspector General, there are
lots of different kinds of fraud, but they include billing for
services that aren't needed or not provided. There are kickback
schemes where people sell their numbers, sell their beneficiary
numbers.
But, you know, there is a broad spectrum of fraud that is
committed. But I don't think there has been a comprehensive
analysis done that really drills down on all the types of fraud
that have been identified. And there is, of course, a lot of
fraud that goes unidentified because it is under the radar.
People are committing acts that would be fraud that are not
detected.
Mr. Pallone. All right. Thanks a lot.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentleman and recognizes
Dr. Burgess for 5 minutes for questions.
Mr. Burgess. I thank the chairman for the recognition.
Ms. King, thank very much for being here. Thank you for
your testimony today.
Now, you gave us an impression in your spoken testimony
that you have provided CMS a list of items that they might
consider doing in order to implement the programs that they
said that they are already implementing. Did I understand that
correctly?
Ms. King. Yes. We have a number of recommendations that we
made to them.
Mr. Burgess. Would it be appropriate for GAO to provide
this committee with an itemized list of those things they have
sent to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in order
to get to the bottom of some of these inappropriate payments?
Ms. King. We would be happy to.
Mr. Burgess. Now, to date, has CMS replied to your
provision? You have provided this information to CMS. Is it a
two-way street? Are they coming back to you with the
information?
Ms. King. If we issue a report that has recommendations,
the agency always has a chance to comment on them. And usually
they either agree or disagree. And then we have an annual
process where we follow up with them once a year to see whether
they have implemented recommendations.
Mr. Burgess. Well, that is really my question, that
opportunity to agree or disagree.
In your bibliography, you referenced another report you did
last month about Medicare fraud prevention, CMS has implemented
a predictive analytic system.
In your recommendations part, you said HHS agreed to
described action CMS was taking to address the recommendations.
But my problem is, we have been talking about this for the 10
years that I have been here and we are not getting anywhere.
So how do they provide you with definitive actions that
they are going--do they provide you with definitive actions
that they are going to take that are associated with metrics
where we could all know that they are doing what they said they
were going to do?
Ms. King. When we do our annual follow-up on
recommendations, we engage in a rigorous process with them to
determine whether, in fact, they have adopted recommendations.
Mr. Burgess. When was this last annual report generated by
CMS?
Ms. King. We do our recommendation----
Mr. Burgess. I am sorry, your----
Ms. King. We do our recommendation follow-up each year in
the fall.
Mr. Burgess. OK. So is there a recent one that has been
provided?
Ms. King. That is an internal document to GAO. But we track
that and we would be happy to provide you with a list of
recommendations and the status of the follow-up.
Mr. Burgess. That is what I was getting at. Thank you.
And, Mr. Chairman, I would like for those to be provided
and made part of the record and made available to every member
of the committee, because I do think that it is important.
We are all talking about the fact that we are just a few
months away from Elysian Fields of the Affordable Care Act, and
everyone is going to have everything that they ever wanted. But
I don't know quite the number of States that have agreed to do
their own exchanges, but there is a big number of States--I
know my State is not going to do a State exchange--so there are
a number that will fall into whatever this Federal fallback
position is, which looks a lot like the public option.
And one of the concerns I had about the public option when
we talked about in this committee during a markup on H.R. 3200,
which was the healthcare bill that didn't become law, one of
the big concerns I had with the public option was we got a lot
of problem right now with inappropriate payment in Medicare.
Why in the world would we expand another public program before
we get our hands around this problem?
So I know the GAO does not speculate and they don't engage
in conjecture. But do you have a feeling about what the future
holds just a short year from now as those large public options
come online?
Ms. King. Sir, I would have to say not yet.
Mr. Burgess. Well, I was afraid of that answer. OK.
Ms. Lavelle, let me ask you, because you are WellPoint. You
are private sector. Is your company going to be developing a
product that will be available in the State exchanges?
Ms. Lavelle. I am not certain at this point. But I can find
out and have someone get back with you on that.
Mr. Burgess. Then, of course, along the same line of
reasoning, you know, would you participate in a Federal
exchange if there were this large Federal fallback that were
provided to States that weren't going to set up their
exchanges?
My understanding is this will be set up through the Office
of Personnel Management, not through HHS. This is a pretty
little-known and little-understood Federal agency right now
that administers the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan. But
it is fixing to become an enormous Federal agency that will
administer a problem--a problem---- sorry, Freudian slip--a
program that is every bit as big as what CMS administers today
in the Medicare system.
So I would assume a company like yours would look at that
and say, this is market share, we have got to be a participant
in this.
But at the same time, you have got this other problem with
the medical loss ratio rules that are there in the Affordable
Care Act. And I assume your company has looked at those medical
loss ratios rules because they probably do affect you, do they
not?
Ms. Lavelle. Yes. Absolutely.
Mr. Burgess. So if you spend money on fraud prevention, is
that money scored as an administrative expense or a healthcare
expense?
Ms. Lavelle. We can only count the dollars up to the amount
of recovery we bring in each year. So if we bring in, you know,
$2 million, that is all we can count outside of the
administrative costs.
Mr. Burgess. I think you gave us a figure of ROI, of return
on investment, of 15 to 1. So, presumably, that would be
something you would pursue even in light of the MLR rules. Is
that correct? Or is the MLR going to be an inhibitory factor
for you?
Ms. Lavelle. It continues to be inhibiting, based on our
growth. We do a lot of quality of care investigations. We have
found diluted chemo drugs. We have cases on cardiologists doing
unnecessary stents, unnecessary bilateral cardiac caths. Maybe
half of our work deals with quality of care and patient harm.
And that is why we feel we should get some credit for some of
the work and the prevention that we do.
Mr. Burgess. I couldn't agree with you more.
Mr. Chairman, I would just submit, at some point, we
perhaps need to have a much wider evaluation of these medical
loss ratio rules and how they affect. I mean, you are talking
about patients--you are not just talking about fraud, you are
talking about patient safety.
Ms. Lavelle. Exactly.
Mr. Burgess. We just had a big hearing in Oversight
Investigations on patient safety because of some altered
steroids in the compounding pharmacy. Patients depend upon us
to be their watchdogs on this. And the fact that you feel that
this is something that is being inhibited by the Affordable
Care Act, we need to get on top of that.
Now I will yield back my time.
Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentleman and now
recognizes the gentlelady from Illinois, Ms. Schakowsky, for 5
minutes for questions.
Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Ms. King, I wanted to ask you a question. I think the
chairman was getting at whether or not the administration has
met its goals. And so the issue of how does one measure the
effectiveness of fraud reduction measures. And I wanted to ask
you about this.
Those that prevent fraud from happening, how would we
measure that? For example, since March of 2011, CMS has
deactivated 136,682 provider enrollments and revoked 12,447
enrollments, taking away their billing privileges because of, I
guess, identifying them as fraudsters. And they no longer have
the privilege of billing Medicare.
So how would we calculate, or can we calculate, what kind
of savings are realized by this revocation of billing
privileges or any other kind of prevention measure that we
might take?
Ms. King. I think there are a number of steps that CMS has
taken that are in the prevention category. And one thing is
strengthening provider enrollments and standards so that you
are keeping out people from the get-go who shouldn't be
providing services to the program.
So it is hard, you are right, it is hard to measure, well,
you know, what might they have billed had they been allowed.
And I think on the other side another example is the Fraud
Prevention System, the Predictive Analytic System. If you are
preventing things from happening, then how do you measure the
magnitude of that? And I think that is something that CMS is
working on and struggling with, but it is a difficult issue.
Ms. Schakowsky. I think it is really, really important that
we do that. And I think everyone on both sides of the aisle
agree we need to do better. But I think it is also important
that we get the metrics right so that we properly evaluate the
measures that we are taking.
Let me ask you a question, Dr. Fu. As you know, the smart-
card industry has legislation that would mandate CMS undertake
a specific demonstration project to pilot their technology in
five States.
I am not a researcher, but it would seem to me that the
bill could be made better in this fashion. It seems that
testing one particular intervention against doing nothing
likely will yield results. But it seems to me that the better
question that Medicare and Congress should be exploring is
testing one technology against another technology.
So wouldn't it make more sense to test different
interventions against each other to see which one is best?
Mr. Fu. So in my written testimony, I have some further
comments on that. I can highlight that.
I agree, it would be more telling if the experiment were
comparative as opposed to absolute.
In particular, commingling the fraud reduction from the
predictive analytics may make it more difficult to understand
where is the reduction coming from, from the analytics or from
the smart card. So it should not be conflated with the benefits
from other anti-fraud mechanisms.
There are some other technologies one could try. I would
say none of them are surefire. But it is a valid question to
ask.
I believe one comment that was raised today was the issue
of using a mobile app. And I have heard of suggestions of using
an inexpensive photo ID. They all have problems. They all have
benefits. But it is good to know the comparative.
Mr. Pattinson. I would just like to add to Dr. Fu's
comments that the smart-card technology is well proven around
the world. Everybody in this room probably has at least one of
them on your person in the form of a SIM card in your phone. It
is in the U.S. passport. The Federal Government is using them
to protect all of their infrastructure.
So this is not testing a technology on the basis of does it
work or not. Smart cards work in this situation for
authentication and for identification. We are certainly not
saying they should be done alone, and we agree that they should
be done in conjunction with other technologies as they emerge.
They can be included.
But at the moment, this is an easy thing to help save the
Medicare system a great deal of money very quickly with proven
technology, even though under H.R. 2925, we are only asking for
a pilot because we want everybody to be confident that we can
build the best system to save the most money to preserve the
longevity of Medicare.
Ms. Schakowsky. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks the gentlelady.
Now recognizes Dr. Cassidy for 5 minutes for questions.
Mr. Cassidy. Thank you all for being here.
Ms. Lavelle, WellPoint has MA plans. And do you have the
same level of fraud, waste, and abuse in your MA plans that you
administer for CMS as is reported to occur in direct fee-for-
service Medicare?
Ms. Lavelle. That is difficult to answer, Congressman.
We are very vigilant with our MA plan. We have a lot of
rigorous applications, data mining programs we run against it.
One of the common denominators and one of our biggest
issues is the ``any willing provider'' clause that allows any
willing provider to bill.
Mr. Cassidy. Are you allowed to do precertificaiton,
preauthorization even if you have an ``any willing provider''?
Ms. Lavelle. On certain procedures, yes.
Mr. Cassidy. OK. OK. So you are not sure, possibly, but
just not sure.
Ms. Lavelle. Well, I am not certain if our level of fraud
in MA is the same as CMS.
Mr. Cassidy. Got you.
Ms. Lavelle. It is just hard to determine.
Mr. Cassidy. OK. Now, everybody is familiar with McAllen,
Texas, immortalized in the New Yorker as a place with a lot of
CMS fraud, waste, or abuse. But there is a health affairs
article, first author is Franzini, looking at the Blue Cross
population. And in this actually McAllen, Texas, had a 7
percent lower utilization rate than El Paso.
Now, it seems like if Blue Cross is 7 percent lower in a
place where--I forget the exact number--but where McAllen is
like 180 percent higher than El Paso, that the problem is CMS,
frankly. And the authors of the paper at the end postulate what
could be the problem. Some of them are reflected in your GAO
report.
Would you like to render an opinion on that?
Ms. Lavelle. I am not familiar with the article, so I'd
rather not.
Mr. Cassidy. What would be your estimate of why Blue Cross
Texas has 7 percent lower expenditures in McAllen, whereas CMS
has, again, I wish I had looked at--80 percent or 180 percent
higher than the cohort city, if you will, the comparison city?
Ms. Lavelle. I think we do have some sophisticated tools in
place that stop the dollars before they go out the door.
Mr. Cassidy. So that suggests that CMS does not.
Ms. Lavelle. No. I am not suggesting they do not. But we
are very competitive in the Blues. And we are very
collaborative between States in warning each other, giving
early warning signals. But we do have very rigorous special
investigation----
Mr. Cassidy. Got you. The only reason I am cutting you off
is time is limited. And it does seem as if the Blues have
something that CMS does not, which is a little daunting when we
figure we are turning over our healthcare system to them.
You mention in your testimony, I think it was you, about
the duel eligibles being able to change Part D plans month to
month. And so those seeking drugs will try and stay one step
ahead.
Ms. Lavelle. Yes.
Mr. Cassidy. Do you have an estimate of how much money we
would save? Because prescription drug abuse is a huge problem.
Ms. Lavelle. It is.
Mr. Cassidy. Do you have an estimate of how much we would
save were we to limit that activity?
Ms. Lavelle. I don't have an estimate. But I can tell you
that a single provider that we lock into place with a single ER
for nonemergency use, we could save at least 300,000 to 400,000
a year based on----
Mr. Cassidy. Three hundred, four hundred thousand what?
Ms. Lavelle. Dollars a year, per member.
Mr. Cassidy. Per member.
Ms. Lavelle. For locking them in. They evade the lock-ins
by jumping from WellPoint to Humana to Aetna.
Mr. Cassidy. You would save $300,000 per member, per year?
Ms. Lavelle. For every dollar we spend on drugs, we have
determined that we spend approximately $41 on facility fees.
Mr. Cassidy. And any clue the size of this population that
you would save $300,000 per year on? I mean, is it a thousand
people? Is it a million people?
Ms. Lavelle. It is hard to say. But it is----
Mr. Cassidy. Ballpark.
Ms. Lavelle. We probably have a thousand right now that we
are monitoring. And we just don't have the manpower to
monitor----
Mr. Cassidy. So a thousand times 300. We are talking about
real change here----
Ms. Lavelle. Yes.
Mr. Cassidy [continuing]. For one company. Granted, a big
one.
Ms. Lavelle. Right.
Mr. Cassidy. Dr. Fu, I really liked your testimony, man. I
will tell you, the TWIC card was supposedly going to be the
answer for all security problems, and I get regular complaints
from people fighting about the TWIC card. And I like the way
you kind of, if you will, puncture a couple holes in its
foolproofness.
Is there anything short of a retinal scan that could
actually make a secure ID card? Because you mentioned, if
somebody gives their card to somebody else and they can take
that number, et cetera, et cetera.
Mr. Fu. Thank you, sir.
Identity is very difficult to establish. In computer
security, there are three basic ways to do it. You can use
something you have, like a smart card; something you know, like
a password; or something you are, like a fingerprint. Whereas
we also like to call it something you lost, something you can't
remember, and something you were.
But I would say that the difficulty is in how the smart-
card system is used in the greater system. So it doesn't matter
if you have the most secure technology or even if there is a
flaw, if that system is put as a component in a larger system
that it itself has flaws. For instance, a paper-based----
Mr. Cassidy. Got you.
Mr. Fu [continuing]. Alternative system would leave that
door open to fraud.
Mr. Cassidy. But still within that, there has to be--and
you point that out--there has to be things about the card
itself even in a perfect system that can make that system
vulnerable.
So I go back to again is anything besides the fingerprint
or a retinal scan going to give you the assurance that somebody
sitting at a computer terminal is just not filing claims for
things not done?
Mr. Fu. Unfortunately, despite decades of research in
computer security, there is no silver bullet. There is no
surefire way to establish identity. I think one of the reasons
that certain identity cards work well in buildings is that you
may have police nearby or people watching or people who would
catch you.
So I don't have a good answer for you on what would work
better. I do think it is a good idea to try different
alternatives because different contexts you will see different
technologies having different advantages.
Mr. Cassidy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize for going
over.
Mr. Pitts. Thank you. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York, Mr.
Engel, for 5 minutes for questions.
Mr. Engel. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Saccoccio, in your testimony, one of your
recommendations is that we ensure a skilled and sufficient
workforce of anti-fraud professionals. My sense is that no
matter how much we invest in front-end screening or technology
solutions, we will still have a need for those boots on the
ground.
There are providers who look legitimate on paper and it is
only until an unannounced visit that we discover something is
wrong. Sometimes it is not until a beneficiary is interviewed
or calls to report something suspicious that investigators get
a hint of problems.
So my question is, can you talk about what kind of anti-
fraud workforce CMS should maintain? Do you believe additional
investments in anti-fraud funding, including for personnel,
would be valuable to help fight Medicare fraud?
Mr. Saccoccio. Yes. Thank you for the question.
I definitely agree that technology is not the silver
bullet. It is a tool that has to be used. Predictive analytics
is important. It is going to give you a lot of leads. But once
you get those leads from the technology, you need the people to
examine those leads.
I don't know of any system right now where you could just
flip a switch and based on the information you get back from a
computer be able to automatically deny a claim or suspend a
claim until there is some sort of investigation done.
So you definitely need folks that are very savvy with
technology, experts in technology. You need folks able to
analyze data that is generated, statisticians, those types of
folks. You need folks that have clinical backgrounds, because
as a few of the witnesses talked about, a lot of the issues
involve quality of care, necessary care. So you need folks that
have clinical backgrounds.
And then you need investigators, folks that know how to do
investigations, folks that can go out into the field and ask
questions and visit sites where potentially you have phantom
providers or fraudulent providers.
So you need a mix of workforce. So definitely any resources
that are put into this, some have to be focused on technology.
But you also have to ensure that you have the right type of
workforce to go out there and conduct the investigations and
validate the information that the technology is feeding you.
Mr. Engel. Thank you.
Let me ask you again, Mr. Saccoccio, and also Ms. King, the
Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions designed to
promote data sharing between agencies, the Federal Government,
and the States, and also various Federal healthcare programs.
And it also, as you know, provides new tools and strengthens
penalties against fraudulent providers.
The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that
these anti-fraud provisions when fully implemented will save
American taxpayers $7 billion over the next 10 years.
So let me ask you again, Mr. Saccoccio, and also Ms. King,
what specific aspects of fraud detection do you think are being
most positively impacted by the provisions in the Affordable
Care Act and what additional steps do you believe Congress
should take to enable better fraud detection and prevention?
Ms. King, why don't we start with you.
Ms. King. Yes. Well, one of the key provisions of the
Affordable Care Act was a set of provisions strengthening the
ability of CMS to screen providers before they are enrolled in
the program. So you are ensured that you are only getting
legitimate providers in the program.
And as part of that process, CMS also contracted with a
couple of contractors to do onsite inspections to go up, you
know, for high-risk providers to make sure that they are, in
fact, legitimate businesses and to automate the enrollment
process more quickly so that you can see before you enroll
someone whether they are on the do-not-pay or the excluded
list.
So those kinds of things I think have a good bit of
potential.
Mr. Engel. Thank you.
Mr. Saccoccio?
Mr. Saccoccio. Yes. I think the biggest thing in the
Affordable Care Act, as Ms. King mentioned, is the ability,
giving CMS greater ability to screen providers coming into the
program.
And I think some of that is going to require, depending on
how you establish--when you look at different providers, you
have to establish potential risks from those different types of
providers. So the greater risks that you anticipate, the more
screening you will have to do, which may require some onsite
visits for things like DME companies, to ensure that these are
actually valid companies that are actually in business.
But I think one of the steps looking to the future is that
a lot of this information that is coming out of their automated
screening process that CMS is doing has to also be incorporated
into their Fraud Prevention System.
In other words, connecting the dots, not--as you screen
providers, to make the network connections between different
types of providers. Because what you have is are often put up
as fronts for different companies. And as you establish who
these folks are, you'll see that there are connections with
other folks that are actually committing fraud.
So I think a big piece of that is doing the screening, but
then incorporating what you are finding out from that screening
and what you are also doing with respect to claims analysis and
predictive analytics.
Mr. Engel. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentleman and now
recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey, 5 minutes
for questions.
Mr. Gingrey. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
And I want to thank all of the panelists, all of the
witnesses. I am going to direct my questions primarily to the
member from the Government Accountability Office, Kathy King.
So, Ms. King, it will be primarily directed toward you.
I will kind of follow up on what my colleague from New
York, Mr. Engel, was just referencing regarding the provisions
in the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act, Obamacare,
toward combating waste, fraud, and abuse. And I think he gave
the figure of an estimated savings of $7 billion over 10 years
if these provisions of Obamacare were implemented.
Ms. Lavelle testified that WellPoint's anti-fraud
activities rely in part on a system of identifying high-risk
practices, providers, and beneficiaries, and then creating
solutions such as prior review to deal with these problems.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act created a
number of--in fact, I think at least eight anti-fraud
provisions, such as granting the Secretary the authority to
conduct criminal background checks for providers and suppliers
considered high risk.
Ms. King, you referenced that.
Can you tell me whether this administration has, to date,
implemented all of these provisions that are in the law in
Obamacare?
Ms. King. I cannot, because our process of checking on them
is not complete. But, you know, in the spring when we also
testified about this issue, there were a few provisions,
including the criminal background check and surety bond
provisions, that were not yet implemented.
Mr. Gingrey. Let me help you a little bit. You say you
cannot answer the question on what has been implemented.
Section 6407 of Obamacare created a requirement that CMS
implement face-to-face encounters between patients and
providers before a physician can certify eligibility for
durable medical equipment.
While the State of Georgia has many good and hopefully
honest and mostly honest DME providers, we all know that
durable medical equipment is one of the most fraudulent areas
in Medicare and has garnered nationwide scrutiny on programs
even like ``60 Minutes.''
Can you tell me, has the administration implemented face-
to-face provider meetings for DME to date? Have we done that?
Ms. King. Not to my knowledge, they have not. Ordinarily,
if I were appearing before a committee, I would check on all of
those things, but I did not have the opportunity to fully check
all those things before coming today.
Mr. Gingrey. Well, look, I am going to help you again. And
I said there were eight things I think you--maybe CMS has
implemented one of the eight. But let me list, just read to you
a number that have it, including this face-to-face encounter in
regard to prescribing durable medical equipment.
Implement checks to make sure that a physician actually
referred a Medicare beneficiary for medical service--for
example, clinical laboratory--before paying the claim.
No, they have not done that.
Implement a surety bond on home health agencies and certain
other providers of services and supplies.
No, they have not done that.
Establish a compliance program for fee-for-service
providers and suppliers.
Once again, no, that has not been done.
Implement a temporary moratorium for new Medicare providers
from enrolling and billing the Medicare program even though
there are more than enough suppliers to furnish healthcare
services in certain areas of the country.
No, they have not done that.
Mr. Chairman, I believe this committee should find out what
powers CMS has. Many of them, as Ms. King indicated, and
others, that were granted in the law which is now over 2 years
old to help implement waste, fraud, and abuse that it currently
does not employ. So how are we going to save that $7 billion
over the next 10 years.
My opposition to Obamacare in this committee certainly is
well known. I do believe that protecting taxpayer dollars and
Medicare dollars from fraud and abuse is one of the main
charges of this government and that we as committee members
have.
And it is very much a bipartisan issue. Medicare is set to
go bankrupt as early as 2017, as late as 2024. If this
administration has the authority to implement changes within
the Medicare program that could prevent billions in lost funds
annually and it is not using them, I believe, Mr. Chairman,
that the administration owes us an accounting of the reasons
why to date, 2 years, seven out of eight provisions have not
been implemented.
And I yield back.
Mr. Pattinson. Mr. Chairman, Congressman, I would like to
make a comment.
Mr. Pitts. Go ahead. You may.
Mr. Pattinson. I think you are describing a very
significant problem about the DME issue of being able to
deliver equipment and have it prescribed without physical
contact.
Looking at the pilot that we once proposed under this
Medicare CAC Act, I would suggest that that is exactly a very
good reason why we could use the twin card approach; a provider
and a patient must both combine their cards in a reader to
perform the transaction to show that they have authorized this
particular DME equipment for this provider, by this provider
for this individual. Then subsequently on delivery. Then we
know who was responsible for issuing that request.
So no nefarious claims or no nefarious deliveries of DME
equipment can now take part on the basis that you have to have
two keys to make that request work. So I would strongly
recommend that we include that as part of the pilot.
Mr. Pitts. All right. Thank you.
The Chair now recognize the gentleman from Illinois, Mr.
Shimkus, for 5 minutes for questions.
Mr. Shimkus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Apologize for not being here for all the opening
statements. Thanks for your testimony. In this era of budget
crises and entitlement reform, to think that we wouldn't do
some simple steps to get a handle on waste, fraud, and abuse is
unbelievable. Frustrating from those of us.
Mr. Pattison, just for a second, and you mentioned it
earlier in one of the questions, H.R. 2925, which I am a co-
sponsor of, bipartisan support, is what type of a program?
What is the intent of 2925?
Mr. Pattinson. It is to operate a pilot----
Mr. Shimkus. A pilot program.
Mr. Pattinson. Pilot program of five regions.
Mr. Shimkus. How are the region to be chosen?
Mr. Pattinson. The regions would be defined the by agency
implementing the----
Mr. Shimkus. And it is my understanding under the highly
abused areas of----
Mr. Pattinson. If that's what they so choose, that would be
where they would have the best effect.
Mr. Shimkus. That is the intent.
Mr. Pattinson. Indeed.
Mr. Shimkus. I think that is our intent.
Mr. Pattinson. The pilot would be to upgrade the Medicare
cards for the beneficiaries by taking the number off the card
and providing the card, such as the one I have in my hand here.
It would also be providing a similar smart card, but with more
capability to the provider. Then by using the terminals at the
various locations, which, by the way, with a Chip and PIN
implementation coming out, these terminals are going to become
prevalent all over the place, anyway. So we are just adding
basically functionality to existing terminals that will exist
by the time we get around to a pilot.
But by putting the two cards in the same unit, performing
the PIN actions of the beneficiary and the fingerprint of the
provider, we conceal those transactions and prevent people from
creating transactions without any of these technologies.
So think of it like a safety deposit box in the bank; you
need to have two keys to make this drawer open. You need to
have these two keys to make these transactions work.
So the pilot is to test this. And to date Dr. Fu's
testimony, it is to make sure we design the very best and most
robust system for a potential rollout.
Mr. Shimkus. And, Mr. Terzich, do you want to add to this
discussion on the use of the card?
Mr. Terzich. Mr. Congressman, I would add the following.
Essentially, when you look at, both from the government and
from the private sector perspective, the pervasive deployment
expansion of smart cards and smart chips, you know, today there
are literally billions of smart chips in circulation, millions
of smart cards in circulation. And despite some random rogue
instances of security breach, the underlying technology has
demonstrated time and time again that it is a very productive,
useful technology.
And when you apply that to the challenge at hand here where
there is a very optimal opportunity to engage in the low-
hanging fruit by simply deploying some technology, that I think
would in many respects take a big slice out of the abuse and
the fraud that exist today.
Mr. Shimkus. I have no understanding why we would not move
immediately to do this as a start. Not the entire solution of
waste, fraud, and abuse in the system. But this is really a no-
brainer. Twenty million Department of Defense individuals use
this system. This is not--this is not new technology or new
activity that no one has used before.
So the other thing I would like to add on is, Mr.
Pattinson, how about international--well, let me start by this
too, because my frustration is pretty high on our challenges
that we face in this country.
If anyone uses their credit card overseas today, theft
comes by someone stealing your slip, not through the
technology.
If anyone uses a passport, these new passports that we have
that swipe through the system, they are using this with
biometric facial identification. I mean, folks, we are using
this now. All we are asking is that let's try it to highlight
waste, fraud, and abuse.
I want to move to Ms. Lavelle real quick.
Your testimony is also illustrative of an issue with the
healthcare law, fee for service, and Medicare Advantage. And I
would hope that when you go back, you would ask to do an
analysis of the waste, fraud, and abuse under fee for service
versus waste fraud and abuse in dollars. You have to get some
statistician that would make it equal sizes or whatever they
have to do to make sure.
But I would wager money that fee for service is multiple
times more abusive in waste, fraud, and abuse. And the argument
I would postulate is that you have an organization established
and folks making sure that there is not waste, fraud, and abuse
going out the door, and that is that whole medical loss ratio
debate and what is going to be able to be paid for.
So if we don't allow companies to do their due diligence
because we don't let them qualify in the medical loss ratio,
guess what, we are going to have more waste, fraud, and abuse.
It is the most ludicrous thing that I have seen. We need
market, we need competition. The private sector does that
because they don't want to lose the money.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I think we need to have many more
hearings on this issue.
Thank you all.
Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentleman and now
recognizes the gentlelady from Tennessee, Ms. Blackburn, for 5
minutes for questions.
Ms. Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I want to thank each of you for your patience, sitting
through this hearing, being here with us today.
Ms. King, thank you for your report. I appreciate that you
got that in to us in a timely manner, and I appreciate the way
that you broke it out, looking at medical facilities, durable
goods, and where the problem exists.
I think for those of us that have been focusing on this
waste, fraud, abuse issue in the Medicare/Medicaid systems, and
this is not a new problem, what we have come to realize is that
HHS as a whole doesn't put enough attention on this issue, and
that we still have a broken system, and that the pay and chase
model does not yield the results that we need.
And I can tell by looking at your nodding heads you all
agree with that.
I will say this. I am disappointed that we did not get the
Medicare report that was due to be made public on October 1
looking at these issues. And my hope is that we are going to
see this soon.
I do want to ask you, Ms. King, did you all look at the
contract that was given to Northrop Grumman in 2011 to develop
a system? We had the bureaucrats there at Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid at CMS that gave a $77 million contract to have
Northrop Grumman in 2011 to come up with a fraud prevention
system. Did you all look at this contract and the miserable
yield that has come from that with its first eight months of
implementation?
Ms. King. We evaluated the implementation of the program.
But we did not look specifically at the contract.
Ms. Blackburn. OK. But I think you can say if we spent $77
million in 8 months into the implementation, we have seen a
$7,591 return from that investment, that it is pretty poor,
pretty poor investment.
I want to turn to Mr. Saccoccio, Mr. Terzich, and ask you
all, if you were given a $77 million contract, how would you go
about--what would your advice to Medicare, to CMS be on solving
this problem? Would you have a ready answer? Would you have a
way to move forward to help CMS, to help companies like
WellPoint in identifying this fraud before it is committed?
Mr. Saccoccio. You know, the CMS contract and their
implementation of this Fraud Prevention System, from our
viewpoint, it is definitely a road they have to go down. Now,
whether or not, you know, the cost of that contract and who
they decided to go with, with respect to that contract, I have
no particular information on that. But definitely predictive
analytics and predictive modeling, those are the things that
they have to be doing going down the road.
Now, sometimes I think what happens with these systems is
that, with respect to suspension of payments, I know they
haven't started where they are actually suspending payments
based on the----
Ms. Blackburn. Well, in the interest of time, let me
interrupt you now.
Do you know private sector companies that could probably
solve this and solve this problem quickly?
Mr. Saccoccio. It is hard to say. I know some of the health
plans are using predictive modeling of some sort. About 40
percent of our members do. And as Ms. Lavelle mentioned, they
are having success with that.
So I think, you know, obviously, the implementation, there
are more efficient ways of doing things. But not being part of
that process, it is very hard for me to say.
Mr. Terzich. Congresswoman, can I add a comment here?
Ms. Blackburn. Yes, you may.
Mr. Terzich. You know, when you have look at the challenge
that we face, I think it is the sum of a variety of technology-
based solutions that can make a big impact.
And beyond predictive analytics, you know, you have the
opportunity in H.R. 2925 to add the electronic handshake that
occurs. And that information that gets processed in real time,
in combination with predictive analytics, is going to increase
visibility throughout the process.
And from our private commercial experience in business,
what you see is the more visibility you apply to the process
through the use of technology, the more opportunity you have to
refine those processes over time. And so it is much more of a
journey than an event. But it creates a tremendous opportunity.
Ms. Blackburn. So what you are saying basically is, with
the existing technologies and with the existing platforms that
you all have created in the private sector, we could create a
pathway that would place the necessary firewalls and the
necessary handshakes and the necessary screenings and
prequalifications that would eliminate much of the fraud, which
has now become big business in Medicare/Medicaid, so big that
we have even had the Secretary of HHS before us say they don't
know exactly how big it is, if it is a $4 billion a year or $10
billion or $100 billion.
The issue is, we have to find a way to track it and
eliminate it and prevent it from occurring because pay and
chase doesn't work. So what you are saying is you all have the
items that are necessary.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentlelady.
I ask unanimous consent that Congresswoman Christensen and
Congressman McKinley be allowed to address our witnesses for 5
minutes.
Without objection, so ordered.
Dr. Christensen, you are recognized for 5 minutes for
questions.
Mrs. Christensen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, again,
thank you and thank the ranking member for allowing me to sit
in on this hearing.
And thank the panelists for being here.
Mr. Saccoccio, one of the points you raised in your
testimony is that information-sharing--and others did, too--and
cooperation among all players of health care is critical. And
you spoke about collaboration between HHS, I guess, and DOJ.
But could you talk a little about the current information-
sharing that might be taking place between private and public
sector and what more could be done? And any specific examples
you might have of how that public-private partnership and
sharing of information has led to some success in cracking down
on fraud?
Mr. Saccoccio. Yes, as I mentioned in my testimony,
information-sharing is critical between the public and private
sides. You have a healthcare system where you have multiple,
multiple payers. None of them get a complete view of everything
that is happening out there. Therefore, it is incredibly
important that they share information.
Some of the things that are happening right now, my
organization, NHCAA, our members consist of health plans, about
90 health insurers, but we also partner with the public side,
as well. So the CMS, the IG's office at HHS, the FBI, they all
participate with us. And the things that we do, we actually
have meetings where everyone sits around a table and talks
about what they are seeing, what the emerging schemes are, what
the emerging trends are, so that you could take that
information back and look at your own data and your own plan.
So that is happening.
We have a database of investigations so that if a private
insurer, say, WellPoint, opens an investigation and puts that
information into the database, that information is available
not only to other health plans but also to law enforcement,
FBI. So that kind of information is being shared.
We also have a process by which if there is an open
investigation that, say, the FBI is conducting and they want to
know whether there was any private exposure on the private side
for private health plans, they can query us, and we go out to
the private side members to see what kind of exposure there may
be.
So those types of things are happening.
What I see with this Health Care Fraud Prevention
Partnership, I think that allows us to potentially take it to
the next level, where you could actually have data exchanges,
data analysis done, where private health plans could take a
look at their data, the government could take a look at their
data, say, in Medicare fee for service and Medicaid, and on
particular topics come together and share that data to see what
each payer is seeing so that you can anticipate that.
A good example of this was, back in 2010, we had an
information-sharing meeting at NHCAA that we hosted in Florida,
where we had the FBI, the inspector general's office at HHS,
local law enforcement, private payers, all came together to
discussion the infusion therapy fraud in south Florida. And
based on that, the private insurers found out that they had
about a half a billion dollars of exposure from infusion
therapy fraud just based on the information that they were able
to obtain from CMS and vice versa.
So it is incredibly important in the environment that we
have that, as information comes out from the various data
analytics that different companies use and that CMS may be
using, that as they see different things, that they share those
with the other payers so that they can go back and see what
kind of exposure they may have.
Mrs. Christensen. Thank you.
Dr. Fu, we had at least two testimonies about smart cards,
and we can see that they would provide protection. But one of
the problems that was noticed in a National Health Law Program
fact sheet was that they can also be a barrier to access and
perhaps, this article suggested, that identity verification
programs reduce costs by discouraging eligible beneficiaries
from obtaining the cards and, therefore, the benefits, rather
than from preventing fraud.
So my question to you is, do you think in these pilot
programs this is another factor that should be included in
assessing----
Mr. Fu. I do think a pilot program should look at both--or
not only the benefits, but also the risks, including the
clinical care and potential patients who may not receive the
care they would have otherwise had.
Mrs. Christensen. Thank you. And----
Mr. Pattinson. If I could comment, the fact that they have
the card or not today, in terms of their care, it shouldn't
detract in any way or make it any different to what we would
have if we did a smart card implementation. The patient should
always be getting their care and not have any negative effect.
So I don't see any difference between what we do today as
well as what we could do with a smart card. You are not going
to get denied service. We are just trying here to stop the
fraud.
Mrs. Christensen. It is just the hurdles that they have to
go through to get the card. And for a person that might be
disabled, poor, poorly educated, there are barriers there for
them to really access the card and, therefore, the benefits.
Mr. Pattinson. I am sure you have a good point,
Congresswoman. The fact that the ATM cards and everything, they
are using bank cards today, debit cards, credit cards--this is
nothing more than a card and a PIN. And, yes, there will be
instances where PINs are hard for those to manage, and in that
case we need to have the right policy and the right part of the
pilot to work out how to correct those situations.
Mrs. Christensen. That was the point of my question, that
it should be a part of the pilot so that we could make sure
that, while they provide the security, they don't increase the
barriers. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentlelady.
That concludes round one. We will go to one follow-up per
side.
Dr. Burgess, you are recognized for 5 minutes for a follow-
up.
Mr. Burgess. I thank the chairman for the recognition.
Ms. King, let me just ask you. You guys have done some
extensive study on the fraud prevention system at CMS, and you
have prepared a report. Can you give us an idea of what is the
number of fraudulent claims that have been stopped dead in
their tracks by this fraud-prevention system?
Ms. King. Not exactly. I can't, sir. But, you know----
Mr. Burgess. Well, let me ask you this: Has there been one
instance where a claimed dollar didn't go out the door because
of this fraud-prevention system?
Ms. King. I don't believe that they are stopping payments
yet.
And I think the way the system was designed, it was not
intended to be an automatic stopping of payments in most cases.
The way it is designed is that it flags problematic claims and
problematic payments so that then those things are investigated
to determine whether they appear to be fraudulent.
Mr. Burgess. Your answer is not giving me--I mean, I talked
about the Elysian Fields and the problems that are ahead. You
are not giving me a great deal of confidence that the dollars
aren't going to fly out the door at an even faster rate and end
up in places where they shouldn't be.
Now, one of the things I have talked about before and I
mentioned in my opening statement, do you think there are a
sufficient number of Federal prosecutors to be able to bring
the prosecutorial case for fraud when it is discovered?
Ms. King. We are currently in the process of evaluating the
use of the healthcare control account which provides funds to
DOJ, the FBI, and the OIG. So we will be in a better position
to evaluate that later this year.
Mr. Burgess. And once again, you are not giving me a great
deal of confidence here.
You know, when I send one of my staff members with my
personal credit card down to Chick-fil-A to buy lunch for the
office, I get a call back that says, Hey, your card is being
used to charge $100 worth of Chick-fil-A here; is that OK with
you? Why can't it work that way in the CMS world?
Ms. King. You mean that there is an automatic response?
Mr. Burgess. Yes. When something appears out of the
ordinary. ``This isn't something that we normally see in the
conduct of your business day, Doctor. Here is some evidence
that may be of interest to you.'' And I say, ``No, no, it is
fine. You let them go ahead and have the Chick-fil-A.'' But why
is it so hard in your world, or CMS's world I should say, for
that to happen?
Ms. King. I don't know the exact magnitude of the cost, but
I think implementing something like that--and I have gotten
phone calls, too, from the grocery store before I have gotten
home, ``Did you charge this?'' I think that technology is
expensive.
Mr. Burgess. Apparently it is worthwhile for Visa. Because
what is their fraud rate? .03 percent? And CMS's fraud rate is
anybody's guess, but 10 percent or whatever it is?
Ms. King. You know, we have not been able to determine what
the fraud rate is in----
Mr. Burgess. I get you.
Ms. King [continuing]. Government or private health plans.
Mr. Burgess. But I would suspect that WellPoint is not in
the business of letting all of their dollars go out the door
inappropriately.
Is that correct, Ms. Lavelle?
Ms. Lavelle. Yes, that is correct.
We have two prepayment review programs going, one in New
York, one out of Chicago. Just last year alone, in placing some
of these providers on prepay review where we turn off their
ability to file electronically, they send in medical records,
we have saved $18 million, just in the New York market. So that
is one of our most aggressive and useful tools right now.
Mr. Burgess. Yes. As a provider, I would hate that. But at
the same time, when you are dealing with the problem, the
magnitude that we are seeing, and you are fixing to expand it--
you know, let's be honest. The Affordable Care Act, the States
that aren't going to do a State exchange, that are going to do
the Federal fallback, I mean, this creates an entire new
dimension for fraud, which brings up the other point.
How at WellPoint are you staying ahead--you know, some of
the stuff we heard on Homeland Security, you have to learn to
think like a terrorist. How are you learning to think like a
criminal who wants to defraud the healthcare system?
Ms. Lavelle. Well, we try to stay ahead with the emerging
technologies. We are looking at devices, pharmaceuticals,
procedures. Every week there is something new that comes out.
The providers have consultants which tell them how to bill
for these things. Even though they are investigational and not
covered, they get counsel on how to bill for them under
conventional coding. So we are constantly looking at those
devices and trying to stop a lot of them on the dime.
The providers actually advertise the new devices on their
Web site and tout that they are covered by most insurers. And
we have shut several of them down in the last few years.
Mr. Burgess. But to reemphasize the point, those dollars
spent on that activity would be scored as administrative
dollars----
Ms. Lavelle. Exactly.
Mr. Burgess [continuing]. Under the medical loss ratio. In
fact, you are not going to be rewarded for doing that in the
new system under the Affordable Care Act. You will be penalized
to some degree for your fraud-prevention activities.
So in an odd way the Affordable Care Act is creating new
opportunities for fraud and penalizing you if you decide that
you are not going to pay these dollars out inappropriately. It
is a recipe for fiscal disaster.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will yield back my time.
Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentleman and now
recognizes the ranking member, Mr. Pallone, for 5 minutes for
follow-up questions.
Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I had one question, but I wanted to clarify the record.
When Dr. Gingrey mentioned that CMS had not implemented the
face-to-face requirement from the Affordable Care Act, that is
not correct. The face-to-face requirement for durable medical
equipment was implemented in this year's physician fee schedule
rule, and home health face-to-face requirements were
implemented in 2011.
The other thing, I wanted to respond to Ms. Lavelle's
testimony and Mr. Shimkus's stating that the medical loss ratio
formula undermines fraud-fighting activities by insurers. In
fact, the medical loss ratio requirement in the ACA is a
critical consumer protection that has already saved consumers
over a billion dollars. HHS followed the NAIC position on how
to characterize the fraud-fighting activities and provided some
room for insurers in the formula.
And fraud-fighting is an administrative activity, and I
don't think it should become an open-ended loophole to
undermine the medical loss ratio. The formula fairly allows
some moneys to be deducted from the administrative side of the
formula but balances that against undermining this important
consumer protection, in my opinion.
I wanted to ask Dr. Fu, I have this article that discusses
students at Cambridge University in England, and it finds--
basically what they did is they crashed the chip and PIN
system. Have you seen this before?
Mr. Fu. I am not familiar with that particular article, but
I am familiar with the work.
Mr. Pallone. Yes. So, I mean, if this is happening with the
secure card now, isn't there a danger of that in Medicare? I
mean, how do we--you know, I know it is Cambridge and they are
smart, but isn't there the same risk?
Mr. Fu. Well, I think these--you cannot underplay the
risks. There will inevitably be problems in any technology. But
one thing for sure, it is not a silver bullet. And, in
particular, there can be some vulnerabilities in the software
associated with interfacing with readers.
Mr. Pallone. And, Mr. Pattinson, since I brought this up, I
should give you an opportunity to comment on that, too, if you
want. I noticed the British accent, so maybe you are familiar
with Cambridge and what is going on there.
Mr. Pattinson. Well, I am an American citizen, Congressman,
but, yes, that is my roots.
I would say that in all these instances that you find it is
not the card technology that has been compromised, it is the
system that it has been involved in. And with the good offices
of good security professionals like Dr. Fu, we often engage
these people at Cambridge ourselves and hire them to actually
try and attack our systems. And on that basis we can make
better improvements for the future rollouts.
So for any Medicare pilot and potential rollout, we would
ensure that we have all of the lessons learned from these other
situations where the systems have become and are identified as
vulnerable and make sure that we implement the technology which
is the best for this Medicare program and, therefore, the best
for sustaining the longevity of this benefit program.
Mr. Pallone. All right. Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
That concludes the testimony. If Members have questions for
the witnesses, I ask that the witnesses respond to the
questions promptly. I remind Members that they have 10 business
days to submit questions for the record. Members should submit
their questions by the close of business on Wednesday, December
the 12th.
Mr. Pitts. Excellent hearing. Thank you very much for your
testimony.
Without objection, the subcommittee is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:12 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
