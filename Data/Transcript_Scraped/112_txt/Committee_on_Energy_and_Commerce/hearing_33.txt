OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH R. PITTS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA

Mr. Pitts. Subcommittee will come to order. Chair
recognizes himself for 5 minutes for an opening statement. An
article in Health Affairs in September 2010 titled ``National
Costs of the Medical Liabilities System'' estimated that the
medical liability cost including defensive medicine were $55.6
billion in 2008 dollars, or 2.4 percent of total health care
spending. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, total
payments on medical malpractice claims in 2009 totaled
$3,471,631,100. The average claims payment for 2009 was
$323,273.
Let me share with you what this means to my home State of
Pennsylvania. According to Kaiser again, Pennsylvania ranks
second behind New York in the total dollars paid out in
malpractice claims at $295,459,500 and the average claims
payment in Pennsylvania was higher than the national average.
Pennsylvania also paid more malpractice claims than any State
except New York, California, and Florida with 767 paid claims
in 2009. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health,
nearly 20 percent of the physicians who practice primary care
say they will leave Pennsylvania in 5 years or less, and only
one in three physicians who complete their medical degree in
Pennsylvania plan to remain in the State to practice. Over the
years, numerous physicians have called my office to tell me how
the medical liability climate in Pennsylvania has affected
their practices. Usually these are OB-GYNs, but sometimes
doctors from other specialties call. Up until a few years ago
they would tell me and my staff that while they had planned to
practice for 5, 6, or even more years they were retiring early
because they just couldn't afford their malpractice insurance
premiums. Or, they would say they were forced to move their
practices to nearby Delaware State to remain financially
viable. Recently doctors have begun to tell me they are moving
to North Carolina to set up practice.
Apparently other States have a much less onerous medical
malpractice climate and Pennsylvania's loss is their gain. My
home State consistently ranks as having one of the worst
medical liability climates in the Nation. The high legal costs
paid by Pennsylvania healthcare providers increase overall
healthcare costs, limit access to medical care, and inhibit job
growth. We all agree that patients who are injured by medical
mistakes should be promptly and fairly compensated. However,
capping non-economic medical malpractice awards does not deny
patients their day in court or fair compensation. It merely
reigns in over the top verdicts and allows conscientious
doctors to afford insurance coverage and serve their patients.
The current medical liability system does not work for
anyone especially patients who need access to quality
healthcare. Like it or not, patients are inescapably
intertwined in this malpractice mess where some receive
unlimited court awards and the rest of us are left with limited
healthcare and higher cost. We need to find a balance where
conscientious doctors can afford insurance coverage and
patients can get quality care when and where they need it.
I now yield the rest of my time to Dr. Gingrey.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PHIL GINGREY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA

Mr. Gingrey. Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for yielding
to me on such an important issue. And as we know this country
is on the verge of a medical liability crisis.
Focusing on just my specialty, Obstetrics and Gynecology,
each OB-GYN will be sued three times in their careers. Think
about 25 to 30 years of practice. Even though 50 percent of
these cases are eventually dropped, dismissed, or settled
without a payment for the plaintiff, 30 percent of OB-GYN
fellows report increasing cesarean deliveries over traditional
birth, but the rate in this country is probably now 29 percent.
Twenty-six percent have stopped performing or offering
traditional births altogether over this fear of being sued and
ending their career. But why is this significant?
As I say, the cesarean sections can cost our health system
twice as much if not three times as much as routine vaginal
birth and that is just one example of what is referred to as
defensive medicine. It is a glaring example, however. The order
of tests or procedures simply to protect a medical provider
from a lawsuit is really mounting. You can't get--go to
emergency room with a headache without coming out with a bill
for a CT scan or an MRI.
Studies, most notably one that was done by Pricewaterhouse
Coopers, show that this defensive practice that doctors are
engaging in across all specialties quite frankly resulted in
about $210 billion in additional healthcare costs in 2008 and
today these costs are certainly much higher because of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. I have realized my
time is running pretty short here and I know I am going to have
to yield back, but I want to thank the chairman for yielding
time. Maybe I can get someone else to yield me a little bit
more time so I can finish my full statement, but it will go in
the record and this is hugely important. I am so grateful for
the witnesses and I look forward to your testimony. And I yield
back, Mr. Chair. Thank you for the time.
Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The Chair
recognizes the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mrs. Capps,
for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LOIS CAPPS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

Mrs. Capps. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before we begin this
hearing I would like to say that this is a bill we have heard
before; a bill on which we have disagreed before. While the
goal is clear, meaningful tort reforms that protect patients
and medical professional and reduce healthcare costs it is also
clear that differences in our approach remain. We certainly
should be looking at ways to bring down the cost of medical
malpractice insurance, but the bill before us today only limits
the amount of money that patients who have been wrongfully
harmed can collect to compensate them for their injuries. It
does nothing to solve the root of that problem, reducing the
incidents of malpractice.
I believe we should be focused on improving patient care
and reducing the astounding number of costly, preventable,
medical errors that claim 98,000 lives every year. Reducing
medical errors would not only save lives, it would save a lot
of money. And as the number of studies have shown, focusing on
improving patient care and reducing error has led to dramatic
drops in medical malpractice payment. These medical--these
studies are instructive on how to reduce the actual not-
hypothetical cost of malpractice.
Another area where I think we should set the record
straight is the notion that excessive or frivolous lawsuits are
because of rising premiums. The problem is that the lawsuits
affected by the bill are by definition not frivolous. Where
large damages are awarded the jury has found that the patient
has been severely harmed. And in fact, over the last 5 years
malpractice insurance payments to patients have actually gone
down all while premiums have continued to go up which raises
the question of what is the real driving force for these
expenses. There is also no evidence that capping the damages an
injured person receives because of malpractice is the most
effective way to solve this problem. It will not lower
premiums. It will not even stabilize them. Instead, this
proposal will penalize innocent victims of medical neglect--
negligence.
Furthermore, H.R. 5 goes far beyond protections between
patients and doctors. In fact, what is concerning is the extent
to which this bill would protect drug companies and HMOs from
lawsuits in cases where they have clearly hurt people. This
expands the issue far beyond what many feel is the proper scope
of this type of policy.
Lastly, we disagree about the extent of what the Federal
Government's role in tort reform should be. At our Governors'
hearing a few weeks ago, we repeatedly heard these Governors
stress that the needs of their States were different from one
another and that to meet the needs of their states they needed
flexibility. I find it ironic that this majority who for so
long has been champions of State government, State and local
control are supporting a bill that would impose a Federal one-
size-fits-all solution with no flexibility in an area that has
been traditionally a matter of State law. I believe there can
be State solutions to this problem and I am interested in
seeing how the provisions of the Affordable Care Act can help
solve them. The healthcare law authorizes $50 million over 5
years in grants to States to explore new approaches to settling
losses including health court and disclose and offer models.
This commitment to State solutions is also echoed in the
President's budget which this year proposes $250 million in
grants for States to rewrite their own malpractice laws in ways
that seek to balance the interest of both doctors and patients.
I look forward to seeing the innovative State solutions that
these grants will spur. Despite the good intentions for this
bill, H.R. 5 does not help patients. It does not help the
medical profession move toward lowering healthcare costs in a
really meaningful way. Instead, it just shifts the costs of
malpractice from the party at fault to injured individuals,
their families, and taxpayers through publicly funded programs
such as Medicare, Medicaid, and disability benefits. And I
yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks the gentlelady and now recognizes
the chairman emeritus of the full committee, Mr. Barton, for 5
minutes.
Mr. Barton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am going to
yield some of that time to Dr. Burgess and also to Dr. Gingrey.
Thank you for holding this hearing. As we have seen in my
home State of Texas, medical malpractice reform can work. In
Texas they have had cost savings of over $879 million. They
have also added 21,640 positions since they did reform back in
2003. Of those 21,640 new doctors, over 1,200 have come from
the great State of New York. In 2003, New York and Texas had
basically the same medical malpractice premiums. Since Texas
implemented its reform package, Texas's premiums have decreased
by 28 percent while New York State's--excuse me, have increased
by over 60 percent. The result is obvious. Doctors are coming
to Texas. They are leaving New York. This is going to be a good
hearing, and we look forward to our testimony from our
witnesses. And at this point in time I would like to yield 3
minutes to Dr. Burgess.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS, A REPRESENTATIVE
IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS

Mr. Burgess. And I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr.
Chairman, this is an important hearing. First want to welcome
Dr. Lisa Hollier who is an OB-GYN like me from Texas, that is--
and she is going to share with us some of the good news that
has come from on the ground, in the State of Texas since 2003
when Texas enacted its own liability reform--truly a 21st
century solution to a problem that has been with us for a long
time.
Now, the President in his State of the Union Address said
that medical malpractice reform is needed to reign in frivolous
lawsuits. Mr. President, I could not agree more. In fact, the
very next morning I penned a letter in my own hand as you can
see to the President saying ``I want to work with you on
this.'' He asked for ideas from on both sides of the aisle. I
sent the letter down to the White House. I will ask unanimous
consent to insert this as part of the record and Mr. President,
I am still waiting on a response and I was serious about this
offer. As you can see from this hearing, many of us are serious
about this today.
I am so painfully aware that many doctors are forced to
practice defensive medicine, or retire, or run for Congress in
the face of constant threat of non-meritorious lawsuits and
unsustainable medical liability insurance. I do not believe we
need to study this anymore. In Texas, we know what works.
Liability reform served as a catalyst to bring doctors to
underserved regions of the State including those that had no
access to a physician in the past.
Texas is one of the largest States in the Union, has a
diverse population, diverse economy and geography, yet our
reforms have proven successfully tailored to adapt and produce
across-the-State results. Eighty-two Texas counties have seen a
net gain in emergency room doctors including 26 counties who
had none. The Texas State Board of Medical Examiners in 2001
licensed 2,088 new doctors, the fewest in a decade. Today, they
are challenged to keep up with the physicians who now want to
practice in our State. In 2008, over 3,600 new doctors--the
highest number ever recorded. In my field of obstetrics, Texas
saw a net loss of 14 obstetricians in the 2 years prior to
reform. Since then the State has experience a net gain of 192
obstetricians and over 25 rural counties that never had one now
do.
Texas has enjoyed a 62 percent greater growth in newly
licensed physicians in the past 3 years compared to the 3 years
preceding liability reform Texas has benefitted. I am happy to
share this success that we are experiencing so that all States
can reap the benefit. I have introduced H.R. 896 based on Texas
reforms but there are other ideas from small to bold and we
should be considering them. At this point I will yield the
balance of the time to Dr. Gingrey.
[The information follows:]
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T1612.246

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T1612.247

Mr. Gingrey. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I appreciated the vice
chairman for yielding to me. I was beginning to like the sound
of my voice when I got cut off a few minutes ago.
I was talking about the Provider Shield Act. I want to get
to the more important act, H.R.5, but as Mr. Waxman, the
Committee Ranking Member knows himself there is a growing
concern among the provider and business community that
Obamacare will increase the threat of liability tremendously
and drive many providers out of practice if they follow their
own medical subspecialty guidelines over the treatment edicts
of Secretary Sebelius. And that bill, then H.R. 816 the
Provider Shield Act would protect medical providers from these
edicts and it has gained some bipartisan support.
But even if H.R. 816 becomes law, the crises that $200
billion in costs will inflict on our healthcare system remains
and therefore I have introduces and we will talk about a bi-
partisan bill legislation H.R. 5 the Health Act, along with
Congressman David Scott and Chairman Lamar Smith of the
Judiciary Committee to help bring meaningful medical liability
reform to this country once and for all. If healthcare costs
are truly a national concern then solutions to bring down these
costs are desperately needed. And with that Mr. Chairman, I
will yield back the expired time.
Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks the gentleman. If there is no one
else from the minority wishing to make an opening statement I
will now welcome and introduce our distinguished panel of
witnesses. I would like to thank you for appearing before the
committee this morning. Your willingness to take time out of
your busy schedules underscores just how important this issue
is to all of you as it is to all of us.
Your written testimony will be made a part of the record.
We ask that you take 5 minutes each to summarize your testimony
and at this point I will introduce the witnesses in which order
I ask them to testify.
The first witness is Dr. Lisa Hollier. Dr. Hollier
practices obstetrics and gynecology in Houston, Texas and is a
Professor of OB-GYN and Director of the Lyndon B. Johnson
Residency Program at the University of Texas Medical School at
Houston. She is also a fellow of the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
The next witness is Ms. Joanne Doroshow. Ms. Doroshow is
President and Executive Director, Center for Justice and
Democracy, a public Interest organization in New York City that
is involved in educating the public about issues relating to
civil justice system.
The next witness is Dr. Allen Kachalia. Dr. Kachalia is a
practicing physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital Harvard
Medical School. He is the Medical Director for Quality and
Safety at Brigham and Women's Hospital. He also has a law
degree and conducts research and teaches about legal matters in
medicine including the Medical Professional Liability System.
The next witness is Mr. Brian Wolfman. Mr. Wolfman has been
a practicing lawyer for more than 25 years. He is a Visiting
Professor of Law and Congress-Director, Institute for Public
Representation at Georgetown Law School. He also spent almost
20 years with the Litigation Group of Public Citizen in
Washington, DC.
And the final witness is Dr. Troy Tippett. Dr. Tippett is a
practicing neurosurgeon with more than 35 years of experience.
He is also past President of both the American Association of
Neurological Surgeons and the Florida Medical Associations.
Thank you for coming this morning. Dr. Hollier, you are
recognized for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF LISA M. HOLLIER

Ms. Hollier. Thank you, Chairman Pitts. We applaud you and
the subcommittee for holding this hearing. My name is Dr. Lisa
Hollier and I am an obstetrician/gynecologist from Houston,
Texas speaking on behalf of the American Congress of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), an organization
representing more than 54,000 physicians and partners in
women's health dedicated to improving the healthcare of women.
ACOG ultimately could not support passage of the Health Reform
Bill in large part because it didn't include meaningful
liability reform, an issue we see as critical to reforming our
healthcare system.
We simply cannot build a reformed healthcare system on top
of the broken medical liability system. Without meaningful
reform, the doctors will continue to be driven out of their
home States or out of their practices. When OB-GYNs discontinue
the practice of obstetrics, curtail their surgical services or
close their doors, women's healthcare suffers. For these
reasons, ACOG strongly supports H.R. 5, the Health Efficient
Accessible Low-Cost Timely Healthcare Act introduced by ACOG
fellow representative, Phil Gingrey.
Additionally, we appreciate the support from the 17 Members
of the committee who have cosponsored H.R. 5 including seven on
the health subcommittee. Thank you Representatives John
Shimkus, Mike Rogers, Sue Myrick, Marsha Blackburn, Bob Latta,
Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and Brett Guthrie.
Every day OB-GYNs are faced with exposure to law suits. In
fact, 90 percent of ACOG fellows report that they have been
sued at least once and OB-GYNs are sued an average of 2.7 times
during their careers. Nearly two-thirds of OB-GYNs have changed
their practice during the last 3 years because of the high risk
of liability claims. These changes include increasing the
number of cesarean deliveries, reducing or not offering trial
of labor after cesarean, decreasing the number of high-risk
patients they accept, and even stopping the practice of
obstetrics altogether due to professional liability concerns.
The average age at which physicians cease practicing obstetrics
is now 48, an age once considered the midpoint of an OB-GYN's
career.
Our current tort system fails providers and fails patients.
It is costly, time consuming, inefficient, and unjust with
widely variable and unpredictable monetary judgment. The system
is wholly incompatible with the Institute of Medicine's vision
for the future healthcare system as safe, effective, patient
centered, timely, efficient, and equitable. This is a national
problem which demands a national solution.
That national solution including caps on noneconomic
damages and other reforms like those found in Texas and
California would stabilize the medical liability insurance
market, reduce healthcare cost, eliminate physician flight from
high risk States and protect a patient's access to the
healthcare they need. This is why we fully support H.R. 5, the
Health Act.
H.R. 5 promotes speedy resolution of claims, fairly
allocates responsibility, compensates patient injury, maximizes
patient recovery, puts reasonable limits on the awarded
punitive damages, ensures payment of medical expenses, allows
State flexibility, and saves the Federal Government money. We
know these reforms work. The landscape in my home State of
Texas changed dramatically after implementing medical liability
reform in 2003.
Statewide, 21,640 doctors have been newly licensed in Texas
since its passage. Texas physicians have also seen their
liability insurance premiums cut on average 28.3 percent and
claims and lawsuits in most Texas counties have been cut in
half. Additionally the State has gained 269 obstetricians after
a net loss of 14 obstetricians from 2001 to 2003. Twenty-two
rural counties added at least one obstetrician and 10 counties
added their first obstetrician. Blanco County which had no
obstetrician's pre-reform added eight. In all, 57 Texas
counties have seen a net gain in obstetricians including 28
medically underserved counties and 20 counties designated as
partially medically underserved.
These figures show that a primary result of these reforms
is increased access to care for women across Texas. H.R. 5
holds the promise that increased access to care for even more
women nationwide. We urge this subcommittee and the U.S. House
to give H.R. 5 speedy approval so that we can better serve our
patients. Thank you, Chairman Pitts for your commitment and
your leadership on this issue.

STATEMENT OF JOANNE DOROSHOW

Ms. Doroshow. Thank you, Chairman Pitts and members of the
committee. The Center for Justice and Democracy of which I am
Executive Director is a national public interest organization
dedicated to educating the public about the importance of the
civil justice system. My testimony will focus primarily on
medical malpractice issues since these issues clearly are the
driver for H.R. 5.
I would like to first note that thanks to 30 years of
insurance and medical industry lobbying the medical profession
now has more legal protections for their negligence than any
other profession in the country. As a result the number of
injured patients bringing medical malpractice claims has
reached historic lows. At the same time, premiums have been
stable or dropping since 2006 and have further to drop until
the soft market ends and this is no matter whether a State has
passed tort reform or not.
Despite this, a myth exists of medical malpractice
litigation is a huge driver of our healthcare costs. This is
even though the Congressional Budget Office found that H.R. 5
would result in extremely small healthcare savings, about 0.4
percent. Of this, a trivial amount, 0.3 percent or less is due
to slightly less utilization of healthcare services that is
defensive medicine and 0.2 percent or less is due to reduced
insurance premiums for doctors. As small as these figures are
even they are inflated because CBO ignored factors that would
likely increase the deficit.
In fact, when I met with CBO to discuss these admissions,
they did not deny that liability restrictions lead to more
injuries and deaths and could create new burdens on States and
Federal deficits since the cost of injuries are not eliminated
by enacting tort reform but merely shifted on to some--on
someone else including the government. In fact, one of the
three studies CBO does mention now that there would be a 0.2
percent increase in the Nation's overall death rate by
enactment of H.R. 5. How could this possibly be an acceptable
trade off?
And it is not like we don't have history as a guide here.
In fact, history repeatedly shows for example that capping
damages will not lower insurance rates because what drives
these rate hikes has nothing to do with the State's tort law.
It is driven by the insurance underwriting cycle and investment
income and remedies that do not specifically address this cycle
will fail to stop these wild price gyrations in the future. In
fact, when I returned to New York we will be preparing a major
new campaign to expose the insurance industry's major role in
the pricing of medical malpractice insurance and to hold them
accountable for creating cyclical insurance crises for doctors
in this country. And we hope everyone on this panel joins us in
this.
As for H.R. 5, this bill would establish a permanent
across-the-board $250,000 cap on compensation for noneconomic
damages in medical malpractice cases. Noneconomic damages
compensate for injuries like permanent disability,
disfigurement, blindness, loss of a limb, a damaged
reproductive system, paralysis, or physical pain and suffering.
Such caps are incredibly cruel and unfair.
H.R. 5 would also limit State statute limitations laws, an
idea that lacks complete logic from a deficit reduction
standpoint since its only impact would be to cut off
meritorious claims. It would impose national wage controls on
an injured patient's attorney preventing the patient from
getting decent legal assistance. It would limit punitive
damages even though only 1 percent of medical malpractice
plaintiffs even receive punitive damages. Where is the crisis
demanding that Congress interfere with State law in this area?
It would eliminate joint several liabilities which CBO
itself says could cause a deficit increase not decrease. Dr.
Lora Ellenson, a pathologist at New York Presbyterian Hospital
whose now 13-year-old son Thomas was brain damaged at birth due
to negligence last month told the New York Daily News ``My son
cannot walk or talk. He is not able to carry out activities of
daily living: eating, dressings, toileting, bathing without
constant assistance from an adult. As a physician I have to
come face to face with the knowledge that mistakes are made.
Like most physicians I live with the reality that we might one
day make an error and be sued. When that day comes I will be
grief stricken. Not because of the process, although I am sure
that won't be pleasant, but due the fact that I may have caused
someone irreparable damage. My only hope is that the damaged
person can get what they need to live in the best way they are
able. As a physician I want to know that there will be
compensation to rebuild a life that has been diminished, yet as
a mother I also know that no typical physician nor the system
within which they operate can possibly understand the true
depths of these mistakes.'' I wish Dr. Ellenson's perspective
were more represented by the physicians on this panel today. A
study done in her hospital and other studies around the country
have found that implementing comprehensive patient safety
programs not only decreased severe adverse outcomes, but can
also have an immediate impact on claims and compensation
payments. That should be our focus, not stripping away the
rights of children like Thomas Ellenson. Thank you.

Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks the gentlelady and recognizes Dr.
Kachalia for 5 minutes for your opening statement.

STATEMENT OF ALLEN B. KACHALIA

Mr. Kachalia. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I
thank you for the opportunity to testify today. It is a
privilege to be here. I am here today because I was asked to
speak with regard to the evidence related to the need that we
have for malpractice reform and the measures that are currently
under consideration. It is exciting to see that Congress is
considering malpractice reform especially given the need we
have today to improve our healthcare system comprehensively.
I will quickly cover three main points: 1, what do we know
about malpractice system performance; 2, what reform needs do
we have; and 3, what does the evidence tell us with regard to
the traditional tort reform measures that have been enacted in
the States. I will base my testimony on both my clinical and
research experience that you mentioned earlier.
So first I would like to start by discussing why we need
malpractice reform. We have a malpractice system that
theoretically exists to 1, duly compensate injured patients,
and to 2, reduce substandard care. However, there is general
agreement among many experts that the system is not serving
these functions well. If we turned to frequently cited evidence
with regard to performance of the malpractice system, we can
learn that patients claim compensation in only about 2 percent
of negligent injuries that occur. And even less frequently do
they receive payment.
However, the problem is not just from the patient side.
There is also a problem from the physician perspective. If we
look at claims that have been filed there is concern that too
low number of the claims that are filed actually contain
negligence--approximately one in six. More recently generated
evidence, however, indicates that about 60 percent of filed
claims may actually have an error in them, but still the
malpractice system does not seem to adjudicate these claims
properly with about a quarter of them being improperly
adjudicated. Now, this type of inaccuracy can actually
undermine both patient and physician confidence in our system.
Compounding these problems in data that demonstrates that
the majority of our premium dollars seem to go to fund overhead
costs rather than compensating patients. All of this occurs in
the context of which there are very high insurance premiums for
many physicians and of course we cannot ignore the emotional
costs that can be associated with a law suit whether or not the
suit has merit. There are also unwanted, indirect offenses of
the malpractice system. This includes of course defensive
medicine and the fact of the possibility of litigation that is
always present can undermine the trust that we need in the
patient/physician relationship.
So what these findings show is what they show us what we
need from reform. We need improvements that will actually fix
the liability related shortcomings for both patients and
physicians and a system that will perform these functions much
more efficiently. But our reform targets should probably not
stop there. Reform should also address how well the malpractice
system improves the quality of care that we provide. After all,
this is one of the system's main goals.
So therefore, as Congress considers any reform it becomes
important for Congress to determine what their primary goal is.
Will legislation start in one area alone or will it try to
tackle multiple problems at once and what is the interaction
between making those choices? However, regardless of the
approach that is taken, it remains important to contemplate any
new reforms with the current evidence as to what we know in
mind.
So if I can turn to the evidence here there is a number of
States have enacted tort reform over the years there has been a
growing base on the evidence that we have with regard to the
effect of these reforms. Last year we completed a review of the
evidence on the effect of many traditional tort reforms and
briefly here is what we learned.
For caps on damages, the evidence seems to indicate that
caps can lower the average size of claims payments which
shouldn't be surprising because that is what they are designed
to do and this actually appears to translate into lower
premiums for physicians. There is good evidence to also suggest
that caps made less in defensive practices, however, the effect
of caps on the overall quality of care remains unknown.
For statute of limitations there is reasonable evidence to
show that they may lower premiums but it is unclear what the
statute of limitations do with regard to claims frequency and
they also do not appear to change the average award size. The
evidence on defensive practices and other care related metrics
is limited in this regard.
For attorney fee limits, overall the evidence shows that
fee limits do not seem to translate to lower claims frequency,
cost, or insurance premiums and there is little evidence as to
what happens with regard to care related metrics. So in summary
as we continue to focus on how lower costs and improved quality
in healthcare today, our medical malpractice system is a good
target. Based on data on system performance as we consider how
to reform the system it becomes important to evaluate reforms
not just on liability consequences for patients and providers,
but also to consider the effects on overall cost and quality of
care.
As a practical matter, Congress may offer incremental
reform, but it is important to keep in mind that the ultimate
goal of reform should be reform that addresses all the ails of
our system and that veil consideration of more comprehensive
reforms has also been put out there by Members of Congress. I
would like to emphasize that regardless of the type of reform
that is passed, it is critical to measure its impact and to
have plans that call for proper and timely adjustments based on
what the data tells us. Just as we continue to seek better data
and evidence in medical care, we should ask the same of our
liability system. Thank you.

Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks the gentleman and recognizes Mr.
Wolfman for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN

Mr. Wolfman. Chairman Pitts and members of the committee,
thank you for the opportunity to appear today in opposition to
H.R. 5. I want to focus on what H.R. 5 calls medical product
claims: suits brought by patients claiming that their injuries
were caused by a defective or mislabeled drug or medical
device. I will address three particularly harmful attributes of
H.R. 5: its limits on noneconomic damages, attorney fees, and
punitive damages.
The act would limit noneconomic damages to $250,000. What
does that mean in human terms? My written testimony answers
this question in detail, but today I will focus on one example.
In Wyeth v. Levine, Diana Levine, a musician lost an arm
because of the negligence of a huge drug company Wyeth. She was
awarded $5 million in noneconomic damages. Ms. Levine
experiences phantom pain in her missing arm every day,
sometimes excruciating. She had been a well-known Vermont
musician who loved to play and create music, but her life was
fundamentally altered forever. She is beset by depression, the
mental anguish that frays relationships, and undermines desire
from living a life that will never be fully restored. The idea
that $250,000 can fully compensate for these life altering
injuries is, to be blunt, absurd, and that H.R. 5 fixes
noneconomic damages at $250,000 forever regardless of the
impact of inflation underscores the conclusion that the cap is
not a genuine attempt at gauging the impact on real people's
lives of noneconomic injuries.
Wyeth defended this case with great tenacity. Ms. Levine's
lawyers were required to hire four experts, take wide ranging
discovery, conduct a trial, defend pre and post trial motions,
and defend lengthy multi-year appeals. The financial impact of
Ms. Levine's injuries became so severe that she went into
massive debt during the case and had to take out a large loan
against her judgment. In preparing for this testimony, I asked
Ms. Levine's small-town Vermont lawyer if he would have taken
on Ms. Levine's case had the law limited economic damages to
$250,000. His answer: one word, no.
Studies show that a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages
disproportionally harms women, members of minority groups, and
older people all of whom rely heavily on noneconomic damages to
be made whole. Society should compensate harm and discourage
negligent conduct just as much when it is visited upon a
relatively poor person as when it is visited upon someone who
is economically advantaged.
The act would also limit contingent attorney fees to just
15 percent on recoveries over $600,000. Those figures appear to
be plucked out of the air with no explanation of how they would
correct a supposed distortion in the market for contingent fee
legal services. For someone who does not understand the
economic reality of risk taking in a free enterprise economy,
this provision may appear pro-consumer. After all, limiting the
lawyer's recovery helps the client, right? Wrong.
The free market does not cap contingent fees at 15 percent
because lawyers are not willing to offer that term in a free
market to their clients. The risk and expense of complex
medical products litigation is too great. Ms. Levine audibly
obtained a significant verdict but her lawyer did not know that
result going in. He knew that Wyeth was likely to put on a
formidable defense and take the case all the way to the Supreme
Court. Viewed in hindsight, of course, Ms. Levine would have
done better if a large chunk of her lawyer's fee had been paid
to her. But if the Congress of the United States had demanded
that a small town Vermont lawyer limit his fees to 15 percent,
Ms. Levine never would have been able to find a competent
lawyer to take her case in the first place.
H.R.5 also bars punitive damages in cases where the product
was approved by the FDA. Given the reality of FDA regulation,
that makes no sense. Prescription drugs are FDA approved after
relatively small clinical trials that do not always unearth all
of the product's hazards and side effects. After approval the
product is used by the public at large, a sort of mammoth
clinical experiment and the manufacturer learns more about the
product. In fact, fully half of all drug labeling updates to
warn of serious adverse drug reactions occurs seven or more
years after the drug is approved. Many drug liability suits
concern information that not before the FDA at the time of the
drug's approval. And so it is irrational to immunize the
manufacturer based on that approval particularly where the
manufacturer was grossly negligent in assuring that its product
label remained up to date. But H.R. 5 would do just that.
For this reason as well, H.R. 5 would undermine consumer
health and safety and the committee should reject it. Thank
you.

Mr. Pitts. The Chair thanks the gentleman and recognizes
Dr. Tippett for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF TROY M. TIPPETT

Mr. Tippett. Thank you, Chairman Pitts, and--thank you,
Chairman Pitts and Ranking Member Pallone, for holding this
important hearing to consider this essential business of fixing
our country's broken medical liability system. I am grateful
for the opportunity to appear before this distinguished
committee on behalf of the Health Coalition on Liability and
Access or HCLA to strongly endorse and support passage of H.R.
5, the Health Act of 2011 as it was originally introduced in
January.
HCLA represents a broad, national coalition of physicians,
hospitals, employers, healthcare liability insurers and those
who have joined together to seek some common sense solutions
that will help reduce healthcare costs for all Americans and
insure patient access to quality medical care by enacting
medical liability reform at the Federal level. We believe all
Americans pay the price when the profits of personal injury
lawyers take precedence over patient care.
Today our current medical liability system increases
healthcare costs to unsustainably high medical insurance
premiums and by encouraging the practice of defensive medicine.
It reduces access to care as we see more and more physicians,
particularly younger physicians avoid high risk specialties and
procedures that are the frequent target of lawsuit abuse. Also,
it has become a significant factor in the erosion of the all
important doctor/patient relationship. HCLA believes H.R. 5 is
the kind of comprehensive solution that would bring fairness
and common sense back to our medical liability system. Any
reform legislation should include the following points.
There should be no limit on awards for economic damages. It
should have a reasonable statute of limitations on the medical
malpractice claims. It should have a reasonable limit of
$250,000 on awards for noneconomic damages, and it should have
a replacement of joint and several liability with a fair share
rule. And there should be limits on the contingency fees that
lawyers can charge so that more that that money goes back to
the patient, and it should have a collateral source rule
reform.
Last month, the CBO published two reports that clearly show
enactment of this legislation and similar legislation would
help lower healthcare costs by lowering medical health
insurance liability premiums by reducing the practice of
defensive medicine and by lowering private health insurance
premiums. The CBO estimated that passage of legislation would
save the government $62 billion. Now, I don't know where you
come from, but in my part of the woods that is a significant
amount of money. $62 billion is worth saving. A number of
States have made significant gains in reducing medical lawsuit
in views, but as personal injury lawyers work State by State to
overturn liability reforms and expand areas open to litigation
it is clear that medical liability remains a national problem
that requires a comprehensive Federal solution.
We look forward to working with the committee and others in
Congress to develop the kind of Federal remedy that will bring
consistency and common sense back to the system. There can be
no real healthcare reform without meaningful medical liability
reform. We ask you to please pass H.R. 5.

Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks the gentleman. I would like to
thank the panel for their opening statements and I will now
begin the questioning and recognize myself for 5 minutes for
that purpose.
Dr. Hollier, you have been practicing in Texas for a number
of years. Some of that time was before the State enacted
medical liability reform. Can you tell us how things have
changed for you since medical liability reform in terms of your
ability to provide healthcare to your patients, please?
Ms. Hollier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The reforms in Texas
have truly changed the climate in which we practice medicine. I
work in a medical school and I counsel medical students on a
routine basis. Before the passage of medical liability reforms,
many of my students asked questions and were very concerned
about entering a specialty such as obstetrics because of
professional liability concerns. In the era after our reforms
had passed, those medical students have regained their interest
in our specialty and are excited about the practice of
obstetrics.
We have seen literally hundreds of thousands of extra
patient visits because we have increased access to doctors
across the State of Texas because those doctors are more able
to provide the care that our patients need.
Mr. Pitts. Thank you. Dr. Tippett, in order to help us
understand why a doctor might practice defensive medicine, can
you give us some sense of what it means professionally to be
named a defendant in a malpractice suit? Even in the case
doesn't result in a judgment against you, most neurosurgeons
have been sued. Would you please elaborate?
Mr. Tippett. Yes, thank you very much. Well, in Florida you
can count on the one out of one permanent resident year just
about these days unfortunately, but just--my--when I first
started practicing in Pensacola, Florida, in 1976 I will never
forget it. Within a year of when I started practice, one day I
opened the door and there is a Deputy Sheriff. He is handing me
this subpoena and I am, you know, I am kind of naive. I didn't
know what--I said what in the world is this and I opened it up
and it said you are being sued. And I--you would have thought I
had stuck my hand in electrical current with a hot--with cold
water on my face. I mean it is that shocking.
And the devastation doesn't stop for about 4 years after
that, I can tell you. It doesn't go away. First of all I say,
well, I don't even know who this patient is. Well, it turns out
it was a patient that I had walked in the room that they were
operating on when I was a resident in Memphis, Tennessee,
several years before. I didn't have any idea who the patient
was. Well, they tried to get him to drop me from the trial. Of
course they didn't. I ended up--I had just started my practice
in Pensacola. I had to take time out of my practice. I would go
to Memphis, Tennessee, for the trial. I sat in the courtroom
for a week not--my name is not mentioned one time. At the end
of the presentation of the plaintiff's case the judge--the
first time my attorney says anything is will you dismiss my
client and the judge says yes. And so you know I am kind of
stunned. I don't know what is going on. I am walking out of the
room and the plaintiff's attorney stops me and says--shakes my
hand and says, you know, no offense. And I am saying--here, you
know I have just been stabbed in the back and no big deal. And
that is just one. I could go on with other.
Mr. Pitts. Thank you. Dr. Kachalia, you and your colleague
Michelle Mello have done an exhaustive review of this issue,
possibly the most exhaustive review to date. From what I can
tell, part of your message is that the data regarding some
aspects of medical liability reform are not robust at this
time. However, there does seem to be mature data about caps on
noneconomic damages. I found it interesting in your research
that caps do not seem to reduce the number of claims, but
study--studies of the effects on caps on claim payouts have
found a significant effect--typically on the order of 20 to 30
percent reduction in the average award size. If the number of
claims remains stable, it would seem that patients are still
able to bring cases, but the number of unpredictably high
awards is reduced. That seems like exactly what we would want
medical liability reform to do. In your opinion is that a fair
thing to say? Would you elaborate?
Mr. Kachalia. So, I think you are right with regard to what
we would want liability reform to do which is to bring--if
awards are thought to be excessive to make them more
reasonable. And with regard to caps they do seem to--as you
pointed out, they do seem to lower the average payment and the
premiums to go with it. And they--from what we can see from the
evidence they don't seem to have an effect on the total number
of claims that occur. So if caps were working without harming
patient access to compensation, that is exactly how we would
want them to work, but most of these studies weren't
necessarily--they don't necessarily tell us as you pointed
out--there is very little data with regard to what happens to
patient access to compensation in overall quality of care. So
those still remain unknown questions. But you are right, at the
end of the day to some extent caps can help lower the premiums
which is what they are meaning to do.
Mr. Pitts. My time is expired. Chair recognizes the ranking
member for 5 minutes for questions.
Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do appreciate your
having this hearing today because I can't support and never
have supported H.R. 5, but I do understand that medical
malpractice and liability is a real problem for doctors in my
home State in the country. But I also think we can't forget
that medical malpractice reform also affects patients and any
truer form has to take a balanced approach and include
protections for the legal rights of patients, because many
people are serious injured through medical malpractice.
Now I want to focus on three things which I have been
articulating for years about H.R. 5. It has been around--I
don't know how many times we have taken this up, you know,
since--when the Republicans were in the majority. I have three
problems with it. First of all it extends way beyond medical
malpractice. You know it has new protection and nursing home,
pharmaceuticals, device, insurance companies and others and I
really feel very strongly that if we are really going to focus
on this issue it just should be medical malpractice. It
shouldn't be all these other types of tort reform.
The second thing is that the 250,000 cap is just unworkable
and unrealistic. I mean it has been around for 10, 20 years and
you know, with inflation and everything you talk about $250,000
cap I just think is unrealistic. And the last thing is I don't
believe that just having caps is going to truly control
premiums. I think the only--I mean it may be a factor, but a
more important factor is actually having some kind of controls
on the premiums themselves. You know some kind of you know
actual way of saying, you know, premiums can't go above a
certain amount, whatever. So those are my questions. I want to
ask questions and I am going to try to get all three in in the
3 minutes that I have left. Let me start with Ms. Doroshow.
First of all, this $250,000 cap, it seems to me it is very
unrealistic and secondly the idea of just tort reform being an
answer to reducing or controlling premiums for doctors--I mean
isn't it true that in California example--I know Mr. Waxman has
often used this as an example that you know when they just did
the tort reform premiums kept going up. And it wasn't until
they actually instituted something I guess with one of their
propositions that actually said--that addressed prices. And so
if you would ask me that a 250 cap and the need for price
controls or however you want to call it and not just talking
about the caps?
Ms. Doroshow. Well, look at California because that was the
State that first enacted a $250,000 cap in 1975 without an
inflation adjustment. And I think if you were to adjust to
today this would be well over a million dollars in terms of a
limit. It is incredibly low and cruel amount of money that as
Brian mentioned has a disproportionate impact on seniors,
children, low wage earners, women who don't work outside the
home.
In terms of the insurance issue, after the cap passed rates
went up about 450 percent until 1988 when Prop 103 passed. This
is the strongest insurance regulatory law in the country and
since then rates have stayed below what the national average
is. And in the last hard market between 2001--2003 there were--
or 2005 there were three attempts by insurers in California to
raise rates. Because of Prop 103 there is a hearing
requirement. The consumer groups came in, challenged the rate
hikes and all three of them were reduced saving doctors about
$66 million in California. Nothing will work unless you
institute insurance reform.
Mr. Pallone. All right, let me just--and I appreciate this
answer to the questions, but Mr. Wolfman, to my third point
which is this bill you know not just dealing with all these
other tort reforms with farm devices, all that. I mean is that
necessary? Isn't the problem primarily with doctors? Why are we
throwing all the--the kitchen sink in here?
Mr. Wolfman. Representative Pallone, as I said the--this
bill seems--I am not here to speak about malpractice, but this
seems particularly ill fitted to claims against device and drug
manufacturers that bring out enormous or war chests to litigate
cases. And the notion that you in difficult cases where you
need the best lawyers, the notion that you can go forward when
there is extreme negligence with no opportunity for punitive
damages. A $250,000 cap and these draconian nonmarket
limitations on attorney's fees is just fantastic. It is not
going to happen. And----
Mr. Pallone. Well, let me say this, Mr. Chairman, you know
I just want you to know that if you and the Republicans were
willing to work with us on these three issues, you know
unrealistic cap, just narrowing this to doctors or medical
malpractice, and third you know including actual going after
the rates and actually controlling rates then I think we could
come to a workable solution. But the way H.R. 5 is now, it is
going to--same thing over and over again. It will never go
anywhere and it is just a waste of time.
Mr. Pitts. Gentleman's time is expired. Chair recognizes
the vice chairman of the committee, Dr. Burgess, for 5 minutes
for questions.
Mr. Burgess. I thank the chairman. You know I am actually
tempted to ask the gentleman from New Jersey if he would look
at 896 since he just made that gracious offer. On the other
hand, Texas receives so many of your recently educated
physicians from New Jersey that I am worried about disrupting
our physician workforce pipeline because, as you know, we did
pass a year ago or sign into law a year ago a bill--you may
have heard of it--called the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, which is going to ensure according to congressional
an additional 32 million people. And although I have my doubts
about that figure, they are all going to need doctors. In Texas
we may be well on the way to satisfying that demand because we
have done the right thing with liability reform on the ground
in Texas.
I am so intrigued by the concept of what has been talked
about on limiting attorney's fees. You know, maybe doctors have
gone about it the wrong way. Maybe we should have gone to the
billable hour several years ago and not let Medicare dictate
our fees as has happened in this country for years. But we do
live under a federally imposed fee schedule and maybe if we
could apply that to our legal brethren maybe some of these
problems would go away as well so I am going to be on the phone
to Dr. Berwick shortly after this hearing ends and see if we
cannot extend the benefits of the sustainable growth rate
formula to the Nation's attorneys.
Well, we did pass medical liability reform in 2003. Dr.
Hollier, do recall did anything similar to the proposition in
California pass that limited--was a price control on medical
liability, the cost of the insurance itself, or were simply the
reforms that we built into the system? Of course the
legislature passed the law in June of 2003. The State passed--
the people of the State of Texas passed a constitutional
amendment in September of 2003 that allowed the law to
circumvent the court's process and become immediately
implemented. That seemed to me to be the big break point, not
putting a cap on what malpractice insurance can charge. Can you
address that?
Ms. Hollier. Yes, sir, there were no additional measures
such as those implemented in California. Liability premiums for
physicians began to decrease relatively soon after the
September passage of the amendment. And physicians had seen
their liability premiums decrease by about 28 percent keeping
many of these doctors in their practice keeping patients with
the ability to access the specialty care that they need close
to home.
Mr. Burgess. Yes, of course you work in a medical school
and it is not just a medical school. It is my medical school,
so I am grateful for your service there. But give us an idea of
what that 28 percent means to the practicing OB-GYN in the
greater Houston metropolitan area.
Ms. Hollier. For many physicians prior to liability reform,
obstetrician/gynecologists were paying premiums in excess of
$100,000, some as high as $150,000. So 28 percent reductions
are very important. And what it means for our doctors is that
we can continue to stay in practice and provide care for our
patients.
Mr. Burgess. And the story about counties in Texas having
ER doctors and OB-GYNs that had never had one before is that
just some fantasy made up by doctors or is that an actual fact?
Ms. Hollier. That is an actual fact, Representative
Burgess.
Mr. Burgess. And you know we talk about Texas, but let me
talk about New York for a moment because I happened to be in
New York a couple of weeks ago and the New York Times had this
wonderful ad. When these doctors say we need liability reform
there are 350,000 reasons to trust them and there you see what
I like to call mature physicians standing there holding infants
in their arms. And I asked--this was given to me by the head of
the Greater New York Hospital Association, and I asked him what
the liability premium was in the city of New York for an OB-GYN
and he said in excess of $200,000. And clearly that is a
barrier for the young physician getting out of their medical
school and their residency experience. And they probably owe--
well, Dr. Hollier or Dr. Kachalia, tell us what is a young
doctor likely to owe today getting out of a 4-year OB-GYN
residency? $150,000 in student loans, $200,000?
Ms. Hollier. I think that is a reasonable estimate, sir.
Mr. Burgess. And on top of that before they can deliver
their first baby a $200,000 liability payment because no one
can afford to practice--you couldn't dare run the risk of
practicing without liability insurance. So how in the world are
we asking our cadre of young doctors to begin practice in--with
this environment in the city of New York? No wonder they look
to the allegiant fields of Houston, Texas, and Fort Worth,
Texas. They may not be green fields, because it is pretty hot
in the summertime, but they are certainly greener fields than
in New York. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks the gentleman and now recognizes
the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Gonzalez for questions.
Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Dr.
Hollier, do we have a medical malpractice--not an emergency,
but let--not a crisis, but do we have medical malpractice
problems in the State of Texas?
Ms. Hollier. Sorry, sir. I think the climate in Texas has
changed dramatically post reform. And I think our patients have
had significant benefits.
Mr. Gonzalez. Well, let me ask you. I will put it this way.
Do we have occurrences of medical malpractice in Texas?
Ms. Hollier. Yes, sir.
Mr. Gonzalez. But those doctors make mistakes?
Ms. Hollier. Yes, sir.
Mr. Gonzalez. And sometimes they are pretty serious
mistakes?
Ms. Hollier. Yes, sir.
Mr. Gonzalez. All right, you know a lot of doctors, don't
you, I assume? And if I was a member of your family would there
be certain doctors that you would not recommend that I go to,
honestly?
Ms. Hollier. I don't have a list in my mind such as that.
Mr. Gonzalez. OK. Dr. Tippett, in Florida are there
occurrences of medical malpractice?
Mr. Tippett. Yes, sir, there are occurrences of
malpractice, but what we are talking about here is to try to
continue to provide access to medical care in the State of
Florida. In South Florida, for example, most----
Mr. Gonzalez. And Doctor, I only have 5 minutes and I
understand where you are going, but since I only have the 5
minutes I would like to get where I would like to get but I end
up in this discussion. You know a lot of doctors. If I was a
member of your family, would there be certain doctors that you
wouldn't recommend I see?
Mr. Tippett. Would not recommend you see?
Mr. Gonzalez. Sure.
Mr. Tippett. I would put it in the other way. There are
certain doctors that I would prefer over some other physicians.
For example, I sent my daughter yesterday to my partner. I
think that----
Mr. Gonzalez. But why would I send them to the doctors at
the bottom of the list?
Mr. Tippett. I am sorry?
Mr. Gonzalez. Why wouldn't you send your daughter to those
doctors at the bottom of this hierarchy of qualified doctors?
You are sending them to the one that you respect the most. I
understand that. But you must have questions about all those
others that are practicing that you would not send your
daughter to.
Mr. Tippett. Well, I wouldn't send my daughter to every
doctor in town. I would only pick out as you would in your
family the one you thought that was most appropriate.
Mr. Gonzalez. Well, that is my point.
Mr. Tippett. It is not always based on quality of the care.
It is based on whether all of those factors----
Mr. Gonzalez. Qualifications, ability, and competency in
every profession, including the legal. That is why we have
malpractice suits, because I will tell you this: In my private
conversations with my friends who are doctors they would
definitely tell me who to stay away from. And I venture to
guess anybody up here today that has a dear friend or a family
member or even Dr. Burgess himself who is a physician before he
came to Congress obviously--knows those members of the medical
profession that pose a danger to their patients.
But like any profession we are going to have that. The
problem is the profession doesn't really discipline and
regulate itself. Most professions don't. So somehow we have to
have a system that will protect the rights of those patients. I
understand where we are all coming from: affordable healthcare,
quality healthcare, defensive medicine and so on. So let us
look at the Texas experiment. This is the goal standard, the
goal standard.
Average liability premium for internal medicine--
malpractice premiums for internal medicine are 27 percent
higher in Texas than in States without caps because what we are
trying to do is take that basic cost out of the equation and
provide quality healthcare for everyone. But if someone is
injured as a result of negligence they may just be left out in
the cold. But let us just leave that aside. What we are trying
to accomplish is reducing malpractice insurance premiums.
General surgeons, OB-GYN malpractice premiums for doctors
averaged across specialties are 6 percent higher in Texas than
in States without caps. Malpractice premiums for general
surgery are 21 percent higher in Texas than in States without
caps.
Those are the realities and we also know that the practice
of defensive medicine may be an issue, but studies also show
that that may be more attributable to overutilization because
we know that is out there. It also may be due to unreasonable
patients that is bigger--I have got an insurance company or the
government's going to pay so run every test that you can run on
me. There are other reasons for the increased testing other
than what we have referred to as defensive medicine. I am just
saying let us be fair to the physician, but let us be fair to
the patient and make sure that they have an adequate remedy
when they are injured, disfigured, and disabled. Thank you, I
yield back.
Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks the gentleman. Yields 5 minutes to
the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey.
Mr. Gingrey. I thank the chairman for yielding. Let me
first go to Ms. Doroshow. I see that you represent the Center
for Justice and Democracy. Let me ask you a series of questions
and these are just strictly yes or no. Do you believe that all
Americans in this country deserve justice?
Ms. Doroshow. Yes.
Mr. Gingrey. That is easy. Do you believe that medical
providers should be held financially responsible for their
share of medical errors?
Ms. Doroshow. If they are fully responsible.
Mr. Gingrey. Yes or no? Their share of medical errors?
Ms. Doroshow. Well, are you talking about the----
Mr. Gingrey. If I say their share, obviously the question
means they are not fully responsible. They have made some
responsibility. I am asking you yes or no, should they be held
financially responsible for their share of the medical error?
Ms. Doroshow. If the----
Mr. Gingrey. Yes or no?
Ms. Doroshow. Yes, but----
Mr. Gingrey. All right, your answer is yes. I have got
another--a number of questions so we need to move on. Do you
believe that medical providers should be sued and held
financially responsible for medical errors that they did not
cause? Surely you can answer that yes or no.
Ms. Doroshow. I think not. That is correct.
Mr. Gingrey. They should be?
Ms. Doroshow. No, they shouldn't.
Mr. Gingrey. Thank you. I expected that. Do you believe
that off-duty medical providers who happen to witness a
horrible car crash and step in because victim's life hangs in
the balance should have liability protections, understanding
that oftentimes they would be working without the benefit of
any medical equipment or a stable environment? They are on the
street. They are trying to provide emergency care. Should they
be held liability?
Ms. Doroshow. These are good Samaritan laws and they--most
States have them. That is different from an emergency room law.
Mr. Gingrey. So most States have a law that would hold them
not liable?
Ms. Doroshow. Right.
Mr. Gingrey. Your answer is yes.
Ms. Doroshow. They are not expected to encounter----
Mr. Gingrey. Thank you. So basically the reason I ask you
these questions is justice is a subjective term for your
organization. Is it not? Is justice a subjective term?
Mr. Doroshow. Exactly. I mean this is a determination by
the jury if you are talking about a lawsuit, and that is what
we believe in, the judge and jury.
Mr. Gingery. Well, we don't have a jury here. We just
simply have a panel of witnesses----
Ms. Doroshow. Well, we are talking about the civil justice
system.
Mr. Gingrey. And I am asking you pretty straightforward yes
or no question. OK. Well, let me move on. Thank you very much
for your response. I am going to go to Dr. Tippett. Dr.
Tippett, thank you for your testimony. I have heard from many
medical providers that in the bill PPACA, Affordable Care Act
we sometimes refer to it on this side as Obamacare, not
pejoratively, of course. We--you know it has created some new
liability concerns. How does Obamacare create new liability
concerns, Dr. Tippett?
Mr. Tippett. Well, there are any number of ways and it is
so we don't yet know about what many things that may come of
this progress, but of this bill. But for example if some panel
determines that you can't have this sort of treatment under
Medicare and you have the treatment anyway, and things don't go
well, you may be sued in that regard. We considered this bill
when we looked at it overall as a growth industry for the
plaintiffs bar in terms of things that they could find that
doctors do wrong. When there--comparative effectiveness I think
is probably the most fertile ground for the plaintiffs bar. Any
time----
Mr. Gingrey. Well, let me--I want to interrupt you just for
a second because I get your drift. Do you then think that
medical providers need to be protected from these new liability
causes of action that may be embedded in the new Obamacare law?
Mr. Tippett. Absolutely, yes, sir.
Mr. Gingrey. Well, I want to once again let the panel know
that I have a bipartisan bill, bipartisan bill H.R. 816 and I
hope Congress will move quickly because if Obamacare is going
to deepen this liability crisis it must be stopped. And of
course that is what the provider shield law will actually do,
and I think it is very important that we get that passed. Let
me in my remaining minute to go to Dr. Hollier. Dr. Hollier, it
is great to have you as a witness because you are a fellow OB-
GYN, an American College of OB-GYN. And I am a very, very proud
member and I practiced in that specialty as you probably know
for 26 years delivering over 5,000 babies, so it is near and
dear to my heart and I appreciate you being with us. According
to studies almost 30 percent of OB-GYNs have increased the
number of cesarean deliveries and 26 percent have stopped
performing or offering traditional deliveries because of
liability concerns and defensive medicine. Is that correct?
Ms. Hollier. Yes, sir. According to our recent surveys by
the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologist our
physicians are increasing those.
Mr. Gingrey. All right, very quickly are cesarean
deliveries more expensive than traditional--let us say a VBAC
vaginal birth after a cesarean delivery?
Ms. Hollier. Yes, sir.
Mr. Gingrey. You state in your testimony that patients who
eventually receive compensation through our current liability
system obtain less than 50 percent of the amount awarded. What
happens to the remaining 50 percent of the judgment or
settlement?
Ms. Hollier. That goes to the attorney, sir.
Mr. Gingrey. It goes to who?
Ms. Hollier. The attorneys.
Mr. Gingrey. OK. Thank you and I see my time is expired. I
yield back.
Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks the gentleman. Now recognizes the
Ranking Member from California, Mr. Waxman for 5 minutes of
questions.
Mr. Waxman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I think
medical malpractice is a real problem. I don't think the system
is a very good one. People who should be compensated when they
are hurt are often not because their cases are not attractive
enough for a lawyer to take on. Some people are
overcompensated. There is not justice in the system and this
has been a perplexing issue for many, many years.
In California, we adopted a law that--called MICRA which
has been the law that many other States are emulating and a
good part of the bill H.R. 5 is based on MICRA. But I have a
question about whether we ought to be doing this at the Federal
level. States have tried different approaches. There is no
perfect approach to this unless you want to say it is about the
providers. Providers will never be responsible even when they
are negligent or even in reckless. I don't think that makes any
sense. I don't like some of these caps. Frankly it is such a
low cap and hasn't been expanded so that--$250,000 seems to be
an inadequate compensation for people who are going to live the
rest of their lives disfigured and in pain.
So I think it is still a State matter because the States
have jurisdiction over insurance. The States have jurisdiction
over licensure. One of the ways to deal with doctors who commit
malpractice is to--is for--to have their peers under State law
do something about it. That is a State matter. All States have
already examined this issue of medical reform, liability reform
and they have their own different systems, but we want to now
in this bill preempt the whole matter and make it a one size
fits all. That is why the National Conference of State
Legislatures has written to express its strong bipartisan
opposition to H.R. 5, and Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask
unanimous consent to put their letter into the record.
Mr. Pitts. Without objection, so ordered.
[The information follows:]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T1612.200

Mr. Waxman. Ms. Doroshow, am I correct in my statement that
States are trying different things out?
Ms. Doroshow. That States----
Mr. Waxman. Are doing different things on their own?
Ms. Doroshow. Well, yes, they have for 35 years.
Mr. Waxman. Now Section 11 of this bill spells out to the
extent to which State medical liability laws would be abolished
or prevented from being enacted in the first place, in other
words preempted. Ironically, the title of this section is State
Flexibility and Protection of State's Rights but it preempts
the States if they don't follow the Federal model.
Professor Wolfman, can--what would this Section 11 mean for
existing or potential State medical liability reform laws?
Mr. Wolfman. Well, essentially it is essentially one way
preemption. What it does is it preempts States. For instance if
a State had a law saying or a policy that you know the jury can
determine what is appropriate noneconomic damages that would be
preempted. But if a State had a provision that was more
punitive in my view, you know a $200,000 cap, that would not be
preempted.
Mr. Waxman. That would----
Mr. Wolfman. One way.
Mr. Waxman. There is a provision in this bill that says if
it--if there is greater protection in healthcare providers and
healthcare organizations----
Mr. Wolfman. That is correct.
Mr. Waxman [continuing]. That would not be preempted.
Mr. Wolfman. That is absolutely correct.
Mr. Waxman. But the bill goes on to preempt State laws to
protect consumers?
Mr. Wolfman. That is correct. It is one way.
Mr. Waxman. That is a one-way preemption. California's law
has worked as I understand it to hold down insurance premium
from malpractice, but that also seems to have been part of the
insurance reforms adopted by the State. I don't know if any of
you--Ms. Doroshow, you have lived in California over----
Ms. Doroshow. Yes. What----
Mr. Waxman. Is that an accurate statement?
Ms. Doroshow. It is the Prop 103 insurance regulatory law
that passed in 1988 that is primarily responsible for that.
Yes, for controlling rates in California.
Mr. Waxman. Do you know if any evaluation has been done of
the California medical situation to see whether it has stopped
excessive practice in medicine or defensive medicine?
Ms. Doroshow. In----
Mr. Waxman. Or is defensive medicine practiced in
California the same as other places?
Ms. Doroshow. As well as Texas. I mean, it--when you enact
these caps and other tort reforms it has absolutely no effect
on that issue. I mean, how could it? You are just limiting one
small measure of damages and in a case it is not is going to
change somebody's practice. And I think that is generally what
has been true. It certainly was true according to a very well-
known article about Texas, McAllen, Texas in the New Yorker
Magazine where they talked to some cardiologist and sat down
and said they acknowledged the $250,000 cap had practically
wiped out law suits in that State and yet they were still
practicing the same kind of tests. And they attributed it--
admitted that it was due to overutilization, having nothing to
do with the legal system.
Mr. Waxman. I would like my colleagues that support this
bill which may well be almost all the Republicans, maybe all of
them. I still think there are states' rights and states'
prerogatives, and this really tramples on all of that. And that
troubles me a lot. All answers to questions are not found in
Washington, DC. Yield back my time.
Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks the gentleman and now recognizes
the gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Guthrie for 5 minutes of
questions.
Mr. Guthrie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My friend from Texas
said who is left out in the cold and what is fair for the
patient. And in the terms of access to legal representation and
you would have to say perhaps that there would be if you limit
fees--obviously if you are going to limit price, price
controls--you know people are going to in turn to that business
as often. But the question as I have listened to the Texas
story and I can tell you about Kentucky is what is fair for the
patient in term of access to healthcare? I mean, that is the
issue that we have. I believe if I am correct 22 rural counties
gained OB-GYNs and 10 counties had an OB-GYN that did not have.
In my situation I have three children. If I had a fourth, we
couldn't have the same doctor who delivered the first three
because he doesn't practice OB because of medical malpractice
specifically for that. Two hospitals in my hometown, one
doesn't do OB anymore because of medical malpractice. Now there
is a hospital across town you can go to, but if you get into
rural parts of Kentucky, it--you can't--and it is part of the
eastern part of the State you have to drive a couple hours to
Lexington. You know about disproportionate effect on the poor.
Not that middle class and upper middle class people don't have
to drive 2 hours, but they can afford it a lot easier than
somebody that is poor.
And I am telling you if you give free healthcare to
somebody in parts of my State they are not going to be able to
go to a doctor unless they drive 2 or--over 2 hours because of
access to medical care. An OB-GYN that I am very close to has
to pay $105,000 for healthcare OB-GYN practice in Kentucky. So
that is why we are losing people practicing.
So even if you admit and I think you would have to if you
are a person that doesn't believe in--if you--economics and you
said the free market of price controls would perhaps limit some
people to big awards, the overall--what we have to look at and
Ms. Doroshow, is it a fair argument to look at to say well,
what about the access? Because you know some people are arguing
that tort reform didn't change the issues in Texas. You know
the evidence seems to say they did, but I can tell you we are
losing OB-GYNs. If it is not tort reform for some reason in
Kentucky and it is the access to care not something that we as
policymakers have to make decisions when we--what is fair for
one patient--maybe access to the legal. What is fair for one
patient--access to care.
Ms. Doroshow. Well, I would point you to page 23 of my
written testimony where it describes study after study after
government study showing that medical malpractice issues have
absolutely nothing to do with the access to care argument. And
frankly, if the argument is that insurance rates are too high
as they have been three times in the last 30 years as we have
gone through this cyclical market, the solutions to that
problem lie with the insurance industry. They should not be
solved on the backs of injured patients. And we are dedicated.
We have an organization called Americans for Insurance Reform
that is dedicated to try to help get some control over the
property, casualty insurance industry. That is one of the least
regulated industries in the country. They are exempt from anti-
trust laws and that is something that Congress could do is to
get rid of the anti-trust exemption that----
Mr. Guthrie. What about the Texas situation? The Texas--
didn't--I am asking. I am not trying to lead you in a way or
Mr. Wolfman, did Texas malpractice reform not lower premiums?
Is that--are you thinking it was something outside of? Because
they didn't put caps in control.
Ms. Doroshow. Texas--right after the law was passed in
2003, Texas insurers went in for between a 35 and 65 request
for rate hikes. That is because we are in a hard market in this
country. It was happening in every State in the country. In
2006, rates stabilized everywhere in the country. In every
State in the country no matter whether they passed these laws
or not and that simply as----
Mr. Guthrie. But so the access in these rural counties in
Texas--was it, you don't think----
Ms. Doroshow. The access to the rural counties--look in
2007 there is a big Texas Observer article called ``Baby I
Lied.'' It was all about how misrepresenting the medical
societies word in terms of where the access was going to
improve in those rural counties and they were not--they had not
improved. And I would also point you to this very important
study by Charles Silver, David Hymen, Bernard Black, the impact
of the 2003 medical malpractice and its cap on physicians
supply. Basically the account----
Mr. Guthrie. I am not cutting you off because I don't want
to hear it and I----
Ms. Doroshow. Well, this is----
Mr. Guthrie [continuing]. Understand----
Ms. Doroshow. This is the actual analysis of what happened
to physician supply in Texas. The----
Mr. Guthrie. But I know we are losing OB-GYNs in Kentucky
and rural part and maybe there are lots other but as a doctor,
I know you just--what you said. I am not trying to cut you off
because I don't want to hear it. I just want to give Dr.
Hollier--I guess you have 20 seconds to say that.
Ms. Hollier. Thanks. Ranks of rural obstetricians increased
by 27 percent. Imagine yourself 9 months----
Mr. Guthrie. Because of malpractice or that is the question
that--that is this----
Ms. Hollier. Yes.
Mr. Guthrie. You are not denying the increase, right, Dr.
Doroshow?
Ms. Doroshow. Yes, I am denying it.
Mr. Guthrie. You are denying that it increased? OK.
Ms. Doroshow. According to this study, population went up 2
percent. OB-GYNs went up 1.6 percent annually since the cap
passed.
Mr. Guthrie. But we have OB-GYNs in Bowling Green. The
question is we don't have then in some county----
Ms. Doroshow. Well there are dual problems that are very
common in every single State. The way to fix that problem is to
provide incentives for doctors to go into those areas not to
cap damages for the entire State.
Mr. Guthrie. But they did in Texas. That is the question.
Thanks. I yield back.
Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks gentleman and recognizes gentlelady
from California, Mrs. Capps for 5 minutes.
Mrs. Capps. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As I touched on in my
opening today I believe that in order to solve the issues of
rising malpractice costs, we can't ignore one of the major
issues here which is reducing the incidents of malpractice,
bringing down the astounding number of costly medical errors
that claim 98,000 lives a year. I want to be clear many of
these deaths would be wholly preventable through the adoption
of simple measures like increased focus on communication
between doctors and nurses, appropriate staffing levels as
increasing the use of simple but effective checklists.
To that end, I join with my colleague Mr. Holt on--in
introducing the Medical Checklist Act of 2010 in the 111th
Congress. Checklists have long been used in commercial aviation
as well as the number of other fields to ensure that
complicated procedures are performed safely. They have been
used because they work and their increased use in medical
centers--settings is one way to improve patient test--safety.
In your testimony, Ms. Doroshow, you spoke of the importance of
focusing on patient safety and highlighted how one study in
obstetrics department was able to reduce medical errors in
claims by 99.1 percent by instituting a department wide program
focused on ways that they can improve patient care; for
example, establishing new drug protocols, improving
communications between medical staff. What kind of incentives
do you believe prompted the implementation of this systemic
approach to improving patient safety? Do you think this kind of
program could be replicated in other hospitals or other
branches of medicine?
Ms. Doroshow. Absolutely and in fact it is not the only--it
is New York Presbyterian Cornell Medical Center study beginning
in 2002. At the request of the insurance carrier for this
hospital, they implemented these things and as you said
claims--everything went down. But it is not the only situation
where that has been repeated. We also had somebody testify
before, a task force I was on from a Boston hospital the same
kind of results. It is extraordinarily successful at reducing
errors and claims in compensation payments.
Mrs. Capps. And then real quickly in your reading of H.R. 5
is there anything that improves on patient protection measures
that reduce the instance of medical errors?
Ms. Doroshow. No, absolutely not.
Mrs. Capps. OK. Well, I think this is an area where all of
us can agree that this kind of approach, these innovative
approaches are--is worth learning from. I want to turn now to
Dr. Kachalia. In your testimony, you described your review of
the current evidence regarding the effective liability reform
measures such as those contained in H.R. 5, you say for example
there is not enough evidence to evaluate the impact of caps on
the overall quality of care. I found the paper that you did in
2008 very interesting. You wrote that with regard to problems
of liability costs and quality, there is a growing awareness
and this is a quote from your statement--your letter.
``Traditional tort reform measures such as caps on noneconomic
damages will not solve them.'' You go on to say that ``There is
also increasing recognition that such measures do little or
nothing to make care safer. Would you agree then, Dr. Kachalia,
that the grants program included in the Affordable Care Act
that permits States to conduct pilot projects to test some of
these methods is a sensible first step before we enact sweeping
legislation that would impose a batter of tort reform
provisions on all States? And kind of a yes or no, because I
will...
Mr. Kachalia. So----
Mrs. Capps. Actually, I have time.
Mr. Kachalia. So yes, I actually think the grants program
that is being contemplated is a great thing because as we look
to improve our liability system we should be looking to see how
we can improve the quality of the safety of the care that we
deliver at the same time. So as we--I think there is general
recognition also that we need to fix the premium problem. We
need to fix this issue with excessive economic awards, but at
the same time there is no reason we couldn't package this with
other measures that will also help with safety. So I think a
grants program to investigate and give us more data on how to
fix these problems is all--would be a welcome thing.
Mrs. Capps. And to corroborate that, Ms. Doroshow, the
Affordable Care Act does include grants and encourage States to
experiment with various methods to address medical liability in
their State. Of course in keeping with the way that we have
always treated medical as a State and not a Federal issue, do
you want to comment on the same kinds of programs that you have
seen where States are kind of testing the waters to see if
there are programs that they can implement at the State level?
Ms. Doroshow. Yes, I mean a number of grants were made by
HHS and we are waiting to see the results of those. Most of
them are very focused on patients safety which I think is the
correct way to go in solving this problem.
Mrs. Capps. Thank you. And I yield back my time but I ask
unanimous consent to insert in the record a letter from the
Consumer Watchdog that clearly shows that caps alone did
nothing to decrease medical malpractice premiums by the study.
Mr. Pitts. Without objection, so ordered.

Mr. Pitts. Chair now recognizes the gentleman from
Illinois, Mr. Shimkus, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Shimkus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a really
great hearing. I have been a Member since '96. We have dealt
with this numerous times. And it is not an easy issue, and so I
appreciate all the folks at the panel. First, Mr. Chairman, I
would like to submit into the record two articles. One November
14, 2010; March 9, 2011, New York Times, and I don't know who
this was. And it----
Mr. Pitts. Without objection.

Mr. Shimkus. It addresses an issue of loaning money, in
essence usury and rates within the States. Let me read the
paragraph: ``Large banks, hedge funds and private investors
hungry for new and lucrative opportunities are bankrolling
other people's lawsuits, pumping hundreds of millions of
dollars into medical malpractice claims, divorce battles and
class actions against corporations--all in the hope of sharing
in the potential winnings.'' So they are using medical issues
and there is a--actually, there really is a debate now in
States and whether this is a State issue or Federal issue I am
still going to try to reconcile that debate. It has been raised
up, but States are--we are involved with credit card rates now
here nationally. States are involved in loan sharking and
payday loan issues and rates, so I would like to submit that.
And I have got some other things, but Dr. Tippett, you are a
neurosurgeon? Is that correct?
Mr. Tippett. Yes, sir, I am a neurosurgeon.
Mr. Shimkus. And in Illinois we have gone on and off of
medical liability reforms and we just had one. It just got
overruled by the Supreme Court. Now we are kind of in limbo
until we see if anything else could pass. Before the last
passage of State Liability Reforms we did not have a single
neurosurgeon south of Springfield, Illinois, which is parts of
52 counties. Now as a practitioner of that specialty that is a
danger sign,s wouldn't you think?
Mr. Tippett. Absolutely. You talk about--everybody's
talking about what do we want to do about patient safety and I
am thinking when you don't have someone there to take care of
the patient it is not very safe. If you have got to travel 500
miles to get to see a doctor, that is not safe.
Mr. Shimkus. Fifty-two counties, yes.
Mr. Tippett. We are all for patient safety, but you have to
have the physician access.
Mr. Shimkus. Yes, reclaiming my time. Fifty-two counties is
a third of the State of Illinois, and at that time we would
have to airlift folks who are in critical acts--I mean to
airlift them 100, 150 miles maybe to New York--not New York to
St. Louis, Dens Sens, maybe Paducah, to other places who had
across the State line who had neurosurgeons because they had
lower--and that is why I think if you hear the testimony of
some of the members' concerns, we are from rural districts. We
are from districts that have problems with access to care and
that is where our passion for this debate comes from. So I
just--I will put that on the table.
The other thing I found interesting, Ms. Doroshow, and I
appreciate your testimony. I appreciate you raising this issue
of Dr. Lora Ellenson and the quotes in there and the story.
Because I think if I ask this question to everyone--this is the
doctor who has the disabled son that wants a judgment to be
made to pay for the care of that son for the rest of his life.
No one at this panel would disagree with that. Would you? Would
you, Dr. Hollier? Would you disagree?
Ms. Hollier. Would not disagree.
Mr. Shimkus. Ms. Doroshow, would you disagree?
Ms. Doroshow. Would not.
Mr. Shimkus. Yes, Dr. Kachalia? You wouldn't disagree. Mr.
Wolfman?
Mr. Wolfman. No.
Mr. Shimkus. Dr. Tippett?
Mr. Tippett. Absolutely not.
Mr. Shimkus. So no one would disagree with it. There is
something that we can all agree upon. Now this debate is really
about--and I am not a lawyer, OK, and sometimes I wish I was
and sometimes I am glad I am not--but this is the issue of the
second part of a medical liability claim which is pain and
suffering. Now, this is in the issue because the Governor of
New York is trying to cap pain and suffering at $250,000. Is
that correct, Ms. Doroshow?
Ms. Doroshow. That is--no. I mean, that was----
Mr. Shimkus. Yes, that was in the story that you used it
for?
Ms. Doroshow. No, that is over it. That was withdrawn.
Mr. Shimkus. OK, but it was.
Ms. Doroshow. That was withdrawn.
Mr. Shimkus. But it was----
Ms. Doroshow. It was the hospitals that were on a refined
scheme that----
Mr. Shimkus. All right, do I want to read the story that
you quote in your--do I want to read the story?
Ms. Doroshow. Well----
Mr. Shimkus. The story----
Ms. Doroshow. Since I wasn't involved in it----
Mr. Shimkus. OK. I don't want to fight this.
Ms. Doroshow [continuing]. I can----
Mr. Shimkus. The story is based on Cuomo had proposed
capping at $250,000. That is part of the story that you used.
And I don't want to go on that fight, but that is what raised
this story was her concern of Governor Cuomo's.
Ms. Doroshow. Well----
Mr. Shimkus. Now the issue was this. Mr. Chairman, the time
is mine. The time is not the ranking member of the full
committee's, and I ask for my 15----
Mr. Pitts. Shimkus----
Mr. Shimkus [continuing]. Seconds returned based upon the
disruption by the ranking member.
Mr. Pitts. You may proceed.
Mr. Shimkus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Now the issue is
this, that in a court case what we should have--there is
economic damages that should be recovered. This issue of pain
and suffering is what is driving this. Now in California, one
economic damage case recovered $96 million. So this debate is
about the pain and suffering aspect that actuarially insurers
can never quantify because there is no cap. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I yield back my time.
Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks the gentleman and recognizes the
gentleman from New York, Mr. Weiner, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Weiner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, I think that
Mr. Gingrey's question earlier should inform our debate about
who should make these decisions. Now Mr. Gingrey suggested in
his questions that you should or he should, when in fact we
have a history of jurisprudence in this country that empowers
our constituents to make these decisions, that they are smart
enough to send Mr. Gingrey to Congress, they should be smart
enough to sit on a jury. Or alternatively they should be smart
enough to pass State laws. It is interesting that in Mr.
Gingrey's explanation of Constitutional authority for this
bill, he writes the Constitutional authority in which this
legislation is based is on Article I, Section VIII, Clause III
of the Constitution as healthcare related lawsuits are
activities that affect interstate commerce. If that is the
explanation for trumping tort law in the States where does--so
we can take this book--this is New Jersey's law and say that
apparently Congress knows better. So we are going to trump
State law. Like there is not a Federal tort regime now. It is
basically they are in the individual States. It is the right of
the States. The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution reserves
this for the States. Why stop there? If we are not going allow
the State to make health-related tort laws, then who is going
to decide? I am impressed with Mr. Wolfman--and, by the way, I
am not a lawyer, but if we ever had a law firm Wolfman and
Weiner, I mean, we would just--I am serious, we would just get
clients just on the sheer intimidation factor. But perhaps you
can talk a little bit about the idea that there are some areas
of the law that we reserve for the States and the effect that
this would have on the regime of State tort law because
frankly, we could really go to every extreme. You really could
say that every court case can be decided in this room
theoretically. I mean, if you are going to say, if you are
going to trump State tort laws for this, where does it stop? Is
there no line that you don't cross? I mean, I thought that part
of the ethos of this new Congress was respect for the
Constitution. I mean, this basically tramples on the Tenth
Amendment worse than anything I have seen in awhile. You want
to comment on that, Mr. Wolfman?
Mr. Wolfman. Yes, Mr. Weiner, that--first of all you are
right that the tort system has been traditionally one in which
the State has had plenary authority. And let me just add and I
think that this goes to the point that was asked to me earlier.
What this bill does, it not only trumps the States, but it does
it in entirely a one-way direction. So in other words, what it
does is it is--it pretends that the State system will continue
to exist and it only imposes Federal law when it undermines the
rights----
Mr. Weiner. Right.
Mr. Wolfman [continuing]. Of people who are harmed. And
that is--and let me make one other point. Now it is one thing
to waive around a $96 million punitive--pain and suffering
judgment. There is a big difference between 250,000 and 96
million. That is what we are talking about. We are talking
about the people who have to live for the rest of their lives
with disfigurement, phantom pain, blindness--$250,000?
Mr. Weiner. Well, and then there is the other question that
I think is at the foundation and it is worth having a
conversation here about. Who gets to make the decision? If you
are patient in rural Georgia in Mr. Gingrey's district and you
want a jury of your peers to hear your case or you are a doctor
or you are a hospital and you want a jury of your peers to hear
the case, under this law effect--under this proposal,
effectively that jury is meaningless. If that jury comes to the
conclusion and there are smart people in Georgia. There are
smart people in Mr. Gingrey's district and they hear the
evidence and they draw a certain conclusion, they are now going
to be told that actually it doesn't really matter. That
exercise, your State legislator that passed that law doesn't
matter. The State legislature that approved it and the Governor
that signed it--doesn't matter. That jury that sat--doesn't
matter. The witnesses that were called--doesn't matter. The
victim himself, his or herself doesn't matter as it relates to
Georgia. It only matters as it relates essentially to big
Washington. You are saying it is going to be in the Federal
judicial system. And I would say that it is very hard for
anyone to call themselves small government or respectful of the
Constitution or concerned about states' rights and support the
Gingrey measure. Because what you are really saying is all of
those things we have heard about. Even the Texas law could
theoretically be trumped tomorrow because we can just change
the limit or change a word and suddenly Texas laws are thrown
out. I mean, we have all these law books that are filled with
what people have done. The Code of Virginia--all these
different laws that were passed and now we are going to say
that no, it is Washington that is going to make that decision.
I, for one, find that offensive to the Constitution of the
United States.
Mr. Pitts. The gentleman's time is expired. The Chair
recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana, Dr. Cassidy, for 5
minutes for questions.
Mr. Cassidy. Thank you. I will first by--end up by quoting
or at least summarizing the gist of Mr. Weiner's speech from
yesterday saying that we can't rely on State insurance
commissioners to create standards because otherwise, I think I
remember him saying, somebody in one State will define the
lowest common denominator and there was a basic obligation of
the people who set the kind of rules in which there needs to be
rules of the road. So it seems a little contradictory. That
said, Mr.--Dr. Kachalia, I enjoyed your brief, if you will. I
am a physician so it is--I don't want to insult you by calling
it a brief, no offense to the attorneys. But it was well-
referenced. I like that. I also have here a chapter from a
textbook on healthcare economics. And it is saying stuff that
frankly I find very disturbing. Let us see, less than half of
malpractice insurance premiums, one third of 1 percent of total
healthcare, but less than half of malpractice healthcare
premiums are returned to victims of negligence and the
remainder is spent on overhead and legal fees. So it is less
than half. I mean, the medical loss ratio in PPACA for
insurance companies is 85-15 percent. This is something like 55
going to overhead and 45 not. That is disturbing. It also goes
on to say that there is limited evidence. Mr. Gonzalez
suggested that the purpose as did you, Ms. Doroshow, the
purpose of malpractice is the deter bad physicians, but this
article goes on to say that there is limited evidence that bad
physicians are removed through the malpractice system. Any
comments upon that?
Mr. Kachalia. If I can start, so starting with the overhead
costs I do think that is one of the biggest problems that we
have in our current system with the way the litigation process
works you often have the need for expert testimony on both
sides.
Mr. Cassidy. So just to summarize that is money not going
to victims of malpractice, it is money going to overhead?
Mr. Kachalia. Correct.
Mr. Cassidy. OK. Continue.
Mr. Kachalia. Correct. And so this is one of the problems
that we have noted in the system because there--we advocate it
shows that there is a need for reform in this regard because it
takes way too long and it is much too expensive to adjudicate
claims. So that if we----
Mr. Cassidy. If we have somebody who is a victim of
malpractice, a sponge is left in the belly, then really there
is a length of time before that is adjudicated, the patient
gets relief, begins to get the extra dollars she may need for
her recovery and an ordinate amount is consumed in overhead?
Fair example?
Mr. Kachalia. That can be a fair example although unless
people are starting to settle much more quickly, but if they--
if the provider chooses not to settle, yes, that is a fair
example.
Mr. Cassidy. OK. So Mr. Gonzalez's point that we are
actually using the malpractice system to drive physicians out
who shouldn't be practicing, do you think that is valid? Does
that work?
Mr. Kachalia. I don't remember his exact example but I am
not sure that the medical malpractice system--because we don't
see as many claims as one would expect for the amount of error
that occurs. It may not necessarily be sending the right signal
to all of the providers we want to send it to. I do think that
to some extent it does impact people and does drive some
accountability because people do worry about being sued. And I
do think there is some accountability----
Mr. Cassidy. Now, that accountability though--I am a
physician, so one of the general surgeon says that when he goes
to the emergency room it used to be a history and physical
form. Now it is a history, physical, and CT scan form.
Mr. Kachalia. Right.
Mr. Cassidy. Because folks are so afraid if you come in
with a headache you could have had the headache for 10 years,
you are getting a CT scan. I see Dr. Tippett nodding his head.
I think $1,000 test with lots of radiation, but that way if you
are sued you have got the CT scan. In fact, fair to say it also
drives some of that practice, too.
Mr. Kachalia. I think it is fair to say it drives defensive
practices and also drives accountability at the same time. The
question is which one is being--which one is winning the battle
so to say?
Mr. Cassidy. Now, I also read in this article from an
academic textbook that only 2 percent of negligence victims
file claims, but 6 percent of patients who are not victims of
negligence file claims. That is incredible. Dr.--Mr. Wolfman is
looking kind of surprised. I can find the exact reference and I
can show the chapter. But that apparently people who aren't
victims of negligence 6 percent of the time file malpractice
claims. Dr. Tippett, how would that impact your practice?
Mr. Tippet. Well, it--I mean, you had the perfect example.
You can't get into or out of my office without having an MRI
scan these days and it is not because you need one necessarily
when you come in, but because when we see a patient in the
office we think of a differential diagnosis rather than just to
that one thing like treat a simple back pain for a few weeks to
see if they are going to get better because there is one in a
thousand chance that patient may have a tumor in their spine we
get an MRI scan. That is unnecessary, increasing the cost of
medicine. It doesn't need to be done, but nevertheless it is
exactly what occurs in every ER and every doctor's office in
this country.
Mr. Cassidy. I am sorry. I am out of time. I had a question
for you, Ms. Doroshow and I forgot--one question, Dr. Hollier,
why is it Hollier, not Hollier as in Louisianans?
Ms. Hollier. It is Hollier, sir.
Mr. Cassidy. Thank you very much. I just--warms my heart.
Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks the gentleman. Recognizes
gentlelady from Illinois, Ms. Schakowsky for 5 minutes.
Ms. Schakowsky. Dr. Tippett, you just said that you perform
unnecessary procedures?
Mr. Tippett. That is not what I said.
Ms. Schakowsky. Yes, you used the word unnecessary.
Mr. Tippett. No.
Ms. Schakowsky. We could go back and ask for a reading of
the transcript, but you said that----
Mr. Tippett. Unnecessary at that particular time.
Ms. Schakowsky. Uh-huh.
Mr. Tippett. It is a necessary procedure in the
differential diagnosis that I mentioned earlier, so it is not
unnecessary. It is the question of timing. My point was----
Ms. Schakowsky. But you are saying--now you are saying it
is unnecessary because I want to know if you--when you do that
you order--if you order something that is medically unnecessary
do you also bill Medicare and Medicaid for or private insurance
for this work?
Mr. Tippett. I don't order tests that are unnecessary.
Ms. Schakowsky. Excuse me?
Mr. Tippett. I don't order tests that are unnecessary.
Ms. Schakowsky. Well, OK, you said it was absolutely
unnecessary. I wanted to just----
Mr. Tippett. At that particular time. I am sorry I was
trying to be brief in my comments----
Ms. Schakowsky. Yes, exactly.
Mr. Tippett [continuing]. And I did not add to the----
Ms. Schakowsky. You said no one leaves your office without
getting an MRI because--and the implication was because you
want to avoid litigation. And what I am asking you if you are
billing Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance for these
procedures that you view to be unnecessary.
Mr. Tippett. I didn't say I viewed them to be unnecessary.
Ms. Schakowsky. You did.
Mr. Tippett. I said--no, ma'am, I did not finish the
sentence earlier when I said that test wasn't necessary at that
particular time.
Ms. Schakowsky. No, you didn't. OK.
Mr. Tippett. It is a necessary test to determine whether or
not someone has a tumor was my entire----
Ms. Schakowsky. Yes, I actually wanted to start what I was
saying until I heard that disturbing sentence--those disturbing
remarks that actually I think there might be a way that we
could be on the same side with doctors. This is not a war
between doctors and lawyers. This is about people that get
hurt. Now what--it is so interesting to me that injured
patients become the focus. And we are going to take it out on
them rather than looking at the insurance companies. And why it
is that you who have maybe never been sued and doctors, the
small number who actually may engage in dangerous behavior that
causes patients to be injured, why you are asked to pay the
similar insurance? I--there is--it doesn't-- I don't believe
there is experience rating in medical malpractice insurance. Is
that true, Ms. Doroshow?
Ms. Doroshow. Right, it is rated by specialty primarily
now.
Ms. Schakowsky. You know which really, I think is unfair.
All of us want to see that obstetrician gynecologist, and
neurosurgeons are able to practice where they want to practice
without and without any distinction from the bad actors that
are in those professions. And we all admit that there have to
be those. So what I wanted to ask Mr. Wolfman or Ms. Doroshow,
will capping damages, that is actually making sure that the
real victims lead to lower rates?
Ms. Doroshow. Well, if history is any guide at all, it
absolutely won't. You look at State after State. Missouri for
example, Maryland both had severe caps in the mid-80s. They
experienced very severe insurance crises in the early part of
the 2000s. Missouri's rates went up 121 percent. This is true
in every State. Ohio passed caps. The insurers immediately went
in; asked for rate hikes. Oklahoma the same thing. Mississippi
the same thing. In Texas they would be--after 2003 the cap
passed. The insurers immediately went in for rate hikes. Until
the market stabilizes and it happens everywhere in the country
irrespective of a State's tort law. States will--rates will
continue to go up. That is an insurance problem that needs to
be fixed.
Ms. Schakowsky. Exactly and I think that we are absolutely
looking in the wrong direction and if we want to help doctors
to be able to in their view afford to practice where they want
to practice, to say to people whose lives have been permanently
altered that the burden is now going to be on you. And by the
way, $250,000 which was a number decided in California years
and years ago would be a million dollars now. So we are not
even talking about a situation where we are going to be able to
people--to have people restore their lives. I think if we could
work together on figure--on pointing our finger in the right
direction that this is an insurance problem--it has already
been stated that most people, and you stated it yourself, Dr.
Kachalia, that not as many injured people actually file claims.
A very small percent do because you know it is laborious, it is
expensive, it is hard to do.
Mr. Kachalia. It is not as if you want me to comment, but I
do think there is a premium problem, but there is also the
issue of the emotional cost of a suit that gets attached and
the behaviors that result from it. So it is not just all about
premiums.
Ms. Schakowsky. Well, there is a lot of emotion attached to
having the wrong breast removed or yes. Um-hum.
Mr. Pitts. The gentlelady's time has expired. Chair now
recognizes my colleague from Pennsylvania Dr. Murphy for 5
minutes.
Mr. Murphy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A few questions here.
First, Mr. Wolfman, I am trying to understand this--how this
works. Is there a correlation between unlimited noneconomic
damages and unlimited punitive damages in improvement in
healthcare?
Mr. Wolfman. I think the answer to that is yes with one
caveat. I mean, that----
Mr. Murphy. Do--was there a study that you could refer us
to? I would have actually looked to see that. I am not looking
for you to--I am not going to put you on the spot with a guess.
Mr. Murphy. There are. There are some famous studies on
punitive damages that show some relationship. I just--with the
word unlimited, but yes and I can get those to the committee.
Mr. Murphy. I mean, I am not talking about a single award
that is given in a case, but I mean overall?
Mr. Wolfman. Yes, yes.
Mr. Murphy. You think you can do that for us? Thank you. So
in other words feel that when we have the ability for higher
damages or punitive damages not economic damages we could--
expect to see overall improvement in healthcare driven by that
factor separate from other things?
Mr. Wolfman. As I understand what you are saying I think
the answer is yes and I can get that to the committee.
Mr. Murphy. OK. Now, is there also a correlation then
between the more an attorney gets paid and an improvement in
healthcare?
Mr. Wolfman. I think the answer to that is yes and no and I
think it is not an easy answer that what I--the point I was
making about lawyer compensation through our contingent fee
system is that if you have rates that are driven by the
Congress of the United States that are way below the market
which is what this bill does you are not going to attract
lawyers to take important difficult cases. You are not going to
get the best lawyers on the most difficult cases particularly
the cases for instance older people who have no wage income,
people whose income so to speak would decide----
Mr. Murphy. And the attorney wouldn't have the money to
really advance this case. I understand that point.
Mr. Wolfman. Right, that is the problem. So it----
Mr. Murphy. You have a delay--this goes back----
Mr. Wolfman. Your correlation that you are talking about
I--with all respect doesn't ask the right question.
Mr. Murphy. Well, I mean----
Mr. Wolfman. The question is whether the market is going to
attract people to take difficult cases.
Mr. Murphy. It is important because then you would have the
justice delayed is justice denied issue. Well, let us talk
about that market. I know in Pennsylvania we have some serious
problems with attracting neurologists and OB-GYNs to the
market. And for some of the physicians here perhaps some of you
can enlighten me on this, but I know when I have seen in States
they list the number of people who have a medical degree or
license in that State. My understanding they will look at all
licenses including the residents and interns, semi-retired
physicians and even those who may still have a license in
Pennsylvania but have moved down to South Carolina or somewhere
else to retire in. Is that correct? Can anybody--I see some
heads nod that is correct.
Mr. Tippett. That is correct.
Mr. Murphy. I also hear from some top medical schools--I am
on the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine. I should disclose that--the Department of Pediatrics.
And one of the things I hear from some other departments is for
example, they will have an entire class year after year of
graduates from a top level residency program in OB-GYN and not
a single one of those residents remains in Pennsylvania. So I
go to this question then if we don't have OB-GYNs and I have
friends of mine who are neurologist say they have spent years
trying to attract a neurologist to join their practice. I have
some neurologists here in front of us. If you don't have enough
people to treat patients, what does that do in terms of
delaying care? Anybody answer that for me or enough OB-GYNs in
a practice to delay--does that affect care?
Ms. Hollier. Absolutely. If you don't have available
obstetrician gynecologists care is definitely affected. Imagine
being 9 months pregnant in Blanco County that had no
obstetricians prior to the passing of----
Mr. Murphy. And why don't they want to stay in that State?
Ms. Hollier. OB-GYN doctors do want to stay in the State of
Texas.
Mr. Murphy. But what are--is the cost of medical liability
insurance part of that overall concern in one State versus
another and they can leave and go to another State?
Now I go back to Mr. Wolfman's comment at the crux of not
going forward with H.R. 5 as you affect the marketplace. So I
ask the physicians, does this affect the marketplace to not
deal with this issue? Dr. Tippett?
Mr. Tippett. Well, absolutely.
Mr. Murphy. Dr. Kachalia, does that affect the marketplace?
Mr. Kachalia. I mean I will reiterate. I think we need
reform. It is going to help the marketplace.
Mr. Murphy. Ms. Doroshow, you have a comment you want to
make?
Ms. Doroshow. Well, you know Michelle Mello from Harvard
actually did a study of Pennsylvania doctors and compared
access to care in Pennsylvania before and after the most recent
liability insurance crisis when rates went up.
Mr. Murphy. Um-hum.
Ms. Doroshow. And found there is no connection whatsoever.
Mr. Murphy. Between amount of physicians?
Ms. Doroshow. It is in my----
Mr. Murphy. Yes, I appreciate that. I was a State Senator
at the time and that is why I was saying that point before.
Ms. Doroshow. You should take a look at that study.
Mr. Murphy. If they count the number of physicians
available in Pennsylvania, look at all licenses and that is a
distorted statistic. I just want information, the truth, and it
is--but I appreciate and Mr. Wolfman if you could get me those
studies I would really be grateful. Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks the gentleman and now recognizes
the Ranking Member Emeritus, Distinguished Gentleman from
Michigan, Mr. Dingell for 5 minutes for questions.
Mr. Dingell. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your courtesy.
Professor Wolfman, you described in your testimony the sad
story of Diana Levine who lost her arm as a result of an
inadequate labeled drug. Here is a case of noneconomic damages
and it is--we find it quite overwhelming. The lady in question
was a musician by trade. Without her arm it is doubtful she
will ever be able to return to her profession. She found as you
indicated a small town Vermont lawyer who took the manufacturer
all the way to the Supreme Court. In fact, I was one of those
who joined a number of my colleagues in signing an amicus
curiae Brief in support of the Levine case. I find it haunting
as her lawyer hesitatingly admitted that her case might never
have brought to court had a $250,000 noneconomic damages cap
been in place. Obviously it isn't every day that cases are
taken all the way to the Supreme Court, and I hope it isn't
every day that people suffer the kind of loss that she
suffered.
Now, Professor Wolfman, can you provide some other examples
of the types of cases that you have seen dealing with FDA
approved drugs and medical devices?
Mr. Wolfman. Yes, I can, Representative Dingell, and what I
would like to do is if I could direct your attention to my
testimony and I will just--I know the time is short, so but
beginning at page 12 of my testimony I talk about a number of
other examples and one that I think is similar to the problem
of Ms. Levine is the case of Karen Bartlett. She took an anti-
inflammatory drug and these were in the same family of drugs as
cause terrible problems and were taken off the market, the
NSAID drugs. She ended up having all these complications
including blindness. I think it is just awful and it is
described in some detail, page 14 of my testimony. But the
defense put up by the company was--required 50 pretrial
motions, 50 motions during trial. She had to hire four expert
witnesses, a pharmacologist, a burn surgeon, economist, a life
care planner and then there was another 50 post trial motions
after the verdict came in. Now, no rational lawyer could take
that case given the enormous amount of noneconomic damages.
Mr. Dingell. First off the preparing of the Briefs and the
appearing of the filing of the papers and paying witness fees
and a wide array of other things, the cost of that had to be
astronomical.
Mr. Wolfman. Right. And so--and yes she got a significant
noneconomic damage award, $16 million, but she is going to live
blind her whole life. But the point is is that no rational
lawyer knew the result going in, no rational lawyer would take
that meritorious case if the limit was $250,000. It is very--it
is much easier to attack these kind of awards after the fact
and that is the economic problem, the economic problem in
looking at it from an after the fact perspective.
Mr. Dingell. Thank you very much. Now, Dr. Kachalia, you
work as a physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard
Medical School. I am interested in your perspective on this
legislation. Does capping of liability of pharmaceutical
companies protect physicians from lawsuits?
Mr. Kachalia. So, the question is in regard to how I feel
about the capping with the?
Mr. Dingell. Yes, does it--does capping of the liability
protect you from lawsuits? Yes or no.
Mr. Kachalia. Well, if you look at the data here, it seems
that the capping liability does not seem to lower the number of
claims, so it may not protect us from lawsuits.
Mr. Dingell. Just--I have limited time. Yes or no?
Mr. Kachalia. No.
Mr. Dingell. All right, it seems that making drug companies
less responsible would not help doctors. With--is it your
opinion that this would interfere with your deciding what
medication is best for your patient? Yes or no?
Mr. Kachalia. Is my question what--I am sorry. Could you
repeat the question one more time?
Mr. Dingell. Well, it may-it is my view that capping of
these risks may actually encourage drug companies to withhold
safety data that you could use to best determine what
medication is necessary for your patient. Is that a correct
assumption on my part or not?
Mr. Kachalia. I mean it is a possibility any time you cap a
company's liability.
Mr. Dingell. Thank you. Thank you. Now, well, thank you. I
notice my time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks gentleman. The chair will now
recognize the Vice-Chair of the Full Committee, gentlewoman
from North Carolina Mrs. Myrick for 5 minutes.
Mrs. Myrick. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask a
question to Doctors Tippett and Hollier. Is that correct? Can
you speak to the savings to the overall system that would
result if a national medical liability law like H.R. 5 went
into effect? And I ask that because there have been estimates
that defensive medicine costs our Nation up to 200 billion a
year. And according to the Congressional Budget Office's recent
publication Reducing the Deficit Spending and Revenue Options,
comprehensive medical liability reform would reduce the budget
deficit by $62 billion over 10 years. Dr. Tippett, you want to?
Mr. Tippett. Well, I think that--I think that figure tells
us that it is difficult to quantitate the exact amount. And I
can only speak to my own personal knowledge. I see it happen
every day in which tests are ordered that as I said earlier if
given proper time if you weren't forced to do so because of
your fears that someday if you didn't think of every possible
diagnosis you wouldn't have ordered that test. But maybe I see
patients all the time that I am trying to operate on and they
have to have a cardiology clearance when everybody knows they
don't really need a cardiology clearance but it is because of
some mild thing, an EKG. I mean, you could go on and on. There
is a huge cost and I see every day that increases the cost to
you and me and to everyone else who tries to pay but because of
a fear of being sued.
Mrs. Myrick. Dr. Hollier?
Ms. Hollier. Representative Myrick, I think H.R. 5 would
produce important cost savings. What we have seen in Texas
after the passage of liability reform is that a number of
healthcare systems had had significant liability savings and
they have reinvested those savings in new technology, in
patient care, and in patient safety initiatives.
Mrs. Myrick. Do you think the current medical professional
liability system makes you a better or a safer doctor by acting
as an incentive to practice good medicine? Both of you again.
Mr. Tippett. Shall I go first? Well, I think the perfect
example and I have heard over and over today how if you get--
have these lawsuits then it is going to get rid of the bad
doctors in the system. And I think about a pole that we just
did among the leaders of neurosurgery in the United States. One
hundred of our best cream of the cream leadership in
neurosurgery almost all of them academics, 25 percent had been
sued between four and seven times for liability. Twenty-five
percent--does that mean we need to get rid of all of those 25
percent? Are they bad doctors? Well, obviously not. They handle
the complex cases. They take care of the most difficult
patients. It is absurd.
Mrs. Myrick. Yes, that is a challenge in our community, too
with our neurosurgeons in particular when--because it is a
large hospital that does handle very complicated cases and not
just--I mean, nothing is run of the mill when it comes to your
brain and neurology et cetera, but it is a real concern. And we
are seeing people who are--some of my friends who are in their
late, maybe mid-50s and they are telling me over and over again
both in OB-GYN and neurology or neurosurgeons that they are
going to retire and we are losing--we stand a really strong
shot of losing some really good top notch doctors. And doesn't
mean that others will take their place, but they are telling me
that the younger people aren't coming into their professions.
And so there is this you know, what are we going to do to
service the population? And that really is where I am coming
from when I talk about is there a way to bring this under
control so we don't have some of the so called defensive
medicine. I appreciate your time and being here today. Thank
you all. And I yield back.
Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks----
Mr. Burgess. Will you yield?
Mr. Pitts. Go ahead.
Mrs. Myrick. Yes.
Mr. Burgess. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. Ms.
Doroshow, I need to ask you a question about your testimony
about McAllen, Texas. I am aware of Dr. Gandhi's article. I
don't know if you are aware and I apologize for not having it
here, but he has written a subsequent article where he
questions some of his own conclusions on that. But because of
the article that Dr. Gandhi wrote a couple of years ago I went
to McAllen, Texas, and visited with the doctors down there. The
question before me was are doctors in McAllen, Texas over
utilizing in order to overbill Medicare? And I think what Dr.
Gandhi thought--found in his subsequent relook was that it is
the publicly financed systems of medical care, Medicare,
Medicaid, SCHIP which seem to be prone to this type of
difficulty. You rarely see Aetna, Cigna, and United sending
wheelchairs to patients who don't need them. So something about
the precertification process was helpful there. But the other
thing and the reason that medical liability reform was
important in the equation was nobody practiced in McAllen prior
to 2003. The reason there are so many urological procedures
done now in McAllen is they hadn't had a urologist for over a
decade. There was a lot of pathology that had gone undiagnosed
and untreated. So it is not just a simple equation as these
sometimes draw. The President I know ahs made a big deal of
this that Texas proves that medical liability reform does not
bring down costs. I would say those two statements are true,
true, and unrelated. McAllen is a different location because of
some of the problems that were brought because of medical
liability. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will yield back.
Mr. Pitts. Chair thanks the gentleman and recognizes the
gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Whitfield, for 5 minutes for
questions.
Mr. Whitfield. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the
witnesses for being here today. We appreciate your taking time
to discuss this with us. Since I was not here, maybe you have
already covered this and if you have that will be fine, but it
is my understanding that many medical students when they are
looking for their specialty that one of the considerations that
they look at is liability. And we know that a large percentage
of OB-GYN physicians are sued. We know that neurosurgeons are
sued and Dr. Hollier, you responded to that. Would you agree
that that is an issue with--I mean, what I am concerned about
we may be getting in some specialty areas that may have a
shortage in the future perhaps.
Ms. Hollier. It is an important concern. I have been
counseling medical students in conjunction with UT Houston
Medical School for a number of years both before and after the
liability reforms in Texas. Before the reforms, one issue that
always came up in speaking with medical students was their
concern about entering the field of obstetrics because of the
medical liability. They were seeing practicing OB-GYNs having
to close their offices and stop practicing obstetrics at very
young ages and that is not a future that they wanted.
After the medical liability reforms, my counseling sessions
are very different and medical students have a renewed interest
in our specialty preserving the healthcare limit for the
future.
Mr. Whitfield. Dr. Burgess, I would be happy to yield
additional time if you would like it.
Mr. Burgess. And I thank the gentleman for yielding. Dr.
Tippett, you were starting to talk about patient safety a
moment ago and how the impact of medical liability reform may
in fact advance the cause of patient safety and just like you,
I mean, I can recall multiple anecdotes from the past. But one
of the most striking for me was my very first year in Congress.
I wasn't on the Health Subcommittee of Energy and Commerce, I
was on the Transportation Committee, because that is where
doctors go when they come to Congress. And the chairman at that
time was a gentleman from Alaska and one afternoon I found
myself in Nome, Alaska, with the chairman and he had sort of a
Chamber of Commerce luncheon. I was seated at a table of
doctors and they were all excited about the fact that we might
pass medical liability reform in Washington. And I said, so is
it a problem here? They said it is an enormous problem. So I
asked the gentleman sitting next to me what type of medicine do
you practice? He said well, just like you I am an OB-GYN. And
he said we can't get an anesthesiologist up here because of the
problems with medical liability. I said wait a minute, Bubba,
you can't practice OB-GYN without an anesthesiologist. What--
forget an epidural in labor--what do you do if you have to do a
C-section? He said we have to get them on an air ambulance and
get them to Anchorage. I mean, that is 400 miles away, and this
was in the middle of the summer and some of the worst weather I
had ever seen in my life. I got to believe it is worse in the
winter. How is patient safety advanced by putting a mother on
an air ambulance to Anchorage, Alaska, from Nome? I mean, that
is the sort of thing we are talking about. Is that not correct?
Mr. Tippett. Yes, sir, it certainly is. And you can go on
from there. The trauma system in our country is so dependent on
immediate, immediate availability of the critical specialties.
You have seen that in your own body here in the last few months
of what happens when you have the immediate availability of a
neurosurgeon and others to take care of something like a head
injury or a gunshot wound. If that goes away then you lose all
of this. I applaud my dermatology colleagues but they really
can't take care of a blunt gunshot wound to the brain when it
comes in. And when we have medical students who are purely
interested in going to dermatology now it really worries me.
And when you have neurosurgeons who 68 percent of them are not
doing Pediatric neurosurgery anymore it is not because they
don't want to. It is because of the long problems that you have
with statute of limitations and other things with taking care
of child. It is a travesty.
Mr. Burgess. Yes, sir, and you know in Texas right before
we passed the reforms in 2003, the Dallas-Fort Worth area lost
one of its two neurosurgeons because of the renewal for their
liability premium. It was well into six figures. It was a
fantastic amount of money. He said I can't do it. I am not. I
am going to go work, get an academic medical center somewhere.
We had one neurosurgeon. It put the entire trauma system of the
Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex at risk because one guy cannot
cover an area of four million people 24 hours a day, seven days
a week. And we were at risk of losing our trauma designation.
So it--I mean, these are real world--patient safety isn't going
to be advanced if that happens. Is that correct?
Mr. Tippett. That is absolutely correct. I can cite--I mean
half the neurosurgeons in South Florida for example can't
afford to have liability insurance. As we said here today they
are having to self insure. And I talk to neurosurgeon after
neurosurgeon. A young one goes down to Miami to practice and
says I just can't take the emotional stress of not having
liability. I mean you can imagine with the hatchet hanging over
your head every day you just can't take it. And you could go on
and on around the country. We are at great risk not only of
having young people not go into the various specialties, but
also having them limit their practice after they do. We have a
big problem in neurosurgery now with neurosurgeons saying I am
just going to become a spine surgeon. I am not going to take
care of cranial problems. And it is purely because of this and
other issues which we are talking about something to try to do
something to correct that right now.
I keep hearing all of this about we don't have any evidence
and I keep--I am a country neurosurgeon, but it looks to me
like 35 years of experience in California is a pretty good
example of how things work. And I haven't really seen a lot
patient people leave California because they didn't get
$250,000 cap. And I also haven't seen plaintiffs' attorneys go
away in California in the last 35 years. They all seem to be
doing pretty well.
Mr. Pitts. The gentleman's time is expired. Chair
recognizes gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Lance for 5 minutes.
Mr. Lance. Thank you very much. Let me just say that in New
Jersey we really do not have medical malpractice insurance
reform the way it exists in States like California and Texas.
And we have among the highest health insurance costs in the
nation. In some surveys we are really at the top which is of
course extremely expensive for everyone--our residents and the
business community. And this is an issue of great importance
and I support what we are trying to do here. And I know that
Dr. Burgess has other questions and Mr. Chairman, I would ask
that my term-time be given to Dr. Burgess.
Mr. Burgess. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr.
Wolfman, you cite some rather dramatic examples in your
testimony. I got to tell you administration of Phenergan
entering a course of a therapeutic event is something I saw I
don't know how many tens of thousands of times during my
professional career. True enough there can be a rare but severe
reaction which is what you mentioned in your papers. Stephens-
Johnsons syndrome, a fixed drug eruption doesn't happen very
often. When it does it is so dramatic you will never forget it.
Is it possible to construct a system to help people who are
harmed by the extremely rare outliers and not punish everyone
else along the way?
Mr. Wolfman. I don't know the answer to, you know,
everything that you might do to construct a person--perfect
health care system with a perfect set of incentives, but let me
just say this. Going back to the Phenergan issue, no question
Phenergan is used, you know frequently. It was the method of
administration that wasn't warned against. The company had
evidence----
Mr. Burgess. But to be fair there and we have another OB-
GYN on the panel. I mean, I cannot tell you how many times I
ordered the administration of Demerol and Phenergan
intravenously for someone who was in pain.
Mr. Wolfman. Well, the FDA says it is not a good idea and
the--one of the competitors of Wyeth said it was not--shouldn't
be done, either. But I--the point is, is that these cases--I
tried to be fair in my testimony. I put out five examples. You
could use many others. Two of them went to defendants'
verdicts. You know, the point was that these were all cases
that were, you know, reasonable cases to the ball--all cases in
the ballpark. None of those cases would have been brought if
there was a $250,000 cap.
Mr. Burgess. But it was reasonable not to bring a case, but
these are cases that represented the extremes of incidents in
medical practice.
Mr. Wolfman. Right.
Mr. Burgess. Should we be legislating to the extreme? Is
that the type of--is that the type of system that will yield
the best, most cost effective result?
Mr. Wolfman. Well, I think the--again there is two
questions there. One is, are you creating the proper incentives
for the physicians? Also are you properly compensating the
victim of the problem? I don't agree and we could be here all
day saying that these were extreme situations. I think in these
instances, for instance in Ms. Levine's situation you had a
potentially very, very serious side effect that was greatly
augmented by the way it was administered and she came into the
hospital with a headache. So the risk benefit wasn't
appropriately calculated in that situation because the company
failed to warn about the method of administration.
Mr. Burgess. Let me just interrupt you a second to
Hollier--do you still give Demerol and Phenergan to women in
labor?
Ms. Hollier. Yes, sir.
Mr. Burgess. And is it sometimes administered through an
IV?
Ms. Hollier. Yes, sir.
Mr. Burgess. OK. I just wanted to make sure I hadn't
missed----
Mr. Wolfman. No, no, no----
Mr. Burgess. Shouldn't--hadn't missed something in the last
8 years.
Mr. Wolfman. No----
Mr. Burgess. I appreciate the continuing of this case and I
am going to mark that down as one of my----
Mr. Wolfman. With all respect, that--with all respect, that
was the problem. Ms. Levine didn't get it through an IV. The
testimony was clear even from the defendant's witnesses that if
it had been administered through IV it was virtually certain
that she would not have been harmed.
Mr. Burgess. Let me ask you a question because you seem to
have a beef with the Food and Drug Administration. And I will
just tell you right now we are up against a significant problem
in this country. The Food and Drug Administration has gotten so
risk adverse that virtually nothing can get through. We heard
from medical device manufacturers here in one of our other
subcommittees the other day. There is an enormous amount of
human suffering and the potential for curing disease that is
essentially being left on the shelf in the pipeline going to
other countries. Some panel--we have to work together to find a
way to stop this top-heavy, top-down, centralized punitive
activity that is going on at the Food and Drug Administration.
And unfortunately from some of the testimony you provide us
here today I don't see us moving in that direction. We have got
to work past this. These are not people who are bringing
devices to the market that want to harm someone. These are not
companies that are developing spending millions of dollars on
developing new medications to harm someone. They are trying to
alleviate human suffering and cure problems and prevent
problems, and we have made the landscape almost unnavigable for
particularly the small device manufacturers. But I will speak
with the pharmaceutical industry. And thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I will yield back.
Mr. Pitts. Gentleman's time is expired. This has been an
excellent panel. In conclusion I would like to thank all of the
witnesses and the Members that participated in today's hearing.
And I remind Members that they have 10 business days to submit
questions for the record. Members should submit their questions
by the close of business on April 20, and I ask that the
witnesses all agree to respond promptly to these questions.
Thank you again for the excellent testimony, and this
subcommittee is now adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:52 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
