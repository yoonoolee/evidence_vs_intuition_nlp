OMB'S ROLE IN THE DOE LOAN GUARANTEE PROCESS

The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 9:55 a.m., in
room 2123 of the Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Cliff
Stearns (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Members present: Representatives Stearns, Burgess,
Blackburn, Griffith, and DeGette.
Staff present: Carl Anderson, Counsel, Oversight; Jim
Barnette, General Counsel; Sean Bonyun, Deputy Communications
Director; Karen Christian, Counsel, Oversight; Kirby Howard,
Legislative Clerk; Carly McWilliams, Legislative Clerk; Andrew

Director; Tiffany Benjamin, Democratic Investigative Counsel;
Karen Lightfoot, Democratic Communications Director and Senior
Policy Advisor; Ali Neubauer, Democratic Investigator; and Anne
Tindall, Democratic Counsel.
Mr. Stearns. Good morning, everybody. The Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations will convene. Our witness,
obviously, did not show, so what we intend to do is do opening
statements, myself and the ranking member and the ranking
chairman, as well as members on this side, and then we will
recess after that, after we put documents into the record by
unanimous consent.
So I will start with my opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CLIFF STEARNS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

We convene this hearing of the Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigation to investigate OMB's role in the Department
of Energy's loan guarantee process. The Energy Policy Act of
2005 gave the Department of Energy the authority to award loan
guarantees to companies investing in innovative, clean
technologies, or renewable energy projects. Through the
stimulus, Congress appropriated nearly $2.5 billion to pay the
credit subsidy costs for the companies receiving these loan
guarantees. With that funding, the DOE Loan Guarantee Program
took off. So far, DOE has announced loan guarantees for 20
projects totaling over $11 billion in financing.
Solyndra, a California company, was the first recipient of
a DOE loan guarantee. However, since receiving the guarantee,
Solyndra has suffered a number of financial setbacks.
Solyndra's own auditors noted the company's ``recurring
losses'' and ``negative cash flows.'' The company canceled a
planned Initial Public Offering in 2010, and was forced to lay
off employees in November 2010.
DOE announced just last March that it had notified--excuse
me--modified the loan guarantee to extend the repayment period,
and Solyndra's investors injected additional funding into the
company.
Due to the number of problems Solyndra experienced, this
subcommittee began an investigation of the DOE Loan Guarantee
Program and the Solyndra guarantee, in particular. Examining
the Loan Program was an obvious choice for this subcommittee.
This committee is the authorizing committee for DOE and the
Loan Guarantee Program. The Loan Programs Office had received
over $2 billion in funding from the stimulus, and the committee
had yet to conduct any oversight of the program. So, on
February 17, 2011, this committee opened an investigation with
a letter to DOE requesting a briefing and documents. As our
investigation unfolded, we learned that OMB played an important
role in the DOE loan guarantee process. We also became aware of
a White House memorandum sent to President Obama in October
2010, where White House staff discussed certain ``risks''
presented by the loan guarantee program and specifically
discussed OMB's role in reviewing these loans. DOE staff were
not able to shed much light on these issues or on OMB's
processes for reviewing the Solyndra guarantee, so this
committee sent OMB Director Jack Lew a letter on March 14,
2011, requesting a briefing and certain specific documents.
Over three months later, this committee still does not have
all the information or the full picture of OMB's review
processes with respect to Solyndra. At almost every step, OMB
has sought to delay or frustrate this committee's efforts to
move this investigation forward. We did get a briefing, but OMB
staff were able to offer few specifics about OMB's review of
Solyndra's deal. We thought the documents would provide those
details, but OMB has produced only those records that DOE gave
to OMB in the course of the Solyndra review. These documents
reveal nothing about what OMB did with DOE's information, and
OMB so far has failed to produce any of its own reports, any
memorandum, or analyses to demonstrate how it even considered
or weighed the risks presented by the Solyndra deal.
Committee staff then pressed OMB for production of the
requested communications records, hoping these documents would
provide the story of OMB's role over the course of the Solyndra
review. OMB refused to produce these documents, stating (1) in
OMB's opinion, the committee did not need to see these
documents, (2) that they had concerns about the confidentiality
of staff discussions should these documents be made public.
Committee staff attempted to accommodate this second concern by
offering to review these documents in camera, meaning that
committee staff would look over these documents but not take
possession of them unless that review revealed a further need
for the committee to take possession of the documents.
In order to move the investigation forward, I called
today's witness, Deputy Director Jeffrey Zients, 3 weeks ago to
see if we could reach an agreement about production of these
communications. During our conversation, I asked OMB to make
available to committee staff all emails exchanged on Solyndra,
both internally among OMB staff and with the Department of
Energy, for an in camera review. He stated he needed to consult
with OMB's counsel. One day later, OMB staff called back to
schedule the agreed-upon in camera review. But, in what I view
as a telling example of OMB's overall approach to this
investigation, they did not live up to their end of the
bargain. Instead of producing all communications relating to
Solyndra, as we had discussed, OMB took it upon itself to
select just eight emails that were exchanged between DOE and
OMB in late August 2009, just 1 week before the Solyndra loan
closed. According to OMB staff, they made their own
determination that it was not necessary for this committee to
see any more emails, including OMB's own internal emails. In
their opinion, these eight emails were all the committee needed
to see.
OMB's position demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding
of the Constitutional roles of Congress and the Executive
Branch. It is not OMB's job to direct this investigation and
decide what Congress can and cannot see. This committee has
jurisdiction over the Department of Energy program. OMB plays a
role in approving the credit subsidy costs for over $11 billion
in loan guarantees. Congress appropriated over $2 billion in
taxpayer money to pay these costs. Congress and the taxpayers
have a right to know if OMB is doing a good job of weighing the
risks that are associated with these investments and with these
deals. We know that OMB's role extended beyond the 1-week
period in late August 2009. I had hoped that the Deputy
Director would have viewed this hearing as I do: OMB's last
chance to finally, and fully, answer the committee's questions
about OMB's role in reviewing the Solyndra guarantee and simply
turn over the requested documents that we have sought.
However, they once again have chosen to delay and frustrate
this committee's efforts to resolve this matter. I believe the
time has come for the committee to fulfill its oversight
obligations and responsibility and pursue this information
together and with the ranking member and the Democrats to move
this investigation forward. And ultimately if we can agree, or
not agree, we might move to possibly a subpoena.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Stearns follows:]

Mr. Stearns. And with that, I recognize the ranking member
for her opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANA DEGETTE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO

Ms. DeGette. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think that this
hearing, ``OMB's Role in the DOE Loan Guarantee Process,'' is a
potentially very constructive hearing, and that this committee
could play a real oversight role going forward. The
subcommittee could do a thoughtful review of the material we
have obtained. They could follow the facts where they lead. And
obtaining testimony from OMB officials is a legitimate means of
advancing this effort.
Having said that, I think it is hard to see how an empty-
chair hearing would accomplish anything, and I think it is a
profound waste of everybody's time. Instead of truly examining
OMB's role in the DOE Loan Guarantee Program, we are spending
time on a hearing that will obtain absolutely no new facts for
the record. And this proceeding follows on the heels of public
statements by the chairman this spring, suggesting that the
Loan Guarantee Program involved political favoritism, an
allegation that is completely unsupported by the documents
provided by DOE and OMB, and by interviews the committee has
conducted with relevant parties.
And by the way, given those statements, it is easy to see
why the DOE would be a little bit leery about just unlimited
document productions.
Now, the hearing date today was announced before the
Majority even contacted their witness to ascertain his
availability. In fact, he received his formal invitation to
this hearing just 3-\1/2\ days ago. Mr. Zients, as I understand
it, is perfectly willing to testify, but rather than reschedule
the hearing for one of the dozens of days he is available, the
Majority has called members here to just address their concern
to an empty chair.
Now, he says--Mr. Zients says he is willing to come before
the committee. He couldn't come today, but he is willing to
come in the future. Now, I will also say, the Minority is very
willing to work with the Majority to make sure that appropriate
documents are produced by the witnesses. OMB has a duty to
provide appropriate documents. If they are not providing
appropriate documents, then that needs to happen. We have
agreed, Mr. Chairman, upon a process by which over the next
recess, the next 10 days or so, our staffs will work together
and will work with the OMB to identify and produce the
appropriate documents. If that does not happen, then we will
sit down and talk about further steps, because this is an
appropriate oversight role, and we do look forward to working
with you. But frankly, I think sitting here this morning is a
big waste of time.
And I yield back.
[The prepared statement of Ms. DeGette follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mr. Stearns. I thank the gentlelady.
Ms. DeGette. Mr. Chairman, I also have two letters I would
like to enter for the record. The letter from--are they both
from Mr. Zients? One is from Bill Richardson, the deputy
general counsel, dated June 22, to you, and the other is from
Mr. Zients, dated yesterday. Both these letters express their
willingness to come, and also their willingness to work with
the committee on the documents that would be produced. I ask
unanimous consent to enter those into the record.
Mr. Stearns. Unanimous consent is so ordered, and we had
also an email here by unanimous consent as shown to your staff.
We would like to put that as part of the record.
By unanimous consent, that is part of the record.
[The information follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mr. Stearns. And I would just point out to the gentlelady
that we did invite the deputy director 7 days ago, plenty of
time in advance, according to the rules.
And with that, I recognize for 5 minutes the gentlelady
from Tennessee, Ms. Blackburn.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TENNESSEE

Mrs. Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know that the
bell has rung for votes, and we will soon be heading in that
direction, but I think that as we sit here this morning, even
though we will not have our hearing as we had wanted to have,
that we have to remember the words of Reagan, ``trust, but
verify.'' And that is what we are going to do over and over
again as we look at what--the steps that the bureaucracy is
taking. Our constituents are hurting, we have unemployment at
9.1 percent. Underemployment is getting pretty close to the 20
percent range. Small businesses with fewer than 20 employees
face an average regulatory cost of over $10,000 per employee,
due to all of the new federal regulations that have been
hitting them. It seems as if there is no end in sight on those.
And if that is not enough, CBO has stated that our Nation's
debt will overtake our economy by the end of the decade.
This is not a rosy outlook. Now, more than ever, this
committee and OMB have a responsibility. It is a responsibility
to the taxpayers to ensure that every dollar that leaves
Washington, especially through loan guarantees backed by
American taxpayers, are being put through the highest levels of
oversight and accountability.
As we examine OMB's role in the Loan Guarantee Process
today, one loan in particular that we all were looking forward
to discussing is the $535 million loan guarantee to Solyndra in
September '09 to build a solar panel manufacturing facility. I
thought it was interesting 6 months after the loan guarantee
was approved, Solyndra's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers,
stated that the company had suffered recurring losses from
operations, negative cash flow since inception, and has a net
stockholder's deficit that, among other concerns, raised
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern.
My questions would be, did OMB and DOE share any of these
same concerns just 6 months prior to this report? We don't
fully know the answer yet, and we are not going to get it
today. Also, what exactly was OMB's role throughout the loan
guarantee process to Solyndra? And we don't have the answer to
that, either. We don't know, because OMB has yet to produce the
notes, analyses, memoranda, documents that its staff has
created in response to a Solyndra review.
I hope that OMB will change their position and be willing
to work with us on this issue. Our constituents want some
answers. We need to have answers to these questions. You know,
Mr. Chairman, much of it is due to the fact we are hearing
today that the President now is wanting to do a half-billion-
dollar technology fund to do similar things. Congress shouldn't
be--the President and the administration shouldn't be choosing
winners and losers, and we need to be diligent in our
oversight.
I yield to the gentleman from Texas.
[The prepared statement of Mrs. Blackburn follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mr. Stearns. Ms. Blackburn yields to the gentleman from
Texas.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS, A REPRESENTATIVE
IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS

Mr. Burgess. I thank the gentlelady for yielding.
So we are here today in the Oversight and Investigations
Subcommittee to get information on how funds from the so-called
stimulus package from 2009 have been used. This investigation--
this type of investigation is historically what this
subcommittee has done best, but we find ourselves thwarted by
an administration that, once again, is being non-compliant with
the will of the Congress.
Now, shovel-ready is a concept that was thrown around a lot
in 2009, but just over the last few weeks, the President
himself admitted that he wasn't quite sure the definition of
shovel-ready, or maybe he was unsure of the definition of
shovel-ready when the bill was passed. But in any event, what
started as a $787 billion bill turned into $862 billion, and
the fact of the matter is, we have got very little to show for
it.
In the course of conducting our constitutionally mandated
role of oversight, this committee has repeatedly attempted to
work with Office of Management and Budget to review the
documents pertinent to this investigation. Time and again, this
White House has thwarted any sort of sunlight being shown on
how the federal taxpayer money is being spent and how
determinations were made to that end. This is important work,
and this committee must accomplish this. The administration
must recognize that the Legislative Branch is indeed a coequal
branch of government, and the will of the Legislative Branch
must not be thwarted as it has been repeatedly by this
administration on numerous fronts.
I hope the chairman will take this lack of response by the
administration very seriously, and be fully prepared to
exercise all of the authority that this subcommittee has in
order to compel this witness to come and testify before our
subcommittee.
Mr. Chairman, I will yield back the balance of my time.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Burgess follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mrs. Blackburn. Yield back.
Mr. Stearns. I thank the gentleman. I would also ask
unanimous consent to enter the following documents into the
record: the Majority staff's supplemental memorandum regarding
the efforts it has taken to obtain documents from OMB, and 2,
the document binder for the hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
[The information follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mr. Stearns. It is very unfortunate that our witness failed
to show, but we have made every effort to do so. The
subcommittee is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 10:12 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
