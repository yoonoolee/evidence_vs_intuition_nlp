OVERSIGHT HEARING ON CITIZEN AND AGENCY PERSPECTIVES ON THE FEDERAL
LANDS RECREATION ENHANCEMENT ACT

----------

Tuesday, June 18, 2013

U.S. House of Representatives

Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation

Committee on Natural Resources

Washington, D.C.

----------

The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:07 a.m., in
room 1324, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Rob Bishop
[Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Bishop, McClintock, Tipton,
Grijalva, DeFazio, Sablan, Shea-Porter, and Garcia.
Mr. Bishop. Thank you. I didn't mean to interrupt the
mortuary here. The hearing will come to order. The Chair notes
the presence of a quorum. The Subcommittee on the Public Lands
and Environmental Regulations is meeting today to hear the
citizen and agency perspectives on Federal lands and recreation
enhancements.
Under the rules, the opening statements are limited to the
Chairman and Ranking Member. However, I do ask unanimous
consent to include any other Members' opening statement into
the hearing record if submitted to the clerk by close of
business today.
[No response.]
Mr. Bishop. Hearing no objections, so ordered.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. ROB BISHOP, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF UTAH

Mr. Bishop. Last time we covered this particular subject
area was in 2008, and we have a program that is about to expire
in 2014. So the Federal Land Recreation Enhancement Act, which
is called FLREA, because we like to talk in acronyms around
here, expires next year. This program allows agencies of the
Interior Department and Forest Service--some are good, some are
bad, and I will let you decide which of those--to collect fees
for development of facilities that are providing special
services.
So, this agency can suspend the fees without further
appropriations. Most of them stay on the collection site. And
FLREA also authorizes the sale of nationwide permits.
Today we are going to hear from witnesses who represent the
Federal Government who administer FLREA. We are going to hear
from a State Park Director who will illustrate what is done on
the State government level. We also have with us critics of
FLREA, who will talk us through what they see as reforms that
should be enhanced with the program.
As I said, the authorization of this expires in 2014,
December of 2014. But since there are many activities that are
multi-year permits, the sooner that we can renew this act and
make changes to improve the act, the better it will be. There
are several important issues that need to be addressed, like
which agency should charge the fees, what types of fees should
be allowed. What is the oversight mechanism of the fees? Is
there correct pricing of the fees? How should the fee revenue
be used? Do the incentives in the program of fees promote the
best policies that we have, and are there adequate requirements
for transparency and efficiency? These are just some of the
questions this Committee will ask. And I think some of our
witnesses will talk about whether we should have them at all.
With that, though, there are a lot of things that we need
to talk about to be considered before we reauthorize FLREA,
which, in one way or another, has to be reauthorized. And I am
looking forward to this hearing as the opening phase, and
clearly having a better understanding of what this program
does, what it is intended to do, and what it actually can be,
or if it shouldn't be there at all.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Bishop follows:]
Prepared Statement of The Honorable Rob Bishop, Chairman, Subcommittee
on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation
The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLUH-REE-AH, in
government-speak) expires next year.
This program authorizes the National Park Service, the Fish and
Wildlife Service, BLM, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Forest
Service to charge and collect fees at developed recreation facilities
on Federal lands and waters when special services are provided.
National Parks can charge an entrance fee, BLM and the Forest Service
cannot.
The agencies can spend the revenue from fees without further
appropriation, with most of the money retained at the collection site.
FLREA also authorizes the sale of nation-wide passes.
Today we will hear from witnesses who represent the Federal
agencies that administer FLREA and from a State park director regarding
recreation fees from the perspective of State government.
FLREA has its critics as well and we will hear from three
thoughtful advocates for reform of the program.
The authorization for FLREA expires in December of 2014, but
because some of the activities allowed under the act are multi-year, it
is best for us to act well before the expiration date. Before we extend
the program, however, we need to see what we can learn from the
successes and failures of the current program.
Several important issues still need to be addressed.

Which agencies should charge fees?
What types of fees should be allowed?
What is the correct pricing of fees?
How should fee revenue be used?

Do the incentives in the program promote the best policies, and are
there adequate requirements for transparency and efficiency?
These are just a few of the questions this Subcommittee will need
to consider as part of any FLREA extension.
Let us then begin the hearing. I look forward to hearing from
today's witnesses.
