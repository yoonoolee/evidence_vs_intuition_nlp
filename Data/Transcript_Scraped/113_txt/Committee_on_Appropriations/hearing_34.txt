CHAIRMAN CULBERSON OPENING STATEMENT

Mr. CULBERSON. Good morning. I want to welcome everyone here to
today's hearing on military quality of life for our servicemembers.
Really one of the most important things that we do is to ensure the
peace of mind of our men and women in uni�form. It is an extraordinary
privilege for me to serve as chairman of this Committee, but I really
feel like a Co-Chairman because this Committee is--there are no party
labels or distinctions; we are all here on behalf of our constituents
to do everything we can to support our men and women in uniform.
What a privilege it is for me to serve with our Co-Chairman, Sanford
Bishop, and the work that he has done over the years on this
subcommittee has been a great asset to me, as I still sort of feel like
the new kid on the block here, with this immense responsibility we have
to look after the men and women in uniform.
And, Sanford, you have been a great role model to me and a great,
tremendous help as we have worked together over the last several years
on this Committee.
Delighted to have David Price of North Carolina working with us, as
well, with his experience and knowledge of the issues that involve
quality of life for our military.
I also want to welcome our new members of the subcommittee:
Congressman David Valadao of California, and Congresswoman Martha Roby
of Alabama. Congressman Valadao represents the 21st district of
California, an agricultural area, and we are looking forward to helping
him do everything we can to make sure they get plenty of water in his
part of the country.
So we know how vital that is to the economy in your area, and also
vital to the rest of us in the country when we go shopping.
