HEARING ADVISORY

FROM THE
COMMITTEE
ON WAYS
AND
MEANS

Chairman Johnson Announces Hearing on

the President's and Other Bipartisan

Entitlement Reform Proposals

B-318 Rayburn House Office Building at 9:30 AM

Washington, Apr 11, 2013

Hearing is the First in the Committee's Hearing Series on Entitlement
Reform

U.S. Congressman Sam Johnson (R-TX), Chairman of the House
Committee on Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security, today
announced the first in a series of hearings on the President's and
other bipartisan entitlement reform proposals. This hearing will focus
on using the Chained Consumer Price Index to determine the Social
Security cost-of-living adjustment. This proposal was included in the
President's Fiscal Year 2014 Budget, the report by the National
Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and the report of the
Bipartisan Policy Center's Debt Reduction Task Force. The hearing will
take place on Thursday, April 18, 2013, in B-318 Rayburn House Office
Building, beginning at 9:30 a.m.

In view of the limited time available to hear witnesses, oral
testimony at this hearing will be from invited witnesses only. However,
any individual or organization not scheduled for an oral appearance may
submit a written statement for consideration by the Subcommittee and
for inclusion in the printed record of the hearing.

BACKGROUND:

Social Security beneficiaries receive an increase in their
benefits, known as the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), each year
there is inflation. Prior to 1972, Congress enacted increases in Social
Security benefits on an ad hoc basis. The Social Security Amendments of
1972 (P.L. 92-603) established an automatic process for determining
whether a COLA would be provided beginning in 1975.

The Social Security COLA is based on the percentage change in a
measure of inflation known as the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage
Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The percentage change is measured
by comparing the highest third calendar quarter average CPI-W
previously recorded to the average CPI-W for the third calendar quarter
of the current year. The COLA becomes effective in December of the
current year and is payable in January of the following year. If there
is no percentage increase in the CPI-W between the measuring periods,
no COLA is payable, as happened in 2009 and 2010. In 1975, the CPI-W
was the only inflation measure produced by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS). Since then, other indices have been developed by the
BLS.

In December 1996, a Senate-appointed commission to study the CPI,
chaired by Michael J. Boskin, Ph.D. (the Boskin Commission) found that
both the CPI-W and the later developed Consumer Price Index for All
Urban Consumers (CPI-U) overstated inflation in a number of ways. The
BLS modified the indices to respond to a number of the Commission's
recommendations regarding how these two indices were measured, but did
not address their inability to account for the fact that as prices
change, consumers will adjust their spending habits across categories
of goods (e.g., if the price of beef goes up, consumers might buy pork
instead).

In 2002, BLS introduced the Chained Consumer Price Index for All
Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U), which accounts for consumer substitution
between CPI item categories, as well. According to the 2003 BLS report,
Introducing the Chained Consumer Price Index, the C-CPI-U is ``designed
to be a closer approximation to a `cost of living' index than existing
BLS measures.'' This index cannot be used to deter

[[Page 3]]

mine Federal program adjustments unless Congress passes, and the
President signs, legislation permitting the change.

In announcing the hearing, Social Security Subcommittee Chairman
Sam Johnson (R-TX) said, ``Americans deserve action to protect and
preserve Social Security, and the inclusion of Chained CPI in the
President's budget is a welcome acknowledgement that we must take
action to shore up the program for future generations. Since 2010,
Social Security has been paying more in benefits than it receives in
revenue. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the cash flow
deficit for the 10-year period ending 2023 is projected to reach $1.3
trillion. Beginning in 2033, Social Security will be unable to pay full
benefits, according to the Social Security Board of Trustees. In other
words, when today's 47-year-old workers reach their full retirement age
in 2033, they and everyone else already receiving benefits face a 25
percent benefit cut unless Congress does its job and steps in to fix
this problem. The President likes to say that if we agree on a policy,
then we should act and not let our differences hold us up, and I agree.
This hearing will include a full discussion of a policy with bipartisan
support--more accurately measuring inflation in order to strengthen the
Social Security program.''

FOCUS OF THE HEARING:

The hearing will examine proposals by the President and bipartisan
groups to more accurately measure inflation.

Chairman JOHNSON. Good morning. Thank you all for being
here. This is the first in the Committee's hearing series on
the President's and other bipartisan entitlement reform
proposals.
We need to protect and preserve Social Security. That is
what this Committee is all about.
According to the Social Security Board of Trustees,
beginning in 2033, Social Security will be unable to pay full
benefits. In other words, when today's 47 year old workers
reach full retirement age in 2033 and everyone else is already
receiving benefits, they will face a 25 percent benefit cut
unless Congress reforms Social Security, which we can do.
The inclusion of using a more accurate measure of inflation
in President Obama's budget is a welcome acknowledgement that
we must take action to make sure that Social Security is there
for our future generations.
The purpose of this hearing is to have a full discussion of
a policy with wide bipartisan support, more accurately
measuring inflation in order to fix the Social Security system.
Congress passed the first benefit increase in 1950, later
increased benefits ten other times before passing a law in 1972
that created a formula to determine the cost of living
adjustments or COLAs.
The Social Security COLA increases benefits each year that
there is inflation. If there is no inflation, there are not any
COLAs, as was the case in 2009 and 2010. If prices fall,
benefits cannot be reduced.
At the time automatic COLAs were enacted, the Bureau of
Labor Statistics or BLS only produced one measure of inflation,
which remains the inflation measure used to determine Social
Security COLAs today.
However, BLS has since developed other measures including
the Chained Consumer Price Index or Chained CPI, which we will
discuss today.
The President's own budget says most economists agree that
the Chained CPI provides a more accurate measure of the average
change to the cost of living than the standard CPI.
In testifying before the full Ways and Means Committee last
week, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew stated ``The Chained CPI is
a more accurate measure of inflation in that it does a better
job of reflecting the substitution of goods in response to
relative price changes.''
Today we will hear from the Commissioner of BLS why that
is. Some say using the Chained CPI to measure inflation would
result in a benefit cut, but that is plainly false.

[[Page 5]]

The truth is that benefits will continue to grow, only more
slowly than under the current less accurate measure. Only in
Washington would that be called a ``benefit cut.''
That said, I fully recognize and am sensitive to the impact
this change could have on some beneficiaries' pocketbooks,
especially those who receive benefits for a long time.
The fact of the matter is the current measure overstates
inflation and ignores that it is simply unfair to your children
and grandchildren who rightly expect us to make sure Social
Security will be there for them.
Let me be clear. Determining the adequacy of Social
Security benefits especially for those who are most vulnerable
is an important discussion to have, and we will as part of this
hearing series on bipartisan entitlement reforms.
The President likes to say that if we agree on a policy,
then we ought to act and not let our differences hold us up.
We owe it to every American to carry out our responsibility
and carefully examine each bipartisan policy option, and we
will through this hearing series.
Mr. Becerra is not here yet. Without objection, all written
testimony will be made part of the record.
We have one witness panel today. Seated at the table are

testimony?

STATEMENT OF ERICA L. GROSHEN, COMMISSIONER, ACCOMPANIED BY
MICHAEL W. HORRIGAN, ASSOCIATE COMMISSIONER, OFFICE OF PRICES
AND LIVING CONDITIONS, BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS, DEPARTMENT
OF LABOR

Ms. GROSHEN. Good morning. I thank the Subcommittee for
this opportunity to talk about the family of Consumer Price
Indexes published by the BLS.
As you know, we produce some of the nation's most current
and important economic statistics, including the inflation
measures under discussion today.
In doing so, we help policy makers, businesses and
households to make the best decisions for themselves and
others.
I will start by describing the CPI-U. The measurement
objective of all of our CPIs is to estimate changes over time
and the cost to consumers of maintaining the same standard of
living.
How do we construct the CPI-U? We estimate the change in
prices that consumers pay for a market basket of goods and
services in urban areas. This market basket is divided into
item categories, such as uncooked beef steaks.

[[Page 6]]

We collect prices for goods across 211 item categories in
87 urban areas, resulting in over 8,000 unique item area cells.
We collect expenditure weights for each of these cells, such as
steak in Chicago.
The weights represent shares of total consumer expenditures
across all items and areas. The data source for the weights is
our consumer expenditure survey.
With prices and weights in hand, we produce the CPI in two
stages, and understanding these stages is the key to
understanding how our indexes differ.
In stage one, we calculate a CPI-U for each cell. That is
the average change in prices, and for most cells we use a
formula that assumes that consumers actually do substitute
among products within the cell.
In stage two, we combine our indexes across all the cells
to produce a national number. CPI-U uses a formula that assumes
consumers do not substitute across items or areas. That is we
assume they do not adjust their purchases between steak and
chicken in Chicago as prices change.
What is the CPI-W? It aims to estimate price changes for
households that receive more than half of their income from
wage and clerical jobs. The formulas and the prices that we use
in the CPI-W are the same as for the CPI-U. The only difference
is the CPI-W uses consumer expenditure weights that are based
on the wage and clerical group.
What about the experimental CPI-E? Again, we use the same
formulas and the same prices as the CPI-U, but we use
expenditure weights for households with a respondent or spouse
age 62 or older.
Over the past 20 years, while the CPI-U and the CPI-W
increased at an average annual rate of 2.4 percent, the CPI-E
rate was 2.6 percent. This reflects only differences in
expenditure patterns of these populations. For example, older
Americans relatively heavy spending on health care.
We call the CPI-E experimental partly because the
expenditure weights are based on smaller sample sizes, but also
our CPI-U sample may not represent well where the elderly shop,
where they live, what they buy, and the prices they pay. Moving
to an official CPI-E would require a thorough research effort.
Finally, what about the Chained CPI-U? This differs from
the indexes I just talked about in weights and formulas.
Furthermore, we revise it twice before it is final.
Stage one is the same. Stage two uses a superlative index
formula that captures how consumers actually adjust what they
buy as relative prices change.
Because consumers make such adjustments, the growth in the
Chained CPI-U is typically smaller than that for the regular
CPI-U. For the past 12 years ending in December 2011, while the
CPI-U grew at an average annual rate of 2.5 percent, the
Chained CPI-U rate was 2.2 percent.
The other difference is there are lags in reporting the
Chained CPI-U. It takes a long time to collect consumer
expenditure shares and to estimate their weights. The final
Chained CPI-U for March 2013 will be published in February
2015.

[[Page 7]]

To sum up, as part of our continuing efforts to improve
measurements in our dynamic economy, the BLS has created a
Chained CPI-U to gauge the cost of living in a way that
accounts for how consumers substitute among goods when price
changes are not uniform.
I thank you for the opportunity to testify before this
Committee. Dr. Horrigan and I will be happy to answer your
questions.

Chairman JOHNSON. Thank you for your testimony. That is
insightful.
Mr. Becerra, do you still want to make your opening
remarks?
Mr. BECERRA. I can wait until everyone testifies or I can
do it right now.
Chairman JOHNSON. We will delay the rest of you for a
moment and let Mr. Becerra make his opening remarks. Go ahead.
You are recognized.

[[Page 18]]

Mr. BECERRA. I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman. I apologize
to the witnesses that I had to run a little late. Thank you for
being here. We look forward to the rest of your testimony.
I want to just begin by making a quick observation. At a
time when folks are talking about their economic security, this
is perhaps the most important time to make sure we maintain
Social Security because it is for many Americans, not just
seniors--many disabled Americans, working Americans who have
become disabled, to children, widows and widowers, it is their
economic security.
Any time someone says to you Social Security is broke or
bankrupt or causing our deficit, I will say emphatically here
that is contrary to the evidence. In fact, I think I would be
on very safe ground to say anyone who says Social Security is
broke or bankrupt is lying because the facts show just the
opposite.
Let's look at the numbers. I would say to anyone who wants
to contest what I am about to tell you, show me your numbers. I
will show you some numbers and you can see them on this chart.
Social Security currently has about a $2.7 trillion
surplus, and that is because over more than 77 years of taking
in taxes from Americans who have been working and paying into
Social Security, it has brought in in tax contributions over
$14.5 trillion.
It has also earned interest on those trillions that have
been invested into the Trust Fund by tax, paying Americans
about $1.5 trillion.
At the same time, it has only had to spend in benefits, and
a very tiny sliver you see above that red bar, in
administrative costs, because administrative costs are less
than one percent, a total spending of $13.5 trillion.
The math is very simple. More than $2.5 trillion that
Americans have contributed to Social Security through their
taxes that have never been used through 13 recessions, and in
more than 77 years, Social Security has never failed once to
pay benefits on time and in full.
When we discuss Social Security, we should discuss it in
that context of the reality and the truth of what Social
Security is.
When you hear conversations about what should happen to
Social Security and to those earned benefits that Americans
have paid into the system so they could get them when they
retire or should they become disabled or should they happen to
die so their spouse, who is now a widow or widower, or their
children, who are now the children of a deceased parent, have a
chance to survive, those are the folks we should concern
ourselves most with.
Switching to the Chained CPI, the so-called adjustment,
change to the way we calculate the cost of living, the COLA
increase seniors, disabled folks, survivors of an American who
has perished get, is nothing more than a cut to the benefits
that people receive.
The paycheck or the earned check that people receive from
Social Security will decrease. It is a cut. It is a substantial
cut because we know the power of compound interest. With time,
that cut grows in size.
If we are talking about economic security at this time when
our economy is beginning to recover from those devastations of
the 2008 Wall Street crisis, you would think we would want to
provide

[[Page 19]]

people with the greatest economic security and that would be
through their Social Security earned benefits.
The Chained CPI affects not just seniors, disabled,
children or widows, it affects veterans who will see benefits
they have earned cut. It affects any number of folks including
middle income and low income tax paying families who will see
their taxes rise.
The Chained CPI is coming at the worse time for all those
folks who worked very hard and thought they had paid into a
system on a bargain, that it would be there for them because
they paid into it.
Let us remember that a typical American middle income
worker at the age of 65 under the Chained CPI would lose about
$140 of his or her annual benefit if Chained CPI were to become
the law.
By age 75, the annual benefit would be cut by $560. By the
time he or she reaches age 85, the age at which most seniors
tend to depend most on Social Security, the annual benefit
would be cut almost $1,000 a year.
The problem here is that we have to know our facts and we
have to recognize that economic security is perhaps the most
important thing for our parents, our grandparents, our
children, disabled families, and certainly for American working
families.
Mr. Chairman, I am looking forward to hearing the testimony
because there is nothing more important than the security of
Social Security. With that, I will yield back.
Chairman JOHNSON. Yes. You guys need to take what he said
with a grain of salt. Some of that is shading the truth.
Mr BECERRA. Show me the numbers.
Chairman JOHNSON. Easily. We are not going to quit paying
Social Security. Let's face it.
Mr. Kling, welcome aboard. Please proceed.

STATEMENT OF JEFFREY KLING, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR ECONOMIC
ANALYSIS, CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE

Mr. KLING. Thanks for inviting me to testify. As you know,
the Social Security Administration increases recipients'
monthly benefits in most years, for example, the 1.7 percent
COLA that applied to benefits paid in January 2013 was based on
the increase in the Consumer Price Index between 2011 and 2012.
One option for lawmakers would be to link to another
measure of inflation, the Chained CPI. That Index generally
grows more slowly than the traditional CPI does, an average of
about one quarter of a percentage point more slowly per year
over the past decade.
Using the Chained CPI in a variety of Federal programs and
the Tax Code would reduce the deficit by a total of $340
billion over the next ten years if implemented starting in
calendar year 2014, according to estimates by the Congressional
Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.
The President's budget for fiscal year 2014 includes a
related but less comprehensive option that would use the
Chained CPI for Social Security and some other spending
programs, as well as for the tax system.

[[Page 20]]

CBO is currently reviewing that and other proposals in the
President's budget. I will not be discussing those specific
proposals today.
In my remarks this morning, I will focus on the analysis
examining a generic proposal to use the Chained CPI for
indexing COLAs and Social Security starting next year. Such a
policy would not alter the size of people's benefits when they
are first eligible, either now or in the future, but it would
reduce their benefits in subsequent years because of the
reduction in the average COLA relative to current law.
The impact would be greater the longer people received
benefits, that is the more reduced COLAs they experienced.
For example, after a year, the Social Security benefits
paid to a 63 year old who had claimed initial retirement
benefits at age 62 would be about one quarter percent lower on
average if the Chained CPI was used for indexing.
After ten years of COLAs, the effect for a 73 year old
would be 2.5 percent on average. After 30 years of COLAs, the
effect for a 93 year old would be 7.2 percent on average.
According to CBO's analysis, using the Chained CPI for
annual COLAs would reduce outlays for Social Security relative
to CBO's current law baseline by $1.6 billion in 2014. Those
savings would grow each year reaching $24.8 billion in 2023,
and would total $127 billion over the 2014 to 2023 period.
CBO projects that Social Security recipients would face an
average benefit reduction of about $3 per person per month in
2014 and roughly $30 per person per month in 2023.
By 2033, outlays for Social Security would be three percent
lower than they would be under current law or six percent of
gross domestic product rather than 6.2 percent. As a result,
the gap between Social Security's outlays and tax revenues in
that year would shrink by about one-sixth to one percent of
GDP.
According to many analysts, the traditional CPI overstates
increases in the cost of living because it does not fully
account for the fact that consumers generally adjust their
spending patterns as some prices change relative to other
prices, and because of a statistical bias related to the
limited amount of price data that the BLS can collect.
However, using the Chained CPI instead for indexing Social
Security could have disadvantages. The values of that Index
revised over a period of years so the programs would have to be
indexed to a preliminary estimate of the Chained CPI that is
subject to estimation error.
Also, the Chained CPI may understate the growth and the
cost of living for some groups. For instance, some evidence
indicates that the cost of living grows at a faster rate for
the elderly than for younger people in part because of changes
in health care prices which play a disproportionate role in
older people's cost of living.
However, determining the impact of rising health care
prices on the cost of someone's standard living is problematic
because it is difficult to measure the prices that individuals
actually pay and to accurately account for changes in the
quality of health care.
Changing the measure of inflation used for indexing is only
one of many possible modifications to Social Security, if the
Congress

[[Page 21]]

wishes to slow the growth of Federal spending by constraining
outlays for Social Security benefits or to improve the long
term solvency of the program by making changes to its spending
or revenues.
Many other approaches are possible, a number of which CBO
has analyzed previously.
Thank you.

STATEMENT OF ED LORENZEN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, THE MOMENT OF
TRUTH PROJECT, COMMITTEE FOR A RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL BUDGET

Mr. LORENZEN. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Becerra, Members
of the Subcommittee, it is an honor to be before you and an
unusual experience to be on this side of the table.
I am Executive Director of The Moment of Truth Project,
which was established to continue the work of the National
Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, also known as
the Bowles-Simpson Commission. I worked on the staff of the
Fiscal Commission.
On a personal note, I would like to briefly note that I
have had significant personal experience with the value of the
Social Security program having received survivor's benefits as
a child after the death of my father, and more recently, having
had to manage my family's finances for a period based on Social
Security benefits.
Neither of those experiences have convinced me that
providing COLAs that are greater than the rate of inflation is
the desirable policy, rather, that we should try to find a way
to make the Social Security system fiscally strong by making
progressive changes in the benefits in a way that strengthens
poverty protections for the programs.
The CPI offers a rare opportunity to achieve both
significant savings spread across the entire budgets and by
making a technical improvement to existing policies.
Brief background. The issue of overstatement of inflation
in the CPI gained prominence in 1995 when then Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan mentioned the issue and his belief in
testimony before Congress.
Even before Chairman Greenspan's comments, the
Congressional Budget Office had done a report noting there was
a growing discussion and debate among economists identifying a
bias in CPI.
In response to Chairman Greenspan's comments, the Senate
Finance Committee, chaired by then Senator Pat Moynihan,
appointed the Baskin Commission, which did a review of CPI and
estimated the bias of between 0.7 and 2.0 percent.
While there was controversy over many of the specific
elements and disagreements of the specific findings, the
general consensus was the findings were broadly accepted and
confirmed by subsequent analysis by the Federal Reserve Board
and others.
In response to that discussion, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics did a thorough review of the methodology and made
changes where it felt there were improvements that could be
made, including introduction of the geometric mean to deal with
lower substitution bias and other changes.
Those changes reduced the bias by 0.35 percent, and were
implemented with very little notice or controversy, very
similar to what switching to the Chained CPI would do.
The changes that BLS were able to do administratively did
not address the issue of upper level substitution bias, which
is what Chained CPI is intended to do, as described before.
On the Fiscal Commission, when we started meeting with
various groups for suggestions about ideas for deficit
reduction, switching to the Chained CPI for all parts of the
budget was one

[[Page 42]]

of the common themes of suggestions from groups across the
ideological perspective, and in the Commission meetings, it was
an area of early discussion for potential consensus among
members.
There was definite agreement that it should only be done as
a technical correction and therefore should be applied to all
parts of the budget equally. Interestingly, it was a Democratic
member of the Commission who first raised the idea of Chained
CPI for Social Security, and a Republican member who raised it
on the issue of revenues, both did so on the basis that it
should be done for accuracy.
The final Commission report did include a switch to Chained
CPI, and had some low income protections. It was one of the few
elements that every member of the Commission who voted for the
plan did support.
Since the Commission report has come out, there have been
additional recommendations for improvements for low income
protections, which should be considered.
Switching to the Chained CPI has broad support from the
Congress, across the spectrum, which I have detailed in my
testimony, and has been included in every major bipartisan
proposal.
The budgetary effects have just been described. I would
just note that while most of the focus has been on the impact
it would have on Social Security, Social Security represents
slightly more than a third of the savings while the remaining
two-thirds of savings would come from revenues and changes in
other Government programs.
Switching to Chained CPI would also close approximately
one-fifth of the Social Security funding gap and help avoid the
Trust Fund exhaustion, and therefore, avoid the automatic
reduction in benefits that would occur with Trust Fund
exhaustion.
It is important to remember that under Chained CPI, nominal
benefits would continue to increase. We estimate they would
increase by approximately 60 percent over 20 years under
Chained CPI, instead of a 68 percent increase under the current
measure.
Also, interestingly, real benefits for an 85 year old will
be higher in the future than a similar retiree today.
If you were to compare a worker who retired at age 65 and
is 85 today and took a worker who retired today at age 65 and
received benefits subject to Chained CPI, that future retiree
would still have a higher benefit in real inflation or adjusted
terms by about eight percent higher.
On the distributional effects, both the Tax Policy Center
and the Social Security Administration have found that
switching to Chained CPI is roughly distribution neutral.
However, that does not mean we should not have concerns about
the distributional effects.
However, those should be addressed in the context ideally
of a comprehensive plan where it makes comprehensive reforms of
the Social Security program and tax system to make the Tax Code
and Social Security system more progressive, but absent that,
there are many proposals where you could make much more
targeted, much more effective improvements to provide benefits
for lower income beneficiaries who have been assisted by the
higher Chained CPI

[[Page 43]]

which provides a very blunt and fully targeted way to provide
assistance to those populations.
Chairman JOHNSON. The gentleman's time has expired.
Mr. LORENZEN. Very briefly, moving to the CPI-E would be a
very controversial step. There are many questions and concerns
about the methodology of CPI-E.
I would just conclude by saying that any changes in deficit
reduction are going to require tough choices, but moving to
Chained CPI is not a change in policy, but rather a more
accurate way to implement the current policy and any adverse
effects of implementing current policy more accurately should
be addressed by more targeted and effective policies.

STATEMENT OF NANCY ALTMAN, CO-CHAIR, STRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY
COALITION

Ms. ALTMAN. Thank you. As you know, every January, Social
Security benefits are automatically adjusted for inflation.
Some refer to these adjustments as increases, but they are not.
They are intended to allow those on fixed incomes to remain
in place, to simply tread water, without accurate and timely
inflation adjustments, retirees, people with serious and
permanent disabilities, and others will see their Social
Security erode as they age.
That is no small matter. Half of retirees have total
incomes, that is incomes from all sources, of less than
$17,000. Most of that comes from Social Security. One out of
three seniors relies on Social Security for virtually all of
their income. Nearly one out of two seniors age 80 or over
does. For women and people of color, the reliance is even
greater.
The intent of the adjustment is to allow beneficiaries to
tread water, but they are not, they are sinking. The current
inflation index under measures the inflation they experience.
The Index is designed for workers and the general public,
but seniors and people with disabilities spend more on health
care where prices rise faster and less on clothing, recreation
and other items where prices tend to rise slower.
Chained weighting an Index that already under measures
their inflation simply will sink beneficiaries faster.
By shielding some from the harshest impacts of the Chained
CPI, the Simpson-Bowles, Rivlin-Domenici, and Administration
proposals all implicitly concede that it is less accurate for
this population.
People do not need to be shielded from a more accurate
adjustment.
These protections cannot solve what is a poorly targeted
benefit cut. The Chained CPI cuts the benefits of every single
one of today's 57 million beneficiaries, but people already on
fixed incomes have little or no ability to make up the loss.
In addition, the cost grows with each succeeding year, like
a snowball rolling down a hill, hitting hardest the oldest of
the old, the poor and the near poor.
Members must confront many divisive issues, but Social
Security is not one of them. Poll after poll reveals that
Democrats, Independents, Republicans, Union households, tea
parties, the young, the old, and virtually every other
demographic overwhelmingly agree about Social Security.

[[Page 55]]

They agree that Social Security should not be addressed as
part of a deficit deal to reduce the deficit, and they are
right. Cutting Social Security does not reduce by even a penny
the Federal Government's total debt burden. Cutting it does not
buy the Government a single extra day of borrowing authority.
Let me repeat because many people find this surprising.
Cutting Social Security does not reduce at all the Federal
Government's debt subject to the debt limit.
Including Social Security in a deficit package gives the
appearance that policy makers are raiding Social Security's
contributions and diverting them to unauthorized purposes.
You can easily avoid this improper appearance by addressing
Social Security as it should be addressed, on its own, and in
the sunshine.
That is how it was done in 1977 and 1983, when Social
Security's projected shortfall was much more immediate in 1983,
it was six months versus 20 years today, and much larger, over
eight percent of taxable payroll in 1977 versus less than three
percent today.
Social Security is too complicated and too important to
address any other way, but to do that, policy makers have to be
prepared to follow the will of the people.
This body must open the door to more than just a narrow
group of budget experts, an open process focused solely on
Social Security will not lead to the Chained CPI. Instead, it
will lead, I am confident, to a stronger foundation of economic
security for America's workers and their families.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Blahous, welcome again. Good to see you. Please

STATEMENT OF CHARLES P. BLAHOUS, III, TRUSTEE, SOCIAL SECURITY
AND MEDICARE BOARD OF TRUSTEES

Mr. BLAHOUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member,
all the Members of the Subcommittee. It is an honor as always
to appear before you.

[[Page 66]]

As has been mentioned, I am here to discuss proposals to
apply the Chained CPI to calculation of Social Security COLAs.
In my written testimony, I have provided some background
information about how the COLAs are currently calculated, along
with some basic information about the current state of program
finances.
Because my speaking time is limited, what I would like to
do is gloss over most of that background information and really
just focus on three major points.
The first point, admittedly, at the risk of stating the
obvious, is that whether Chained CPI should be used for Social
Security COLAs is primarily a function of whether you as
lawmakers are persuaded that it is technically meritorious as a
measure of general price inflation.
Obviously, if you were not so persuaded, it would not make
sense to apply it to Social Security.
If you were persuaded, I would argue that it should be
applied to Social Security along with everything else,
including the Federal Income Tax Code, including other Federal
programs. I would not recommend specifically singling out
Social Security for the change nor would I recommend
specifically exempting it.
The second point has to do with the state of program
finances and the impact that the Chained CPI would have upon
them.
Basically, the current Social Security system faces a
substantial financial shortfall that consists of significant
excess of scheduled benefits over projected taxes.
One way or the other, we are going to need legislation to
correct that.
Our best estimates are that if Chained CPI were adopted, it
would reduce that shortfall by between 16 and 20 percent,
depending on the measure that is employed to measure it. That
would be a significant financial step in the right direction,
although one could argue it is modest in the context of the
overall financing shortfall.
A very important factor to bear in mind is that with each
passing year, the shortfall has been growing larger, and
because of that, changes to Chained CPI that improve the
financing situation would actually get us back a little bit
less than to where we were two years ago. It would make up not
fully for the last two years of deterioration in program
finances.
We would still have a very long way to go. I would regard
CPI reform as sort of a broader Government-wide technical
reform on how inflation is measured. I would not regard it as
Social Security reform or entitlement reform or tax reform. The
basic work of comprehensive solvency reform would still be
ahead of us.
The final recommendation I have, and this is a subjective
one, but I believe in it very strongly, which is regardless of
what the Subcommittee concludes with respect to the technical
merits of Chained CPI, I would recommend that we continue to
base Social Security COLAs on measures of general price
inflation affecting America as a whole and population as a
whole.
Occasionally, you read commentary from people suggesting
that we should have sort of a senior specific inflation index
and use that for Social Security COLAs. I would strongly
recommend against

[[Page 67]]

doing that. That approach, I think, would suffer from a number
of disqualifying problems.
One is you have to remember a lot of Social Security
recipients are not elderly. A lot are dependent children. You
have the disabled, 19 percent are disabled, and their
dependents.
Clearly, it would be inappropriate to use an inflation
index for the elderly to index benefits for children or young
disabled.
If you went down the road of trying to have specific
inflation indices for specific sub-populations in Social
Security, we could create real problems and real chaos in a
hurry.
We would have a situation where different components of the
Social Security population would be getting different COLAs,
that can be very divisive. You have to also remember that
people move from one group to the other, when the disabled
reach retirement age, they convert from disability to
retirement benefits.
It would not take very long for people to notice that there
are other disparities in inflation experienced by other sub-
populations, geographic differences, things like that.
I would strongly caution against going down the road of
trying to divvy up the Social Security recipient population
into sub-populations.
I would recommend sticking with the long-standing use of
CPI which is measure for general price inflation affecting the
population as a whole.
In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I would just say again I think
the main point is whether it should be applied for Social
Security COLAs is really a function of the technical merits of
the Chained CPI as a measure of general price inflation.
It would have a positive, modest effect on program
finances, and we would still have in front of us the major work
of Social Security financing reforms.
Thank you.

Chairman JOHNSON. Thank you, sir.
As is customary, for each round of questions, I am going to
limit my time to five minutes and ask my colleagues to also
limit their questioning time to five minutes as well.
Commissioner Groshen, it seems like we have an acronym for
everything here in Washington. Maybe we could think of a new
one today.
For those not so well versed in the inside the Beltway
jargon, what exactly is the ``CPI,'' and is it best called an
``inflation estimator,'' and how does your staff go about
determining it?

[[Page 76]]

Ms. GROSHEN. As I said, we think of it as a way to estimate
the changes over time in the cost to consumer of maintaining
their standard of living.
It really focuses on what it is that consumers buy and
weights it by the experience of consumers. It is an attempt to
measure a cost of living index, and in that way, the Chained
CPI is different from the CPI that we had before, because it
allows for substitutions.
When people can substitute for goods, they experience less
of a decline in their standard of living than when they cannot
substitute among goods, and therefore, the cost to restore them
to their previous standard of living is lower.
It also corrects another technical problem called ``the
small sample bias'' that I can tell you more about if you are
interested.
Chairman JOHNSON. How is Chained CPI different? What does
it mean to call a CPI ``chained?''
Ms. GROSHEN. One of the benefits of having it be chained is
that you can compare the current level of the Index to an
original level very simply. That is where the term ``chained''
comes from. Again, a somewhat technical explanation.
It is really on the difference between the current one that
you have to do a more complicated set of algebra to be able to
get the total difference over time.
Chairman JOHNSON. Do we have to go back to college?
[Laughter.]
Ms. GROSHEN. No, you might need to use your calculator.
That is all.
Chairman JOHNSON. Why is Chained CPI considered the most
accurate measure of inflation?
Ms. GROSHEN. It is considered more accurate because it
allows for this substitution, where consumers substitute. It
does not act as if consumers are more constrained than they
actually are.
Chairman JOHNSON. Dr. Blahous, you are well versed in
Social Security history, and have been here many times. Was not
the original reason for the COLA to ensure benefits keep pace
with inflation? If the current measure is not accurate, do we
not need to switch to a more accurate one?
Mr. BLAHOUS. I would argue yes, and that was the original
intent. The COLAs were basically created in the 1972 Social
Security Amendments, which have kind of a history. There were
some mistakes that were made in the 1972 Amendments, and also
the way it is done today really reflects the state of knowledge
at the time.
Basically they made an effort to adjust benefits for
inflation both for people already receiving them and for
initial retirees. They made some technical errors in the
application of new retirees, and that is what the whole 1977
Amendment set of changes was about, the notch babies, and that
whole story.
They made some mistakes. The reason we are using CPI-W
today for Social Security is not so much because people regard
it as the most accurate measure of inflation, it was just the
only one that was around at the time. Even CPI-U was not around
at the time of the 1972 Amendments.

[[Page 77]]

Over time, the interpretation has been that CPI-W is the
one that has to be applied to Social Security COLAs based on
the old wording of the law.
Ms. ALTMAN. Mr. Chairman, if I can add to that.
Chairman JOHNSON. No, ma'am. I am not asking you the
question. Thank you. My time has practically expired. I am
going to stop now. Mr. Becerra, you are recognized.
Mr. BECERRA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think it is
appropriate to talk about this Chained CPI. I think it is a
very appropriate name for this change in the way you calculate
seniors' benefits.
It really does drag down the ability of those who rely on
Social Security to know their Social Security will be there for
them the way they expect it, they will be chained down.
On the issue, Commissioner Groshen, of the accuracy of the
Chained CPI or the CPI, you also do a calculation called ``CPI-
E,'' which is a calculation of the cost of living for the
elderly. You take a sample of elderly Americans throughout the
country. It is a smaller sample. You do not apply it but you
keep a study that samples elderly Americans when it comes to
what their cost of living is.
In that CPI-E, which calculates cost of living for elderly,
do you notice a difference between the CPI-E and the currently
used CPI?
Ms. GROSHEN. Yes, we do. The difference between the two
measures, the CPI-E and the CPI-U, are the weights, the
consumption weights, differences between the elderly and the
non-elderly.
Mr. BECERRA. What are the actual results? I know I am going
to run out of time. Which ends up providing a higher benefit
amount to an elderly person, the currently used CPI-U or the
CPI-E which takes into account the survey of elderly folks?
Ms. GROSHEN. During the period from December 1982 to
December 2012, the average annualized change for the CPI-W was
2.8 percent, and for the CPI-E, it was 3.1 percent. It was
three-tenths of a percent higher for the CPI-E.
Mr. BECERRA. The CPI-E, which is a calculation of the cost
of living for elderly that you do showed that the elderly have
a cost of living that is higher than the average consumer that
you use to calculate the regular Consumer Price Index.
Now we have the Chained CPI, which would be below the
currently used CPI down here. When people ask is this a more
accurate measure of what the costs of a senior are, there is a
good chance that senior is going to lose way more than what he
or she is currently receiving, which may already be inaccurate
given that seniors probably tend to use health care more than
the average consumer you use to measure your CPI.
I suspect--I am guessing Mr. Kling and Mr. Lorenzen are
probably the youngest folks here. I suspect they have not had
to worry about colonoscopies yet. They probably, being male, do
not worry about mammograms as much.
Once you are a senior, that colonoscopy is something you
have to regularly do. If you are a female, you probably have to
worry about mammograms quite a bit.

[[Page 78]]

If you are young and healthy, you do not have to worry
about that. You might decide if you are running out of money,
you will not buy the steak, you will buy the chicken because it
is less expensive.
I doubt you are going to have a choice when it comes to a
colonoscopy of getting a colonoscopy or a cheaper colonoscopy
somewhere else, or taking your heart medication or buying a
cheaper heart medication.
It is a less flexible calculation for seniors when it comes
to their ability to substitute one product or one service for
another because for them--we would love to have as many choices
in health care, for example, as possible, but they are not
always there.
Ms. Altman, does the change to a Chained CPI, as modest as
it may sound when we speak of it in terms of accountants and .0
this and .0 that, does it have an actual impact on the
resources that most seniors or disabled or survivors of our
deceased American workers have?
Ms. ALTMAN. Absolutely. As I say, it has a snowballing
effect. It compounds over time. The older you get, the larger
the cut. We have calculated that for an average work, retires
at age 65, fortunate enough to live 30 years, even these bump
up's in these various proposals, would still lose a cumulative
amount of about $15,000. That is someone who during their
working years was only earning $40,000.
Mr. BECERRA. It is a hit. Let me just conclude by saying I
thank you all for your testimony. We have to continue to
examine these things.
I think Mr. Blahous said it correctly, we have to here in
Congress decide what we do, and I would simply finally add that
knowing that Social Security has never added a single penny to
our deficits.
I would hope that we confine our discussions about working
on strengthening Social Security to Social Security, not within
the context of budget deficits that Social Security never
caused.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman JOHNSON. Thank you. Mr. Renacci, you are
recognized for five minutes.
Mr. RENACCI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank all
the witnesses today for being here. When I saw this chart in
the beginning, it is interesting, because you try to learn some
things.
Mr. Kling, I want to ask if this statement is true. Since
2010, Social Security has been paying more in benefits than it
receives in revenue and that the cash flow deficit for the ten
year period ending 2023 is projected to reach $1.3 trillion
according to the CBO?
Mr. KLING. Yes, it is correct. The Congressional Budget
Office generally focuses on the budget of the Government as a
whole. On that basis, the dedicated revenue from Social
Security taxes was less than outlays for Social Security
benefits last year, and will be throughout the next decade
under current law, contributing to the unified Federal budget
deficit and increasing Federal debt held by the public.
Looking at just the Social Security program, the total
inflow including payroll tax revenue and interest payments on
the Trust Fund balances from the Treasury will exceed the
outflow from the

[[Page 79]]

combined Old Age Survivors and Disability Insurance Trust Funds
for the next several years.
That situation will reverse and the outflow will exceed the
inflow starting in 2017, CBO projects. That combination of
Trust Funds includes the Disability Insurance Trust Fund that
will be exhausted in 2016.
Mr. RENACCI. Between now and 2023, we will reach $1.3
trillion? That is a true statement?
Mr. KLING. Yes.
Mr. RENACCI. Thank you. Mr. Lorenzen, I think this comes
down to accurate measure. You were ending your testimony about
this is all about coming up with an accurate measure of
inflation.
You did not get a chance to finish. I would like to hear
the rest of what you were going to say.
Mr. LORENZEN. What I was saying is the policy within the
Social Security program, within the Tax Code and many other
programs is to ensure that the value of those benefits or those
provisions in the Tax Code keep pace with inflation.
As long as that is the policy, we should try to implement
that policy in the most accurate way and make sure those
programs are indexed to the most accurate measure of inflation
as possible.
In some cases, providing a higher than justified increase
in inflation masks other shortcoming's in the programs or
provides benefits across the board that benefit certain
populations more so and provide a more accurate measure that
may have other undesirable consequences, but those should be
addressed by policies that are intended to do that.
We should not be having a policy to index programs to
greater than inflation that provides a higher adjustment for
everyone in order to help some.
For example, it makes no sense to have an indexing of the
Tax Code that provides a $450 windfall to someone at the top
quintile of the Tax Code in order to protect a $25 tax benefit
for someone at the bottom quintile.
You would be far better to accurately index inflation for
everyone, and then if we are concerned, as I am about the
person at the bottom quintile, find another change to the Tax
Code to address that.
I think we can do that in Social Security and other
programs, index the programs to achieve the policy goal of
keeping pace with inflation for all of them and then finding
ways to help and assist those for whom that change in inflation
exposes other shortcoming's.
Mr. RENACCI. What do you believe is the most accurate
measurement?
Mr. LORENZEN. I do believe the Chained CPI that has been
developed over years is the most accurate measure based on what
I have read from experts.
Mr. RENACCI. Thank you. Commissioner Groshen, why is CPI-E
referred to as experimental? Is it ready for prime time?
Ms. GROSHEN. The short answer is no, it is not ready for
prime time, which is why we all it experimental. The problems
with it are it is based on a small sample size, but even more
than that, it is

[[Page 80]]

based on using the same stores and the same prices and the same
set of goods as for the general population.
For the BLS to stand behind it as an official statistic, we
would need to do the research involved to really design the
program to measure the cost of living for the elderly in a
statistically sound way.
Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Lorenzen, do you have any comments about
the flaws in the CPI-E?
Mr. LORENZEN. I would add a couple of flaws. I think health
care is one area of different expenditures, but there are other
differences in spending patterns among seniors that are not
reflected in CPI-E, including mail order and senior discounts.
There are also questions about how it accounts for housing
is accurate, that seniors are much more likely to own their own
home and have paid off mortgages, whereas CPI and CPI-E both
assume inflation based on imputed rent.
On the issue of health care, I would say two things. First,
as was noted, it is not clear how much the measures are
accurate in measuring health inflation, that it is very
difficult to do so accurately, and some suggestions that
measures overstated health care inflation.
I would add the bulk--the increase in health care costs for
seniors is in a small population. Instead of again having a
higher inflation adjustment based off the higher health
expenditures for the smallest population, we can address that
through something like an out-of-pocket limit and other reforms
of the Medicare program instead of providing a higher
adjustment for everyone.
Mr. RENACCI. Thank you. I yield back.
Chairman JOHNSON. Thank you. The gentleman's time has
expired.
Ms. Schwartz, you are recognized for five minutes.
Ms. SCHWARTZ. Thank you, I appreciate the testimony. I do
also have to start with where I think our premise has to begin.
I will echo some of the comments made by the Ranking
Member, that we should begin by understanding that Social
Security is different and is funded differently, has its own
Trust Fund, in fact, in the wisdom of Congress, they actually
anticipated the baby boomers, unlike in Medicare, for example,
and that was important. Those are dollars in Social Security
going forward.
We have made a commitment, Social Security to seniors and
to their families, and we ought to start with the premise of
absolutely sustaining it and making sure it's there for our
current seniors and our future seniors.
The discussion about how to modify the CPI, Consumer Price
Index, for Social Security, it feels really different. How it
affects seniors, as I think was pointed out in the panel, the
idea of changing it and already we know it is not going to work
for all seniors.
Therefore, how many seniors are we then going to modify it
for because we are worried about older seniors, the biggest
group that is growing, over 85. The poorest seniors, which is a
lot of them also, and our sickest seniors.
If you are starting to say okay, it does not work for
percent or that percent, we begin to say is this a wise thing
to do. That is really the question before us, should we even be
applying a change

[[Page 81]]

in the Chained CPI or even considering it for seniors and for
Social Security?
That is a big deal. In Pennsylvania, it is a big deal. We
have almost two million seniors. As you know, seniors are
aging.
As already pointed out, they have very different uses of
the economy than you might compare to a 25 or 35 or 45 year
old. They are living on fixed incomes, more and more of them
are relying on Social Security as the one piece they know is
going to come to them.
Small changes in an inflationary factor, I think it becomes
increasingly important as we are seeing changed in retirement
benefits for many Americans, to sort of move from defined
benefits to defined contributions, it may be even more
important as we go forward for future seniors.
Again, you point out that most seniors--I thought the
number was $14,000, average income, you said $17,000. It is
still not very much.
I wanted to really ask the question about how this would
apply to the poorest and sickest seniors. The question was
raised about seniors had a different position in terms of
health care than younger Americans.
I know when I talk to a group of seniors, and I bet if I
say it to everybody in this room, how many of you take a
medication. Forget the ones that are really serious, how many
of you who are over 65 take a medication. They laughed.
I said, ``does anyone take one?'' They all laughed at me.
One. How about two, how about three, how about four. Which one
are you not going to take if you do not get a little more of an
increase.
It is a little different than am I going to buy steak or
chicken. It is really a question of am I going to buy chicken
at all. Am I going to buy vegetables. Am I going to take one
medication versus another.
That is serious business. It has implications for higher
costs for families, who often have to help out their seniors/
relatives, or higher costs to taxpayers because they show up in
emergency rooms.
The implication in relationship to health care costs, which
seems to be very, very important and different for seniors, as
well as some of the issues some others would like to raise
about housing.
These are seniors who live on a fixed income. It is not
easy for them to shift costs to somewhere else, as some do. I
will get a job. I will get a second job. I will find a higher
paying job. I will not buy a new car this year.
This is really not what most 85 year old's or 80 year old's
or even 75 year old's are really thinking about.
We really have to understand that may be very different
than a change we might make or might not make in how we index
increases.
What we hear as Members of Congress all the time is the
increases, and they are small, that they get in Social
Security, often go to the increases in Medicare, cost sharing.
They get pretty upset about it.
It is not even an increase question, about whether they can
afford increases in their heating bill because they have
already used it all up for health care.

[[Page 82]]

I really wanted to ask Ms. Altman if you could just speak
more specifically to how many seniors would have to--I think
Mr. Lorenzen talked about this--be ameliorated. The harm to
seniors would have to be ameliorated in terms of our sickest
seniors, our poorest seniors, our oldest seniors.
Ms. ALTMAN. We have actually looked at that very carefully.
It is really more than half. If you are talking about the
poorest of the poor, you are talking about 9.4 million seniors
who are not getting SSI but just Social Security, but are poor
or near poor.
As you say, the population is aging. More and more are
getting older.
If it is an accurate Index, you do not have to ameliorate.
People talk about shielding veterans, two out of five Social
Security beneficiaries are veterans.
There are lots of groups that I think the American people
would see as deserving and not worthy of having a cut.
Chairman JOHNSON. The gentlelady's time has expired.
Ms. SCHWARTZ. Thank you very much.
Chairman JOHNSON. Mr. Kelly, you are recognized.
Mr. KELLY. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you all for being
here.
There is an old adage where I come from, if you do not know
where you are going, any road will get you there. In this case,
we do know where we are going. We know if we do not take a look
into the future, if we do not get this fixed--I understand
charts and I understand income has nothing to do with solvency.
A lot of people make a lot of money and still go broke every
year.
It is not a matter of how much you make, it is how much you
save. It is about keeping your spending under control.
Listen, I am/ 64. You think I am not concerned about what
is happening? I am absolutely concerned with what is happening.
By the same token, there is something about early detection. If
you get it early enough, you can usually get it fixed and get
it done at much less cost.
I am trying to figure out why even have the hearing today
if there is no problem. We have all kind of revenue. We do not
have any problem looking into the future, why are we worrying
about this? Why are we even having this conversation about the
solvency and the long range stability of Social Security?
If I look at the figures, what are we talking about? We
have all kind of money. All kind of money coming in. It is
growing at a tremendous rate, 1.6%, 1.8%.
Here is the deal. If your heart is willing but your wallet
is weak, I do not care how much you care about these folks, I
care about them.
We made promises to people years ago that we cannot keep
today and then we try to soft soap it and really, I wish policy
were the driving force in this town and not politics.
I wish we could talk about the reality of how we are going
to save this program as opposed to how we are going to spend it
some way that makes us look good in the next election.
If we really care about Americans, I do not care about
Republican, Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, whatever you
are in this country, there is always that ability to speak
about it openly and do it the right way, but do it honestly,
please.

[[Page 83]]

I want to save the program, too. Mr. Blahous, you have some
interesting approaches. Running a business all my life, there
are a lot of things that I made a mistake on early. My dad was
a World War II pilot, and much like the Chairman, he was a
bomber pilot. We had a Cessna franchise for a while.
The most important thing he told me is when we were flying
somewhere. He would say, son, make sure that you chart that the
right way and make sure you stay on course.
It is no big deal being off one degree. I grew up in a
little town called Butler, about 25 miles from Pittsburgh. You
can be off one degree flying from Butler to Pittsburgh and end
up pretty close to Pittsburgh. If we were flying from Butler to
Los Angeles, we would end up in Oregon.
There is a long range effect to this stuff. The equities
that you talked about, if it is not a problem, we have all this
income, if it is coming in and we cannot spend it fast enough
and do not worry about it, why be concerned? Why all the
interest?
If we do not do this, what is the ultimate effect? I like
the approach you have to it. We are talking now about numbers
that support what our hearts want to do.
Mr. BLAHOUS. I think even relative to many other experts, I
am extremely concerned about the financial future of Social
Security.
You made a reference to early detection. I fear the early
detection light has been going off for a while and there has
been a failure to act.
I fear we are actually getting to the point where it is
going to be difficult to get this problem resolved.
In 1983, the program faced a very substantial financing
crisis. It took a tremendous amount of bipartisan cooperation
to resolve it. You actually had Republicans and Democrats
joining together to overcome the very spirited opposition of
the AARP and other seniors groups. It was a very difficult
thing to do.
We had to delay COLAs by six months. They had to raise the
retirement age. They exposed benefits to taxation for the first
time. They had to bring all Federal employees into the system.
They had to accelerate a previously enacted increase in the
payroll taxes.
This was really politically painful stuff. The current long
range shortfall in Social Security relative to that then, it is
about twice as large now. The amount of political pain that all
of you would have to endure in a long range solvency fix is
about twice as much as it was in 1983.
If you did a 50/50 on benefits and taxes, conservatives
would have to agree to twice as much in terms of tax increases
and progressives twice as much in terms of benefit restraints
as was done in 1983.
That is a very tall order. With each passing year, this
becomes a bigger problem to solve. I am very worried about it.
I am worried about the consequences if we do not enact repairs
relatively soon.
Mr. KELLY. Mr. Renacci and I are both automobile dealers.
In the old day, we had gauges that told us what the temperature
was, what the oil pressure was, and they switched the lights.
They would go red. It was called ``idiot lights'' because when
the light was on, it was already too late. The engine was
fired.

[[Page 84]]

You say we have a blinking light right now. It may be
blinking yellow but we better wake up and smell the coffee. We
are at a dangerous, dangerous point.
I thank you for your testimony. Mr. Chairman, my time has
expired.
Chairman JOHNSON. Thank you. Mr. Thompson, you are
recognized for five.
Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to all the
witnesses for being here today.
I am glad you preceded me in the questioning because you
raised an issue that I came into this Committee thinking about
today. It is a little bit confusing as we deal with this.
I think we need to talk about Chained CPI and what it means
and how it works. The idea that we are talking about it from
the vantage that you brought up as part of the shortfall for
Social Security, I find a little bit baffling.
I do not think it is a reform to Social Security. As I
understand it, it is about 20 percent of the shortfall. That is
a long way from what we need to be doing. It is even worse in
this case because to get that 20 percent of the shortfall, you
are cutting benefits to seniors and you are cutting benefits to
veterans, and many times those veterans are the seniors that we
are trying to help provide a secure retirement for.
When we talk about Chained CPI as part of the deficit
issue, I think it really muddies the water. Social Security
does not have anything to do with the debt, as I understand it.
I do not believe Social Security has added a dime to our debt.
I do not believe it can by law.
When you start co-mingling these topics, I do not know if
it gets us to where we need to be. That is we certainly need to
deal with our deficit. We need a long term plan to do it. When
we start doing that, I think we need to look at what caused it.
You cannot have major tax cuts without paying for them. You
cannot go to war without paying for it. You cannot provide
prescription drug benefits without paying for it. Yet, we are
not talking about anything like that.
We also need to make sure that Social Security is available
for providing a secure retirement for many years to come.
As I mentioned, this does not do it. It is 20 percent. I do
not know you factor that in. If you look at the 20 percent and
you are getting that from the seniors themselves, that kind of
raises havoc with the security of those seniors that you are
trying to help.
I have a couple of specific questions. Ms. Altman, can you
explain how Chained CPI cuts veterans' benefits?
Ms. ALTMAN. Sure. The veterans' benefits actually can get
hit three or four times because as you know, there are a number
of programs Government-wide that are indexed, the largest
savings comes from Social Security.
As I said earlier, two out of five veterans receive Social
Security. People who are disabled or die in Service in Iraq or
Afghanistan qualify for Social Security benefits. Those
benefits would be cut by the Chained CPI.
In addition, there are a number of veteran specific
programs, veteran retirement programs and programs for disabled
veterans.

[[Page 85]]

Those also are indexed and those also would be cut by the
Chained CPI.
Mr. THOMPSON. If you are a veteran who was wounded in a
previous war and you get a certain disability payment as a
result of that, you can expect to see your veterans' disability
check reduced?
Ms. ALTMAN. That is right.
Mr. THOMPSON. If you are a veteran who was killed and your
children are receiving benefits, the children of that veteran
can expect to see a reduction in their benefits they receive
from their dead mother or father?
Ms. ALTMAN. They will be cut twice. They also receive
survivor benefits under Social Security.
Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. Blahous, do you still believe we ought to
privatize Social Security?
Mr. BLAHOUS. As you know, I worked for President Bush and
worked on his proposal to include personal accounts of Social
Security. I actually think although at one time, it would have
been prudent to try to save as much Social Security
contributions as we could going forward in personal accounts, I
think that time has passed.
I think it is too late to advance fund a significant
portion of Social Security obligations.
I believe our solutions at this point are best confined to
the traditional ones, trying to align benefits and taxes within
the current structure.
Mr. THOMPSON. You do not believe we should privatize Social
Security?
Mr. BLAHOUS. No.
Mr. THOMPSON. How do you think we should do the reform?
Mr. BLAHOUS. I will give you a two part answer. There is
what I personally would design if I were dictator of the world,
and there is what I would support.
The second ranges much wider than the first one. I would
tend to focus primarily on reductions in the rate of the growth
on the high income end basically by changing the benefit
formula. There are some other changes I would make.
Mr. THOMPSON. Means test it?
Mr. BLAHOUS. No, I would not do a true means test. A means
test basically means measuring income outside the Social
Security system and withholding benefits based on that.
There is a benefit formula in the current law that is
progressive. It is like a system of income tax brackets except
you have benefit brackets. I would basically make those more
progressive and hold down benefit growth on the higher income
end.
Having said that, there have been proposals put forward
that would do more of a mix of revenue changes and benefit
changes like the Simpson-Bowles proposal.
Mr. THOMPSON. Raising the age, is that one?
Mr. BLAHOUS. Raising the age would be something I would
consider as was in Simpson-Bowles. Simpson-Bowles included some
increases in the tax base as well.
I frankly think a solution is important enough that I would
go along with a variety of ways to do it.

[[Page 86]]

Chairman JOHNSON. The gentleman's time has expired. There
are a lot of ways to fix it and we need to and we will.
Mr. Griffin, you are recognized.
Mr. GRIFFIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to start out
by saying that I saw a representative from the White House here
in the room. I want to say something I do not say much, which
is I congratulate the President on acknowledging that we have a
problem.
There are some people here I have heard from today that do
not acknowledge that we have a problem, and the President has
acknowledged that we have a problem.
We may disagree on what to do about it, but it was welcomed
to see him at least putting something forward that starts the
conversation on this.
I will say one of the big problems is the longer we wait,
the closer we get to the edge of the cliff, the fewer options
we have.
We have heard a reference to that here a minute ago. My
mother is on Social Security. I pay into Social Security,
despite what the Internet says. I hope to get Social Security
benefits at some point, especially since I turned down my
congressional pension.
I am counting on Social Security. I want to save it. I feel
like I am in a land of glitter and unicorns here because you
have people who are saying Social Security has a problem, it
does not have enough money, but it does not add to the deficit
or the debt. Complete and utter nonsense.
I am not going to be one of these guys that cites
Factcheck.org, although they have commented on this. Sometimes
they are right and sometimes they are wrong.
The bottom line is we have a yearly deficit. If Social
Security only used the money it has coming in, we would have a
problem. You can say it does not add to the deficit. You can
say it does not add to the debt. You may be thinking of Social
Security as a separate fund and it technically is, but it is
one Government.
Mr. BECERRA. Will the gentleman yield?
Mr. GRIFFIN. The gentleman will not yield. If you take $100
in your personal account and separate it in ten separate
accounts, you still have $100.
The bottom line is because of where we go to get the money
to plus up Social Security, at the end of the day, we are
borrowing money. Where is the money coming from if we are not
borrowing it from somewhere?
This is just ridiculous. I agree with this gentleman, why
are we here if there is not a problem. There is a problem and
that is why we are here. It is that simple.
You can talk Washington speak, about moving money around,
and it is not here, that is a bunch of nonsense to normal
people. You are insulting people when you say we have enough
money.
If you say we do not have enough money, then you have to
admit it is adding to some deficit somewhere even if it is on
another balance sheet.
These ideas of trust funds is Washington speak, we know
they are routinely treated as one big pool of money. Either you
are wasting my time, which I rushed over here from somewhere
else, or we have a problem.

[[Page 87]]

I think the President just acknowledged we have a problem.
I am a veteran. I am still serving. I had to get up early this
morning and run Army Reserves all the way down the Mall. Do not
talk to me about veterans. My grandfather served in World War
I. I served in Iraq.
I want to help veterans. Will they be better off if we have
a debt crisis, folks? How are seniors going to be better if we
have a debt crisis? Ask the Europeans. It is a bunch of
nonsense.
I had a question, but I am out of time. If I hear somebody
else say that we have plenty of money and this is not adding to
the deficit or debt, I just cannot listen to it.
I thank President Obama for starting the conversation so we
can fix this for the next generation of people, which includes
me. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman JOHNSON. Thank you. The President is aware. Mr.
Doggett, you are recognized.
Mr. DOGGETT. Let me just affirm that Social Security is not
adding to the debt to begin with. That does not mean that I am
not concerned about the long term solvency of Social Security
and that it will be there as strong for my grandchildren as it
was for my parents.
Mr. Lorenzen, your group has worked with the
recommendations of the Simpson-Bowles Commission. This is not
the only recommendation that the Simpson-Bowles Commission made
to ensure the long term solvency of Social Security, is it?
Mr. LORENZEN. No, it is not.
Mr. DOGGETT. In fact, one of the other recommendations of
the Simpson-Bowles Commission was that the wage base, the
taxable wage base would be slowly expanded, and did not that
proposal--if the concern is for the solvency, the long term
solvency of Social Security, did not that proposal do more to
protect the long term solvency than adjusting the cost of
living increase?
Mr. LORENZEN. It did somewhat more. It was a comprehensive
plan that looked at all parts.
Mr. DOGGETT. I want to be open to all points of view. My
main objection here, when the President's name is invoked, that
once again, as has happened a number of other times in this
Administration, he begins by saying he agrees with what the
Republicans want, which is clearly a limitation on the growth
of Social Security benefits, and then begs for something in
return.
Of course, they have rejected any other revenues, including
additional revenues to protect the solvency of Social Security,
or closing corporate loopholes, or making the other changes
that would allow us to address our budget shortfall, which is
very real.
Commissioner, let me ask you, with reference to the Chained
CPI, my understanding from your testimony is that even if the
Republicans exerted total control on this and they could impose
it this morning, we are not quite ready yet to do so. It is
not, as you said, ready for prime time yet.
Ms. GROSHEN. What is not ready for prime time is the
Chained CIP-E. The Chained CIP-U is ready.
Mr. DOGGETT. Could be ready.

[[Page 88]]

Ms. GROSHEN. That is right. You would have to deal with the
fact that it is revised twice, but there is a plan out there
that would allow that to happen.
Mr DOGGETT. You have indicated that implementing that takes
longer than the way we do the CPI now, that the data takes
longer to collect and is not as available as quickly as the way
we do it now.
Ms. GROSHEN. No. We publish an initial number and that
could be used to adjust the cost of living, were that the
choice of the policy makers.
The BLS makes no recommendation on how our official numbers
should be used.
Mr. DOGGETT. I guess like so many other members, I receive
so many expressions of concern for seniors during the two years
that they received no cost of living increase of any kind and
the notion that increases in the cost of food at the grocery
store did not decline or stay steady during that time, they
soared.
If we had in effect the cost of living increase that is
being discussed today, the chained approach, how much less over
the last decade or two would seniors have received? Would there
have been other years in which they had no cost of living
increase?
Ms. GROSHEN. We can do that calculation for you. I do not
have that off the top of my head.
Mr. DOGGETT. It would not surprise you taking it say over
the last two decades if they had two recent years in which they
got no cost of living increase, if this new system had been in
place, there would have been other years over that 20 years in
which they also would have received no cost of living increase.
Ms. GROSHEN. Possibly.
Mr. DOGGETT. Ms. Altman, let me ask you also, looking
forward with reference to veterans, and I appreciate the
gentleman's service, I have a lot of veterans in the San
Antonio/San Marcos/Austin area concerned about what impact this
will have on them, just like seniors and individuals with
disabilities.
What difference will it make over time to them in terms of
dollars and cents? What is the estimate?
Ms. ALTMAN. Let me make clear that the American Legion and
the Veterans of Foreign Wars are against the Chained CPI, both
for Social Security and the veterans' programs.
They would have the figures on the overall calculation.
Mr. DOGGETT. You are saying both the VFW and the American
Legion oppose this change?
Ms. ALTMAN. We can give you a list of veterans, Paralyzed
Veterans of America, those are the most prominent groups. There
are about fifteen veterans' groups that have come out against
it. We can provide your staff with the letters they have sent.
Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you.
Ms. GROSHEN. Actually, I have an answer. The two years
where there was no increase were 2009 and 2010. The Chained
CPI-U would have given three-tenths of a percent increase
rather than zero.
Mr. DOGGETT. Why is that?
Ms. GROSHEN. It is because--basically the substitution
effect.

[[Page 89]]

Mr. HORRIGAN. One of the issues is we had such a large
increase in energy prices in 2008 and then the decline, the way
the adjustment in Social Security works using the CPI-W is it
is compared to the previous peak.
We had two years where the Index was not above the previous
peak. However, with the Chained CPI, because of substitution,
it started at a lower level and came back a little bit faster.
Just in terms of the comparison of the previous year, it
hit that previous peak one year earlier with the way it is
adjusted, in the official way it is adjusted.
Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman JOHNSON. Thank you. Mr. Tiberi?
Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Mr. Doggett, can we
sign you up for that proposal now?
[Laughter.]
Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, if I were
watching on C-SPAN 25, on the Internet right now, I would be
pretty darn confused. I have to tell you, I am so blessed. I
have an 80 year old father, he is going to be 80 this year, who
came to America in 1950. In 1950, there were 16.5 workers for
every retiree on Social Security. There were not 10,000 people
retiring a day.
Now there are less than three workers for every retiree. My
dad had figured it out and my mom has figured it out, my mom
and dad still live in the same house I grew up in in Columbus,
Ohio--just got rid last year of their 18 year old car, not
because they wanted to but because it broke down, and Social
Security is still really, really important to them.
They look at their grandkids and they have again figured it
out, partly because of organizations like yours, who are doing
a great job of saying we have a problem, even though some
honorable folks even up here believe there is not a problem.
Here is what helped them.
Mr. BECERRA. Will the gentleman yield?
Mr. TIBERI. After my five minutes, I will.
Mr. BECERRA. I never said there is not an issue or
challenge for Social Security. I just said today using Social
Security funds to pay for deficits that it did not cause is the
problem.
Certainly, we all want to take care of Social Security long
term.
Mr. TIBERI. The long term for me is very quickly
approaching. When I get my Social Security statement now, it
says if we do nothing, if I go online, I will get approximately
72 percent of the benefits that I am supposed to get.
When I came in 2000, Mr. Becerra, it did not say that. I
used to talk about saving Social Security for my kids. Now it
is for people of my generation. My mom and dad get that, not
because they are concerned about me, but they are really
concerned about their grandkids.
If it is going to impact me in my generation, God help my
kids and their kids.
Sir, in your written testimony, which I thought was
awesome, you talk about the difference between the President's
proposal and the current law, and the difference it has in
terms of impact on benefits over a year, over a period of 20
years.
Can you expand on that for us?

[[Page 90]]

Mr. LORENZEN. I was speaking about the proposals on the
Chained CPI.
Mr. TIBERI. Yes, generally.
Mr. LORENZEN. With Chained CPI in place, benefits will
still be increasing in nominal terms, obviously.
Mr. TIBERI. Can you say that again? I could not quite hear
you.
Mr. LORENZEN. I am sorry. Benefits will still be increasing
in actual terms. They will be increasing slightly less than
they are under scheduled law, but doing it more accurately.
However, the Trust Fund is projected to be exhausted in
2033, at which point there will be a 25 percent reduction for
all beneficiaries. The Chained CPI would delay that exhaustion
briefly and make the shortfall thereafter smaller, so benefits
would be higher with Chained CPI because the Trust Fund has
money to pay benefits, but also because the initial benefits
are indexed to wages, that a future retiree is going to start
with a greater benefit in real inflation adjusted terms than a
previous retiree.
If you were to compare someone who retired in 1993 at age
55 with what their benefit is today and took a comparable
worker who retired today at age 65, 20 years from now when they
are 85, even if Chained CPI had been applied and there was not
any bump up in benefits or any other adjustments to compensate
for it, someone retiring today would still have a higher
benefit in real inflation adjusted terms at age 85.
Mr. TIBERI. Thank you. Commissioner, one last quick
question. To follow up on Mr. Doggett's point, if this is
enacted, long term, this is not even enough, correct? We need
to do more?
Ms. GROSHEN. I am sorry?
Mr. TIBERI. Because of demographics, in terms of Social
Security.
Ms. GROSHEN. The BLS does not do calculations of that.
Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Blahous.
Mr. BLAHOUS. You have to do a lot more.
Mr. TIBERI. We have to do a lot more. Any suggestions on
your part in terms of saving for my kids, saving Social
Security for them, at the same time not hurting current seniors
like my mom and dad?
Mr. BLAHOUS. I think we are in ``all of the above'' mode.
We have to make changes to the eligibility age. I think we have
to make changes to the benefit formula. I think we should slow
the rate of benefit growth on the high income end just by
making brute force changes in the benefit formula itself.
I think there are other changes we should make to improve
the work incentives in the system that would basically have the
effect of rewarding seniors for staying in the workforce
longer.
Mr. TIBERI. The longer we wait, the more difficult a
challenge it is?
Mr. BLAHOUS. Absolutely.
Mr. TIBERI. Thank you.
Chairman JOHNSON. We have to get it through the House and
the Senate.
[Laughter.]
Chairman JOHNSON. May or may not happen. Mr. Becerra for
half a minute.

Mr. BECERRA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to make
clear we are clear on something. We all say we want to preserve
Social Security. This is about making sure for our kids and our
grandkids, it is working as well as it has worked for our
parents and grandparents.
To try to make it sound like Social Security is having the
sky fall on it today when what the sky is falling on is the
Federal budget which has exhausted its resources and over
spent, not Social Security, to say that the Social Security
Trust Fund that Americans have created through their tax
contributions does not exist and the interest it earned, it is
like telling any American how much money do you have in your
pocket today, can you pay off your house and your car loan
today with the money you have in your pocket without going into
your savings account?
That is crazy. We have money in the savings account for
Social Security. It is there because Americans contributed
taxpayer money into that Fund.
To cut benefits, to discuss a budget deficit caused by
unpaid for wars or tax cuts that went to very wealthy folks,
that is just putting it on the backs of seniors.
I think a number of us are ready to engage in a
conversation about what we do long term to make sure Social
Security is viable for everyone.
To just cut seniors and veterans' benefits to deal with
today's budget deficits caused by other things, that is what
concerns many of us.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the time.
Chairman JOHNSON. The President likes the idea. Thank you
to our witnesses for their testimony. I also thank our members
for being here.
We know we have to do something to protect Social Security
long term, and we will do that. Come 2033, Social Security will
not be able to pay full benefits. Americans deserve a Social
Security program they and their children and grandchildren can
count on.
As our hearing series moves forward, I look to our
continued examination of bipartisan Social Security reforms. We
need to do right by today's beneficiaries and workers. When
there is bipartisan agreement, we can and should act, and we
will.
I want to thank you all for being here today. The meeting
stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
