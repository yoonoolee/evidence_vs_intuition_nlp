COORDINATING FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN BROADBAND

TUESDAY, JULY 29, 2014

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Livestock, Rural Development, and Credit,
Committee on Agriculture,
Washington, D.C.
The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:05 a.m., in
Room 1300 of the Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Eric A.
``Rick'' Crawford [Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding.
Members present: Representatives Crawford, Rogers, Conaway,

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ERIC A. ``RICK'' CRAWFORD, A
REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM ARKANSAS

The Chairman. Good morning. This hearing of the
Subcommittee of Livestock, Rural Development, and Credit to
coordinate future investments in broadband, will come to order.
Good morning, and welcome to this hearing to review
broadband deployment in rural America. In this modern age, it
is surprising to know that there are some parts of the country
where the live video feed from this hearing is not viewable by
our rural constituents due to a lack of broadband access. In a
time when commerce, leisure, and a transparent government rely
on robust networks, we still find communities which are not
connected through high-speed broadband. There are many
communities still struggling to recover from a poor economy to
attract new businesses and to connect new, critical services
not otherwise offered in remote areas. The key to unlocking
these opportunities lies in greater access to services which
are readily available in larger rural communities and in urban
areas.
It is important to note that broadband can add tremendous
educational opportunities to small communities. The ability to
access online courses, study materials, research, and online
lectures afford students some of the most efficient and cost-
effective avenues for not only continuing their education but
turning their curiosity into careers. And these opportunities
are supported through several programs which provide resources
to local facilities such as schools and libraries.
However, none of these opportunities can exist if the
community itself is not connected with a robust high-speed
network. Getting the most rural areas connected, much like the
Rural Electrification Act accomplished for telephone service,
remains a priority of this Committee. When the farm bill was
reauthorized this year, several provisions were included to
continue making these critical investments in small towns and
cities. I know in my district I too often visit towns and
communities who have been waiting patiently for years for full
access to the information superhighway. I know a lot has been
done to bring access to rural communities, but it is my goal
and the goal of this Committee to be able to do more than just
tell people to wait a little longer.
With us today we have representatives from USDA and
industry who are on the front lines of expanding broadband
service. The loan and grant programs provided through USDA and
reauthorized in the 2014 Farm Bill are specifically designed to
target the most rural and unserved areas in the country.
While the focus of this hearing is on the deployment of
broadband through RUS programs, these programs are not operated
in a vacuum. In the discussion today I believe it will be
helpful to review those changes in the recent farm bill in
light of the FCC's changes to how rural telecom companies
receive assistance. The efforts by the FCC to reform the USF
have a direct impact on smaller rate of return carriers who
both rely on USF support to provide service and RUS loans to
expand their coverage areas.
As the FCC transitions into providing telecommunications
access beyond traditional voice service, a careful coordination
among the responsible agencies is critical to ensure funds are
not wasted and the taxpayers receive the greatest return on
these investments. Coordination across government programs is a
major challenge in our nation made up of the various states,
counties and towns, each with their unique needs and
approaches. The same approach to deploying service does not
work well in all geographic areas. The Committee maintains the
technology-neutral approach to broadband, and today we look
forward to learning more about the various approaches being
taken to address the unique challenges in each area of rural
America.
Among the questions I believe our witnesses can help us
answer include, how are the current programs facilitating the
expansion of broadband network? How are providers taking
advantage of emerging technology? What are the roles of the
various types of providers in pushing farther into unserved
areas? And how are the elements of USF reform and USDA loan
programs coming together to ensure efficient use of resources?
I look forward to the testimony from our witnesses today to
help the Committee understand the barriers to broadband
deployment and how USDA is coordinating across related agencies
to ensure the most effective deployment of broadband possible.

The Chairman. Now I would like to recognize the gentleman
from California, the Ranking Member, Mr. Costa for 5 minutes
for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JIM COSTA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM CALIFORNIA

Mr. Costa. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I want to
thank the Members of the Subcommittee that are here. The title
of this morning's hearing, Coordinating Future Investments in
Broadband covers how we provide access to broadband throughout
America, the breadth and width, especially to our rural areas
that many of us represent as we try to take advantage of the
new technologies for all regions of America, and the panel, we
look forward to your testimony this morning as well as to those
here in the audience.
Rural America comprises \3/4\ of the nation's land area and
is home to more than 50 million people. We don't think about it
that way too often. We have almost 320 million people in the
country, and obviously the urban areas of America get the focus
most of the time. But rural America, think about it: \3/4\ of
the land area and 50 million people. Since the Great
Depression, the landscape of rural America has changed
dramatically, and our nation's policies related to that part of
the country have changed with it. Even as manufacturing in
service sectors have replaced agricultural production as the
dominant economic force in much of rural America, common needs
for our rural communities remain and therefore, again, the
importance of this Subcommittee hearing today.
The fact is: where you live, those 50 million people,
should not determine what kind of services are available to
you. The U.S. Department of Agriculture operates a number of
programs that are designed to expand access, in this case, to
broadband in rural areas, and funding was contained in the farm
bill that this Committee made some changes to that we passed
earlier this year. It was also part of a continuing effort in
the farm bill that we did 5 years ago, and it was also part of
an effort that we provided funding in the stimulus package back
in 2009 to provide connections in two different ways to
telecommunications companies throughout the country.
Whether it is in my home State of California or whether it
is across the country, Federal programs and private sector
service providers have made great progress in connecting rural
America. I want to highlight a few of the California figures
that illustrate why this issue of rural broadband is so
important, and like many Members, we all say, ``All politics
are local.'' So let me give you the perspective in terms of my
own district.
In 2008, a report by the California Broadband Task Force
showed that California led the nation in broadband penetration
with 96 percent of Californians having access to the
technology. According to the California Public Utilities
Commissioner's most recent statistics revised in June of this
year, 2014, the fixed broadband availability number now has
risen to 97+ percent. But this figure is also misleading. The
same statistics show that over 250,000 rural Californians still
lack access to broadband, even though the system has been
significantly expanded. However, just because broadband is
available, it doesn't mean that our constituents can use it, in
this case, my constituents. For example, in Merced County, in
my district, has a little more than 75,000 households,
broadband is available to 99 percent of those households, but
the California Public Utilities Commission says in Merced
County there is only 51 percent adoption rate, even though they
have a 99 percent penetration. What that tells me is that
despite the relative success of putting wires in the ground,
the Federal Government, broadband providers, and public
institutions still have a lot of work to do in bridging the
divide between the haves and the have-nots when it comes to
broadband, particularly in rural America.
Why does this divide remain and what are we doing to fix
the problem? I look forward to the testimony of our witness.
Despite the great work done in the 2014 Farm Bill on a
bipartisan level, and I want to commend my colleagues again for
that effort. What is disappointing is that I don't think that
here with this Committee or with the Department of
Agriculture--and this is just a gripe I have had for several
years now--that we address one of the biggest issues and that
is our Rural Development programs and the definition of what is
rural. And I will be on my soap box for 30 seconds here.
The fact is: my Congressional district, like many
Congressional districts, are very productive in terms of their
agricultural nature. But many of our communities are not only
rural but they are in many instances poor and disadvantaged.
All too often, communities in my district and across the
country are prevented from taking advantage of these programs
because we have a one-size-fits-all as it relates to the rural
definitions.
Despite the clear need, I think that we need to focus on
the eligibility for Rural Development programs, whether it is
in rural housing, health or essential community facilities,
largely because the criteria we use to define rural
communities--the cross cut across the country is not evenly
divided.
I appreciate the opportunity, Mr. Chairman, to hear from
the witnesses on both panels about what we can do to ensure
that everyone in our country, no matter where they live, where
they work, where they go to school, has access, which is so
important in the 21st century, to broadband and takes
advantages of these services so that we can economically
compete on a level playing field. So thank you very much for
giving me the time for the opening statement. I look forward to
the testimony and questions that we will have an opportunity to
ask.
The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for his opening
comments. I would request that other Members submit their
opening statements for the record so the witnesses may begin
their testimony and to ensure that there is ample time for
questions. Without objection, so ordered.
Our first panel is seated, and we are pleased to welcome
the Administrator of Rural Utilities Service in the United
States Department of Agriculture here in Washington, Mr. John
Padalino. And I want to thank you, Mr. Padalino, for taking the
time to be here. I know that you are on the cusp of a new
career. We will certainly miss your leadership. You have done a
fantastic job in your 5 years of service, and we wish you all
the best in your new challenge.
Having said that, we welcome your comments, and you are
recognized for 5 minutes, Mr. Padalino.

STATEMENT OF JOHN C. PADALINO, ADMINISTRATOR, RURAL UTILITIES
SERVICE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, WASHINGTON, D.C.

Mr. Padalino. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member
Costa, and Members of this Subcommittee. Thank you for the
opportunity to testify this morning regarding future
investments in broadband.
As Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service, I am proud
to lead an amazing group of people who are honoring their
predecessors in the Rural Electrification Administration by
continuing to encourage growth and development in rural areas
through investments in infrastructure.
The history of rural electrification and rural broadband
has many parallels. In the 1930s it took a series of Acts and
appropriations to establish a public system for financing,
designing, and planning rural electrification. Likewise, in the
21st century, it will take a sustained focus from Congress and
the Executive Branch to ensure that rural residents have the
same access to broadband as their urban and suburban
counterparts. This is why the Rural Utilities Service is as
relevant in the 21st century as the Rural Electrification
Administration was in the last.
Access to affordable broadband is important for economic
development, education, healthcare, energy and the environment,
government performance, civic engagement, and public safety.
Schools can engage in distance learning. Medical providers can
use remote medical diagnostics and monitoring. Farmers can
efficiently manage their crops by using advances in
agricultural technology. Yet, rural America faces challenges in
accessing this critical service. Rural areas remain behind non-
rural areas in broadband access. A 2012 study showed that 14.5
million rural Americans living in 6.5 million rural households,
nearly \1/4\ of the rural population, lack such access.
Rural areas also remain behind non-rural areas in adopting
available broadband. For example, Mississippi has a 26 percent
gap between urban and rural broadband adoption. In addition,
rural broadband deployment is costly, especially in remote,
frontier areas. It is estimated that the cost of reaching
250,000 housing units in those extremely rural areas will cost
$13.4 billion or an average of $53,600 per unit.
We cannot address this with loan dollars alone which is why
the Rural Gigabit pilot established by this Congress in the
2014 Farm Bill is so exciting. The Recovery Act also allowed
the Rural Utilities Service to explore and advance broadband in
hard-to-reach areas. It has expanded the capacity of our rural
communities beyond what they could do alone.
Investment in rural broadband must focus on three things:
connectivity, more work needs to be done to connect both the
un- and under-served; capacity, investments must focus also on
increasing the broadband speeds for those who do have access to
entry-level service; and creativity, we must look at levering
existing successes in rural areas by supporting rural
telecommunication providers and partnering with our rural
electric cooperatives in the areas where the large price-cap
carriers are not investing in broadband.
Since 2009 the Rural Utilities Service has invested over
$5.5 billion in broadband that will connect over 1.4 million
rural subscribers to new or improved service. The Rural
Utilities Service is focused on increasing capacity by insuring
that the Recovery Act funded projects through the Broadband
Initiative Program are completed on time and on budget. Today
almost 200,000 rural subscribers are receiving this service
with over 59,000 miles of fiber and over 1,200 wireless access
points currently deployed.
USDA and the Rural Utilities Service have been strong
advocates for rural consumers with the Federal Communications
Commission. In the last 2 years, Secretary Vilsack and I have
met with former Chairman Julius Genachowski and current
Chairman Tom Wheeler, each time stressing the importance of the
Rural Utilities Service and the Federal Communications
Commission working together, and we provided recommendations on
how to improve the Federal Communications Commission's
implementation of much-needed reforms through the Connect
America Fund.
The Rural Utilities Service telecommunication programs with
a combined loan portfolio of over $4.5 billion helped deliver
affordable and reliable advanced telecommunications services to
rural communities, services that are comparable to those in
urban and suburban America. We have a strong record of
supporting infrastructure upgrades, and together we can offer
even greater returns for our nation, including healthier, more
educated communities, and expanded markets for businesses.
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your continued interest and that
of the Committee in broadband programs. At this time I am happy
to answer any questions you might have. Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Padalino follows:]

Prepared Statement of John C. Padalino, Administrator, Rural Utilities
Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.
Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Costa, and Members of this
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify this morning
regarding Future Investments in Broadband.
The mission of the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) is to fund basic
infrastructure services, including electric, telecommunications, and
water and waste facilities in order to benefit rural America. RUS
infrastructure investments deliver reliable, affordable electricity to
power our homes and industries, broadband to expand access to
education, healthcare, business and social services in rural areas, and
clean, safe water to support healthy rural communities and meet the
growing needs of rural America.
As Administrator of RUS, I am proud to lead an amazing group of
people who are honoring their predecessors in the Rural Electrification
Administration by continuing to encourage growth and development in
rural areas through investments in infrastructure.
The history of rural electrification and rural broadband has many
parallels. In the 1930's it took a series of Acts and appropriations to
establish a public system for financing, designing, and planning rural
electrification. Likewise, in the 21st Century, it will take a
sustained focus from Congress and the Executive Branch to ensure that
rural residents have the same access to broadband as their urban and
suburban counterparts. The 1930 Census showed that ninety percent of
urban dwellers had access to electricity while only ten percent of
rural residents had similar access. Claiming lack of profitability,
private utilities declined to extend lines that would provide
electricity to rural areas.
The predecessor to RUS, the Rural Electrification Administration
(REA), was established by Executive Order signed by President Roosevelt
on May 11, 1935. The agency was created under authority from the
Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 a work relief bill that
authorized $100 million for rural electrification. A year later,
Congress passed the Rural Electrification Act fully establishing a long
term program to make loans available for the generation, transmission,
and distribution of electric energy in rural areas.
As the nation headed into World War II, it was estimated that
thirty-eight percent of rural Americans had no telephone service.
Commercial credit was not available because loans to rural systems were
not financially feasible. Referring to providing modern communications
in rural America, the REA Administrator stated in 1939 that
``Government assistance will be required if the job is ever to be
completed.'' REA's programs were successful in extending utility
service--electric and telephone--to persons in rural areas. By 1953
more than 90 percent of all farms in the United States had electricity.
In 1976, 90 percent of all farms had telephone service. At that time,
our investments in electric infrastructure and reliable telephone
service for those who live and work in rural areas improved the quality
of life for those Americans and strengthened the local economies.
The building of the rural electric infrastructure has facilitated
the use of diverse energy sources, including renewable energy sources
such as wind and solar power, and more. The modern business model for
energy services is likely to be a consumer-driven platform where
existing and rapidly advancing communications and electric technologies
are shifting the electric utility delivery marketplace from a
commodity-centric model to a consumer-centric model. Similarly, the
telecommunications industry made a paradigm shift from the central
switch of the telephone company to today's demand for ubiquitous
broadband delivered through the network and ordered up on smart
devices. Not surprisingly, the challenges faced during the
electrification of rural America resurfaced as private broadband
entities citing lack of end-users and profitability have not fully-
expanded broadband infrastructure into rural areas.
As a result, RUS is as relevant in the 21st Century as REA was in
the last century. RUS is actively positioning rural America--through
broadband investments--to compete in the global economy, benefit from
Internet-based educational opportunities, and take advantage of
telemedicine resources.
For example, in Arkansas RUS funded a telemedicine network through
the Distance Learning and Telemedicine program that has permitted
numerous patients, who previously would have been transported to Little
Rock, to receive local treatment at the direction of a remote
specialist.
Recently a patient who underwent surgery returned to the local
hospital 2 weeks later with a life-threatening blood clot in their
lungs. Utilizing the telemedicine network, a specialist in Little Rock
was connected to the patient and family, virtually at the patient's
bedside. The patient was able to be continuously monitored and receive
the best possible care without having to be transported to Little Rock.
The patient remained at the local hospital and made a full recovery.
Rural Utilities Service and Broadband
The broadband loan and grant programs at RUS are intended to
accelerate the deployment of broadband services in rural America.
``Broadband'' refers to high-speed Internet access and advanced
telecommunications services for private homes, commercial
establishments, schools, and public institutions. Currently in the
United States, residential broadband is primarily provided via mobile
wireless (e.g., ``smartphones''), cable modem (from the local provider
of cable television service), or over the telephone line (digital
subscriber line or ``DSL''). Other broadband technologies include fiber
optic cable, fixed wireless, satellite, and broadband over power lines
(BPL).
Broadband access enables a number of beneficial applications to
individual users and to communities. These include e-commerce,
telecommuting, voice service (Voice-over-Internet Protocol or
``VoIP''), distance learning, telemedicine, public safety, and others.
It is becoming generally accepted that broadband access in a community
can play an important role in economic development.
Telecommunications Programs
Since 1995, RUS has been in the forefront of meeting rural
consumers' demand by requiring broadband capable technology in all
telephone loans in order to play a major role in closing the urban
rural digital divide. Today, RUS is focused on funding and providing
broadband to rural America through the traditional telecommunications
program, the broadband program and the Broadband Initiatives Program
(BIP) funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Recovery Act). Through Recovery Act investments alone, RUS awarded
over $3.4 billion in funding for broadband projects and has helped
extend broadband access in rural areas. As a result of the Recovery Act
BIP program, over 59,566 miles of fiber and 1,281 wireless access
points have been deployed to serve over 168,703 households, 12,539
businesses, and 1,786 critical community facilities across rural
America.
Broadband and Rural America
Access to affordable broadband is viewed as particularly important
for the economic development of rural areas because it enables
individuals and businesses to participate fully in the online economy
regardless of geographical location. For example, aside from enabling
existing businesses to remain in their rural locations, broadband
access could attract new business enterprises drawn by lower costs and
a more desirable lifestyle. Essentially, broadband potentially allows
businesses and individuals in rural America to live locally while
competing globally in an online environment.
Bobcat Company in Gwinner, North Dakota is a perfect example of the
need for rural broadband infrastructure to compete in the global
economy. RUS provided several infrastructure loans to Dakota Central
Telephone Company (Daktel), and most recently a BIP loan and grant to
assist with addressing the challenge of rapidly expanding the access
and quality of broadband services. Bobcat is a large manufacturing
employer in rural North Dakota. The company has one of the most
extensive compact equipment distribution networks in the world and uses
Daktel's fiber network to link to other company locations around the
world.
Given the large potential impact broadband may have on the economic
development of rural America, concerns have been raised over a
``digital divide'' between rural and urban or suburban areas, with
respect to broadband deployment. While there are many examples of rural
communities with state-of-the-art telecommunications facilities, recent
surveys and studies have indicated that, in general, rural areas tend
to lag behind urban and suburban areas in broadband deployment. For
example, according to the Federal Communications Commission's Eighth
Broadband Progress Report, released in August 2012, of the 19 million
Americans who live where fixed broadband is unavailable, 14.5 million
live in rural areas.
The 2013 Department of Commerce report, Exploring the Digital
Nation: America's Emerging Online Experience, found that while the
digital divide between urban and rural areas has lessened since 2007,
it still persists with 72% of urban households adopting broadband
service in 2011, compared to 58% of rural households.
The comparatively lower population density of rural areas is likely
the major reason why broadband is less deployed than in more highly
populated suburban and urban areas. Particularly for wireline broadband
technologies--such as cable modem, fiber, and DSL--the greater the
geographical distances among customers, the larger the cost to serve
those customers. Thus, there is less incentive for companies to invest
in broadband in rural areas than, for example, in an urban area where
there is more demand (more customers with perhaps higher incomes) and
less cost to wire the market area.
The terrain of rural areas can also be a hindrance, in that it is
more expensive to deploy broadband technologies in mountainous or
heavily forested areas. An additional cost factor for remote areas can
be the expense of ``backhaul'' (e.g., the ``middle mile''), which
refers to the installation of a dedicated line that transmits a signal
to and from an Internet backbone, which is typically located in or near
an urban area.
As a result, the economic impact on rural America of not having
broadband is significant. For example, an economic study from Oregon
State University in 2014 provided data showing the impact on rural
Oregon communities with increased broadband adoption between 2008 and
2011. There was positive impact on changes in median household income
and total employment (analysis limited to non-metro counties) over a
short period of time.
Conclusion
Broadband deployment is increasingly seen as providing a path
towards greater regional economic development. From our long history of
working with companies in rural America and providing capital for
broadband infrastructure, we know that many rural areas, due to factors
such as low population density and high costs associated with difficult
terrain, have difficulty attracting the investment required for a
sustainable broadband operation.
To meet the goal of increasing economic opportunity in rural
America, RUS programs finance rural telecommunications infrastructure.
RUS telecommunications programs, with a combined loan portfolio of $4.6
billion, help deliver affordable and reliable advanced
telecommunications services to rural communities--services comparable
to those in urban and suburban areas of the America. Infrastructure
investments offer returns for rural America--building, deploying, and
using broadband increases access to health care and education, expands
markets for businesses, and increases the quality of life for rural
Americans. None of this can happen without expanding broadband
connectivity and capacity in rural America.
I thank the Committee and its Members for their continued interest
in broadband programs.

The Chairman. I thank the gentleman for your testimony. I
would also like to make a correction. Obviously, I
mispronounced your name. My apologies, Mr. Padalino. I said Mr.
Padalino. So that is probably not the first time that has ever
happened.
Mr. Padalino. It is not the first time. My grandfather did
say never let them get your name wrong, but out of due respect,
I did not correct you.
The Chairman. I appreciate that. My apologies. Thank you
for your opening comments. I recognize myself for 5 minutes.
In a report dated May 2014, the GAO cited a high number of
failed projects. In the details of that report they seem to
refer interchangeably to rescissions and defaults. Do you agree
that the two outcomes should be in the same category? And can
you explain how those should be viewed?
Mr. Padalino. Thank you for that question. I don't agree
that they should be considered in the same category. A
rescission is markedly different than a default. A rescission
is a project where we have obligated funds to the project, and
for some reason, the project applicant couldn't meet the
conditions to have the loan closed. And over a certain amount
of time the agency will make a decision or maybe even at the
request of the applicant to rescind the funds. The funds come
back to the government, either go back to Treasury or are
turned around for future loans. So that is a rescission. A
default is where a project is underway, advances have been made
by the agency, and for some reason the loan applicant cannot
make a repayment. And they are talking about monetary defaults
in this situation, and those are markedly different.
When I read the GAO report--thinking about rescissions, I
thought, that is good government. That is us doing our job at
the Rural Utilities Service to make sure that an applicant
comes up with the needed working capital, that comes up with
the needed conditions to make sure that that loan can close,
and if that can't happen, we will rescind the money and turn
that money back around.
On defaults: this is a new program. It has only been in
place a little over 10 years thanks to Congress in the 2002
Farm Bill amended in the 2008 and again in the 2014. And as I
noted in my opening remarks, the history of rural
electrification, the history of rural broadband has a lot of
starts and stops. We have learned lessons from the farm bill
program, from the Recovery Act program, and have implemented
those in our regulations. In some ways, we have been ahead of
the GAO in looking at our program.
The Chairman. In that same report, concerns were raised
that USDA may not have a process in place to ensure that
approved loans were not rescinded because of a lack of working
capital on hand which often resulted in wasted effort by RUS
and tied-up funds which could have otherwise been used on
projects elsewhere.
Can you explain why this would be the case and what USDA is
doing to address that concern now?
Mr. Padalino. Yes, thank you. The 2008 Farm Bill had a ten
percent equity requirement, and that is the requirement that
really ensures that there is working capital available. It
provided the Secretary discretion to have additional
requirements if, in the agency's discretion, we felt that more
cash was needed to ensure that during the time of construction,
enough working capital was available when there are negative
cash flows to make sure that construction can go to completion
and can get through the first few years of service. Out of the
2008 Farm Bill, when we published the interim rule in 2011 and
then the final rule in 2013, as an agency, we added an
additional cash requirement from those lessons learned from the
early days of broadband. That additional requirement, cash
requirement, focuses on start-up operations, on operations that
have had negative cash flows for the 2 years prior to
submission of a loan application. We feel that that is a strong
signal that we are looking at cash flow, at the working capital
issue. That is the number one issue when it comes to either a
project being rescinded or even a default.
The Chairman. Okay. The FCC has pursued several major
changes to the Universal Service Fund, and I have mentioned
this in my opening statement. How has that impacted investments
through RUS programs, and can you share your insights on how
those changes might influence the approach taken by RUS
borrowers when considering plans for expansion of services?
Mr. Padalino. Whenever I am asked about--I would just like
to note that on one hand it is good policy to shift from a
telephone-based support mechanism to a broadband base support
mechanism. When the FCC issued their Order, their
Transformation Order, in 2011, what we saw is demand for RUS
investment almost come to a halt. It really has chilled
investment in rural areas because the Order, while well-
meaning, had a lot of undetermined business, undecided business
in there where an investor, a small company in rural areas,
cooperative-owned company in rural areas, they just didn't want
to make future investments not knowing what the regulatory
policy was going to be. So far the FCC has implemented some of
the reforms that they said were to be determined in that 2011
Order, but more remains and even some of the reforms that have
been issued have caused some detrimental effects to rural
areas.
The Chairman. Thank you. I have run out of time. I would
like to recognize the Ranking Member, the gentleman from
California, Mr. Costa, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Costa. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Padalino,
what tools would you describe--and I know in your testimony you
listed some of them--that you think are available that we
should be focused on with regards to the Rural Utilities
Service to get the rural areas connected across the country to
some of those areas that I represent, for example?
Mr. Padalino. Well, thank you for that question. The
available tools that we have in the loan programs we have the
Traditional Infrastructure Loan Program available to
communications providers who are focusing on communities 5,000
or less, the Broadband Loan Program focused on----
Mr. Costa. So that would include as I discussed with you
earlier--I don't know if there is such a definition, mom-and-
pop telephone companies anymore. But we do have these smaller
companies that really are a reflection of some that have been
owned in a family for 50 or 100 years or longer that have
20,000 connections or whatever the number may be. This would
provide support for them because I have seen that example
successfully utilized.
Mr. Padalino. Yes, two of the providers in your district
are owned by a parent company, but those two providers are
those rural local exchange carriers who have taken advantage of
the Infrastructure Loan Program for the last 60 years since
Congress established it in 1949. It has been a great tool. It
has been a great resource for our rural telecommunications
providers out there. The Broadband Loan Program tried to expand
the reach so we could go beyond the rural local exchange
carriers into that price-cap territory where the big providers
just weren't providing broadband service.
We also have the Community Connect Grant Program that
really focuses on communities that are wholly unserved,
provides grant funds so we can establish a broadband system and
network in that community, also together with the community
center so people can learn to use the broadband once it is
available. We have the Distance Learning Telemedicine Program
in Arkansas. I visited Baptist Health in Little Rock where
there is a floor on the hospital that doctors are available 24/7 that is providing medical services to rural clinics across
the state. Those are the tools that we have available.
We also have to provide technical assistance. Just in the
past few months, we have done a number of broadband workshops
across the country where we focus on areas that are unserved or
under-served receiving broadband--
Mr. Costa. To that point, and I used that in my statement,
what is the technical assistance that you provide for lower
income communities so that we can improve the adoption rates as
the example I used in Merced County? But I know those adoption
rates are a problem throughout the country.
Mr. Padalino. Well, part of my perspective at the Rural
Utilities Service has been to look what we did back in the REA
early days where we not only provided the access to funding to
build the electric systems but we had road shows essentially
that went out and taught people how to use the electricity once
they had it. We had people who walked you through all the
different appliances that would be available, and the broadband
workshops are focused on an economic development perspective
from the theme of: ``You have broadband, now what,'' to make
sure that if a community that doesn't have broadband receives
loan funds or a grant to build a broadband system, that they
have a plan to use that broadband so more and more people will
adopt it.
Mr. Costa. It is our understanding that no broadband loans
will be awarded until the new regulations implementing the
latest farm bill are developed. When do you expect these new
regulations to be released so that the broadband loans can be
expanded?
Mr. Padalino. The 2014 Farm Bill was passed in February,
signed into law in February. We have been hard at work with the
regulations, and we expect that they will be published in
calendar year 2015.
Mr. Costa. And then the loan program can proceed following
that?
Mr. Padalino. Yes, Congressman, as soon as the--
Mr. Costa. So we are to tell our constituents that until
2015, you are not going to be able to proceed with any of the
loan programs?
Mr. Padalino. We won't be able to process the loans, but
there is a lot of front-end work that folks can take a look at
the statute already and see what the requirements are, see what
the service area requirements are in the statute that is out
there and that we are happy to talk to them in general about
broadband but we won't be able----
Mr. Costa. Let me get to one other technical question here
because it deals with the Recovery Act funding. Under the
Broadband Initiative Program projects must be completed by June
2015. All the funding will expire by 2015. Given that 85
percent of the projects are not yet completed, do you expect
that any projects still not completed by June 2015, how many
would you estimate and what steps can the Rural Utilities
Service provide to ensure that these projects will be completed
after that date?
Mr. Padalino. Sure. Thank you for that question. We are
focused on all the projects that are within construction. We
have 255 active projects right now.
Mr. Costa. Two-hundred and fifty-five?
Mr. Padalino. Seventy-five percent of the funds have been
disbursed already. We work with each awardee almost on a weekly
basis via telephone or site visits. We are constantly engaged
with each awardee. We expect all the projects will be completed
as proposed. Throughout the 4 or 5 years of the Recovery Act,
we have seen projects that fall in and out of being at risk of
not be in completion, and one issue or another may arise. We
work with the awardee to try to resolve that issue, and we so
far have been successful with that and we plan to continue
those steps going through the next year. June--
Mr. Costa. Go ahead.
Mr. Padalino. June of 2015 is our contractual requirement
that they be substantially complete, and by the end of
September by statute the funds will be no longer available.
Mr. Costa. Thank you. My time has expired.
The Chairman. I thank the Ranking Member and recognize the
gentleman from New York, Mr. Gibson, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Gibson. I thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for
putting this together. And Mr. Padalino, I just want to say how
much we appreciate your service. Our district has really
benefitted from your leadership. We have had conference calls
together. We have worked on a number of issues, and I just
greatly appreciate you and your team. We want to wish you the
best, going forward, and I know that the continued outstanding
service will be with your successor.
So just a couple things. First of all, just a testimonial
how important the telemedicine aspect is to rural areas. I will
tell you that one of the pilot hospitals, Margaretville, has
two doctors. They happen to be a married couple. And what a
huge difference the telemedicine pilot project made. And they
were actually able to deliver their first baby since the 1970s
with this. It is a very small hospital in rural America. And
then also, after Hurricanes Irene and Lee, they saved two
lives. A tree came down on the chest, and they were able to
consult with the broadband capacity with experts from fairly
nearby, about an hour's drive, hospitals and made a huge
difference, saved lives.
And finally on this score, this couple was able to take
their first vacation in 4 years because they were still
accessible, and they actually consulted on a medical procedure
from Bali. We are able to keep a couple in this hospital which
allows us to keep this going. So I just want to underscore how
important these programs that you are leading, how important
they are to rural America.
In your comments you talked about--which I really want to
affiliate and associate myself with. You certainly didn't show
any prejudice to any particular approach, whether it be big
company or small company. But you did note that a lot of the
small companies are very aggressive on this score, and I would
concur. I mean, these family-owned businesses, they live in our
communities. They see firsthand every day the impact on
education, on healthcare delivery, on job creation, on quality
of life that access to high-speed broadband can make a
difference, and conversely, when you don't have it, what the
impacts are. As I look at this issue, again, I am happy to see
anyone advance rural broadband from any perspective, and we
work together on the Committee here. We played a role in the
recent farm bill and some of the reforms to bring transparency
and effectiveness.
Looking at the FCC's program and your program, I am
interested in ways we can continue to build out capacity and
empower our smaller companies. My read of the initial rules, or
I should say the rules coming out on the FCC, is that my
smaller companies and the rural co-ops are going to get a
better access to some of the Connect America funds. That is my
read of it, and I am encouraged. I would be curious to know if
that is your read. And then, going forward, I am interested in
also, might there be ways so we can improve some of the
programs under the RUS so we can get these smaller companies in
the rural co-ops to find this profitable?
One of the ideas that I had--well, actually, it was I think
Senator Gillibrand and I concur is that we could tweak the
program a little bit, provide for--if you bring ten percent
non-Federal money, then you would get a ten percent grant, and
the balance, the 80 percent, would be in the low-interest loan.
I am curious to know your feedback on that. Sorry I went on so
long.
Mr. Padalino. Well, thank you for your compliments,
Congressman, and to get right to your questions, FCC recently
announced the rural broadband experiments is Phase II of the
Connect America funding, and they are trying to make, for
price-cap areas, they have established a budget of $100 million
to make that money available for a 10 year recurring basis to a
wide variety of providers, including electric cooperatives, to
compete for that money, to say we can put the best project out
there in those areas. And I agree with you that the electric
co-ops were started by community members, the telephone co-ops
were, even the for-profit telecommunication companies are
locally owned, and I really believe that local people in rural
areas are the best resource for advancing that.
And some of the tweaks we can think about is how we can
leverage our rural electric providers out there, the rural
electric cooperatives. You know, they have a much larger
footprint than some of our smaller rural telecommunications
companies, and how can we build a partnership between those
rural telecommunications and rural electric cooperatives,
together with the FCC, combine the support mechanisms from the
FCC with the low-cost loans? I am interested in that proposal
that you talked about, about bringing in private investment.
The Administration recently announced the Rural Opportunity
Investment Fund. There is going to be a source of private money
there, and with a solution like that we can leverage more and
more resources to advance the cause of broadband.
Mr. Gibson. Thank you. Thank you very much, and good luck
to you, going forward, too. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. You bet. The gentleman's time has expired. I
now recognize the gentleman from Minnesota for 5 minutes, Mr.
Nolan.
Mr. Nolan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to join my
colleagues in commending the Administrator for the terrific job
that you are doing, and I want to commend my Chairman and
Ranking Member for conducting this hearing. As one who lives in
the remote areas of northern Minnesota on a farm where the
Little Pine and the Big Pine River come together, I was an
early beneficiary of the advantages of broadband which greatly
enabled me to expand and conduct my international business as
an exporter of American goods and services.
And I am of the view that expansion of broadband to rural
areas may be singularly the most important thing that we can do
to expand business opportunities in rural areas for small
business. And it is no secret that most new jobs and economic
development in this country occur from the small business
sector, and in essence, what broadband does for rural areas, it
puts them in the same position that a big, multi-national
corporation would be sitting in Manhattan or Minneapolis or Los
Angeles when it comes to their communications with the rest of
the nation, the rest of the world in making readily available
to them all the knowledge, information, and services that are
out there.
So I just want to commend you for what you are doing and
the Chairman for conducting this important hearing and lend my
support and my encouragement to all that you are doing. Keep up
the good work, and keep pushing and you have a lot of people
here who believe in what you are doing and want to help in any
way and every way we can to help facilitate that. Thank you.
Mr. Padalino. Well, thank you, Congressman. The Rural
Utilities Service is really a gem in the Federal Government. It
is the only Federal agency that directly finances
infrastructure. We hear a lot of talk about building
infrastructure banks, green banks, all kinds of banks, but we
have one that Congress established 80 years ago. It is the
Rural Utilities Service, and we have been hard at work
providing infrastructure investments from our water and waste
systems to our electric systems. We are trying to build a new,
energy-efficient rural America, and of course, advance the
cause of broadband. So thank you for your remarks.
The Chairman. The gentleman yields back. With that I just--
before we conclude this panel, Mr. Padalino, I wanted to expand
on a point that the Ranking Member brought up, the current
projects under way, funding expires June 2015. Just to clarify,
if a project that is currently under way is not completed by
2015, what would then be the disposition of those projects?
Mr. Padalino. If a project ends up at the end of September,
September 30, 2015, without being complete, they will no longer
have funds available from RUS. So whatever funds remain undrawn
won't be available anymore. They could still complete their
project with some other financing, but those Recovery Act
provided dollars will revert back to the Treasury.
The Chairman. Okay. Thank you. And again, we do want to
thank you for taking time out to come. Ranking Member?
Mr. Costa. Just to follow up, if the gentleman would yield.
Now, it seems rather abrupt. I guess I am trying to understand.
Let us say one of these rural telephone companies has a loan or
a grant. They can be either. And let us pick a number for
discussion purposes. It is a $1 million grant for improvement
for access. And they have let the contracts to the improvements
and they have spent half of it or 60 percent of it but they are
not complete. And June 2015 runs around, and all of a sudden,
they are left--even though they have let the contracts for the
other $400,000 because it is not completed?
Mr. Padalino. Our focus has been to ensure that doesn't
happen. We have been--over the last few years, we asked in
early September--or January 2012, all the awardees, where are
you at with your construction? Do you need to amend your
timelines so we can understand where you are at? We have
numerous webinars. We are about to send out another letter
reminding awardees that you are about a year out from
completion. We need to know where you are at. We stay at the
local level through our general field representatives that are
very engaged with the borrowers through site visits, phone
calls. We require numerous reports----
Mr. Costa. So let me make a suggestion. I think that is all
good, but the Members of this Subcommittee, and maybe it is
something staff could work with the Members of the full
Committee, but it would be nice if we had a listing of--I don't
know if the number is 255 or whatever you stated earlier--these
projects that are currently ongoing so that we could know those
that are in our respective Congressional districts, and we
could help complement your efforts to say, ``Look. You are on a
timeline here, and you need to do everything you can to
expedite it so that you are able to complete the project,''
because that would--certainly we would like to know. I don't
think any of us would like to find a situation where next March
we have our local telephone company calling us and saying, ``We
are \2/3\ done with our project, but we are not going to
complete it until August, and they are telling us now we are
going to run out of their money. What can you do to help us?''
The Chairman. If the gentleman would yield, clarification
between grants and loans? If we could have that as well on
those 255 projects that you mentioned because that
clarification would be helpful as well. And if you could make a
distinction? I understand a grant is obviously different than a
loan, but are we going to see that funding unavailable for
loans that have already been made as well, or can they reapply
at some point if in fact they didn't meet that timeline?
Mr. Padalino. I thank you for your offer, and we really
appreciate the assistance and will be happy to work with the
staff on providing that information.
[The information referred to is located on p. 53.]
Mr. Padalino. Just a couple quick clarifications. On those
255 active projects, 44 of those have been fully complete. We
have over about 140 of them that are partially complete which
means they are providing broadband in all or part of their
service territories, but there is just some remaining punch
list items to be completed. Again, 75 percent of the funds have
been disbursed. Over 90 percent of the proposed miles of fiber
and proposed wireless access points have been deployed. Where
many of these projects are is at the last phases of the project
where they are doing the cut-overs, connecting subscribers to
those services. But we really appreciate the offer of support,
and I am happy to work with your staff.
The Chairman. All right. Thank you. The gentleman yields.
With that, Mr. Padalino, again, we want to dismiss you with our
thanks for your service and with our best wishes for your
future, and we appreciate you. Thank you so much.
Mr. Padalino. Thank you.
The Chairman. We will now move into our second panel, and
as our panel takes position, I will go ahead and introduce
those individuals. Comprising panel two, Mr. Lang Zimmerman is
the Vice President of Yelcot Communications in Mountain Home,
Arkansas. He is testifying on behalf of the National
Telecommunications Cooperative Association. Mr. David Cohen,
the Vice President for Policy, at USTelecom based here in
Washington, D.C. Mr. Robert L. Hance, President and CEO,
Midwest Energy Cooperative, Cassopolis, Michigan, testifying on
behalf of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association,
and Mr. Christopher Guttman-McCabe, Executive Vice President,
CTIA--The Wireless Association here in Washington, D.C.
Welcome. Gentlemen, we appreciate you being here, and with
that, I will introduce our first panelist, Mr. Lang Zimmerman
who, as I said, is Vice President of Yelcot Communications in
Mountain Home, Arkansas, which is, I am proud to say, in my
Congressional district. Mr. Zimmerman and to all our panelists,
I will just remind you. You see the lights in front of you?
Green means you are good to go, and it is just like when you
are driving. If you see a yellow light, go like heck because it
is fixing to stop. And when you see the red light, that means
stop. And we will take your expanded comments and your written
comments, but for the sake of time, we would just ask that you
limit your oral presentation to 5 minutes. And with that, I am
pleased to recognize Mr. Lang Zimmerman for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF LANG ZIMMERMAN, VICE PRESIDENT, YELCOT
COMMUNICATIONS, MOUNTAIN HOME, AR; ON BEHALF OF NTCA--THE RURAL
BROADBAND ASSOCIATION

Mr. Zimmerman. Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Costa, and
Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to
participate in today's discussion. My name is Lang Zimmerman,
and for the past 29 years I have served as Vice President of
Yelcot Telephone Company, headquartered in Mountain Home,
Arkansas, and my remarks today are on behalf of Yelcot as well
as NTCA--The Rural Broadband Association and their several
hundred small community-based members that provide a variety of
communications services throughout the rural far reaches of the
nation.
We believe our industry is uniquely qualified to
participate in today's discussion because we are small
businesses on the front lines deploying high-speed, sustainable
broadband to rural America. Yelcot is a carrier of last resort
and has always operated under the premise that if someone wants
service in our service area, then we do whatever it takes to
serve them. Because of this commitment, and with the aid of key
Rural Development programs and Universal Service support, rural
Arkansans throughout the Yelcot service area, and indeed
throughout the markets of all the NTCA members, have access to
reasonably comparable services at reasonably comparable rates
as mandated by current and longstanding law.
Small, rural telecom members of NTCA provide access to
voice, video, wireless and broadband Internet services as well
as enhanced emergency preparedness. Most importantly, they
connect rural Americans to the entire world. In rural America,
that translates into economic development that produces jobs.
Broadband has become essential to delivering healthcare,
educational opportunities, and securing the public safety. And
much of the business world is already demanding higher
broadband speeds to help it interact with and sell to customers
near and far. Broadband and other services provided by the
rural telecom industry serve as an incubator for small business
ideas in rural America to be implemented and to flourish.
Yelcot's top priority has always been to provide every one
of our consumers with the very best communications and customer
service possible at affordable rates that stimulate adoption.
The entrepreneurial spirit of Yelcot is representative of our
approximately 1,000 small, rural counterparts in the industry
who together serve about five percent of the U.S. population
across approximately 40 percent of the nation's geographic land
mass.
USDA's Rural Utilities Service, RUS, plays a crucial role
in rural broadband deployment through its telecom loan
portfolio that finances networks upgrades and deployment in
rural areas. RUS lending and USF support are inextricably
linked as 99.2 percent of RUS telecom infrastructure borrowers
like Yelcot receive high-cost USF support. The presence of
high-cost recovery is crucial to the ability of RUS borrowers
to repay our RUS telecom and broadband loans. RUS programs have
helped rural providers deploy modern networks in many rural
areas where the market would otherwise not support the
investment. Reliable access to capital helps rural carriers
meet the broadband needs of consumers at affordable rates.
Yelcot has first-hand experience working with RUS, and I
can testify to the benefit of having an experienced lender
available to finance projects at a fair rate. Yelcot and our
rural consumers continue to benefit from the RUS
Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program, which has
financed upgrades of our network to the fiber era. In the past
few years, with the help of RUS, Yelcot companies have added
over 130 miles of buried fiber cable, replaced ten central
offices with four soft switches and added or replaced over 50
remotes.
Unfortunately, applications for RUS telecom loans are down
dramatically at a time when customers everywhere are clamoring
for faster broadband. Why would an experienced lender such as
RUS want for loan applications when demand for networks is
high? Look no further than the state of rural telecom
regulation which includes an opaque and unpredictable USF
capping mechanism originally tossed out after years of lost
investment, a requirement for customers to purchase landline
voice service in order for their line to receive U.S. support
and plans to increase rural telephone rates to $20.46 in
Arkansas while the monthly rate in Washington, D.C. will remain
at $14.10.
We appreciate the support of those Members of Congress who
have contacted the FCC regarding the state of rural telecom
regulation. In particular, I would like to thank you, Chairman
Crawford, for signing a letter to the FCC regarding the
outdated requirement for customers to purchase landline voice
service in order for their line to receive USF support.
The benefits that some rural communities are already
experiencing will only be possible for all if robust broadband
is available and affordable. Rural telecom providers and
lenders such as RUS must have regulatory certainty before they
can make greater investments in the networks of the future. The
key to regulatory certainty is a USF remade for the broadband
era, including a broadband-oriented support mechanism for small
carriers that gives rural consumers options in selecting
services that best fit their needs.
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I look
forward to answering any questions you may have.

Prepared Statement of Lang Zimmerman, Vice President, Yelcot
Communications, Mountain Home, AR; on Behalf of NTCA--The Rural
Broadband Association
Introduction
The Rural Telecommunications Industry
Thank you for the invitation to participate in today's discussion
on coordinating future investment in broadband. For the past 29 years I
have served as Vice President of Yelcot Telephone Company, which is
headquartered in Mountain Home, AR. My remarks today are on behalf of
Yelcot Telephone Company, as well as NTCA--The Rural Broadband
Association and their several hundred small community-based members
that provide a variety of communications services throughout the rural
far reaches of the nation.
We believe our industry is uniquely qualified to participate in
today's discussion because we are small businesses leading the way in
deploying high-speed, sustainable broadband to rural America. Yelcot,
similar to about \1/2\ of the nation's small, community-based rural
providers, is a commercial company. Family or commercially-owned rural
providers are consumer-centric because they are locally owned and
operated. Likewise, in the cooperative structure that makes up the
other \1/2\ of small rural providers, the consumers are also the
owners, so every choice is viewed from both an owner and a consumer
perspective--the two are truly one and the same.
Yelcot is a carrier-of-last-resort and has always operated under
the premise that if someone wants service in our service area, then we
do whatever it takes to provide the would-be customer with that
service. Ever since Yelcot began operating in 1957, we've been proud to
serve as the only provider to some of the most rural areas of Arkansas,
while other carriers avoided investments in such areas and chose to
serve only the most profitable and densely populated towns. Because of
this commitment, and with the aid of key rural development programs and
Universal Service support, rural Americans throughout Yelcot's service
area, and indeed throughout the markets of NTCA members, are enjoying
universal voice service, access to mobile, video, and broadband
Internet services, and enhanced emergency preparedness.
Small, rural telecom providers connect rural Americans to the
world. Moreover, these rural network operators have been at the
forefront of the broadband and Internet Protocol (``IP'') evolution for
years, making every innovative effort to deploy advanced networks that
respond to consumer and business demands for cutting-edge services. In
rural America, that translates into economic development that produces
jobs, not only in agriculture, energy and other industries with a
strong rural presence, but in the healthcare sector, and just about any
other retail industry that requires broadband to operate in this day
and age. Broadband has become essential to delivering healthcare and
securing the public safety. And much of the business world is already
demanding higher broadband speeds to help it interact with and sell to
customers near and far. Broadband and other services provided by the
rural telecom industry serve as an incubator for small business ideas
in rural America to be implemented and to flourish.
Fixed and mobile broadband, fixed and mobile voice, video, and
Internet Service Provision are among the numerous telecom services that
rural Americans can access thanks to the rural industry commitment to
serving sparsely populated areas. Broadband-capable networks facilitate
greater interconnection of the community's resources and can enable
citizens' participation in the global economy, blue-ribbon education,
first-rate healthcare, cutting-edge government services, robust
security and more efficient energy distribution and use.
The rural telecom industry has always been at the forefront of
technological innovation, being the first segment of the industry to
completely convert to digital switched systems, provide wireless
options to their hardest to reach customers, offer distance learning
and telehealth applications, provide cable-based video, then satellite
video, and now IP video to their markets, and it was a member of the
RLEC community that first deployed an all-fiber system. The rural
industry continues to lead in the deployment of broadband capable
infrastructure.
Yelcot Telephone Profile
Yelcot's top priority has always been to provide every one of our
consumers with the very best communications and customer service
possible at affordable rates that stimulate adoption. Yelcot has
several lines of business, including ILEC, CLEC, ISP and Cable TV.
While our headquarters are in Mountain Home, we in fact serve over
7,946 customer lines across our 826 square mile rural service area that
is spread across northern Arkansas. This constitutes about 9.6
customers per square mile. We employ a total of 52 people and in 2013
our annual operating revenue was about $13.8 million. Our service area
is rural and sparsely populated, requiring great effort to get advanced
services to our customers.
The entrepreneurial spirit of Yelcot is representative of our
approximately 1,000 small rural counterparts in the industry, who
together serve 5% of the U.S. population across approximately 40% of
the nation's geographic land mass. Like the vast majority of our rural
colleagues, Yelcot has been an early adopter of new technologies and
services. In 2006, Yelcot upgraded its network to ADSL2+ (Fiber-to-the-
node). Yelcot currently has 10 Megabit broadband service available to
60% of our ILEC service area and 1.5 Megabit broadband available to 98%
of our service area. We can provide gigabit service where our fiber-to-
the-premises facilities are located. This fiber connection allows for
nearly limitless amounts of bandwidth. We know our customers will
require more and more bandwidth and have built a network that will
supply it.
RasorNET
Yelcot's reach extends beyond our service area to an exciting
partnership with Ritter Communications, South Arkansas Telephone, and
New Wave Communications to build RasorNET, a fiber backbone that
delivers 10 gigabit Ethernet transport, enhanced wireless backhaul, and
connections to other fiber backbones around the country. RasorNET
greatly enhances the online experience for all of Arkansas by providing
robust connectivity between major metropolitan areas and rural
communities in Arkansas. Only fiber connections will meet the
astronomic wired and wireless broadband demands of the near future, and
we're thrilled to help meet those consumer needs through RasorNET and
the fiber connections Yelcot delivers to the end user.
Rural Broadband Benefits the Entire U.S. Economy
A series of recent studies confirms that significant benefits flow
from rural broadband investment to broader urban and statewide
populations. The rural telecommunications industry supported $14.4
billion of economic impact in 2009, with $9.5 billion occurring in
urban areas, and more than 70,000 jobs, 45% of which were placed in
urban areas.\1\ In Colorado, rural telecom helped create 428 jobs,
adding over $21 million per year to state payrolls.\2\ North Dakota saw
an additional $18 million in Federal tax revenue and $31 million in
state tax revenue arising out 1,100 direct jobs and 800 secondary jobs
generated by rural telecommunications activity.\3\ The converse holds
true, however, from adverse changes--``reforms'' that cut investment in
rural broadband hurt state economies. In Kansas, for example, potential
cuts in Federal rural telecom programs led to projections of $1.4
million in personal income tax and $1.3 million in retail sales tax
losses.\4\ A personal income loss of $14.1 million was projected for
2012 alone in New Mexico from the same proposed cuts.\5\ Studies
examining the impact of rural communications activity--including
purchasing, employment figures, and projected tax revenues--confirm
rural communications to be a powerful generator of urban economic
growth and Federal and state tax revenue. In short, rural broadband is
an investment with real benefit and returns for the nation as a whole.

To not have access to high-speed Internet in this day and age is
unimaginable to most people, yet millions of Americans live in areas--
mostly in rural territory served by carriers other than small, rate-of-
return providers--where there is no robust broadband that enables
meaningful access to the countless economic and educational
opportunities available through the Internet. These people have small
business ideas that need broadband to succeed and they need jobs that
small businesses can provide. Yet, as important as it is to deliver
broadband to the unserved, it's just as vital that those already
receiving broadband remain served--the benefits that flow from
broadband are ongoing. If a network is built but then becomes
unsustainable or the services over it unaffordable or of poor quality,
such developments deny the benefits of broadband for small businesses
and all consumers.
Rural Utilities Service Financing
RUS Role in Rural Telecom Deployment
USDA's Rural Utilities Service (RUS) plays a crucial role in rural
broadband deployment through its telecom loan portfolio that finances
networks upgrades and deployments in rural areas. RUS has been lending
for broadband capable plant since the early 1990s. RUS lending and
Universal Service Fund (USF) support are inextricably linked as 99.2%
of RUS Telecommunications Infrastructure borrowers receive high cost
USF support. The presence of high cost recovery is crucial to the RUS
telecom and broadband loan calculus. RUS programs have helped rural
providers deploy modern networks in many rural areas where the market
would otherwise not support investment. Reliable access to capital
helps rural carriers meet the broadband needs of rural consumers at
affordable rates.
Unfortunately, the success, momentum, and economic development
achieved from the RUS's telecommunication programs were put at risk as
a result of the regulatory uncertainty arising out of USF reforms that
are discussed in greater detail below. It will be all the more
important to continue providing RUS with the resources it needs to lend
to the rural telecom industry as demand for financing will inevitably
increase when reforms are improved and small carriers are given
certainty, hopefully through a program like the Connect America Fund
that is designed to promote broadband investment. As Congress continues
to grapple with where to best direct scarce resources, it's important
to note that the RUS Broadband Loan Program and the traditional
Telecommunication Infrastructure Loan programs are funded with loans
that must be paid back with interest--creating a win/win situation for
rural broadband consumers and taxpayers. Rural providers look forward
to building on an already successful partnership with RUS.
Yelcot has first-hand experience working with RUS and I can testify
to the benefit of knowing that an experienced lender is available to
finance projects at a fair rate. Yelcot and our rural consumers
continue to benefit from the RUS Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan
program, which has financed upgrades of our network to the fiber era.
In the past few years, with the help of RUS, Yelcot companies have
added over 130 miles of buried fiber cable, replaced ten Central
Offices with four soft switches and added or replaced over 50 remotes.
Originally, a large Tier 1 provider was the only upstream transport
provider in one of our service areas, charging $220.00 per Mb. The Tier
1 provider would not upgrade their equipment, effectively capping the
upstream transport in that service area at 145 Mb. In another Yelcot
service area, there were few upstream transport options, and those were
costly at $150.00 per Mb. In 2009 Yelcot began an extensive fiber
project that took 4 years to complete. This project allowed us the
opportunity to connect with other upstream providers, as well as
providing a redundant upstream route. Yelcot now pays $8.12 per Mb, and
has over 30 times the original capacity.
Thanks to these lower costs and increased capacity, Yelcot has
recently doubled almost all of our subscribers' bandwidth with no price
increase whatsoever.
The Farm Bill Reauthorization
During the most recent farm bill reauthorization process, we
appreciated this Committee's efforts to make sensible changes to the
RUS Broadband Loan Program to ensure transparency, while avoiding
program performance delays and additional burdensome requirements on
borrowers. It is essential that small, rural providers are able to
access the RUS program without delay. Efforts to dramatically rewrite
the program, such as those proposed by the bill that the Senate
initially passed, would have resulted only in keeping broadband
investment on the sidelines and denying rural areas much-needed access
to broadband.
The multi-year rule implementation delay that resulted from the
2008 Farm Bill and the regulatory uncertainty arising out of the FCC's
efforts to reform Universal Service initiatives have left the Broadband
Loan Program and subsequent investment at a standstill. We hope the
most recent farm bill changes to the program do not result in another
multi-year implementation delay. Thankfully, it appears that the final
farm bill left RUS with discretion in administering the program that
grants sufficient leeway to make it function more smoothly than the
initial Senate farm bill would've allowed. Further, it is important
that Congress not tie RUS's hands by putting limited funds toward
projects that would offer a few people more bandwidth than they need
while others still lack reasonable broadband speeds. It is time to get
the Broadband Loan Program back to work for rural consumers.
The IP Evolution and Universal Service
The FCC's Universal Service Fund Reforms
Applications for RUS telecom loans are down dramatically at a time
when everyone is clamoring for faster broadband. According to a May
2014 GAO report, RUS received 29 applications for loans in Fiscal Years
2011-2013, compared to 130 in the first 3 full years of the program.\6\
Why would an experienced lender such as RUS want for customers when
demand for networks is high? Look no further than the state of rural
telecom regulation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For some rural areas, FCC rules still require customers to purchase
landline voice service in order for their line to receive USF support.
The customer is effectively denied the option of cutting the landline-
voice cord and purchasing only broadband. All the while, the FCC
continues to design new caps for the legacy USF that was intended to
support voice telephony. The last attempt to cap USF was thrown out
after pressure from Congress highlighted the regulatory uncertainty and
lost investment produced by the FCC's opaque, unpredictable mechanism.
Scarce resources are being put toward developing new caps, while small,
rate-of-return providers await a broadband-oriented mechanism such as
the Connect America Fund (CAF) that larger price-cap carriers already
have access to. The price-cap providers' CAF is in year 4 of
development--a good indication that greater emphasis should be placed
on finishing a similar fund for small carriers as soon as possible.
The situation grew more desperate on March 20, 2014, when the FCC
announced that the ``local rate floor,'' to which small, rural carriers
must increase their local voice telephone rates by July 1, 2014 to
avoid losing certain Universal Service support, would increase from $14
to $20.46. The agency later agreed to push the compliance date back to
2015 and phase in the increase, but the underlying methodology that
produces the rate floor remains flawed. The rate floor is meant to
guarantee compliance with a statutory directive to ensure ``reasonable
comparability'' in rural and urban rates. ``Reasonable comparability''
does not mean the rates should be exactly the same, but does allow the
FCC to work with state stakeholders on a methodology that reflects
inherent differences in the deployment and operation of rural and urban
networks, as well as the simple fact that the rural customer can call
much fewer people through local service than the urban customer. If not
addressed promptly, the rate hike will likely lead some consumers to
``cut the cord'' on voice service, which would drastically increase
their broadband rates due to the aforementioned lack of a CAF for small
providers that supports broadband-capable networks.
Such outdated rules that undermine consumer freedom and inhibit
technological evolution present an obstacle to the technology
transition that consumers and industry are making and the FCC is
working to expedite and facilitate in other contexts. Universal Service
support should not be tied to a limited service, but available instead
to advanced networks that provide consumers with access to a variety of
essential, high-quality services from which each consumer may choose.
The FCC should move forward immediately to adopt and implement a
carefully tailored update of USF that will provide sufficient and
predictable support for broadband-capable networks in areas served by
smaller rural carriers. Over 130 Members of Congress--including
Chairman Crawford and other Agriculture Committee leaders--along with
dozens of organizations that serve rural America encouraged the FCC to
act through a series of letters earlier this year.\7\

Senate letter led by Senators Thune and Klobuchar, both sent to FCC

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The broadband revolution presents major opportunities for small
businesses to innovate and grow, but the business (or entrepreneur with
an idea) must have broadband access to take full advantage. Markets
will ensure many consumers realize the full benefits of innovation at
the lowest possible prices, but in rural areas there are often no such
markets to speak of. Though small, rural providers have been leaders in
broadband investment even under the current statutory and regulatory
regime, further law and policy changes will be necessary to ensure high
cost rural areas remain served while providers edge out into unserved
areas.
The Role of the Communications Act and Potential Reforms
The delivery of voice and nearly every other telecom service is
undergoing transformative change through the IP Evolution--that is,
telecom and information services are increasingly converging as IP
applications that run over broadband. This phenomenon has rendered the
current legal regime outdated, as it regulates the same service
differently based on the technology platform the service rides on.
IP, wireless, and other technological advances are changing the
marketplace in ways unimagined even a few years ago, but technology
alone will not miraculously solve the high costs of rural broadband
deployment. Indeed, the IP Evolution that is already occurring under
existing regulatory frameworks will be promoted and sustained only
through careful, focused statutory and policy updates that are guided
by the Communications Act's core principles of consumer protection,
competition, Universal Service, and public safety. Similarly, NTCA's IP
evolution petition filed with the FCC in late 2012 called for a careful
regulatory approach to the transition that considers what rules make
sense in this broadband age if we're to remain true to those same core
principles. Given the challenges to serving rural areas, the answer
won't be the legal and regulatory status quo, nor will it be complete
deregulation.
The Communications Act's timeless goal of making advanced
nationwide and worldwide wired and wireless networks available and
affordable for all Americans \8\ is as important as ever in an
increasingly interconnected and competitive broadband-based economy.
This Universal Service mandate, which builds upon decades of national
policy, has been--and remains--essential in enabling small rural
providers to deploy and upgrade cutting-edge networks over time where
no other carrier or entity could find a business case to do so.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ 47 U.S. Code  254(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A faithful and disciplined approach to the core Communications Act
principle of Universal Service must ensure that, even in the event of
any statutory or regulatory update, those areas served through support
from Federal and state USF mechanisms not only ``become'' served in the
first instance, but that they ``remain'' served, and that consumers and
businesses everywhere can make full use of advanced communications
services at affordable rates. Further, Congress should ensure that
specific, predictable and sufficient support will continue to be
provided to help ensure reasonably comparable services at reasonably
comparable rates in rural, high-cost areas, as mandated by current law.
Congress should also consider an express directive to the FCC to
ensure that all who use our nation's networks--by whatever service or
technology--are responsible to contribute to the universal well-being
and availability of those networks on an equitable basis. USF is still
funded by assessing interstate and international long distance
telephone service. The pool of assessable telecommunications service
revenues is shrinking even as overall communications-related revenues
grow. As a result, the USF program effectively has an artificial
funding ceiling that lowers a bit each day due to the failure to
broaden the contribution base and to stem the incentives (and
abilities) that are in place today which encourage or allow entities to
avoid contributing. This de facto cap on the USF program will handicap
severely our nation's ability to fulfill the statutory core principles
of Universal Service, competition, and public safety, unless changes
are made. Indeed, broadening the contribution base to include the
information services that USF already supports has previously received
bipartisan backing in the U.S. House.\9\

Rural Broadband Experiments
The FCC recently adopted a report, Order and further notice of
proposed rulemaking for rural broadband experiments. The Order
implements a $100 million budget funded by unused Connect America Fund
support. Hundreds of NTCA member companies--including Yelcot
Telephone--and other entities have already expressed initial interest
in participating in these rural broadband experiments, consistent with
their decades-long commitment to solving the communications needs of
rural communities. This small, rate-of-return carrier commitment to
service was highlighted by the FCC's decision to only accept
applications to deploy networks in locations served by price-cap
carriers. We are interested in seeing the precise rules that will
govern these experiments, and we are hopeful that they will help
further the mission of Universal Service consistent with applicable
law.
Conclusion
Entrepreneurial small rural carriers have leveraged private
capital, Universal Service support, intercarrier compensation, and
public-private partnerships to lead the ongoing IP Evolution. These
small businesses play an essential role in deploying broadband to rural
areas, and the services enabled by broadband are essential to the
startup, operation, and growth of other rural small businesses. Rural
America has a bright future powered by smart technologies that promote
affordability, sustainability, and efficiency in the operation of rural
industry and the delivery of essential services such as healthcare,
education, and public safety--all key to rural population growth. The
benefits that some rural communities are already experiencing will only
be possible for all if robust broadband is available and affordable.
Rural telecom providers and lenders such as RUS must have regulatory
certainty before they can make greater investments in the networks of
the future. The key to regulatory certainty is a broadband-oriented
support mechanism for small, rate-of-return carriers that gives rural
consumers options in selecting the services that best fit their needs.

The Chairman. Outstanding. Right before the red light. That
was perfect. Thank you, Mr. Zimmerman.
I am pleased to recognize now Mr. David Cohen, Vice
President of Policy, USTelecom, Washington, D.C. Mr. Cohen, you
are recognized for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF DAVID COHEN, VICE PRESIDENT, POLICY, UNITED STATES
TELECOM ASSOCIATION (USTELECOM), WASHINGTON, D.C.

Mr. Cohen. Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Costa,
Subcommittee Members, thank you for the opportunity to present
the progress being made in bringing broadband to rural
American.
It is timely and appropriate to review how the Rural
Utilities Service and the Federal Communications Commission can
coordinate to extend and improve broadband availability.
I am David Cohen, and I serve as Vice President of Policy
at USTelecom. Our association represents innovative broadband
companies including some of the largest companies in the U.S.
economy as well as small cooperatives and family-owned
providers. We share the determination to bring broadband
services to all Americans.
Our members have spent enormous sums and made great
progress in bringing broadband to rural areas. Seventy-eight
percent of Americans living in rural areas have access to wired
broadband. However, more can and should be done.
The FCC's Universal Service Fund, USF, and the Telecom Loan
Programs of RUS are complementary elements in building out
rural broadband.
As the FCC continues modernizing USF, coordination with RUS
is necessary. The FCC should remain cognizant that RUS has a
large portfolio of loans to borrowers that derive a significant
portion of their revenues from USF. USF must also ensure a
predictable level of future support so that carriers can
confidently plan, borrow, and invest in facilities.
In 2011 the FCC adopted the landmark USF Order which
changed USF from supporting voice service to supporting
broadband. The FCC created a two-phase Connect America Fund,
CAF, for price-cap companies serving rural America including
AT&T, CenturyLink, Frontier, Windstream and others but did not
replace the legacy USF mechanism for smaller, rate-of-return
companies. The FCC noted the amounts of traditional USF for
price-cap carriers had not provided sufficient funding to
deliver broadband. As a result, 85 percent of the 18 million
Americans lacking adequate broadband live in price-cap areas.
CAF Phases I and II were designed for those areas that had
historically been under-funded by USF.
To spur immediate build-out, the FCC provided interim
support of over $500 million to price-cap carriers willing to
take on broadband service obligations to which companies added
hundreds of millions of dollars of their own. Consequently,
almost a million more rural Americans will be connected to
broadband.
CAF Phase II, the permanent mechanism for price-cap areas
is expected to begin in 2015. It will offer price-cap companies
a fixed amount of money to meet vigorous broadband service
obligations. The FCC provided price-cap carriers an initial
opportunity to access CAF II funds. The FCC wisely rejected
calls by some to jump in front of the line and overturn that
FCC decision to make the most efficient and cost-effective use
of the limited funds to build out rural broadband.
The FCC anticipates in asking price-cap carriers whether to
accept the obligations and funding by the end of this year.
Where price-cap companies don't elect funding, the FCC will
conduct an auction open to all those willing and able to
undertake the broadband obligations.
It is important to distinguish between CAF Phase II and the
FCC's Rural Broadband Experiments Program. The FCC allocated
$100 million for experiments to explore how to structure the
auction and to engage interest in deploying new networks. The
program drew 1,000 expressions of interest. Of the 690 that
USTelecom sampled, 78 percent asked for more than the support
available. So while many would-be providers may make facile
representations about being able to provide broadband service
in rural areas, even under the very informal expressions of
interest process almost four out of five proposed to do so
above the FCC's reserve prices.
The FCC has made less progress in establishing a USF
program for rate-of-return carriers. The program doesn't
support rural lines where the customer gets broadband from the
rural carrier but voice from someone else. To plan, borrow and
invest in broadband, small companies need a USF that supports
broadband-only lines and has some certainty as to future
revenues.
The FCC hasn't adopted a plan that allows small companies
in RUS to determine which future loans and investments are
feasible. The rural telecom industry has proposed such a plan
which the FCC should seriously consider.
In conclusion, the targeted assistance offered by RUS
coordinated with the FCC's USF program remain essential to a
healthy rural economy. Thank you for your commitment which we
share to accelerate rural development by making broadband
available to rural America.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Cohen follows:]

Prepared Statement of David Cohen, Vice President, Policy, United
States Telecom Association (USTelecom), Washington, D.C.
Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Costa, Members of the Committee,
thank you for giving me the opportunity to appear before you today to
present the progress being made by our member companies in bringing
ubiquitous high-speed broadband service to rural Americans. Immense
benefits accrue to rural areas where broadband service is present,
including enabling rural development, distance learning and remote
health care. It is timely and appropriate that the Subcommittee take
time to review how the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) are coordinating to extend and improve
broadband availability in difficult to serve low-density rural areas.
My name is David Cohen and I serve as Vice President of Policy at
USTelecom. Our association represents innovative broadband companies
ranging from some of the largest companies in the U.S. economy to some
of the smallest cooperatives and family-owned telecom providers in
rural America. Our members offer a wide range of communications
services on both a fixed and mobile basis, and the overwhelming
majority of them offer advanced broadband services including voice,
video and data. Rural America relies on our members' wireline networks
for service to consumers and to make the connections to cell towers to
enable wireless communications. The customers who rely on our networks
include residential consumers, businesses large and small, and
government entities at the local, state and Federal levels. What unites
our diverse membership is our shared determination to deliver broadband
services to all Americans--regardless of their location.
Investment in broadband network infrastructure has created jobs,
spurred innovation, and revolutionized the way Americans learn, work,
communicate, and shop. That investment is particularly important in
rural America because broadband can overcome barriers such as distance
and remoteness that can impede development. Our members have spent
enormous sums and made great progress in bringing broadband to rural
America. Today, according to a report by the Commerce Department's
National Telecommunications and Information Administration reflecting
mid-2013 data, 78 percent of Americans living in rural areas have
access to wired broadband. But we are not here to rest on our laurels;
more can and should be done to increase the availability and
performance of broadband in rural areas.
The FCC and RUS Should Continue to Coordinate Efforts to Bring
Broadband to Unserved Areas
The High-Cost Universal Service Fund (USF) administered by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Broadband and
Infrastructure Loan Programs of the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) are
key complementary elements in deploying cutting edge communications
services to rural America. As the FCC modernizes the USF program to
conform to developments in technology and in the marketplace,
coordination between it and RUS is necessary to continue the progress
that has been made to build out broadband facilities in rural areas.
The FCC should remain cognizant that RUS has a sizeable portfolio of
loans to borrowers that derive a significant portion of their revenues
from USF. Future USF mechanisms must ensure reasonable predictability
as to the level of future support so that carriers can confidently
plan, borrow and make long-term investments in building out fixed cost
facilities designed to last for decades.
USF for Areas Served by Price Cap Companies
In 2011 the FCC adopted its landmark USF/ICC Transformation Order,
designed to evolve its high-cost Universal Service regime from
supporting voice service to supporting broadband. In that Order, the
FCC created a two-phase Connect America Fund (CAF) for the larger,
price-cap companies such as AT&T, CenturyLink, Windstream and Frontier,
and reformed but did not replace the legacy USF mechanism for smaller,
rate-of-return companies such as Smithville in Chairman Crawford's
district and Kerman in the district of Ranking Member Costa. The FCC
noted that at the time it adopted its Order, more than 83 percent of
the approximately 18 million Americans lacking access at or above the
FCC's broadband speed benchmark lived in areas served by price-cap
carriers. The FCC's National Broadband Plan explained that while the
old system of funding for such carriers supported phone service to
lines served by price-cap carriers, the amounts did not provide an
incentive for the costly upgrades necessary to deliver broadband to
these customers.
CAF Phase I and CAF Phase II are essential vehicles for providing
necessary support to price-cap service areas that historically have
been under-funded because of inadequate USF support. By targeting
funding to the locations served by price-cap carriers, CAF Phase I
incremental support and CAF Phase II are instrumental to achieving the
Commission's broadband deployment goals.
To spur immediate build out in price-cap company areas, the FCC
offered additional funding under its CAF Phase I program to price-cap
carriers that elected to take on the obligations associated with the
funding. Not only did price-cap companies accept over $500 million in
CAF Phase I funds, they kicked in hundreds of millions of dollars of
their own capital to bring broadband to rural areas. Construction is
well underway pursuant to that funding and, according to the FCC,
almost a million more rural Americans are already or soon will be
receiving broadband service.
The FCC has not yet implemented CAF Phase II, the permanent CAF
mechanism for areas served by price-cap companies. Implementation is
expected early in 2015. The FCC has consistently and wisely rejected
calls by some to jump in front of the line and overturn the FCC's
considered decision to make the most efficient and cost-effective use
of the limited funds available in order to accelerate the availability
of broadband to rural Americans. The FCC has done this by providing
price-cap carriers with an initial opportunity to expand and upgrade
service by accepting CAF Phase I and CAF Phase II funds.
CAF Phase II will offer price-cap companies a fixed amount of
money, determined for each state by a cost model, to meet vigorous
broadband service obligations. Under the current CAF Phase II
structure, a company electing to participate in a particular state
would receive 5 years of CAF support (for an investment amortized for
up to 25 years) and be obligated to provide broadband speeds at 4 Mbps
downstream and 1 Mbps upstream. The FCC is considering increasing the
speed requirement to 10 Mbps downstream which, because of the
additional costs involved in providing faster service, should be
accompanied by a longer funding term and greater program flexibility.
USTelecom supports the adoption of the higher speed requirement if
accompanied by modifications to the terms of support including the
provision of funding for 10 years. The FCC has committed to making this
determination soon and price-cap carriers will be electing whether to
accept the state-level obligation and funding by the end of this year.
In states in which price-cap companies do not elect funding, the FCC
will conduct a competitive bidding process open to all those willing
and able to undertake the broadband obligations. Winners in the
competitive bidding process will receive support for 10 years.
The FCC's Rural Broadband Experiments
It is important to distinguish between the CAF Phase II mechanism
and the Rural Broadband Experiments program recently adopted by the
FCC. That program is budgeted at a one-time amount of $100 million and
will be used by the FCC to explore how to structure the CAF Phase II
competitive bidding process in price-cap areas and to gather valuable
information about interest in deploying next generation networks in
high-cost areas. USTelecom shares the Commission's goal of ensuring
cost-effective and universal broadband connectivity in rural America.
The FCC's Rural Broadband Experiments program drew more than a thousand
``expressions of interest'' from potential participants. Those
participants will now be able to submit formal applications for
funding. USTelecom reviewed a random sample of 690 of the more than
1,000 expressions of interest filed for the Rural Broadband
Experiments. The results of USTelecom's review suggest that most of the
substantive expressions of interest sought levels of funding
substantially greater than the CAF Phase II model-based support for the
proposed service area. The results show that 78 percent of the sampled
expressions of interest asked for more than the CAF II support
available and that on average the requested amount for this group was
almost ten times more than the available support. Overall, the 227
expressions of interest reviewed under USTelecom's streamlined approach
sought almost four times the CAF Phase II support available, asking for
$2.4 billion in support for Census tracts identified as having $620
million in available support. So while many would-be providers may make
facile representations about being able to provide broadband service in
rural areas, even under the very informal ``expressions of interest''
process, almost four out of five proposed to do so at funding levels
above the reserve prices set by the FCC.
USF for Rate-of-Return Companies
In contrast to the CAF program to provide support in areas served
by price-cap carriers, the FCC has made less progress in establishing a
high-cost Universal Service program to provide support to smaller rate-
of-return carriers serving rural areas. The current program does not
provide support to rural lines where the customer subscribes to
broadband service from the rural local exchange carrier but obtains
voice service from another carrier, usually a mobile provider. Also,
the amount of funding provided to rate-of-return companies is based on
legacy mechanisms developed to support voice services. In order to
plan, borrow and invest in long-term broadband facilities, rate-of-
return companies need a high-cost USF mechanism that is designed for
the new broadband world, supports broadband-only lines and incorporates
a reasonable amount of certainty as to future revenues. While the FCC's
recent repeal of its Quantile Regression Analysis (QRA) limitation on
support that could be provided to individual carriers was a major step
in the right direction, the FCC is still developing a plan that small
rural carriers, and RUS, can quantify and evaluate to determine which
future loans and investments are feasible and whether past loans and
investments can be repaid. The rural telecom industry has proposed a
plan that would carefully transition from the current mechanisms to new
broadband mechanisms and operate within the established budgetary
limitations. The FCC should give this plan serious consideration.
USTelecom members appreciate the strong support the Agriculture
Committee has provided for RUS telecommunications programs since their
inception in 1949. RUS endures because it is a public-private
partnership in which the borrowers are the conduits for the Federal
benefits that flow to rural telecom customers--the true program
beneficiaries. The targeted assistance offered by the RUS broadband and
telecommunications loan programs--thoughtfully coordinated with the
FCC's high-cost programs--remain essential to a healthy and growing
rural economy and contribute to the provision of universal
communications services comparable to those found in urban areas.
In closing, let me again thank the Subcommittee for holding this
timely hearing. We share the Subcommittee's commitment to accelerating
rural development by making broadband services available to rural
American homes, businesses, schools, libraries and healthcare
institutions and we look forward to our continued work together to
address this constantly evolving challenge.

The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Cohen. Next I am pleased to
recognize Mr. Robert L. Hance, President and CEO of Midwest
Energy Cooperative, Cassopolis, Michigan, testifying on behalf
of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. Mr.
Hance, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF ROBERT L. HANCE, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, MIDWEST ENERGY COOPERATIVE, CASSOPOLIS, MI; ON BEHALF
OF NATIONAL RURAL
ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATION

Mr. Hance. Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Costa, Members
of the Subcommittee, good morning. My name is Bob Hance. Thank
you for the opportunity to testify before this distinguished
Subcommittee to coordinate future investments in rural
broadband.
I am the President and CEO of Midwest Energy Cooperative,
an electric cooperative serving more than 35,000 members in
southern Michigan, northern Indiana, and Ohio.
I am also testifying on behalf of the National Rural
Electric Cooperative Association. NRECA is the national service
organization for more than 900 not-for-profit rural electric
utilities that provide energy to over 42 million people in 47
states. Electric cooperatives own and maintain 2.5 million
miles of the nation's electric distribution lines, covering 75
percent of the U.S. landmass.
In the 1930s, rural electric cooperatives like Midwest
Energy answered the call of rural America to bring electricity
to the countryside. Electricity was a vital and transformative
product that larger investor-owned utilities were unwilling and
unable to provide to rural America. Today, Midwest Energy and
other rural electric cooperatives are again answering the call
to develop the next transformative utility, robust broadband. I
am proud to discuss with you Midwest Energy's rural broadband
initiative offered through our telecommunications subsidiary,
Midwest Connections.
According to a recent NTIA study, only 23 percent of rural
residents have wireline broadband at a speed of 50 Mbps
compared to 98 percent of urban residents. The National
Broadband Map and anecdotal evidence from our members suggests
that in the Midwest service area, 50 Megabits is even less
available. Significant gaps in the availability of broadband in
rural America strand our members on the wrong side of the
digital divide.
In response to member demand, Midwest began investigating
the opportunity to provide this valuable service. It became
clear that although billions have been spent in rural
telecommunications, little infrastructure exists in rural areas
to provide broadband. Midwest explored satellite and broadband
over power line solutions, but they all failed to provide
reliable and scalable service. Ultimately, Midwest designed a
243 mile fiber ring through utility substations and facilities
for the immediate purpose of fostering a smarter grid for our
members. Leveraging this key asset provides us a unique
opportunity to deploy high-speed, next-generation broadband
solutions where one currently does not exist.
Midwest and other rural electric cooperatives need your
support to compete for the billions of dollars available to
provide broadband in high-cost areas. Midwest and more than 100
other electric cooperatives filed expressions of interest in
response to a request by the Federal Communications Commission.
The overwhelming response prompted the FCC to move forward with
conducting rural broadband experiments. Any company interested
in providing robust broadband may bid for financial support.
The Commission is actively considering whether or not to
similarly extend the opportunity to compete to areas covered by
unsuccessful experiment applications.
Rural electric cooperatives like Midwest are championing an
inclusive competitive process. The FCC will consider the
comments of industry, consumers, and legislators in conjunction
with its experience in the rural broadband experiments to allow
competition in rural areas for building broadband networks.
The FCC is poised to award almost $20 billion of Connect
America funding to support high-cost areas. This is a once-in-
a-generation opportunity to deploy broadband in rural
communities who deserve to be full participants in our modern
economy. Midwest and NRECA appreciate the efforts of the FCC to
create an inclusive environment where all eligible providers
have an opportunity to compete for support in offering creative
solutions and to close the gap between broadband available in
urban and rural areas.
In conclusion, cooperatives like Midwest Energy are well-
suited to build and maintain broadband networks. We aren't
asking for preferential treatment, just an opportunity to
compete. We do not seek to exclude anyone from the
conversation, but we do believe that a narrow view of the
solution may condemn our communities to the wrong side of the
digital divide.
I want to repeat this last point. Midwest advocates for an
inclusive opening of opportunity to provide broadband to
service rural counties. The status quo approach is exclusive
and limits opportunity to those who have always received high
cost support. Given the current lack of broadband in rural
areas, Midwest strongly believes that if the Commission and
Congress do not open the playing field to competition, rural
America may never have the chance to experience the educational
opportunities, employment prospects, and advanced healthcare
that broadband delivers to those lucky enough to live in low-
cost, high-population centers.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify before this
distinguished Subcommittee. I welcome any questions.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Hance follows:]

Prepared Statement of Robert L. Hance, President and Chief Executive
Officer, Midwest Energy Cooperative, Cassopolis, MI; on Behalf of
National Rural Electric Cooperative Association
Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Costa, and Members of the
Subcommittee:

Good morning. My name is Bob Hance. Thank you for the opportunity
to testify before this distinguished Subcommittee to discuss
coordinating future investments in rural broadband.
I am the President and CEO of Midwest Energy Cooperative, an
electric cooperative serving more than 35,000 members in Southern
Michigan, Northern Indiana and Ohio. I've worked in the electric
cooperative business since 1974.
I am also testifying on behalf of the National Rural Electric
Cooperative Association (NRECA). NRECA is the national service
organization for more than 900 not-for-profit rural electric utilities
that provide electric energy to over 42 million people in 47 states or
12 percent of electric customers. Electric cooperatives own and
maintain 2.5 million miles or 42 percent of the nation's electric
distribution lines, covering 75 percent of the U.S. landmass and serve
an average of 7.4 consumer owners per mile.
In the 1930s, rural electric cooperatives, like Midwest Energy,
answered the call of rural America to bring electricity to the
countryside. Electricity was a vital and transformative product that
larger investor-owned utilities were unwilling and unable to provide to
rural America. Today, Midwest Energy and other rural electric
cooperatives are again answering the call to develop the next
transformative utility, robust broadband, in rural America. I am proud
to discuss with you Midwest Energy's rural broadband initiative,
offered through our telecommunications subsidiary, Midwest Connections.
According to a recent NTIA study, only 23 percent of rural
residents have wireline broadband at a speed of 50 Mbps compared to 98
percent of urban residents.\1\ The National Broadband Map and anecdotal
evidence from our members suggests that in the Midwest service area, 50
Mbps is even less available.\2\ Significant gaps in the availability of
broadband in rural America strand our members on the wrong side of the
digital divide. Without robust access to broadband, these Americans
cannot take advantage of the educational opportunities or employment
prospects that most Americans now take for granted. Our members are
clamoring for access to the same level of broadband access as urban
Americans. For example, professors from both the University of Notre
Dame and Western Michigan University live within the Midwest service
territory. They enjoy robust broadband at work, but when they come home
they lose the ability to work because they lack sufficient broadband
service.\3\ We've heard similar complaints from members who work at the
Kellogg World Headquarters in Battle Creek, the Whirlpool World
Headquarters in Benton Harbor and at Pfizer's large manufacturing
facility in Portage.\4\ The modern world demands reliable, affordable
access to broadband.

\2\ See the National Broadband Map. http://www.broadbandmap.gov/speed.
\3\ Midwest sent a Call to Action to its members to gauge the
interest in deploying broadband. Within days, Midwest received more
than 600 responses. One member noted: ``We need to finish the job of
providing broadband to rural areas even when it doesn't fit a profit
model. The expense to not providing national coverage to all
populations is far more costly. Let rural electric cooperatives that
are poised to deliver a high-speed broadband solution do what they do
so well; provide service to rural America.''
\4\ There are many other significant educational institutions and
world class employers in and near Midwest's service territory. The
economic viability of rural areas depends on the extension of
broadband.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to member demand, Midwest began investigating the
opportunity to provide this valuable service. It became clear that
although billions have been spent in rural telecommunications, little
infrastructure exists in rural areas to provide broadband. Midwest
explored satellite and broadband over power line solutions, but they
all failed to provide reliable, scalable service. Ultimately, Midwest
designed a 243 mile fiber ring through utility substations and
facilities for the immediate purpose of fostering a smarter grid for
our members.\5\ Leveraging this key asset provides us a unique
opportunity to deploy a high-speed, next-generation broadband solution
where one currently does not exist. Construction has begun and will
continue to roll out slowly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ The Executive Summary for Midwest's fiber project is attached
as Exhibit A.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rural electric cooperatives, like Midwest, provide service to more
than 42 million Americans. We serve the lowest population density by
mile.\6\ Electric cooperatives grew out of a need to serve communities
where no other utilities saw adequate financial incentive. We are
closely connected to our members and we leverage that relationship to
be as responsive as possible to their needs. Today, our members tell us
that need is broadband.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ Cooperatives serve an average of 7.4 members per mile compared
to Municipal electric companies who serve 48 customers per mile and
Investor-Owned Utilities that serve an average of 34 customers per
mile.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Across Co-op Nation, many electric cooperatives are pursuing and
implementing plans utilizing different models to deploy broadband to
rural America. Through the Recovery Act broadband programs delivered by
the Rural Utilities Service and the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration, 13 cooperatives in nine states received
funding for system designs that included fiber to the home, middle
mile, microwave and wireless technology.
Co-Mo Connect, a subsidiary of Co-Mo Electric Cooperative in
Tipton, Missouri is currently in phase two of a four phase fiber to the
home broadband project to provide service to the consumer members in
its service territory. When complete, Co-Mo's system will include 4,000
miles of fiber across its 2,300 square mile territory which will pass
31,500 homes and businesses, averaging 7.8 customers per mile. Co-Mo
Connect offers tiered subscription packages with symmetrical speeds
ranging from 5 Mbps to 1 Gbps of symmetrical service at competitive
prices ranging from $39.95-$99.95.\7\ When determining how to best
implement a triple play service offering, Co-Mo partnered with another
Missouri provider, Big River Telephone to provide voice service. On the
video side, Co-Mo is working with another cooperative in Missouri to
share equipment and transport expenses. Eventually, Co-Mo intends to
collaborate with other cooperatives in Missouri and surrounding states
to purchase the necessary video equipment and content necessary to
provide an even more competitive video service offering. This
collaborative effort would allow this group of cooperatives to share
the costs of specialized equipment and therefore keep the cost of
service more reasonable for its members. Co-Mo Connect has been
successful in obtaining affordable access to capital for the first two
phases of their project, but because each phase decreases in density it
seeks access to the FCC Connect America Fund to support the more rural
and costly portions of its territories.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ A full description of Co-Mo's project and service packages can
be found at: http://co-mo.net/Co-Mo_Connect/Internet.html.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another example of a cooperative bringing broadband to its members
is Northeast Rural Services, a subsidiary of Northeast Oklahoma
Electric Cooperative. Northeast Rural Services is building a fiber to
the home system throughout its service territory. It is utilizing a
Rural Utilities Service Broadband Loan to finance the system which will
provide triple play services and broadband speeds up to 1 Gbps.
Midwest, and other rural electric cooperatives need your support to
compete for the billions of dollars available to provide broadband in
high cost areas. Midwest and more than 100 other electric cooperatives
filed Expressions of Interest in response to a request by the Federal
Communications Commission to identify if there is interest and ability
for non-traditional providers to deploy broadband in rural, high cost
areas.\8\ The overwhelming response prompted the FCC to move forward
and conduct Rural Broadband Experiments. Any company interested in
providing robust broadband may bid for support at or below what is the
support available to the price-cap carrier serving eligible Census
blocks.\9\ The Commission is actively considering whether or not to
similarly extend the opportunity to compete to areas covered by an
unsuccessful Experiment Application. Rural electric cooperatives like
Midwest are championing an inclusive process. The FCC will consider the
comments of industry, consumers and legislators in conjunction with its
experience in the Rural Broadband Experiments to determine whether or
not to exempt areas where there is a demonstrated competitor from the
Right of First Refusal program described in the 2011 Transformation
Order.\10\ Given the small budget for the Experiments, there could be
many communities potentially eligible to compete for Federal support if
those communities are exempted from the Right of First Refusal and set
for a competitive auction.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

filed on March 14, 2014. Other Expressions of Interest can be found at

The FCC is poised to award almost $20 billion Connect America
funding to support the high cost areas served by the price-cap
companies. This is a once in a generation opportunity to deploy
broadband in rural communities who deserve to be full participants in
our modern economy. Midwest appreciates the efforts of the FCC to
create an inclusive environment where all eligible providers have an
opportunity to compete for support in offering creative solutions and
to close the gap between broadband available in urban and rural areas.
The areas that Midwest and other electric cooperatives serve are
struggling. For the first time in our history, rural America lost
population. Since 2011, net job growth in non-metro areas has been near
zero.\11\ At least one of the contributing factors is the lack of
essential services--like broadband. This notion concerns Agriculture
Secretary Tom Vilsack who stated:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ See USDA ERS Publication Rural America at a Glance, 2013
edition.

Unless we respond and react, the capacity of rural America
and its power and its reach will continue to decline. Rural
America, with a shrinking population, is becoming less and less
relevant to the politics of this country, and we better
recognize that, and we had better begin to reverse it.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\12\ See http://bigstory.ap.org/article/usda-chief-rural-america-
becoming-less-relevant.

In conclusion, cooperatives like Midwest Energy are well suited to
build and maintain broadband networks. We have a wealth of experience
in building regulated utility networks. We aren't asking for a
preferential treatment, just an opportunity to compete. We do not seek
to exclude anyone from the conversation, but we do believe that a
narrow view of the solution may condemn our communities to the wrong
side of the digital divide. I want to repeat this last point: Midwest
advocates for an inclusive opening of opportunity to provide broadband
service to rural counties. The status quo approach is exclusive and
limits opportunity to those who have always received high cost support.
Given the current lack of broadband in rural areas, Midwest strongly
believes that if the Commission and Congress do not open the playing
field to competition, rural America may never have the chance to
experience the educational opportunities, employment prospects and
advanced healthcare that broadband delivers to those lucky enough to
live in low cost, high population centers.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify before this distinguished
Subcommittee. I welcome any questions you may have.
Exhibit A
Midwest Energy Cooperative
Executive Status Update Summary of Project Connect-Rural-Michigan
Midwest Energy Cooperative's (``Midwest'') board of directors has
charged senior management with developing a coalition of allies and
appropriate state and Federal officials to bring high-speed broadband
service to unserved and under-served portions of rural Michigan, in
part, by accessing Federal funding from the Connect America Fund
(``CAF'') and similar funding which, to date, have only been available
to more traditional incumbent entities who have declined to accept much
of the available funds as inconsistent with their business plan. The
result is that high-speed broadband service is today only available in
more populated areas--and large portions of rural America remain
unserved or under-served.
While Midwest's focus is on its service territory in rural
Michigan, its goal is to act as a catalyst to bring high-speed
broadband to unserved and under-served rural America. To date, Midwest
views its allies as including the Utilities Telecom Council (``UTC''),
United States Department of Agriculture--Rural Utilities Service
(``RUS''), the Michigan Electric Cooperative Association (``MECA''),
Michigan Public Service Commission (``MPSC''), the American Farm Bureau
Federation (``AFBF'') and other similarly situated rural electric
cooperatives throughout the country.
Midwest is proceeding with the deployment of a 243 mile fiber
communications ring through utility substations and facilities to
foster a smarter grid. Not only will this fiber ultimately help member
consumers manage their energy use, it will provide the critical
infrastructure required to support broadband deployment.
To date, Midwest has taken the following actions to bring high-
speed broadband to rural Michigan and rural America:

Power System Engineering (www.powersystem.org) was retained
in 2012 to assist in the necessary technical analyses
associated with our fiber communications ring; and Pulse
Broadband, Inc. (www.pulsebroadbandinc.com) was retained in
2013, along with a host of other contractors, to assist with
financial modeling, provisioning of services and deployment of
fiber-to-the-premises (``FTTx'');

Orjiakor lsiogu, former MPSC Chairman and former Chair of
the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners
(``NARUC'') Taskforce on Federalism & Telecommunications, has
been retained to assist in necessary policy analyses and
licensing guidance;

The national law firm, Dykema (Albert Ernst and Shannon
Heim) has been retained to assist with legal input and
regulatory compliance;

Midwest's fiber communications ring represents a $9.5
million investment by the cooperative. Another $53 million is
required to deploy FTTx off that ring to rural un- and under-
served southwest Michigan. Midwest has now been advised by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural Utilities Services, that
electric loans can now be used to invest in fiber deployment to
the home, thus providing a low-cost matching source for CAF
application--assuming smart grid application. Still, access to
CAF will help expedite a solution for residents of Midwest's
rural service footprint;

With respect to advancing the notion that CAF be availed to
others, the Midwest team has met with senior representatives of
the RUS, NRECA, MECA, the MPSC, FCC, NARUC, Pokagon Band of
Potawatomi, AFBF and member organizations, and the Michigan
Governor's office in both Lansing, MI and Washington, D.C. We
have done this solely and in tandem with UTC and its Rural
Broadband Council (``RBC''), a group consisting of more than
100 of the nation's rural electric cooperatives;

Over the past year, Midwest and its allies have met several
times with FCC Commissioners and staff, their Office of
Strategic Planning, Wireline Bureau and IP Transitions Team;

Midwest and its partners have also met with key Members of
Congress as well as the United States Government Accountability
Office (GAO). The GAO has released a series of reports on rural
broadband deployment efforts based, in part, on discussions
with Midwest and others (http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-
409);

On December 10, 2013, in coordinated filings, Midwest and
UTC requested that the FCC initiate proceedings which will
transition access to CAF funds to the country's rural electric
cooperatives and other entities serving rural America. On
January 30th, the FCC issued an Order that includes rural
experiments, inviting interested parties to file expressions of
interest (``EOI'') by March 7, 2014. On March 7, 2014, Midwest
filed an EOI to FCC along with over 100 rural electric
cooperatives. All total, 1,000+ EOIs were filed with the FCC.
The FCC will now evaluate the EOIs, set a budget for rural
experiments, provide application guidance, evaluate
applications and begin funding projects late third quarter;

On February 12h, 2014, Midwest and its partners secured a
resolution from NARUC supporting broader access to CAF by
utilities and other critical infrastructure industries;

Midwest received its permanent competitive local exchange
carrier (``CLEC'') license in March 2014 and a code of conduct
waiver from the MPSC in June 2014. Its application for an
eligible telecommunications carrier (``ETC'') license is in
process;

A soft launch of Midwest's full project is underway,
deploying roughly 21 miles of its communications ring through
two Midwest substations. In addition to assessment of smart
grid potential, Midwest is building 86 miles of fiber to 951
homes and businesses in the area. Even absent a strong
marketing push, our overall take rate is 26% thus far. Service
plans range from 25-100 Mbps down and 10-50 Mbps up for
residential and 25-100 Mbps of symmetrical service for
business. Midwest's service is scalable to a gigabit. Voice-
over-Internet Protocol (``VoIP'') will be provided by Big River
Telephone and video is being evaluated;

In June 2014, the FCC issued a Report and Order, Declaratory
Ruling, Order, Memorandum Opinion and Order, Seventh Order on
Reconsideration, and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (WC
Docket No. 10-90), which should make it easier for utilities to
gain access to Federal funding for rural broadband under CAF;
and

On July 11, 2014, the FCC issued an Order detailing the
process by which entities may apply for a rural experiment.
Applications are due on October 14, 2014. We will be
participating in rural experiment workshops and plan to be
active in commenting on the FNPRM. Additionally, Midwest
intends to apply for rural experiment funding while continuing
to push for equal access to CAF going forward.

This Executive Status Update Summary will be updated periodically
to keep interested parties advised as to progress. Questions should be
directed to either Midwest President and Chief Executive Officer Bob
Hance at 269-445-1091 (
[email protected]
) or Midwest Vice
President, Regulatory Compliance and Community Development Dave Allen

Background
Midwest Energy Cooperative is a member-owned electric utility
serving more than 35,000 residential, agricultural, commercial and
industrial customers in southwestern and southeastern Michigan,
northern Indiana and Ohio. We also provide propane services under the
name Midwest Propane and telecommunications services as Midwest
Connections. In the past, Midwest Connections has provided dial-up and
satellite Internet as well as broadband over power lines (BPL). We are
now fully committed to a next generation fiber solution as we have
found other platforms to be less-reliable and of insufficient capacity
and speed.
Midwest Energy is one of roughly 840 distribution cooperatives
across 47 states providing service to 42 million Americans and 18.5
million businesses, homes, schools, churches, farms, irrigation systems
and other establishments. As an industry, we own and maintain 42% of
the nation's distribution lines. That said, only 12% of Americans are
customers of ours. Whereas publicly owned utilities (municipals)
average 48 consumers per mile and investor-owned utilities average 34
customers per mile, electric cooperatives serve an average of 7.4
members per mile. These are the folks in need of a broadband solution.
Our Project
Plans to advance from automated meter reading (AMR) to the
deployment of automated metering infrastructure (AMI) provided us the
opportunity to explore a smarter grid for our members. In 2012, we
contracted with Power System Engineering, Inc. (www.powersystem.org) to
help us design and engineer a high-speed communications ring through
substations and facilities. The total cost of this 243 mile Midwest-
owned network is $9.5 million. Plans are in place to at least finance
the roughly $6 million portion of the ring that serves our southwest
district through an already-approved United States Department of
Agriculture--Rural Utilities Service (USDA-RUS) work plan loan.
Recognizing the significant potential of this asset, Midwest Energy
contracted with Pulse Broadband (www.pulsebroadbandinc.com) to help us
design a fiber-to-the-premises (FTTx) product. Utilizing the
communications ring as a middle mile backbone, Pulse Broadband designed
a portion of the 1,800 mile bi-directional FTTx open network using
gigabit passive optical network (GPON) electronics. At the appropriate
time, they will assist us in engineering the remainder of our network.
Midwest Energy's system is scalable, possessing the potential for a
gigabit of service to every home or business in our proposed footprint.
Initially, the following plans will be offered:
Residential High-Speed Internet PackagesBasic:                             Up to 20 Mbps downstream and 10 Mbps
upstream $49.95/month
Advanced:                          Up to 50 Mbps downstream and 20 Mbps
upstream $59.95/month
Ultra:                             Up to 100 Mbps downstream and 25 Mbps
upstream $99.95/month                  Business High-Speed Internet PackagesBasic:                             Up to 20 Mbps downstream and 20 Mbps

Ultra:                             Up to 100 Mbps downstream and 50 Mbps
upstream $199.95/month
Unlimited Local and Long Distance Telephone within the U.S.,
Canada, Dominican Republic, Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico
and Guam. International calling plans and other features are also
available.
Residential:                       Includes three-way calling, caller ID
(number), call ID blocking, call
return, call forwarding, call
waiting and voice mail. $39.95/month
Business:                          Includes three-way calling, caller ID
(name and number), call forwarding,
hunting and voice mail. $49.95/month
Voice services will be provided through Big River Telephone
(www.bigrivertelephone.com) and video service is under consideration.
Midwest Energy will offer members a $10 double-play discount for
bundling their Internet and telephone services with us.
Midwest Energy serves neither cities nor villages in its proposed
service footprint. In these areas, incumbent Frontier (DSL) and Comcast
(cable) provide voice, data and video. Rural townships in southwest
Michigan are mostly devoid of anything other than satellite and Mobile
WiFi (MiFi). Bloomingdale Communications, a first and second round
stimulus recipient, has deployed fiber in the northern-most, and most-
dense, portion of our service area. Our discussions with them have
uncovered no plans to expand beyond their existing boundaries.
Timetable
Midwest Energy is ``shovel-ready'' with its project. We have
secured a temporary CLEC license from the Michigan Public Service
Commission and will pursue an ETC license and other certifications when
our permanent CLEC is granted in March. We have ``socialized'' our
intent with numerous state and Federal agencies and regulatory bodies
in an effort to be transparent and to learn what is necessary to
operate in this complex arena.
Already, Midwest Energy has deployed roughly 21 miles of our
communications ring through two substations serving areas adjacent to
both Schoolcraft and Edwardsburg, Michigan. In addition to assessment
of smart grid potential, Midwest is evaluating the FTTx potential of
laying 72 miles of fiber to 953 homes and businesses in the area. The
capital requirements for our soft launch are $4,367,452-$1,482,500 in
transmission costs and the balance in FTTx costs. Our first two
``beta'' customers are receiving service from Midwest Energy. One is
testing a 100 Mbps plan and the other is evaluating 20 Mbps.
Midwest Energy's soft launch project allows us to better gauge
member interest and service requirements before full deployment. Full
deployment may take up to 3 years, or more, depending upon the level of
support we receive from potential granting agencies. That said, when
our permanent CLEC license is secured, we plan to add new customers at
a planned, but much more aggressive, pace.
Project Area
Our full deployment area includes eligible portions of Cass, St.
Joseph, Kalamazoo, Van Buren and Berrien Counties in Michigan. In this
area, we estimate there are roughly 24,000 homes and 2,500 businesses.
Midwest Energy serves no cities or villages and instead focuses on
rural townships. As such, member density in this area is below nine per
mile. We believe there to be 80 critical community facilities and
public safety entities, made up of ten schools, seven libraries, 23
medical/healthcare providers, ten public safety entities, one community
college, five community support organizations and 24 governmental
facilities. Additionally, we have one Native American Tribe--The
Pokagon Band of Potawatomi. We are confident many of these entities
will provide project endorsement letters during the application phase
of FCC's rural experiments. One such letter from Mno-Bmadsen, the
Pokagon Band of Potawatomi's economic development arm, is attached as
an example of partnerships we are developing.
Southwest Michigan is defined by agriculture--particularly seed
corn production--and serves as a rural residential haven for those that
work and study at Notre Dame, Western Michigan University and area
community colleges. Additionally, those that work at Fortune 500
companies like Kellogg, Whirlpool and Pfizer tend to live in our
proposed service footprint. Though we were severely impacted by a
recent downturn in the recreational vehicle industry, efforts to foster
an entrepreneurial environment are bearing fruit and area unemployment
figures have moderated somewhat.
Midwest Energy's Midwest Connections intends to provide service to
an area encompassing portions of five counties in southwest Michigan
totaling 1,668.09 square miles. We will work closely with Pulse
Broadband to determine the eligibility of the 42 Census tracts, 169
Census block groups and 8,484 Census blocks within our proposed service
footprint.

Cass County, Michigan--490.06 square miles to be served

11 Census Tracts
46 Census Block Groups
2,319 Census Blocks

Project Need
Our service area--often referred to as ``Michiana'' is losing
population. While the volatile nature of the recreational vehicle
industry in nearby Indiana has created a home-based entrepreneurial
boom; many have chosen to leave southwest Michigan. Seniors are
flocking to where health care is abundantly available and the home-
bound have diminishing options in rural America. Workers are moving
closer to their employers. Young people are seeking entertainment
options and basic services like broadband. Parents, concerned for their
children's educational opportunities, are abandoning schools that are
limited in services they provide. Rather than placing further stress on
urban infrastructure, one solution might be to provide broadband where
it either doesn't exist or exists in limited scope. If workers can be
productive at home, that is good for America. If young people can
innovate, we all benefit. America's future truly depends on closing a
digital divide that exists on both a micro (urban versus rural) level
and a macro (U.S. versus the world) level as well.
Within Midwest Energy's proposed footprint, residents, schools,
libraries, farmers, first-responders, healthcare providers and the
Pokagon Band of Potawatomi are seeking an affordable, reliable and
high-speed option. This has provided us tremendous opportunity to
leverage our investment. For instance, USDA-RUS has stepped up to the
plate in helping us finance the cost of our communications ring. Merit
Networks, Inc., a nonprofit, member-owned organization formed in 1966
to design and implement a computer network between public universities
in Michigan, continues to seek a partnership with Midwest Energy. They
view us as being a catalyst in helping them reach schools and libraries
in the region. The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi's economic development
arm--Mno-Bmadsen--is evaluating partnership opportunities that can help
us extend service to their members and we're actively engaged with both
Michigan Farm Bureau and the American Farm Bureau to help bring
broadband to America's farmland. There is little scarcity in leveraging
opportunities for this project and we are exploring them all.
The Ask
Midwest Energy continues to refine its project requirements. As
mentioned, we are financing our communications ring for smart grid
applications through a USDA-RUS work plan loan. Should we fully deploy
our ring, the cost will be $9.5 million. It is $6.075 million if
construct communications in only our southwest district. Our FTTx
capital expenditure requirements are, roughly, $54.2 million. Given the
24,000 homes and 2,500 businesses passed, we will need approximately
$2,045 per passing to fully fund this project. That said, our financial
model continues to be refined and we'll have solid, defensible numbers
to present in our application. These numbers will be in the form of a
one-time capital expenditure. We are not seeking an ongoing subsidy
from the FCC. Midwest Energy will, of course, review FCC financial
models to ensure our numbers are both reasonable and appropriate.
In recent financial modeling, Midwest Energy assumed a 40% take
rate for residential and 30% take rate for commercial. This translates
into 10,350 customers. Applying standard price points for triple-play,
projected net income goes positive in year 4 at a fifty percent equity
injection. Midwest believes fifty percent equity funding is needed to
protect company asset-to-equity ratios. That said, we'll apply only for
what is eligible and what is required to be successful in providing up
to a gigabit of service for rural southwest Michigan.
Total Estimated Project Cost:        $63.7 million

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Hance, and we move now to our
last panelist, Mr. Christopher Guttman-McCabe, Executive Vice
President, CTIA--The Wireless Association here in Washington.
Mr. Guttman-McCabe, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER GUTTMAN-McCABE,
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CTIA--THE WIRELESS
ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON, D.C.

Mr. Guttman-McCabe. Thank you, and good morning, Chairman
Crawford, Ranking Member Costa, and Congressman Thompson. I
appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing.
My name is Christopher Guttman-McCabe, and I serve as
Executive Vice President at CTIA--The Wireless Association.
Today, American wireless users sit at the epicenter of the
wireless broadband revolution. Driven by vibrant competition,
massive investment, and successful light-touch regulation, the
U.S. wireless industry has deployed fourth-generation wireless
technology at a rapid pace and now offers this world-class
service to 95 percent of the American people. In fact, despite
being home to just five percent of the world's wireless
subscribers, the United States claims 45 percent of the world's
4G users.
As a result of the near ubiquitous deployment of 4G
technologies, a growing number of Americans have chosen to
abandon traditional telephone service and go wireless-only. In
fact, during the second 6 months of 2013, two in every five
U.S. households did not have a landline telephone but did have
at least one wireless telephone. And nowhere, Mr. Chairman, is
this more true than in Arkansas, where almost \1/2\ of the
adult population lives in wireless-only households.
Similarly, an estimated 45 million Americans use their
wireless device as their primary on-ramp to the Internet. As
wireless networks have become more ubiquitous, reliable, and
robust, they have become building blocks upon which other
segments of the economy rely to innovate and drive more
efficient outcomes in their respective fields. This is
certainly true in agriculture.
Whether through the use of GPS-assisted technology or
terrestrial wireless sensor technology, wireless is helping to
provide farmers with real-time feedback on a number of
different crop and site variables. This data helps to drive
increased efficiency and improve yields. Onboard telematics
powered by wireless guide farm equipment to reduce time in the
field and cut fuel costs while simultaneously reducing
maintenance costs and time lost to repairs.
Just as many of us rely on mobile apps to check a sports
score or bank balance, agricultural professionals are using
apps to perform a variety of tasks, including to access farm
and field information, check market prices, track cattle, and
even help consumers locate locally grown farm products.
Commercial wireless networks stand behind each of these
activities. Wireless is an increasingly important part of rural
communities and not only for those involved in agriculture.
Rural consumers and businesses of all sizes benefit from access
to competitive services and world-class devices as CTIA's
members invest to bring cutting-edge wireless service to rural
America.
While we are excited about helping U.S. agriculture and
rural America thrive, we are just scratching the surface of
what is possible. But building on these advances requires the
right policies here in Washington. America's farmers may not
know that they care about the intricacies of spectrum
allocation, the challenges of tower siting, or the impact of
FCC regulation, but they do. This is true because the ability
to deliver the sorts of services on which the farming and
agriculture community is relying depends on the wireless
industry having access to spectrum and the ability to build the
networks needed to put it to use, without the burdens of
unnecessary regulation.
Spectrum is the key input into the wireless business. For
us, it is the oxygen that fuels everything else. For this
reason, ensuring that a sufficient, predictable supply of
spectrum for commercial use is at the top of CTIA's agenda.
Thanks to Congress' work in the 2012 Middle Class Tax Relief
and Job Creation Act, there are two upcoming auctions that will
bring additional spectrum to market for CTIA's members.
Congress must encourage the FCC to do everything necessary
to ensure that these critical auctions are successful and on
schedule.
Once spectrum has been auctioned, it must be put to work.
That means that networks must be deployed. To facilitate this,
the FCC must complete work on its wireless infrastructure
proceeding which is flowing from the 2012 law that authorized
the auctions.
Finally, policymakers must continue to support a light-
touch regulatory regime for wireless. Wireless is different
than the other communications and broadband technologies.
Wireless has benefited from a comparative lack of regulation
over the last 20 years, and the results validate the efficacy
of this approach. Our world-leading environment is no accident.
Regulators thus should not try to prejudge how the wireless
industry will evolve or impose upon it rules designed for
wireline networks in a monopoly environment. Similarly,
policymakers should not bias the FCC's Universal Service
Programs or the Rural Utilities Service Loan Programs in favor
of any particular technology. Consumer preference, not
government fiat, should guide network deployment decisions.
Thank you again for the opportunity to participate in
today's hearing. I look forward to working with the
Subcommittee to advance the deployment of wireless service
across all of America. Thank you.

Wireless is an increasingly important part of rural communities,
and not only for those involved in agriculture. Rural consumers and
businesses of all sizes benefit from access to competitive services and
world-class devices. CTIA's carrier members, large and small, are
investing to bring cutting-edge wireless service to rural communities.
In addition to the widespread deployment of LTE described above, these
initiatives include AT&T's planned deployment of fixed wireless service
that uses advanced technology, dedicated spectrum, and professional

upcoming auctions that will bring additional spectrum to market for
CTIA's members.\13\ These auctions are critical to meeting the
burgeoning demand for wireless broadband, which Ericsson \14\ and Cisco
\15\ suggest will continue, and to maintaining the United States'
position as the world's leader in advanced wireless services. Congress
therefore must encourage the Federal Communications Commission to do
everything necessary to ensure that these auctions are successful and
on schedule.

Once spectrum has been auctioned, it must be put to work. That
means that networks must be deployed. To facilitate the deployment of
wireless network infrastructure, industry needs a predictable,
expedited process for seeking siting approvals. This is true for the
construction of towers, as well as for the process of deploying
antennae on existing towers or structures and for the use of small cell
technologies. New cell sites can expand the available coverage area for
consumers, and increase a network's ability to provide the kinds of
services consumers want and expect. To support these efforts, the
Federal Communications Commission must complete work on its Wireless
Infrastructure proceeding,\16\ which flowed from the 2012 law
authorizing the auctions. Additionally, because towers have to connect
to the larger network, Congress and the Federal Communications
Commission must continue to work to remove barriers to the deployment
of fiber infrastructure.

Finally, with the right spectrum and siting policies in place,
policymakers must continue to support a light-touch regulatory regime
for wireless. Wireless has benefited from a comparative lack of
regulation over the last twenty years, and the resulting deployment and
consistent technological advancement validate the efficacy of this
approach. Regulators thus should not try to prejudge how the wireless

preference, not government fiat, should guide network deployment
decisions. Vibrant competition and regulatory humility will produce the
best outcomes for consumers.

Thank you again for the opportunity to participate in today's
hearing. CTIA looks forward to working with the Subcommittee to advance
the deployment of wireless service across all of America.

The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Guttman-McCabe, and we will
start our round of questioning. I first recognize myself for 5
minutes. Let me start with Mr. Zimmerman.
In your view, are the various agencies such as USDA and the
FCC coordinating sufficiently in their efforts and in such a
way that might result in a comprehensive and effective plan for
the deployment of broadband in rural America?
Mr. Zimmerman. I missed the first part of your question.
What was that again?
The Chairman. Do you believe that the agencies such as USDA
and FCC are coordinating sufficiently in their efforts----
Mr. Zimmerman. Okay. I can't say how the agencies work back
and forth. The one thing I do know is that the RUS is making
things that will help us as far as loan programs to make the
availability of more broadband, but the regulation that we have
on the FCC side makes it very hard for us to plan and take on
these loans because we are afraid of not being able to pay
them.
The rate floor in particular, jumping to $20.46 while my
local rates are $14, that would be almost a 50 percent rate
increase that they wanted us to do within a 3 month--they gave
us 3 months to get it done. That is just unreasonable for
people to have to get done. It makes it harder for us to keep
people on the network if they keep jacking up the rates that
the people have to pay to be on the network, and it is for a
voice service that a lot of them don't want and makes the
broadband fees higher and higher and unaffordable in rural
areas where they are trying to expand it more.
So that is sort of the side we have been having trouble
with.
The Chairman. Okay. And I have heard this before, so
basically there is a template for--that doesn't allow the
consumer to make the choice between broadband and voice, that
they just kind of are packaged up together, is that correct?
Mr. Zimmerman. That is right. They make the Universal
Service support to the company based on the voice side only,
not the broadband. And people have gone, the voice has gone to
wireless if it is available. And it is not available in all
areas as we know, but if it is, that is where the voice traffic
has migrated to, to tie the support to these rural areas to get
broadband to voice is just an antiquated part of the system,
and it is a detriment because people will not pay the added
expense of having a telephone line. They don't want it, and in
most places they don't need it.
The Chairman. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Cohen, your testimony
highlighted the differences in large and small telecom
providers and mentioned several of the FCC reforms which impact
them separately. Do you feel that the FCC is sufficiently
taking into account the impact on smaller providers?
Mr. Cohen. The FCC is taking into account the impact on
small providers, but unfortunately, their timing is behind that
of the impact on large providers so that there is a Universal
Service mechanism designed and implemented for the large
providers. As I mentioned in my testimony, at the beginning of
2015, they will be able to elect whether to receive CAF II
funding. After that the remaining CAF II funding in the areas
not elected will be open to all comers.
On the small-company side, the small companies, as Mr.
Zimmerman mentioned, are still dealing with the Universal
Service mechanism that was made and designed for the voice era,
and now we are in the broadband era. And so the FCC needs to
both address the issue of broadband-only lines, as Mr.
Zimmerman pointed out, and ensure that they receive support but
also modernize the Universal Service program for small
companies so that he can have a predictable source of revenue
from Universal Service which will enable them to plan, borrow
from RUS and other lenders, and invest in broadband to extend
and improve the availability of that service in rural America.
The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Cohen. Mr. Hance, your
cooperative and others like it pretty much are the tip of the
spear in broadband, and that is kind of how you want to lead
the charge. How do you choose which areas make the most sense
for you to serve?
Mr. Hance. The best way to answer that question is to say
each of the co-ops are taking their own projects under their
own advisement, and the way most of us are approaching it and
not speaking for everyone is trying to concentrate on those
areas where we have the highest concentration of meters. It is
hard to say in the landscape that we serve. We, at our system,
serve about nine members per mile line. In our most dense areas
it might be up towards 15. So we concentrate on those areas
where we have the best opportunity to get the most dense first,
with the idea that we will reach out to all of our members
eventually.
The Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Guttman-McCabe, you mentioned
the shift away from landline subscriptions to wireless
solutions. Can you talk a little bit more about how the
wireless and backhaul networks are connected and what it takes
to expand both wireline and wireless coverage?
Mr. Guttman-McCabe. Certainly, Mr. Chairman, and at the
core of my testimony is the notion that the country is evolving
pretty significantly as we speak. More and more people are
moving to wireless only. More and more people are using
wireless as their access point to the Internet. We are hearing
more stories about mHealth, mobile health and mobile education,
and part of our concern is that we are not entirely sure that
the government programs are aware or at least take into
consideration this evolution. At the same time that the FCC is
reforming its USF fund, its Universal Service Fund, it is
significantly reducing the amount of money that goes to mobile
broadband. And for us, yes, there certainly is an integration
between the use of mobile broadband and backhaul, but we
believe that whether it is the RUS programs or the Connect
America Fund Phase II that there needs to be some technology
neutrality that allows consumers in essence to make the choice.
If there is enough need or desire in an unserved market for
wireless service, then the providers in those areas should be
able to get access to these funds, particularly as we see this
evolution. I am fearful that we are going to continue to miss
what is becoming just such a tremendous tidal wave of change in
the United States towards mobile use. Mobile broadband doubled
in size for the fourth year in a row, mobile broadband usage,
the amount of megabits of usage and it is sort of outpacing all
the predictions of 5 years ago of where it was going to be. And
I am fearful that some of the programs that we are talking
about today, whether it is the RUS Loan Program or the Connect
America Fund Phase II or even the Mobility Fund where the
Commission is contemplating taking a mobility fund that went
from north of a billion down to $500 million. They are
contemplating reducing that even further. And I am sure you
have areas, particularly road miles in your districts, that
aren't served that could use some--the carriers in those areas
could use some support. Our carriers are working hard to get
their large and small markets, but having a technology-neutral
program, set-up programs, would really help to facilitate both
again the intersection of broadband backhaul from the wired
constituents as well as wireless broadband service from my
constituents.
The Chairman. Thank you. I now recognize the Ranking Member
for 5 minutes.
Mr. Costa. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Guttman-
McCabe, I listened carefully to your final comments, sir. Are
you saying that you think that the Connect America Fund creates
an unlevel playing field as it relates to----
Mr. Guttman-McCabe. Certainly at least as it is being
considered. There are some concerns we have with some of either
the latency requirements or the requirements on the size or the
amount of capacity that a company that receives the funds has
to deliver that doesn't recognize the technology differences
with a mobile network.
Mr. Costa. And you can substantiate that?
Mr. Guttman-McCabe. Well, I mean, certainly we have put on
the record some of those concerns, and again, we are putting
them on again on the record very soon.
Mr. Costa. Mr. Cohen, can you clarify what you think you
believe that the Connect America Fund should play in providing
subsidies for broadband as we try to expand deployment
throughout rural America?
Mr. Cohen. Yes, the Connect America Fund is designed to
provide support for areas that make no economic sense without
some support. Congress has indicated to the FCC that they
wanted the budget for that fund unlimited. The FCC limited that
budget to $4.5 billion per year. The FCC is very carefully
allocating those funds. They are ensuring that they go to
provide the type of services that----
Mr. Costa. And so your assessment, how do you think that is
all working?
Mr. Cohen. Well, right now we are still in the
implementation stage of the portion of the fund for price-cap
areas, and that is moving along, and we will see over the next
12 months how CAF II is implemented which will provide that
election for the price-cap carriers and then the subsequent
auction. The areas served by----
Mr. Costa. So a lot of time----
Mr. Cohen.--the small companies, the rate-of-return
carriers, unfortunately the Connect America Fund has not really
been designed for them for broadband.
Mr. Costa. And so then you think that is a gap?
Mr. Cohen. Absolutely. The FCC needs to promptly move along
and support broadband-only lines and develop a predictable
broadband-oriented program for small companies.
Mr. Costa. And you talked a lot about in your testimony the
price-cap carriers----
Mr. Cohen. Yes.
Mr. Costa.--and how it is across the country impacting on a
state-by-state basis. So if a state's service area goes to an
auction process, this can pretty much go to any geographical
area?
Mr. Cohen. Yes. The price-cap carrier in a particular state
presumably by the end of the year, which the FCC has indicated
that is their schedule----
Mr. Costa. Are you concerned that there may be cherry-
picking as a result of that?
Mr. Cohen. Well, no. The price-cap companies will be
offered an election to elect the state as a whole their entire
service area in a state to receive support. If they decide not
to elect that funding, that area is opened up to an auction,
and various providers of any sort can bid to provide service in
particular areas in the state.
Mr. Costa. Do you think the FCC should reconsider how Phase
II should work and whether or not those who are participating
in the right of first refusal or whether or not that should be
skipped altogether?
Mr. Cohen. The FCC made the considered decision to
accelerate broadband to rural consumers who have waited in many
instances a very long time for it by providing for the right of
first refusal which allows the price-cap carriers that have
facilities in these rural areas to add onto those facilities
and improve those facilities to be able to provide broadband.
But they also provided a competitive opportunity for others in
areas where the price-cap companies do not elect to accept the
CAF II money and the obligations to anybody else to apply in
the auction, to bid in the auction.
Mr. Costa. Do you think the FCC has dragged its feet in
this area? I hear it has taken over 3 years.
Mr. Cohen. Certainly the process has taken longer than
anybody, including the FCC, has anticipated. But it appears
that we are now reaching the conclusion of the process, and
money should be flowing next year.
Mr. Costa. So are you hopeful?
Mr. Cohen. I am very hopeful that the Commission will
continue their prompt implementation of the CAF II Program, and
rural consumers will soon be receiving the benefits of
broadband service.
Mr. Costa. The ultimate goal, universal broadband?
Mr. Cohen. Absolutely.
Mr. Costa. Thank you.
The Chairman. I thank the gentleman. Now I recognize the
gentleman from Pennsylvania for 5 minutes. Mr. Thompson, you
are recognized.
Mr. Thompson. Mr. Chairman, thank you so much. Thanks for
putting this Subcommittee hearing together, incredibly
important issue. Recently I had the opportunity to be with a
group, a coalition of folks who, every 2 years, publish the Why
Rural Matters study, it is just a great study. And it was
interesting to see the fact that we are actually growing the
number of youth in rural American with this last biannual
report. They have been doing it for some time now, about 13
years or more. But this past report that covers the past 2
years shows rural youth increasing proportionately higher than
in urban America. And between that and the economic impact, I
mean, the importance of this hearing is so significant,
obviously, providing access to broadband. To all four of the
witnesses, thank you, gentlemen, for your respective areas of
leadership and expertise.
I want to start with Mr. Zimmerman. In your testimony, you
at one point discussed how rural telecom has been at the
forefront of innovation, specifically in terms of converting to
digital systems and now to wireless networks. With technology
costs evolving so quickly, what kinds of impacts, either
challenges or benefits, has this continued technological
innovation had on rural access, development, and infrastructure
and also any thoughts on what we may see for future
innovations?
Mr. Zimmerman. Yes, sir. One of the big changes is to be
able to get the increasing levels of broadband out to the rural
areas. We have been able to get DSL speeds which is basically
1.5 Meg to 98 percent of our territory. That is increasingly
being seen as not enough or insufficient, and one of the things
that we struggle with is to be able to upgrade these networks.
And one of the bottlenecks have been we are geographically
isolated, and the way to get to the backbone of the Internet
has basically been through larger carriers such as AT&T or
Century to get traffic out of those rural areas to the
backbone, and a lot of times we had trouble getting the
capacity we needed. So we have gone out on our own with the
help of RUS to build some fiber networks of our own so we could
connect to the backbone ourselves. So that has been one of the
best things that we have been able to get done and one of the
things we continue to work on to expand the capacity because
the needs keep going up.
Mr. Thompson. I know it is a crystal ball, but innovation
continues, obviously in particular this area. I open up this
question to the panel. Any thoughts of what innovations we may
see next coming out that will help to increase cost-effective
access?
Mr. Guttman-McCabe. Well, I guess I will dive first,
Congressman. You know, we are seeing deployment of LTE which is
our fourth-generation technology happening at a rate that far
surpasses the other evolution or introductions of our
technologies. And what that is doing is opening up the doors to
a range of services that I don't think any of us could
contemplate. I wrote a law review article on telemedicine 18
years ago. I wouldn't have guessed that most of the evolution
in telemedicine would be in mobile health and that some of the
technologies to deal with long-term health problems would be
happening in rural areas.
One of our rural providers, one of our regional providers
serves through Wisconsin and some of the really rural areas in
there, and they are one of the leaders on putting together
mobile health solutions for diabetics.
So we are seeing these sort of capabilities that are
flowing from next-generation technologies, next-generation
networks that we couldn't have thought, whether it is--I did a
search on apps for agriculture, and I just saw the top 14 apps
of 2014 and it is pretty staggering what those apps can do.
And so whether it is across agriculture or education or
mobile health or banking, I mean, this sort of can go on and
on. The things that are happening in the mobile broadband space
are really life-altering and pretty staggering considering
where we were 5 years ago.
Mr. Thompson. And just to follow-up to one of your
testimony, you had stated in your testimony--because consumer
preference, not government fiat should guide the network
deployment decisions. You know, what actions do you think
just--we are just about out of time--what actions do you think
should be taken to ensure that we allow the markets to work
their will?
Mr. Guttman-McCabe. If we look at USF as an example,
setting a framework or parameters that don't out of the gate
foreclose mobile access would be key. So if you choose latency
or sort of the total capability in terms of the amount of
megabits that can be delivered in a month and those are not
capable on wireless networks, you foreclosed wireless
providers, large, small, urban, rural, from getting access to
those funds. That is a simple one, recognizing that wireless is
different, that there are significant benefits to the ability
to have mobility, benefits to having greater capacity and
greater throughput of a landline service as well, but there are
real benefits to mobility and consumers are making that choice
all the time.
Mr. Thompson. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired. I thank the
gentleman, and I recognize the gentlelady from New Mexico, Ms.
Lujan Grisham for 5 minutes.
Ms. Lujan Grisham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning,
everyone. Mr. Zimmerman, as a representative from a very rural
state, I certainly understand the challenges in providing
services to rural areas, and I experienced these firsthand. My
notes say Secretary of Health, but I served in state government
for 17 years and was responsible for aging and disability
services and then also all of the public health services. And
part of the problem in getting out our direct services and
providing access was certainly making sure that we had
broadband Internet access, and it is something that rural and
frontier states still really struggle with today. And I am just
going to sort of give you some facts. We know that 77 percent
of rural counties face a serious shortage of health
professionals and an even greater shortage of medical
specialists. This means that 51 million Americans that live in
rural America must travel greater distances, face longer waits,
and usually spend more money than people in urban areas for the
same care.
So in New Mexico, to combat this trend, a gentleman by the
name of Dr. Sanjeev Aurora, a professor at the University of
New Mexico, created a project, a program called ECHO, and it
stands for the Extension for Community Health Outcomes. And
what it does is it provides specialty care to rural residents
by connecting their primary care docs with specialists. In this
way folks with very specific and significant disease issues can
get access using telehealth or telemedicine.
Now it was created in 2003. Since then it has expanded to
more than 30 universities across the country, and it currently
provides assistance to thousands of clinics all over the world.
But it is continuing to provide directly--its impact is focused
in New Mexico, this model. The problem is, it is still, after
2003, there are several areas that we cannot reach. We don't
have the broadband needed to attach a project or a program like
ECHO to, say, Indian Country or the most remote rural
communities.
Higher broadband speeds are needed for telemedicine, as you
know, because, two things. Only 51 percent of the population
has access to broadband download speeds of at least 25 Megabits
as compared to 94 percent of the urban population. But frankly,
more importantly, in telemedicine, if you don't have broadband,
you cannot view most of the diagnostics that are really
enhanced and needed in order to have that relationship between
your medical practitioners between a rural and frontier area
and your urban area where you are connecting the health
professionals for the benefit of the rural patient.
How can policymakers better support small, rural providers
in not only deploying broadband in rural communities but also
making sure that that service can support projects like the one
I described to you, New Mexico ECHO, and telemedicine in a
broader fashion?
Mr. Zimmerman. Well, one of the oddities of this whole
process was that many of the rate-of-return carriers like
myself were able to get a high level of coverage at a basic
speed like I mentioned earlier before of 1.5, and then when the
2011 Order came out, the talk was that the urban areas should
have 100 meg up and 100 down and that the rural areas should
only be able to do 4 meg down and 1 meg up. And that was just a
terrible thing to tell people in the rural areas, that you
should be happy with what you have now but the urban areas are
going to get the big, fast speeds. And that has been a big
issue for us all along, that small companies have done a good
job of getting some basic coverage out there to which we
continue to beef up, and it seems like the regulation going on
now is more towards the price-cap carriers to let them get some
areas that are not covered caught up with. But we don't think
areas like rural New Mexico where my aunt lives in Ruidoso or
Arkansas, where I live, should be left out----
Ms. Lujan Grisham. Ruidoso is a big city, sir, big, huge
city.
Mr. Zimmerman. Big city?
Ms. Lujan Grisham. Yes, sir.
Mr. Zimmerman. Well, my other aunt lives in Artesia. That
is a little bit smaller.
Ms. Lujan Grisham. I don't know. Until you have been to
Huerfano or Pie Town, I am not sure. You are still talking
about big cities.
Mr. Zimmerman. Okay. Okay. Well, I thought I had a shot
there.
Ms. Lujan Grisham. And I appreciate that, but where I am
struggling, Mr. Chairman, and with the panel--I appreciate
everyone's presence today--is that what we are currently using
isn't enough to incentivize and develop broadband high-speed
access in the places that we really need it. And without it,
not only are we not investing appropriately in the ag community
but broader in things like--and we are spending those and
paying for those in USDA, appropriations and grants--but
telemedicine can't be connected where we want it to because it
can only do the counseling services, Mr. Chairman. It can't do
the diagnostic aspects unless we find a way to have broad-based
coverage.
I really challenge us to find those appropriate incentives
and balances to make this really accessible across the country.
The Chairman. I thank the gentlelady.
Ms. Lujan Grisham. I yield back.
The Chairman. And the gentlelady yields. I am pleased to
recognize the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Rogers, for 5
minutes.
Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Zimmerman, you
indicated in your earlier testimony that you are currently
using 10 Gigabyte network. In the recent farm bill, a provision
was included to create a pilot program to accomplish that same
goal. Do you still think we need that pilot program to go
forward?
Mr. Zimmerman. Absolutely.
Mr. Rogers. Also under the Recovery--tell me why.
Mr. Zimmerman. Well, I think that is where the backbone
needs to be. We have big areas of Arkansas that need to be
connected that have been connected through a B Top Grant to
connect the 4 year and 2 year colleges and the health centers,
and that is where the 10 gigabyte network is to connect the big
data centers.
As far as getting out into rural mom-and-pop homes, we
don't need 10 gigabytes out there whatsoever. But to be able to
get these isolated parts of Arkansas or perhaps Alabama, to get
them the network capacity to feed the entire neighborhood or
the entire district, you need to have a big pipe going out of
there that needs to be able to have that capacity.
Mr. Rogers. I like that perhaps Alabama part.
Mr. Zimmerman. Perhaps. Not necessarily.
Mr. Rogers. I think it should be Alabama, perhaps Arkansas.
That would be good.
Mr. Zimmerman. Okay.
Mr. Rogers. In the Recovery Act, USDA obligated $3.4
billion at a rate of over $17,000 per line. Can you share your
experiences expanding networks and how that basic average
compares to the cost you have faced connecting these networks?
Mr. Zimmerman. What was the top number you had?
Mr. Rogers. It was $3.4 billion.
Mr. Zimmerman. No, I meant per line.
Mr. Rogers. It was $17,000 per line.
Mr. Zimmerman. Okay. That must be in rural Alaska somewhere
because that is really, really high. Obviously the cost to
maintain what is called the local loop from our office to
somewhere way out in the county is going to be high. In
Arkansas, probably in the $80 to $150 per loop cost, and again,
we have rates of about $14. People would never pay that kind of
rate to pay $80 to $130. So it has always been--there has been
support to make the rural customers have comparable services at
comparable rates, and that has been in the law since the
Communications Act of 1934. So it is very important.
Mr. Rogers. Well, talking about making these connections,
geographic challenges such as hard soil and rough terrain can
inhibit the build-out of these networks. How do you overcome
those in your experience?
Mr. Zimmerman. Rock hammers.
Mr. Rogers. What was that?
Mr. Zimmerman. Rock hammers. If when we put in fiber, we
don't want to put it up in the air because we have tornados, we
have ice storms, and utilities up in the air are very, very
vulnerable to weather. So we have gone in and buried these
fibers. In north Arkansas, the rock is about 6" to 18" above
the surface, and you have to rock tile that thing in and it is
a very expensive project to do.
Mr. Rogers. How hard is it to maintain given that
difficulty?
Mr. Zimmerman. Luckily being buried and put in conduit, it
is pretty protected there. And we have networks that we can
trace where the problem is if something gets cut. We had a
funny thing happen in Mountain View, Arkansas. A farmer had a
dog die. Took his backhoe out to bury the dog, cut our fiber,
and we couldn't find where it was. And you have those kind of
strange things happen to buried fiber, but it is not as
vulnerable as something up in the air.
Mr. Rogers. He really wanted to bury that dog if he had to
use a rock hammer.
Mr. Zimmerman. That is right.
Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
The Chairman. I thank the gentleman. I appreciate the panel
for being here today. We are going to close and wrap up. Before
we do, I want to thank Ms. Lujan Grisham. She is filling in for
the Ranking Member who has departed to participate in another
committee hearing.
And just in closing before we dismiss, I just want to again
thank you. And it seemed like the recurring theme in your oral
testimony was the USF issue and bringing that sort of
modernizing that, bringing it into the modern age. That is safe
to say? I think all four of you referred to that in some detail
in each of your opening comments. And so we will work hard on
that among the other issues that you have detailed. We
appreciate you being here.
I would also like to say that under the rules of the
Committee, the record of today's hearing will remain open for
10 calendar days to receive additional material and
supplementary written responses from the witnesses to any
questions posed by a Member of the Subcommittee on Livestock,
Rural Development, and Credit. The hearing is now adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:38 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
[Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:]
Supplementary Information Submitted by John C. Padalino, Administrator,
Rural Utilities Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture
Mr. Costa. So let me make a suggestion. I think that is all
good, but the Members of this Subcommittee, and maybe it is
something staff could work with the Members of the full
Committee, but it would be nice if we had a listing of--I don't
know if the number is 255 or whatever you stated earlier--these
projects that are currently ongoing so that we could know those
that are in our respective Congressional districts, and we
could help complement your efforts to say, ``Look. You are on a
timeline here, and you need to do everything you can to
expedite it so that you are able to complete the project,''
because that would--certainly we would like to know. I don't
think any of us would like to find a situation where next March
we have our local telephone company calling us and saying, ``We
are \2/3\ done with our project, but we are not going to
complete it until August, and they are telling us now we are
going to run out of their money. What can you do to help us?''
The Chairman. If the gentleman would yield, clarification
between grants and loans? If we could have that as well on
those 255 projects that you mentioned because that
clarification would be helpful as well. And if you could make a
distinction? I understand a grant is obviously different than a
loan, but are we going to see that funding unavailable for
loans that have already been made as well, or can they reapply
at some point if in fact they didn't meet that timeline?
Mr. Padalino. I thank you for your offer, and we really
appreciate the assistance and will be happy to work with the
staff on providing that information.

Per Mr. Costa and Mr. Crawford's requests at the hearing, I am
attaching two items that should be useful and informative. The first is
a 2011 BIP award report (Advancing Broadband--A Foundation for Strong
Rural Communities, January 2011). Though it is from 2011, it contains
all the relevant info on the awards, which is what Mr. Crawford was
looking for, and it contains a good description of each. In addition, I
am also attaching an excel sheet that lists out the projects, total
award, total project budget, and status.

Message from the Administrator
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Utilities Service
(RUS) is the Federal leader in delivering key utilities systems--
telecommunications, electricity, water and wastewater, and now 21st
century high-speed broadband services--to remote underserved and
unserved communities in rural America. Now, in expanding 21st century
high-speed broadband services to farms, schools, public safety
facilities, and other institutions in rural communities, the impact of
RUS initiatives will be experienced more broadly across the country.
Beginning in 1935, RUS's predecessor, the Rural Electrification
Administration, helped bring electricity to rural America and was the
driving force behind telephone service being introduced in the same
remote areas, starting in 1949.
Since 1994, RUS required federally funded telecommunications
projects to be broadband capable. In 2002, Congress created a broadband
loan program to pave the way for an Internet infrastructure of the
future. With the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, RUS
assumed a leading role in stimulating the economy, creating jobs, and
bringing opportunity to rural Americans by investing more than $3.5
billion to expand broadband networks that will close the digital divide
between rural and urban communities. The Recovery Act also invested
$3.27 billion in rural water and waste disposal systems to further
bolster rural infrastructure.
RUS is applying its extensive technical skills, program experience,
and financial expertise gained over 75 years to the new challenge of
deploying the most advanced broadband capability in rural communities.
USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack has recognized broadband as a pillar of his
strategy to revitalize rural America. Since passage of the Recovery
Act, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Commerce and other
Federal agencies, RUS has ensured valuable resources are distributed
effectively and efficiently, as Congress intended.
In September 2010, RUS completed the awards phase of the Broadband
Initiatives Program (BIP). This report summarizes the BIP awards made
to advance congressional directives and confirms the Obama
Administration's commitment to improving rural connectivity and
enhancing the quality of life for rural families and businesses. These
investments in broadband will connect nearly 7 million rural Americans,
along with more than 360,000 businesses and more than 30,000 critical
community institutions like schools, healthcare facilities, and public
safety agencies, to new or improved service.
These investments not only will benefit rural areas, but also will
contribute to our economic growth as a Nation. Through this program,
RUS is generating urgently needed jobs to construct these new networks.
Once built, they will provide the platform for economic development and
job creation for years to come.

Jonathan Adelstein,
Administrator,
Rural Utilities Service.
Investing in Rural America
Rural areas with dispersed populations or demanding terrain
generally have difficulty attracting broadband service providers
because the fixed cost of delivering broadband service can be too high.
Yet broadband is a key to economic growth. For rural businesses,
broadband gives access to national and international markets and
enables new, small, and home-based businesses to thrive. Broadband
access provides rural residents with the connectivity they need to
obtain healthcare, education, and many essential goods and services.
The Recovery Act authorized RUS to issue loans and grants to
projects that extend broadband service to unserved and underserved
rural areas. The funding provided by the Recovery Act is increasing the
availability of broadband and stimulating both short- and long-term
economic progress. RUS completed two BIP funding rounds, making a
significant investment in projects that will enhance broadband
infrastructure in scores of rural communities.
This represents a critical investment, designed to rebuild and
revitalize rural communities. Without this funding, many communities
could not cover the costs of providing broadband service to homes,

Infrastructure Awards
RUS awarded $3.4 billion to 297 recipients in 45 States and 1 U.S.
territory for infrastructure projects. Eighty-nine percent of the
awards and 92 percent of the total dollars awarded are for 285 last-
mile projects ($3.25 billion), which will provide broadband service to
households and other end users. Four percent of the awards and 5
percent of the total dollars awarded are for 12 middle-mile projects
($173 million) that will provide necessary backbone services such as
interoffice transport, backhaul, Internet connectivity, or special
access to rural areas.
The projects funded will bring broadband service to 2.8 million
households, reaching nearly 7 million people, 364,000 businesses, and
32,000 anchor institutions across more than 300,000 square miles. These
projects also overlap with 31 tribal lands and 124 persistent poverty
counties.
The projects will create more than 25,000 immediate and direct
jobs. Although the long-term impact these projects will have on
fostering job creation in these communities is difficult to estimate,
the projects are expected to contribute to the long-term economic
development opportunities in each rural community where a broadband
project is launched. Data provided by the U.S. Department of Education
show that more than 1 million K-12 students attend school within areas
served by BIP awards. More than 100 colleges and technical schools are
located in areas served by BIP awards. Data provided by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services show that nearly 600 rural
healthcare facilities are located in areas served by BIP awards.
Sixtyfive (11 percent) of these facilities will receive broadband for
the first time as a result of BIP.
