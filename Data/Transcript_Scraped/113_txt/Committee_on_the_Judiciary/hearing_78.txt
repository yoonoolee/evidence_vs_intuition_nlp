Over-Criminalization Task Force of 2014

Committee on the Judiciary

Washington, DC.

The Task Force met, pursuant to call, at 9:30 a.m., in room
2237, Rayburn Office Building, the Honorable F. James
Sensenbrenner, Jr. (Chairman of the Task Force) presiding.
Present: Representatives Sensenbrenner, Bachus, Gohmert,

Prepared Statement of the Honorable F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr., a
Representative in Congress from the State of Wisconsin, and Chairman,
Over-Criminalization Task Force of 2014

Good morning and welcome to the sixth hearing of the Judiciary
Committee's Over-Criminalization Task Force. Over its first 6 months of
existence, the Task Force conducted an in-depth evaluation of the over-
criminalization problem. One month ago, the Task Force held its first
hearing since re-authorization, focusing on Criminal Code Reform--a
topic of particular interest to me.
Our work continues today, as the Task Force will consider the issue
of the ``over-federalization'' of criminal law. This issue has been of
interest to the over-criminalization movement since at least 1998, when
the American Bar Association convened a blue-ribbon panel to examine
``over-federalization.'' However, its origins date back to this
country's Founding. The Framers, in their wisdom, created a federal
government of limited, enumerated powers, and reserved all powers not
expressly conferred on the federal government to the states. Indeed,
the Supreme Court has repeatedly articulated that Congress possesses no
general police power--and that, in the federal system, the states
possess primary authority for defining and enforcing criminal
sanctions.
In the criminal justice context, this means that, in practice, the
vast majority of criminal prosecutions occur at the state, rather than
the federal level. This is borne out by the oft-cited fact that state
prosecutors handle approximately 95% of the criminal prosecutions in
any given year. Nevertheless, there is no question that, over the past
few decades, Congress has created new federal statutes criminalizing
conduct that occurs largely intra-state. We know this because, as
Members of the Task Force and witnesses before us have repeatedly
stated, an estimated 4,500 crimes currently exist in the United States
Code--and this number includes a number of ``street-level'' crimes like
carjacking. That statute is one of many that some have argued ought to
be the exclusive province of state governments to combat.
We also know that the federal government employs a surprisingly
large number of federal agents with firearm and arrest authority, and
many have pointed to this as indicative of the ``over-federalization''
of crime. As far back as September 2008--prior to the Obama
Administration--federal agencies employed approximately 120,000 full-
time law enforcement officers--that is, the equivalent of 40 officers
per 100,000 citizens--all of whom are authorized to make arrests and
carry firearms in the United States. These federal agents work for such
disparate entities as the Veterans Health Administration, the Fish and
Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management.
We have all heard the anecdote about the Fish and Wildlife Service
employing a SWAT team. The IRS has one as well--which should be of
great concern to all of us. I am very concerned about these federal
regulatory agencies exercising law enforcement authority, because it
can only serve to blur the lines between truly criminal and regulatory
conduct and weaken the Founding Fathers' intent that the federal
government play a limited role in criminal enforcement.
The question, then, is whether and to what extent Congress should
act to address this matter. I look forward to hearing from our
distinguished panel about the scope of the over-federalization issue,
and am very interested in your thoughts about corrective measures
Congress might take.
I want to thank the witnesses for appearing today, and look forward
to hearing your perspectives on this important issue.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Scott follows:]

Prepared Statement of the Honorable Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott, a
Representative in Congress from the State of Virginia, and Ranking
Member, Over-Criminalization Task Force of 2014

Our government's greatest power, the conduit by which it can
deprive a citizen of liberty or even life itself, is criminal law.
Aware of this inherent danger, the Framers of our Constitution
enshrined significant safeguards in the Bill of Rights to protect
citizens from unjust criminal proceedings.
Under the Constitution, states have the ``police power'' and should
have primary jurisdiction over crimes. But for the past several
decades, Congress has responded to headlines with knee-jerk federal
criminal legislation, without inquiry into whether the federal
government should be involved at all. In 1998, the American Bar
Association (ABA) Task Force on the Federalization of Criminal Law
revealed a startling fact: More than 40% of the federal criminal
provisions enacted since the Civil War have been enacted since 1970,
largely in matters previously left to the states. Congress was
superimposing federal crimes at record pace on essentially localized
conduct that was already criminalized by the states.
Federalizing crimes traditionally handled in states not only taxes
an already-strained federal court system, but also shifts prosecutorial
priorities, increases selective prosecutions, and undermines state and
local anti-crime efforts. It duplicates state enforcement efforts, at
high cost to the taxpayer, and floods federal courts with cases that do
not belong there, effectively closing federal courthouse doors to
deserving litigants. Defendants have often found themselves subject to
federal and state prosecution for the same act, undermining the Fifth
Amendment protection against double jeopardy. What the Framers were
afraid of is occurring, and overfederalization is largely to blame.
When it comes to criminal law, Congress has abandoned the basic
Constitutional principle of restraint. Matters that can be adequately
handled by states should be left to states, and only those matters that
cannot be so handled should be addressed by the federal government.
When we enact criminal legislation, the issue of ``need'' should be
considered. Is a valid purpose served by creating crimes at the federal
level, particularly if it duplicates crimes at the state level?
For example, why should carjacking be a Federal offense? State and
local law enforcement have been investigating and prosecuting
carjacking since long before Congress made it a Federal crime, and
they've been doing the job quite well. Wouldn't it be better for the
Federal government to provide resources in the form of training,
professional development, use of crime labs, consultation regarding
best practices in law enforcement, etc. in such a situation? These are
the kinds of questions we should be asking before we enact more federal
criminal legislation, and we should scrutinize the laws we already have
accordingly.
Although many members of Congress remain prone to viewing ``tough
on crime'' as the correct response to highly publicized tragedies and
criminal acts, the tide is turning. Bipartisan recognition of the real-
world effects of over-federalization in criminal law is growing across
the political spectrum, from the Heritage Foundation to the ACLU.
It's past time for Congress to rein in its tendency to federalize
criminal law. To that end, let's consider limiting federal criminal
jurisdiction to the following types of cases:

Offenses against the federal government or its
inherent interests

Criminal activity with substantial multi-state or
international aspects

Criminal activity involving complex commercial or
institutional enterprises most effectively prosecuted using federal
resources or expertise

Serious, high-level or widespread state or local
government corruption

Congress regularly insists upon restraint from the Executive and
the Judicial Branches of government, yet often fails to restrain itself
in the area of criminal law. The result has been a waste of tax
dollars, a crippling of the federal courts' ability to fairly
administer criminal and civil justice for all citizens, and an unwise
concentration of law enforcement power in federal agencies.
It's time for us to exercise the same restraint we require in the
other branches of government.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Goodlatte follows:]

Prepared Statement of the Honorable Bob Goodlatte, a Representative in
Congress from the State of Virginia, and Chairman, Committee on the
Judiciary

Thank you, Chairman Sensenbrenner. I am very pleased to be here at
the second hearing of the Over-Criminalization Task Force, following
its reauthorization earlier this year.
As we all heard last year, the U.S. Code currently contains an
estimated 4,500 federal crimes, and Congress is adding new crimes at a
rapid rate--approximately 500 per decade. The fact that this is only an
estimate means that no one knows exactly how many provisions in the
federal Code subject American citizens to criminal sanctions.
This is due in large part to what many have termed ``legislation by
accumulation,'' which means that Congress has simply accumulated new
offenses for more than 200 years by creating new federal laws--often,
in response to a national crisis--or expanding existing laws. It has
done this with little consideration given to whether the conduct in
question should be criminalized at the federal level, or is better left
to the states.
This accumulation of offenses has resulted in the ``over-
federalization'' issue this Task Force confronts today. As Chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, the over-federalization of the criminal
law is of particular concern to me. It is clear that no one benefits
when the federal government indiscriminately criminalizes conduct
without regard to prudential and constitutional limitations.
Over-federalization has seeped into every facet of the criminal
law--from traditionally ``street-level'' crime like kidnapping to white
collar fraud cases. For example, many scholars in this area have noted
that the Department of Justice has employed novel legal theories in
prosecuting traditional mail and wire fraud cases, in order to force
defendants to settle. Earlier this year, I sent a letter to the
Department seeking information on the $8.1 billion--that's billion with
a ``B''--in civil and criminal fines that they claimed to have
recovered in fiscal year 2013. Constantly seeking a ``record penalty,''
which has been the M.O. of this Justice Department, strikes me as a
potentially political objective. However, political motivations should
not drive settlements in criminal cases.
Additionally, I am cognizant of the issues raised by many regarding
the concurrent jurisdiction exercised by federal and state law
enforcement in many areas, particularly with regard to violent crime.
Under my leadership, this Committee is dedicated to ensuring that the
legislation we produce addresses conduct that is appropriately handled
by federal law enforcement, so the resources of federal courts and
agencies can be directed most effectively. The American people deserve
no less.
I thank our distinguished panel of witnesses, and look forward to
their testimony.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Conyers follows:]

Prepared Statement of the Honorable John Conyers, Jr., a Representative
in Congress from the State of Michigan, and Ranking Member, Committee
on the Judiciary

Today's hearing focuses on the serious problem of over-
federalization of crime.
The broad scope of this problem is evidenced by the fact that there
are approximately 4,500 federal crimes--many of which overlap with
state law--that are codified in various titles of the United States
Code.
Our analysis of this problem should begin where there is the
greatest extent of overlap, namely, federal and state drug laws.
Even though the federal government traditionally relies on state
and local law enforcement agencies to address illegal drug use under
nonfederal law, more than 100,000 individuals are currently
incarcerated in federal prisons for violating federal drug laws.
This is the result of our Nation's long-term, though largely
ineffectual ``War on Drugs,'' which annually costs American taxpayers
$51 billion.
It is also important to keep in mind that the vast majority of
these individuals have been convicted of low level, non-violent federal
drug crimes that are nevertheless subject to mandatory minimum
sentences that restrict judicial discretion.
And, these sentences are generally far more severe than anything
than would be handed down in a state court.
Additionally, state and federal drug laws are sometimes in
conflict. For example, 20 states have legalized the use of marijuana
for medical use while Colorado and Washington have now legalized its
recreational use. This has caused varying levels of conflict between
federal and state enforcement priorities.
Rather than pursue mere possession charges, federal, state, and
local law enforcement should better coordinate their efforts to target
the high-level distribution of illegal drugs and to ensure that
criminal enterprises and cartels do not infiltrate the realm of
legalized marijuana use.
In addition, we should consider how federal law enforcement can--
overall--work with their state and local counterparts to maximize
efficiencies in fighting crime.
In the wake of the Great Recession, many state, county, and
municipal police forces continue to struggle with tight budgets and
reduced resources to combat crime in their communities.
To address that critical need, federal officers should be utilized
to support state and local law enforcement agencies.
For example, the FBI could provide its expertise for investigating
multi-state crime rings, as discussed at the hearing on human
trafficking held earlier this week.
The Fish and Wildlife Service could lend its proficiency in
stopping poaching on state and federal land.
And, the EPA could assist in criminal investigations of criminal
polluters, such as the recent case in New York where two companies were
prosecuted for dumping thousands of tons of asbestos debris directly
next to the Mohawk River.
Federal and state law enforcement collaboration would advance
common goals of fighting crimes and reducing wasteful duplication of
effort.
Finally, we should consider the role Congress itself has played
regarding the problem of over-federalization of crimes.
On average, Congress establishes 50 new federal crimes per year.
Unfortunately, these new laws are often considered in a reactionary
rather than deliberative milieu.
Thus, before establishing any new federal crime, we should first
ask:

is there a strong national interest warranting action,

are the states in a better position than the federal
government to address the problem; and

is a new law really needed when the issue may simply
involve a matter of better enforcement.
Just yesterday, the Crime Subcommittee held a hearing on the dire
problem of domestic minor sex trafficking.
At that hearing, it became very clear that the best way to provide
immediate relief would be to enforce existing local, state, and federal
laws that are already on the books.
Accordingly, I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on these
issues.
I also hope we will incorporate what we learn today about over-
federalization into the Task Force's upcoming hearings on criminal
penalties and the collateral consequences of federal convictions.

TESTIMONY OF JAMES A. STRAZZELLA, PROFESSOR OF LAW/JAMES G.
SCHMIDT CHAIR IN LAW, TEMPLE UNIVERSITY BEASLEY SCHOOL OF LAW

Mr. Strazzella. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have met red
lights before.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. Could you please activate your mike? The
green light means it is on.
Mr. Strazzella. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is it working?
Mr. Sensenbrenner. No.
Mr. Strazzella. Mr. Chairman, is it working now?
Mr. Sensenbrenner. No. We have a technical glitch.
Mr. Cassilly, let's try your mike.
Mr. Strazzella. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. Gotcha.
Mr. Strazzella. As always, I am pleased to respond to the
Committee's invitation to testify. The dramatic increase in the
amount of Federal criminal statutes raises an issue of
fundamental and pervasive importance to the Nation and to the
American criminal justice system.
I am not representing any group in testifying today, but
unsurprisingly, I do draw upon the American Bar Association's
Bipartisan Task Force on Federalization of Criminal Law, for
which I served as reporter.
My remarks here will be brief. They are confined to one
aspect of the issue, and that is the mounting and duplicating
patchwork of Federal and State crimes that has grown up with
startling speed in the last few decades.
In this area of federalization, the core conduct is often
essentially local in nature. And moreover, the conduct usually
does not lack for zealous prosecution in State agencies.
Criminal law, Federal criminal law included, has important
roles to play in our society, I am sure we all agree. It seeks
to protect our people, but it also brings to bear great
societal power upon members of our society.
The law's awesome power and protection needs to be as
principled, responsible, and as just as it can be.
Today, there is a continuing crisis in the overlap of
Federal and State law, particularly in the areas previously
covered only by State law. Much is at stake in this.
It is a mistake to think that criminalization is cost-free.
There are significant costs associated with the use of Federal
criminal law, costs to our society and governmental structures
in general, and to governmental entities involved in the
devising, enforcing, and adjudicating these, as well as to
individuals who are investigated and charged.
Federal criminal law can best be focused on issues of truly
national or international Federal interests, not on areas that
appropriately belong with the State offense systems.
Indeed, especially in this era of limited resources, as
well as expanding national and international concerns, the
resources of Federal criminal law--that is, Federal
investigative agencies, Federal courts, Federal prosecutors,
and other Federal agencies, including, of course, the critical
attention of important Committee such as this--can best be
focused on crime that involves a truly Federal interest.
I would like to briefly underscore some of the costs of
over-federalization.
Arising from the accumulating patchwork of overlapping
Federal and State law about similar local conduct, it is easy
to overlook these serious systematic and practical costs
involved in the troubling federalization of conduct, formerly
left entirely to the States.
To give a short list, one can borrow from the ABA's report
and its crystallizing list of these costs. They underscore the
fundamental detrimental long-term effects of federalization,
where there is no important Federal interest, only a view that
the conduct is wrong and should be prosecuted by somebody.
Overall, inappropriate federalization constitutes an unwise
allocation of scarce resources, resources that are needed to
meet the genuine issues of crime. Some of the particular costs
of unwarranted federalization are important systematic effects.
It can undermine the delicate balance of Federal and State
systems and have a detrimental effect on State judicial,
prosecutorial, and investigative personnel, who bear the major
responsibility for the enforcement of criminal law.
We all know, I think, that 95-percent-plus of the serious
crimes in this country are prosecuted in the State courts and
will remain so.
It can dissipate State citizen power and move more
decision-making to the Federal level. Other important costs are
placed upon Federal judicial and law enforcement institutions.
It throws more locally oriented cases into the Federal trial
and appellate court system--we know the budget problems the
Federal courts are having--jostling for Federal court resources
and potentially delaying other cases of a true Federal
interest, criminal or noncriminal, to some extent. And to some
extent, it adds these cases to the already expensive Federal
prison system.
Since criminalizing conduct empowers agencies to
investigate the condemned conduct, the more Federal criminal
offenses there are both empower Federal investigating agencies
and can divert their attention from working on more truly
Federal interest crimes.
Some of these costs are also real in terms of accused
persons--this is an inequality problem, I believe--whose fate
and potential sentence, always more severe in the Federal
system, will often unequally rest upon a prosecutorial decision
to select the same essential conduct for prosecution in either
Federal or State court, or, as we know, in both courts.
Of course, there is also an effect on the legislative
branch with the accumulation of a larger and larger body of law
that requires more and more congressional attention to
monitoring agencies.
I can sum up. I have stated these as well in the statement.
I can sum up with the time evaporating, by saying that our
criminal complex system is valuable and worth constant
improvement. It is well-worth remembering that in the important
debate about how to curb crime, it is crucial that the American
justice system not be harmed in the process. There is a long
list of disparities stated in my written statement that tries
to itemize what these disparities are.
The Nation has long justifiably relied on a careful
distribution of power to the national----
Mr. Sensenbrenner. The gentleman's time has expired.
Mr. Strazzella. Thank you.

TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH I. CASSILLY, STATE'S ATTORNEY FOR HARFORD
COUNTY, MARYLAND, AND PAST PRESIDENT, NATIONAL DISTRICT
ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION

Mr. Cassilly. Thank you, Chairman Sensenbrenner, Ranking
Member Scott, Members of the Subcommittee. I am testifying
today on behalf of the National District Attorneys Association,
the oldest and largest organization, representing over 39,000
State and local prosecutors who prosecute 95 percent of
criminal cases in the United States.
I have been a prosecutor in Maryland for 37 years. And as a
prosecutor, my experience with Federal agencies has been
largely one of cooperation. But the following is an example of
how over-federalization can be more than just too many laws on
the books.
On December 3, 2002, an 8-year-old little girl did not
return home from school in Baltimore. City police gathered
evidence that pointed to the mother's boyfriend, Abeokuto, as a
suspect. The following day, in an effort to divert suspicion
from him, Abeokuto mailed an anonymous ransom demand to the
mother. A laboratory examination of that letter found the
suspect's fingerprints and DNA.
The U.S. attorney for Maryland obtained a warrant for
sending a threat through the U.S. mail, a 10-year felony.
The suspect fled from Maryland. On 12 December, the little
girl's body was found in a remote wooded area in Hartford
County, in my jurisdiction. Her throat had been cut several
times, and she had been struck in the head.
Because of the short winter's day, the crime scene was to
be secured overnight and processed in the daylight to avoid
destroying or overlooking evidence. A State warrant charging
the suspect with capital murder, kidnapping, and extortion was
issued.
That evening, I received a phone call from the officers
guarding the crime scenes. An assistant United States attorney
and a team from the FBI had shown up and ordered the State
police to turn over the crime scene. I told them the evidence
that could be found around the girl's body added nothing to the
Federal case, but we would share what we found with the feds.
That didn't dissuade them from wanting to stomp all over my
crime scene. I said I would have anyone who crossed the crime
scene tape arrested. The feds left.
A week later, the suspect was arrested in Birmingham,
Alabama, by the FBI and was returned to Maryland, but the U.S.
attorney refused to allow the State to have access to the
defendant to pursue our prosecution, and placed the defendant
in a holding facility in Maryland as far from my county as
possible.
The U.S. attorney never spoke to the victim's family, nor
would the U.S. attorney speak with me to explain why it was
more important to pursue a 10-year Federal crime than a death
sentence for murder. I even wrote to the Attorney General of
the United States to intervene.
After 6 months of frustration, I held a press conference in
front of the Federal courthouse. I accused the U.S. attorney of
publicity-seeking and subverting real justice in the case of
this child and her grieving family.
Two weeks later, the U.S. attorney for Maryland stepped
down and custody of the defendant was surrendered to the State.
My written testimony contains a similar, more recent
example from New York.
Erasing unused laws from Federal books makes a strong
statement of Federal priorities. The FBI investigated a $70,000
theft that occurred on the Aberdeen Proving Ground, a Federal
installation beside my county. But because the law did not meet
the U.S. attorney's prosecution threshold, the FBI asked me to
prosecute.
I have seen cases where criminals drive onto Federal
property from a State jurisdiction to deal drugs, because if
they were caught, they would not meet Federal prosecution
thresholds.
The Attorney General directed U.S. attorneys not to
prosecute low-level drug offenses, despite the fact that U.S.
attorneys had not prosecuted low-level drug offenses for
decades. The Department of Justice has targeted the largest or
most publicity-worthy drug offenses, and has left the rest for
State and local prosecutors to handle.
When DOJ chooses not to enforce certain Federal laws in
States which have legalized marijuana, in some cases not
prosecuting dealers who are selling hundreds of pounds a week,
but prosecutes those same cases in other States, it sends the
message to Americans it is acceptable to break Federal law
because the Federal Government inequitably applies the law.
These examples illustrate that if the U.S. attorneys cannot
protect Federal interests, it is unlikely that they will act to
prosecute most of the laws which cover State interests and
concerns.
In reviewing existing or future Federal legislation, the
issue of who has the resources to investigate and prosecute a
crime should be considered, and whether utilization of those
resources will result in neglecting other areas which should be
a Federal priority.
Chairman Sensenbrenner, Ranking Member Scott, Members of
the Committee, thank you for this opportunity, and I will be
glad to answer any questions.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Cassilly follows:]

__________
Mr. Sensenbrenner. Thank you very much, Mr. Cassilly. I
think you have hit the nail on the head, on what this problem
is.
I yield myself 5 minutes. I am not going to use the entire
5 minutes, because, for Members who were not here when the
hearing began, I would like to get this done before we have to
go to vote, so that the witnesses do not have to sit here for
an hour and then most of us won't come back.
That being said, I got into a problem with a well-funded
lobby group over the federalization of dogfights. And I ended
up losing that battle and we passed a Federal law, criminal
law, that makes it a Federal crime to put together a dogfight.
Now, dogfighting is disgusting and a nefarious behavior,
but it seemed to me, but not to this group, that the State and
local authorities could very easily handle dogfights or other
animal fights. And again, we now have a Federal statute on it.
Now this is an example where people think that Congress is
not concerned about an issue unless we pass a Federal crime and
allow the feds to prosecute obviously nefarious behavior.
Where do we draw the line on that? And I would like to ask
for a brief answer from each of you, and then I will go to Mr.
Scott.
Mr. Strazzella. It is a hard question, and the hard job
falls to Congress, of course, often to say no. It is clear, I
think to everybody, that the drive for much of the Federal law
is interest groups and the popularity of making a Statement
about crime.
I think there are two quick answers. One is, it is useful
to insist on an identification of a Federal interest as
compared to a State interest and to ask if there is some reason
the State is not already prosecuting it, which is seldom the
case in many of these instances.
And the second is to think of what systematic ways
Congress, much more expert than I am, certainly, can set up to
screen these kind of requests and buffer the Members from the
political pressure to just enact it.
Sunset laws may do that. Some reports from some
administrative agencies that help Congress identify what the
costs of this statute would be, what it would divert, what it
would really accomplish. As you know, many of these cases are
never prosecuted by the feds, or terribly selectively
prosecuted, so having some buffer that gives you the
information to be able to say to people, ``I am against this
activity, but I don't think it needs to be a Federal crime,'' I
think is a systematic advantage.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. Mr. Cassilly?
Mr. Cassilly. I agree with that, and I think the point
really is that there should be a screening requirement, that to
even request a Federal law be introduced that there must be a
showing that the States are either unable or unwilling to enact
laws to deal with the problem. But moreover than that, that
there must be some sort of compelling Federal interest in
either an interstate crime, which crosses borders and makes
State enforcement difficult, or a crime that goes
internationally through the Internet or wires or banking
systems or some other international chain of commerce that
would make State enforcement difficult.
The burden should be, it seems to me, on the people
requesting the law. The burden should be on them to have them
come in and make that case to Congress before the law can even
be introduced.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. Thank you very much.
I yield back the balance of my time.
The gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Scott?
Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
One of the things we have talked about is carjacking, which
is obviously a State crime. States already have laws against
robbery. But it is a crime of the day, and we have to have a
political response. Obviously, that is one that we have
identified that should be left to the States.
How would you analyze things like consumer ID theft that by
its nature crosses state lines, although the crime is committed
locally? Child trafficking and routine drug cases, in terms of
whether they should be federalized or local? ID theft, child
trafficking, and routine drug cases?
Mr. Cassilly. Well, the ID theft tends to be multistate. I
mean, once you have somebody's ID, you can order things on the
Internet, have them shipped in from everywhere. You can perform
financial transactions. So I think that there is a sharing
there. There needs to be some cooperation between the State and
the Federal authorities.
If there isn't a Federal law, we are not going to get
cooperation from the Federal authorities to work some of those
cases. So I believe that we do still need that.
We are dealing with interstate commerce. We are dealing
with banks, federally regulated banks, when we are dealing with
some of that sort of stuff. And you get into the issue of
subpoenaing evidence, and acquiring records and transactions.
With respect to the drug issues, again, I think, as my
testimony referenced, the feds haven't prosecuted low-level
drug offenses, and I have been doing this for 37 years, in my
memory.
On the other hand, the last five wires that my local county
task force has run, the last fire five wiretaps on drug cases,
have led us to suppliers in New York, New Jersey, Atlanta,
Georgia, Florida, Arizona. So there is an area where, at some
level, there continues to be the need for Federal drug
legislation to assist the States. And I think that that should
be the emphasis, as where do we need to assist the States
without intruding on areas that the States can already cover.
And I am sorry I forgot your last one?
Mr. Scott. Child trafficking.
Mr. Cassilly. I think that there you run into, in some
instances, immigration issues, so again, I think that there is
a role there for the Federal agencies to play, because when you
have children, it is often difficult to identify them or trace
back where they are coming from. I mean, we are talking
sometimes 13- and 14-year-olds.
Mr. Scott. In terms of some of the cases in which you were
involved, could the Federal Government be more helpful, not
with the criminal law prosecution itself, but with coordination
and things like use of laboratories and other expertise?
Mr. Cassilly. Certainly, with identity theft. It would be
very helpful with identity theft, if there were certain
repositories where we can go to, to find out who else is having
the problem, where is our victim's identity being used, shut
down the use of certain Social Security numbers. So we can get
some help that way, where we know somebody's Social Security
number has been stolen and has been replicated. It is often
very difficult to get cooperation from the Social Security
folks and other folks to kind of shut that down, to stop the
additional commission of crimes.
So yes, I agree.
Mr. Scott. Mr. Strazzella, can you talk about the double
jeopardy implications of having dual prosecutions?
Mr. Strazzella. I can, briefly, not necessarily wholly
accurately.
As we know, the Supreme Court has insisted that because
there are different sovereigns involved--the United States, on
one hand, and an individual State--that the Double Jeopardy
Clause provision that you can't be put twice in jeopardy for
``the same offense'' does not cover that.
And so bank robbery, for example, which was made a crime in
a period of new bank robbery activity, is basically a Federal
crime, as I understand it, because the bank is federally
insured. That is what makes it a Federal crime. It is also
local crime. It is like any other robbery at a grocery store,
in that sense.
As I recall the case, the Supreme Court has said they are
two separate sovereigns, two separate crimes. They can both be
prosecuted. You can be convicted of both, acquitted of one and
then convicted.
There are, to the credit I think of both some State
statutes and the Department of Justice, there are some internal
administrative regulations, I believe, in the United States
attorney manual about when it would be appropriate to prosecute
a crime after any crime has been prosecuted in the State court,
whether the feds would pick it up, or vice versa.
So there is some protection of that. But it is not
constitutional protection.
It is a serious matter, I think. And I think one of the
concerns in the background of my mind is the inequality of the
feds picking up these cases. Carjacking is a perfect example.
The ones they pick up are not because the car was taken in D.C.
and found in Michigan, traveled over state lines. The statute
is premised on any part of the car having moved in interstate
commerce, which is the jurisdictional hook.
And what happens is the cars are made in Baltimore and
shipped to D.C. They may be here 20 years before they are
hijacked. And that gives them a jurisdictional hook. But it may
be robbed at one corner and found three corners away.
My concern is that that inequality, which the courts have
basically said is a matter for prosecutorial discretion, and
the double jeopardy law, both may get expanded as Federal
jurisdiction becomes more and more wide, so that we have a
patchwork that is almost one on top of the other.
It would make no sense to have----
Mr. Sensenbrenner. The gentleman's time has expired.
The gentleman from Idaho, Mr. Labrador?
Mr. Labrador. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to follow up on your comments, Mr. Strazzella and
Mr. Cassilly. I like where he was going.
The text of the Tenth Amendment says, ``The powers not
delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States
respectively, or to the people.''
Do you believe that one of the major contributing factors
to over-federalization of criminal law is a long-standing and
bipartisan marginalization of the Tenth Amendment?
Or in other words, it seems like we, as Members of Congress
from both parties, have forgotten what the Tenth Amendment is
about, which is about letting the locals decide the local
issues.
Mr. Cassilly, and then Mr. Strazzella.
Mr. Cassilly. I think basically the problem with over-
federalization is largely due to reacting to the crime of the
month, so that Mr. Scott's example of carjacking, when
carjacking was sort of the crime of the month, or certain other
crimes that become--Michael Vick goes and gets involved with
dogfighting, becomes the crime du jour, and everybody runs out
to pass those sort of things.
So I really think that this is a political issue. There is
pressure on Members of Congress to respond to this, to say this
is bad, this is wrong. They don't want to say this isn't bad.
They don't want to be perceived as saying, ``We don't care
about this,'' so a law gets passed.
Mr. Labrador. But if we understood, as Members of Congress,
that yes, it is bad, but the local jurisdiction can handle bad
things, that we are not the only ones who can handle bad
things, do you think, Mr. Strazzella, that maybe we need to
spend more time talking about that?
Mr. Strazzella. The answer is yes. I don't want to pretend
any expertise on the amendment that you mentioned, but I do
think, in line with what we both said earlier, that some
presentation to Congress about whether this is being handled at
the State level, in any particular State where comes up, the
carjacking cases were terrific pieces in the paper of people
being dragged down the street, if those presentations were made
and the case was made the State is already handling this well,
it would give Members of Congress, I think, a buffer to say
there is no reason for us to get into this.
If I can just add to the question that was asked, as well,
I think one of the driving forces is the country is incredibly
mobile.
I see this with my students. They all think it is one big
country. If you tell them there is Maryland and Pennsylvania,
they hardly remember. And the Internet has pushed that forward.
The mobility going over state lines is such, the international
feel of things, the email, has minimized, to some degree, their
view, the young people's view, I think, and many people's view,
of the fact that these States have different independent,
historical significance that is important.
Mr. Labrador. Thank you.
Mr. Strazzella. And I think that really plays into it more
than a lot of legality.
Mr. Labrador. Mr. Cassilly, as a prosecutor, what are your
thoughts about mandatory minimums?
Mr. Cassilly. I think in some instances, especially with
repeat offenders where we know that these particular people are
responsible for a high percentage of crimes, and getting them
off the street prevents future crime, yes, I would agree with
mandatory minimums.
But I think often judges should have the discretion,
because you do treat the facts of each case. And the facts
surrounding the background of the defendant are all different.
And a judge should have a certain amount of discretion to take
that into account and respond to that.
On the other hand, if the defendant has proven himself from
previous conduct not to be a good risk to be on the street,
then, I would say, that mandatory minimums are appropriate.
Mr. Labrador. Do you think mandatory minimums should be
used to force low-level defendants to give up the people up the
chain, for example, in drug convictions?
Mr. Cassilly. I don't have a problem with that, as a
prosecutor.
Mr. Labrador. All right, thank you. I have no further
questions.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. The gentleman's time has expired.
The gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Conyers?
Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I applaud this Task Force for examining over-
criminalization and particularly over-federalizing so many
crimes.
I want to emphasize the problem with drugs and the criminal
law. And before I do that, I wanted to remind the Committee
that there are 4,500, approximately, Federal crimes, many
overlapping State law, and that we hand down from Congress, we
ourselves are responsible for establishing about 50 new Federal
crimes every year.
So we are in a tough situation. And when you talk about
drug laws, we have an extremely difficult situation in which
the so-called war on drugs, although largely ineffectual, costs
$51 billion every year. And many of them are low-level,
nonviolent Federal drug crimes, unfortunately, and they are
subject, of course, to the mandatory minimum sentencing
strategy, which I vigorously resist and think is
counterproductive.
And so what I wanted to do is go over with you exactly what
the Federal criminal code ought to contain, or how do we divide
the Federal and State crime situation?
And I just had delivered this morning a letter from the
Judicial Conference of the United States, which I received a
copy from the secretary of that conference on the stationery of
the Chief Justice of the United States.
The conference specifically identified five types of
criminal offenses deemed appropriate for Federal jurisdiction:
offenses against the Federal Government, or its inherent
interests; criminal activity with substantial multistate or
international aspects; criminal activity involving complex
commercial or institutional enterprises most effectively
prosecuted using Federal resources or expertise; serious high-
level or widespread State or local government corruption; and
fifth, criminal cases raising highly sensitive local issues.
Now, I assume this is accurate, and if you do, too, I would
like you to comment on that.
This makes our task that we are examining here this morning
extremely difficult, because there are so many levels of
activity that are interchangeable.
And so it may be that the most important thing that comes
out of this hearing is the fact that there are a growing number
of Members of Congress who realize that over-criminalization is
partly our responsibility because we are adding to the pile
every year.
Do you agree with me that this is an extremely complex and
challenging problem?
Mr. Sensenbrenner. The gentleman's time has expired.
Can the witnesses answer the question briefly, because we
are running up against the bell ringing, and others wish to ask
questions?
Mr. Cassilly. I mean, I think that has been the nature of
our testimony up until now, that we do believe it is a problem.
I agree, Mr. Conyers, what the issue is is where does the
State's ability to handle some of these problems start and end,
and where can the Federal Government assist the States by
moving into the areas that you have just spoken about.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr.
Holding?
Mr. Holding. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Cassilly, I recall the incident that you spoke about,
regarding one of the former U.S. attorneys in Maryland. I would
point out that it was that incident, and a few other things,
that precipitated his resignation prior to the end of his term.
Of course, I would also say that the benefit of that is the
next U.S. attorney that you got in Maryland is probably one of
the more competent and professional U.S. attorneys in the
country that we have had in some time.
Mr. Cassilly. Rod Rosenstein and I get along very well. He
goes out of his way to reach out to the States to work with us.
Mr. Holding. Right. So competent that your senators in
Maryland kept over from the prior Administration, thinking that
they couldn't do any better than him as their U.S. attorney.
I want to explore two different things. One is, in your
work prosecuting State crimes, do you ever find it beneficial
for the potentiality of a Federal prosecution to be up there?
So you have a defendant before you, and the fear out there that
he could be prosecuted federally leads him to swiftly plead to
your charges and help clear out your docket a little bit faster
than otherwise?
Mr. Cassilly. That does happen, especially in areas of
child pornography in Maryland, often the fear of Federal
prosecution for child pornography, some drug offenses.
And it was mentioned in terms of robberies or bank
robberies, sometimes that happens, although I have to say that
often with some violent crimes, especially in the East Coast
where States are so close, we often find some people who are
doing a pattern of robberies go from Virginia to D.C. to
Maryland, that is helpful to have Federal jurisdiction to deal
with that, because not only can they bring all that evidence
together, but they can present all the evidence to the
sentencing judge for a stricter Federal sentence than we might
present to a State judge.
Mr. Holding. Secondly, are there any areas of Federal law
where you have evidence of a crime and you know that the U.S.
attorney would be better able to obtain a much longer sentence?
You actually reach out to the U.S. attorney and say, ``Would
you please prosecute this case? I know you can get a higher
sentence.'' You mentioned child pornography.
Mr. Cassilly. We do that with our drug cases often, too.
Not only do they get, in some instances, better sentences, but
by putting the defendant in a Federal institution, away from
the State of Maryland, they prevent the defendant from
continuing to run his criminal enterprise from a State
institution by getting him out of the way. So there is an
advantage to that.
Mr. Holding. That is interesting.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. Thank you.
The gentleman from New York, Mr. Jeffries?
Mr. Jeffries. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank the
witnesses for their presence here today.
Mr. Cassilly, I believe you made reference in your
testimony, and also in the written submission, that there were
some instances where the Federal Government was not prosecuting
drug crimes at a low level. Is that correct?
Mr. Cassilly. Yes.
Mr. Jeffries. Not for purposes of clarity, is it that you
were referring to instances where Federal prosecutors were
declining to pursue marijuana prosecution?
Mr. Cassilly. No, generally, other types of drugs as well.
For example, the complex wiretaps that my county officers
conduct, generally, we turn over the top of those
organizations, which are often multistate--getting their
supplies from out-of-state or supplying out-of-state--we turn
those folks over to Federal prosecutors.
And we work very well with the Federal prosecutors. I mean,
we sit down, look through the cases with them, discuss which
ones they are going to work better on and which ones we will
work better on. But generally, we take all of the lower level
pretty much in-state defendants and take care of them. They
take the upper-level folks.
So it is not just marijuana. It is everything across the
board.
Mr. Jeffries. Okay, right now the Federal system, 8 percent
of the individuals in the Federal system have been convicted of
a violent crime, but about 50 percent of the individuals are
actual nonviolent, low-level drug dealers. So that is why am
curious as to your observation, because what the numbers
suggest is that, for decades, a disproportionate number of the
individuals who are actually being prosecuted, convicted,
sentenced, and put behind bars in the Federal penitentiary are
actually low-level drug offenders.
Mr. Cassilly. That doesn't go along with my experience. I
mean, I would have to ask what is the definition of a low-level
drug dealer, for one thing. I mean, we may have a definitional
issue.
The other problem, too, that comes up with some of these is
that there is an offer to plea down. So you may have a drug
dealer who is actually liable for a more serious crime, who
works out a plea to a lesser crime. It benefits the drug
dealer, but it also moves the case through the system.
Perhaps if you are dealing with uncooperative witnesses or
other issues, evidentiary issues, the prosecutor deals the
crime down from a more serious level to a less serious level,
but the crime was the same in terms of the nature of the crime,
but it is reflected as a lower seriousness crime.
Mr. Jeffries. Thank you. I appreciate the explanation
there.
Professor Strazzella, you reference the general notion that
there is an increasing overlap between Federal crimes and State
crimes, consistent with what has been mentioned by my
colleagues here. I think that is, certainly, troubling for me,
for a wide variety of reasons.
In your experience, the wire fraud statute that currently
exists in law and is often robustly used by Federal prosecutors
to prosecute what otherwise may be a State offense but where,
for instance, a fax machine may have been used consistent with
a fraudulent representation, even if the fax is transmitted
from one locality to the next not crossing state lines, then
invokes Federal jurisdiction. Do you think the wire fraud
statute is an area we might be able to look at in terms of
whether it is being abused?
Mr. Strazzella. I thank you for the question. I think the
question goes along with some of the early ones in some ways.
I keep trying to sort in my mind what is valid Federal
jurisdiction, and, certainly, interstate commerce is the basis
for a lot of it. It was the basis I mentioned for the
carjacking statute. The wire fraud statutes were that. They
were originally telephone wires, and built on the mail that
went across the lines. And the mail was actually premised that
it was a government function.
And the trouble I am having, as I think about what you
said, is there are cases of wire fraud that are clearly
interstate. And has he said, you really need the resources of
the feds across state lines to deal with those. There other
ones that are just from one local bank to two guys two blocks
away, and it will still fall under it. And that is a
prosecutorial decision.
I wouldn't preclude those kind of wire fraud statutes,
certainly. But I think the discretion for the D.A. and the U.S.
attorney to say this is really a local matter is probably where
the rubber hits the road in that kind of situation.
Mr. Jeffries. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. The gentleman's time has expired.
The gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Bachus?
Mr. Bachus. Mr. Cassilly, your story about the little girl,
many times as Members of Congress, we have seen instances where
there would be an interstate crime ring, or even an
international crime ring, headquartered in a different State.
And the FBI is approached by local businesses that are victims,
and they are told they don't have the resources.
And then we pick up the paper and see where they are
involved in a case of bullying in a high school. It was high
visibility, a lot of publicity.
Is there some way, I mean, one way may be to allow the
State or local authorities to opt to prosecute or decline to
prosecute. And at that time, the U.S. attorney would take a
role. Or where the State or local law enforcement agencies go
to the Federal agencies and say we lack the resources.
Mr. Cassilly. We do do that now. As Mr. Holding pointed
out, we have a very good U.S. attorney in Maryland right now,
Rod Rosenstein. If I need something from Rod, I have his direct
dial phone number. I can pick that up and call him and say, ``I
need some help here. Can you assign some people? Can we have a
meeting? Can we talk about some cooperation?''
Sometimes they don't have the resources. I mean, the answer
for me sometimes is, we just don't have anybody to work on
that, or that is not going to pass our threshold.
But sometimes the feds are coming to me and asking us to do
things. I mean, we do a lot of prosecutions for Federal
agencies, FBI, ATF, because U.S. Attorney's Office, even though
they have worked on the case and done the investigation, the
U.S. Attorney's Office won't prosecute, and so the State
prosecutor ends up taking the investigation from the Federal
investigators and pursuing it in State courts.
Mr. Bachus. I would say, 90 percent of the U.S. attorneys
are doing exactly that. I mean, they have a great relationship
with the local. And I think, presently, that is the case in the
area I represent.
Are there any guidelines that would, say, prevent that U.S.
attorney from coming in and taking that murder case over?
Mr. Cassilly. Well, I, certainly, didn't get any help when
I wanted to get them to back off of their mail threat case and
turn the defendant over to us quickly. I mean, it eventually
happened, but we wasted a lot of time at the State court level.
I had State court deadlines running where we were supposed to
have done arraignments and those types of things, and those
didn't happen. I had to go to the State judges and request
extensions of time for different things to happen.
Mr. Bachus. I wonder if the National D.A. Association or
someone could suggest to us some language to help, maybe
guidance.
Mr. Cassilly. We would be happy to work on that.
Mr. Bachus. I noticed the Judicial Conference, the letter
has been referred to, actually among the cases that they say
are Federal Government were criminal cases raising highly
sensitive local issues. That, to me, kind of expands it maybe
into cases that are just getting a lot of publicity, which I
think is not a reason for Federal involvement. So
I think that one is a pretty big loophole to go through.
But if you could suggest at least some guidelines or
guidance that we can get to prevent the type of thing that
happened to you.
Mr. Cassilly. We will be back with you.
Mr. Bachus. Thank you.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. I don't think the letter that was
referred to by the gentleman from Alabama and earlier, the
gentleman from Michigan, has been inserted into the record. It
should be. So, without objection, the letter will be put in the
record at this point.*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*The material referred to was not available at the time this
hearing record was finalized and submitted for printing on August 14,
2014.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Johnson?
Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This hearing of the Over-Criminalization Task Force is to
discuss the fact that the Federal Government's role in
investigating and prosecuting crime has grown exponentially.
And you gentlemen are here to shed light on this
phenomenon.
And I could not agree with you more, Mr. Cassilly, when in
the last paragraph of your statement, the last sentence, you
say that in reviewing existing or future Federal legislation,
the issue of who has the resources to investigate and prosecute
a crime should be considered and whether utilization of those
resources will result in neglecting other areas, which should
have a higher Federal priority.
I think that is extremely reasonable and a good guideline
for us to take as we think about imposing more Federal criminal
statutes, some of which are passed only to show that we are
being tough on crime.
So I recognize that, and I respect that.
But then with your testimony and your statement, you also
point to some specific incidents that illustrate prosecutorial
overreach, in your opinion. And then you even go so far as to
name, among all of the unnamed U.S. attorneys, you name our
current U.S. Attorney General, you cite him by name for issuing
an edict not to enforce low-level marijuana prosecutions, and
use that as support for your assertion that if they won't
prosecute Federal laws, then we need to get rid of the laws.
But at the same time, you enjoy the fact that the Federal
lever of a harsher sentence, in some cases, helps you to exact
a favorable plea deal on State charges. And also that when a
drug case is prosecuted by the feds, it is advantageous to you
because it can help remove the defendant from your State, so
that they can no longer run their drug operation.
So it just seems to me that your gripe is more about the
interplay between Federal and State prosecutors in the use of
prosecutorial discretion, as opposed to over-criminalization in
general. Is that correct?
Mr. Cassilly. I don't think so. I mean, I would say, for
example, the examples of carjacking, the examples of animal
cruelty laws, and probably a lot of other laws that I can find
that have been passed and I would be amazed if they had ever
been prosecuted, are sort of meaningless, but they raise public
expectation that something is being done or a problem is being
solved at the Federal level, when in fact it isn't and hasn't
been solved, just because the law has been passed.
And the focus needs to be that these people need to work at
the State level to get this issue solved, or those issues
prosecuted.
And yes, I did make reference to the Attorney General's
statement about low-level drug offenses. I don't remember if it
was specifically low-level marijuana offenses, but at the time
that was made, basically, most State and local prosecutors I
know were kind of amazed that any Federal authorities were
prosecuting low-level drug offenses.
Again, that may be a function of how you define low-level
drug prosecutions. But certainly, in the cases that I work with
my U.S. attorney, they take very, very serious cases, kilo
dealers, large-scale interstate dealers. They are not trying to
take the stuff that States are prosecuting.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. The gentleman's time has expired.
The gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Cohen?
Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Conyers mentioned some categories maybe crimes can fit
in, that are of a Federal nature. And while he did, in a fifth
category, it mentioned crimes that are of a particular local--
not a local nature, but have local import. That might cover it,
but I was concerned about civil rights crimes and crimes that
sometimes may not be prosecuted in parts of the country,
because the local prosecutors aren't as responsive or concerned
or sensitive to certain offenses.
Do you not think that there is a special niche for there to
be Federal jurisdiction and Federal crimes that cover what
would otherwise be State crimes where there would be a civil
rights involvement or nexus?
Both of you, but Mr. Strazzella, I guess, first.
Mr. Strazzella. The last category, which you mentioned, I
was intrigued by. I read it actually differently than the
sensational murder kind of case.
The category of Federal crimes that I think is the most
problematic in terms of constitutional basis, but I think
everybody ends up agreeing should be on the Federal list, are
political corruption crimes. That kind of political
sensitivity, where there is an inherent conflict often in the
local authorities in terms of prosecuting local officials.
And I was intrigued that is on there. The ABA report
actually has something about that as well.
In terms of civil rights, I think it would fall under that
category. In my list, it is often one of the things not
prosecuted by the local people. And, therefore, you have a
statute that gives you a clear basis, and there are a lot of
reasons to step in and those kinds of instances.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you Professor Strazzella.
Mr. Cassilly. I think the question should be what are we
defining as a civil right. Is it a voting right? Is it some
other right with a Federal nexus? Are we simply talking about
defining a special protection, or a protection for an ethnic or
otherwise defined group of people on a crime that already
exists.
And I use, for an example, in Maryland, we have passed
special laws based on if there was an assault committed on
someone because of a specific motivation because of their
gender or----
Mr. Cohen. A hate crime.
Mr. Cassilly. A hate crime. Those are often difficult to
prove because it is often difficult to prove why someone was
assaulted. Was it just a street robbery? Was it just a bar
fight? Was there something else going on? And often, there are
already existing laws and crimes that cover the behavior, not
necessarily the motivation.
So those are issues, but I guess when you are asking me
about a violation of a civil right, is it a Federal civil right
or is it a State right that would be better covered in State
court?
Mr. Cohen. Who was the Justice that said he didn't
necessarily know how to define pornography, but he knew it when
he saw it?
Mr. Strazzella. Justice Stewart.
Mr. Cohen. Well, I think Justice Stewart would have the
same thing. I am not sure always what a civil right is, but I
know it when I see it, and I think U.S. attorneys can see it
better than district attorneys, in general.
I think in Texas, I am pretty sure that that gay person who
was dragged behind the car, Matthew Shepard----
Mr. Gohmert. It was an African-American, and the two most
responsible got the death penalty.
Mr. Cohen. Federal or State?
Mr. Gohmert. Through the State. The Federal didn't have
death penalty.
Mr. Cohen. Reclaiming my time, I thank you for the help
from Texas.
Tennessee helped Texas a lot, so it is nice of you to
reciprocate.
Are there other Federal crimes that you think are uniquely
of a Federal nature that didn't come within those five
categories, classes? No?
Mr. Strazzella. Not offhand, but I do want to say, as I
heard Representative Conyers read this, what was interesting to
me was what was not on there. A lot of the Federal crimes that
are in the books today are not on that list.
And I think it makes the point that I mentioned. The
Federal courts feel overwhelmed by a lot of these local crimes.
I used to be a Federal prosecutor, and there is often the view
this ought to be somewhere else.
Mr. Cohen. Our time is over, but before I am told my time
is over, it was Matthew Shepard.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. The gentleman's time has expired.
The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Gohmert?
Mr. Gohmert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I heard my friend from Tennessee mention from drug behind a
car, and so that was in Jasper, Texas, and it was an African-
American.
And it actually fits in well with the discussion we are
having, because as Federal legislators, we feel a need when we
hear about something that outrageous, that just shocks the
conscience, I would like to have a law that allows a victim's
family to drag the perpetrators behind their vehicle of choice.
But under Texas law, we had the death penalty. Three
perpetrators in that egregious, horrible crime, and the two
most culpable got the death penalty, and the other got life in
prison.
But we didn't want to stand idly by. So we rush in to
create a Federal crime that doesn't even have the death
penalty, that couldn't be nearly as severe as the State itself
had. And yet we want to federalize that offense as well.
And I believe in the Matthew Shepard case, a horrible
incident, but I believe there may have been two life sentences
under State law. So again, the Federal law really wouldn't have
made any difference. But once again, we rush in to try to say
we have a bigger, better idea since we are the Federal
legislators, and we will get the Federal officials involved.
We have seen times when civil rights were violated and
people did not receive--may have been acquitted of a State
crime--but a civil rights violation was an appropriate charge,
and people were held to account in that manner.
My problem is when we actually legislate and say what
really amounts to a police power prosecution is now going to be
a Federal prosecution. And it does overwhelm our Federal
courts.
I have seen that personally, as an attorney. As a State
court judge, I was amazed at how many State actions actually
could have been charged in Federal court and the Federal
prosecutors were saying our plates are filled, we don't know
why Congress keeps trying to usurp State police authority.
But that is how we end up with thousands of Federal crimes
that really do seem like they need to be consolidated into--I
mean we have the 18 U.S. Code where they ought to be
consolidated, and yet they are throughout.
So I applaud the Chair and the Ranking Member and others
that see the need to cut this down so that we, for one thing,
don't allow regulators, unaccountable bureaucrats, to make laws
for which there are criminal penalties.
Do either of you see any time when you think it might be
appropriate for Congress to pass a law saying it will be a
crime to violate this section and any violation of any
regulation set by the bureaucrats is appropriate for a crime?
Or do you, as most of us think, we shouldn't have a crime
unless Congress passes it?
Mr. Cassilly. My comment earlier was that I think that
there should be a showing predicate to the introduction of any
law that, one, the States are either unable or unwilling to act
in a certain instance; and, moreover, that there is a
compelling Federal interest to act in that area, that somehow
there is interstate action or regulation of federally regulated
organizations, such as banks or the Internet or something else
like that. That should be a predicate showing before the law is
even----
Mr. Gohmert. But once, if that predicate is met, do you
think it is appropriate to have Congress just pass a general
criminal statute and the specifics will be filled in by agency
personnel?
Mr. Cassilly. I have always felt that that is sort of
unconstitutional. Our courts have said that criminal statutes
should be narrowly construed. How can you narrowly construe a
statute when it is sort of subject to grow and be modified at
the whim of whoever is out there.
Mr. Gohmert. A great point. Thank you.
Mr. Sensenbrenner. The gentleman's time has expired.
This has been a very interesting and meaningful hearing. I
would like to thank both of the witnesses for giving us a lot
of insight into the problems that we face on the over-
federalization.
I think if we try to cut back on some of the Federal
crimes, people who have persuaded Congress or the bureaucrats
to put something on the statutes are going to be screaming
quite loudly.
But there are some crimes that I think are better
prosecuted at the State level and using State resources, and we
don't need to send the FBI out on everything that really can be
better handled by local police and local prosecutors.
Without objection, all Members will have 5 legislative days
to submit additional written questions for the witnesses or
additional materials for the record.
And without objection, this hearing is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 10:37 a.m., the Task Force was adjourned.]
