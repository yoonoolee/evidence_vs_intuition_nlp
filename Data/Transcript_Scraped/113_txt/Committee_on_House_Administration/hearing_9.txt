WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2013

House of Representatives,
Committee on House Administration,
Washington, D.C.
The committee met, pursuant to call, at 11:34 a.m., in Room

[chairman of the committee] presiding.

The Chairman. I would like to call to order the Committee
on House Administration for today's committee hearing. A quorum
is present so that we can proceed.
The meeting record will remain open for 5 legislative days
so that Members might submit any materials that they wish to be
included in the record.
The Chairman. And today we are just going to consider one
item in the markup before we go into our hearing, a committee
resolution regarding the House Academic Competition.
Now, earlier this year, with the support of House
leadership, we introduced a House resolution, the Academic
Competition Resolution of 2013, to establish a competition that
promotes greater innovation among students across this country
in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and
math, also known as STEM. The resolution, cosponsored by nearly
every member of this committee, passed the House with an
overwhelming 411 votes--a very clear, overdue acknowledgment
that in our Nation we need to increase STEM awareness.
As leaders, educators, and parents, it is our
responsibility to help equip today's youth with the skills that
they need to succeed. STEM research and innovation is the major
skill set driving today's global economy, and, unfortunately,
we are at risk of falling behind other countries and losing
jobs to our overseas competitors. To remain competitive, we
must increase awareness among our students and encourage
greater participation in the STEM fields.
With that goal in mind, in February the House adopted a
resolution creating a competition that will allow each Member,
each Member of Congress, to host an annual competition among
students in his or her congressional district. And today, as
required by that resolution, we are considering for adoption
the regulations that will govern the competition, including
rules pertaining to contestants, judges, and the use of
resources.
Under the proposed regulations, House Administration will
appoint Members to serve as chairs and co-chairs for the
purpose of setting specific rules and criteria for each annual
competition. Those proposed regulations also permit for the
competition's evolution over time so that it continues to
challenge students in the specialized STEM areas relevant to
ever-changing technology demands.
It is our expectation that the House will plan its
inaugural competition to coincide with this school year so that
schools and educators can encourage and assist with their
students' participation.
Again, it is our responsibility to help to make sure that
our students in this country can compete in the STEM fields.
Their future and this Nation's economic success depend on it,
which is why I am very honored to join my colleagues in
advancing this important House initiative.
And I now would like to recognize the ranking member, our
colleague, Mr. Brady from Pennsylvania, for the purpose of his
opening statement.
Mr. Brady. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have no opening
statement, but I do appreciate you having this meeting and
getting this off on the right start. Thank you.
The Chairman. Thank you.
The Chairman. Any other Members have an opening statement
on this particular issue?
The chair recognizes Mr. Gingrey of Georgia.
Mr. Gingrey. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I want to thank you
for calling the markup today on the regulations for the
recently established House STEM competition.
H. Res. 77 passed with overwhelming support in February of
this year, establishing an academic competition in the fields
of science, technology, engineering, and math, STEM, for
students in our congressional districts. And I was proud to
join every member of this committee in supporting the
resolution. I am proud to rejoin them today to adopt the
regulations governing that competition.
In its inaugural year, the competition will allow
participating students to develop an app using a technology
platform of their choice, really--a tablet, computer, mobile
device. This competition creates a valuable chance to engage
these students and educators--I am sure they would have a
mentor at their local school--and highlight the importance once
again that we talk about so much up here, I don't think we can
talk about it too much, of STEM education, by providing an
incentive for students in a fun and innovative way.
After practicing medicine for nearly 30 years, I am fully
aware of just how valuable a strong foundation in math and
science can be for the future engineers, computer scientists,
and doctors of our Nation. As educators and legislators, we
must not neglect our duties to equip these young people, our
children, these students, with the tools and the knowledge to
build a successful career.
All of the time, we are reading articles about people
getting out of great schools with a graduate degree, and there
was somebody on one of the cable news shows the other day
selling donuts on the streets of New York, saying, ``Hire me.
I've got''--maybe some of you all saw that clip. But, you know,
it is really important that our students know that the job
market of the future, and I think for a long time, is in the
science, space, and technology and engineering and developing
apps and software.
So I see this competition as a valuable opportunity to get
involved and generate that interest at an early age in STEM
education. Because you have to do it at an early age. I look
forward to the successful implementation of the competition,
and I hope it will encourage students to express that
creativity and interest in STEM for years to come.
So, Madam Chairman, thank you. I think this is a really
good idea, kind of like the arts competition program that we
have.
Thank you, and I yield back.
The Chairman. Thank you.
The Chairman. Any other Member have a comment?
I appreciate, Dr. Gingrey, your comments about the STEM. I
do think it is--first, it is sort of modeled after the Artistic
Discovery, from that perspective, which has been an incredible
success. There are over 300 Members of Congress now
participating in that.
And particularly now, when we look at STEM in that--you
know, I think the first thing is they are going to be
challenging the kids to do an app. I didn't even know what an
app was until a couple years ago. Now I have an app for that,
right?
And these kids are so unbelievably innovative that who
knows what they are going to come up with. So those kinds of
things, these kinds of things, I think, can really lead to
mentoring for them from the industry and other kinds of things
and really help bring our kids along in all of these
applications--the apps.
But, at any rate, I now call up and lay before the
committee Committee Resolution 113-6, to adopt regulations
concerning the House Academic Competition.

The Chairman. And, without objection, the first reading of
the resolution is dispensed with. And the resolution is
considered read and open for any amendment at any point.
Is there any debate on the resolution?
Are there any Members who want to offer an amendment to the
resolution?
If not, I move the committee adopt the resolution. And the
question is on the motion.
All those in favor will signify by saying aye.
Opposed will say nay.
In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The ayes
have it. The motion is agreed to.
And, without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid
upon the table.
And I would ask the committee for unanimous consent that
the staff be authorized to make technical and conforming
changes to the measure the committee just considered.
Without objection, so ordered.
And that concludes today's markup. And the markup portion
of this meeting is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:39 a.m., the committee proceeded to other
business.]
