UNITED STATES-JORDAN DEFENSE COOPERATION ACT OF 2014

----------

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2014

House of Representatives,

Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa,

Committee on Foreign Affairs,

Washington, DC.

The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:05 p.m., in
room 2172, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Ileana Ros-
Lehtinen (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Subcommittee will come to order. I know
that we will have votes pretty soon, so it is going to be a
little tricky to do all this, but we can.
Pursuant to notice, I call up the bill, H.R. 5648, the
United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Act of 2014, for
purposes of markup. Without objection, it will be considered as
read, and sections 1 through 3, the portions within this
committee's jurisdiction, are open for amendment at any point.
[The information referred to follows:]

Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. After opening remarks by me and the
ranking member, I will be glad to recognize any member seeking
recognition to speak on this bill.
As we know, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is one of the
greatest allies in the Middle East. In 1996, the United States
recognized the Kingdom as a major non-NATO ally. In 2000, the
United States and Jordan signed a free trade agreement that
went into effect in 2001. In 2010, the U.S. and Jordan signed a
$275 million compact through the Millennium Challenge
Corporation.
Not only have the bilateral ties between both nations been
strong, but Jordan continues to be a large player in regional
efforts. In the midst of the conflict in Syria and Iraq, Jordan
has played a central role to the international response to both
humanitarian crises. The United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees estimates that more than 600,000 Syrians have
registered as refugees in Jordan.
In addition, the Kingdom estimates that another 800,000
refugees--listen to those numbers--have been assimilated into
local communities outside the refugee camps, bringing the total
of Syrian refugees in Jordan to 1.4 million people. This amount
is in addition to the other refugees that Jordan has already
taken through the years from the West Bank and Iraq. The
population influx has put a severe strain on the infrastructure
and the economy of Jordan that is dangerously unsustainable.
In June, Ranking Member Ted Deutch and I had the pleasure
of visiting Jordan to witness firsthand the challenges that the
Kingdom is facing. The message that our delegation gave the
King was simple: The United States Congress supports Jordan, we
will continue to help ensure that Jordan remains stable,
because by providing stability, Jordan is an essential piece of
the United States' Middle East strategy and will continue to
play an important role in the many challenges that we face,
such as fighting terrorism from ISIL, stability in Iraq,
playing a role between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the peace treaty
between Jordan and Israel, and I hope that both nations can
work together to calm tensions currently in the region.
However, we must analyze the current situation on the ground
carefully and must be proactive in supporting our allies. We
cannot wait for the ISIL threat to directly arrive to Jordan's
doorstep for Congress to act. More needs to be done to bolster
the Kingdom's ability.
And I have more to say, but I know that time is short, so I
will now turn to my good friend, Congressman Ted Deutch, our
ranking member, for his opening remarks.
Mr. Deutch. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I appreciate the
opportunity. I know how hard you worked on this legislation.
This is a bill that clearly highlights the importance of
regional cooperation with Jordan. And because I know we are
short on time and out of respect for our colleagues, I would
like to give them the opportunity to speak, I will yield back
the balance of my time.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you very much. I should have
yielded way before also. What was I thinking?
Mr. Chabot of Ohio is recognized.
Mr. Chabot. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. I get choked up just thinking about you,
Steve.
Mr. Chabot. I appreciate that, and I will be very brief. I
just want to commend you for bringing this legislation before
the subcommittee today. Jordan is a longtime friend and ally of
the United States and sits in a very dangerous part of the
world. Over the years, it has taken in refugees from throughout
the region, whether it be the Palestinians or Iraqis or most
recently Syrians who have fled the hostilities in that
beleaguered nation.
This measure recognizes those realities and reasserts our
support for a continued strong alliance with our Jordanian
ally. It is a timely measure, and I would urge its adoption.
Thank you for bringing it forward.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you, Mr. Chabot.
Mr. Connolly.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
The United States and the Kingdom of Jordan have a long and
close collaborative relationship. It has promoted our national
security and regional stability for many years. Jordan is a
major non-NATO ally and a nonpermanent member of the U.N.
Security Council. It has been the recipient of funding from
several U.S. foreign assistance programs over decades. They are
an essential player in the region from our point of view,
obviously. I commend the work you have done, and I would ask
that the balance of my statement be entered into the record in
full.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Without objection, all members'
statements will be made a part of the record.
Senator Cotton is recognized.
Mr. Cotton. I yield back the balance of my time in a manner
very unfitting of a Senator-elect.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. I know. You will rue the day. You will
never do that again.
Mr. Connolly.I have never heard a Senator do that, Madam
Chairman, ever.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Unprecedented.
And so, Mr. Kinzinger, we will go to you then, sir.
Mr. Kinzinger. I have no statement. I also yield back.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Okay. Thank you.
Mr. DeSantis.
Mr. DeSantis. Yield back to you, Madam Chair.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Dr. Yoho.
Mr. Yoho. I yield back also.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Oh, boy, oh, boy. The pressure is on, Mr.
Schneider. Please speak.
Mr. Schneider. Thank you. I will just add the comments and
associate with what has already been said. Jordan is a key ally
in a critical region, and we need to make sure they have the
support they need to deal with the many crises they face. Thank
you for calling this hearing and introducing this legislation.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you, sir. We will miss you. But we
still are not done. We will be meeting once again. Thank you,
Brad.
And Ms. Meng is recognized.
Ms. Meng. I have no statement, Madam Chairwoman. I yield
back my time.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you.
Mr. Vargas.
Mr. Vargas. As a lowly freshman, I will yield back.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Well, thank you so much. Oh, I am so
sorry, Mr. Higgins.
Mr. Higgins. I just walked in.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Oh, I apologize. Thank you, Mr. Higgins.
Mr. Higgins. I will yield back.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. All right. Thank you.
So no other members seek recognition to speak on the bill.
Are there any amendments? Hearing no further amendments, the
Chair moves to report the bill favorably to the full committee.
All in favor, say aye.
All opposed, no.
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. The motion
is approved. The bill is reported favorably to the full
committee with thanks to my colleagues for their support, their
input, cooperation. That concludes today's markup, and the
subcommittee stands adjourned, but we will reconvene right
after votes. Not right now, Mr. Acevedo? After votes. Darn it.
Too bad. We could get some stuff done before. Who needs those
witnesses.
No, just kidding. Thank you very much. So the subcommittee
is adjourned, and we will come back after the votes. Thank you.

[Whereupon, at 2:10 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
