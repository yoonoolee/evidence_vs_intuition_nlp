FISCAL YEAR 2015 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BUDGET REQUEST FOR
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

----------

House of Representatives,
Committee on Armed Services,
Subcommittee on Intelligence, Emerging
Threats and Capabilities,
Washington, DC, Friday, April 4, 2014.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 11:00 a.m., in
room 2212, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Mac Thornberry
(chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MAC THORNBERRY, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM
TEXAS, CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE, EMERGING THREATS
AND CAPABILITIES

Mr. Thornberry. Hearing will come to order.
Today is the first of two events the subcommittee is
hosting related to the fiscal year 2015 defense intelligence
budget.
Today we will hear from the Under Secretary of Defense for
Intelligence as well as the heads of the DIA [Defense
Intelligence Agency], NSA [National Security Agency], and NGA
[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]. Next week we will
hold a second session with the senior intelligence officers of
each of the military services as well as Special Operations
Command.
Armed Services Committee continues to be focused on making
sure that our warfighters have the best possible intelligence
support.
DIA, NSA, and NGA are each combat support agencies, and we
have asked them to describe today their efforts to support
current military operations as well as to help the Department
of Defense [DOD] anticipate and prepare for future conflicts.
Each of these agencies is part of the Intelligence
Community and has responsibilities to both the larger U.S.
Government and to the Department of Defense. That is a delicate
balance, and both missions are critical to our Nation.
Over the past year, we have been presented with numerous
additional challenges, whether it is the current crisis in
Ukraine, ongoing military operations against terrorist groups,
or mitigating the most serious compromise of classified
information in U.S. history.
Intelligence and the protection of that intelligence
continues to be one of the most important parts of our national
defense.
Let me yield to the distinguished ranking member for any
opening comments he would like to make.

STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES R. LANGEVIN, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM
RHODE ISLAND, RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE,
EMERGING THREATS AND CAPABILITIES

Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I want to thank our witnesses for being here today.
I especially want to thank Chairman Thornberry for
organizing and putting together this very important hearing.
I hope that today's discussion will be both productive and
constructive as we continue to exercise this subcommittee's new
oversight responsibilities relating to the intelligence
portfolio for which the Armed Services Committee has oversight
responsibilities for.
First and, unfortunately, foremost, of course, I continue
to be concerned about the implications and ramifications to the
Department from the leaks of the NSA contractor. I have read
the information review task force report. It was an essential
assessment and a very sobering one, indeed.
However, I would like to get a better idea of what we know
now and what we don't know and what we are going to do about
it.
After all, as DNI [Director of National Intelligence]
Clapper testified before the Intelligence Committee, the vast
majority of the information comprised has nothing to do with
NSA surveillance and collection, but, instead, has dire impacts
directly on DOD.
I am very concerned about the damage assessment and the
practical effects of these leaks on our men and women in
uniform who are at risk each day, but just as important is the
way forward on mitigation.
We certainly don't need to scrap every operations plan, but
we do need to look at shifting some Department priorities and
policies. And I would appreciate you speaking to the magnitude
of what we will have to face in the coming years.
I am also interested in the progress of the Defense
Clandestine Service [DCS] and its ability to meet strategic
defense priorities.
I know that the Defense Clandestine Service is not new to
DIA, but certainly it is--under General Flynn's direction and
that of Secretary Vickers, has enhanced its capabilities. I am
looking forward to getting an update on that.
There have been some growing pains, but I strongly believe
the DOD must maintain a clandestine human capability, which I
have to say is sometimes challenged in the Intelligence
Committee.
How is DCS progressing and improving its capabilities,
refining its requirements, moving officers into places where
they can be most effective, and integrating and coordinating
with others in the Intelligence Community?
From a budget perspective, money above the Budget Control
Act [BCA] levels via the Bipartisan Budget Act was given back
largely to the services. This puts a particular strain on
agencies like yours.
We are going to have to take some risk, but there is a
breaking point. As your partners on the Hill, we would like to
help you avoid that breaking point and manage your risk
wherever possible.
We would also appreciate the benefits of your perspective
on particular cuts in other parts of the Department that could
impair your activities such as the COCOMs [combatant commands].
And, finally and fittingly, given today's hearing on the
QDR--given yesterday's hearing on the QDR [Quadrennial Defense
Review], I would like to discuss the overall defense strategy
implications to intelligence.
When the Department looks out over the next decade, is the
defense intelligence apparatus correctly postured to meet our
operational priorities? And is it correctly aligned to cover
the globe, operate where we need, and operate to sustain our
counterterrorism operations?
So, with that, Mr. Chairman, I would like to again thank
you for holding this very important hearing.
To our witnesses, thank you again for your appearance today
and your service to the Nation. I certainly look forward to our
continued and productive relationship as we work together to
ensure the best intelligence posture for the Nation.
Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Thornberry. Thank the gentleman.
I want to welcome our witnesses: Dr. Michael Vickers, Under
Secretary of Defense for Intelligence; General Michael Flynn,
Director of Defense Intelligence Agency; Ms. Letitia Long,
Director of National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; and Mr.
Richard Ledgett, the Deputy Director of the National Security
Agency.
We will start with unclassified opening statements from
each of our witnesses and then reconvene in a classified
setting next door, where each witness will then be able to make
brief classified remarks, followed by Members' questions.
Dr. Vickers, the floor is yours.

STATEMENT OF DR. MICHAEL G. VICKERS, UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
FOR INTELLIGENCE

Dr. Vickers. Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Langevin,
distinguished members of the subcommittee, I appreciate the
opportunity to come before you today to discuss the fiscal year
2015 budget requests for defense intelligence.
I am especially pleased to be here with Mike, Tish, and
Rick. Betty Sapp, our director of the National Reconnaissance
Office, testified yesterday before the Strategic Forces
Subcommittee.
While the unclassified nature of our opening remarks keeps
us from discussing in detail many aspects of defense
intelligence, we look forward to meeting in closed session to
discuss these topics more fully.
Intelligence is a major source of U.S. advantage. It
informs wise policy and enables precision operations. It is our
front line of defense.
The challenges we face, however, are increasing and
becoming more complex, and our resources are declining. It is
imperative, therefore, that we make the best use of available
resources, given the challenges we confront.
As the USDI [Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence],
I am the program executive for the Military Intelligence
Program [MIP] and have oversight over the related programs that
comprise what we call the Battlespace Awareness [BA] portfolio.
The Department's fiscal year 2015 MIP budget request for
base appropriations is $13.3 billion, which does not include
overseas contingency operations funds. The BA portfolio
includes significant additional resources.
Defense intelligence collectively encompasses the defense
portion of the National Intelligence Program, the MIP, and the
BA portfolio.
My close relationship with DNI Clapper enables DOD and the
Intelligence Community to work seamlessly to manage, resource,
and apply our intelligence capabilities in pursuit of our
national security objectives while avoiding duplication of
effort.
We have five defense intelligence operational priorities:
Countering terrorism, particularly countering the threat posed
by Al Qaeda; countering the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and associated delivery systems; countering the
actions of repressive governments against their people, such as
in Syria; countering state-on-state aggression; and countering
cyber threats.
To address the intelligence gaps that exist within these
operational priority areas, we are focused on enhancing defense
intelligence capabilities in five areas: Enhancing global
coverage; improving our ability to operate in anti-access/area
denial, or A2/AD, environments; sustaining counterterrorism and
counter-proliferation capabilities; continuing to develop our
cyber operations capabilities; and strengthening our
counterintelligence capabilities and reforming our security
clearances processes to minimize insider threats.
All four of us are committed to working with the Congress
to find the best way to continue to deliver intelligence
advantage to our Nation and our warfighters.
I thank you for the opportunity to address this
subcommittee today, and turn now to my colleagues to address
what they are doing within their individual agencies to further
our defense intelligence goals.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Vickers can be found in the
Appendix on page 15.]
Mr. Thornberry. General Flynn.

STATEMENT OF LTG MICHAEL T. FLYNN, USA, DIRECTOR, DEFENSE
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

General Flynn. Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member
Langevin, and members of the subcommittee, on behalf of the men
and women of the Defense Intelligence Agency, I want to say
thank you for your invitation to present our fiscal year 2015
budget request.
Let me begin by saying I fully support the priorities Under
Secretary Vickers outlined in his remarks. As you have recently
heard from Admirals McRaven and Locklear and Generals Rodriguez
and Austin during their appearances before the full committee
earlier this year, the need for more timely and accurate
intelligence continues to exponentially grow.
Persistent crisis in the Middle East and recent
developments in Crimea, Central Africa, and the Asia-Pacific
region underscore the constant drumbeat for more fighters,
commanders, and policymakers for specialized understanding and
insight into the countless threats and military capabilities
around the world.
Both you and I have a responsibility to our men and women
to make smart decisions in these austere times to take risks
where we must, but, also, maintain those investments which will
ensure our security well into the future.
DIA has made significant changes to manage risk to ensure
that we will continue to meet the increasing operational needs
and strategic challenges that threaten our military advantage.
During my testimony this morning, I will highlight four
critical priorities in our request: Number one, intelligence
collection operations; number two, all-source analysis; number
three, investments in our workforce for professional
development and career-broadening experiences; and, number
four, how we have reshaped much of our business practices and
process.
First, within intelligence collection operations, ensuring
the success of the Defense Clandestine Service is a priority
not only for DIA, but for the Defense Department and the
Intelligence Community as a whole.
Your oversight and support have helped DCS mature as a
human intelligence capability and make measurable progress in
support of all defense intelligence equities.
On all measures--tradecraft, professionalization, and both
the quantity and quality of recruitments--we have experienced a
marked increase in performance this past year.
In terms of counterintelligence, this is another critical
investment for DIA. Recent events remind us that accepting too
much risk in the CI--or in counterintelligence realm can come
at an unacceptable cost.
Our budget request focuses our CI investments on creating a
holistic strategy that addresses traditional
counterintelligence, increases network monitoring, improves
insider threat identification, and fortifies a security-
conscious culture within our workforce.
Second, all-source analysis is a core mission of DIA and
rightly comprises one of the largest portions of our budget. We
are implementing new solutions to mitigate global coverage
risks, particularly by forging closer ties to the combatant
command Joint Intelligence Operations Centers, or JIOCs,
through the Agency's five Intelligence Integration Centers.
Our integrated centers fuse our analytic and collections
workforce to maximize enterprise support to operational
decisionmaking and strategic policy.
While only in their first year of operation, our combined
performance in response to the recent crisis in Ukraine, flash
points in the South China Sea, instability in Sub-Sahara
Africa, and the ongoing civil war in Syria, highlight the
benefit of multifaceted integration and collaboration as well
as a strong lash-up with the combatant command JIOCs.
Third, over the past year, we have increased our
investments in our workforce professional development programs
as well as career-broadening experiences.
In terms of professional development, we consolidated 21
separate offices into one Academy of Defense Intelligence,
realizing an immediate cost savings of $3 million.
Additionally, through our Office of Defense Intelligence,
we have reemphasized enhanced training for our analytic
workforce through our new Professional Analyst Career Education
program.
In terms of career-broadening experiences, this past year
we rotated 225 DIA and combatant command personnel overseas and
plan on an additional 320 personnel for fiscal year 2015,
further integrating the Defense Intelligence Enterprise.
Lastly, to further prepare our workforce for an uncertain
future, we have also consolidated three of our military
Reserves offices and over 1,200 reservist billets under one
two-star component.
The impact of all of these changes has already seen an
improvement in analytic production, a decrease in contract
instructors, and an increase in the number of man-days we get
out of our Reserve intelligence component.
Fourth, we are taking steps to significantly improve our
contracting business processes with a ``Start Small, Scale
Fast, Fail Cheap'' strategy that reduces risks, shortens
delivery time by 6 to 9 months, and mitigates the ``too big to
fail'' trap that we typically get ourselves into.
We are particularly proud of our work with small
businesses, which are generating the original ideas we need for
the future. The Federal Government average of small business
contracting is less than 25 percent, but at DIA, over the past
year, we have nearly doubled our investments in small
businesses, reaching a new high of 31 percent. And now nearly 1
out of every $3 that we invest is invested in small business.
As you review our overall budget request, you will find
that we have made the hard choices and the right investments to
ensure that our fully integrated defense intelligence team of
highly skilled professionals is equipped with the right
training and technology, strengthened by partnerships across
the whole of government and around the world. And we will
continue to provide all-source defense intelligence whenever
and wherever required in support of our warfighters.
I thank you for your continued support and look forward to
your questions.
[The prepared statement of General Flynn can be found in
the Appendix on page 22.]
Mr. Thornberry. Thank you.
Ms. Long.

STATEMENT OF LETITIA A. LONG, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL-
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

Ms. Long. Good morning, Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member
Langevin, and distinguished members of the subcommittee.
Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Program and the NGA MIP budget request
for fiscal year 2015. Thank you also for your continued support
to enhance defense intelligence.
Pleased to appear before you today with Dr. Vickers and my
fellow directors. In my more than 30 years of working in
defense intelligence, the cooperation and collaboration between
our agencies has never been stronger.
Geospatial Intelligence, or GEOINT, is the analysis of
information from a number of unique and highly technical
sources that describe, assess, and visually depict physical
features and geographically referenced activities on earth,
GEOINT has always been integral to military operations
around the world, and today it is one of the drivers for
intelligence integration because everything in the world is
someplace at some time.
As the lead Federal agency for GEOINT, NGA provides this
critical information to the defense community, military
commanders, decisionmakers, troops deployed in harm's way, and
first responders.
Our content, analysis, and services enable mission
planning, combat operations, strategic warning, precision
targeting, counterterrorism operations, counter-proliferation,
GPS [global positioning system] navigation, and humanitarian
assistance and disaster response.
As an example, NGA produces and sustains global
aeronautical and maritime safety of navigation information for
military flight crews and sailors as well as civil mariners.
This effort includes updating electronic records on more
than 45,000 airfields, charting more than 116 million square
miles of ocean, and managing data on over 3 billion topographic
features worldwide.
The bottom line is, without this information, our ships
would stay in port, our pilots would not fly, and our ground
forces would not leave garrisons.
A second example of the contribution of GEOINT is the
integrated temporal and spatial view of the battlespace that
NGA provides to combatant commanders and policymakers.
By identifying threat force capabilities, locations,
patterns of activities, relationships, and infrastructure
around the globe, NGA helps the commanders and policymakers
hold adversaries at risk.
To support these types of missions, NGA personnel deploy
all over the world, embedded alongside our military and
intelligence personnel, and participate in mission planning,
executions, and follow-up.
In sum, the intelligence that NGA provides every day is
critical to the planning and operations of intelligence
agencies and military units fighting to protect all Americans.
In the broadest terms, the vision that drives NGA's
workforce is putting the best GEOINT in the hands of our
soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen.
We continuously seek to produce new value for warfighters,
whether through a map, imagery and technical analysis, or a
specialized interactive product.
Looking ahead, NGA's budget request includes funding for
expanding our analytic capabilities and next-generation
collection strategies to anticipate evolving national security
threats, shaping and retaining a skilled and diverse workforce,
and enhancing protections against cyber and insider threats to
keep our information and our people safe.
These investments are aligned with a number of long-term
strategic initiatives that NGA is pursuing to improve our
contributions to the warfighter and the Intelligence Community
as a whole, including better intelligence integration,
providing better access to our data, especially for the
warfighter, and enhancing analytic tradecraft to discover key
unknowns hidden in the masses of data.
In addition to these strategic initiatives, which focus on
the long-term success of the Agency, we have kept a close eye
on the more immediate risks, from Russia and Ukraine, to Iran,
North Korea, and China, to Syria, Afghanistan, and
counterterrorism operations as well.
Finally, I want to mention NGA's progress toward financial
auditability. The Agency is undergoing our first full-scope
audit of our 2014 financial statements, and the results from
this audit will help us identify areas requiring additional
remediation as we move toward our goal of achieving an
unqualified opinion on our 2016 financial statements.
On behalf of the women and men of NGA, thank you for your
support.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Long can be found in the
Appendix on page 29.]
Mr. Thornberry. Thank you.
Mr. Ledgett.

STATEMENT OF RICHARD H. LEDGETT, JR., DEPUTY DIRECTOR, NATIONAL
SECURITY AGENCY

Mr. Ledgett. Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Langevin,
distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for the
opportunity to address you today.
And on behalf of the outstanding men and women of the
National Security Agency and Central Security Service [NSA/
CSS], thank you for your support that the Congress and this
committee in particular give to NSA/CSS.
Your support makes it possible for us to provide actionable
intelligence and information assurance expertise to our diverse
customer set, especially the combatant commanders and our
military personnel in harm's way.
With your continued support in fiscal year 2015, we will
continue to do all we can to protect the Nation and its allies.
Our 2015 NSA/CSS budget reflects hard choices to ensure
critical national security requirements are addressed in an era
of declining budgets.
The strategic environment we face will continue to become
more complex and present a dramatically new set of challenges.
Cyber attacks will allow potential adversaries to overcome
U.S. advantages in conventional military power. The Nation will
continue to depend upon NSA's cryptanalysis to sustain our
access and understanding of foreign communications, even as
encryption becomes more automatic and more prolific.
We must support our warfighters, policymakers, and allies
today while preparing for the future through the development of
next-generation capabilities all while scrupulously protecting
privacy and civil liberties.
Our fiscal year 2015 budget, while accepting risks mandated
by the current fiscal climate, keeps us on the path to
accomplish these goals.
We have recruited and trained an extraordinarily talented
workforce, and the fiscal year 2015 budget allows us to
preserve it.
We are leveraging our human capital by providing our people
with the most technologically sophisticated and innovative
intelligence capabilities.
Investments in cybersecurity will expand across the
enterprise to meet the demand and speed of action required in
today's world.
As you know, NSA executes three distinct funding streams:
The Consolidated Cryptologic Program, or CCP; the Information
Systems Security Program, or ISSP; and the Military
Intelligence Program, or MIP. Let me briefly describe our
emphasis areas in each of these.
The CCP enables NSA/CSS to bring the capability of a global
cryptologic system to bear in support of our national
policymakers and our warfighting commands. NSA's global
intelligence capabilities, cryptanalytic and analytic
tradecraft, operational infrastructure, and reporting
mechanisms have been developed over time and have resulted in
the successful delivery of mission requirements.
And I look forward to providing some specific and recent
examples in the classified session that will follow.
NSA/CSS's information assurance investment plan responds to
the challenges of providing security solutions that keep pace
with a fast-moving technology sector and agile adversaries.
We must know the cyberspace environment and its risks,
protecting information and hardening systems in the national
security cyber domain.
This will ensure that systems have the required security
characteristics commensurate with known and anticipated risks
and the ability to withstand and recover from cyber attacks and
intrusions.
We are continuously refining our strategies to provide
know-how and technology to suppliers and clients and to
measurably improve the security of critical operations and
information.
NSA/CSS's Military Intelligence Program investment plan
focuses on delivering responsive, reliable, and effective
SIGINT, or signals intelligence, to ensure our deployed forces
can succeed in today's operations and are prepared to respond
to future threats and technologies.
The NSA/CSS MIP continues previous investments to improve
DOD intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities,
providing timely and accurate support to our deployed forces,
achieving interoperability, commonality, and modernization of
service and U.S. Special Operations Command signals
intelligence ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance] capabilities.
NSA/CSS will also continue to support an effective joint
tactical system that provides SIGINT access to targets that use
the global converged communications infrastructure.
The MIP investments strengthen the Department's ability to
address current cyber challenges. Specifically, fiscal year
2015 investment will focus on the development of a strong cyber
workforce and intelligence gathering in cyberspace.
These initiatives will focus on providing U.S. Cyber
Command Cyber Mission Force support, personnel training, and
threat operations support and infrastructure.
We will also continue investing in the research and
development of solutions that produce actionable signals
intelligence for deployed forces.
We will be responsive to the needs for intelligence support
to combatant commands, including support to the development of
operations plans and theater campaign plans, as directed by the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
I will conclude by saying that the NSA/CSS budget request
reflects the necessary balance between today's fiscal realities
and our unwavering commitment to support of the joint
warfighter.
Thank you for your continued support in helping NSA/CSS
maintain world-class capabilities and serve as a key
contributor to the protection of our Nation.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Ledgett can be found in the
Appendix on page 36.]
Mr. Thornberry. Thank you all.
We will immediately reconvene next door. And, with that,
the open hearing stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:29 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
