COMMITTEE ORGANIZATION

----------

House of Representatives,
Committee on Armed Services,
Washington, DC, Tuesday, January 15, 2013.
The committee met, pursuant to call, at 11:30 a.m., in room
2118, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Howard P. ``Buck''
McKeon (chairman of the committee) presiding.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HOWARD P. ``BUCK'' MCKEON, A
REPRESENTATIVE FROM CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON ARMED
SERVICES

The Chairman. The committee will come to order. We have
four items of official business to consider today: the adoption
of the committee's oversight plan; approval of the rules;
approval of the committee's security procedures; and the
appointment of committee staff.
Good morning to all of you. Let me first welcome our new
Members returning and new to the House Armed Services Committee
[HASC]. We have a full schedule today, so I will only make
brief comments at this point. First, I want to reiterate the
pledge I made when I was named chairman to continue this
committee's longstanding bipartisan tradition in the
furtherance of a strong national defense.
We will certainly have areas of disagreement, but the
security challenges facing our Nation require that we find
solutions and not merely prolonged political debate. I think in
the last couple of years, our committee has probably been the
only one that has passed major legislation that has reached its
way to the President's desk, and even though it was late, it
was signed into law. So we want to continue that tradition. And
the Members that have been here before, I think, understand
that those are not just words; that we actually--that that is
what we do.
Second, our armed services are being tested in the field on
a daily basis. They are completing their mission, and we must
as well. Our mission is enshrined in the Constitution. We are
charged with providing for the common defense, and as the
plaque in front of this rostrum reminds us, Article I, Section
8, of the Constitution further affirms that Congress shall have
the power to raise and support armies, to provide and maintain
a navy, to make rules for the government and regulation of the
land and naval forces.
This is a heavy responsibility, and it is particularly
weighty in a time of war and fiscal austerity. Nevertheless, it
is the job of this committee to ensure that our men and women
in uniform are properly trained, resourced, equipped, and
supported so that they can fulfill not just today's missions
but future missions and return safely to their families and
loved ones.
Lastly, I know it will come as no surprise to most of you,
but the committee will become very busy in the weeks and months
ahead. Although there is significant uncertainty regarding many
issues facing the committee, not the least of which is the
threat of defense sequestration, the one thing our troops and
their families have been able to rely on for the last 51 years
is that Congress will deliver a defense authorization bill. And
it is with that in mind that I remain committed to moving
forward with a strong national defense authorization bill and
to provide the oversight that the Nation demands of us. I will
be informed by your views, too, and will both encourage and
expect your participation. We have a lot to do. We are the
largest committee in Congress. I welcome any and all Member
ideas and participation in the issues that we need to cover.
Before I turn to Ranking Member Smith for his thoughts and
before we introduce our new slate of Members, I want to take a
moment to note that last week, America lost a selfless servant
and a true hero. Doug Roach, a member of our committee staff,
was more than a member of the staff. He was an institution. He
came to the staff in 1991. While we are deeply saddened by his
loss, each of us had come to rely on Doug's counsel and
guidance on a variety of issues, and he always gave it to us
straight, without regard to politics or parochial interests. He
was trusted and admired by Republicans and Democrats alike. He
was a man of noble virtue, a tough fighter pilot. We are
checking this out, but he flew 516 combat missions in Vietnam,
and we think that that was more than any other pilot. He also
flew two missions two different times with the Thunderbirds.
But he was also known for his acts of kindness. Doug
committed every waking moment of service to his country; first,
in the United States Air Force, and later, to this committee,
where, as I said, he has served since 1991. He was a selfless
man who worked very hard right up to the end. We will all have
an opportunity next Tuesday evening. We are going to here in
this room, at 6:00, have a memorial for him. More information
on that will follow.
But for now, I just ask you if you will join me in a moment
of silence in memory of Doug.
[Moment of silence observed.]
The Chairman. Thank you very much. Ranking Member Smith.

STATEMENT OF HON. ADAM SMITH, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM WASHINGTON,
RANKING MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES

Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to begin by echoing your comments about Doug. He
was, you know, a good friend and just an incredible American.
His service to the country and the Air Force and then his
service on this committee, he represented the best of what we
all, you know, aspire to as public servants, absolutely
dedicated to this country, absolutely dedicated to doing his
job well, and nobody knew more about how this place ran than
Doug.
And the thing I really admired about him is he took the
time to work with all of us as Members as well, you know,
whether you were a freshman Member or whoever you were, he was
so passionate about what he did, he would love to have the
opportunity to explain it to absolutely anyone who was willing
to listen. On issue after issue, he dove in, and had an
unbelievable understanding of those issues. And it was always
about, you know, defending this country and making sure the
American taxpayers got their money's worth.
It was a great, great pleasure to work with him, and as the
chairman said, he personified also what this committee is
about, bipartisan. He worked for Democrats. He worked for
Republicans, back and forth. That didn't matter. The issues
mattered, and the country mattered. And he will be sorely
missed on this committee.
So I thank you for taking the time to say a couple of words
about him, and we will look forward to honoring him next
Tuesday as a committee. So thank you for that.
And thank you for starting us off here in the 113th
Congress. I want to start by thanking Chairman McKeon for the
job that he has done as chairman of this committee. I could not
ask for a better partner to work with. As the chairman
mentioned, we pride ourselves in this committee on being
bipartisan and on getting our job done; things that are
increasingly rare in this institution, and it really, it starts
with the chairman.
I have been through a number of chairmen during my 16 years
in this Congress. Every single one has made a priority to make
sure that we maintain that tradition, the bipartisan tradition,
the focus on national security.
And Buck, you have done an outstanding job of continuing
that. You have made me a full partner in our effort here, and I
really appreciate that. And it is that type of leadership that
will keep that tradition going.
As you mentioned, for 51 straight years, we have passed our
bill. And it is not a small bill, 1,600 pages, $633 billion
this last year, and it has incredibly important policy
contained in that. And to get that done, we have to compromise.
We have to work with the Senate, my goodness.
So we work with each other. We work with the Senate. It is
not easy, but it gets done, and it makes an enormous
difference, first and foremost, for the men and women who serve
in the military. Giving them some consistent legal support is
incredibly important, and we do that. So I am very, very proud
of that, proud of the tradition.
I welcome back the Members who have been here. We have a
very large group of new Members, and I will say you are all
very lucky. You are all what in my opinion is the best
committee in Congress. So we are very, very happy to have you.
And I look forward to having, hopefully, knock on wood, another
productive year on this committee.
Again, I thank the chairman for his leadership. I want to
close, I guess, by, you know, where I started, and the other
part about this committee is the staff makes it happen. You
know, Doug personified that, but he is not alone. As you look
around you, these are the people who do the work that help us
get to the point where we get that bill done. There is depth of
knowledge in here that I urge every Member, both new and old,
to take advantage of and work with the staff. They make an
incredible difference for this committee and for this country.
And with that, I will yield back.
The Chairman. Thank you, let me introduce the very large
and impressive team joining with us. I will introduce the
Republicans, and Adam can introduce the Democrats. Their
backgrounds will benefit our committee, the military services
and most importantly, the men and women of the Armed Forces and
their families.
First, I would like to welcome Rob Bishop back. He is from
the First District of Utah. He has been a trusted friend, a
leader on HASC issues. He took a leave of absence last term to
serve, again, on the Rules Committee. His district includes
Hill Air Force Base and key defense employers. Although we will
miss his support from the Rules Committee during the
consideration of the NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act],
we would rather have him back home here with us.
Welcome back, Rob.
Our first new House Member is Rich Nugent, representing the
11th District of Florida. This is his second term in Congress.
Prior to his first term in the House last Congress, Rich was
sheriff of Hernando County, Florida. He has three sons in the
Army who have served combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. The
committee will benefit from his expertise as both a former
member of the Air National Guard and a military parent.
Welcome.
From the great State of South Dakota, we welcome Kristi
Noem. She is at-large Representative for the Mount Rushmore
State. Kristi's State is home to Ellsworth Air Force Base and
several other military installations. She is a farmer, a
rancher, small business owner, and served in the South Dakota
House of Representatives.
Welcome.
From the Eighth District of California, my neighbor, who
represents a big part of what I represented for the last 10
years, we welcome Paul Cook. Paul's district includes several
military installations that I know very well, Fort Irwin, 29
Palms, the Marine Corps Logistics Base at Barstow, the Marine
Mountain Warfare Center and others. Paul served in the U.S.
Marine Corps for 26 years. He is an infantry officer, retired
colonel, the winner of the Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts.
So he will bring a great perspective to our committee.
Welcome.
From the First District of Oklahoma, we welcome Jim
Bridenstine. Jim's district is based in Tulsa. He is a
lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy. He served nearly 10
years Active Duty service and is still a reservist. He is a
naval aviator who flew E-2C Hawkeyes in Central and South
America as part of drug interdiction mission. We look forward
to Jim bringing his experience to the committee.
From the Second District of Ohio, Brad Wenstrup. Brad has
served in the U.S. Army Reserve Medical Corps. He is a
lieutenant colonel and served 1 year of Active Duty in Iraq as
a combat surgeon. We are looking forward to having his
perspective on the HASC.
And finally, I would like to introduce Jackie Walorski,
from the Second District of Indiana, based in South Bend.
Jackie's district is home to Grissom Air Force Base and several
industry partners who help to sustain our troops, including the
production of equipment like the Humvee. Jackie served three
terms in the Indiana General Assembly before joining the House.
Welcome, Jackie.
We are fortunate to have such a talented group join our
team here at the committee.
And I would now like to recognize Ranking Member Smith to
introduce the Democratic Members.
Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We, too, have a large contingency this time. Two years ago,
it was a little lopsided, I must say, so it is good that we
have a good group of new Democrats coming on the committee as
well.
And we will start with Andre Carson, who is not a new
Member of Congress. He is a new Member to the committee. He
was, you know, got interested in public service because of
someone who I served with, came to Congress with, his
grandmother, Julia Carson. He started his profession as a law
enforcement officer, served as an investigator for the Indiana
State Excise Police for 9 years, later joined the Indiana
Department of Homeland Security and was detailed to an
intelligence fusion center, supervising an antiterrorism unit.
Welcome to the committee. Happy to have you on board.
Carol Shea-Porter is a Member who is coming back to our
committee, served for one term from 2008-2010, so has great
experience, from the State of New Hampshire, I should point
out, so we appreciate having her back on the committee. She has
worked on a number of very important issues in Armed Services.
We appreciate having the experience.
Dan Maffei from New York, well, I believe you coined the
phrase, a red-shirt freshman, which I thought was very clever.
So he is back, but he is new to this committee, represents
upstate New York. He has served as a Representative for two
different congressional districts now in New York. I think most
importantly, he has also worked as a staffer for Congress. As I
mentioned in my opening remarks, I think that is the talent and
skills that are most necessary to be success here. So we are
very happy to have Dan back.
Derek Kilmer, from the State of Washington, happy to have
another Washingtonian on the committee. Derek served in both
the State House and the State Senate. He has the unenviable
task of taking over for Norm Dicks, but he is more than up to
it. And the district that he represents has a very strong
national security presence with the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard,
and Bangor Submarine Base, as well as a number of contractors
and others. I believe the Navy is the largest employer in the
Sixth District the State of Washington.
So welcome. Happy to have you with us.
Joaquin Castro is from Texas, represents San Antonio,
previously served in the State legislature there. San Antonio
is home to Lackland Air Force Base; again, a large number of
defense contractors, very critical to our defense industry.
So happy to have your perspective. Texas is going to be
well represented on this committee as well.
And we have Tammy Duckworth, who I think most of us know.
She worked in the Administration as Assistant Secretary for
Public and Intergovernmental Affairs, the United States
Department of Veterans Affairs, has been a tireless advocate
for veterans, and is an Iraq war veteran herself, and I think
is going to bring just a wealth of experience to this committee
based on her service for veterans and for active duty.
We are very, very happy to have you on the committee.
Scott Peters is a newly elected Congressman representing
California's 52nd District down in San Diego, and he was
previously on the San Diego City Council and the first person
to hold the post of President of the City Council and he has
also served on the Commission for the Unified Port of San Diego
before becoming a Member of Congress. Obviously, the Navy ship
industry is huge down in San Diego so that perspective will be
very much appreciated.
Bill Enyart from Illinois is newly elected for Illinois's
12th District. He is a former attorney in the Adjutant General
of Illinois, served in the U.S. Air Force before joining the
Illinois Army National Guard in 1982, holding the rank of major
general. He was appointed to lead the National Guard and the
Illinois Department of Military Affairs as the 37th adjutant
general in 2007. He retired from the military in 2012.
Welcome to the Armed Services Committee. Great to have you
on board.
Again, Texas, Pete Gallego, newly elected for Texas' 23rd
Congressional District, served as a member of the Texas House
of Representatives from the 74th District, based around his
native Alpine, Texas, and obviously, as can you tell from the
membership of the committee, Texas is incredibly important to
our national security, a ton of bases, a ton of defense
contractors there.
Welcome as well.
And one more from the great State of Texas, Marc Veasey, a
freshman from Texas' newly created 33rd Congressional District,
served in the Texas House of Representatives before that. The
district is centered around the Fort Worth area, where, you
know, Bell Helicopter, Lockheed F-35, and a lot of very
important stuff going on down there for our national security.
So we have great new Representatives on both sides of the
aisle.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome all to our committee.
The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Smith.
And to the new Members, I join Adam and welcome you all to
the committee. I look forward to working with you. I think you
will find service on this committee very rewarding, and we
should have a great time this year working together.
Okay, on to the business. For those of you who are new, we
try to get through this as expeditiously as possible. I talk as
quickly as I can. And if you don't talk a whole lot, we will
not delay your day very much here.
Now, on to the business. I call up Committee Resolution No.
1 regarding the committee rules for the 113th Congress. The
clerk shall read the resolution.
Mr. Zakheim. Committee Resolution No. 1. Resolved, that the
Committee on Armed Services, U.S. House of Representatives,
adopt the committee rules for the 113th Congress, which are
stated in the copy before each Member.

The Chairman. The proposed committee rules have been
developed jointly with Ranking Member Smith and subsequently
provided to all Members' offices on Friday, January 11th.
Following consultation with Mr. Smith, I ask unanimous
consent that the resolution be considered as read and that the
resolution be open to amendment at any point.
Is there objection?
Without objection, it is ordered.
There are a few proposed changes to the committee rules
from the 112th Congress. First, the proposed rules include one
change made by the new Rules of the House, which now require
the committee to submit two activity reports per Congress,
instead of four.
Second, the proposed rules would update the jurisdiction of
certain subcommittees. For three subcommittees the proposed
rules would add jurisdiction over sustainment accounts
associated with weapons systems for which each subcommittee
already oversees procurement. This change would apply to the
subcommittees on Tactical Air and Land Forces, Seapower and
Projection Forces, and Strategic Forces.
Readiness jurisdiction remains unchanged from the previous
Congress and retains jurisdiction of overall readiness to
include weapons sustainment.
The last subcommittee modification would be to the
Subcommittee on Intelligence, Emerging Threats and
Capabilities, which was formerly known as the Subcommittee on
Emerging Threats and Capabilities. The jurisdiction of the
subcommittee remains relatively unchanged, except for the
addition of intelligence policy, including coordination of
military intelligence programs, national intelligence programs,
excluding the national intelligence space programs, and DOD
[Department of Defense] elements that are part of the
intelligence community.
At this time, is there any discussion, or are there any
questions concerning the committee rules?
If there is no further discussion, are there any amendments
to the committee rules?
If there are no amendments, the chair now recognizes the
gentleman from Texas, Mr. Thornberry, for the purpose of
offering a motion regarding Committee Resolution No. 1, the
committee rules.
Mr. Thornberry. Mr. Chairman, I move to adopt Committee
Resolution No. 1, concerning the committee rules.
The Chairman. The question now occurs on the motion of the
gentlemen from Texas, Mr. Thornberry.
So many as are in favor will say aye.
Those opposed, no.
A quorum being present, the motion is agreed to and without
objection, a motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.
The next order of business is Committee Resolution No. 2
regarding the committee's oversight plan for the 113th
Congress. I call up Committee Resolution No. 2.
The clerk shall read the resolution.
Mr. Zakheim. Committee Resolution No. 2. Resolved, that the
Committee on Armed Services, U.S. House of Representatives,
adopt the committee oversight plan for the 113th Congress, a
copy of which is before each Member.

Under the final order of business, I call up Committee
Resolution No. 4, appointing committee staff for the 113th
Congress.
The clerk shall read the resolution.
Mr. Zakheim. Committee Resolution No. 4. Resolved, that the
persons listed on the sheet before the Members, and such other
personnel as may be required by the committee within the limits
and terms authorized under the Rules of the House of
Representatives, are hereby appointed to the staff of the
Committee on Armed Services, U.S. House of Representatives, for
the 113th Congress, it being understood that according to the
provisions of law, the chairman will fix the basic salary per
annum.

The Chairman. As many of you know, our committee is
unique in that the committee staff is integrated without
distinction between majority and minority staffs. They are here
to provide advice and counsel to all of you, Republican and
Democratic Members alike.
You know, I don't know whether Doug was a Republican or a
Democrat. Yeah, I don't know if he knew what he was. He was
interested in our defense.
Please feel free to avail yourself of their services. They
are a talented group of professionals.
A copy of the committee staff for the 113th Congress was
originally provided to Members' offices on Friday, January
13th. The Members should all have--excuse me, January 11th. The
Members should all have before them an updated version, which
has been prepared in consultation with the minority, because of
the passing of Doug.
Following consultation with Mr. Smith, I ask unanimous
consent that the resolution be considered as read.
Is there objection?
Without objection, it is so ordered.
At this time, is there any discussion, or are there any
questions concerning the committee staff?
If there is no further discussion, the chair now recognizes
the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Thornberry, for the purpose of
offering a motion regarding Committee Resolution No. 4,
appointing the committee staff for the 113th Congress.
Mr. Thornberry. Mr. Chairman, I move to adopt Committee
Resolution No. 4, regarding committee staffing for the 113th
Congress.
The Chairman. The question now occurs on the motion of the
gentleman from Texas, Mr. Thornberry.
So many as are in favor will say aye.
Those opposed, no.
A quorum being present, the motion is agreed to, and
without objection, a motion to reconsider is laid upon the
table.
Without objection, committee staff is authorized to make
technical and conforming changes to reflect the actions of the
committee in adopting Committee Resolutions Nos. 1 through 4.
Before we adjourn, let me raise a few administrative
matters. As chairman, I plan to strictly enforce the 5-minute
rule for the questioning of witnesses. Once your time is up, I
will call the time. I would also like to remind Members that
the full committee will hold a classified Members only briefing
on Afghanistan and Pakistan operations and intelligence next
Tuesday, January 22nd, at 10:00 o'clock in this room.
Additionally, the full committee will hold a hearing at 10:00
a.m. on Wednesday, January 23rd, on the review of sexual
misconduct by basic training instructors at Lackland Air Force
Base. Both of these are very important hearings, and I would
encourage you all to be here.
Let me recognize Mr. Smith for his closing comments.
Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't really have
anything to add, except to say thank you, and now let's get to
work.
The Chairman. Thank you very much.
In the interest of brevity, if there is no further
business, the committee stands adjourned subject to the call of
the chair. Thank you all very much.
[Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]
