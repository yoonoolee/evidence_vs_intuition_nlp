----------

THURSDAY, APRIL 7, 2022

House of Representatives,
Committee on House Administration,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 9:05 a.m., in Room
1310, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Zoe Lofgren
[Chairperson of the Committee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Lofgren, Butterfield, Aguilar,
Scanlon, Davis, Loudermilk, and Steil.
Staff Present: Jamie Fleet, Democratic Staff Director;
Khalil Abboud, Deputy Democratic Staff Director; Caleb Hays,
Minority General Counsel and Deputy Staff Director; Dan Taylor,
Senior Counsel; Kulani Jalata, Elections Counsel; Sean Jones,
Professional Staff Member; Andrew Garcia, Staff Assistant; Tim
Monahan, Minority Staff Director; Elliot Smith, Minority
Professional Staff Member; Kyle Parker, Chief of Staff for
Representative Butterfield; and Elizabeth Arevalo, Legislative
Director for Representative Leger Fernandez.
The Chairperson. A quorum being present, the Committee will
come to order.
I want to note that we are holding this markup in
compliance with House Resolution 8 and the rules governing
Remote Committee Proceedings. We will count down--five, four,
three, two, one--for the tech people to begin this hearing.
The Committee will come to order.
Pursuant to the Committee on House Administration Rule 4
and House Rule XI, Clause 2, the chair announces that she may
postpone further proceedings today on the question of approving
any measure or matter or adopting an amendment on which a
recorded vote of the yeas or nays are ordered.
And, without objection, the chair is authorized to declare
a recess at any time.
I will now recognize myself for the purpose of making an
opening statement.
Today, the Committee is considering a supplemental
committee funding resolution for the second session of the
117th Congress.
Typically, this Committee reports an expense resolution
during the first session that covers both sessions. We did just
that when we reported and the House adopted House Resolution
316.
Sometimes, however, adjustments to funding levels are made
by appropriations bills, and House Rules compel House
Administration to report a revised expense resolution adjusting
the figures previously authorized in the primary expense
resolution.
The increase in funding we report today will further help
the House committees execute their constitutional duties of
exercising oversight and crafting legislation for the remainder
of the 117th Congress.
Traditionally, committee funding has been a mostly
bipartisan endeavor. I am proud to have worked with the ranking
member in this and previous Congresses to streamline the
process and make it more efficient for our busy chairs and
ranking members. I look forward to continuing that partnership
today.
I recognize the Ranking Member for any comments he may
have.
Mr. Davis. Thank you, Madam Chairperson. Well, great. I am
excited to be here to examine stock trading reforms for
Congress, but, first, I am excited to say I support this
resolution, which will get additional resources to our
committees.
I will mention, it is unfortunate that committees will not
be receiving the same level of increases that Member offices
receive, in part because of the out-of-control spending by the
January 6th partisan Select Committee.
I yield back.
The Chairperson. The gentleman yields back. I thank the
Ranking Member.
And, without objection, any additional opening statements
by Members will be made a part of the record.
I now call up House Resolution 1035 for the purposes of the
markup.
The clerk will report the resolution.
The Clerk. House Resolution 1035, Adjusting the amount
provided----
The Chairperson. Without objection, the first reading of
the resolution is dispensed with. And, without objection, the
resolution shall be considered as read and open to amendment at
any time.
[The resolution follows:]
[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

The Chairperson. Does any Member seek recognition for the
purposes of offering an amendment?
If not, the question is now on reporting House Resolution
1035 favorably to the House. The question is on the motion to
report.
All those in favor will say aye.
Opposed will say no.
In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it, and the
motion is agreed to.
Pursuant to House Rule XI, Clause 2, all Members of the
Committee have the right to file with the clerk supplemental,
additional, minority, and dissenting views.
[The information follows:]

The Chairperson. And, without objection, staff is
authorized to make technical or conforming changes.
And, with no further business before the Committee and
without objection, the Committee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 9:09 a.m., the Committee proceeded to other
business.]
