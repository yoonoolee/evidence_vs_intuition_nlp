MEMBER DAY

----------

House of Representatives,
Committee on Armed Services,
Washington, DC, Thursday, April 28, 2022.
The committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:01 a.m., in room
2118, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Adam Smith (chairman
of the committee) presiding.
The Chairman. Call the meeting to order. Good morning.
Today we meet to hear from Members of the House, not
members of the committee, on their interests in the National
Defense Authorization Act that we are putting together. I look
forward to those comments. I don't have any opening statements.
Mr. Rogers, do you have anything?
Mr. Rogers. No, I just look forward to hearing from our
colleagues and what they want us to be helpful with. Thank you.
The Chairman. Absolutely. And I believe Mr. Arrington is up
first. Mr. Arrington, you are recognized.

STATEMENT OF HON. JODEY C. ARRINGTON, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM
TEXAS

Mr. Arrington. Chairman, thank you so much, and Ranking
Member and committee members, for the opportunity to provide
input. This is a great process. I don't know any committee that
runs a regular order or a healthy congressional legislative
appropriations process than your committee. And it has played
out well with the partnership with Air Force and the experts on
your committee and the ground, the information we get on the
ground in my community in West Texas and the largest B-1 bomber
base in the country at Dyess Air Force Base.
So I think you have got 61 years running now where you guys
get an NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act] done. God
Bless America, I mean, seriously. In this institution, you guys
are still, you know, giving Americans and Members of Congress
hope because of your constructive, bipartisan work. So, you
know, if I don't say anything else, please hear that. That is
the sentiment I know of my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle.
Now, with respect to, you know, my parochial interest and,
but I think these are aligned very much so with the interest of
our country and with respect to the Air Force's 7th Bomb Wing
and the 317th Airlift, which is there in Abilene, Texas. We
call it the Big Country. And we are proud to host our airmen
out there and have done some really great things together with
you and your team over the years identifying the challenges and
opportunities to keep our air arsenal just as strong and
effective as possible.
I was very pleased. It was a competitive process. I wish I
could take credit for it. But the Air Force selected Dyess to
be one of the bases for the next-generation bomber, the B-21. I
know everybody is thrilled about that and looking forward to
having that most capable and most lethal bomber in the world
flying again out of the Big Country.
The challenge has been we have had 62 B-1 bombers. And
these guys can be anywhere in the world in 24 hours projecting
American strength, hit any target anywhere in 24 hours. So,
suffice it to say, it is integral to our air arsenal, to our
prevention, deterrence, and intervention when needed.
But recently the Air Force has retired 17 of these planes.
And so we have gone from 62 to 45. But there are only 36 combat
coded. So I think we are in a bit of a vulnerable spot. And so
I have worked with your team and with the Air Force to make
sure that the birds that we have left in the transition to the
B-21 are the most lethal and capable they can possibly be. And
that is with respect to expanded carry and with hypersonic
weapons. And, again, your folks have been great to work with.
These are the things we have done leading up to this next
year's NDAA. But we have just got to be vigilant so that this
is the most seamless process and there is no disruption to our
readiness as we see the world quickly evolving in terms of the
threats to our country and our interest. And you guys know that
better than I do.
So, by the way, no community has won the Barksdale Trophy
for the most supportive community for bomber bases more than
Abilene. And I just want to brag on them because their
reputation preceded me. And if I have been effective in any
regard over the last 6 years working with you all, I think it
is in large part because of the good work that they have done
and the relationships they have had with the Air Force.
The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired. If you have
something you wanted to get wrapped up----
Mr. Arrington. Other than just bragging, you know, you get
a Texan and a microphone talking about his people, sir----
The Chairman. I can appreciate that.
Mr. Arrington. You know what? I think I have pretty much
hit it. But let me just summarize in one statement. We need to
continue to develop the B-21 and get it ready for showtime in
the next several years. So keep investing in the R&D [research
and development] there. And if we can expedite the onlining and
operationalizing of the B-21, let's do it. And then let's
continue to make the remaining B-1s as lethal as possible.
Those are our priorities. That is our focus.
Thank you all so much for your leadership.
The Chairman. Thank you. I appreciate it.
Mr. Arrington. Thanks for indulgence, too.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Arrington can be found in
the Appendix on page 19.]
The Chairman. Go ahead, Mr. Case. Yes.
Mr. Case. My mic, is my mic working?
The Chairman. It is working, yeah.
Mr. Case. Okay. Now it is.

STATEMENT OF HON. ED CASE, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM HAWAII

Mr. Case. Chair, Ranking Member, and members of the
committee, aloha. Thank you very much for the opportunity to
focus on national security challenges and opportunities that
face us in my part of the world, the Indo-Pacific, and Hawaii's
continued critical role.
Today I would like to touch briefly on three specific
issues: the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, Pacific
Deterrence Initiative, and our public shipyards, including
Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard.
First, I am so grateful to this committee for your prompt
and full efforts to address the Red Hill crisis to date. These
have been critical to taking care of our service members and
the residents of Honolulu. But we know that the Red Hill crisis
is more than just fixing old and dilapidated infrastructure. It
is about force readiness in the Indo-Pacific and about public
confidence in support of our military back home.
This crisis has forced us to rethink logistics and bulk
fuel storage distribution in this critical region. These
changes, which will need to be implemented over several years,
will be instrumental in meeting the challenges in the Indo-
Pacific. To this end, I ask this committee to fully support the
President's additional $1 billion FY2023 [fiscal year 2023]
budget for Red Hill and take all other action to provide
effective oversight and direction of the Red Hill remediation,
defueling, and closure initiative of the Department of Defense.
Second, a critical component of our military's efforts in
the Indo-Pacific is the 2-year-old-now Pacific Deterrence
Initiative. PDI continues to evolve and mature as a cohesive
series of investments that strengthen our presence throughout
the region. This year the administration submitted a budget of
$6 billion for PDI, which is a welcome and necessary further
increase from last year's level set by this committee. We also
see an increase in military construction and improvements in
critical logistics nodes throughout the region.
During my recent delegation visit to the Pacific, a
recurring theme from our friends and allies is the need for
more U.S. presence. We just want you to show up more. These
investments underscore our commitment to them and are critical
to our efforts.
Third, underpinning all of our efforts in the vast and
maritime Indo-Pacific are our public shipyards. Without the
physical and human capacity of our shipyards, we cannot project
the force that is necessary to deter and address today's
threats. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, as with our Nation's
other three shipyards, is a part of the fabric of our Hawaiian
community. Unfortunately, these shipyards have become aged and
increasingly ill-prepared for the challenges of the 21st
century. We simply must reinvest in these facilities and our
world-class shipyard workers.
The Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan, or SIOP, is
our commitment to improve and recapitalize these facilities. It
is critical that we continue to support the multiyear $21
billion effort that we have undertaken. SIOP is multifaceted,
and the plan will recapitalize our dry docks, reconfigure
infrastructure, and modernize the equipment necessary for a
more agile and efficient workforce. Without these improvements,
we will see delays in the timely return of ships and submarines
to their mission.
In closing, I encourage the committee to continue to
authorize the commitments that address our modern-day
challenges in the Indo-Pacific. These promises reaffirm our
obligation to our service members and their families, the
workers that keep our shipyards running, and finally, to our
friends and allies that rely on us to be the bulwark of
democracy in this critical region.
Thank you very much. And I appreciate your consideration.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Case can be found in the
Appendix on page 21.]
The Chairman. Thank you. And I should have said this. Mr.
Arrington, do you have any questions? I don't. Okay. Good.
Thank you.
Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson of Ohio. Is the microphone working? Thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Rogers, and distinguished
members of the House Armed Services Committee, thank you----
The Chairman. Actually, I lied. I don't think it is
working. Can you hit the button one more time?
Mr. Johnson of Ohio. I did. I pressed it----
The Chairman. No, just one time.
Mr. Johnson of Ohio. One time.
The Chairman. Okay. Sorry. One time. And talk.
Mr. Johnson of Ohio. How about now?
The Chairman. [Inaudible.]
Mr. Johnson of Ohio. Now we're on. Okay. That is what
happens when you wear hearing aids. You can't tell which end of
the sound spectrum you are on.

STATEMENT OF HON. BILL JOHNSON, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM OHIO

Mr. Johnson of Ohio. Thanks, Chairman Smith and Ranking
Member Rogers, for allowing me to testify this morning on my
top priority for the fiscal year 2023 National Defense
Authorization Act.
And I would like to do it this way. I would like you to
imagine for a moment that you are the parent of a son or
daughter who died while serving our great country. The anguish
of losing a family member, let alone a child, is indescribable.
I know that from personal experience.
And now I would like you to imagine how it would feel
should the personal effects, the last remaining possessions of
your deceased child, are inexplicably lost forever. We are
still--you are then told that you are on your own, that you,
the family, must file a claim with a third-party vendor who was
contracted by your deceased child's branch of service to
deliver your child's personal effects to you and hope for the
best.
This is a true story of what actually happened to my
constituents, the Ward family, when their son, Specialist
Christian Ward, died in an accident while stationed at Fort
Carson, Colorado. The contractor hired by the Army did not
delivery many of Christian's belongings to the family. And
rather than the Army accepting responsibility for the lost
items, the Ward family was told by the Army that it was the
family's responsibility to file a claim and work with the
third-party contractor.
As a retired Air Force officer who served nearly 27 years
in uniform, this is not how our Armed Forces should be treating
grieving families whose son or daughter died while protecting
our freedoms. I was a commander in the Air Force. And if I had
been Specialist Ward's commander, you can better believe I
would have been raising hell with somebody. You can delegate
responsibility, but you can't delegate accountability. And we
can do better. We must do better.
I introduced H.R. 3363, the Specialist Christian Ward Act,
to ensure that no other grieving military family experiences
the unnecessary pain the Ward family did. The legislation is
rather simple. It states that in the event such personal
property of a deceased military member is lost, damaged, or
destroyed, the Secretary of that service is permitted to
reimburse the family or designated recipient for the fair
market value of the property and also permits the Secretary to
pursue a claim against the third-party contractor. This ensures
that DOD [Department of Defense] is responsible for working
with the third-party contractor rather than placing this
tremendous burden upon the grieving family when they have so
many other pressing concerns during a time of intense crisis.
This legislation was actually included in the House-passed
version of the FY22 NDAA. And I respectfully ask that it be
included in the FY23 NDAA. I am grateful to my friend and Ohio
colleague, Congressman Mike Turner, for offering an amended
version of the Specialist Christian Ward Act during the
committee markup last September. The amendment was accepted by
voice vote as part of an en bloc and was included in the base
text of the House-passed bill, H.R. 4350.
Unfortunately, I learned last December after the negotiated
conference report was released that the language was stripped
out of the final version of the NDAA. I have been told that the
Senate removed the language due to concerns expressed by DOD.
What the Department's exact concerns were I don't know. They
haven't responded to my questions seeking clarification. But I
do know this. It is Congress, not the Department of Defense,
that legislates. And I strongly believe we must hold DOD
accountable for contractors whom they hire, particularly when
it involves the handling of personal effects from deceased
service members.
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify. It is my
hope to work with you to fix what may seem like a small issue
to some, the filing of a claim, but one that has significant
impact for our military families. The Ward family knows they
will never likely receive Christian's belongings that were lost
in transport. But they have made it their mission to ensure
other grieving families never go through this awful and
unnecessary experience.
I respectfully urge you to again include the amended text
of the Specialist Christian Ward Act in the FY23 NDAA.
And with that, I yield back.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Johnson of Ohio can be found
in the Appendix on page 23.]
The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. That is very well
said and a very important issue. We will take another run at it
this year. And we will be in touch with you to make sure we
understand what the concerns are on the Senate side.
Mr. Johnson of Ohio. Okay. Yeah, I have asked the
Department of Defense. And they have not responded. I asked
Secretary Austin what the issues were so we could fix it. But
they haven't responded.
The Chairman. Understood. We will get to the bottom of it.
Thank you.
Mr. Johnson of Ohio. Thank you.
The Chairman. I think we have some people who are supposed
to be online. Are they online? Okay. I have to read one quick
thing here anyway. I did not do this at the start to make
sure--well.
I ask for unanimous consent that all Members' written
statements will be made part of the record. The committee has
received statements for the record, in addition to our
colleagues who are appearing remotely or here in person.
Without objection, so ordered.
That's all I needed to do, right? Okay. My opening
statement that I neglected to read in the opening. So now we
are good. A couple of members are allegedly in route, so we
will give them a minute.
[Pause.]
The Chairman. Thank you. We are back in session.
And, Mr. Bilirakis, you are first up. You are recognized.
Go ahead.

STATEMENT OF HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM
FLORIDA

Mr. Bilirakis. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you very much. Again, I want to thank you and the Ranking
Member Rogers for providing me with the opportunity to testify
on one of my longstanding commitments towards our Nation's
veterans, rectifying the unfair offset between military retired
pay and VA [Veteran Affairs] disability compensation, known as
concurrent receipt. I am sure you are familiar with it.
Specifically, I am advocating for the inclusion of my bill
H.R. 1282, the Major Richard Star Act, into the FY23 NDAA. My
bipartisan and bicameral bill with the support of
cosponsorship, original cosponsorship of Dr. Ruiz, would expand
eligibility to certain military retirees for concurrent receipt
of veterans' disability compensation and retired pay or combat-
related special compensation.
In the past, military service members, as you know, found,
have endured, of course, they have endured this disability, and
it is service connected. They could not collect their pension
and their disability pay in unison. To receive VA disability
compensation, veterans had to forfeit their retirement benefits
and pay back dollar for dollar the amount that would have been
owed to them if they had received both benefits.
In the fiscal year 2004, the National Defense Authorization
Act, Congress created the Concurrent Retirement and Disability
Pay [CRDP] program. In doing so, veterans who are 100 percent
disabled were authorized to receive both earned benefits, known
as concurrent receipt, for the first time ever. Since then, the
law has expanded the eligibility to receive military retirement
pay and their VA disability pay concurrently to military
retirees with 20 or more years of service and a 50 percent or
higher disability rating. My father was responsible for that
when he was in Congress.
While this certainly marks tremendous progress, medically
retired veterans with less than 20 years of service who are
wounded in combat must still offset their DOD retirement pay by
their disability, their VA disability compensation. Many of
these veterans had the full intention of serving for 20 years
or more and gain full retirement benefits but through no fault
of their own were unable to do so because of injury in the line
of duty.
This group of retired veterans, also known as Chapter 61
retirees, are arguably the most at risk because of their
complex combat injuries and are just as deserving, and I know
you will agree, as those who served greater than 20 years of
service.
By creating the CRDP, I firmly believe that Congress
admitted that the offset required, that was created in 2004
again, the offset required of disabled veterans was wrong.
Approximately 550,000 military retirees are eligible to receive
both military retired pay and VA disability compensation but
are prohibited under the current guidelines of this program.
Again, this applies to Chapter 61 veterans.
In my view, I see these veterans as essentially being taxed
for their service and sacrifice because they were deemed
service-connected disabled. My bill would remove that tax and
the disparity between these combat disabled veterans and the
rest of the military retiree population.
This bill and its Senate companion have received a wide
margin of bipartisan support and also bicameral support, as I
said, this Congress. As a matter of fact, we have 220
cosponsors in the House and 58 cosponsors in the Senate. It
also has the support of the VSOs [veteran service
organizations], including the American Legion, the VFW
[Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S.], DAV [Disabled American
Veterans], VVA [Vietnam Veterans of America], AMVETS [American
Veterans], Military Officers Association of America, Fleet
Reserve Organization, American Ex-Prisoners of War, and the
Association of the Navy.
So I really appreciate your consideration in this matter.
And then we did find the money as well to pay for this. So I
would appreciate your consideration. And I would like this to
be included in the NDAA.
Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Bilirakis can be found in
the Appendix on page 25.]
The Chairman. Thank you very much.
Mr. Foster.

STATEMENT OF HON. BILL FOSTER, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM ILLINOIS

Mr. Foster. Thank you. And good morning. And thank you,
Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Rogers, and members of the
committee for allowing me to testify.
I am here today to request that the committee first
authorize $20 million for research and development on low-
enriched uranium fuel for aircraft carriers and submarines, and
secondly to reverse the Wilson Amendment, which bars the U.S.
from funding the comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty
Organization's Preparatory Commission.
For decades, ending the use of weapons-grade, highly
enriched uranium [HEU] outside of nuclear weapons has been a
U.S. policy priority. Currently, the largest remaining non-
weapons use for HEU and the biggest barrier to its elimination
is its use as fuel for U.S. naval propulsion reactors. The
movement away from the use of LEU [low enriched uranium] for
non-weapons applications has only accelerated in recent years.
All advanced reactors under development use low-enriched
uranium, since the security cost of HEU makes its use in
commercial advanced reactors a non-starter.
NASA recently forswore the use of high-enriched uranium in
all of its propulsion and its surface power reactors for
precisely the same reasons that the U.S. Navy should--that the
marginal performance improvement from the use of HEU does not
justify the vast increase in proliferation risk and security
costs. So the U.S. Navy stands virtually alone in the world in
using weapons-grade HEU for non-weapons applications.
And if we continue to use weapons-grade HEU for propulsion
reactors, then all of the weapons-interested countries of the
world, from Iran to South Korea, have an excuse to copy us and
accumulate large inventories of weapons-usable high-enriched
uranium, as is their right unfortunately under the current
protocols of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
As the only Ph.D. physicist in Congress, I believe it is
crucial that we continue research and development to optimize
the transition of these reactors to LEU fuel. So, as the
committee has done in previous NDAAs, I urge you to include $20
million to continue this R&D [research and development] on LEU
fuel.
Secondly, I would like to draw your attention to another
pressing issue, the restriction of funding to the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty [CTBT] Organization's Preparatory
Commission under the Wilson Amendment. This commission is
tasked with monitoring nations' compliance with a comprehensive
ban on nuclear explosive testing. Without the U.S.'s
inspectors, countries like Russia, China, Iran, who are focused
on undermining the CTBT's inspection regime, are filling the
void. The quality of the inspections has undoubtedly fallen.
Not only that, the Wilson Amendment makes it harder for our
country to eventually ratify or even decide to adhere to the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
This year we have the opportunity to reverse this provision
and to take concrete action to curb the global proliferation of
nuclear weapons and secure the safety of future generations.
Short of ratification, U.S. support for the CTBT Preparatory
Commission remains essential.
I urge you, your strong consideration of my two requests.
Thank you.
And I yield back.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Foster can be found in the
Appendix on page 27.]
The Chairman. Thank you.
Mr. Carter.
Mr. Carter. Well, I am having trouble here. Is it on?
The Chairman. There you go. Don't worry about the light.
Mr. Carter. The light doesn't mean anything?
The Chairman. Yeah, well, most people can't seem to see it.
So you hit the button once. If it doesn't work, if you hit the
button again, it will work. So----
Mr. Carter. Wow. How simple.
The Chairman. Go ahead. Sorry.

STATEMENT OF HON. EARL L. ``BUDDY'' CARTER, A REPRESENTATIVE
FROM GEORGIA

Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member
Rogers. I appreciate the opportunity to be here for you. And
good morning to you.
Gentlemen, I have the honor and privilege of representing
the First Congressional District of Georgia, which encompasses
all four military installations in our country. And we have
Moody Air Force Base. We have Kings Bay Naval Base. We have
Hunter Army Airfield. We have Fort Stewart. All of those within
the First Congressional District.
So it is no mistake that great installations such as these
were placed along the 110 pristine miles of coastline in
southeast Georgia. Our proximity to the Port of Savannah, the
Port of Brunswick, and warm climate were important to our
military leaders when they chose the First Congressional
District.
In addition, our community is also home to Combat Readiness
Training Center at the Air Dominance Center in Savannah.
However, it may not be home to this critical CRTC for much
longer if the President's budget prevails. Keep in mind that it
is only one of four, only four in the Nation, and this is one
of them right here.
Unfortunately, the President's fiscal year 2023 budget
provides no funding in military personnel and operations and
maintenance for the CRTC in Savannah. Consequently, the Air
National Guard intends to soon close the Savannah CRTC citing
budget concerns. I remind you, here we are potentially on the
brink of World War III, and we are talking, this administration
is talking about potentially closing a Combat Readiness
Training Center. It is the most ludicrous thing I have ever
heard of in my life.
Now, with Russia's military aggression in Europe and
China's increased engagement in Asia and the Pacific
threatening our allies and partners, we cannot compromise our
military's combat readiness. The Savannah CRTC is the most
heavily utilized, unique, and cost efficient training facility
in the Air Force. It offers unparalleled opportunities for
peer-to-peer air combat training, regional training
conferences, classified engagements, and support for regional
operations.
Most notably, the Savannah CRTC is one of the very few
locations in the United States that features an accredited
6,000-square-foot Special Access Program Facility to support
our Nation's cutting-edge fifth-generation fighter aircraft,
the F-35 and the F-22. And, oh, by the way, every F-22 pilot
that has been trained in the last 2 years has been trained at
this CRTC.
The Savannah CRTC is already a site with considerable
Federal investment. Just a few years ago Congress at the
request of the National Guard Bureau chose to invest $25
million in military construction funding for a hangar to
support fifth-generation fighter maintenance. The project is
already well underway and is scheduled for completion in August
of this year. Again, a $25 million hangar that is to be
completed in August. I have been invited to the ribbon cutting
to be held in September. It is slated to be closed in April of
2023.
Closing the CRTC would pointedly undercut the usefulness of
this investment. This is exactly the type of waste that
frustrates taxpayers. We need the Savannah Air Dominance
Center's CRTC now more than ever. And we cannot treat $25
million in investments like it is pocket change.
I am calling on President Biden to invest in our combat
readiness and keep this center open so that our world-class
military service members have the world-class training they
deserve. Furthermore, I would ask the committee to add $5
million for operations and maintenance of the Air National
Guard to support training and options, and operations of
Savannah CRTC in your fiscal 2023 NDAA. In addition, $6.5
million is needed in support of the Air Force National Guard
personnel who support these who are assigned to the CRTC in
Savannah.
As Members of Congress, I know we recognize that budgets
have limits and hard decisions must be made to protect our
country's bottom line. But our military's capacity to conduct
realistic live training sets us apart from our adversaries. And
there is no better example than right here. We can see from
Russia's tactical incompetency in Ukraine just how disastrous
it can be if a nation does not properly prepare----
The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired----
Mr. Carter. I think I've made my point. I hope I have, Mr.
Chairman.
The Chairman. I believe that you have, yeah.
Mr. Carter. And I thank you for that.
The Chairman. Yeah.
Mr. Carter. This is ludicrous.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Carter can be found in the
Appendix on page 29.]
The Chairman. Thank you.
Questions, Mr. Rogers, anything?
Mr. Rogers. No. I would just make the point that I make to
people all the time. I don't care if it is a Democrat President
or a Republican President. They propose budgets. We write
budgets. So don't let it get you too riled up.
The Chairman. It is but the start of a long process.
Mr. Carter. And as a member of the budget committee, I keep
that in mind.
Mr. Rogers. Yes.
The Chairman. Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate
it.
Do we have anybody on? Okay. Is Ms. Tenney with us? Let me
just say you have a lovely set of cabinets there, the flags and
the books and the knickknacks. Very well put together. We do
need you, however, at some point. All right. So we don't have
Ms. Tenney.
So we will go with Mr. San Nicolas, who is here the old-
fashioned way, in person. Mr. San Nicolas, you are recognized.
Sorry. I should put a little memo up. Don't worry about
what color the light is. Push the button, talk. Go ahead.
Mr. San Nicolas. I am going to assume that--there we are.
The Chairman. It is working. Go ahead.

STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS, A DELEGATE FROM
GUAM

Mr. San Nicolas. Hafa Adai, Chairman Smith, Ranking Member
Rogers, and members of the distinguished House Armed Services
Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on our
priorities for Guam in the development of the chairman's mark
for the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year
2023.
I would like to just take a brief privilege, Mr. Chairman,
to recognize my two children, Kaleb and Katelyn, who are here
with me today. Today is Take Your Kid to Work Day for their
school. And so they are here to observe Daddy working for the
people of Guam.
I would also like to point out, Mr. Chairman, that my son
has autism. And the first item I am going to speak to that I am
hoping we can address in the NDAA speaks to that particular
demographic, that is severely impacted in the territories and
is underscored by a recent Supreme Court decision and is
something that I believe this committee can address in the
context of how I am going to share it.
As China and North Korea proceed to push their political
and military power throughout the region and as Russian
aggression has illustrated the need to remain globally
vigilant, now more than ever we must support the resiliency of
American families throughout our Republic whose sons and
daughters swell our ranks in defense of freedom.
Specific to our territories, it is well known on this
committee that our military recruitment per capita proudly
exceeds national averages. And to further support this, I
respectfully request the committee to include in this year's
NDAA necessary amendment language to strike the provisions that
prevent Supplemental Security Income from applying to American
families in territories.
A standard lifeline throughout our Nation, SSI provides
support that is critical for us to maximally recruit into our
armed services. If a family is able to avail of SSI, Mr.
Chairman, that means that the family members who typically
would have to stay home to take care of those dependent family
members would then have the resources to be able to answer the
call to serve our country.
Enabling SSI in our territories will significantly bolster
the family and recruitment environment of some of our highest
per capita military service areas in the country. On a cost
basis with a recent CBO [Congressional Budget Office] scoring,
SSI initiatives for territories in the 117th Congress at a
price point of just $33 million per annum, it represents a
fractional cost of service member recruitment and retention and
a 0.004295 percent of the total prior year 2022 NDAA at $768.2
billion.
I really hope, Mr. Chairman, that we can give this serious
consideration. I believe that this is an opportune time for us
to address this inequity. In our research and in our office as
we have looked back on the applicability of SSI to the children
of service members, extraordinary effort has been made in 1993
and 2004 to make it available to service member children, but
again, territorial children are fully excluded. And if we are
going to be creating a maximal recruitment environment in our
own territories that on a per capita basis have put out more
recruits per capita than anywhere else in this country, it is
only right for us to come full circle.
On the readiness front, as we further harden Guam with
necessary missile defense assets to complement our force
projection on the second island chain, attention to Guam
defense access roads is needed to ensure that critical access
points are traversable by the necessary vehicles and equipment
needed to support the planned 360-degree defense system.
And with that, Mr. Chairman, without objections, I would
like to enter into the record a letter from Rear Admiral
Nicholson, who is a commander of Naval Forces Marianas on Guam,
without objections.
The Chairman. Sorry. I had to get to my button there.
Without objection, so ordered.
[The information referred to can be found in the Appendix
on page 34.]
Mr. San Nicolas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
According to Rear Admiral Nicholson's letter, increased
exercises and new capabilities in Guam will undoubtedly
increase military traffic on the Guam road system. In light of
these increased traffic and associated road infrastructure
requirements, we request the committee initiate a study of
defense access road needs on Guam, as they correspond to the
aforementioned MSR [military supply route] use, as well as the
planned 360-degree air and missile defense system for Guam to
ensure that all possible DARs [defense access roads] are funded
to meet military needs assuming worst-case scenarios.
And with that, Mr. Chairman, my time has expired.
[The prepared statement of Mr. San Nicolas can be found in
the Appendix on page 32.]
The Chairman. Thank you very much. I appreciate your being
here. It is great to be able to have your children here with
you as well. So, appreciate your testimony.
Question? No. Okay.
With that, Ms. Tenney I see is on the Webex. And you are
recognized. Go ahead.

STATEMENT OF HON. CLAUDIA TENNEY, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM NEW
YORK

Ms. Tenney. Thank you, Chairman Smith and also to Ranking
Member Rogers and the distinguished members of the House Armed
Services Committee, for providing Members the opportunity to
share our priorities with you today.
I am so honored to represent New York's 22nd Congressional
District, which stretches from the shores of Lake Ontario in
the north to the Pennsylvania border in the south. The region
has a strong heritage as a birthplace of innovation. The Erie
Canal was started here. It is where IBM was founded. And today
it is the headquarters for the Air Force Research Lab
Information Directorate, which we all call Rome Lab.
My congressional district is home to 96 percent of Rome
Lab's workforce, which employs 830 military and civilian
personnel and is responsible for over 1,415 indirect jobs
across the region. In addition, with a local impact, a local
economic impact of more than $500 million, Rome Lab is vitally
important in driving economic growth and high-tech innovation
in my community.
But just as important as Rome Lab's local impact is its
impact nationally, which is unrivaled. It remains among our
Nation's top defense innovators. My requests this year on its
behalf reflect investments that are needed to ensure our Nation
continues to out-innovate and out-compete our adversaries and
provide for our common defense well into the 21st century.
History has proven that every dollar we invest in Rome Lab pays
dividends well into the future, both in terms of the increased
prosperity to our communities that I represent and to the
unprecedented advancements in our national defense
capabilities.
I therefore ask for your full support of three critical
requests for the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, all
of which would greatly expand Rome Lab's capabilities and in
turn enable the United States to compete globally with our
adversaries, dominate the virtual battlespace, and counter
emerging threats to our country.
The top request for NDAA is authorization for $10 million
to develop the first and only government-owned UAS [Unmanned
Aircraft System] Traffic Management System. This investment
would be a true game changer leading to the development of
revolutionary tools to counter low-cost small unmanned aircraft
system that our adversaries use to target Americans, exploit
air space, obscure their activities, and commit acts that
disrupt our Nation's economy and our homeland.
The second request on behalf of Rome Lab is authorization
language of $10 million for the Quantum Cloud Computing and
Multi-Modality Network Testbed. It is a national security
imperative that we continue to lead in the development of
quantum computing technologies, especially given advances that
continue to be made by adversaries like China. Last year this
committee recognized the importance of investments in quantum
technologies. And FY22 NDAA provided Rome Lab with an increase
of $10 million for its quantum network testbed, as well as an
additional $10 million funding increase for its research into
the ion trap quantum computing. In FY2023, we ask that you
continue to build on this forward progress by investing in the
Quantum Cloud Computing and Multi-Modality Network Testbed.
My final request on behalf of Rome Lab is authorization
language of $10 million for the development of the Artificial
Intelligence and Machine Learning for Joint All-Domain Command
and Control Future Flag Testbed. This effort builds on the 2021
NDAA Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Center of
Excellence's four pillars--data, people, algorithms, and
infrastructure--while adding a fifth pillar of capability. AI
is a proven and rapidly advancing capability that has the
potential to impact every aspect of the Pentagon's mission.
I thank you all again for the opportunity to share my
priorities with you on behalf of the dedicated men and women of
Rome Lab, whom I am honored to represent in Congress. I can
assure you that these investments will deepen our military's
expertise in cutting-edge fields and are essential for
strengthening our Nation's defense capabilities.
Thank you so much.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Tenney can be found in the
Appendix on page 36.]
The Chairman. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. I
believe those are all the witnesses that we have to testify
today. So we appreciate the input from the Members. And we look
forward to working with them as we put together the bill going
forward. We do plan to mark up June 22nd in committee, get it
off the floor in July. So that is our timeline. And we will
look forward to working with all of you as we go forward.
With that, we are adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 10:48 a.m., the committee was adjourned.]
