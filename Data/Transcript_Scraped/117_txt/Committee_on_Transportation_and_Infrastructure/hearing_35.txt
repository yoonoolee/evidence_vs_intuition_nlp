SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

TO:      LMembers of Congress, Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure
FROM:  LStaff, Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure
RE:      LHearing on ``Industry and Labor Perspectives: A
Further Look at North American Supply Chain Challenges.''
_______________________________________________________________________

PURPOSE

The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will
hold a hearing on Wednesday, November 17, 2021, at 10:30 a.m.
EST to examine North American supply chain challenges. The
hearing will take place in 2167 Rayburn House Office Building
and via Zoom. The Committee will hear testimony from the
following representatives of the transportation industry and
its workforce: Mario Cordero of the Port of Long Beach on
behalf of the American Association of Port Authorities, Chris
Spear of the American Trucking Associations, Ian Jefferies of
the Association of American Railroads, Anne Reinke of the
Transportation Intermediaries Association, David Correll of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Transportation
and Logistics, and Greg Regan of the Transportation Trades
Department, AFL-CIO.

BACKGROUND

COVID-19 AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many aspects of the
global supply chain. In response to several COVID-19 outbreaks
across factories in Asia in 2019-2020, factories shut down.\1\
Shipping companies also cut schedules, anticipating that with
reduced levels of activity due to outbreaks and quarantine,
overall demand would drop.\2\ However, shipping capacity proved
to be key as Americans increased their demands for consumer
goods in 2021.\3\ The surge in consumer goods, particularly
moving from Asia into West Coast ports by ship and through the
rest of the country via truck and rail, inundated the system.
The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have experienced
significant cargo volume increases, and have been at times
unable to process incoming shipping containers as they arrived,
resulting in cargo logjams off shore and within the port
complex. COVID-19 has exposed fragilities in transportation
networks, with disruption in one part of the supply chain
having a ripple effect across all parts of the supply chain,
from manufacturers to suppliers and distributors.\4\ What has
followed since has resulted in container and other equipment
shortages, port and rail congestion, and shipping delays. The
lack of available space onboard vessels, trains, trucks, in
distribution warehouses, and at ports has impacted industries
and frustrated consumers across the country and increased
prices on some goods and commodities.\5\

Online retail has fundamentally changed how products are
purchased and distributed. According to the U.S. Census Bureau,
e-commerce sales have grown from just over five percent of
total retail sales in the first quarter of 2012 to over 13
percent of total retail sales in the second quarter of 2021.\6\
E-commerce accounted for $791.7 billion in 2020, a 32.4%
increase from 2019.\7\ As a result of this trend, the demands
for freight movements by truck, and the need for more timely
and efficient deliveries, have grown significantly. This has
also prompted changes to supply chains and increased the focus
on first-mile and last-mile delivery of freight that impacts
both urban and rural areas.\8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cross-modal freight tonnage has recovered from the
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bureau of
Transportation Statistics (BTS) measures the amount of freight
carried by the transportation industry using an index called
the Freight Transportation Services Index (FTSI). In September
2021, the FTSI shows a seasonally-adjusted mark of 135.8 in
September 2021, which is below the all-time high of 142 in
April 2019, but significantly above the COVID-19 low of 125.3
in April 2020. The FTSI, which declined from the April 2021
level, is a good predictor of changes in the economic growth
rate. Shipments of raw materials and intermediate goods occur
before consumers and other businesses buy the products made
from them. So, freight activity is seen as an early indicator
of economic growth or decline. When more freight is being
shipped, that generally signals a future increase in economic
activity. When less freight is demanded, that points to
decreasing economic activity.\9\

MARITIME INDUSTRY OVERVIEW AND CURRENT CHALLENGES

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented shift in
consumer spending as Americans shifted spending from services
to goods, exposing gaps in the supply chain and container
processing capacity across the country and worldwide.\10\ In
response to several coronavirus outbreaks across factories in
Asia during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic,
factories shut down.\11\ Shipping companies then cut schedules,
anticipating reduced demand resulting from further COVID-19
restrictions. As a result, almost every ship and container has
been deployed into the market since Fall 2020.\12\ October 2021
saw a record-breaking total of 100 container ships sitting idle
awaiting dock availability at the Ports of LA and Long
Beach.\13\ These delays are expected to continue well into
2022.\14\

According to Maersk, the world's largest container shipping
corporation, its East (Asia)-West (North America) trade has
been the most impacted route in the market.\15\ Currently, for
every three containers that China exports to the U.S. West
Coast, only one is imported back, exacerbating the trade
imbalance.\16\ This uneven recovery has caused container
shortages where they are needed most. As a result, global
container rates jumped nearly 290 percent \17\, from an average
of $1,377 per 40-foot container in March 2020 to $9,195.41 in
November 2021.\18\ Despite these higher numbers, the price per
container has fallen since mid-October including a drop of 4.9
percent the first week of November 2021.\19\

Beyond the lack of capacity on vessels and getting
containers from the vessels into port, containers face
additional backlogs once offloaded and moved to marine
terminals. Due to the sheer number of containers and cargo
transiting through ports, marine terminals are at capacity-
limiting movement into, out of, and within the port.\20\ As
containers are stacked higher and higher, the ability to access
containers is affected further extending delays and
bottlenecks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\20\ https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/18/business/container-port-record-
backlog/index.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Port accessibility continues to be a significant issue
affecting truckers and other transporters in the supply chain.
For example, the lack of appointments due to congestion and
demand to enter terminal gates to repossess import containers
for U.S.-based exporters has severely affected how port
distribution centers are accepting containers.\21\ Containers
are filling terminals and storage locations, making it
difficult for truckers to return containers to a terminal, or
move them geographically out of a given zone.\22\ Recently,
some containers have been kept sitting idle for up to 30 days,
representing a significant opportunity cost.\23\

TRUCKING INDUSTRY OVERVIEW AND CURRENT CHALLENGES

Freight moves by truck on more than four million miles of
public roads (including 223,000 miles on the National Highway
System) and 616,000 bridges.\24\ The trucking industry is made
up by over 996,000 trucking companies and more than 3.3 million
commercial drivers.\25\

Trucks carried 10.2 billion tons of freight in 2020, and
trucking accounts for approximately 80.4 percent of all freight
tonnage by value and 72.5 percent by weight.\26\ According to
the BTS, long-haul freight truck traffic is projected to
increase ``dramatically'' on the National Highway System over
the next three decades, from 311 million miles per day in 2015
to 488 million miles per day by 2045.\27\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current supply chain challenges have amplified longstanding
issues in truck freight delivery. These include a lack of truck
parking, congestion at freight bottlenecks, and poor conditions
at intermodal connectors. The increasing cost and shortage of
equipment, such as chassis, has hindered the capacity of the
trucking industry to move freight.\30\ Port inefficiencies,
such as poor information sharing and a lack of available,
interoperable chassis, also limit how frequently and swiftly
trucks can pick up loads, contributing to delays in loading and
unloading at shipping facilities, a form of ``detention time.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detention time is time spent at shipping and receiving
facilities beyond that which is legitimately needed for loading
and unloading, as specified by contracts. Contracts between
shippers, receivers, and motor carriers generally define limits
on loading and unloading time at 2 hours.\32\ Any time beyond
that is detention time.\33\ Loading and unloading times can
vary based on the type of cargo, operations at the facility,
congestion at a facility, and other factors.\34\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excessive detention time creates both safety and financial
issues for truckers.\35\ A U.S. Department of Transportation
Inspector General study estimated that a 15-minute increase in
average dwell time--the total time spent by a truck at a
facility--increases the average expected crash rate by 6.2
percent.\36\ The same study found that detention time is
associated with reductions in annual earnings of $1.1 billion
to $1.3 billion for for-hire commercial drivers in the
truckload sector, and that detention reduces net income by
$250.6 million to $302.9 million annually for motor carriers in
that sector.\37\ There is no accurate, industry-wide data on
detention time, especially during the pandemic. The bipartisan
infrastructure framework, recently passed as the Senate
Amendment to H.R. 3684, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act, directed FMCSA to enter into a contract with the
Transportation Research Board to conduct a study on driver
compensation--one factor that will be studied is payment for
detention time.\38\

The COVID-19 crisis has renewed a focus on workforce
challenges in the trucking industry, including claims of a
truck driver shortage.
As truck freight tonnage has risen in recent decades, the
industry has faced increasing workforce challenges.\39\ For the
past several years, larger motor carriers have identified a
difficulty in attracting truck drivers, with recent American
Trucking Associations (ATA) estimates showing a shortage of
80,000 drivers, a 30% increase over pre-pandemic estimates.\40\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, 49 states and the District of Columbia allow 18
to 20 year old truck drivers to operate commercial vehicles for
intrastate commerce only and do not allow them to operate
vehicles in interstate commerce.\41\ ATA and others support
changing federal rules to allow drivers to operate in
interstate commerce at 18 years old.\42\ However, current
federal rules prohibit a driver from operating interstate until
21 years old, largely because crash data indicate that the
typical driver under the age of 21 is approximately three times
more likely to be the cause of a fatal crash.\43\ Under Section
5404 of the FAST Act, Congress authorized a pilot program for
individuals between the ages of 18 and 21 to drive commercial
vehicles across state lines, but only for those with commercial
motor vehicle training in the Armed Services. On September 4,
2020, FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
soliciting comments on a broader proposed pilot program for
drivers ages 18-21 to operate in interstate commerce. The
military pilot remains ongoing, while the agency has not taken
further action to establish a broader pilot. The recently
passed Senate amendment to H.R. 3684, the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act, directs DOT to establish, within 60
days, an apprenticeship pilot program for CDL drivers under the
age of 21.

commercial driver's licenses (CDLs) are issued each year.\46\
Most truck drivers today are paid by the mile or by the load,
not by the time it takes to make a delivery. Drivers are also
subject to hours-of-service limits, limiting the time they are
legally allowed to operate.\47\ Supply chain delays that are
outside of the control of drivers--such as congestion at ports
and excessive detention time at shipper and receiver
facilities--affect how much a driver can earn.

RAIL INDUSTRY OVERVIEW AND CURRENT CHALLENGES

In 2019, railroads carried nearly one-third of the nation's
freight.\48\ While freight rail carloads have declined over the
last twenty years, intermodal rail freight traffic has
increased over the same timeframe.\49\ Rail intermodal is the
long-haul movement of shipping containers and truck trailers by
rail, combined with a truck or water movement at one or both
ends.\50\ Class I railroads have reduced their workforce. In
2015, the Class I workforce average was 169,478 workers. By
2019 and pre-COVID, some 29,000 jobs were eliminated, a 17
percent decrease.\51\ In 2020, railroads eliminated another
20,000 jobs, a 14 percent decrease from the prior year.\52\

More than 40 percent of freight rail carloads and
intermodal units is based on international trade.\53\ Further,
this market accounts for approximately 35 percent of U.S. rail
revenue and more than a quarter of U.S. rail tonnage.\54\
During this same six-month period in 2021, the Class I railroad
workforce averaged 114,909 workers, compared to 144,346 workers
during the same six-month period in 2019. Some weeks in late
2020 and the first half of 2021, U.S. railroads were handling
more than 300,000 containers and trailers per week.\55\ To
right size the imbalance of volumes and staffing levels,
railroads have attempted to re-hire some furloughed workers and
train new employees, though according to shippers and the
Surface Transportation Board, they have been unsuccessful at
hiring or retaining an adequate workforce following the
reduction in forces described above.\56\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to suppressed workforce levels and previously
planned cuts to yard capacity, freight railroads are
encountering an imbalance between incoming and outgoing freight
that constrains terminal fluidity.\57\ Certain rail terminals
are not designed for long-term storage of significant numbers
of containers and two of the largest U.S. railroads temporarily
restricted shipments to Chicago this past summer in order to
clear space.\58\ Extreme weather events, including wildfires in
the western United States and hurricanes in the Gulf Coast have
further constrained the national railroad system in the last
year.\59\

CONCLUSION

This hearing will explore ideas, improvements, and
solutions to alleviate the current supply chain challenges. On
February 24, 2021, the Biden administration issued Executive
Order 4017, ``America's Supply Chains'' and convened a Supply
Chain Taskforce to help support and improve America's supply
chain.\60\ Similarly, the recently passed Senate Amendment to
H.R. 3684, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, includes
$27.75 billion in competitive grant programs that are eligible
to fund highway and intermodal freight improvements and port
infrastructure projects, in addition to hundreds of billions of
dollars for investments in roads, bridges, and rail. These
funds can support projects critical to maintaining, improving,
and increasing the resiliency of the nation's supply chain.\61\

Now, with that, I recognize myself for my opening
statement.
Supply chain challenges stemming from new freight shipment
patterns in a world impacted by COVID-19 continue to hamper
business and consumers. Americans are buying more items from
overseas, instead of spending money on vacations, events, and
other things regarding services.
So, no one knows whether these are temporary or permanent
changes, as we dig out from under the pandemic.
Now, some will try to blame the Biden administration for
these woes. But let's remember, nearly every part of the supply
chain is dominated by private businesses. Shipping
conglomerates, marine terminal operators, rail, trucking,
warehouse operators are non-Federal entities, ports.
And private businesses are enjoying robust profits across
the freight sector. They are responsible for their business
decisions on whether to pursue capital and labor investments
needed to accommodate freight demand. That is why I am eager to
hear from today's witnesses on what they are doing to overcome
the freight chokepoints we have been experiencing for months.
We held a hearing in the Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation Subcommittee in June on this issue, but the
freight challenges remain, and are projected to continue until
next year.
At the same time as these challenges persist, the freight
industries--ocean carriers, railroads, marine terminal
operators, trucking companies, et cetera--continue to earn
robust profits: in 2020, more than $800 billion, collectively.
So, congestion, apparently, is not bad for the bottom line,
just bad for the American consumer, in terms of availability
and price inflation.
I have served on this committee 35 years, pretty much
evenly split between the majority and the minority. During
those years, for the most part, this committee has searched for
resolution of real problems, not politically driven,
opportunistic, finger-pointing. Yes, America has a crisis in
its supply chain, delaying delivery of needed materials from
manufacturing, and driving up the cost of consumer goods. The
solutions are, for the most part, not simple, nor short term.
It will require real work, Federal investment, policy changes,
and, hopefully, bipartisan cooperation by this committee and
others of jurisdiction.
I call the problem the 3Ds: dependence, driven by Wall
Street, and decades of so-called free trade policy at the
behest of corporate profits to escape environmental laws,
regulation, labor rights, and other things.
We have become incredibly dependent upon goods and
materials and supplies from overseas.
And then, two, disinvestment. Again, driven by Wall Street
and corporate executives, oriented toward short-term profits--
think Hunter Harrison, so-called Precision Scheduled
Railroading, a disaster for shippers, but great for the bottom
line. Oh, it also impinges on safety. But otherwise, it is a
great idea. And also, disinvestment has been driven by mindless
opposition to needed critical Federal investment in our
transportation sectors.
All of the above weaken United States capability to meet
critical needs in a time of crisis. N95s, anybody?
And then three, deregulation, leading to massive mergers,
lack of real competition across many sectors of the economy,
leading to oligopolistic practices in supply and pricing. The
Federal Maritime Commission snoozed while there were massive,
foreign-dominated mergers in ocean freight. The Federal
Railroad Administration stood by as freight service and safety
deteriorated under co-called Precision Scheduled Railroading.
Since April 20th, consumer goods consumption is up. From
April 20 to now, 32 percent. That is 15 percent more than pre-
pandemic levels. Last month, we ran a $100 billion trade
deficit, $100 billion of trade deficit because of our
dependence on imports. Ocean shipping costs, up 500 percent in
12 months. The west coast is inundated with foreign imports.
Disinvestment in port infrastructure by the Federal Government,
lack of investment in our highways and bridges, congestion
caused by that, no truck parking, the list goes on and on
because of Federal neglect and the reluctance to make needed
Federal investments.
Now, we will hear a lot about the shortage of truckdrivers.
For years, I have talked about detention time. You get to the
warehouse, and they say, ``Oh, why don't you go get in that
line over there?'' Five hours later, six hours later, maybe you
have gotten unloaded, maybe you are out of duty time now. That
is your tough luck. It is no skin off their back, it doesn't
cost them anything to make you sit there. In the old days, it
did. If they made you sit for hours on end, they had to pay
you. But right now, this is what you would call an external
diseconomy; they put the cost on the truckdrivers, and I have
been trying to pursue this issue for quite some time.
We are getting some interesting statistics about this. The
DOT inspector general says that truckdrivers lost between $1
and $1.3 billion in earnings because of detention time. We will
hear from Dr. Correll, who says that in the 11 hours of driving
allowed, the average truckdriver drives 6\1/2\ hours. That is a
pretty damn inefficient system. If we could make the system
efficient, if we could put consequences on those places where
truckdrivers have to unload--and we will hear more about that
from Dr. Correll--that would solve a lot of problems.
Similarly, J.B. Hunt senior vice president of corporate
safety, security, and driver personnel, Greer Woodruff, said
the driver issue comes down relative to supply and demand. ``I
happen to believe we have plenty of drivers. We don't use them
very well.'' When asked how it could be more efficient, he said
expedite loading and unloading times, allow drop-and-hook, add
flexible appointment times and appointment times to allow for
efficient transit and rest time, work with shippers to
accommodate onsite parking, and provide consistency in loads
and lanes, all of which would squeeze more time out of a driver
and add capacity to the market.
So, the President has tried to jawbone the private sector,
and that would include labor, the ports, the marine terminal
operators, and others who are involved in this. But ultimately,
they are independent decisionmakers. He has also, just Monday,
signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, $17 billion
for long-overdue investment in our ports. And that, along with
the money that we finally freed up last year, the Harbor
Maintenance Trust Fund, will begin to deal with the issues of
access to our ports, and more throughput through our ports.
That bill also includes tens of billions of dollars in
bridges, chokepoints, highways that will, again, mitigate
congestion, and make drivers be able to work more efficiently.
Hopefully, this hearing will move beyond political partisan
talking points, and begin to identify and work on real
solutions, real long-term solutions.
[Mr. DeFazio's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Peter A. DeFazio, a Representative in
Congress from the State of Oregon, and Chair, Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure
Supply chain challenges stemming from new freight shipment patterns
in a world impacted by COVID-19 continue to hamper businesses and
consumers. Americans are buying more items from overseas instead of
spending money on vacations, events, and other experiences. And no one
knows if these changes are temporary or permanent as we dig out from
under the pandemic.
While some try to blame the Biden administration for these woes,
let's all remember the supply chain is dominated by private businesses
who are enjoying robust profits across the freight sector. They are
responsible for their business decisions on whether to pursue capital
and labor investments needed to accommodate freight demand. That's why
I am eager to hear from our witnesses today about what they are doing
to overcome the freight chokepoints we've been experiencing for months.
We held a hearing in the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation
Subcommittee in June on this issue, but the freight challenges remain
and are projected to continue into next year. At the same time as these
challenges persist, the freight industries--ocean carriers, railroads
and trucking companies--continued to earn robust profits in 2020,
earning more than $800 billion collectively. It seems like congestion
isn't terrible for big business.
Let's start this hearing by stipulating some facts:

The freight industry is trying to meet record demand for
consumer goods, particularly moving from Asia into West Coast ports by
ship and through the rest of the country via truck and rail.

Ocean shipping rates have increased by over 500 percent
since this surge in demand began last year, taking a toll on companies
and consumers.

The freight network is now inundated, and disruption in
one part of the supply chain has a ripple effect across all parts of
the chain, from manufacturers to suppliers and distributors.

Some of the current issues the supply chain is facing
have been exacerbated by ``just in time'' practices being unable to
withstand the changes in demand over the last two years.

U.S. port congestion is not new. Ports need serious
capital investments to keep up with the rest of the world, as well as
better data sharing capabilities across the supply chain.

Railroads are struggling to move these containers too.
Since 2015, Class I railroads have slashed their workforce by almost 30
percent and closed several rail yards. In 2020 Class I railroads
reinvested $6.3 billion less in their capital programs than they did in
2015 and Wall Street pushed operating ratios and stock buybacks ever
higher.

Trucking companies have been struggling for a decade to
retain truckers, a direct result of real wages and working conditions
that are obstacles to attracting and retaining qualified drivers.

I am astonished that our supply chain industry representatives are
still calling the time we're in unprecedented. I thought business
metrics were done on a quarterly basis--I thought businesses were
nimble and able to turn on a dime, it's what I hear from colleagues all
the time on why we should reduce regulations on companies, but we're
eight quarters in and it appears to me that businesses are still
waiting for it to be 2019 again.
The freight network requires continued investment in capital,
private and public, and a skilled workforce that is adequately
compensated with reasonable working conditions. I am grateful to the
men and women in our transportation workforce who have remained on the
job despite the pandemic.
Today my colleagues on the other side will offer up a litany of
reasons why this is the Democrats' fault. They will offer solutions
that encourage low wages and abysmal working conditions. I expect to
hear that vaccine mandates, unemployment benefits, federal spending,
and climate emission reductions are worsening freight congestion. None
of that is true.
The simple answer is the private sector needs to be more nimble,
focus less on quarterly profits to appease Wall Street bigwigs, and
retain the resilience to meet surges in demand. The transportation
sector needs to invest more of their robust profits back into their
capital programs and should refrain from burdening employees with
impossible productivity metrics and unreasonable working conditions
that further the labor shortage.
Thinking about the big picture, I think this debate is another
clear example of the downside to unfettered free trade, where the U.S.
is now dependent on Asian nations for manufacturing. We wouldn't have
these levels of port congestion challenges if we made more products
here in the U.S.
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses about how they are
working together to address the short-term supply chain challenges. I
have no doubt that a number of them will use the opportunity today to
press for perennial priorities they have long sought, pandemic or
supply-chain challenges or not. For our part, Congress recently passed
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed on Monday by
President Biden. We're doing our part to make billions of dollars in
long-term investments in our freight supply chain, and I hope to hear
from witnesses how they will amplify those investments for future
generations.

Mr. DeFazio. With that I would recognize Ranking Member
Graves.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, and I want to thank our
witnesses for testifying today. And I am very interested to
hear what members of the panel have to say about the
bottlenecks in our Nation's supply chain, because it is truly a
crisis.
Thanksgiving stands to be the most expensive ever. And if
you are not getting ahead of your holiday shopping now, you are
likely going to find limited options the closer that we get to
Christmas. The general public, quite frankly, is extremely
concerned by this.
And every person that is going to be testifying today
represents essential workers who are feeling the impacts of
this crisis firsthand. The companies and workers that you
represent kept our economy running during COVID-19, during the
pandemic, and we all appreciate that work, and it is ongoing.
But the pandemic made us recognize that an efficient supply
chain could benefit from increased redundancies and capacities.
There isn't one simple solution, and that is a fact. As the
chairman pointed out, this is a very complex problem, and there
are many factors that contribute to the high cost of moving
goods throughout the Nation's supply chain.
But having said that, the policies that the President, the
Speaker, and Leader Schumer are pursuing are not only missing
the mark, but they are making matters worse. The radical agenda
that they continue to pursue through budget reconciliation and
administrative actions, it increases energy and transportation
costs, it discourages work, and it drives up already
skyrocketing inflation. And all of this is exacerbating the
problem; it is not fixing it.
For example, the President's press conference on October
13th demonstrated both a lack of understanding of this complex
issue, and the fact that his administration has no real plan to
solve it. I was personally offended by his call for the private
sector to step up, while his administration does very little
but compound the problem, specifically calling out terminal
operators, railways, trucking companies, shippers, and other
retailers. The companies and workers are not here to provide
cover to bail out the administration's bad policies. The 100
containerships sitting outside the Ports of Los Angeles and
Long Beach, they aren't just magically going to go away.
I also think we need to hear from those folks who aren't
here today, most notably the users of the system: importers,
the exporters, retail, agriculture, and the administration
officials that oversee it, including the newly announced
infrastructure czar.
Republican Members, we have already heard from many groups
and individuals who want to share their ideas on how to improve
this situation. In fact, just 2 weeks ago we convened a
roundtable meeting to hear what issues the stakeholders
themselves are facing.
So, I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses on
their ideas, even if it is highlighting how this administration
can simply do no harm or, in this case, do no more harm.
Do no more harm to our supply chain by straining the
workforce through the application of a vaccine mandate. Do no
more harm to our supply chain by turning a blind eye to State
and local regulations that are interfering with interstate
commerce. Do no more harm to our supply chain by encouraging
regulations that upend the independent contracting model that
so many in our supply chain work through. Do no more harm by
pushing environmental regulations that stop warehouses from
being built, or goods being moved by truck. Do no more harm to
our supply chain by pushing policies that disincentivize work
and vocational jobs.
I do look forward to hearing from our panelists today, and
with that, I yield back the balance.

and local regulations that are interfering with interstate commerce.
Do no more harm to our supply chain by encouraging regulations that
upend the independent contracting model that so many in our supply
chain work through.
Do no more harm by pushing environmental regulations that stop
warehouses from being built, or goods moving by truck.
Do no more harm to our supply chain by pushing policies that
disincentivize work and vocational jobs.
I look forward to hearing from the panelists today, and I yield
back the balance of my time.

Mr. DeFazio. I wish that whoever is in charge wouldn't mute
me. I can mute myself when necessary, thank you. I think I am
back on, I don't see my video. Hold on. There, if you--because
then, when you mute me, I have trouble getting my video back
on. The video will not go on. There. OK. Again, whoever is in
charge, please don't mute me. I can mute myself. Thank you.
I would now like to welcome the witnesses on our panel:
Mario Cordero, executive director, Port of Long Beach, on
behalf of the American Association of Port Authorities; Chris
Spear, president and chief executive officer, American Trucking
Associations; Ian Jefferies, president and chief executive
officer, Association of American Railroads; Anne Reinke,
president and chief executive officer, Transportation
Intermediaries Association; David Correll, lecturer,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Transportation
Logistics; and Greg Regan, president, Transportation Trades
Department, AFL-CIO.
Thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us today.
We look forward to your testimony.
Without objection, our witnesses' full statements will be
included in the record. And since your written testimony is
made part of the record, the committee asks that you limit your
oral testimony to 5 minutes. And, if possible, don't just read
something, but actually maybe react to other panelists, or
something I said, or Mr. Graves said, if you would like.
So, I would now recognize Representative Lowenthal for a
short introduction of Mr. Cordero.
Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Chairman DeFazio. I am honored to
introduce my friend, Mario Cordero, who is recognized as an
international maritime industry leader.
Mario is the executive director of the Port of Long Beach,
which is located in my district, and he has held this position
since 2017. I have had the privilege of working with Mario to
make sure that the Port of Long Beach is a clean, efficient,
and dynamic fixture of our community since he first joined the
Board of Harbor Commissioners in Long Beach in 2003.
I would like to also just point out that President Obama
appointed Mario to the Federal Maritime Commission in 2011, and
he was appointed as the Chair of the Commission from 2013 to
2017.
There are few people more qualified to speak on port
issues, and I look forward to his full testimony. Thank you,
Mr. Chair, and I yield back.
Mr. DeFazio. OK, thank you, Representative Lowenthal.
And with that I would now recognize Mario Cordero for 5
minutes.

Mr. Cordero. Good morning, Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member
Graves, and members of the committee. My name is Mario Cordero,
I am the executive director of the Port of Long Beach, and
chairman of the board of the American Association of Port
Authorities, a unified voice for the seaport industry in the
Americas.
I would like to thank the Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure for holding this hearing and soliciting input
from stakeholders in the supply chain regarding the challenges
we face and the critical investments needed.
I am speaking today on behalf of AAPA, and in my role as
executive director of the Port of Long Beach, but also as a
stakeholder in the White House Supply Chain Disruptions Task
Force.
Before I begin, I would like to first acknowledge the work
of the committee in crafting and passing the bipartisan
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act by infusing an
unprecedented $17 billion to improve infrastructure. We can
take real action to make our supply chain resilient.
AAPA represents 130 public port authorities in the United
States, Canada, the Caribbean, and Latin America. For more than
a century, the AAPA membership has empowered port authorities
and their maritime industry partners to serve global customers
and create economic and social value for their communities.
As the second busiest container seaport in the United
States, the Port of Long Beach handles trade valued at more
than $200 billion annually, and supports 2.6 million jobs
across the Nation. Together, with the Port of Los Angeles, the
San Pedro Bay Port Complex moves more than 40 percent of our
Nation's waterborne goods, making it the Nation's largest and
most strategic port complex.
The port has been at the forefront of seeking a framework
for extending hours of operation in the supply chain, with the
goal of 24/7, a framework I first referenced back in 2018, in
recognition of the cargo forecast at that time. Transitioning
to 24/7 operation will not only address supply chain backlogs,
but will also reduce truck congestion and move goods quicker
through the complex. Essentially, it is not only good for the
environment, but it does reduce costs throughout the supply
chain.
Our International Longshore and Warehouse Union partners
and essential workforce have kept the cargo moving as the
entire supply chain workforce. The supply chain workers are to
be commended for their tireless work to keep America moving.
While the ships anchored off the coast of Long Beach and
Los Angeles have garnered attention, U.S. ports are not the
only ones facing the congestion. In October, there were 180
container vessels anchored and waiting to dock off the coast of
China. Shipping is a global industry, with the onset of the
pandemic causing major disruption in shipping and
manufacturing, from which the global economy is still in a
recovery mode.
With the backing of the Biden administration, we are
working with marine terminal operators to expand their hours of
operation. When I met with President Joe Biden in the White
House in October, I learned that he too held a vision of a 24/7
supply chain. I was very encouraged to hear his support for
this bold concept.
The Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles are not the only
ports addressing backlogs. The Georgia Ports Authority recently
announced that they would convert five existing inland
facilities into container yards to ease congestion. This
project is possible, thanks to the cooperation with the White
House and the Department of Transportation, who announced that
ports would be able to repurpose unspent grant funds from past
projects to address supply chain congestion. The Georgia Ports
Authority will spend $8 million from past grants for this
project, and it is my hope that other ports will be able to
take advantage of this opportunity, as well.
I am hopeful that 24/7 operations will help mitigate the
current surge, setting a framework for how we do things
differently in the future. The San Pedro Bay Port Complex is on
track to move 20 million TEUs in containers in this year.
According to the current forecast, this number will only
increase in the coming years, thus requiring transformational
change in the Nation's most important supply chain region.
We need to build for the future. Federal attention must not
stop when the number of vessels at anchorage does return to
zero. We must make U.S. ports a national priority. For the
decade spanning 2018 through 2028, the AAPA identified $20
billion in multimodal and rail access needs for U.S. ports. The
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, along with the
accompanying surface transportation reauthorization, takes
significant steps towards making up this gap. The set-aside of
$5 billion for multimodal projects within the supplemental
funding of the RAISE program will direct much-needed funds
towards the kind of projects that get cargo moving more
efficiently.
I will note to the committee that the maritime ports create
$5.4 trillion in economic activity, annually, representing 26
percent of our Nation's GDP.
I want to thank U.S. Transportation Secretary Buttigieg for
working closely with the California State Transportation
Secretary David Kim to prioritize Federal funding for projects
that will help alleviate freight bottlenecks in the country's
largest port complex.
U.S. ports welcome the opportunity to pursue Federal funds
for emission reduction and clean energy projects authorized by
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The ports would
benefit from the funding to address climate change and energy
resiliency in the Build Back Better Act, and urges Congress to
advance that legislation. I applaud Congress for including in
the legislation $3.5 billion for new grant programs to invest
in electric equipment at the ports, and these investments will
help ports move cargo faster, improving the health of port
communities.
The Port of Long Beach and AAPA appreciates the support of
this committee, Congress, and the administration for working
with all of the stakeholders to create a more resilient supply
chain. The U.S. maritime industry will continue to evolve and
adapt for more efficient and a greener tomorrow.
Thank you so much to the committee, and I welcome your
questions in this hearing. And again, I appreciate your
engagement in this very important subject matter.
[Mr. Cordero's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Mario Cordero, Executive Director, Port of Long
Beach, on behalf of the American Association of Port Authorities
Good morning Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and members
of the Committee.
My name is Mario Cordero, and I am the Executive Director of the
Port of Long Beach (Port) and the Chairman of the Board of the American
Association of Port Authorities (AAPA), the unified voice of the
seaport industry in the Americas. I would like to thank the Committee
on Transportation and Infrastructure for holding this hearing and
soliciting input from stakeholders in the supply chain regarding the
challenges we face and the critical investments needed.
I am speaking to you today on behalf of AAPA and in my role as
Executive Director of the Port of Long Beach, but also as a stakeholder
in the White House Supply Chain Disruption Task Force. Before I begin,
I would first like to acknowledge the work of this Committee in
crafting and passing the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment & Jobs
Act. By infusing an unprecedented $17 billion to improve infrastructure
at coastal ports, inland ports, waterways, and land ports of entry
along the border, we can take real action to make our supply chain
resilient.
AAPA represents more than 130 public port authorities in the U.S.,
Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America. For more than a century, AAPA
membership has empowered port authorities and their maritime industry
partners to serve global customers and create economic and social value
for their communities.
The Port of Long Beach is the premier U.S. gateway for trans-
Pacific trade and a trailblazer in innovative goods movement, safety,
environmental stewardship and sustainability. As the second-busiest
container seaport in the United States, the Port of Long Beach handles
trade valued at more than $200 billion annually and supports 2.6
million jobs across the nation. The Port of Long Beach is one of the
few U.S. ports that can welcome today's largest vessels, serving 175
shipping lines with connections to 217 seaports around the world.
Together with the Port of Los Angeles, the San Pedro Bay Ports Complex
moves more than 40% of our nation's waterborne goods, making this the
nation's largest and most strategic Port complex.
In recognition of this Committee's role in authorizing U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers projects, I would like to note that the Port
recently received a signed Chief's Report for our deep draft navigation
study. I look forward to working with the Committee in seeing this
project authorized for construction in the forthcoming Water Resources
Development Act of 2022.
Goods moving through the Port of Long Beach originate in or are
destined for every congressional district in the United States. In
2020, the Port handled more than 8.1 million container units, achieving
the best year in its history. This year, we project to surpass that
record and move nearly 9 million container units.
The Port has been at the forefront of seeking a framework for
extending hours of operation in the supply chain, with the goal of 24-
7, a framework I first referenced back in January 2018, in recognition
of the cargo forecast at that time. Transitioning to 24-7 operations
will not only help address supply chain backlogs, but will also reduce
truck congestion and move goods quicker through the complex. With
Southern California highways already congested, implementing policies
that enable greater access for trucks outside of the normal workday
will reduce emissions from idling and enable truck drivers to get to
their destination quicker. Efficiency is not only good for the
environment, but reduces costs throughout the supply chain.
As I speak with you today, we have approximately 70 container ships
off the southern California coast, waiting to get into a berth at Long
Beach or at our neighbor, Los Angeles. The record was reached in late
October with 80 container ships at anchor or in drift areas. For those
who live and work in Long Beach, this recent phenomenon is a stunning
change of scenery. The normal number for container ships at anchor in
the ports complex is zero.
Thanks to our supply chain essential workforce, the Port of Long
Beach has not shut down for a single day during the pandemic. Our
International Longshore & Warehouse Union (ILWU) partners have kept the
cargo moving, as have the marine terminal operators, truck drivers,
rail workers, ship crews, tugboat crews, and the entire supply chain
workforce. Supply chain workers are to be commended for their tireless
work to keep America moving.
While ships anchored off the coast of Long Beach and Los Angeles
have garnered attention, U.S. ports are not the only ones facing record
congestion. As of October 22nd, there were 180 container vessels
anchored and waiting to dock off the coast of China. Following a major
typhoon in July, there were 361 vessels in China anchored and waiting
to dock.\1\

Shipping is a global industry. Backlogs overseas delay shipments in
the United States. The onset of the pandemic caused major disruption in
shipping and manufacturing from which the global economy is still in a
recovery mode.
As you will hear today, there are many reasons for the backlog in
our nation's supply chain. The surge in demand for consumer goods has
created bottlenecks at multiple points. Just as some of our coastal
ports are congested, so too are rail intermodal terminals in America's
heartland. To alleviate supply chain congestion, we need to address
shortages at each stage in the supply chain, which is why I am pleased
to be speaking alongside representatives from the truck and rail
industries today.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
During a recent briefing and tour of the Port with Congressman
Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Congressman Lou Correa (D-CA), Congressman Issa
framed the dilemma we are in quite simply as a ``200-car pileup.'' You
can focus all you want on the end of the pileup, but to get to the true
cause or causes of it, you need to look closely at the first vehicles
at the front of the crash and the conditions in which they were
driving.
My focus today will be to share with you some of the challenges we
are facing in our nation's supply chain pileup, what the Port of Long
Beach is doing in the short-term to resolve congestion and in the long-
term to prevent it from happening again, and to discuss ways the U.S.
government could help us solve this crisis to make the U.S. supply
chain stronger and more competitive. Essentially, we need
transformational change.
Short-Term Solutions
The Port of Long Beach has six container terminals which can handle
140-150,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). Despite our ability to
handle this level of cargo, current cargo demands are causing our
terminals to run out of space. Currently, ships waiting to dock at the
Port of Long Beach are carrying approximately 530,000 container units.
Compounding the challenge is that terminals are being utilized for
temporary container storage, something that no port terminal is
designed to handle. Together with the Port of Los Angeles, we are
working to create more capacity at our terminals and move cargo as
quickly as possible by implementing new measures to encourage the
timely movement of containers.
First, the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles have begun
implementing a surcharge for containers left too long on the terminals.
In the case of containers scheduled to move by truck, ocean carriers
will be charged for every container dwelling nine days or more. For
containers moving by rail, ocean carriers will be charged if the
container has dwelled for six days or more.
Second, beginning on November first, the ports intend to charge
ocean liner companies with cargo in those two categories $100 per
container, increasing in $100 increments per container per day.
And third, with the backing of the Biden Administration, we are
working with our marine terminal operators to expand their hours of
operation. When I met with President Biden in the White House in
October, I learned that he too held a vision for a 24-7 supply chain. I
was very encouraged to hear his support for this bold concept.
A few weeks before my meeting with President Biden, the Total
Terminals International (TTI) terminal in the Port of Long Beach agreed
to a pilot project to explore a framework for 24-7 operations. We have
been working with other supply chain partners to encourage them to use
the new hours at the TTI terminal.
Truckers and cargo owners are slowly warming to the expanded hours;
however, there is still ample opportunity for more deliveries during
the late shift from 3 a.m. to 7 a.m. and labor is available and on
call.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Buttigieg and U.S. Envoy John Porcari
have been instrumental in bringing large retail companies to the table
to move and unload containers during these extended hours.
Other terminals are ``flexing gates.'' This means they are opening
earlier and staying open later. Some are adding Friday night and
weekend gates.
The collaboration and commitments made by the Biden-Harris
Administration, ports, terminal operators, labor, retailers, warehouses
and cities are moving the needle in the right direction. We all come to
the table with drive, determination, expertise and commitment to
solving this crisis. The White House Supply Chain Disruption Task Force
will report our trials, errors, and successes on a biweekly basis. This
transparent process brings greater awareness to policy makers and the
public about the importance, complexity and fragility of this vital
component of our nation's economy.
Meanwhile, the Port's Short Term Overflow Resource--known as STOR--
has been successful. This 64-acre facility in the Port is working to
provide container transfer and temporary storage during this cargo
surge. Today, it has fourteen thousand containers at the site. We are
in the process of securing an additional 5 acres to provide more
temporary relief.
We also appreciate the California Governor's Office of Business and
Economic Development (GoBiz), under the leadership of Dee Dee Myers,
actively working with port terminals and trucking companies to identify
public and private land that can be used for temporary storage during
this surge.
The Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles are not the only American
ports addressing backlogs. The Georgia Ports Authority recently
announced it would convert five existing inland facilities into
container yards to ease congestion. By getting containers off the dock
and into these new facilities, space will clear up to unload further
container ships more efficiently. This project is possible thanks to
cooperation with the White House and Department of Transportation, who
announced that ports would be able to repurpose unspent grant funds
from past projects to address supply chain congestion. The Georgia
Ports Authority will spend $8 million from past grants for this
project, and it is my hope that other ports will be able to take
advantage of this opportunity as well.
Port of Long Beach terminals are also ramping up on-dock rail
operations, a priority component to further cargo velocity and diminish
congestion in our transportation highways. We grew from about 20
percent of cargo moving by rail on Port property earlier in the year,
to about 27 percent in the summer.
Along those lines, the Port of Long Beach and the Utah Inland Port
Authority are expecting to increase rail-hauled cargo. This will be
done with the development of more cost-effective and innovative
strategies aimed at moving goods quickly, safely and efficiently
between Long Beach and Utah.
I am hopeful that 24-7 operations will help mitigate this current
surge, setting a framework for how we do things differently in the
future. The San Pedro Bay Complex is forecasted to move 20 million TEUs
in the coming years, thus requiring transformational change in the
nation's most important supply chain region.
24-7 operations cannot be implemented overnight. The Port of Long
Beach has taken the first step, and we look forward to other links in
the supply chain joining us.
Mid- to Long-Term Solutions
In 1995, the Port of Long Beach developed a comprehensive master
plan to identify critical infrastructure improvements needed to ensure
that Port operations could handle cargo forecasts. The Port Master Plan
has been amended a dozen times to incorporate specific projects. In
2019, the Port updated the full plan to reflect new laws, regulations
and policies adopted over the last three decades. Because of these
proactive efforts, several major infrastructure investments came online
in the last year and a half and have served as tremendous assets in
helping the Port to address global congestion. The first was the
replacement of the Gerald Desmond Bridge in 2020. Imagine that up until
then, 15% of the cargo moved by truck in the U.S. travelled across a
dilapidating bridge with only two lanes and no emergency shoulders. The
new bridge, named the Long Beach International Gateway, has four lanes
plus shoulders, allowing little to no disruption on this important
supply chain artery.
The second project, which came online in June 2021, is the
completion of the electrified Long Beach Container Terminal (LBCT),
which immediately added one million TEUs of capacity to the Port.
These two projects cost more than $3 billion, but the return on
investment was immediately realized. Without these investments, I
assure you we would have more supply chain bottlenecks and vessels at
anchorage. We also recognize that there is more work to be done and
more investments to be made to modernize the flow of goods through the
Port. The Port of Long Beach plans on investing more than $1 billion in
on-dock rail projects alone, which will help us move about 35% of our
cargo via rail by 2030. Pier B will increase use of on-dock railyards
by 157,000 TEUs annually. This project will result in the faster
movement of goods and will eliminate approximately 224,000 annual truck
trips, resulting in less congestion and better air quality.
While we institute short- and mid-term solutions, we need to look
at the big picture and build for the future. Federal attention must not
stop when the number of vessels at anchorage returns to zero. We must
make U.S. ports a national priority all the time, not just in crisis.
Every single American relies on seaports every day, and investing in
this infrastructure will benefit American businesses and consumers in
every state.
For the decade spanning 2018 through 2028, AAPA identified $20
billion in multimodal and rail access needs at U.S. ports. The
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, along with the accompanying
Surface Transportation Reauthorization, takes significant steps towards
making up this gap. In particular, the ports industry is pleased to see
the cap on multimodal projects raised for the Infrastructure for
Rebuilding America (INFRA) grant program. Additionally, the set-aside
of $5 billion for multimodal projects within the supplemental funding
for the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and
Equity (RAISE) grant program will direct much needed funds towards the
kind of projects that get cargo moving more efficiently from ships to
rail and trucks. I applaud this Committee and Congress for taking these
steps to increase parity between funding for port infrastructure needs
and those of other modes of transportation. I look forward to working
with this Committee and the Department of Transportation to ensure that
port multimodal projects are funded adequately through the INFRA,
RAISE, and Consolidated Rail and Infrastructure Safety Improvements
(CRISI) grant programs, all of which received billions of dollars in
funding through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
Maritime ports create $5.4 trillion in economic activity annually,
representing 26% of our Nation's GDP. Ports are responsible for 30.8
million direct, induced, and indirect jobs. Ports exist to facilitate
an integrated, end-to-end supply chain. We optimize goods movement. We
build and invest. Ports serve as an engine for economic prosperity in
our local communities and provide access to markets across the globe
for communities nationwide. But, we cannot do it alone. We need the
U.S. federal government to be our partners.
I want to thank U.S. Transportation Secretary Buttigieg for working
closely with California State Transportation Secretary David Kim to
prioritize federal funding for projects that will help alleviate
freight bottlenecks in the country's largest and most financially
important port complex.
The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) is going to create a
playbook for states on how to use grant and loan programs to support
the movement of goods. I applaud USDOT and the White House for
committing to opening the competitive grant process for $240 million
through the Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP) within 45
days and an additional $475 million from the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act within 90 days. USDOT will develop and issue revised
guidance on State Freight Plans that incorporates best worldwide
freight planning practices. Freight plans will include supply chain
cargo flows, an inventory of commercial ports, the impacts of e-
commerce on freight infrastructure, and an assessment of truck parking
facilities. These more holistic plans will help the federal and state
governments be more strategic in directing funding and resources to the
greatest economic development needs in the supply chain.
Greening U.S. Ports While Remaining Competitive
The Port of Long Beach is on track for a greener future, creating
the world's most modern, efficient and sustainable seaport. The Ports
of Long Beach and Los Angeles were at the forefront of environmental
stewardship with their adoption of its Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP or
Plan) in 2006, which was updated in 2010 and again in 2017. The Plan
yielded reductions of 88% diesel particulate matter, 97% sulfur oxides,
58% nitrogen oxides, and 19% greenhouse gas emissions.
Programs, such as the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) have
been instrumental in implementation of our forward-thinking
environmental initiatives.
As part of its industry-leading $4 billion capital improvement
program, the Port is building some of the most modern, efficient, and
sustainable marine facilities in the world to accommodate bigger ships,
while generating thousands of new jobs. The Port has made great strides
in reducing harmful air emissions from port-related operations,
improving water quality in the harbor, protecting marine wildlife, and
implementing environmentally sustainable practices throughout the Port.
The Port of Long Beach is investing in renewable energy and
terminal improvements with the goal of transitioning terminal cargo-
handling equipment to zero emissions by 2030 and on-road drayage trucks
by 2035, at a cost of more than $14 billion.
The Port is undertaking energy initiatives that will provide
reliability, resiliency, and economic competitiveness to the Port of
Long Beach, the San Pedro Bay Ports Complex and its marine terminal
tenants. Renewable energy technologies, other self-generation systems,
controls, and energy storage will allow the Port to isolate operations
from the local energy grid during times of emergency or outage. The
entire Port community will benefit from the Port's reduced demand for
grid power, a lowered carbon footprint, and improved air quality as the
equipment we use changes from diesel- to electricity-powered.
The Port is committed to reducing congestion and air emissions that
are harmful to our neighbors and the region. As I previously mentioned,
we see on-dock rail capabilities as providing a critical environmental
benefit by enabling more containers to be loaded directly onto rail and
thereby reducing the number of trucks required to serve the Port,
furthering the efficient movement of cargo.
The Port will pursue federal funds for emission reduction and clean
energy projects authorized in the Infrastructure Investment in Jobs
Act. The Port would benefit from funding to address climate change and
energy resiliency in the Build Back Better Act and urges Congress to
advance that legislation. I applaud Congress for including in that
legislation $3.5 billion for a new grant program to invest in electric
equipment at ports. A recent survey of AAPA members revealed a need of
$50 billion for port electrification projects the next ten years. These
include purchasing electric cargo-handling equipment, shore power
projects, electric grid improvements, and hydrogen fuel production. All
of these investments will help ports move cargo faster while improving
the health of port communities. As ports around the world shift towards
electric equipment, it is critical we not fall behind. Unless we re-
shore crane and cargo-handling equipment manufacturing, we will
continue subsidizing machine yards in Europe and Southeast Asia. I
respectfully request that this Committee continue working with the
ports and manufacturing industries to re-shore the manufacture of this
equipment. Federal funding for electric equipment at ports will spur a
new market of American-made machinery.
To create greater efficiencies and improve air quality and the
health of our planet, we need to make significant investments in the
supply chain workforce.
The Port of Long Beach is committed to creating and supporting
programs that advance the development of a skilled workforce in
international trade, goods movement and related professions, such as
advanced technology, engineering, and environmental sciences. We have
forged fruitful partnerships with the Long Beach Unified School
District, Long Beach City College, and California State University,
Long Beach, creating a workforce pipeline to port-related industries.
Additionally, the Port of Long Beach Academy of Global Logistics at
Cabrillo and Jordan high schools combines academic curriculum with
industry-relevant training and information to support academic and
career development.
Together with the Port of Los Angeles, and the ILWU, the Port of
Long Beach is about to embark on building a $150 million Workforce
Training Campus, where port workers throughout the U.S. will be able to
get hands-on training in a simulated terminal environment. Receiving
substantial hours of training in a safe environment that does not
disrupt port operations will result in safer operations and greater
efficiencies at our ports. We also hope to test new green innovations
in this space to help prepare labor to use and repair these new
technologies. Investments in supply chain workforce training are vital
to our success to maintain a competitive edge and protect our
environment.
The Port of Long Beach and AAPA appreciate the support of this
Committee, Congress, and the Administration for working with all
stakeholders to create a more resilient supply chain.
The pandemic has tested every aspect of our lives in ways that we
could have never imagined, but the U.S. maritime industry will continue
to evolve and adapt for a more efficient and greener tomorrow.
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the Committee, I would
be more than happy to answer any questions you may have.

Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Mr. Cordero.
Now on to Mr. Spear, the American Trucking Associations.
Mr. Spear. Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and
members of this committee, good morning.
Our Nation's supply chain is made up of a complex series of
contributing factors, including modes and intermodal
connectors, sourcing, and talent pools governed by several
jurisdictions of laws and regulations. Most recently, we
witnessed a chronic slow return to work across all segments of
the economy, trucking included, compounded by the growing
backlog of ships at ports, container displacement, chassis and
yard shortages, chip and sensor shortages, trade and tariffs,
immigration, and cross-border enforcement, the Colonial
Pipeline hack, the Suez Canal blockage, decaying
infrastructure, an increasing number of natural disasters, all
topped off with a global pandemic.
This is the 25th time ATA has testified on these factors in
the last 5 years. Again, it's in my written testimony, so let
me just zero in on two supply chain factors that remain ATA
front-burner priorities.
First is infrastructure. This issue has been and remains a
tier 1 priority for our members in industry. It has always been
about what is best for the country. This is about real people
getting the job done when it matters most, and this pandemic
has been no exception. For trucking, that is nearly 8 million
people, 1 in 18 jobs in America, where a truckdriver is the top

Roads and bridges aren't political theater. They're our
shop floor. That is what we have been telling Congress for the
last 5 years, so it shouldn't surprise anyone on this committee
as to why we supported this bipartisan infrastructure bill, and
why we will remain very vocal about why it is the most
important, historic, immediate, and impactful decision that
directly addresses our Nation's ailing supply chain.
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act became law
because a majority in Congress decided to put the country ahead
of themselves. My members repeatedly asked, begged for this to
happen. Here is why. Since the pandemic began, truckers
continued to serve America, moving 72.5 percent of the Nation's
freight tonnage, and serving more than 80 percent of U.S.
communities that exclusively rely on trucks--milk, eggs, bread,
fuel, PPE, test kits, and now the vaccine itself.
So, as you turn to oversight, it is going to be critical
that discretionary moneys address congestion in the top
bottlenecks and intermodal connectors, of which 70 percent are
State and local jurisdiction, and that funding be provided, as
the chairman said, for truck parking, like in the House-passed
bill, which costs the average driver $5,500 in direct
compensation, annually.
Second, the slow return to post-pandemic work. Matching
talent with consumer demand has long been a headwind for our
industry. Truckers entered COVID-19 short 61,500 drivers, now
at 80,000 short as we exit the pandemic. These annually
reported numbers are sound and accurate. They reflect what any
one of you would experience waiting for service at a
restaurant, standing in longer lines at a grocery store
checkout, or even flying and experiencing the added delays and
cancellations, not from weather, but from airline crews unable
to keep up with a surge in travel.
Pay has increased substantially, especially in the most
challenging sectors of our industry. Long-haul earnings, for
instance, are up 24.3 percent since the beginning of 2019, and
increasing at five times their historic average, which is
nearly 10 percent, year over year. Yet the shortage and the
retention of talent remains, elevating other contributing
factors, including lifestyle changes, more time with family,
work flexibility choices that only independent contractors
enjoy, time lost from severe congestion, and detention time,
and the added layers of mandates, including requiring our
workforce to vaccinate for a job that has one of the lowest
risk and exposure rates in the country.
Apprenticeships that train younger talent to safely and
responsibly operate this equipment will help, thanks to the
language from the bipartisan DRIVE Safe Act included in the
IIJA. But we need to do more: urban hiring, including more
minorities and women, more veterans and exiting military
personnel, harmonizing CDL testing requirements and, of course,
taking care of our current workforce, including retirement
incentives and stronger health and wellness programs, all
things our industry is not just doing, but committed to doing
better.
Now, I recognize the divisive environment we all find
ourselves. So, let me close with this. Stop blaming everyone
for the things you don't do, and start taking credit for the
things you should do.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

thank you for providing me with the opportunity to testify before you
today.

\1\ American Trucking Associations is the largest national trade
association for the trucking industry. Through a federation of 50
affiliated state trucking associations and industry-related conferences
and councils, ATA is the voice of the industry America depends on most
to move our nation's freight. Follow ATA on Twitter or on Facebook.
Trucking Moves America Forward.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ATA is an 88-year-old federation and the largest national trade
organization representing the 7.65 million men and women working in the
trucking industry. ATA is a fifty-state federation that encompasses
34,000 motor carriers and their affiliated suppliers. ATA represents
every sector of the industry, from Less-than-Truckload to Truckload,
agriculture and livestock transporters to auto haulers and movers, and
from the large motor carriers to owner-operators as well as mom-and-pop
one-truck operations. ATA member companies have overcome tremendous
challenges over the past twenty months and continue to adjust as
inefficiencies intensify disruptions in international and domestic
supply chains.
Despite mounting challenges, the trucking industry continues to
play a critical role in sustaining our nation's economy. Trucks deliver
critical foodstuffs to store shelves, personal protective equipment
(PPE) to our nation's first responders, and gasoline to every community
nationwide. We enable flexible multimodal supply chains by moving goods
the last mile from maritime, rail, air, and intermodal facilities.
Truck drivers perform an indispensable service, and their work moving
goods across the country is vital to our economy and way of life.
The trucking industry moves over 70 percent of the nation's freight
tonnage every year \2\, and more than 80 percent of U.S. communities
rely exclusively on trucking to meet their freight transportation
needs. Over the next decade, trucks will be tasked with moving 2.4
billion more tons of freight than they do today, and will continue to
deliver the vast majority of goods to American communities.\3\ The
trucking industry is also one of the country's leading employers,
including over 3.6 million drivers.\4\ Trucking accounts for one out of
every eighteen American jobs, and ``truck driver'' is the top job in 29
states.\5\

As evidenced by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as
highlighted by the current challenges facing our supply chains,
trucking is the dynamic linchpin of the U.S. economy. When trucks are
not operating efficiently, those slowdowns reverberate throughout the
supply chain, and our supply chain partners feel the secondary impact
on both the front- and back-ends. The supply chain is inherently
interconnected and multimodal, and the supply chain issues we are
witnessing today are a result of years of inaction that allowed small
problems to metastasize into nationwide disruptions.
This hearing presents a unique opportunity for key supply chain
stakeholders to highlight major headwinds for freight transportation,
and for this Committee to consider targeted solutions that improve the
safety, efficiency, and resiliency of the supply chain during this
ongoing national recovery. Deteriorating roads and bridges, severe
congestion, freight bottlenecks, and unprecedented backlogs of cargo at
our U.S. ports and inland terminals all place significant strains on
the trucking industry and our supply chain partners, and absent short-
term and long-term remedies, these problems could permanently inflate
the cost of moving goods.
Also, in spite of the dangers posed by the pandemic, America's
truckers proudly answered the call to deliver necessities across the
country around-the-clock without interruption. Truckers perform their
duties irrespective of the challenges brought on by public health
emergencies, dilapidated and failing infrastructure, rising equipment
costs, and intrusive regulatory burdens that make it difficult for
companies to operate. But we need your help to ensure we can continue
to deliver for the American people.
As the Committee examines the nation's supply chain challenges, I
ask that you please consider four key areas: 1) infrastructure
investment, 2) workforce development, 3) challenges created by
equipment and labor shortages at U.S. maritime ports, inland storage
facilities, and distribution centers, and 4) potential consequences of
an employer-based vaccine mandate. I will address each of these areas
in detail in my testimony, as they are critical to ensuring the
economic vitality and competitiveness of the American trucking industry
and broader supply chain.
Thank you for holding today's hearing to consider these critical
issues. I look forward to working with you to share information and
inform potential opportunities to alleviate these supply chain
disruptions and protect the safe and efficient movement of our nation's
goods.
Key Issues for the Commercial Trucking Industry:
1) Infrastructure Investment:
Well-maintained, reliable, and efficient infrastructure is crucial
to the delivery of our nation's freight--both international and
domestic--and is vital to our country's economic and social well-being.
That is why ATA applauds the November 5th House passage of the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), a broadly bipartisan
bill that will provide important investments to maintain and improve
our core interstate system. Importantly, this bill also targets
additional funding for intermodal freight connectors and projects of
national significance that are critical for supply chain continuity.
ATA strongly and vocally supported this important legislation, and we
are pleased that Congress has finally moved to ensure that the roads
and bridges that carry the nation's economy are safe, reliable, and
prepared for future growth.
Enactment of the IIJA is all the more important in the context of
the escalating problems that plague our supply chain and the nation's
highway infrastructure. Highway congestion, for example, adds nearly
$75 billion to the cost of freight transportation each year.\6\ In
2016, truck drivers sat in traffic for nearly 1.2 billion hours,
equivalent to more than 425,000 drivers sitting idle for a year.\7\
This caused the trucking industry to consume an additional 6.87 billion
gallons of fuel in 2016, representing approximately 13% of the
industry's fuel consumption, and resulting in 67.3 million metric tons
of excess carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.\8\

Research Institute, Feb. 2019.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congestion serves as a brake on economic growth and job creation
nationwide. A first-world economy cannot survive a developing-world
infrastructure system. As such, the federal government has an
obligation to ensure that necessary resources are available to address
this self-imposed and completely solvable situation. More specifically,
ATA recommends that at least $5 billion in federal-aid highway funds
should be set aside annually to address highway bottlenecks in key
freight corridors that drastically impede the efficient movement of
goods. Furthermore, given the importance of the National Highway
System--and especially the Interstate System--to the supply chain, a
greater share of federal investment should be directed toward the
maintenance and improvement of these highways.
Another barrier to supply chain efficiency is the poor state of
freight intermodal connectors--those roads that connect ports, rail
yards, airports and other intermodal facilities to the National Highway
System. While they are an essential part of the freight distribution
system, many are neglected and are not given the attention they deserve
given their importance to the nation's economy. Just 9% of intermodal
connectors are in good or very good condition, 35% are in fair
condition, 19% are in mediocre condition, and 37% are in poor
condition.\9\ Not only do poor roads damage both vehicles and the
freight they carry, but the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) found
a correlation between poor roads and vehicle speed. Average speed on a
connector in poor condition was 22% lower than on a connector in fair
or better condition.\10\ FHWA further found that congestion on freight
intermodal connectors causes 1,059,238 hours of truck delay annually
and 12,181,234 hours of automobile delay.\11\ Congestion on freight
intermodal connectors adds nearly $71 million to freight transportation
costs each year.\12\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
One possible reason connectors are neglected is that the vast
majority of these roads--70%--are under the jurisdiction of a local or
county government.\13\ Yet, these roads are serving critical regional,
national, and international needs well beyond the geographic boundaries
of the jurisdictions that have responsibility for them, and these
broader benefits may not be factored into the local jurisdictions'
spending decisions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While intermodal connectors are eligible for federal funding under
formula programs, it is clear that simple eligibility does not yield
the results our country and the supply chain need. ATA supports a set-
aside of funding for freight intermodal connectors to ensure that these
critical arteries are given the attention and resources they deserve.
Additionally, we advise against federal policies that are likely to
prevent or hamstring state and local agencies' efforts to expand
highway capacity. This includes conditioning the expenditure of federal
funds for new capacity on a showing that alternatives, such as
operational strategies or investment in alternative transportation
modes, are definitively ruled out. The National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) process already requires the consideration of alternatives,
and layering additional requirements onto the existing process would be
unnecessary, costly, and cumbersome. We also urge any policies that
seek to eliminate or downgrade highways in the name of equity or
environmental justice fully take into consideration the impacts of
these approaches on supply chain efficiency.
While the IIJA did not set aside funding for either highway
bottleneck elimination or intermodal connectors, these projects are
eligible for funding under several of the discretionary programs,
including the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects
Program, the Bridge Investment Program, the National Infrastructure
Project Assistance Program, and the Local and Regional Project
Assistance Program. Congress should provide the necessary oversight to
ensure that the resources available from these important programs are
used primarily for projects that improve transportation safety and
mobility, and that address infrastructure deficiencies that contribute
to supply chain inefficiencies. These programs should not be used to
advance parochial agendas that are outside of their Congressionally-
mandated scope.
A further barrier to supply chain efficiency is the shortage of
truck parking, which has been well documented for decades. In 2015, the
FHWA's Jason's Law report recognized the shortage of truck parking
capacity as a serious highway safety concern. The FHWA found that more
than 75 percent of truck drivers and almost 66 percent of logistics
personnel ``regularly [experienced] problems with finding safe parking
locations when rest was needed.'' Due to inaction at the federal,
state, and local level, the truck parking shortage has only worsened
since 2016. In 2019, the FHWA found that the percentage of drivers who
regularly experienced difficulty finding truck parking had skyrocketed
from 75 percent to 98 percent. The truck parking shortage is not just a
safety and compliance issue; it is also an economic issue for drivers
and fleets. Time spent looking for available truck parking costs the
average driver about $5,500 in direct lost compensation--or a 12% cut
in annual pay. Truck drivers give up an average of 56 minutes of
available drive time per day by parking early rather than risk being
unable to find parking down the road. The result is declining industry
productivity and further depletion of the driver pool, both of which
contribute to supply chain inefficiencies.
Federal investment in the expansion of trucking parking capacity is
key to addressing this problem. ATA thanks the committee for including
$1 billion in its surface transportation bill for truck parking
capacity expansion. Unfortunately, the IIJA did not include dedicated
funding for truck parking. We encourage Congress to seek other
opportunities to address this critical problem.
Underpinning all of these recommendations is the need for a long-
term, stable revenue source. Without one, states will find it difficult
to commit to funding crucial and expensive projects. The fuel tax has,
for at least a century, provided that stable income. However, a failure
to increase the rate of the federal fuel tax since 1993 has caused the
value of the revenue generated to be significantly reduced due to
inflation. While the fuel tax will likely have to be replaced or
supplemented at some point, it will be a viable revenue source for at
least the next decade, and the rate of tax should be raised and indexed
to inflation. In the meantime, the Administration should work with
Congress, the states, and the private sector to find a viable
replacement for the fuel tax that can provide stable highway funding
for the foreseeable future. The IIJA included funding for national,
state, and local pilot programs to explore new revenue sources. ATA
looks forward to working with USDOT and grant recipients to implement a
robust and comprehensive research and testing program.
2) Workforce Development:
The trucking industry, which serves as the linchpin of our nation's
economy and supply chain, has faced an escalating driver shortage over
the past years. The driver shortage is the result of many concurrent
factors, but the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the trucking industry's
already-dire labor constraints. The COVID-19 pandemic brought with it
the temporary closures of state DMV's and truck driver training
schools, which dried up the already-fragile pipeline of new drivers
entering the trucking industry. This pipeline is still slow and
inefficient today. As a result, companies working throughout the
nation's supply chain are facing higher transportation costs, leading
to increased prices for consumers on everything from electronics to
food. The driver shortage is a looming threat that, if unaddressed,
could destabilize the continuity of trucking operations with a ripple
effects across the supply chain that will be felt by everyday
Americans.
According to statistics released within the last month, the
trucking industry is currently short 80,000 drivers.\14\ That deficit
will only continue to grow unless Congress and regulators modernize
regulations that govern who can drive in interstate commerce and make
targeted investments in programs to attract a new, diverse generation
of drivers and supply chain workers to the transportation industry.
Without substantial action, by 2030 and at current trends, the driver
shortage could grow to 160,000.\15\ Overall, nearly one million new
drivers will need to be trained and hired in the next decade to keep
pace with increasing consumer demand and an aging workforce.\16\

The trucking industry offers fulfilling careers with family-
sustaining salaries--all without the debt that often accompanies a
college degree--but obsolete regulatory barriers prevent the trucking
industry from offering these pathways to recent high school graduates
who may otherwise want to pursue a career in trucking. The Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS) reported a mean salary of $47,130 for truck
drivers in a May 2020 report.\17\ Additionally, an industry survey
shows the average truck driver earns over $54,000 per year, plus
benefits like health insurance, a retirement plan (e.g., 401(k)), and
paid time off.\18\ Since 2014, private fleet drivers have seen their
pay rise from $73,000 to more than $86,000, or a gain of nearly
18%.\19\ In addition to rising pay, many fleets offer generous signing
bonuses and other expanded benefits packages to attract and keep
drivers. We want to welcome more individuals into the trucking
industry, but we need Congress' help to open up career pathways that
are currently closed to qualified people due to outdated regulatory
barriers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To that end, ATA is pleased that the IIJA included important
workforce development programs that we believe will create new career
pathways into trucking. ATA is particularly enthusiastic about three
provisions, including a pilot program (based on the DRIVE Safe Act,
H.R.1745) that will allow highly-trained younger drivers to operate in
interstate commerce, the establishment of an advisory board to promote
the recruitment and retention of women in the trucking workforce (based
on the Promoting Women in Trucking Workforce Act, H.R.1341), and the
authorization of a program to promote and improve job opportunities for
a diverse transportation workforce (based on the Promoting Service in
Transportation Act, H.R.3310).
The DRIVE Safe Act pilot program will allow the U.S. Department of
Transportation to collect the data to show what 49 states and the
District of Columbia already recognize: that 18-to-20-year-olds can be
trained to operate safely in interstate commerce and help meet the
critical need for 80,000 new truck drivers nationwide. Currently,
federal regulations require an individual to be 21 years of age in
order to operate a commercial vehicle across state lines or transport
interstate freight. This, despite the fact that a driver--today--can
obtain their commercial driver's license (CDL) between the ages of 18-
20 and operate solely within state lines in 49 states and the District
of Columbia. This pilot program will enable 3,000 drivers to operate in
interstate commerce once they have successfully completed a rigorous
training program. Ultimately, the data generated from this pilot
program will demonstrate that young drivers can add critically-needed
resilience and capacity to national supply chains if they receive the
appropriate training in trucks equipped with the latest safety
technology. To qualify to operate in interstate commerce under the
pilot program, drivers must complete 400 hours of training using
leading safety equipment, including 240 hours with an experienced
mentor, on top of the current minimum requirements to obtain a CDL for
drivers of all ages. The capacity that can be unlocked by bringing
safe, trained, younger drivers into the workforce is critically
important to ensuring the supply chain continuity that has eluded us
for so long. Make no mistake, this pilot program is not a step toward
allowing untrained individuals to operate a CMV, but rather a data-
driven innovation designed to identify those individuals who can, with
the correct amount of training, safely operate a CMV in interstate
commerce.
The IIJA provisions based on the Promoting Women in Trucking
Workforce Act and the Promoting Service in Transportation Act are also
important tools for our nation's supply chains to attract a younger and
more diverse workforce. Although women currently make up 47% of the
workforce, only 7% of truck drivers are women \20\ and only roughly 26%
of all transportation and warehousing jobs are held by women.\21\ For
too long, blue-collar professions like trucking have been stigmatized,
and the disproportionate emphasis on four-year colleges at the expense
of vocational schools and the skilled trades has discouraged too many
potential drivers from getting behind the wheel. ATA supports both of
these important legislative efforts and applauds their inclusion in the
IIJA.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The inclusion of these workforce provisions in the IIJA will take
significant steps in establishing new career pathways into the trucking
industry. Broadening and diversifying the talent pools from which the
trucking industry recruits will help to alleviate a significant
pressure point imperiling the supply chain.
As this Committee and Congress consider additional measures to
address the current supply chain disruptions, the truck driver shortage
and workforce development should be major focal points of any future
action. Given that the current shortage of truck drivers stands at
80,000, an immediate option for consideration should be an emergency
funding authorization of workforce training dollars for job
opportunities in essential critical infrastructure workforces, like the
trucking industry. By subsidizing CDL training and testing, Congress
can help qualified individuals overcome the financial barriers to entry
and assist in an immediate infusion of trained drivers to allay current
supply chain pressures. Similarly, ATA supports the enactment of the
JOBS Act (H.R.2037), which would make CDL Training and Truck Driving
Schools more likely to be eligible to receive federal Pell Grant
funding, enabling workers to obtain the necessary credentials to join
the trucking workforce without incurring significant debt. That all
being said, ATA believes that any legislative proposals to expand the
trucking workforce must be supported by the appropriate safety
standards and performance criteria.
ATA also appreciates and supports the steps government agencies
have taken to address driver recruitment bottlenecks, such as issuing
emergency waivers and declarations during the pandemic, and we believe
some of those should be made permanent.
For example, permanent waivers on certain requirements for
Commercial Learners Permits (CLP) and Third-Party Testing could assist
in easing the current delays associated with the testing of drivers who
wish to obtain their CDL. These delays existed prior to the COVID-19
public health crisis and have only been exacerbated by the pandemic.
ATA anticipates that the existing backlog of testing appointments will
steadily increase in the future and encourages the Federal Motor
Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to harmonize state licensing
procedures, including, for example, state of domicile requirements and
Third-Party Testing.
FMCSA has mandated that an individual's state of domicile must
accept the results of a CDL skills test that was administered out-of-
state; however, the rule does not require the state of domicile to also
accept the results of an out-of-state knowledge test. As a result,
driver candidates who obtain training out-of-state are required to
travel back to their state of domicile to obtain their credentials,
creating an unnecessary burden. It has become all the more important to
allow trainees to test, train, and receive their relevant credentials--
be it a CLP or a CDL--without having to travel back and forth to their
state of domicile during the pandemic, and there's no safety
justification that would warrant returning to that requirement as we
recover from the public health crisis.
Finally, I would be remiss if I did not address a piece of
legislation that would be extremely harmful to the trucking industry
and hurt the very workers it purports to help: the Protecting the Right
to Organize (PRO) Act (H.R.842). The PRO Act, which I know many of you
support, includes a provision that would effectively bar the trucking
industry from utilizing the independent contractor business model. The
trucking industry, American consumers, and the integrity of the
nation's supply chain depend on independent contractors, and the
implementation of a restrictive national test to limit independent
contractor status would jeopardize the livelihoods of over 350,000
owner-operators, destabilizing America's supply chain and irreparably
harming the U.S. economy.
The involvement of independent contractors in trucking promotes
efficiency and an increased ability to meet customer demand, which has
been acutely necessary during heightened delivery periods like the
COVID-19 pandemic, and annually during the peak holiday season.
Americans choose to work as independent contractors because of the
economic opportunity it provides and the empowerment to select the
conditions (e.g., hours and routes) that suit their lifestyles.
Accordingly, the Americans who choose to become owner-operators in
trucking should be respected and supported in their endeavors, not
driven out of business because of the authoritarian view that employee
status is better for them.
3) Port Productivity Challenges:
As media and policymakers focus on the backlog of imported cargo at
U.S. maritime ports, particularly on the West Coast, it is an
opportunity to examine the long-term trends in port practices that
reduce the resilience of supply chains. Volumes are surging at a time
when labor and equipment shortages leave inland distributors unable to
accommodate the demand. Inabilities to process cargo at ports, dray
import and export containers between ports and inland distribution
facilities, and transport inland goods efficiently between production
facilities and warehouses all create challenges for the overall supply
chain. Ultimately, there is an incentive misalignment between major
players in the supply chain, and in order to move cargo efficiently at
ports, all supply chain partners should, at a minimum, share that
mutual goal.
The entire supply chain would benefit from steps to incentivize
communication between supply chain partners, realign financial
incentives by modernizing regulations related to detention and
demurrage charges by ocean carriers and marine terminal operators, and
address the chassis and equipment shortage.
Improving Communication
Private sector supply chain partners need to continue improving
their communication to avoid supply chain breakdowns in the face of
peak season demands, a lack of carrier capacity, limited equipment
availability, and ongoing labor supply challenges. Congress and federal
regulators must understand the full context of the current and
potential bottlenecks in order to respond accordingly with effective
and meaningful relief.
For instance, a port remaining open 24/7 will do little to increase
the flexibility of the supply chain if the port does not have adequate
equipment available to move containers, or is slow to process the
trucks that serve the facilities, or if inland warehouses are full or
only staffed to open their shipping docks for limited hours. Solutions
should focus on addressing the constraints specific to those port
facilities, not merely increasing the amount of time a driver can
operate in order to overcome the inefficiencies.
In addition to the delays and limited hours of operation at inland
facilities complicating the carriage of goods to and from ports, the
ports themselves struggle with disjointed information sharing. ATA
members working in intermodal freight, report that information systems
and notifications vary substantially between facilities. Each terminal
within a larger port often has its own information sharing system, an
inefficient state of affairs for truck drivers and supply chain
participants that would otherwise benefit from more global availability
of information. For example, truckers working at ports often must
return containers or chassis at one terminal then pick up new equipment
at a different terminal, a process complicated by the fact that most
terminals within a port operate on different appointment systems. Short
notice of constantly-changing windows of availability for cargo and
equipment pickup and drop-off at each terminal only increases the level
of miscommunication.
Modernizing Incentives at Ports
Too often, the delays for pickup and return of equipment and cargo
for the movement of goods at ports are due to circumstances beyond
motor carriers' control. Part of the challenge is in obtaining the
necessary equipment, particularly chassis, to move containers to
warehouses. Additionally, labor shortages at those inland facilities
can slow the loading and unloading of goods. Federal hours of service
regulations do not account for or accommodate labor challenges, so the
time a driver spends waiting on a chassis to move goods from the port,
or missing the delivery window at an inland facility because of delays
at the port is unrecoverable. Drivers and equipment are critical
resources for the overall supply chain, and ensuring effective
utilization of both is critical to alleviating the current port backlog
and strengthening long-term efficiency.
The answer to these myriad challenges is not increasing the amount
of time a driver can be on-duty, but rather restoring financial
incentives for ocean carriers and marine terminal operators to work
with shippers and carriers to move goods efficiently. Steamship lines
and marine terminal operators should not benefit from unreasonable
demurrage charges when cargo is not made available to carriers and
shippers in a timely manner, and they should not be able to levy unfair
charges for the late return of containers when there is no space for
the carrier or shipper to return the equipment or when terminals are
not open.
If drivers are unable to return a container and obtain the proper
chassis, they cannot pick up their next container, slowing operations
and contributing to the buildup of containers at the port. In addition
to improving port information sharing and restoring fairness to the
financial incentives for moving cargo, there is a critical need to
incentivize better chassis management and to secure more chassis and
equipment to move more containers at ports.
Pass the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2021 (H.R.4996)
The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) has extensively studied the
issue of unjust and unreasonable practices relating to detention and
demurrage charges levied on motor carriers and shippers by ocean
carriers and marine terminal operators. Last year the FMC issued an
Interpretive Rule on detention and demurrage that outlined how these
charges should be used to help properly incentivize the efficient
movement of freight. Unfortunately, the rule has not brought the
changes that were intended and motor carriers working at ports still
receive bills for detention and demurrage that can be in violation of
the regulation. These companies are all too often then forced to spend
time and resources protesting these unfair penalties. If these protests
are unsuccessful, then they must weigh the risks of pursuing litigation
or arbitration with large, global shipping lines to recover their
losses.
Due to consolidation, there are now fewer than a dozen major
steamship lines, and those that are remaining have organized into three
alliances, shrinking the marketplace even further. For truckers and
shippers who must do business with the ocean carriers to transport
freight, there often is little recourse when they believe they have
been treated unfairly on detention and demurrage, chassis charges, or a
host of other issues.
ATA is pleased to support the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2021,
introduced earlier this year by Representatives John Garamendi (D-CA)
and Dusty Johnson (R-SD) to end these unfair practices and ensure that
all parties are properly focused on the efficient movement of freight.
The legislation would require ocean shippers to certify that all
detention and demurrage charges comply with the FMC regulation and
place the burden of proof on the ocean carriers. Importantly for
truckers who do not contract with the ocean carriers but are the ones
who receive these bills, it would also require FMC to examine whether
these charges should be billed to any party other than the shipper. The
consolidation we have seen in recent years means that the maritime
marketplace has changed significantly, and it is time that the law was
updated to reflect this. We urge the Committee to take up this
legislation as soon as possible.
Equipment Availability
There is virtually zero availability of chassis, which is a
critical chokepoint for U.S. ports at this time. Trucking companies and
intermodal equipment providers that purchase this equipment rely on
both domestic and foreign suppliers. Recent trade actions, including
Section 301 tariffs imposed during the Trump Administration and an
antidumping and countervailing duty ruling from the Department of
Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) earlier
this year, limit chassis availability from global sources. ATA is
concerned that the combination of the tariffs and duties only increases
the cost of chassis without providing a sizeable increase in domestic
production to meet the demands of the U.S. intermodal marketplace.
Without increased chassis availability, motor carriers will continue to
struggle to meet consumer demand in an efficient and timely manner.
A lack of interoperability for chassis in certain locations further
strains the motor carriers and shippers moving products through our
ports. Many ocean carriers require motor carriers to use chassis from
their preferred intermodal equipment provider in order to pick up a
container from that shipping line. This is true even for merchant
haulage where the shipper contracts directly with the motor carrier for
land transportation rather than with the ocean carrier. This could
require a motor carrier to return one chassis and pick up another one
just to pick up a container from a specific ocean shipping line. This
inefficient system that allows ocean carriers to sideline competition
also prevents motor carriers from choosing their own chassis provider,
adding time and expense that is eventually passed on to consumers.
Finally, the supply chain challenges that make it harder to move
freight efficiently are compounded by the inability to receive new
trucks and the necessary parts to maintain fleets. These shortages are
making it harder to keep trucks on the road and placing the economy at
risk of an even greater capacity shortage. Semiconductor shortages are
slowing delivery of new equipment because OEMs are being forced to idle
plants as they wait to build up sufficient stock to produce trucks.
Fleets are cannibalizing older equipment to keep their assets moving as
best they can. These shortages will continue to challenge those
companies working in the supply chain, and we encourage the members of
this Committee to consider these industry concerns.
4) Vaccine Mandate
Supply chain issues are not just the result of inefficiencies at
ports, failing infrastructure throughout the nation, and regulations
standing in the way of progress, but also the result of unintended
consequences from unwise policy decisions. As we made clear in our
comments [https://ata.msgfocus.com/c/1UbQ1tbTx1oURLRQe6lyDbjMy] to the
Administration on the OSHA vaccine or testing mandate, while ATA has
promoted voluntary vaccinations amongst the trucking industry, we are
adamantly opposed to misguided mandates on the trucking workforce.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) COVID-19
Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) specifically exempts employees who
exclusively work outdoors or remotely and have minimal contact with
others indoors. And as you know, commercial truck drivers spend the
vast majority of their workday alone in the cab and outside. All
indications thus far from the Department of Labor suggest this
exemption applies to the commercial truck driver population. We are
also thankful that OSHA stated in its rule that employers who are both
government contractors subject to a separate requirement under
contracting provisions will not also have to meet the requirements of
the OSHA rule.
While we are pleased the rule exempts a large part of the trucking
industry and doesn't overlay with the federal contractor requirements,
it does not, however, take into account that trucking is not a one-
size-fits-all industry, and we continue to believe OSHA is using
extraordinary authority unwisely, applying it across all industries at
an arbitrary threshold of 100 employees that fails to factor in actual
risks.
As mentioned above, there are labor shortages causing
inefficiencies at ports, inland warehouses, and distribution
facilities. America's trucking industry is built on a deregulated model
with hundreds of thousands of licensed motor carriers of all shapes and
sizes. Setting an arbitrary threshold for vaccine mandates based on
company size puts the companies above that threshold at a disadvantage
where their drivers and workers can simply leave for jobs at companies
where they will not be subject to a mandate. Trucking workforce data
gathered by ATA indicates that an employer-based vaccination mandate
based on the arbitrary threshold of 100 employees could mean the loss
of up to 37% of drivers for covered companies to retirements, attrition
to smaller carriers, or conversion to independent contractor owner-
operators. Federal regulations should not play favorites among
competitive industries, but this proposal does exactly that.
ATA strongly supports efforts to provide access to vaccination and
COVID-19 testing broadly throughout the country. To that end our
members working in the supply chain play a major role in ensuring
distribution of vaccines and medicines nationwide. More broadly,
truckers ensure that institutions and families across the country have
access to necessities--milk, eggs, bread, produce, fuel, and the COVID-
19 vaccine itself--despite the ongoing challenges to daily life.
Truckers in fleets of all sizes play a role in meeting that demand and
transporting the goods we all need.
While this Committee considers ways to support resiliency in our
nation's supply chains, ATA requests that members be aware of the
following necessary provisions that ATA explained to the Administration
should have also been included to protect the supply chain:
(1)  A specific written exemption for truck drivers akin to that
provided by Canada for its drivers or alternatively deferring coverage
of truck drivers under a vaccine or testing protocol to the traditional
regulating agency with transportation expertise--the Federal Motor
Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)--rather than OSHA; and
(2)  A reasonable implementation timeline of not less than 90 days.

Without these two changes at least, there is almost no way that the
vaccine mandate doesn't further deteriorate our supply chain situation.
This mandate is wholly unnecessary based on our data also. While much
of the country was sequestered in their homes over the past eighteen
months, the trucking industry served its essential function, and did so
successfully with safety standards developed by public health experts.
In fact, ATA surveyed its members and provided data to the
Administration showing that our drivers were well below the infection
and mortality rates of the general population. We support the
Administration's goals of increased vaccination rates and clear health
guidelines to enhance protections for all Americans. We have urged
trucking industry employees to get vaccinated and will continue to do
so. We will also continue to work with federal authorities to increase
voluntary vaccination rates for our sector.
Unfortunately, however, the OSHA rule together with the federal
contractor vaccination mandate, will have significant unintended
consequences. Because the rule does not take into account the effects
on the trucking industry, ATA has been forced to take action against
the ETS to protect the industry. Because of its one-size-fits-all
approach and short implementation timeline as well as logistical
impossibility of administering testing on our incredibly mobile
workforce, the rule inherently fails to balance the risks of a single
standard for all industries against the broad impact that such a rule
will have in exacerbating challenges to the supply chain and economy.
Even if the ultimate goal is something we all agree on--increasing
vaccination protections and defeating the COVID-19 pandemic--it is
vital that public health measures first do no harm. This one will make
the supply chain difficulties worse if it is not revisited
substantially and that is why ATA felt compelled to bring a legal
challenge in spite of our overall support for the Administration's
goals.
Conclusion:
Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and Members of the
Committee, thank you again for the opportunity to testify before the
Committee at a moment when the challenges facing our nation's supply
chains are significant and complex. The members of the American
Trucking Associations are working ceaselessly to move goods across this
country, and I appreciate the opportunity to present you with insights
on steps that can be taken to meet those challenges help improve the
nation's movement of goods.
The entire ATA federation stands ready to work hand-in-hand with
Congress and the Biden Administration to address the issues we are
discussing today. Thank you.

Mr. DeFazio. I thank the gentleman for his strong
statement.
Now to Mr. Jefferies, Ian Jefferies.
Mr. Jefferies. Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves,
members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to be
here today representing America's freight railroads.
While the past 2 years have been extremely challenging for
all of us, I am immensely proud of the continued resolve of
railroads, and their constant movement of goods, and doing it
in a safe manner throughout the pandemic. It is a testament to
our employees' commitment and dedication, and a result of
sustained private investment, which has resulted in railroads
having the highest rated infrastructure in the country,
according to the American Society of Civil Engineers.
Speaking of investment, our industry applauds the passage
of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a historic
downpayment on the Nation's future that will make critical
investments and pay dividends for years to come. Railroads are
especially appreciative of the $845 million per year for
highway-rail grade crossing safety and elimination projects,
along with commonsense improvements to the Federal permitting
process to increase timeliness and predictability for getting
projects approved and money put to work.
If I can leave you with one point today, though, it is
this: the Nation's railroads have been, are, and will continue
to operate 24/7. Day and night, we are moving carload traffic,
bulk freight, and intermodal containers throughout the country,
collaborating with all of our supply chain partners to deliver
the goods customers and communities rely on.
Over the past 1\1/2\ years, railroads have taken several
steps to keep goods moving and maximize fluidity, particularly
in intermodal terminals. These facilities were never intended
to be used for storage, so it is a top priority to maintain
fluidity and keep goods moving, not store them. For instance,
railroads have rerouted traffic away from congested hubs,
reopened dormant intermodal yards, and, where possible,
increased storage and capacity in existing yards to offload
more containers.
Railroads are also providing incentives to our trucking
partners to use off-peak hours and weekends for pickups to
maintain the flow of goods out of the yards. At the local
level, railroads are bypassing constrained local truck
movements by interchanging goods directly between railroads,
shifting from rubber tire interchange to steel wheel
interchange to alleviate crosstown drayage.
On the employment side, while properly sourced for demand
in some regions, railroads are also hiring across crafts and
other markets, where appropriate.
In short, railroads are pulling multiple levers to maintain
fluidity. In the first 6 months of 2021, railroads moved more
intermodal containers than they had in any other 6-month period
in their history. Even today, railroads have capacity, and are
open to taking on additional business, especially in the
international intermodal space.
Yet, as we know full well, today's supply chain challenges
are multifaceted. Largely, this is the result of a fundamental
shift that has occurred in the economy since the onset of the
pandemic. While the services portion of the economy has
substantially dropped off, the goods portion of the economy has
dramatically increased.
And beyond the unprecedented change in demand, well-
documented labor shortages in critical segments of the supply
chain, including trucking, warehousing, and other industries, a
lack of available chassis, and extremely limited warehouse
space--3.6 percent vacancy rate in warehouses, nationwide--has
hampered the integrated supply chain, and delayed on-time
deliveries.
Recent steps taken by partners in the supply chain, such as
the mentioned shift to 24/7 operations at the Ports of L.A. and
Long Beach, and the activity at the Port of Savannah, as well,
to increase throughput and capacity, are all encouraging steps.
But I think it is clear there are no quick fixes, and we in the
supply chain are all in this together until the challenge is
met and overcome.
From the policy perspective, lawmakers and regulators
should be focused on how to safely maximize goods movement and
meet demand today and into the future. This starts with
encouraging innovation and deployment of safety and capacity-
enhancing technologies. We must make the most efficient use of
the infrastructure we have, while also expanding where
possible.
In the rail space, one example is automated track
inspection, a data-driven technology that allows for more track
to be inspected, while keeping lines open. The result? A higher
level of safety, while no loss to fluidity. We should continue
to look for innovative ideas like this to make the most of our
infrastructure.
Policymakers would also be wise to reject efforts to
mandate forced access, or competitive switching, as some call
it, at the Surface Transportation Board, which would only add
complexity and slow down goods movement. Thank you to the 90-
plus Members of the House who wrote in opposition of this
recently. The last thing we should be doing right now is
knowingly enacting policies that will gum up the works and
adversely affect fluidity.
Now, in closing, while our Nation is currently facing
complex challenges, freight railroads will continue to work
with our partners to keep goods moving today and into the
future.
Thank you for the efforts across the industries represented
today, and thank you for the efforts of our employees
throughout the pandemic. Without them, the economies, frankly,
would not have continued to function. Thank you, and I am happy
to answer any questions you might have.
[Mr. Jefferies' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Ian Jefferies, President and Chief Executive
Officer, Association of American Railroads
Introduction
On behalf of the members of the Association of American Railroads
(AAR), thank you for the opportunity to testify. AAR's members account
for the vast majority of America's freight railroad mileage, employees,
revenue, and traffic. Together with their Mexican and Canadian
counterparts, U.S. freight railroads form an integrated, continent-wide
network that provides the world's best rail service.
Freight supply chains are complex systems driven by global and
domestic stakeholders. While their operations are constantly facing
pressures, unprecedented events have arisen in the past 18 months that
have led to significant supply chain dislocations. America's freight
railroads are doing their part though--through significant investments
in their private infrastructure and equipment, development and
implementation of innovative technologies, cooperation with their
customers and supply chain partners, and operational enhancements--to
maintain network fluidity and ensure sufficient capacity to deliver the
goods upon which our economy depends.
Railroads' Role in Supply Chains
An international freight shipment involves railroads and other
stakeholders taking timely, appropriate actions to keep the system
working in a precisely coordinated sequence. Railroads provide a 24/7
critical link in that supply chain, serving as the middle mover from
the port to a rail terminal, with our partners in the trucking,
warehouse, and port communities at either end.
For example, movement of a container from a manufacturer in Asia to
a retailer in the eastern United States will require the efforts of
numerous entities, such as steamship lines; truckers; railroads; ports;
drayage providers; owners of truck chassis, shipping containers, and
warehouses; as well as manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers of
goods. A railroad's role in this supply chain begins after the
manufacturer delivers the container to a port in Asia, a 3- to 5-week
trip across the Pacific Ocean on a steamship occurs, and the container
is unloaded at a West Coast port and made available for pickup.
Railroads then begin the movement of this freight in one of three
ways: loading the container onto a railcar at the port; loading the
container onto a railcar at a nearby intermodal rail facility after it
has been moved there on a chassis via short-distance truck
transportation (drayage); or loading the container onto a railcar at an
intermodal rail facility following transport by truck drayage to an
inland warehouse where the freight was transferred into a larger
``domestic container'' and then transported by truck drayage again to
that intermodal rail facility. The train carrying the container then
heads inland. As no single railroad stretches across the country, the
container must be ``interchanged'' with a second railroad. This
exchange could also include another truck drayage between the terminals
of those respective railroads.
The rail journey then concludes at a rail intermodal terminal on
the East Coast near the container's final destination where it is
lifted off its railcar and either placed directly onto a chassis or on
the ground depending on the terminal design and operation (wheeled or
grounded). Railroads provide some ``free time'' to store the container
at the intermodal terminal while awaiting pick-up and transportation to
a nearby warehouse or directly to a retail outlet for unloading. In
normal times, the container is moved out of the intermodal terminal
within a matter of hours to a few days. Once transferred to its final
destination and unloaded, the empty container is picked up again by
drayage trucks and generally either returned to a rail intermodal
facility or to a nearby port, where it re-enters the supply chain.
Global Supply Chains Have Seen Huge Dislocations Over the Past 18
Months
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global manufacturing
capabilities and caused major fluctuations in consumer consumption
patterns. At the outset of the pandemic in March and April 2020,
consumer spending plummeted, and retailers' inventories rose sharply.
Soon thereafter the economy recovered, but consumer spending had
shifted significantly, resulting in increased demand for goods while
service-sector industries--e.g., travel, restaurants--suffered
enormously. By June 2020, consumer spending on goods was higher than in
January 2020 (Figure 1) and continued trending higher. Few firms saw
these spending patterns coming; even fewer were prepared for them.
Retailers tried, but were unable, to catch up. In fact, by spring 2021,
inventories had fallen to record lows, which they remain close to today
(Figure 2).

Figure 1

Figure 2
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Similarly, rail intermodal volumes fell between 12 and 17 percent
on a year-over-year basis between March and May 2020, and volumes were
expected to remain low for months. Instead, intermodal volumes rose
sharply in the summer of 2020, surpassing 2019 levels by August and
breaking the all-time monthly record for intermodal traffic in November
2020. That record was then broken again in January and April 2021
(Figure 3). In many weeks in late 2020 and the first half of 2021, U.S.
railroads were handling close to 300,000 containers and trailers,
levels that no one expected when the pandemic began. Intermodal volume
in the first six months of 2021 was far higher than ever recorded
before for the same period, and the rail industry saw a year-over-year
increase in intermodal traffic for 12 months.

Figure 3
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Roughly half of rail intermodal volume is either imports or
exports, and these significant gains in intermodal volumes were
paralleled at our nation's ports. To handle these increased volumes and
avoid bottlenecks, all stakeholders needed to do their part to maintain
a safe, efficient flow of freight. However, when that has not happened
in recent months, such as when goods suppliers and receivers make
decisions to overextend their capacity by ordering additional freight
when warehouses are full or they lack sufficient labor to handle such
goods, the supply chain has become dislocated. Some examples of
continuing challenges experienced by rail customers and other supply
chain participants include:

Labor shortages at ports, trucking firms, warehouses,
manufacturers, and retailers;

A shortage of drayage and long-haul truck capacity,
chassis, and warehouse space; and

Container and container ship availability concerns that
are driving firms to purchase large quantities of goods that may not
actually be needed for months.

Additionally, some events have occurred that have exacerbated
pandemic-related challenges to the functioning of supply chains, such
as:

Pre-existing trade disputes with other nations;

Extreme weather events, including wildfires, hurricanes,
and severe flooding and storms; and

A nearly week-long blockage of the Suez Canal in March
2021.
Impacts of Supply Chains Dislocations on the Rail Industry
For railroads, by far the single most problematic supply chain
development in recent months has been the inability of many rail
customers to effectively process the flow of traffic--especially
intermodal containers--into and out of rail terminals. For example,
when a container arrives at a destination rail terminal, it cannot be
picked up unless a driver, drayage truck, and chassis are available and
a destination warehouse or receiver facility has workers and space.
Often appointment times are needed at these warehouses or receiver
facilities, and if the driver, chassis, and drayage cannot meet that
appointment time, it could take days to arrange another. As a result,
containers are remaining at rail facilities for longer periods--
referred to as ``container dwell.''
That is a significant problem because rail intermodal terminals are
focused on throughput and are neither designed for, nor physically
capable of, long-term storage of significant numbers of containers.
There is some flex within the rail system to absorb and accommodate
limited spikes and volatility, but the recent massive imbalances are
not sustainable and create severe problems that reverberate throughout
the supply chain. For example, traffic on rail mainlines backs up
because there is no room at rail terminals for new shipments. This
limits the ability of railroads to serve their customers and supplies
of containers and chassis then become imbalanced because they are not
being moved to high demand areas. Moreover, the physical act of moving
containers within a terminal requires railroads to expend resources
that would be much better used moving goods to their destination. When
these and other related problems become entrenched, as they are today,
it becomes extraordinarily difficult to ``reset'' the system to its
normal level of throughput and reliability.
Railroads' Efforts to Address Challenges and Work with Supply Chain
Partners
Railroads have worked diligently to ensure that supply chains
remain fluid and that they are able to meet present and future freight
transportation demand. First, railroads have and will continue to
operate 24 hours per day and 7 days per week and would welcome freight
transportation customers and other supply chain partners to do the
same. Substantial supply chain capacity could be generated immediately
from this change, and this would permit transportation providers to
``catch up'' when backups occur. Railroads appreciate that some supply
chain participants have recently taken steps in this direction.
Second, railroads are partnering with their customers to find
constructive ways to modify their operations and maintain network
fluidity. Some of these changes, where possible, include:

Increasing coordination between railroads to better
manage the flow of traffic and with the trucking industry to take
shipments as soon as warehousing capacity is available;

Offering incentives to customers for weekend or off-hour
in-gating at facilities near ports and for out-gating a container when
they in-gate a container at other facilities;

Re-routing traffic away from busier terminals to less
crowded terminals;

Reopening closed terminals to create additional storage
capacity;

Increasing available storage capacity and staging space
in and outside of terminals;

Creating additional railroad-to-railroad interchanges to
limit demand on truck drayage; and

Mounting containers onto any chassis brought in to help
reduce dead-miles for truckers.

Third, railroads typically make available a variety of online
tools, apps, and other technologies that provide their customers with
full visibility regarding a shipment's journey over rail networks. This
allows for customers to trace shipments in real time, more efficiently
prioritize retrieval of containers, and minimize time spent in rail
facilities.
Fourth, railroads can incentivize customers to pick up freight in a
timely manner through charging progressively higher storage fees after
a reasonable initial period of ``free time.'' These fees help railroads
maintain service reliability, efficient use of rail capacity and
assets, and fluidity on the rail network. And ultimately storage fees
function to ensure railroads can do what they are in business to do--
move goods.
Fifth, AAR publicly releases aggregated data on a weekly basis
about the commodities and intermodal volume that move by rail
throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This publication
includes detailed information at the commodity level, offers year-over-
year comparisons for weekly, monthly, and year-to-date durations, and
provides needed insight into ongoing rail traffic levels for supply
chain partners, rail customers, and governmental entities.
Sixth, freight railroads have invested more than $740 billion of
private capital since 1980--an average of over $25 billion in recent
years--into their infrastructure and equipment to make rail operations
safer, more resilient, and more efficient. The American Society of
Civil Engineers has recognized the impact of these investments by
awarding the rail network its highest grade for any type of
infrastructure in its last two report cards.
Finally, railroads rely on and greatly respect the skill and
professionalism of their employees as they steadfastly work to address
today's supply chain challenges and keep our economy moving. Railroads
are confident that they have the right assets and headcount to manage
the network at current and increased traffic levels and are hiring to
address attrition and meet needed operational capacity. As is the case
with other industries, it can be challenging today to fill open
positions, but members are working hard to meet those needs.
Railroads will continue to evaluate business needs and adjust asset
levels to ensure there is sufficient capacity to serve their customers
and keep supply chains moving. In fact, a report recently released by
the Northwestern University Transportation Center found that railroads
showed significant agility to respond during rises in intermodal
traffic throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, due to recent
lower intermodal volumes, railroads currently have additional capacity
to meet any short-term increases or shifts in demand for freight
transportation and stand ready to serve their customers.
How Congress Can Be Helpful in Alleviating Supply Chain Challenges
Congress should encourage the use of innovative technologies to
enhance safety and operational efficiency and focus on performance-
based policies that are supported by evidence. Most importantly,
policymakers should avoid undermining railroads' ongoing efforts and
collaboration with stakeholders to keep the national rail network
fluid, especially when supply chains are already facing severe
challenges. Discussed below are several legislative and regulatory
proposals that could impact the functionality of our nation's supply
chains.
H.R. 3684, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)
Railroads thank Congress for enacting IIJA. This bipartisan
legislation will modernize the nation's public infrastructure and
further the efficiency of our freight transportation systems and supply
chains. By authorizing and making significant investments through the
Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA), Rebuilding American
Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE), Port
Infrastructure Development, Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety
Improvements (CRISI), and Railroad Crossing Elimination grant programs,
projects will be constructed that increase the fluidity of our supply
chains, such as improving first and last mile intermodal connections;
advancing projects of national and regional significance, including
multimodal connection infrastructure projects; and enabling the public
sector to partner with industry on mutually beneficial projects, such
as the CREATE program in Chicago.
Surface Transportation Board (STB), ``Forced Switching,'' and Cost-
Benefit Analysis
Congress should ensure that the STB maintains the balanced economic
regulatory system set forth in the Staggers Act. If the STB were
permitted to unwisely expand rail regulation, the quality of rail
service would be diminished and the efficiency of the entire supply
chain would suffer.
One problematic proposal being considered by the STB is ``forced
switching,'' which would allow the STB to order one railroad to switch
traffic with another railroad even without a finding of anti-
competitive conduct. As this proposal would force one railroad to
provide its infrastructure and other assets for the benefit of another
railroad, this would create a disincentive to make new investments in
customer-specific infrastructure. Additionally, as switches can add
time and complexity to rail movements, the STB's proposal would disrupt
traffic patterns, potentially produce congestion in rail yards, and
undermine efficient rail service. While there is no good time for bad
regulations, now is the worst time to introduce inefficiencies into the
supply chain.
Congress should instead direct the STB to institute a rulemaking
based upon AAR's petition to incorporate cost-benefit analysis into its
rulemaking processes. Meaningful cost-benefit analysis requires
agencies to be informed by the most up-to-date, reliable information
and to evaluate whether additional rules will achieve positive outcomes
and at what cost prior to adopting new regulations. A formal cost-
benefit analysis would ensure future supply chain fluidity, as impacts
on the supply chain would be formally accounted for when the STB
considers new regulations.
Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Automated Track Inspection, and
Two-Person Crews
Railroads urge Congress to direct the FRA and other modal
administrations at the Department of Transportation (DOT) to be more
forward-looking in their rulemaking processes and approaches to the
development, testing, and incorporation of new safety technologies.
Achieving maximum benefits from new technologies will require a modern
performance-based regulatory framework that does not hinder innovation,
encourages railroads to keep investing in new technologies, and
maintains FRA oversight to ensure the protection of rail employees,
customers, and the public at large.
As part of these efforts, Congress should ensure that FRA
regulations do not ``lock in'' existing technologies and processes and
stifle the incorporation of new safety technologies. A current
problematic example of this at the FRA is with automated track
inspections (ATI), which are conducted using track geometry technology
installed in freight cars or on locomotives that move at-speed in
revenue service and without the need to set-aside track time to conduct
visual inspections. These automated systems gather massive amounts of
data and analyze it for patterns and warning signs, empowering a shift
from reactive to preventative track maintenance. During testing, ATI
has overwhelmingly shown its safety benefits. Indeed, in some
instances, ATI testing of track has resulted in more than a 90 percent
reduction in unprotected main track defects. Congress should ensure
that the FRA remains a cooperative partner with railroads in either
encouraging the further testing of ATI through timely review and
approval of waivers and test programs or taking steps to further enable
the use of this safety technology, such as by updating half-century-old
track inspection regulations. Either way supply chains will benefit
from the efficiency gains.
Additionally, Congress should ensure the FRA uses current data to
establish the need for any new regulation and validates that safety
benefits exceed the cost of its implementation. A problematic proposal
being considered by the FRA is a requirement that a minimum of two crew
members operate in freight locomotive cabs indefinitely. There are no
data showing that a two-person crew mandate would enhance safety.
Moreover, this mandate could stifle the adoption of new technologies
that would enhance the safety and efficiency of the rail network in the
long-term. In opposing this rule, railroads are not seeking the ability
to utilize one-person crews haphazardly, but rather they want to work
with rail labor under the existing collective bargaining framework--as
they have for decades--to identify when conditions would allow for a
reduction in the number of crewmembers without jeopardizing safety.
Environmental Reviews and Permitting
Congress should ensure that environmental regulations do not
function to inhibit the expansion, development, or construction of rail
facilities that would meet supply chain needs and our customers'
freight transportation demand. A primary example is the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Federal agencies should promulgate
regulations that allow for careful, thorough consideration of the
environmental impacts of proposed projects but in a time-limited manner
that does not cause unnecessary delay. Such an approach would expedite
projects that enhance supply chain fluidity but would not prevent
comprehensive, effective environmental reviews from taking place.
Additionally, DOT should ensure that its modal administrations are
applying environmental review standards and procedures consistently to
ensure equal treatment between the various modes of transportation.
Moreover, DOT could more efficiently utilize categorical exclusions
which would ensure federal resources are better focused on those
actions requiring an Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact
Statements. Further, expressly allowing modal administrations to apply
the categorical exclusions of other modal administrations or federal
agencies would promote flexibility and efficiency in the environmental
review process and consistency within DOT.
Railroads appreciate that Congress included project permitting
provisions in IIJA, such as One Federal Decision, which consolidates
decision-making and expedites deadlines, and the Federal Permitting
Reform and Jobs Act, which makes the Federal Permitting Improvement
Steering Council permanent and establishes a goal of two years for
reviews. These provisions will ensure that federal dollars and
railroads' private investments for infrastructure projects will go
farther and that the construction of projects on the rail network to
enhance supply chain efficiency and meet the nation's current and
future freight transportation demand will not be unnecessarily delayed.
Conclusion
Returning fluidity to rail networks will take time and require
enhanced cooperation by all parties to determine which actions are
needed to improve supply chain performance. This is not a new way of
operating for railroads; they work closely with their customers,
transportation partners, policymakers, and others on an ongoing basis
to understand and meet expected service needs. Railroads will continue
to work with these entities to find ways to solve these problems as
quickly as possible.

Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Mr. Jefferies, a very succinct
statement.
Ms. Reinke?
Ms. Reinke. Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and
members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee, thank you for inviting me to speak with you today
regarding disruptions in the supply chain. My name is Anne
Reinke, I am the president and CEO of the Transportation
Intermediaries Association, or TIA.
I am honored to be here today to represent our more than
1,800 member companies. Our members act as the central
connection between the shipper and the carrier, matching the
shipper's freight with a carrier who will ultimately move the
product, regardless of mode.
From our members' perspective, today's supply chain
disruptions are the result of a perfect storm caused by a host
of issues that have resulted in the gridlock we are
experiencing. On the supply side, there are shortages in almost
every link of the chain, from labor to equipment to warehousing
space. And on the demand side, freight is moving about 11
percent higher than the already elevated normal, or more than
50 percent greater than the previous peak in 2005. Capacity
simply cannot be added as fast to keep up.
The chairman mentioned the three D's. I think the solution
results in the three I's: investment, innovation, and
interaction among stakeholders in the supply chain. We think
the Government can incentivize investment in efficiency. And
for industry, we think that they can prioritize forging
relationships and deploying innovative technologies to amplify
capacity.
Supply chain stakeholders have been working for decades to
increase its overall efficiency to meet public demands, as e-
commerce has proliferated. These just-in-time delivery efforts
produce significant efficiencies and worked extremely well in a
relatively stable economy. However, efficiencies can also
result in a lack of slack in the system. When there is a
significant event like a global pandemic that disrupts the
normal flow of goods, those freight networks have little slack
and, therefore, limited ability to adjust to market conditions.
That is what we face today.
There is no single silver bullet to cure all the supply
chain challenges. However, there are several ways to help the
movement of goods that could yield benefits over time.
First, while we are in an unprecedented era, it is critical
to understand that the market can and will adjust, but it does
take time. One way to handle this is for shippers to rely more
heavily on brokers, as they exist to provide more flexibility
through their relationships and technology. Brokers can be
capacity amplifiers.
Second, wherever possible, infrastructure funding should
support the supply chain. TIA applauds the Congress for the
passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the
historic investment in our Nation's transportation and
infrastructure projects and needs. In the long term, the
Federal Government can be a key partner in helping build a more
resilient supply chain, nationwide. Programs that support
freight, ports, and congestion reduction, like those in the
IIJA, will help to bolster safety and throughput, and address
our Nation's congested roads and aging bridges.
The private infrastructure investment of our world-class
freight railroads should also continue to be incentivized to
address the current surge in intermodal freight. As part of our
investment, we must focus on innovation. TIA members are
industry leaders in the technology space to keep up with an
ever-evolving and growing marketplace. These solutions include
maximum freight visibility with real-time data, automation in
the back-end office, and utilizing artificial intelligence.
3PLs are one segment of the supply chain, and we welcome
additional data or technology efforts from other sectors.
Third, the Government can examine existing or pending
regulations, and determine whether they encourage productivity
and access to workforce, or deter both. The AB5 law and
regulation, and the California Air Resources Board regulations
may be exacerbating the supply chain situation by narrowing the
pool of available drivers, equipment, and companies. TIA is
aware some of these laws in mind are not implemented yet, but
the effects to capacity are already being felt by brokers and
motor carriers.
States should balance their priorities with the need to
move freight safely and efficiently. That is why we are
concerned about the PRO Act and its nationwide implications. In
other words, the Government can encourage or inhibit investment
through its actions on grants and regulations.
Finally, TIA continues to push for a motor carrier safety
rating process that uses data, rather than an outdated and
underresourced physical audit system. This antiquated system
has led to the FMCSA rating only 10 percent of trucking
companies, with the other 90 percent being unrated,
compromising both safety and capacity. This untenable situation
can be fixed, however: H.R. 3042, the Motor Carrier Safety
Selection Standard Act of 2021, would promote a broader pool of
safe-rated motor carriers. TIA would urge the committee to move
this legislation forward as quickly as possible.
I appreciate the opportunity to testify before the
committee today to provide the perspective of the 3PL industry
and offer some potential solutions. I would be happy to answer
any questions.
[Ms. Reinke's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Anne Reinke, President and Chief Executive
Officer, Transportation Intermediaries Association
Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and members of the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, thank you for the
opportunity to speak with you today regarding concerns and disruptions
in the supply chain that directly impact the free-flowing movement of
freight in the U.S. and its impact on the American consumer. I
appreciate the opportunity to give the perspective of our members today
and provide some potential pragmatic solutions that could help
alleviate the disruptions.
My name is Anne Reinke; I am the President & CEO of the
Transportation Intermediaries Association (TIA). I am honored to be
here today to represent our more than 1,800 member companies. TIA is
the professional organization of the $214 billion third-party logistics
industry. Our members essentially serve as the central connection
between shipper and carrier, matching our shipper's (customer) freight
with the carrier who will ultimately move the product, regardless of
mode. TIA members utilize the latest technology to efficiently plan
global freight transportation across all modes, gain real-time
visibility of inventory-in-transit and proactively manage delays
specific to ocean/port and inland truck/rail capacity challenges.
Additionally, TIA members increase collaboration between all modes of
transportation and recognize the incredibly hard work and dedication
that trucking companies, railroads, ocean liners, and airlines play in
the supply chain. TIA is the largest organization exclusively
representing transportation intermediaries of all disciplines doing
business in domestic and international commerce.
Our members have a unique perspective and view into the supply
chain across all modes, because their entire goal is to help get goods
efficiently from one place to another. From our members' perspective,
the supply chain disruptions that we see today are the result of a
perfect storm. The supply chain crisis is not the cause of one or even
a small number of defined issues, but rather a host of issues that
resulted in the failures we are all experiencing. On the supply side,
irrespective of the mode of transportation, there is a labor shortage
in all areas of the supply chain (plant employees, drivers, train
operators and warehouse employees), a chip shortage, a lack of
available chassis, and a lack of warehouse and container storage. And
on the demand side, freight is moving at historic peaks, as the
pandemic spurred a focus on the goods economy in the absence of a
service economy. Capacity simply cannot be added as fast to keep up,
though we know all our partners in the supply chain are doing as much
as they can as fast as they can. We also have to remember that the
supply chain challenges are not confined to the U.S., it is a global
phenomenon.
Now more than ever, freight transportation intermediaries are the
vital point of connection between freight that needs to be hauled and
the trucking and rail operators that need to move it. There's no silver
bullet solution on the horizon, even with millions of dollars pouring
into transportation and logistics technology. Such technology is being
put to use in building new platforms and systems to try to solve the
cascading crises that have mounted over the past two years. Instead,
the keys to solving this ongoing supply chain crisis lie in having the
government incentivize investment and efficiency, and for industry
stakeholders to prioritize forging relationships and deploying
innovative technology. All industry stakeholders must find new avenues
for working together and making more efficient use of existing
capacity, equipment, labor, technology, and warehousing space.
To that end, TIA applauds the U.S. House of Representatives and the
U.S. Senate for the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act (IIJA) and the historic investment in our nation's transportation
and infrastructure projects and needs. Specifically, three provisions
relating to TIA membership, including a section that clarifies the role
of ``dispatch services'' in the supply chain, a full review of the
FMCSA Consumer Complaint Database, and a pilot program for 18- to 20-
year-old drivers. Importantly, the bill also includes a
transformational investment in funding and grants for infrastructure to
support ports and the freight network.
About TIA:
TIA members include more than 1,800 motor carrier property brokers,
surface freight forwarders, international ocean transportation
intermediaries (ocean freight forwarders and NVOCCs), air forwarders,
customs brokers, warehouse operators, logistics management companies,
and intermodal marketing companies. TIA members handle the purchase of
more than $100 billion worth of transportation each year and employ
more than 130,000 people across the country.
TIA is also the U.S. member of the International Federation of
Freight Forwarders Associations(FIATA), the worldwide trade association
of transportation intermediaries representing approximately 50,000
companies in virtually every trading country.
Transportation intermediaries or third-party logistics
professionals act somewhat as the ``travel agents'' for freight;
however, given the wide varieties of freight, specific needs of each
shipper, and the diverse issues applicable to any one load means that
third-party logistics professionals must have expertise far beyond what
a traditional ``travel agent'' must possess. Using hard-won
relationships and advanced technologies, these companies serve tens of
thousands of shippers and carriers, bringing together the
transportation needs of the cargo interests with the corresponding
capacity and special equipment offered by rail, motor, air, and ocean
carriers.
Transportation intermediaries are companies whose expertise is
providing mode and carrier-neutral transportation arrangements for
shippers with specific needs and requirements and matching those with
the ability and expertise of the underlying operating carriers.
Supply Chain Crisis:
Stakeholders to the supply chain have been working for decades to
increase its overall efficiency as the public now expects consistency
and transparency in the delivery of products, or ``just in time
delivery'', due in large part to the e-commerce utilized by companies
like Amazon and consumer demand. This resulted in eliminating
``excess'' inventory, optimizing networks and transportation modes,
increasing labor productivity, and reducing overall labor costs. These
efforts produced significant supply chain efficiencies and worked
extremely well in a relatively stable economy and transportation
network.
However, efficiencies can also result in a lack of ``slack'' in the
system. When there is a significant event like a global pandemic that
disrupts the normal flow of goods, the supply chain networks have
little slack and therefore limited ability to adjust to market
conditions. All resources (trucks, rail assets, labor, and
infrastructure) are already assigned to the normal network and shifting
them in a different direction takes time. Historically, we have seen
these kinds of market dislocations in 2014 with the polar vortex in the
Midwest and during various hurricane seasons. However, the global
nature and sheer magnitude of the COVID-19 global pandemic has
exacerbated this issue to its breaking point.
Furthermore, the demand for freight takes this disruption to
another level. Generally, after minor events, the demand grows for
freight, but not at this rate. At its peak after the opening of the
economy, the demand for freight was 11% higher or more than 50% greater
than the previous peak in 2005. The costs to move freight throughout
the supply chain is drastically on the rise because of these
disruptions, which directly impact everyone throughout the supply chain
and ultimately the end consumers. We are seeing this firsthand as
prices jumped 6.2% in October, which is the biggest inflation surge in
more than 30 years.
There are certainly several key factors causing challenges--a lack
of truck drivers and other critical workforce, a lack of equipment
availability (chassis) due to shortages and increased dwell time, and
delays in permitted facilities that provide necessary warehousing
space. It is important to remember that all these issues are only part
of the links in a complex supply chain and have been affected by a
variety of reasons.
Potential Solutions:
While there is no single solution or action that will immediately
alleviate the supply chain disruption there are several issues that
could be addressed that would help the movement of goods. First, while
we are in unprecedented times, it's critical to understand that the
market can and will adjust, but it takes time. There are some ways that
the government can help to expedite the process in the short and long
term, but I would caution any significant government intervention that
could have the perverse outcome of slowing the market response. One way
to handle this is for shippers to rely more heavily on the spot market
and brokers, as they exist to provide more flexibility in the supply
chain for situations like these. Brokers can use their technology and
relationships to find critical capacity for shippers, when the demand
for freight movements exceed the freight moving under contract. Our
members are reporting that the request for brokers is more than twice
the amount than normal. Our members stand ready to assist in any way
possible to alleviate the crisis.
An immediate way that the government can help the supply chain is
to help free up productivity and access to the markets, as well as
support access to drivers. For example, there are current state laws
that could further impede the efficient movement of goods and should be
rolled back or suspended during this crisis. Some TIA members doing
business in California are concerned that the AB 5 law, which
essentially bars independent contractors from operating in the state,
will further exacerbate the supply chain situation by narrowing the
pool of available drivers and companies. For example, at the ports
themselves, the majority of dray carriers operating at the ports are
independent contractors. TIA is aware that the law is working its way
through the legal system and is currently under a legal stay until the
Supreme Court decides its fate, but the effects to the capacity can
already be felt by brokers and motor carriers. This California law
attacks the independent contractor model and is upsetting a highly
fluid and competitive marketplace and inhibiting to every available
company and driver. When almost 90% of all trucking companies are small
fleets of fewer than five trucks and the economy is in the middle of a
crisis, this law seems short sighted and imprudent. As a side note,
many of these fleets in addition to the larger ones were willing and
ready to enter the worst hot zones of the pandemic to ensure that
essential goods were delivered.
TIA supports all trucking companies and works tirelessly through
our Association and members to ensure that the conditions of truck
drivers continue to improve and create a win-win-win value proposition
for all parties involved. A diversified and decentralized freight
system that can adapt to market changes rapidly is the key to our
economic health, growth and national security. You can look at the
Colonial Pipeline data breach, if only 100 motor carriers existed in
the supply chain one hack could severely impair our supply chain. With
nearly 300,000 for-hire trucking companies with an average size of five
or fewer trucks, redundancies are built in the system. The PRO Act,
which would change the way independent contractors are classified at
the federal level would make this a national issue and have devastating
effects on the transportation market.
In the same vein, certain state environmental regulations are also
acting as a chokehold to port access. Let me be clear, TIA is a firm
believer in reducing the carbon footprint and becoming a green
industry. TIA works closely with the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) SmartWay program to incentivize our members to utilize clean
trucking companies, but regulations must be right-sized, discrete, and
not a deterrent to the efficient movement of freight. For example,
several of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) laws directly
impact the way our members conduct their business and capacity in the
State. Specifically, our members have to navigate CARB's Truck and Bus
Regulation, the Tractor-Trailer Greenhouse Gas Regulation, and the
Transport Refrigeration Unit Airborne Toxic Control Measure (TRU ATCM)
regulation. Additionally, there is a proposed regulation the Advanced
Clean Fleets regulation that seeks to achieve the goal of zero-emission
trucks and buses in the state of California by 2045 everywhere.
These regulations promulgated from CARB would hold our members
accountable for motor carrier emissions compliance for all freight
arranged in the State of California. The scope of the requirement is so
broad that it requires our members to check compliance of specific
trucks and is beyond the scope of how the industry works. These
regulations have led directly to several members not doing business in
the State anymore, and the same can be said for motor carriers as well,
who may not have the resources to install all these green technologies.
These regulations have led to a situation where a carrier may haul the
freight to the state line and refuse to enter the state, which in turn
requires another carrier to finish the load that is willing to operate
in the state of California. These regulations can be promulgated on
interstate commerce based on a federal waiver under the Clean Air Act
that was given to the State of California. In the long term, TIA would
implore Congress to remove this waiver, but in the short term, TIA
would urge the State of California and Governor Newsom to temporarily
suspend the AB 5 law and these environmental regulations to alleviate
the disruption.
Third, wherever possible infrastructure funding should support the
supply chain. This is an area where, long term, the federal government
can be a key partner in helping to build a more resilient supply chain
nationwide. The IIJA is an important investment in that endeavor. Key
programs to support freight, ports and congestion reduction will help
to bolster throughput. TIA also appreciates President Biden's recent
announcement to help unlock grant funding at the ports. This should be
true for the entire supply chain. While the pinch point is currently at
the ports, the supply chain must work fluidly at every point. Our
members must help move freight from point A to B and use all modes of
transportation to make that happen efficiently. Today, our nation's
outdated infrastructure system relies on congested roads and aging
bridges that have a direct impact on freight efficiently and safely
moving forward. We also have world class freight rail networks and
their private investment in their infrastructure should continue to be
incentivized, to help mitigate the current congestion in intermodal
lanes.
Third, we must focus on innovation. TIA members continue to be
industry leaders in the technology space as they must constantly
innovate to address an ever evolving and growing industry. For example,
our members utilize the latest technology to facilitate the movement of
freight from one point to another. These solutions include maximum
freight visibility with real-time data, automation in the back-end
office, and utilizing artificial intelligence. However, as one segment
of the supply chain network, there is only so much they can do.
Additional data or technology may be necessary across other sectors. We
are interested to learn more about the Administration's recent
announcement to focus on building a data framework to help move goods
more efficiently. This framework may be useful if it reflects the
actual nature of how freight is moved and where and how data is shared.
As the government considers this step, the 3PL industry should be an
integral part of that discussion.
Finally, TIA has been for many years concerned about the motor
carrier safety rating process and its effects on the marketplace,
capacity and most importantly safety. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration (FMCSA) is still using an outdated physical audit system
to rate motor carriers for safety. This antiquated system has led to
90% of trucking companies being ``unrated.'' This system creates
confusion and conflicting information in the carrier selection and
vetting process that leads directly to a backlog and time constraints
on our member's operations. This lack of clarity is causing several
thousand small motor carriers from being utilized and ultimately
decreases the capacity of available trucking companies to our members.
TIA members and the industry need a new system that is built on fair
and reliable data which will expedite the process of selecting a motor
carrier and give industry stakeholders like ours more certainty on the
carriers they utilize and ensure that only the safest carriers are
selected.
TIA has fully endorsed and supported H.R. 3042. The ``Motor Carrier
Safety Selection Standard Act of 2021,'' sponsored by Congressman
Moulton (D-6th/MA) and Congressman Gallagher (R-8th/WI). H.R. 3042
would ask the FMCSA to begin the process of developing a new Safety
Fitness Determination (SFD) process to change the way carriers are
rated. TIA applauds Congressmen Moulton and Gallagher for their
leadership on this legislation and would ask the Committee to markup
this legislation as soon as possible to move it forward.
Conclusion:
I appreciate the opportunity to testify before the Committee today
to provide the perspective of the 3PL industry and offer some potential
solutions. I would be happy to answer any questions.

Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Ms. Reinke, 4:59, right on point
there, thank you.
Dr. Correll?
Mr. Correll. Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and
all the members of this committee, thank you for convening this
important session, and thank you for including me in it.
My name is David Correll. I am a research scientist and
lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center
for Transportation and Logistics, where I study the working
conditions, the quality of life, and the utilization of
American truckdrivers.
So far, my teams and I have analyzed the working hours and
pickup and delivery experiences of around 4,000 American over-
the-road truckdrivers in snapshots from 2016 to 2020. We have
also analyzed thousands of freight pickup and delivery
appointments using data provided to us by shipper and broker
companies, and we supplement this analysis with frequent
conversations with truckdrivers, their management, as well as
the shippers and the receivers who hire these drivers'
services.
The observations that I want to bring to into this
committee's conversation are, one, that my analysis suggests
that the existing population of American long-haul truckdrivers
are seriously underutilized, and have been so since at least
2016, when the data shared with me begins; two, that this
chronic underutilization problem does not seem to be a function
of what the drivers themselves do or don't do, but rather an
unfortunate consequence of our conventions for scheduling and
processing their pickup and delivery appointments; and three,
that large, new datasets like the ones I have been fortunate
enough to analyze, ones that cross firm boundaries, are
critical when coming up with solutions for improving our
American supply chains.
Based on our analysis of the electronic working records of
truckdrivers, I estimate, as Chairman DeFazio noted in his
introduction, that American long-haul, full-truckload
truckdrivers spend, on average, 6.5 hours of every working day
driving. Yet, according to Federal safety regulations, they are
allowed to drive for 11 hours per day. This, of course, implies
that 40 percent of America's trucking capacity is left on the
table every day. This is, of course, especially troubling
during times of perceived shortage and crisis, like we find
ourselves now.
I also observe across many thousands of pickup and delivery
appointments from all over the country that the detention of
truckdrivers varies in predictable cycles, based on the time of
day of their arrival. Drivers who arrive during typical first-
shift warehouse appointments--say, 5 or 6 a.m. to 2 or 3 p.m.--
are processed much more quickly, on average, than drivers who
arrive outside of these first-shift hours. This is true across
all datasets provided to our lab from multiple different
sources.
This leads me to first conclude, if you will allow me a
brief computing analogy, that what we are facing is sort of a
software problem, not necessarily a hardware problem, at the
warehouses and distribution centers where the truckdrivers show
up. That is, our existing warehouses and distribution centers
do show the capacity to get trucks loaded and unloaded
relatively quickly, but they do so only from around 6 a.m. to 2
p.m. on the weekdays, which represents one-third or less of
every working day.
I submit to this committee that America's current supply
chain problems are simply too big to commit only one-third of
our weekdays to our best efforts at unclogging them.
I would also like to address the patterns I observed when
analyzing behavior of the system by day of week. I observed
that long-haul truckdrivers who stay with their employers do
most of their driving on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays of
every week. They drive, on average, fewer hours on weekends.
This is, in itself, not wholly surprising. However, I have
compared these patterns in both soft markets, where drivers'
time is valued less in the marketplace, and tight markets,
where they have a price incentive to drive more. This
comparison test allows us to study what changes in pay actually
incentivize American drivers to do.
In my observation, it turns out that when truckdrivers are
paid more, they drive more, but that they can usually only find
those extra hours on the weekends. The increase in pay does not
result in statistically significant increases in driving hours
on weekdays. Why is this the case? I interpret this result as
further evidence that, as we currently have our American supply
chains programmed and scheduled, there is simply no available
extra truck driving capacity in the American system during the
workweek. The days that drivers show the ability to offer
additional surge capacity are on the weekends. Unfortunately, I
have also observed in the data and in anecdotal conversations
that there are far fewer freight appointments available to
American truckdrivers on weekends.
To conclude my comments, I hope that I have brought to this
committee the perspective of chronic American truckdriver
underutilization, which I believe to be generally
underappreciated, but fundamental to any meaningful effort to
come up with a solution. In fact, by my calculations, adding
only 18 valuable driving minutes back to every existing
truckdriver's day could be enough to overcome what many of us
feel is a driver shortage.
I hope I have conveyed the idea that solutions to the
truckdriver shortage are most readily found in the scheduling
practices of the shippers and receivers they visit, not behind
the wheel or in the cab of the truck itself.
And I hope that I have given some evidence to this
committee of the potential for large, aggregated boundary-
crossing datasets, like the ones I analyzed, to help us
scientifically identify where the problems in our American
supply chain lie.
I look forward to being as helpful to this body as I can
be. Thank you.
[Mr. Correll's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of David HC Correll, Ph.D., Research Scientist and
Lecturer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for
Transportation and Logistics
My name is Dr. David Correll. I am a Research Scientist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Transportation and
Logistics (MIT CTL). MIT CTL is an entity at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology that is focused on delivering high-quality
supply chain management education and applied and impactful research on
questions of logistics, transportation, planning.
At MIT CTL, I co-direct a research group called the MIT FreightLab,
which studies freight transportation, with a particular emphasis on
American trucking. In our lab, I lead a project called the Driver
Initiative, which looks to uncover new insights and identify specific
opportunities to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of
life of American over-the-road (OTR) truck drivers by analyzing data
from their daily work logs (Electronic Logging Devices ``ELDs''), as
well as the systems that schedule and monitor their pickups and
dropoffs (Transportation Management Systems ``TMSs'').
So far, my student teams and I have analyzed the working hours and
pickup and delivery experiences of approximately 4,000 OTR truck
drivers employed by one mid-sized and one large national carrier in
snapshots from 2016 to 2020. We have also analyzed thousands of freight
pickup and delivery appointments using data provided to us by shipper
and broker companies. We supplement this analytical work with frequent
conversations with truck drivers, their management, as well as the
shippers and receivers who hire these drivers' services.
This research program, along with ongoing conversations with
logistics and transportations professionals, leads me to a few
conclusions I am honored to share with your committee today.
Chronic Under-Utilization of the American Driver
First, I believe that the American truck driver is chronically
under-utilized, and has been since at least 2016 when our data begins.
Based on our analysis of electronic working records, I estimate that
American long-haul, full-truckload truck drivers spend, on average, 6.5
hours per working day driving their vehicles. Yet, according to hours
of service regulations, they are allowed to drive for a maximum of 11
hours per day. This implies that 40% of America's trucking capacity is
left on the table every day. [1] This result is especially troubling in
times of perceived shortage and crisis like we find ourselves today.
To put my argument in the context of the `driver shortage', the
American Trucking Association estimates the national driver deficit at
80,000 drivers. By my calculation, this represents about 4.4%
(conservatively) of the US Census Bureau's estimation of 1.8 million
employee Class-8 freight truck drivers in the United States [2]. Adding
4.5% back to a long-haul truck drivers' working day of 6.5 hours would
mean adding only 18 minutes. Seen this way, an 18-minute improvement to
the daily average utilization of America's existing cadre of truck
drivers could be equivalent in effect to recruiting new ones and then
similarly squandering their time too. My research leads me to see the
current situation not so much as a headcount shortage of drivers, but
rather an endemic undervaluing of our American truck drivers' time.
Detention's Daily Cycles
My analysis suggests that American truck drivers' daily driving
time is reduced by the systems and infrastructure that they are subject
to when they are loaded and unloaded. This same notion is frequently
referred to in the industry as driver detention. I observe across many
thousands of recorded pickup and delivery appointments from all over
the country that detention of truck drivers varies in predictable
cycles based on the time of day of their arrival. Drivers who arrive
during typical first-shift appointments (5 or 6 am to 2 or 3pm) are
processed much more quickly on average than drivers who arrive outside
of these hours. This is true across data sets provided to our lab for
analysis by trucking companies, shippers, and brokers, and covers all
types of freight appointments (`live loads' and `drop-and-hooks') and
types of customers. [3,4,5,6] This leads me personally to believe that
the detention problem is--to use an analogy--a software problem not a
hardware problem. That is, the warehouses and distribution centers that
we have show the capacity to get trucks loaded and unloaded quickly--
but they commit to staffing policies and plans that realize this
potential for only one-third or less of every working day. I submit to
this committee that America's current supply chain problems are too big
to commit only one-third of our weekdays to our best efforts at
unclogging them.
Long-Haul Truck Drivers' Weekly Cycles
Another issue that I study is truck driver retention. That is, how
can truck drivers' electronic logs predict if a driver will quit? This
work is ongoing and preliminary but offers a few insights already that
I think may be relevant to this committee's decision making. Long-haul
truck drivers who stay with their employers tend to do most of their
driving on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays of every week. They
drive on average, fewer hours on weekends. This is, in itself, not
wholly surprising. However, I have compared these patterns in both soft
(low price per mile for the driver) and tight (high price per mile for
the driver) markets. This comparison test allows us to study what
changes in pay actually incentivize America's truck drivers to do.
In my data, it turns out that when drivers are paid more, they
drive more on weekends, but the same amount on weekdays. The drivers'
average hours per day driving do not change on the money-making days
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays. On these days they reach the national
average of 6.5 hours per day or slightly more. However, higher prices
do seem to incent drivers to drive slightly, but significantly, more on
Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays [7]. Why is this the case? I interpret
this result as evidence that there is no available extra truck driver
capacity in the American system during the workweek, when facilities
are open but operating under staffing policies that de facto limit
drivers to only 6.5 hours daily driving. The only days that drivers
show the ability to offer additional surge capacity are on the
weekends. Unfortunately, I have also observed anecdotally that many
warehouses and distribution centers do not offer weekend freight
appointments, or if they do, it is in limited capacity.
Conclusions
My research leads me to see the issue of America's truck drivers
not as a crisis of head count, but rather of working hours. American
supply chains do not make effective use of the drivers we have, and
thereby reduces national competitiveness, contributes to the industry's
very high turnover rate, and makes doing a critical job at times very
unpleasant and less lucrative than it could be. I don't think that we
can afford to let any crisis go to waste, especially not this one. I
encourage this committee to consider measures to get more out of our
existing cadre of American truck drivers.
Recommendations
Below are two programs I recommend as starting points for
addressing the issues outlined in my testimony:
1.  Governmental leadership in coordinating, analyzing, and
distributing data on detention times at American shippers and
receivers. This extant data is typically siloed and difficult for any
one group to collect and to collate. Leadership from Washington could
facilitate overcoming these data collection obstacles.
2.  Governmental support for a standardized system of evaluation of
American shippers and receivers that measures both (1) detention time,
and (2) working conditions for visiting truck drivers. Standardizing
such an evaluation would allow carriers to more accurately price
services to underperforming shippers and receivers, and thereby unlock
more market pressure to reduce national detention times.

Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Doctor.
With that we turn to Greg Regan.
Mr. Regan. Thank you, Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member
Graves, for inviting me to testify today.
Before I begin, I want to take the opportunity to
acknowledge the anniversary of Larry Willis' untimely passing,
which occurred 1 year ago this month. His leadership at TTD,
the friendship and mentorship he gave me and our whole staff,
are severely missed by all of us as we reflect back on his
memory. Attending Monday's signing ceremony for the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was a reminder of
Larry's unflinching optimism that we can still get big things
done in this country. It is easy for any of us to fall into the
trappings of cynicism these days. But Larry never did. TTD and
the entire labor movement are better off because of it.
Now to the matter at hand. I am speaking to you today on
behalf of TTD's 33 affiliated unions, whose members have a
front-row seat to the very serious challenges facing America's
supply chain. They include the workers directly engaged in
freight transportation at railroads, at ports, and in trucking,
as well as those who work in industries like manufacturing,
that have been hamstrung by their inability to get materials in
a timely manner.
I must be perfectly clear on two points.
First, we cannot solve this problem by scapegoating
individuals who had nothing to do with its origins. Cynical
attempts to place the blame on President Biden, for example,
have no rooting in truth, and do nothing to alleviate the empty
shelves your constituents are seeing back home.
Second, there are some policymakers and pundits using this
opportunity to place the blame on hard-working Americans, to
undermine their collective bargaining rights, demean their
work, further deteriorate safety and working conditions, or to
eliminate their jobs altogether. Even on this panel, there are
those who believe that the solution is to continue the use of
perverse misclassification employment models, and to undermine
the right of workers to form and join unions. Placing blame for
this crisis on the shoulders of working people is unacceptable.
These are the very people who are laboring day and night to
tackle this crisis, and it is upon their shoulders that we will
find long-term solutions.
We know that the major contributing factors to this crisis
are a combination of a sudden spike in freight volume, coupled
with shortsighted industry practices that left our system
inelastic and incapable of meeting soaring demand.
Unfortunately, while the drastic spike in demand was
unpredictable, the results, in many ways, were inevitable.
For years, the Class I railroads have pursued an operating
model known as Precision Scheduled Railroading, or PSR. Through
the PSR model, the railroads all but ensured that their
operations would not be able to rapidly respond to economic
shocks or rapid changes in the flow of traffic, like those we
are now seeing.
The real-world impact of the freight railroad business
model is that they slashed 20 percent of their workforce in
just the 5 years prior to the pandemic, and levels have
continued to decline, even as businesses have rebounded and
carloads have returned to near 2019 levels. Greater and more
reliable freight rail service was obviously needed. The
railroads only dug in further to their profit-at-all-costs,
skeleton crew operations. Other freight railroad actions to eke
out every last dime, including the mothballing of locomotives,
left them even less prepared, less capable, and less safe.
Some claim a shortage of employees in the supply chain as a
major factor in this crisis. Such claims imply that workers
needed to perform the job do not exist today in this market.
This is simply not the case. COVID has awoken many Americans to
the real failures of our labor market. Many employers simply
fail to provide the incentives, including good wages, benefits,
and working conditions that will attract and retain skilled
workers. This is certainly true in rail, where our unions
report mid-career employees walking away from formerly good
jobs and secure retirements, due to eroding and deteriorating
workplace conditions.
We see a similar result in trucking, where enormous
turnover rates and abusive practices like intentional
misclassification are commonplace.
As Congress works to solve these ongoing challenges and
prevent future interruptions, we call on you to work closely
with supply chain employees and their union representatives
across the Nation to develop real solutions. Proposed solutions
must consider and address the impact that a reduced rail
workforce and degradation in service quality have had on supply
chain disruptions, let alone whether current railroad
operations are consistent with statutory common carrier
obligations.
Solutions must also include robust and well-directed
investments in our Nation's freight infrastructure. To that
end, we strongly applaud the enactment of the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act, which provides $2.2 billion for a port
infrastructure development program, offering a lifeline to the
almost half of all U.S. ports who state that better rail access
could increase throughput capacity by over 25 percent.
Congress should also consider novel approaches to supply
chain challenges that would create jobs and economic activity.
For example, the expansion of waterborne transportation
alternatives through our marine highways may ease the supply
chain bottleneck, particularly at major ports.
Finally, we once again call on you to reject ill-conceived
efforts to hijack the crisis to attack supply chain workers.
The pursuit of a more efficient supply chain cannot be an
excuse to eliminate or deconstruct critical regulatory
safeguards, such as fatigue protections, or to water down
carefully crafted training and qualification requirements.
Thank you again, and I look forward to the----
[Audio interruption.]
Mr. Regan [continuing]. Opportunity to answer your
questions.
[Mr. Regan's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Gregory R. Regan, President, Transportation
Trades Department, AFL-CIO
On behalf of the Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO (TTD)
and our 33 affiliated unions, I first want to thank Chairman DeFazio
and Ranking Member Graves for inviting me to testify before the
Committee today on the extremely timely issue of supply chain
challenges and congestion. The employees represented by TTD-affiliated
unions have had a front-row seat to the serious challenges facing
America's supply chain--including the workers directly engaged in
freight transportation at railroads and ports, and who work in
industries that have been hamstrung by the inability to procure key
materials in a timely manner.
The State of the Supply Chain
The fact that these disruptions have resulted in enormous economic,
financial, and environmental costs is clear. Despite no shortage of
finger-pointing and over-simplifying, we must acknowledge that the root
cause of our supply chain bottlenecks is multivariate. Principally, we
know that year to date, overall cargo volume through the Port of LA
Long Beach, for example, has increased by a massive 26% compared to
2020, driven in part by a sharp uptick in consumer demand for durable
goods.\1\ This remarkable rise in cargo volumes has stressed every
component of the freight transportation network, frequently to the
breaking point. By way of example, earlier this year, Union Pacific
found itself unable to clear backlogs, and stopped running desperately
needed trains between the West Coast and its Global IV gateway in
Chicago. Burlington Northern Santa Fe similarly began rationing service
over its LA-LB to Chicago routes. Still, today, dozens of cargo ships
remain anchored off the port, currently unable to dock due to lack of
capacity at port terminals. Terminal operators at both LA-LB and the
Port of Savannah are attempting to repurpose additional facilities to
store overflow containers, as storage at the port has been exhausted.

spending-during-covid19-pandemic.aspx
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is not surprising that this historic increase in cargo volumes
and demand would result in supply chain challenges. There are few if
any industries that would be positioned to handle this level of new
demand without difficulties. This is particularly true with one as
complex and interconnected as freight transportation. Ultimately, there
is no actor, decision, or policy that is individually responsible for
the scenario the nation finds itself in. However, as we seek to move
past these supply chain bottlenecks, Congress and the administration
must acknowledge and examine conditions that increased the severity of
the crisis, alongside efforts to alleviate the backlogs of today and
tomorrow.
I must also take this opportunity to be perfectly clear on one
point. There are many in Congress and in the industries our members
serve who are cynically using this opportunity to scapegoat hard-
working Americans, undermine their collective bargaining rights, and
further deteriorate safety and working conditions for supply chain
employees. Putting any amount of blame for this crisis on the shoulders
of your constituents--the American workers who drive this economy
through thick and thin--is unacceptable. We reject this misguided
placement of blame out of hand and urge all policy makers to do the
same.
Unexpected Conditions, Inevitable Results
The supply chain crisis has put a spotlight on components of the
freight network that were particularly ill-prepared for the demand
shock of the last year. Recently, 160 House Republicans signed on to a
letter which stated that ``The current supply chain crisis exposes how
close to its limit our transportation system operates. There is little
redundant capacity.'' \2\ TTD could not agree more strongly with this
analysis. There is nowhere where this lack of redundant capacity is and
was more acute than at Class I railroads.

crisis_letter.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As TTD has testified before this Committee several times
previously, for years the Class I railroads have pursued an operating
model known as precision scheduled railroading, or PSR. PSR operations
seek to maximize operating ratios--a railroad's expenses as a
percentage of revenue--to appease shareholders and increase returns.
Fundamentally, a PSR railroad abandons the traditional operating model
of a service industry that responds to the variable demand of its
customers. Instead, it operates on a regimented schedule more akin to
passenger rail. After eliminating on-demand response, flexibility in
the construction of train consists, and the availability of service,
railroads then jettison capital assets like locomotives and cars and
slash jobs across the network.
In doing so, Class I railroads all but ensured their operations
would not be able to rapidly respond to economic shocks or rapid
changes in the flow of traffic, like those the nation is currently
experiencing. This is evident in the hollowing out of the industry that
has taken place in recent years. During the five-year period between
2014 and 2019, Class I railroads eliminated a staggering 20% of their
overall workforce. I might add that many of these freight rail
employees have specialized skills and training--many require
certification--that are not easily replicated in the broad US
workforce.
Throughout the pandemic, employment dropped further as freight
volumes collapsed. However, freight rail has enjoyed a ``v-shaped''
recovery--carloads have nearly returned to 2019 levels. Yet, Class I
carriers today employ fewer employees than they did pre-pandemic, and
amid the supply chain crisis, employment continued to decrease in
August and September of this year. Further, in the first three quarters
of FYI '21, an analysis of four Class I railroads shows a shocking -
19.5% decrease in employee service hours compared to FY '19, while
handling only 3.2% fewer carloads. At a time when more, and more
reliable, freight rail service was badly needed, railroads have only
dug further into profit-first skeleton crew operations. We are
unequivocal--these reductions have resulted in a rail network that is
less prepared, less capable, and less safe.
Not only do railroads lack the personnel to respond nimbly to the
supply chain crisis, but they frequently also lack equipment. In its
2020 financial disclosures, Union Pacific stated that it had reduced
its active locomotive fleet by 24% and only managed to keep 58% of its
remaining locomotives in service. Other carriers have similarly
eliminated equipment, and TTD unions report that equipment not in use
is often not kept in a state of good repair, meaning that it cannot
quickly be put into service when needed. As a result, when a surge of
force was required to resolve congestion issues, railroads were left
without the institutional flexibility required to do so quickly.
Service that has run between LA-LB, Chicago, and other hubs bears
evidence of PSR, as railroads continued to prioritize shareholder
returns over high-quality operations during the worst moments of the
supply chain crisis. We are aware of at least one Class I that
restricted many of its trains, including those serving the West Coast,
to traveling at a speed of 40 M.P.H despite operating over track rated
for much higher speeds. These limitations are unrelated to safety or
operational requirements, but instead exist to extract further revenue
by reducing fuel costs, even if doing so further exacerbates delays and
supply chain chokepoints.
While drastic spikes in demand were always likely to result in
significant operational challenges, the lack of elasticity among
freight railroads has worsened and extended supply chain challenges.
Rail labor is not alone in identifying the industry as an ongoing
chokepoint in the supply chain crisis. Surface Transportation Board
Chairman Marty Oberman penned a letter on preparedness to railroad CEOs
stating his concern about ``the extent to which these service issues
may be related to or exacerbated by a broader trend of rail labor
reductions that has been occurring over the past several years.'' In
additional remarks, he added that ``operating the railroads with that
many fewer employees makes it difficult to avoid cuts in service,
provide more reliable service, and reduce poor on-time performance that
does not compete well with truck.''
While rail carriers will cite that some metrics have improved, many
of these improvements are recent--for example, rail dwell times at West
Coast ports didn't begin a sustained decrease until August.\3\ Further,
despite these efforts intermodal rail volumes have actually decreased
year over year, with U.S. intermodal volumes for September 6.7% lower
than September 2020, as shippers look elsewhere to move cargo.\4\ It is
clear that challenges persist, and have persisted longer than they
needed to.

Good Jobs Attract Strong Workforces
Today, Class I's are acknowledging the need to hire additional
employees to meet demand, and we strongly encourage them to do so.
However, in a tight labor market,\5\ rail employers are pointing to so-
called ``labor shortages'' as an explanation for ongoing difficulties
in staffing. TTD rejects any characterization that the rail industry is
suddenly experiencing a shortage beyond its control, given the
calculated elimination of tens of thousands of jobs over the past
decade. If the existing rail workforce is inadequate to handle current
freight demand, and we believe that it is, this is the result of
intentional decision-making by Class I carriers as they've embraced the
PSR model. They must be held accountable during this supply chain
crisis for decisions that have contracted our freight rail capacity and
left our economy in a worse state as a result.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=E9Bs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not only have carriers drastically cut headcount, but they have
also fostered workplace conditions that have degraded the quality of
railroad employment. TTD unions have increasingly reported on the
phenomenon of mid-career rail employees resigning from well-paying jobs
and giving up stable retirements due to an unwillingness to continue to
work in unsafe conditions where the perpetual threat of furlough looms
large. According to data provided by the Railroad Retirement Board,
even when adjusting for retirements, approximately 7,200 employees left
the rail industry during the pandemic. The bulk of these individuals
were employed by Class I railroads. While targeted hiring campaigns and
incentive programs to boost ranks are certainly welcomed, an ongoing
exodus of highly-skilled and experienced employees is liable to
undermine any forward progress.
More generally, we do not believe that a shortage of employees in
the supply chain is a factor in current conditions. A workforce
shortage implies that the workers needed to perform a job do not exist
in the market. What we have today in our economy is the failure of
employers to respond to market conditions and provide the incentives--
wages, benefits, working conditions, that will attract the workforce
they need. In addition to rail, proponents of the shortage explanation
frequently cite trucking as an example of an industry where total
employment is lacking despite best efforts. Yet, the 90% turnover rate
for long-haul truckers speaks to a similar market response from drivers
who are disinterested in long hours, low wages, and a difficult working
environment.\6\ As an example, port truck drivers working for XPO
Logistics recently won a settlement of nearly $30M after successfully
arguing that they had been willfully misclassified under federal labor
law, to deny them fair wages, benefits, and bargaining rights.\7\ The
mistreatment faced by XPO drivers, operating in a key node of the
supply chain, was hardly unique. The failure of an employer to
incentivize its future workforce is not synonymous with a labor
shortage, and the solutions are not interchangeable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Path Forward
As Congress and the administration continue to work to solve the
ongoing challenges, and prevent future interruptions of this magnitude,
we call on you to work closely with supply chain employees and their
union representatives across the nation to develop long and short-term
solutions to the supply chain crisis.
This must include considerations of the impacts of the drastic
reduction in the rail workforce and degradation in service quality, how
these factors have contributed to supply chain disruptions, and even if
the manner in which railroads have chosen to operate is consistent with
statutory common carrier obligations. We encourage the pursuit of long-
term structural changes that will reverse the current path of the
industry and return to the prioritization of long-term viability, high-
quality service, and the creation and support of thousands of good
jobs.
Solutions must also include robust and well-directed investments in
our nation's freight infrastructure. To this end, TTD strongly applauds
the enactment of the generational Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act (IIJA). We thank President Biden and Vice President Harris for
their leadership, Chairman DeFazio for his unceasing commitment to a
revolutionary modernization of our nation's infrastructure, and the
members of Congress who understood the importance and impact of passing
the IIJA.
As policymakers and the private sector consider strategies to
expedite the flow of goods at major ports, the $2.2 billion the bill
contains for the Port Infrastructure Development Program offers a
lifeline to the nearly half of U.S. ports that state that better rail
access could increase throughput capacity by over 25%.\8\ To achieve
the greatest economic impact for IIJA, it is essential that the
legislation is implemented in a way that sustains good-paying jobs
while acting as an economic force multiplier throughout the supply
chain.

State%20of%20Freight%20III.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congress should also consider novel approaches to supply chain
challenges that would create jobs and economic activity. For example,
the expansion of waterborne transportation alternatives through our
Marine Highways may alleviate symptoms of a supply chain bottleneck,
particularly at major ports. Short sea shipping is the practice of
commercial waterborne transportation utilizing America's Marine
Highways and is a practical alternative to moving freight from major
ports to its destination. Typically, cargos arrive at large U.S. ports
aboard massive deep-sea vessels, are unloaded, and then transferred to
trucks and rail carriers. A fully developed short sea shipping sector,
utilizing smaller cargo vessels, would supplement and complement
services provided by rail and truck transportation and would provide
shippers with an additional alternative to direct goods to their final
destination. In addition, being able to use our waterways more
consistently would create benefits for the U.S. maritime industry by
creating good jobs aboard vessels and at ports and shipyards, while
reducing port congestion.
We also call on you to reject ill-conceived efforts to hijack the
crisis to attack supply chain workers and their industries. The pursuit
of a more efficient supply chain cannot be an excuse to eliminate or
deconstruct critical regulatory safeguards, such as fatigue
protections, or to water down carefully crafted training and
qualification requirements. In particular, we strenuously oppose
legislation that seeks to amend long-standing labor law to deny
collective bargaining rights. Transportation labor views any such
efforts as an unwarranted and deeply misguided assault on employees in
the supply chain who continue to work tirelessly to keep the economy
and the flow of commerce moving.
TTD thanks the Committee for the opportunity to testify today on
the significant challenges facing our supply chain. We look forward to
continuing to work together to alleviate current congestion and to
foster more resilient freight transportation industries well into the
future.

Mr. DeFazio. Eleanor, please mute. I think it is you. No,
you are muted. Who is it?
OK, whoever is not muted, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Regan. Now we will move to questions. I
first recognize myself.
Dr. Correll, I had read your written testimony, and the 18
minutes was something novel that I didn't see, or maybe I
missed in the written testimony. Could you go over that again?
I mean, 18 minutes would do what for our efficiency, and
backlog, and need for drivers?
Mr. Correll. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question. So, the
origin of that calculation is to take the number that my
colleagues at the ATA bring up for the estimate of the size of
the truckdriver shortage. So, when we look at that, you know,
how many is it this year, they just came out with a new number
of 80,000 truckdrivers short.
Where I come up with my calculations to say, all right,
well, how many truckdrivers do we have? And so, according to
the U.S. Census data, we have 1.8 million. Well, 80,000 is
around 4\1/2\ percent of 1.8 million. How do we add 4\1/2\
percent back to our existing population of drivers, instead of
bringing in a new headcount? If we do that, it is only 18
minutes.
So, the idea of that calculation is to look at the estimate
of the shortage, and look at a solution that is not raising
headcount, but raising utilization.
Mr. DeFazio. That is a pretty extraordinary figure.
Both to you and to maybe Mr. Spear and Ms. Reinke, the
issue of detention time. We used to penalize the warehouses if
they made people sit. Right now, that is no cost to them. You
sit, you run out of time, you sit. You know, you drive out of
service, or whatever. How can we rectify that?
Mr. Spear. That is----
Mr. DeFazio. Briefly.
Mr. Spear. I will go first with that, Mr. Chairman. It is a
relationship that we have to improve with those that we are
picking up from. There are instances that we have had where our
drivers aren't even allowed to park on their property, unless
it is within a defined period of time. And if they are later in
traffic, and they get there and miss their window, then they
have to wait longer. If they do get on the property, they are
not even allowed to use the restroom. Our drivers are treated
deplorably in many instances. It is a relationship that we just
have to improve.
These folks are moving 72.5 percent of the domestic freight
in this country, and they are heroes. They have been doing it
throughout the pandemic. When everybody ran for cover, these
folks got in their trucks, and got the job done. They restocked
the shelves, and now they are moving the vaccine. So, for them
to be treated like this, to wait indefinitely, is a serious
problem, and it is measurable, and it is impactful on us. That
time reduces the clock that they can drive.
So, it is--the 6 hours, or what was mentioned earlier, is a
figure that comes from that. It also comes from congestion,
which the IIJA is going to, obviously, alleviate. So, there are
improvements in that, that that number should go up as we spend
less time in traffic.
Detention is still an issue. That is not in the IIJA, and
it is just something that we are going to have to work with
folks in our supply chain to resolve, because it is just
untenable. It is not sustainable to have drivers wait that long
and run their clocks down. It is not productive for the entire
economy.
Mr. DeFazio. OK, thank you.
Ms. Reinke, from a broker's perspective?
Ms. Reinke. Yes, I couldn't agree with Mr. Spear more. It
is a relationship issue. Our members, our brokers want to
maintain good relationships with their motor carrier customers
because, otherwise, if they don't, those guys don't--guys and
gals--don't come back to them. And we are only as good as the
relationships we have with our shippers, on the one hand, and
the motor carriers on the other. So, it doesn't do any good to
have the carriers waiting outside.
Now, obviously, there is a warehouse labor shortage, as you
know; that is certainly what we are seeing. We want to work
together to devise a solution. We are in absolute agreement.
Mr. DeFazio. OK, thank you. How about from an economist's
perspective, Mr. Cordero?
Mr. Correll. For me, or for Mr. Cordero?
Mr. DeFazio. No, sorry, for you, Mr. Correll, yes.
Mr. Correll. No problem, thank you. So, from someone who
analyzes data perspective, I think there is a great opportunity
here, and I would like to represent it just briefly by way of
analogy. If I go to a restaurant in New York City, I can look
at the New York Board of Health food safety grade as a letter
grade outside that restaurant, and know what I am working with,
or what I am getting into by going to that restaurant.
I think that aggregating and collecting data on detention
time at our shippers, and also collecting data on their
experience, and the dignity with which they are treated at the
facilities, like Mr. Spear brought up, creating that kind of
dataset would be very valuable in one obvious way that we could
make public, some of these issues that I think we are all
acknowledging we see.
But the second way is that it could unlock market potential
to improve it, because, without that kind of aggregated
dataset, our carrier community can't accurately price in
expected detention or expected poor treatment of their drivers
at facilities. If we aggregated those rankings, similar to the
way we do with restaurants, we could communicate to the carrier
community, ``This is what you are getting if you do business
there, and price it as you need to, to make it worth your
time.'' I think it would be a very helpful innovation, using
the data.
Mr. DeFazio. Interesting. So, I wonder who we would get to
do that.
Ms. Reinke, would brokers be an appropriate place to
aggregate and publicize that?
Ms. Reinke. Well, to the extent we have visibility into
that data, sure, we, you know----
Mr. DeFazio. Well, I mean, you are dispatching loads. The
drivers could--you could ask them, ``What was your experience,
how long did you wait, how were you treated,'' and aggregate
it.
Ms. Reinke. Right. I mean, data is the coin of the realm.
And typically, you are right, brokers have access to a lot of
data, across--from the beginning of the transaction, the middle
of the transaction, to the end of the transaction. So, yes.
Mr. DeFazio. OK, anybody else have any ideas on that? This
has really been something I have been working on for more than
15 years, detention time issues.
Mr. Correll. Just a technical note, if it is helpful to
you, Chairman DeFazio.
So, when I do this for the companies that share their data
with me, one of the things that I can do is give them a quick
letter grade--A, B, C, D--on all of their customers for
detention. That tends to be valuable, from a management
perspective.
The problem of trying to do it--so, a carrier can do it
with places they have already visited, but they won't have any
data for somewhere they have never visited. And so, if they ask
another company and say, what was your experience at this
place, each company codes it in their own unique way, which is
not readable across all the different companies. So, if I am
going to Company XYZ in Des Moines, Iowa, my naming convention
will not be readable to all the other companies that might use
their own naming conventions.
So, that is somewhere I think Federal leadership could
help, giving a standardized, unique identifying code to all of
our shippers and warehouses, so we have a way to know exactly
who we are talking about when we share these ratings.
Mr. DeFazio. OK, interesting. Sort of a private-sector
solution to a private-sector problem. So, thank you.
OK, my time has expired. I would now recognize Ranking
Member Graves.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman----
Mr. DeFazio. Oh, sorry, Ranking Member Crawford, I am
sorry.
Mr. Crawford. That is no problem. Thank you. Just real
quick, I have a letter here from the Agricultural
Transportation Working Group submitted in response to the U.S.
Department of Transportation's request for information that
will be used to prepare a report for President Biden on supply
chains for the industrial base. I would ask unanimous consent
to have that entered into the record.

RE: Docket No. DOT-OST-2021-0106

Dear Secretary Buttigieg:
The associations that make up the Agricultural Transportation
Working Group (ATWG) submit this statement in response to the U.S.
Department of Transportation's (USDOT) request for information that
will be used to prepare a report for President Biden on supply chains
for the industrial base.
The undersigned agricultural producer, commodity, agribusiness and
food-related national organizations respectfully request the Biden
administration's support to advance transportation infrastructure and
policies for truck, rail, waterways and ports that will enhance the
efficient and cost-effective transport of agricultural and food
products. The farmers, ranchers, food and beverage manufacturers,
processors, package suppliers, farm supply dealers and agricultural
product marketers that comprise our collective memberships are
dedicated to providing safe, abundant, affordable and sustainably
produced human and animal food, fiber and other agricultural products
that directly benefit U.S. and global consumers and contribute
significantly to U.S. economic growth and trade. Importantly, they also
support and sustain millions of American jobs, many in rural
communities.
The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent surge in consumer demand has
resulted in major supply chain disruptions, including in the food and
agricultural supply chain. The disruptions are ongoing, and the work
performed by President Biden's Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force that
is co-chaired by the Secretaries of Transportation, Agriculture and
Commerce is important to support resilient, diverse, and secure supply
chains. Such supply chains are buttressed by strong transportation
infrastructure and flexible policy and are needed to ensure America's
farmers, ranchers, commodity handlers, processors and food
manufacturers can reliably deliver high-quality, cost-effective
products to domestic and global consumers.
More needs to be done to institutionalize the lessons that are
being learned from the pandemic to ensure resiliency of the food and
agricultural supply chain. We respectfully offer for your consideration
the following recommendations:
Labor
Presently, inadequate labor availability is the largest supply
chain constraint facing the U.S. agricultural industry. ATWG members
are unable to fill open positions throughout the production,
transportation, warehousing, and processing phases of the supply chain.
These shortages are directly impacting our members' ability to meet
consumer demands. Not only does a labor shortage make it difficult to
keep pace with open positions, but it also makes it more challenging to
add shifts to keep pace with increasing demand for agricultural
products. The lack of access to labor threatens operations and supply
chain resiliency and leads to lost productivity and higher prices for
food and agricultural products along the supply chain.
During the pandemic, as agriculture continued to operate while also
prioritizing the health and safety of their employees, the shortages of
personal protective equipment, disinfectants, and other COVID-19
mitigation tools created challenges. In planning for the next crisis,
the U.S. government should ensure that the food supply chain continues
to be deemed essential and receives priority access to necessary
supplies in future response plans. Furthermore, the U.S. government
should consider efforts to create national stockpiles of supplies, such
as respirators and face masks which are required for application of
certain pesticides.
Specifically, within DOT's jurisdiction, policies to increase
trucking productivity would be helpful as would harmonizing the federal
truck driving age limit with the state age limit to provide a more
accessible pathway into the trucking industry for drivers aged 18-20.
Another specific concern is how a forthcoming Emergency Temporary
Standard (ETS) regarding vaccines is implemented. We support the use of
vaccines to fight the spread of COVID-19, but as announced, the ETS
could cause serious labor disruptions for agribusinesses. We encourage
the administration to continue to recognize the critical infrastructure
status of the food and agriculture sector and provide flexibility for
agricultural employers to avoid the negative effects a vaccine mandate
would have on the efficiency and reliability of the agricultural supply
chain. We would like to partner in developing solutions and educational
programs that will expand the number of vaccinated workers without
introducing additional risks to the agricultural supply chain.
Climate Policy
The ability for the U.S. food and agricultural sector to continue
as the world's largest hinges on the availability of cropland to
produce raw agricultural commodities. The production of raw
agricultural commodities is the beginning and most important part of
the food and agricultural supply chain. An abundant, affordable,
sustainable, and wholesome supply of raw agricultural commodities is a
prerequisite for the remaining steps in the food and agricultural
supply chain.
Due to the inherent linkage between the first step in the food and
agricultural supply chain, the production of raw agricultural
commodities, and the climate change policies that are under
consideration, the ATWG urges the Transportation, Agriculture and
Commerce Departments to assess their climate change policies and supply
chain policies in tandem. Policies that idle cropland and reduce U.S.
agricultural output result in less U.S. agricultural market share and
harm rural economies.
As an alternative to cropland idling climate change polices, the
ATWG urges the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to prioritize
federal resources toward working land programs to achieve large
environmental and economic benefits by incentivizing broader adoption
of best management farming and ranching practices across potentially
hundreds of millions of our nation's best acres for agricultural
production.
Transportation Policy and Infrastructure
The ATWG recommends strengthening U.S. freight transportation
policy and infrastructure to help ensure there are many efficient ways
for agricultural commodities and products to flow throughout the
agricultural supply chain. The ATWG believes the U.S. freight
transportation system can be strengthened through the following ways:
1.  Adopt solutions to better balance the needs of ocean carriers
with the needs of our agricultural exports.
2.  Increase federal investment to modernize U.S. inland waterways
locks and dams--particularly those on the Upper Mississippi River and
Illinois River (UMR-IR) System--and fully utilizing the Harbor
Maintenance Trust Fund for its intended purpose of dredging U.S. ports
and harbors.
3.  Foster increased competition among freight railroads and other
transportation modes, provide a better method for challenging
unreasonable rail rates and require railroad carriers to provide
increased access to railroad service data to enhance agricultural
supply chain operations.
4.  Increase motor carrier capacity through regulatory reform and
legislative change and investing strategically in rural roads and
bridges through collaboration with states.
Container Shipping
We are supportive of efforts to better balance the needs of ocean
carriers with the needs of our agricultural exports. Concerns over
ocean carriers and terminals practices at U.S. ports include ignoring
the Federal Maritime Commission's existing demurrage and detention
guidelines, making containers unavailable to carry agricultural export
cargo, cancelling or refusing export container bookings and a
persistent lack of timely notice of changes to U.S. shippers.
The lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic's shock to global
trade have resulted in a backlog of container ships waiting to unload
outside the West Coast's most critical shipping ports. Ongoing
congestion and related logistical obstacles threaten U.S. farmers' and
ranchers' ability to meet much-welcome increases in foreign demand for
our products.
Elevated imports and exports have caused considerable congestion
both on water and land as the ports fill with the extra containers. To
avoid congestion and to get containers back to Asia as quickly as
possible so that they can be refilled with more import goods, there has
been an increase in the shipment of empty containers out of the West
Coast ports. Some consider it more efficient to ship empty containers,
rather than waiting for export goods to be loaded, which has led to a
significant decline in the number of containers available to
agricultural exporters.
Across California's three major ports, the shipment of empty
containers jumped 56% from an average of 1.16 million TEUs (20-foot
equivalent units) in the first quarters of 2018-2020 to 1.81 million
TEUs in the first quarter of 2021. Compared to the first quarter of
2020 alone, the first quarter of 2021 represents an 80% increase in
empty export container units. At the Port of Los Angeles, in 2021,
through July, nearly 75% of all exported containers were empty.
Accessibility to export containers has been further limited by record
shipping costs and harmful surcharges. With these factors combined, the
ability for farmers and ranchers to fulfill oversees contracts has been
significantly impacted, with some estimations nearing $1.5 billion in
lost agricultural exports.
All these harmful patterns are contributing to supply chain
dysfunction, increased costs for U.S. agricultural exporters and
preventing U.S. shippers from capturing export opportunities. The ocean
shipping industry has vastly changed in recent years, increasingly to
the detriment of U.S. exporters.
Inland Waterways
A modern, efficient inland waterways transportation system (locks
and dams) is critical to U.S. agriculture and the entire U.S. economy.
Our nation's inland water navigation system is a low-cost and
environmentally sustainable way to get crop inputs, such as fertilizer
and farm supplies, to farmers and for delivering harvests, such as
grains and other crops, to domestic and international markets. In 2020,
the United States exported 29 percent of its grains and oilseeds. Of
this quantity, more than half transited the Mississippi River System,
while 29 percent moved through the Columbia-Snake River System in the
Pacific Northwest, and 5 percent was shipped through the Texas Gulf.
U.S. agricultural exports traditionally contribute a nearly $15-$20
billion surplus to the U.S. balance of trade, as well as provide
upwards of 20 percent of U.S. farm income.
Unfortunately, most locks on the UMR-IR System were built in the
1930's and have long surpassed their projected 50-year design life.
These locks were built when 600-foot locks were the standard. Today, a
full barge tow is 1,200-feet so upgrading this aging infrastructure is
a necessity and will strengthen U.S. agricultural competitiveness and
the resilience of the country's supply chain. A 2016 study by the
University of Tennessee and funded by USDA, looked at two locks along
the UMR-IR and found that unscheduled outages would result in the loss
of 12,500 jobs and reduce economic activity by $4.2 billion.
Another significant study issued in August 2019 and conducted by
Agribusiness Consulting (formerly Informa Economics) under a contract
with the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service, entitled ``Importance of
Inland Waterways to U.S. Agriculture'', quantified both the critical
connection between the inland waterways and the competitiveness of
American agriculture in global markets, as well as the economic costs
of delaying renovation of America's river transport network.
Among other things, the study found that the inland waterways
system saves between $7 billion to $9 billion annually over the cost of
shipping by other modes (values based on all goods currently being
moved on the water compared to the same volume transported by rail). It
also found that every dollar of waterways activity output results in
$1.89 in additional U.S. economic activity directly related to the
waterways.
Most significantly, the study found that compared to the status
quo, increasing investment in the inland waterways system by $6.3
billion over a 10-year period (through 2029) and $400 million per year
thereafter through 2045 cumulatively would grow the waterways'
contribution to U.S. gross domestic product by 20 percent (to $64
billion) and increase waterways-related employment by 19 percent, to
472,000 jobs. The study says this option would more than offset the
cost of completing all the proposed projects and would increase the
market value of U.S. corn and soybeans by $39 billion. Conversely,
reduced investment would decrease the market value of those commodities
by $58 billion.
In addition to the economic and competitiveness enhancing benefits
of the inland waterways transportation system, the environmental and
energy efficiency qualities must also be recognized. According to a
2017 study by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute prepared for the
National Waterways Foundation, barge transportation produces the least
amount of CO2 emissions compared to rail (30% more) & truck (1,000%
more). Further, a 15-barge tow can carry the same amount of cargo as
1,050 semi-trucks or 216 railcars. Barge transportation is the most
fuel-efficient form of surface transportation and policymakers should
prioritize the modernization of U.S. locks and dams in any
infrastructure bill as well as the annual appropriations process.
Specifically, the ATWG urges support for the funding and
construction of the top 15 lock and dam projects identified by the Army
Corps of Engineers in the 2020 Capital Investment Strategy (CIS). The
CIS outlines a scenario where all 15 projects could be constructed in
10 years at a cost of $7 billion. This includes seven additional 1,200-
foot locks on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway as part
of the Navigation Ecosystem Sustainability Program (NESP). Lock and Dam
25 on the Upper Mississippi River is part of NESP, and the top ranked
new construction start on this list of 15 priority projects. The ATWG
urges USDA to continue to reinforce with Congress and the Office of
Management and Budget, the importance of funding and constructing the
NESP locks and dams to bring U.S. inland waterways transportation into
the 21st century.
Rail Competition and Service
Rail transportation remains an important mode for transporting
agricultural products, even though its modal share has declined
significantly. While truck and water transportation are often viewed as
potential competitors to rail, they have significant limitations that
prevent them from providing effective competition on all but a narrow
range of movements. Water transportation cannot compete with rail
except for traffic moving between an origin and destination on a
navigable waterway. Truck transportation is significantly less
efficient than rail, making it uncompetitive except for short
distances. Today, four railroads haul more than 90 percent of all
freight rail traffic and rail rates \1\ have crossed a threshold that
can make truck transportation the only viable option for many shippers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Rail rates to ship anhydrous ammonia, which is a key ingredient
for 75% of the essential fertilizers utilized by farmers, have
increased over 200% in the past 20 years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rail carrier implementation of large cost-cutting initiatives, such
as so-called precision scheduled railroading (PSR), have disrupted rail
service to many agricultural shippers. PSR focuses on removing network
capacity in rail carrier operations to increase their operating-ratio
profits. The loss of this capacity generally results in poor service
for shipping and receiving customers and removes substantial rail
network elasticity. This can turn an upward change in demand or a
weather event into a severe and long-lasting disruption to service. The
removal of capacity through PSR may make the rail carriers slightly
more profitable but it comes at a high cost for rail customers in the
agricultural sector.
The ATWG believes it is necessary to seek all available options to
increase competition among freight railroads and other transportation
modes and provide shippers and receivers with increased access to
railroad service information to enable informed business and capital
investment planning.
The Surface Transportation Board (STB) can increase competition
among railroads by finalizing a long-pending proceeding on reciprocal
(also referred to as ``competitive'') switching. Competitive switching
will enable shippers and receivers that are captive to one rail
carrier, but are near a second rail carrier, to gain access to the
second carrier via a short distance switch.
For shippers and receivers that are not close to a second rail
carrier to benefit from competitive switching, there is a rulemaking
underway at STB--known as the Final Offer Rate Review--that the ATWG
hopes will result in a more streamlined, simplified, and less costly
process for challenging unreasonable rail rates.
Lastly, greater access to rail carrier data is needed by shippers
and receivers to help optimize their supply chain operations. The ATWG
commends STB for requesting information on first-mile/last-mile rail
service, which is an often overlooked, but extremely important area in
the agricultural supply chain.
While STB has jurisdiction over disputes related to railroad
service and rates, there are some areas where the USDOT can help. The
DOT has delegated authority to the rail industry via the Association of
American Railroads (AAR) Tank Car Committee (TCC). For many years,
shippers have been trying to work with AAR and DOT to reform the
processes of the TCC. Historically, TCC has imposed measures on
shippers that raise serious concerns about the extent of TCC authority.
While this is a complicated issue, to date, DOT has not responded to a
shipper-industry petition filed in 2016 on this matter.\2\ In recent
years, regulatory actions imposed or initiated by the TCC, without a
cost-benefit analysis, have raised shipping costs for the fertilizer
industry by millions of dollars. DOT can and should make an effort to
reform the AAR Tank Car Committee.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Motor Carrier Freight Transportation Efficiency
The ATWG believes supply chain resiliency can be enhanced by
strengthening the motor carrier freight transportation sector through
streamlined and cost-effective regulatory and/or legislative policy. To
increase transportation capacity and efficiency of this sector, the
ATWG recommends the following regulatory and legislative policies:
1.  Adoption of policies to mitigate the ongoing truck driver
shortage, such as removing the commercial driver's license (CDL)
restrictions on drivers aged 18-20 that creates an obstacle to
recruiting a new generation of drivers into the industry. There are 49
U.S. states that allow 18-year-olds to obtain a CDL, but federal law
prohibits them from driving across state lines until they are 21. The
ATWG is supportive of pathways that include additional training to
bring more drivers aged 18-20 into the industry.
2.  With the challenges facing supply chains and a shortage of
drivers, we continue to see bottlenecks, supply constraints and
increased costs when moving goods across the country. As we saw in the
early days of the pandemic, much of the agriculture supply chain relies
on just-in-time delivery. This is also extremely important when
considering the need for animal feed, farm supplies to arrive at the
appropriate time during planting season as well as completing harvest
before crops spoil or the season ends. It is also critical that we can
safely transport our live animals and insects to their destinations
without delay.
We recommend that USDA and USDOT continue to coordinate to
ensure agricultural haulers and the rest of the trucking industry have
the flexibilities needed to provide timely delivery of essential
products. Flexibilities such as relief from Hours-of-Service
requirements have been critical over the last 18 months. Our industry
has proven that we can maintain a high level of safety while also
efficiently delivering wholesome and affordable food to the American
consumer.
3.  Adoption of a 10% axle tolerance for dry bulk shipments. This
bipartisan policy, supported by Rep. Anthony Brown (D-Md.) and Rep.
Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), was included in H.R. 3684, the INVEST in
America Act.
Load shifts during transport can result in tickets for drivers
because a portion of the truck becomes heavier than allowed under
current law, even though the overall truck weight is below the federal
truck weight limit of 80,000 pounds. The ATWG supports this policy
already adopted by 38 states on state/county roads that authorizes an
axle weight tolerance to account for this shifting during transport.
4.  Adoption of a pilot program to achieve economic and
environmental efficiencies through a modest increase in federal truck
weight limits.
Lower Interstate Highway System truck weight limits relative
to state road truck weight limits are a barrier to economic and
environmental efficiency. The 80,000-lbs. gross vehicle weight (GVW)
limit on Interstate Highways has been in place since 1982 despite major
advancements in vehicle safety and paving technology.
If a state's truck weight limit for its roads is 91,000 pounds
and the Interstate Highway weight limit is 80,000 pounds, and the route
includes an Interstate Highway then the driver's utilized freight limit
is only 80,000 pounds. This can prevent trucks from utilizing the best
shipping route if it includes Interstate Highways, which are our
nation's safest and best built and maintained roads. A tractor-trailer
combination loaded to 80,000 pounds carries approximately 50,000 pounds
of freight. At 91,000 pounds, the tractor-trailer combination carries
about 60,000 pounds of freight, amounting to about a 20 percent
increase in freight efficiency and an associated reduction in its
carbon footprint.
The ATWG urges authorization of an opt-in pilot program to
modestly increase truck weight limits by allowing 91,000-lb., six-axle
vehicles on federal Interstate Highways in 10 states. This
configuration complies with the federal bridge formula and is shown to
have better braking capacity than 80,000-lb., five-axle trucks.
In March 2020, Congress provided states with the option to
determine truck weight limits for 120 days through Section 22003 of the
CARES Act and the ensuing trucking efficiencies were gained safely.
5.  Maintaining the existing minimum financial liability coverage
level for motor carriers.
Efforts to increase liability insurance for motor carriers
beyond the current $750,000 level will increase freight costs without
any known safety benefits. Annual premiums for each truck are already
significant at about $5,000 per year. Whereas the minimum automobile
liability insurance for most states is less than $100,000, which is
inequitable to the $750,000 minimum for truck financial liability.
Raising the minimum financial liability coverage level for motor
carriers will increase the already inequitable difference between
coverage for automobiles and motor carriers.
6.  Support necessary reforms to modernize the Farm-Related
Restricted CDL program, which has currently been adopted by 24 states.
The Farm-Related Restricted Commercial Driver's License (CDL) or more
commonly referred to as the ``Seasonal Ag CDL'' program has been an
essential seasonal program for farm-related service industries since
1992. These industries have a very strong transportation safety record
and it has not been diminished since these federal regulations have
been in place. The Seasonal Ag CDL program has helped promote economic
growth for America's agricultural industries serving the essential
needs of farmers during the busy planting and harvesting seasons. Due
to challenging weather events, the increase in crop production
diversification, technological advances and weight increases in light
duty pickup trucks and agricultural equipment over the past several
decades, it is necessary to modernize the federal regulations providing
the framework for these state administered programs. The temporary
shutdown of the state Department of Motor Vehicles offices throughout
the nation during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic also caused major
disruptions for farm-related service industries and their rural
communities.
More flexibility is needed and can be provided by expanding
the total days allowed to utilize Farm-Related Restricted CDL drivers
by up to 270 days to accommodate for the longer seasons, which can
fluctuate from year to year due to climate change as well as more
diversified crop production. Individual states would maintain the
ability to set the seasons these days could be utilized by the
industry. The new 12-month seasons restart should occur each calendar
year on January 1 to prevent any overlap of seasons from the previous
year and the requirement for an in-person seasonal renewal should be
eliminated.
Concluding Statement
The ATWG commends the Departments of Transportation, Agriculture
and Commerce for seeking ways to support resilient, diverse, and secure
supply chains to help ensure U.S. economic prosperity and national
security. Such supply chains are needed to ensure America's farmers,
ranchers, commodity handlers, processors and food manufacturers can
reliably deliver high-quality, cost-effective products to domestic and
global consumers.
The ATWG's most pressing recommendation is to address labor
availability, which is among the largest supply chain constraints
facing the agricultural sector. The lack of access to labor threatens
operations and supply chain resiliency and leads to lost productivity
and higher prices for food and agricultural products along the supply
chain. Specifically, within DOT's jurisdiction, policies to increase
trucking productivity would be helpful as would harmonizing the federal
truck driving age limit with the state age limit to provide a more
accessible pathway into the trucking industry for drivers aged 18-20.
Further, the ATWG recommends USDA agencies collaborate on their
climate change and supply chain polices due to their inherent linkage
to the production of raw agricultural commodities--the first step in
the food and agricultural supply chain and the most likely step to be
impacted by climate change policies. As an alternative to cropland
idling climate change polices, the ATWG urges USDA to prioritize
federal resources toward working land programs to achieve large
environmental and economic benefits by incentivizing broader adoption
of best management farming and ranching practices.
The ATWG supports strengthening U.S. freight transportation policy
and infrastructure to help ensure there are many efficient ways for
agricultural commodities and products to flow throughout the
agricultural supply chain. The ATWG believes the U.S. freight
transportation system can be strengthened through the following ways:
1,  Adopt solutions to better balance the needs of ocean carriers
with the needs of our agricultural exports.
2,  Increase federal investment to modernize U.S. inland waterways
locks and dams--particularly those on the UMR-IR System--and fully
utilizing the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for its intended purpose of
dredging U.S. ports and harbors.
3,  Foster increased competition among freight railroads and other
transportation modes, provide a better method for challenging
unreasonable rail rates and require railroad carriers to provide
increased access to railroad service data to enhance agricultural
supply chain operations.
4,  Increase motor carrier capacity through regulatory reform and
legislative change.

Thank you for this opportunity to provide information that will be
used to prepare a report for President Biden on supply chains for the
industrial base. We believe our responses provide ideas to support
supply chain policies that will allow U.S. farmers, ranchers, commodity
handlers, processors, and food manufacturers to reliably deliver high-
quality, cost-effective products to domestic and global consumers.
We look forward to working with you to support U.S. agriculture's
adoption of resilient, diverse, and secure supply chain practices.

Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me start with
Mr. Cordero.
I read last week there were nearly 60,000 shipping
containers sitting at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.
That is enough containers to stretch the entire State of
Arkansas on Interstate 40, just for perspective. You say that
these ports have recently implemented a container excess dwell
fee that increases in $100 increments per container per day,
starting on day 9 for trucking companies, day 6 for rail
companies.
Since the implementation of the container excess dwell fee,
how much money has been collected from the carriers?
Mr. Cordero. Well, thank you, Ranking Member, for your
question.
With regard to the fee that is in question, we have not
moved forward to collect a fee as of yet. But I will say this.
I think it is a fair representation to make that, as a result
of that collaboration with our stakeholders, and this button
that we needed to press to get them to the table--I am
referring to the carriers--we have had very good collaboration,
in terms of being able to reduce loaded import containers that
have been at these terminals 9 days or more, just to get the
context here.
Mr. Crawford. So, by letting them know that we are going to
fine you, then you have started to move containers. Is that
what I am hearing from you?
Mr. Cordero. Yes. So, I think we have some----
Mr. Crawford. OK. So how would you spend the money that you
collect on these fines? How would that be spent?
Mr. Cordero. Well, number one, this actually was not meant
as a revenue enhancer, by no means. What the----
Mr. Crawford. OK, because you stated earlier in your
testimony that there were billions of dollars authorized in the
so-called bipartisan transportation infrastructure bill. So,
certainly, you don't need any more money. So, it sounds to me
like what we are trying to do here is just sort of leverage a
little bit of authority to move things along a little more
swiftly. Is that the case?
Mr. Cordero. Well, I think, again, it is fair to say that
the carriers have responded, and we haven't had a reduction at
the port complex here, as much as----
Mr. Crawford. OK.
Mr. Cordero [continuing]. Percentile, with regard to those
containers that were----
Mr. Crawford. Let's talk about that with the carriers. I
would like to move--I appreciate your comments. I would like to
move to Mr. Spear, president of the American Trucking
Associations.
It is safe to say you interact with truckers on a pretty
regular basis. Is that not correct, Mr. Spear?
Mr. Spear. Almost daily, Congressman.
Mr. Crawford. Excellent. So, what kind of costs do you
anticipate, with the implementation of fees like this, that Mr.
Cordero just described?
Mr. Spear. Well, it is just another layer that we are going
to have to bear. I don't think that is a good solution.
It is just one chokepoint of many, and if you can stay open
24/7, you just got to have more people putting in the time at
those ports to move those containers. And so----
Mr. Crawford. On that score, Mr. Spear, let me ask you
this. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but my time is limited.
But on that score, as I said, you talk to trucking companies
and truckers on the daily. Are you telling us that there is not
a shortage of truckdrivers, as has been suggested by some?
Mr. Spear. There is a shortage, and a shortage across every
sector of the economy. We are not exempt from that. We have had
a shortage coming into the pandemic. It is nothing new to us.
Mr. Crawford. OK.
Mr. Spear. It is space at the yards. If you got that many
containers empty and full, you don't have enough room to move
them. So, staging these outside the ports and other open areas,
it is probably a wise move right now. It is just not enough
room to move this stuff. So, it is just so condensed into a
fine area that the throughput is really causing the problem.
So, penalizing people isn't going to speed it up, in my
opinion.
Mr. Crawford. So, assessing fines and fees associated with
that is probably just going to be exacerbating the problem with
inflation, is that what you would suggest?
Mr. Spear. I don't think it does anything, Congressman. I
really don't. You need space. You need throughput. You need
more hours being put in to move these boxes, either on a rail
or onto the chassis. We have got a chassis shortage. You have
got container displacement.
Mr. Crawford. Yes.
Mr. Spear. The problems are plenty, but you need more room.
And it is just bottlenecked there. So, fining people for it is
not going to speed it up, in my view.
Mr. Crawford. OK. In the time that I have remaining, Mr.
Correll, can you describe your last visit to a trucking
terminal, or to a port?
Mr. Correll. Well, thank you, sir. I have never been to a
port. My last visit to a trucking terminal would be, just by
memory, probably about a year ago.
Mr. Crawford. A year ago? What about a rail yard?
Mr. Correll. Never, sir.
Mr. Crawford. So, to a large degree, your analysis is in
the abstract, so you don't really interact with the relevant
stakeholders regarding the issues that we are discussing. Is
that correct?
Mr. Correll. No, I wouldn't agree with that, sir. I
frequently communicate with truckdrivers, their management. But
as far as physical visits to the locations you mentioned, you
are right, I have not been there in quite a while.
Mr. Crawford. All right, thank you. I yield back.
Mr. DeFazio. OK, I thank the gentleman. I can't see who is
next in the queue, I wasn't given a list. And I believe----
Ms. Norton. It is me, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. DeFazio. OK, all right, Eleanor. Eleanor, you are
recognized.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this important
hearing on the supply chain dilemma we face. My first question
is to Mr. Spear.
Mr. Spear, your testimony calls for increased workforce
recruitment among 18- to 20-year-old truckdrivers to address
the shortage. But I am also interested in hearing your thoughts
on workforce retention among the existing pool of commercial
drivers, in light of this 90-percent turnover rate, because
that could happen to 18- to 20-year-olds, too, if you were
given that, as requested.
Drivers are paid by the mile, which means they are not
compensated for hours in long lines. In light of recent
challenges in the supply chain, does the trucking industry plan
to improve worker conditions and driver pay in order to
incentivize driver retention?
Mr. Spear. Yes, Congresswoman. The number that you cited,
the 90 percent, is accurate. But I want to qualify that,
because it is really limited to the hardest segment of our
industry, which is the long haul. And this is the long haul,
where you are gone 3 or 4 weeks at a time. You have got a wife
or a husband. You have got kids at home. That is a long time to
be away. And so, the retention rate at the long-haul segment of
our industry is actually going to be much, much higher than
elsewhere in the industry. But that is the number that is high,
and everybody likes to cite it. But I do want to qualify that.
And it is a problem, but that is the hardest sector, and that
is why. It is lifestyle issues, more time with family----
Ms. Norton. And it is where the supply chain problem is.
Mr. Spear. Well, it is certainly compounding the problem,
but it has always been a problem. This was a problem before the
supply chain was in focus, even before the pandemic.
So, pay has gone up higher in this segment than any other
segment within our industry. And they are still not coming
back. So, it does suggest to us, Congresswoman, that there are
other problems at play here.
There are lifestyle issues. We have got to do a better job
of taking care of our own, especially with healthcare and
wellness programs, but retirement incentives, keeping them in
the saddle longer, knowing that, if they retire here, they are
going to do well.
Look, this is a good-paying job. And on the long haul, you
can probably earn more than anywhere else in the industry,
because you are away so much. But we have got drivers earning
$75,000 to $100,000 a year with full benefits in that segment,
without a college degree and all the debt that comes with it.
So, they are good-paying jobs. It could be higher, but there
are a lot of other factors I am telling you that we have got to
focus in on: the wellness programs, the healthcare, the
retirement incentives. These are all things that we have got to
do if we are going to bring that retention rate down in the
long-haul segment.
Ms. Norton. That is helpful to hear.
Mr. Cordero, the Port of Long Beach has expanded its hours
as much as possible, 24 hours, 7 days a week. That is all you
can do. Yet the trucking industry still struggles to make use
of these expanded hours to pick up loaded containers because of
the shortage of space inundated with empty containers.
Could you elaborate on the restrictions that limit when and
where these empty shipping containers can be returned to ports?
What can be done in the short term to return empty
containers more quickly, and free, therefore, crucial
transportation equipment needed to pick up loaded cargo, Mr.
Cordero?
Mr. Cordero. Well, thank you, Madam Congressmember. Let me
make three points.
Let's all recognize that, as has been stated, we are in a
national crisis with the supply chain. And in fact, it is a
global crisis. So, I think--I wanted to make one point--is that
the fragility of the supply chain has come up now, because of
this unprecedented and unforeseen event that we have, the
health pandemic. So, my point is that, even in normal times,
the issues that we are discussing this morning are the issues
that we were discussing in normal times, in terms of----
[Audio malfunction.]
Mr. Cordero [continuing]. And the truckdrivers. So, to your
question, I think what the Port of Long Beach has done, we have
now allocated almost 100 acres of space here, within the port,
to stage containers to help with this scenario.
And number two, I thoroughly support what Mr. Spear was
representing with regard to the plight of the truckdrivers
because, again, in normal times--in normal times--we have
truckdrivers waiting 2 hours to get into a terminal. We cannot
tolerate that model any longer. Thus, the reason for the 24/7
framework discussion, to distribute the volume.
And let me say this. The 20 million containers, TEU
containers at this port complex, is expected to move now for
year 2021. That is not a surprising amount. That was forecasted
back in 2010. What is surprising is the event that now has
brought these issues to surface.
So, I think, again, there is a lot of legitimacy here with
regard to what you are hearing about the truck driving industry
and the truckdrivers. So, we do need to find ways for them to
be able to increase their earnings, make more truck turn times,
and have gates available to them so that, again, we could have
more fluidity, in terms of how we move this cargo, at least as
it relates to the trucking sector component.
Ms. Norton. Thank you.
Mr. DeFazio. I thank the gentleman, I thank the gentlelady.
At this point, two things. I am going to enter into the
record, with unanimous consent, an OOIDA Foundation statement
on flaws in the driver shortage narrative.
Without objection, so ordered.
[The information follows:]

Statement of the OOIDA Foundation, Submitted for the Record by
Hon. Peter A. DeFazio
OOIDA Foundation Statement on Flaws in Driver Shortage Narrative
Numerous media outlets in recent months have sought to cover
various issues impacting the trucking industry, including the notion of
a chronic and persistent driver shortage. Much of the discussion
surrounding this issue stems from several statements released by the
American Trucking Association (ATA) suggesting that the industry is
short about 80,000 drivers and could surpass 160,000 drivers by 2030. A
careful review of the facts however paints a completely different
picture, one that is marked by retention issues and, at times, an
unattractive working environment due in large part to long hours and
inadequate compensation.
ATA's stance on the driver shortage issue centers upon their own
analysis. As far as the OOIDA Foundation (OOFI) can determine, this is
the only report which attempts to substantiate the belief of a
shortage. Thus it is imperative to examine these reports in order to
verify ATA's claims. This is easier said than done as ATA provides no
substantial methodology for how they arrive at their figures. Instead,
we are left with a few vague paragraphs, making it utterly impossible
for OOFI, or any outside researcher, to validate or invalidate ATA's
conclusions. Thus in response, OOFI has collected information from
various articles and reports emanating outside of OOFI speaking on the
notion of a driver shortage. It is important to note that the data
presented below is hardly exhaustive. We conclude through this evidence
that there is no shortage of drivers, but rather there is a high
turnover rate in particular segments of the industry.
Basic Economics: Is There Really A Truck Driver Shortage?
In May 2021, Greg Rosalsky, a writer and reporter at NPR's Planet
Money, published an article emphasizing how basic economics can shed
light on the supposed driver shortage. The following was taken directly
from Mr. Rosalsky's article: \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2021/05/25/999784202/is-
there-really-a-truck-driver-shortage

``The lobbying organization for the nation's big trucking
employers, the American Trucking Associations (ATA), has been
making this argument since the 1980s, yet store shelves somehow
remained stocked. In a capitalist system, where you can pay
people to do basically anything, how is it even possible to
have a worker shortage for multiple decades?
In a 2019 study published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics, economists Stephen V. Burks and Kristen Monaco
investigated claims by industry leaders that the trucking labor
market was somehow ``broken'' enough to create a decades-long
shortage. Standard economics says if you don't have enough
workers, you raise wages and within a reasonable amount of
time, presto, no more shortage. Is trucking somehow different?
A thorough investigation led them to conclude that the trucking
labor market is not different. It is not broken. Yes, they say,
the trucking labor market is ``tight''--meaning that companies
are competing to fill open jobs--but it functions in the same
way as any other labor market.''

ATA, as well as other large truck lobbying organizations, have been
claiming a driver shortage for decades. In 2000, the Truckload Carriers
Association petitioned the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
(FMCSA) to lower the federal Commercial Driver's License (CDL) age
requirement to 18, citing a driver shortage as the primary reason for
their effort. In the nearly 20 years since the petition, there has
never been a significant disruption in the delivery of goods by truck
due to a lack of drivers and hundreds of thousands of new CDLs have
been issued each year. Over this time, driver compensation has remained
relatively stagnant, failing to increase at a rate that even reflects
inflation.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ https://trucksafety.org/letter-opposing-wheel-act-drive-safe-
act/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The authors of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report
concluded that the view of a long-standing shortage of drivers is
puzzling considering empirical labor economics. They found that ``the
market for truck drivers works about as well as that for other blue-
collar occupations, and that, broadly speaking, we should expect that
if wages rise when the labor market for truck drivers is too tight, the
potential for any long-term shortages will be ameliorated.\3\'' In
fact, according to the report, driver employment is actually stable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2019/article/is-the-us-labor-
market-for-truck-drivers-broken.htm?mod=article_inline
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The true issue is not a driver shortage but driver retention, which
is why the Secretary of the Department of Transportation Pete Buttigieg
hosted a roundtable in July on truck driver recruitment and
retention.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/secretary-pete-
buttigieg-and-secretary-marty-walsh-host-roundtable-trucking-industry

``According to the ATA's own statistics, the average annual
turnover rate for long-haul truckers at big trucking companies
has been greater than 90% for decades. That means, for example,
if a company has ten truckers, nine will be gone within a year;
or, equivalently, three of their driver positions have to each
be refilled three times in a single year because so many new
drivers leave within a few months.\5\''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2021/05/25/999784202/is-
there-really-a-truck-driver-shortage

The BLS report found that truck driver employment was associated
with driver compensation, and that the current supply of drivers is
more than adequate to respond to the overall growth in demand. The
chart below helps to demonstrate this correlation by depicting a more
significant increase or decrease in the number of truck drivers in
comparison to the percentage of wage increases starting in April 2020.
Again, the authors of the BLS report concluded that though the market
tends to be tight, it imposes no constraints on entry into (or exit
from) the occupation. ``There is thus no reason to think that, given
sufficient time, driver supply should fail to respond to price signals
in the standard way.''

OOFI suggests that if large trucking companies would spend more
resources addressing the most serious issues from the perspective of
the driver, then perhaps they might be able to improve driver
retention. Every year the American Transportation Research Institute
(ATRI) releases the top critical issues in trucking. In their report,
ATRI highlights the stark contrast between those issues which drivers
face and those issues which motor carriers face.

Employment: There Is No Truck Driver Shortage
In November 2021, Quartz, a news outlet focused upon global
economics, noted that ``the assertion that the US is suffering from the
latest round of a 16-year truck driver shortage is misleading at
best.\6\'' Stating that the real shortage is a lack of good trucking
jobs that can attract and retain workers in a tight market. According
to figures released by FMCSA and the American Association of Motor
Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), states issue more than 450,000 new
commercial driver's licenses every year.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\7\ FMCSA, Regulatory Evaluation of Minimum Training Requirements
for Entry-Level Commercial Motor Vehicle Operators Final Rule, Federal
Motor Carrier Safety Administration (Nov 2016), pg. 39
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Transportation (DOT) published a press release in
July 2021 explaining that the states were issuing an average of 50,000
CDLs per month during the first half of 2021. This figure was 14
percent higher than the monthly average in 2019 and 60 percent higher
than the 2020 monthly average. Moreover, FMCSA granted operating
authority to 92,000 motor carriers in the first six months of 2021, an
increase of 88 percent over the same time period in 2020 and 60 percent
more than the same time period in 2019. This is further supported in
the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' (BTS) release concerning the
unemployment rate for the truck transportation industry \8\ as shown in
the chart below.\9\ All of these figures in combination with ATA's
turnover statistics clearly indicate a driver surplus, not a shortage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ Truck transportation (NAICS 484) includes industries providing
over-the-road transportation of cargo using motor vehicles, such as
trucks and tractor trailers. It does not include support activities for
road transportation, freight transportation arrangement services, the
Postal Service (covered in NAICS 491), or courier services.

From the Industry's Perspective: We Probably Have More Drivers than We
Did Before the Pandemic
In June 2019, FMCSA released an information collection request
(ICR) concerning the estimated burden truck drivers and motor carriers
incur to comply with the Agency's reporting and recordkeeping
requirements to maintain driver qualification (DQ) files. The Agency
ultimately decided to increase its estimated burden primarily because
``the number of CMV drivers and the frequency of their hiring have
increased since the Agency's 2016 estimate of this burden.\10\'' FMCSA
further stated that, ``The increase in burden hours is primarily the
result of a larger driver population and a higher driver turnover rate,
both of which affect the volume of documents produced and filed in DQ
files.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\10\ https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-06-10/pdf/2019-
12169.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OOFI agrees with FMCSA's assessment, as well as many other
stakeholders in the trucking industry, such as FTR's Vice President of
Trucking Avery Vise, Convoy's director of economic research Aaron
Terrazas, and J.B. Hunt's Senior Vice President of Corporate Safety,
Security, and Driver Personnel Greer Woodruff. Each of these
stakeholders provided comments in a recent article in Commercial
Carrier Journal.\11\ We have presented excerpts below:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ https://www.ccjdigital.com/business/article/15114726/driver-
shortage-more-about-excess-freight-than-drivers

``FTR Vice President of Trucking Avery Vise noted that in terms
of sheer driver population, ``we probably have more than we did
before the pandemic'' based on the recovery of headcount in
payroll employment along with a surge in new for-hire carriers
dating back to July 2020.
Aaron Terrazas, director of economic research at digital
freight network Convoy, said he also doesn't subscribe to the
idea that there is a chronic undersupply of drivers, because
almost all relevant labor and payroll data suggests ``trucking
industry employment across the board is close to, or right at,
or slightly above, pre-pandemic levels.''
Similarly, J.B. Hunt Senior Vice President Corporate Safety,
Security and Driver Personnel Greer Woodruff said the driver
issue always comes down relative to supply and demand, and that
it's always seeking equilibrium. ``As long as there's demand
that's outpacing supply then there's an associated cost to the
supply chain,'' he said. ``I happen to believe we have plenty
of drivers. We don't use them very well.''

When asked how the trucking industry could improve its efficiency,
Woodruff explained that carriers could add capacity without adding
drivers or trucks by simply expediting loading and unloading times,
allowing drop-and-hook, adding flexible appointment times and
appointment times that allow for efficient transit and rest time;
working with shippers to accommodate onsite parking; and providing
consistency in loads and lanes--all of which should squeeze more drive
time out of a driver and add capacity into the market.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inefficiency: Problems in the Supply Chain Are due to Excessive
Detention Not a Shortage of Drivers
The inefficiency which the supply chain faces today is not due to a
lack of drivers, but because of increased detention time. Detention
time, or in particular the period that a driver is not paid while he or
she waits to be loaded or unloaded, is an issue of primary concern for
the trucking industry. In a recent survey conducted by OOFI, over 900
respondents expressed their professional opinions and experiences with
detention, many of whom felt that detention time not only impacted
their financial livelihood but that it also negatively impacted safety
on the roadways. As one member stated, ``this is one of the biggest
issues affecting hours of service and safety. Drivers encountering
unexpected long detention, feel forced to drive faster, harder, and
longer to make up for perceived lost time.''
Depending on a motor carrier's type of operation, a driver may
drive up to either 60 hours in seven days or 70 hours in eight days.
Every moment a shipper or receiver holds up a driver at dock, waiting
to load or unload, can wreak havoc on his or her HOS, meaning that
their available drive time is greatly limited. According to the survey
results, a majority of both those who operate under the 60 hour/7 day
rule and those who operate under the 70 hour/8 day rule spend between
12 and 20 hours each week waiting to load and unload their truck. In
other words, those complying with the 60-hour rule spend approximately
20% to 33% of their possible compensated drive time in detention, while
those complying with the 70-hour rule spend 17% to 29% of their drive
time in detention.
Anyone wanting to increase the efficiency of the overall supply
chain must first begin with detention time, not driver shortage.
FreightWaves recently interviewed multiple company executives from
trucking companies servicing major ports in California who dispute the
idea of a driver shortage, saying that they were actually shedding
drivers because of the lack of consistent work due to port congestion
bottlenecks, equipment, and efficiency issues.\13\ One of the
executives, Miguel Silva, president of Intermodal Logistics at the Port
of Oakland, said, ``I have customers calling me daily, telling me to
name my price, that money is no object, but to please, just pull their
containers. I wish it was that simple.'' Another executive told
FreightWaves that his drivers sometimes wait four to six hours to maybe
pull one container per truck each day. Prior to the congestion crisis,
his drivers averaged three to four ``turns'' each day.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wrong Solutions: Under-21 Polices Are Not the Answer
ATA and other large carriers have pushed to lower the federal CDL
driving age requirement from 21 to 18 in an attempt to solve the
supposed driver shortage problem. However, this is the wrong solution
for a problem which does even exist. J.B. Hunt's Greer Woodruff stated
that, based on past risk profiles, lowering the driving age is a
legitimate safety concern, saying, ``I don't necessarily see that
solving the problem.\14\''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\14\ https://www.ccjdigital.com/business/article/15114726/driver-
shortage-more-about-excess-freight-than-drivers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instead, Woodruff suggested a different solution by noting that the
overall industry is averaging between 6.4 and 6.5 hours of actual
driving time out of a possible 11-hours. ``If you could move that
needle to just 8.45, that's a 30% increase in capacity without adding
any drivers or trucks, and that's meaningful. That's over 1,000 drivers
and trucks that would be available to the supply chain if we could find
out how to harness that.\15\''

Mr. DeFazio. And I am now going to yield the chair to
Representative Strickland, who will continue to recognize
Members for their questions for the panel. Thank you.
Ms. Strickland [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I now
recognize Representative Massie for 5 minutes.
Mr. Massie. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
Mr. Correll, since you are from my alma mater, MIT, I have
to ask you at least the first question. Can you tell us--I know
it is very complicated, but could you give us the biggest
single factor contributing to our supply chain issues right
now?
Mr. Correll. Thank you, sir, and honored to have a
conversation with an alum.
I apologize for dodging the question a bit, but I--the
framing that I hope to bring to the conversation is the one
that I have heard in the comments from the previous speakers,
is that it is a complicated mess of issues.
So, I guess, the most helpful thing I can do is to perhaps
offer a framing that at least expresses how I would answer that
question, or how I see the biggest issue, and I think what it
is is that we tend to frame this, to use a television analogy,
kind of like it is a detective show. Like, if we just analyzed
this issue consistently enough, or cleverly enough, we are
going to ID the one culprit.
But I apologize for the maybe off-color reference, but I
don't think it is a detective show. I think it is a reality
weight loss show. We are all just sort of now living with the
consequences and the prioritizations that we have made in
America over years, and over the pandemic. And the only way
that we can do better is to reprioritize in a way that respects
truckdrivers' time, respects truckdrivers' dignity, harmonizes
our systems.
So, that was a long way of saying that I think the biggest
problem is the framing, and the framing is to look for single
culprits when, in fact, it is a mix of causes.
Mr. Massie. Well, let me try another oversimplified
question. If we could do one thing in Congress to alleviate the
supply chain issues that we are seeing right now, policy-wise,
what do you think that could be? Or two or three things.
Mr. Correll. Sure, thank you. To put it broadly, I think
that we should make the supply chain and logistics sector a
high-tech place to work again. So, we are talking a lot about
improving efficiency and utilization. And, in many workplaces,
that just means having access to the latest tools. I think,
oftentimes, our schedulers, our drivers, our warehouse workers
don't always have access to those kinds of tools.
The other advantage of that, I think, is that, as a
lifelong employee myself, one way that employers show me that
they respect my time and my efforts is by giving me a state-of-
the-art workplace that makes the most of the time I give to
them. And so, I think, if the Government could help us make our
warehouses and our supply chains, and particularly the
interface, where trucks come to warehouses, where they gate-in
and gate-out, more sophisticated, and high-tech, and more
respectful of their time and dignity, that would be the most
beneficial move I can imagine.
Mr. Massie. All right. Well, thank you very much. We will
start by trying not to get in the way of private industry,
where they implement those things.
Mr. Regan, is it true the AFL-CIO is suing the Biden
administration to expand the OSHA vaccine mandate to cover more
businesses?
Mr. Regan. Yes, that is correct.
Mr. Massie. Why would you do that?
Mr. Regan. Well, the broader AFL-CIO wants to make sure
that every worker has the protections of an OSHA protection.
This was, again, about the ETS, not about a vaccine mandate.
This was about the OSHA ETS.
Mr. Massie. Some people think it is because employers are
leaving larger, union-based companies that have 100 or more
employees, where those shops are more likely to be unionized
than, say, a small shop. Isn't it true that the AFL-CIO could
lose membership because of this mandate, if it applies only to
100 or more?
Isn't that part of the motivation for making sure that
everybody has to suffer under these mandates, if the companies
100 or more are going to suffer under them?
Mr. Regan. That was certainly not part of the intention of
the lawsuit.
Mr. Massie. Does the AFL-CIO have a formal policy of
supporting religious and medical exemptions, when your members
apply for those?
Mr. Regan. We have a formal policy, of course, of making
sure that our collective bargaining agreements for all of our
unions are being honored in the process of implementing these
mandates and making sure that people are properly protected.
That is our obligation, is through the collective bargaining
process.
Mr. Massie. Does the AFL-CIO support the concept of natural
immunity, or the notion that somebody who has already had COVID
and recovered, maybe because they worked through the pandemic
when others didn't, shouldn't be required to get the vaccine?
Mr. Regan. That issue has not come up. We support everybody
getting vaccinated, and we support making sure that workers are
not harmed in the process.
Mr. Massie. So, given that there is little to no benefit to
getting vaccinated if you have already had COVID and developed
a natural immunity, do you support your workers when they apply
for medical exemptions based on natural immunity?
Mr. Regan. I don't have the medical expertise to determine
whether that is accurate or not.
But again, this issue and the issue we are dealing with
right now is not about the vaccine mandate. We are dealing with
workforce conditions and dealing with problems with our
infrastructure.
Mr. Massie. All right, my time has expired. Thank you,
Madam Chairwoman.
Ms. Strickland. Thank you. I now recognize Representative
Johnson from Texas for 5 minutes.
[Pause.]
Ms. Johnson of Texas. Can you hear me?
Ms. Strickland. We can now, thank you.
Ms. Johnson of Texas. Well, thank you very much. I would
like to ask all of the witnesses, or whomever will respond.
As chairperson of the House Committee on Science, Space,
and Technology, I am really curious to know whether--the State
of Texas has been developing several critical components to
develop spaceports. Do any of you know if there is timely,
impactful strategy to aid in the development of these?
We have probably the largest moving of goods from both
California and Texas in the country. And so, we know that we
are a major, major trade and good movement area.
So, whoever wants to start, I would appreciate it.
[Pause.]
Mr. Correll. I am sorry----
Ms. Strickland. Any of our witnesses? Thank you.
Mr. Correll. I am afraid I didn't follow the question. Was
it about port policy recommendations for Texas?
Ms. Johnson of Texas. Spaceports. We are so large, and very
congested in our major urban areas, that there is some talk and
plan for the spaceports for the--delivering goods. And I
wondered if anyone on the panel has any plan or hearing of a
plan to support this type of transportation.
Mr. Cordero. So, Congresswoman, are you referring to
additional space outside the port authority, like land, so that
we could stage these containers? Is that what you are referring
to?
Ms. Johnson of Texas. Yes.
Mr. Cordero. OK, so thank you, and that is a very good
question.
So, let me answer that question by simply indicating that I
think it is fair to say that ports across the Nation--the
question of what we call inland port connectivity, which
basically means taking the containers out of the port complex,
and moving them to, like, an inland area. And I think that
subject is very apropos, or that question is very apropos,
given the situation that we are in at the current time.
In my comments, I made reference to the fact that the Port
of Savannah, the Georgia Port Authority, is moving in that
direction. For the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, we are
having discussions with regard to the inland port connectivity.
So again, it is very key that, as we continue to advance
reform in the supply chain, of what I call transformational
change in the supply chain, it must include space outside the
immediate port authority to move these containers through
distribution and warehouse regions.
So, again, I think that is a subject matter that is very
much in California being discussed.
So, I think I may have answered your question. I can follow
up with an answer, if you have more specificity on this issue.
Thank you so much.
Ms. Johnson of Texas. Well, thank you. We have a very large
inland port in my district. I am from a very large trade area.
Is there anyone else on the panel who would like to
comment?
Mr. Spear. Yes, I would just----
Mr. Jefferies. Certainly, Congresswoman----
Mr. Spear [continuing]. Mr. Cordero's comments, that that
was what I was alluding to earlier about getting those
containers, both full and empty, out of the condensed space of
the port, and into other open areas, where we can logistically
move them more quickly. So, I think that is exactly what you
are alluding to. I think that is a very good interim solution
that will improve the throughput.
Your State, obviously, not just your district, your State,
in Texas, has 7 of the top 100 bottlenecks in the country. So,
you are very familiar with congestion. And it was there long
before this pandemic. So, it has compounded now, as a result of
that, and we need to get innovative about how we reposition and
move freight more efficiently. So, more space, clearly, is a
solution for that, at least in the interim, possibly even long-
term.
Mr. Jefferies. Congresswoman, I would certainly reiterate
those points from the rail perspective. Rail is a vital part of
Texas, and certainly there are a colossal amount of goods
moving by rail in and throughout Texas. And we feel that rail
is really well positioned. When you have on-dock rail, you can
put upwards of 200-plus containers, and get them out of the
port, out of that immediate congestion inland, into a yard
where perhaps it is closer to final destination, and our
trucking partners can take the final leg of the trip there.
So, that is absolutely spot on, something we are supportive
of, something we are very active in, including the State of
Texas and throughout the country, and something we need to keep
a focus on, moving forward. So, absolutely, great question.
Ms. Johnson of Texas. Thank you. Anyone else?
Ms. Reinke. I would just say, Congresswoman, anything that
expands capacity is something that would benefit the supply
chain and our members. So, thank you.
Ms. Johnson of Texas. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and
I will yield back.
Ms. Strickland. Thank you.
And as a reminder to those of us here in this room, we are
required to wear masks, unless we are sipping a beverage or
speaking. So please adhere to that.
I now recognize Representative Davis for 5 minutes.
Mr. Rodney Davis. Well, thank you, Madam Chair.
First off, I am really intrigued by the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em
Robots that are behind you in your frame, Ms. Reinke. Are you
going to bring those in for a hearing in person at some point?
Ms. Reinke. Sure, at your request. Yes, sir.
Mr. Rodney Davis. We might be able to solve some problems
here in Congress, with a couple of games of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em
Robots, right?
Well, bring it in for us, we would love to mess around with
it.
Ms. Reinke. I will get it out of eyeshot for the next time.
Mr. Rodney Davis. Oh no, no. Keep it there. We enjoy it.
But my questions are first going to be for Mr. Spear.
Mr. Spear, there have been complaints that dwell time, the
amount of time that equipment is out on the street before being
returned for another move, for containers and chassis, is
actually increasing. If dwell times today in the Los Angeles-
Long Beach Basin are two to three times the historical levels,
which is what has been reported, how does that reduce freight
fluidity?
Mr. Spear. Well, it is complicating it. And again, a lot of
this, too, is the condensed space in the ports, where it is
bottlenecking. You have a flood of these containers coming in.
We have container displacement, full and empty. We talked about
that.
But we also have a chassis shortage. And chassis choice is
a big issue for our industry. We are actually litigating in
that space, to make certain that motor carriers have the
ability to have choice in that, and not be pushed into a
particular product that they have to use. So, more choice is
something that we are arguing for, and I think we will prevail
on that front.
But coming into this pandemic, and now with the supply
chain wait, this is a chokepoint, and it is occurring right at
the port. So, the chassis shortage is really a problem that is
increasing our ability--or inability, I guess--to improve on
turn times.
Mr. Rodney Davis. Well, what can be done to ensure that
equipment is returned more quickly, so that we can reduce these
dwell times and increase the fluidity?
I mean is the ports' push to get containers off the
terminal, and stage empty containers at off-dock locations
helping with equipment availability?
Mr. Spear. Well, certainly, given our motor carriers, the
choice of their own equipment would help. That would certainly
increase the amount of equipment out there to be used.
And second, I think giving access to these ports with
independent contractors, they have been pushed out. Owner-
operators aren't allowed in. So, this is a problem. And so, we
have got to suspend some of these rules, I would say,
permanently. But in a time of crisis, as has been widely
discussed during this hearing, it seems appropriate that we
alleviate some of that, and get the drivers that can come in
that have been barred from operating in these areas. So, that
would certainly help, in terms of increasing turn times.
Mr. Rodney Davis. Well, I appreciate your testimony, Mr.
Spear, and, actually, the testimony of everybody on this panel.
It is very interesting to note that the administration talked
about addressing the supply chain issues at our ports, the two
in particular that I mentioned earlier, but we are just not
seeing the actions that I think are going to solve the problem.
I think we can come up with some better ideas. I have
talked about utilizing TRANSCOM, based at Scott Air Force Base
in Illinois. They can move battalions of weaponry across the
globe to a war zone; I think they might be able to help solve
some of the problems at the Port of Long Beach and the Port of
Los Angeles, just to name a few.
But I do want to let the witnesses know, especially Mr.
Jefferies, I was being called earlier, when I was asking
questions, by my colleague, Garret Graves. And I tried to
remain as stoic as you did when I was doing the exact same
thing to you during your testimony earlier today. So congrats,
my friend, and I don't have any questions for anyone else. I am
going to yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. Strickland. Thank you. I now call on Representative
Larsen for 5 minutes.
Mr. Larsen. Thank you. Mr. Spear, based on Representative
Davis' questions, do you have any ideas about increasing
production of chassis as a solution? And how would that occur?
Mr. Spear. Well, this is a complicated matter, as we have,
obviously, had trade from countries like China provide that
equipment. That has existed for quite a long time now. With the
tariffs in place, that production has now had to shift to the
U.S., and that was occurring right before the pandemic had hit,
and all these problems we are describing within the supply
chain. So, it is a compounding problem. It is a shift in
production, back to the U.S., and building that capacity here,
domestically. If that is the case, that is what is going to
have to happen.
So, like many things beyond chassis, we have got a chip
shortage. Microchips, obviously, are not just for cars, but
they are also for trucks. And they are both less profitable in
cars and trucks than they are in the phones that we have, or
our iPads, and so on. They are more profitable in that hand-
held equipment than they are in a car or a truck. And so,
productivity and the economics of supply and sourcing are
causing a problem. It is just another illustration, no
different than the chassis themselves.
So, repositioning and shifting production back to the U.S.
is something that--if that has got to happen, it is what it is
going to take to get the chassis available that we are going to
need to meet the demand.
Mr. Larsen. Yes, thank you.
Mr. Cordero, your testimony mentions that some terminals at
the Port of Long Beach are exploring that framework for 24/7
operations. You mentioned this earlier, I think, in response to
earlier questions. But can you expand a little bit on what is
the status of that framework?
And can other ports use this framework? I have got, nearby,
the Ports of Seattle and Tacoma.
Mr. Cordero. Thank you for your question, Congressmember.
Number one, the Port of Long Beach has a pilot project with
one of our terminals, Total Terminals International. It is a
24/7 pilot project. And what we are doing right now is we are
having a robust conversation with many of the stakeholders, the
beneficial cargo owners, the truckers, and the railroads. As
one witness has already indicated, the railroads are totally in
on the 24/7 movement. But the whole point is it is a beginning
of a framework.
Like I indicated, we need transformational change in major
container gateways. And, of course, here in southern
California, and your ports, Tacoma, Seattle, up in the
Northwest--but for southern California, again, when you move 20
million containers, that number is not going to get any less
after this crisis is over.
Mr. Larsen. Yes.
Mr. Cordero. I think the whole purpose is, again, this is a
great time and--to use a cliche--crisis brings opportunities,
and we have an opportunity to transform our model, how we
operate here, in terms of the movement of container cargo.
Mr. Larsen. And presumably longshore is part of that
conversation.
Mr. Cordero. They are, and I could represent to you that
longshore labor is ready. They are supportive, and it is just a
question of, again, taking--you just can't flip a switch and
change this model today. But the good news, there is a lot of
conversation in terms of that being the objective.
Mr. Larsen. Yes. On a recent study of ports in Washington
State and in California--including your port, I think--found
that, during the period of 2016 to 2020, ports in British
Columbia received $372 million in direct Canadian Federal
funding, compared to $45 million in Washington, and $179
million in California.
Are the Federal funding mechanisms for ports meeting
current demand, and how will the infrastructure bill close that
gap?
Mr. Cordero. Well, first of all, it is welcome news for
port authorities to have an infrastructure bill that--again, in
the best interest of the Nation, something we needed for
decades. And it is even more comforting that we have $17
billion earmarked for ports and waterways. So, it is a very
good step in the direction that we need to take.
As you reference, our competitors, whether it is Asia,
whether it is Canada, whether it is Mexico, not only have a lot
more infrastructure investment, but, more specifically, a
national freight policy, which--again, this is another matter I
wanted to bring to the attention of the committee, how
important that would be.
So, suffice it to say that again, $17 billion is welcome
news, but going forward, we can't stop when this crisis is
over. We need to continue to invest in our port and maritime
industry, because we all know how essential this operation is,
to the point where what--why we are having this hearing, is
because of the impact it has had, not only to our commercial--
--
Mr. Larsen. Yes, thank you.
Mr. Cordero [continuing]. Exporters----
Mr. Larsen. It is----
Mr. Cordero [continuing]. And the economy.
Mr. Larsen. Yes, and Madam Chair, just a point of personal
privilege, if I could just communicate to Mr. Cordero to let
his spouse know today there are two ships at anchorage in
Holmes Harbor, not three. So, we are making progress.
Mr. Cordero. Thank you for helping the marriage,
Congressman.
Mr. Larsen. Thank you.
Ms. Strickland. Thank you, Rep. Larsen. I now recognize
Representative Babin for 5 minutes.
Dr. Babin. Thank you, Madam Chair. I really appreciate the
chairman and the ranking member for having this hearing. It is
one of the most important topics right now under our
committee's jurisdiction, because of the supply chain effects
and its effects on every single American in the most tangible
way.
So much happens in the world that we don't feel or,
frankly, even know about. But, as we have seen, when our supply
chain is interrupted, the ripple effect is felt in every store,
on every shelf, and in every pocketbook. And like my colleagues
before me have said, there isn't one solution. This is a very
complex and convoluted problem made up of many, many variables.
We will need to work together to end this crisis, and I hope
and pray that we do.
But I do know one thing for sure: President Biden and my
friends on the other side of the aisle are certainly not
helping the problem by spending trillions that we don't have,
creating more burdensome regulations, implementing vaccine
mandates, and increasing taxes in a whopping way. And with that
I would like to ask Mr. Spear from the ATA a question.
Mr. Spear, last week the White House announced a series of
moves intended to alleviate port congestion and supply chain
shortages. The administration noted an ``assessment of truck
parking facilities'' as part of this effort.
And as a former truckdriver myself, I was very interested
to see that in 2013 the initial Jason's Law Truck Parking
Survey indicated parking shortages were a national safety
concern--2013, that is. A pending updated Jason's Law survey is
expected to reveal many of the same conclusions, including that
parking shortages are still a major problem in every State and
region, and challenges exist in funding and maintaining parking
in both the public and private sectors.
Truckers all across my district tell me all the time that
they are sick of studies and reports that all draw the very
same conclusions: that there is a truck parking crisis in
America. So, in your opinion, is yet another assessment the
best use of Government resources to solve this truck parking
crisis?
Mr. Spear. We know the problem, Congressman, you just
outlined it. I mean, we have got 3\1/2\ million truckdrivers in
this country, and that is our number, and that is a valid
number. And you have got 313,000 truck parking spaces,
nationally, and that is according to the report you just cited.
So, we know that problem, that is well measured, that is well
defined. But do the math. That is for every 11 truckdrivers
there is 1 truck parking space. This is a problem.
And we keep adding layers, in terms of the rest breaks they
have got to take, and there is no place to take them. I mean,
you can drive just north of DC, here on I-95, and you will see
multiple trucks parked on the shoulders. It is dangerous. It is
dangerous to them, it is dangerous to the motoring public. And
so, hopefully, the IIJA provides more moneys in there.
But, as was in the House-passed bill, $1 billion for truck
parking wasn't included in the IIJA. So, the money is given to
the Secretary, our discretionary. I sure hope that they are
looking at this problem and----
Dr. Babin. Absolutely.
Mr. Spear [continuing]. And allocating some of that money
for this problem, because it really is a crisis, and it is
something that we have got to solve. So, we strongly support
that.
Dr. Babin. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. And with
the remainder of my time, I would like to ask a question of Mr.
Cordero.
Mr. Cordero, for your awareness, I have the privilege of
representing the Port of Houston, as well as the Houston Ship
Channel, which is the busiest deep draft waterway in the Nation
and has more than 200,000 annual barge movements.
After working closely with the Trump administration to
secure authorization appropriation and a New Start designation,
the port just broke ground on Project 11, which will deepen and
widen the Houston Ship Channel, and create more efficient
waterways for vessels, improving storm resiliency and
bolstering the port's economic impact.
But with all this growth, we still will need more jobs. We
need more labor forces. And with the current labor shortage,
thanks to vaccine mandates and the extension of Federal
unemployment benefits, how can we make sure that there will be
a technically trained labor market to sufficiently fill those
gaps?
Mr. Cordero. Well, thank you for your question,
Congressman.
And again, my----
Dr. Babin. Yes, sir.
Mr. Cordero [continuing]. Good friend Mr. Guenther at the
Port of Houston has done a great job over there, at the Port of
Houston.
To your question, the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles,
we are collaborating and moving forward with a work training
center here that is going to be a changing dynamic, in terms of
how we train that workforce.
So, as you have indicated, and as some commentators have
already made, this industry is not immune from the whole issue
about the labor force across the country affecting many
sectors. But for the port industry, we recognize that, again,
there has to be a lot of work done in work development, work
enforcement here, in terms of workforce development. And that
is what we are doing here, at the Ports of Long Beach and Los
Angeles.
So, in that regard, I also want to pitch the importance of
digital transformation, and making sure we have the funds for
the workforce of the future, in terms of how important that is
going to be, with regard to creating greater efficiencies here
at our ports, here in America.
Dr. Babin. Thank you very much, and I will yield back,
because I am out of time.
Ms. Strickland. Thank you. I now recognize Representative
Johnson of Georgia for 5 minutes.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Madam Chair, for holding
this hearing, and thank you to the witnesses for your time and
your testimony.
The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically exposed the
vulnerability of global supply chains, and today millions of
Americans are discovering half-empty store shelves, longer
delivery times, and increasingly expensive consumer goods.
Supply chain issues stem from several factors, including an
extraordinary surge in demand for goods and factory shutdowns
abroad. However, the situation is compounded by deteriorating
working conditions for truckdrivers and the negative effects of
climate change. Only by addressing the vulnerabilities in our
system can we revitalize our global supply chain
infrastructure.
Mr. Regan, your testimony indicates that so-called labor
shortages are insufficient to explain the current supply chain
dynamics. You argue that the failure of employers to respond to
market conditions and provide incentives to workers, such as
quality wages, benefits, working conditions, and the like,
undermine the workforce. How would you characterize working
conditions of long-haul truckdrivers, and what changes need to
be made to increase driver retention in the trucking industry?
Mr. Regan. Thank you for the question, sir. Again, I think
one of the major issues facing the truck driving workforce has
to do with workforce misclassification. You have a lot of
situations where they are not directly employed by the trucking
companies, they are independently contracted out, they are
leasing the equipment. In some cases, that drastically reduces
their pay and their incentive to stay in the workforce.
My friends at the Teamsters Union, who represent far more
truckers than I do, have said a lot about this subject. But, in
general, this is an issue that has showed a continual decline
in the workforce in the trucking industry.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. The current situation
has renewed calls by Mr. Spear and others to allow drivers ages
18 to 21 to operate trucks interstate to address the driver
shortage or an inability of motor carriers to attract and
retain drivers. Do you have concerns with the safety of
allowing 18- to 21-year-olds to drive trucks interstate?
Mr. Regan. Yes, I think there are safety concerns there.
But, I know that in the IIJA that was just passed, there is an
authorization of a pilot program to allow this, which,
hopefully, will allow us to understand what the shortcomings or
what the benefits of this will be. And they are going to be
able to assess whether this is a viable solution, moving
forward.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you.
Mr. Cordero, your testimony indicates that the Georgia
Ports Authority is addressing backlogs by easing congestion,
such as clearing up space to unload containerships more
efficiently. This is possible due to cooperation with the White
House and Department of Transportation, which announced that
ports would be able to repurpose unspent grant funds from past
projects to address supply chain congestion. In fact, the
Georgia Ports Authority will spend $8 million from past grants
for this project.
In addition to these changes, how can the Georgia Ports
Authority build resilience against future shocks to the supply
chain?
Mr. Cordero. Well, again, I think, also, I would like to
acknowledge my good friend, Griff Lynch at the Port Authority
there, at Savannah, on these issues.
So, I think, again, what we need to do is that, in the port
connectivity across the Nation, that is going to be very
important.
And I think also, my colleague there has also referenced
extended gate hours. In fact, you referenced that commentary a
couple of years back at a conference in New York.
But again, I think the main point here is we need to create
fluidity here in the supply chain, and it has to be a supply
chain issue. It is not just a port authority or a terminal.
And again, going forward, digital transformation is going
to be very important, in terms of how we use technology with
regard to further transparency and visibility in the movement
of cargo. I can represent that all port authorities here are
looking in that same subject matter. But at this point, there
is no single reason that we could point to to solve the current
crisis that we are in. Again, this is a global crisis.
But suffice it to say that the good news is we are moving
the cargo, the men and women who are working at these ports
across America are moving the cargo. They are essential
workers. And as noted, one reason for the situation is the
economy that we are looking to, the 6-percent GDP growth for
this year, and consumers are buying more than ever. So, I think
it is a confluence of factors.
But to your question, I think those are some areas that
port authorities, again, can continue to move forward to
transform the supply chain.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, and I yield back.
Ms. Strickland. Thank you. I now recognize Representative
Perry for 5 minutes.
Mr. Perry. Thank you, Madam Chair. I've got to say, at the
onset of the hearing, I listened to the chairman go on for
about 5 minutes with a stream of what I consider to be vapid
and incendiary partisan principles and rhetoric, and then, at
the end of it, demand that no one else engage in incendiary
partisan rhetoric. It is incredible to me that somebody can be
in Washington for over 30 years on this committee, and not
understand that Washington isn't the solution, Washington is
the problem.
With that, I mean, I certainly appreciate the fact that the
majority has finally woken up to the fact that there is a
supply chain crisis. But I can't help but lament the fact that
this hearing comes in the wake of the Socialists on both sides
of the aisle, pumping another $1.25 trillion into our economy,
without any consideration of the inflationary impacts of these
policies during a time of record inflation.
In fact, I would argue there is a pattern of bipartisan
folly in this committee and this Congress that have not only
contributed to the supply chain crises we see today, but to
seek to actively worsen the situation by, essentially, pouring
gasoline on that fire, seeking to add unnecessary and
destructive environmental and labor restrictions that kill the
ability of the hard-working Americans to deliver the goods
needed by their fellow citizens.
One of the contributing factors that has resulted in the
supply chain crisis is the oppressive regulatory environment in
California, and the destructive impacts it has had on the
workforce in that State. There is absolutely no question
California's ports have been hit hardest here. But the majority
and their supporters on our side of the aisle desperately seek
to divert the attention away from the true reason why that is
the case, as they seek to bring California-style regulation,
poverty, and destruction across the rest of the Nation. That is
a great plan.
California has actively sought to kill the trucking
industry in its State, and the oppressive hand of the State
government has led to many truckers to abandon routes within
the State, whether it is CARB's unnecessary economically
destructive regulations, or AB5, which effectively outlaws
owner-operators by redefining ``employee'' to end independent
contractors, in order to ensure big labor bosses can organize a
wider swath of the workforce without putting in any work.
Outlawing independent truckers is essentially what they
did, and we are sitting here talking about solutions to a
truckdriver shortage and supply chain problems, and we don't
even bring it up. It is incredible to me.
Unfortunately, the Biden administration, the Socialist
majority, and their fellow travelers in our party aren't
seeking ways to alleviate the destruction caused by these
policies. They are seeking to nationalize it. The PRO Act would
bring an AB5-style war on independent contractors into Federal
law, destroying the businesses of nearly 350,000 to 400,000
owner-operators in the U.S. trucking workforce. Oh, that sounds
like a great solution. Washington is right on cue to be there
to help.
Unfortunately, every single Democrat and four Republicans
on this committee voted in order to do this, despite repeated
warnings by the trucking industry that we are currently
experiencing a trucker shortage, without taking hundreds of
thousands of qualified drivers off the road to appease the big
labor bosses and these Members' support over their
constituents' best interests. Appalling.
Mr. Spear, what would be the impact on the trucking
workforce if the owner-operator model was banned overnight, as
the majority and some of my Republican colleagues seek to do?
What would be the impact?
Mr. Spear. You are just going to see it continue to inflate
the problem, our inability to get goods to the shelves. Your
constituents, and constituents across every district in this
country are going to go from eight apples down to three, maybe
even two. OK, that is just choice, and it is going to go away,
because you have fewer people to drive it.
Over 80 percent of the communities in this country are
exclusively dependent on trucks for their goods. You got to
have a driver behind it. So, unless we are going to go
driverless tomorrow, you are going to have to attract and
retain talent to do it. You are going to need owner-operators,
you are going to need independent contractors.
The only reason that this whole reclassification debate is
even out there is because they want to organize it. But if you
go and talk to an independent contractor, they are going to
tell you, ``Hey, I chose this. No one put a gun to my head. OK?
I chose this occupation because I wanted more time at home.''
It is seasonal work, it is part-time work. Whatever the reason
is, they chose it. And they want to take choice away from these
folks. They don't want them to have that option, because they
want to organize, and they want them part of the union.
Well, they don't want to be part of the union. And if they
do want to be part of the union, they can join the union. No
one is telling them either way. They can do either one, but it
is their choice. We are going to win that in the Supreme Court.
They just asked the Solicitor General to look at that, which
means, to me, that they are serious about taking up AB5. And I
believe we are going to win that solution, and we will settle
this once and for all.
Mr. Perry. Thank you, Mr. Spear. I couldn't have said it
better myself.
Madam Chair, I yield the balance.
Ms. Strickland. Thank you. I now recognize Representative
Carson for 5 minutes.
Mr. Carson. Thank you, Madam Chair.
After seeing so much congestion at ports, I would like to
get your thoughts on what positive rail might play in
strengthening our supply chain, not just in terms of more
efficient movement of goods and materials, but in improving our
human infrastructure, too.
Precision Scheduled Railroading sounds impressive, but it
seems counterintuitive to plan for longer trains, but smaller
crew sizes. And our transportation systems are really, quite
frankly, I mean, as I like to say, respectfully, they are only
as strong as our people and our workers. And in a place like
Indiana, the crossroads of America, we have to address the
congestion on the roads that, unfortunately, results when
downtown and critical streets are blocked by painfully long
freight trains.
So, how can these disruptions be improved, as we are
working to strengthen our supply chains?
Mr. Jefferies. Well, thank you for that question,
Congressman. There are several aspects to it, so I will try to
take them one by one.
So, I certainly agree with you that we are only as strong
as our people, our employees. And that is why I think we are so
proud of our employees getting the job done over the past 18-
plus months, when most of us were able to work from home.
Railroads didn't stop running. We are a 24/7 operation, and so
thanks to our employees' dedication and commitment to doing
that and doing it safely.
Railroading is absolutely a strong industry for an employee
to spend a career in. Average wages and benefits, over $130,000
a year. It is one of the last remaining industries where an
employee with a high school graduation can support a family and
live a middle-class life with a very strong and comfortable
retirement. And that is why we have employees for several
generations working for decades at a time in our industry.
Now, to your point about congestion, we actually think that
rail is a huge part of solving the congestion problem, writ
large. More goods moving by rail, more containers being on the
back of rail, that is less congestion on the highways, less
wear and tear on the highways. And this is not an anti-truck
statement. Truckers are certainly our big competition, but they
are also our biggest partners. And that is why we are sitting
here together advocating, I think, on a lot of the same
principles.
We have got an integrated supply network, and we have got
to make sure it is functioning as efficiently as possible.
Railroads out of the west coast have capacity right now. We can
take on additional volumes, we can take on additional
containers to get them to the middle of the country, where they
can be distributed to their final destination.
The issue of grade crossings is certainly an area that
absolutely presents challenges for communities, and one that we
do not take lightly. And while every grade crossing is
different, there is certainly no one-size-fits-all answer. A
number of steps can be taken to help alleviate the challenge.
First and foremost, a grade crossing that doesn't exist is
the best one out there. And so, the $3 billion included in the
infrastructure bill that is dedicated solely to grade
separations, a huge effort by Congress to get that across the
finish line, and something that we are very supportive of, very
excited to work with our community partners to put that money
to work, and in the high-profile grade crossings.
But when you can't separate a grade crossing, it is
important to make sure that it has up-to-date safety devices,
up-to-date protection. Again, something that was prioritized in
the infrastructure bill.
From the rail standpoint, what can we do? Well, we can
absolutely look at our operations, and look to minimize the
time that a train is sitting, blocking a crossing, or look at
our hours for when trains are running through communities, to
minimize the impact on peak traffic times.
We can also provide information in advance to motorists.
So, if there is a blocked crossing ahead, you can deploy
dynamic signage to make sure that a motorist is aware that that
blocked crossing is ahead of them, and perhaps there is an
opportunity to reroute.
So, we have got to continue to work on this. It is an
industry priority. I can tell you right now, firsthand, it has
our CEO's attention at the executive level and the industry
level, and it is something that we have got to keep a shoulder
into, as an industry, but also working with our communities.
Mr. Carson. That is great, that is great, thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, I yield back.
Ms. Strickland. Thank you. I now recognize Representative
Weber for 5 minutes.
Mr. Weber of Texas. Thank you, ma'am. This is a question
for Mr. Cordero.
In your materials you say that long-term infrastructure
investment is needed to secure our supply chains. But the
question is, what if the investment comes along with strings
that prohibit us from improving efficiency or installing
automation that would actually help make for a more seamless
supply chain?
And I want to put a couple of caveats in there, Mr.
Cordero. What do you think would hurt building a dependable
supply chain more, would it be a mandate to have to join a
union, or would it be mask mandates? Which of those would you
think is the most egregious?
Mr. Cordero. Well, thank you, Congressman. And I would like
to thank you for your support of the port authorities----
Mr. Weber of Texas. You bet.
Mr. Cordero. As a Member, as you recall, when I was
Chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission, you were very
supportive of ports and, of course, the PORTS Caucus, and your
participation in that.
To your question, I think what is critical now for the
supply chain is how we create efficiencies and reduce costs in
the movement of cargo. We are in a very competitive environment
right now. And, obviously, what this crisis has brought forth,
Congressman, is certainly the issues that we discussed back in
2015. And I am referring to the July 2015 report released by
the Federal Maritime Commission on this very issue: congestion.
So, I think, in this crisis, I think it is fair to say that
no port has essentially closed down, certainly not L.A./Long
Beach, because of this crisis.
I will say that, with regard to the mask and the vaccine
mandate, that has mitigated the impact on the workforce, here
on the docks. Earlier this year, due to the leadership of our
mayor, Robert Garcia, and Governor Gavin Newsom, we moved
forward to make sure those vaccinations were available to the
men and women that worked on the docks. And I will represent I
think that action substantially mitigated the impact on the
labor that we would have had, but for not----
Mr. Weber of Texas. Right, and I would agree with that. But
I think you have got to move that product away from the docks,
and it is going to--I think--I am surprised that the number
quoted was 80 percent. I think, basically, about everything
Americans touch is going to come on a truck somewhere. Not
everybody has a railroad in their backyard, and not everybody
is next to one.
So, I want to go to this question for you and Mr. Spear, as
well, and that is, I ran a hotshot company for about 2 years
before I ran for the State legislature, and I am thoroughly
familiar with USDOT regulations, TxDOT regulations, and did a
lot of stuff, seen a lot of big truckers on the road. Now, with
the shortage of truckdrivers, does it make sense for us to
allow 18- to 21-year-olds to drive?
And maybe this is for you, Mr. Spear: Has the truckdrivers,
the union, the Teamsters, have they taken a position against it
or for it?
Obviously, the military is able to do that, train 18- to
21-year-olds to do it. Has there been a study done? What are
your thoughts, Mr. Spear? A couple of questions there.
Mr. Spear. So, 49 States in the U.S., including yours,
Congressman, allow an 18-year-old to drive a class 8, they just
can't cross State lines.
Mr. Weber of Texas. Right.
Mr. Spear. So, you can go from El Paso to Texarkana and
back, no problem. You just can't cross into Texarkana,
Arkansas, which makes absolutely no sense.
By the way, in those 49 States, there is absolutely no
training and no technology requirements for that equipment for
that 18-year-old. The DRIVE Safe Act, which is bipartisan, both
chambers, and the provisions that were included from that act
in the IIJA, create a national program, 3,000 young people that
we can properly train, up to 400 hours of training, which--240
of those hours you have to have an experienced driver in the
cab with them. You have got to have technology equipment, AEB,
speed controls, anti-collision. All that--cameras have to be on
that equipment. So, this is a step toward safety, not away.
And rightfully to your point, I have got a--my oldest son
is right now at Fort Benning, OK? We are sending 18-, 19-, and
20-year-olds overseas to defend our freedom, do the
unthinkable. And I am pretty sure that, if we can train them
properly to do that, we can teach them how to cross State lines
in a class 8, and that language will get it done. So, I am very
confident we can do this safely and responsibly.
Mr. Weber of Texas. To that point, I will make this
comment, of course. Once they have driven across Texas, they
have already driven across several States, basically.
And has the Teamsters Union taken a position on that
concept?
Mr. Spear. Well, I will defer to Greg on that. It is passed
now in the IIJA, so, we can debate whether they are for or
against, but it is going to happen. Now we need to work with
the agency to get it right. Greg alluded to that. I support
what Greg said. Let's get it right. Let's make certain that we
are not compromising safety. They can responsibly operate this
equipment already. Let's add these conditions to it, and get it
right.
And if we can do that, what we are doing here now is
bringing this young, talented pool into our industry, long
term. That should be good for my industry. That should be good
for the unions. That is more people, long term, they can
recruit from. So, if you look at it through that lens, and you
can do this responsibly, I think it is good policy.
So, wait and see, but I think we got some work to do to get
it right, and I think it will be done right.
Mr. Weber of Texas. Well, thank you for that. I have run
over my time, so I am going to need to yield back. Thank you so
much.
Ms. Strickland. Thank you. I now recognize Representative
Titus for 5 minutes.
Ms. Titus. Thank you very much, and I want to thank our
chairman, Mr. DeFazio, for focusing this important hearing on
the bottlenecks at ports and our supply chain. I hear that all
the time, because we have to import almost everything we have
in Las Vegas, whether it is chicken wings or car parts. And so,
this is very important to us.
I have been reading a lot of the headlines in the Wall
Street Journal about Target, Walmart, and the different
companies that are stocking up for the holidays, and they are
pretty optimistic, and they are expecting a 10-percent increase
also in e-commerce from last year, which was a record high,
even with all the problems that we had with COVID. So, this is
going to increase, it is not going to backslide, I don't
believe, as we move forward. So, we see this increased request,
and increased demand that is far above whatever our production
levels are. So, we need to look at that, as well as the
shipment of these goods.
We have seen the problem as we looked at the airline
industry. A lot of the airlines didn't anticipate that our
recovery would happen so quickly. They laid people off, people
had early retirement, they were slow in getting them back. And
then when, suddenly people wanted to start traveling--we saw
that in Las Vegas--they weren't able to accommodate that. And
you have seen flights canceled, and a lot of problems at
airports.
So, we also heard from, I think Mr. Cordero, that the
canceling of passenger flights has also affected cargo, because
there is a lot of cargo down there in those baggage
compartments of the airplanes.
Now, a lot of my colleagues across the aisle have been
offering all these solutions, which really aren't solutions at
all, they are just kind of a rehashing of old problems, or old
things that they have always been talking about, like reducing
safety and reducing environmental protections. I don't think
that is going to solve any of our problems. We ought to be
looking at how to make this safer and more effective, going
forward. We ought to be talking about how vaccines will help us
get over COVID. And once that happens, the economy really can
come back even more than it already has, and how are we going
to deal with it. That is what we need to be doing, looking
forward.
You heard some talk about inland ports, dry land ports. I
think Eddie Bernice Johnson mentioned it. All the investments
that are coming out of the infrastructure bill and the Build
Back Better bill will help places like Las Vegas upgrade its
infrastructure, so we can become an inland port. And that can
help with these supply chain issues, as well. That should be
our focus in this hearing, not some looking back to the past
for things that didn't work, even then.
My question, though, is a followup from what Mr. Massie
said, and I would direct this to Mr. Correll.
You were talking about technological improvements. Well, we
are certainly familiar in this committee with outdated
technology. We saw that in the airline industry, where they
were still using paper slips to schedule aircraft. We needed to
bring that into the 21st century. Mr. Correll, could you
elaborate on what kind of technological things that we need to
do, not just for big companies like Amazon, but for other
companies, too, to help with this, going forward?
And then I would ask Mr. Jefferies and Mr. Spear if you
could talk about what your clients, or your organizations, or
your folks and members are doing to address these technological
needs, as well.
Mr. Correll. Excellent, thank you very much for the
question. I will be brief, to save time for my fellow
witnesses, as well.
I think there is tremendous opportunity, to use the airline
as an example, to understand what we can do better. So, thank
you for setting that in the way that you did.
If we think about what happens when a truckdriver arrives
at a facility, oftentimes they come in, they stop at a gate,
there is some interaction between the human and the driver to
confirm that that driver is who they said they are, and that
they have the appointment time that they are supposed to. Then
they can go to a staging lot, where sometimes they have to get
out of the truck, then take that paperwork into a desk, have
that desk work checked, sometimes hand over their license, then
come back to the truck and wait to be called. It is a paper-
based system that is, I believe, antiquated, and we could do a
lot better. And there are, in fact, already technological
solutions on offer in experimental trials to make this whole
system contactless.
So, I think that is a great notion. It should be a lot more
like when we take a flight, and I just show my boarding pass on
my phone, and a lot less like flights were 20 or 30 years ago,
which is how some of our systems are currently working. So,
that would be the first area of improvement.
And the second lesson that I would like to take from
airlines is one of the things I work on is scheduling
algorithms. So, when you think about how do you schedule
airplanes coming into an airport, well, they have a set time.
But we also think about things like how much fuel is in the
tank of the airplane in the sky, and we can prioritize them
that way. We don't do the same thing with our drivers' hours of
service available when we schedule them for their appointments,
and I really think we should.
So, those would be the two technological solutions I would
certainly recommend.
Ms. Titus. Well, thank you. I think we need to look into
how we can promote that, and maybe the other two could send
their answers to the committee because, unfortunately, I am out
of time.
Thank you, and I yield back.
Mr. Carbajal [presiding]. Thank you. Next, we will move on
with Representative LaMalfa.
Mr. LaMalfa. Well, thank you. I appreciate it. This is a
very important topic in this hearing, and I am glad we are
having it today.
Many, many facets of our difficulties, especially in
California--I appreciate Mr. Perry and Mr. Spear's conversation
about that a while ago on AB5, and then the great idea of
bringing it nationally with the PRO Act. If you want to talk
about supply chain, and you want to talk about ability for
owner-operators and the mom-and-pop outfits to be able to do
what they want to do in competing, so it is an important
conversation to continue to have.
So, we see that our two largest ports in Los Angeles and
Long Beach, they rank about number 328 and 333 out of 351
total, in the world, on efficiency. We had a port slowdown--
almost a shutdown--back in 2014, 2015, when that helped bottle
things up for California and the west coast. The contributing
factor, as mentioned, on AB5, it is all in the name of
protecting workers, but these workers don't belong to other
companies, they are independents. So, it nearly wiped out all
the independent contractors. So, it even slopped over into Uber
and Lyft, and things like that, but it is extremely important
in our trucking industry.
And we also have the challenge with the California Air
Resources Board just arbitrarily deciding trucks made before
2011 we can't use anymore, even though they could be
retrofitted and kept in good repair and do just fine. So, that
took a whole bunch of trucks out of our ability to operate.
So, can we talk, Ms. Reinke, about how those impacts are
disrupting the supply chain from AB5, and from CARB? Can you
emphasize that a little bit more from a previous comment?
Ms. Reinke. Sure. So, there are about 250,000-plus trucking
operations with 1 to 6 drivers as part of the total operation,
which is about double what that was 10 years ago. So, if you
think about that, that is a thriving industry, and it is
something that our members certainly rely on, because that
represents a vast majority of the trucking population.
So, if you were to take them out of the equation, or alter
their employment status, that could immediately reduce the
capacity for truckdrivers that we can use, or that people that
have a job--they may not want to be part of a larger employer,
they may want to employ themselves. It is sort of the American
Dream. They get to choose what they want to do. So, if that
removes capacity, our members would be very, very concerned
about it. And obviously, if it is replicated nationwide, then
that is when it could be a company risk for our members.
As for environmental regulations, our members, obviously,
are very supportive of programs like EPA SmartWay, and things
like that. But one of the proposed regulations from CARB would
hold our brokers, who are not asset-based--we do not largely
own trucks--responsible to be fleet owners and determine
whether or not the trucks that are used are compliant with
zero-emission goals by 2045. So, we only arrange
transportation. We do not own the trucks. We are not implicated
in the operation of trucks.
So that would mean that our members would have to be
involved. We think that that is a strong, strenuous overreach.
It has not yet been fully regulated. We continue to petition
CARB, so that we can have some more right-sized regulation in
that space.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you.
Mr. Spear, let me shift to you for a moment. When we are
talking about how the drivers would feel about a vaccine
mandate, what kind of reactions are you getting from them on
that, just all of them required to get a vaccine to do
business?
Mr. Spear. Yes, and I want to be clear and qualify this,
that this isn't about being pro- or anti-vax for us. We have
been moving the vaccine, PPE, and test kits. So, this is
something our industry is very forward-leaning on. But in our
sample survey of our fleets, it came back as 37 percent of our
drivers not only said no, but hell no.
Now, let's just take a conservative number. Let's just say
3.7 percent, not 37 percent, were to actually leave, rather
than get the vaccine. That would be catastrophic. We are
already short 80,000. That is going to inflate it to one-
quarter million.
So, for us, we have tried to be very clear with the
administration that, if you do this--I understand the logic
behind it, but if you do this, these are the consequences. So,
if you are trying to solve the supply chain problem, you are
actually compounding it, and actually hurting the very problem
that you are trying to fix on the vaccine side. So, be careful
what you wish for here.
I also don't think, Congressman, that OSHA has the
jurisdiction to do this.
Mr. LaMalfa. Yes, the courts are seemingly holding that up,
too. So, this whole mandate seems to be crumbling around them
right now. It is out of line. Thank you.
Mr. Cordero, let's touch quickly on the supply chain as
something that should go both directions. As we see, about
three-quarters of our containers are leaving the United States
empty, are the figures we have. So, to me, it seems important
both ways. You should have full containers if they are coming
in; they should go out full. It is affecting our crops,
affecting manufacturers, and economy. They are going to lose
market share if they keep sending empties back.
Could you touch upon what we could be doing better to fill
the ships leaving with our products, instead of letting them go
empty?
Mr. Cordero. Well, that is a great question, though,
Congressman. I think there has been a number of years that, not
only the Federal Maritime Commission, but port authorities have
advocated for a focus on increasing exports and, again,
supporting our export advocates and the American farmer, the
American shipper.
So, what we could be doing, one way that we are looking at,
is when we increase connectivity to the inland, and create more
efficiencies, that benefits our American exports, particularly
in California. We have a high number of grain [inaudible]
products as well as the Midwest, of course----
Mr. Carbajal. Mr. Cordero, if you could, sum that up real
quick.
Mr. Cordero. Sure. So, I think----
Mr. Carbajal. Or put it in writing.
Mr. Cordero. Yes, sure. So, on the empty issue, again,
given the volume that we have, there is a big demand for
empties, with regard to the containers going back to Asia. That
has been problematic. Hopefully, again, as we continue to move
forward, it may be transitory in nature, in terms of what we
are looking for in terms of mid-year/next year. But that is an
issue that, again, we are attempting to address with regard to
the empty containers here.
Mr. LaMalfa. All right, thank you. Thank you. It sounds
like a trade issue here we need to be enforcing, as a country,
better. Thank you for that.
I yield back.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. Next, I will recognize
Representative Payne.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Cordero, in New Jersey's 10th Congressional District I
am proud to represent Port Newark and its terminal operators
that help keep the world's supply chain moving. Port Newark
Container Terminal recently completed a $500 million upgrade,
increasing its cargo capacity by 80 percent, and cutting its
turn times by 25 percent. The terminal operator plans to
further expand its infrastructure to meet the growing needs of
cargo shipping.
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law
this week invests $17 billion into port infrastructure. My
question to you is, how would this funding help prevent future
supply chain challenges?
Mr. Cordero. Well, it is very important, and very critical.
It is a step in the right direction. An example, in terms of
the west coast here, is the rail connectivity. For the Port of
Long Beach, we have had approximately $1.6 billion in the next
10 years authorized by our commission for spending on rail,
more specifically, on-dock rail.
So, I think, again, the $17 billion referenced is welcome
news for this industry with regard to what we need to do in
investing in port infrastructure, and the same with New York
and New Jersey. I mean, my good friend, Sam Ruda, the executive
director there, as you have indicated, they have done a great
job, in terms of investing in infrastructure. But again, it is
far short, in terms of what we need to do, given decades of not
investing in this industry.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
And Mr. Jefferies, on Precision Scheduled Railroading, as
chairman of the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials
Subcommittee, I joined Chairman DeFazio earlier this year in
requesting a GAO study of Precision Scheduled Railroading,
including how PSR and related assets and workforce reductions
impact the ability to meet the changing market demands.
The use of PSR is concerning to me, especially when it
leaves freight railroads significantly understaffed in the
middle of the worldwide supply chain crisis. Your testimony
describes efforts to reopen closed terminals and hire workers.
What other steps have the railroads taken in right-sizing their
assets and workforces to meet the current market demands?
Mr. Jefferies. Thank you for that question, Congressman.
And the term Precision Scheduled Railroading gets thrown around
a lot. I think it probably means a little something different
to everybody who uses it.
But you know, this year has certainly been unprecedented,
when it comes to demand. And as evidence of that, in my opening
statement I mentioned that, over the first 6 months of this
year, railroads moved more intermodal goods than they have in
any 6-month period in their history, using the employee base
that they had on hand without significant disruptions.
We are also seeing, when you compare 2019 to 2021, a slight
uptick in industrial products movements, and that is in the
face of a decrease in finished autos. Railroads moved 75
percent of finished autos. Those volumes have dropped off quite
a bit, given the semiconductor challenges that are facing that
industry. So, we look forward to moving more of those soon.
I also mentioned the fact that coming out of the west coast
are two primary railroads--actually have significant capacity
right now. We are prepared to take on significantly more
international containers to get those to the center of the
country.
But you are absolutely right. There are areas where we are
looking to hire additional employees. In many regions, we feel
properly sourced for demand. The Chicago terminal, writ large,
handled 11 percent increases in volumes year over year,
maintaining a green level of fluidity throughout the month of
October. But there are other areas where we are hiring across
different crafts. And so, it is not a one-size-fits-all
strategy. It is dependent on the characteristics of various
regions.
But I think the results we are seeing, not only to the
operations based on our employees' dedication, are the results
of decades of sustained private investment. We talk a lot about
infrastructure investment. This industry is one that has put
its money where its mouth is, quite literally, $25 billion a
year annually back into our network. We have the highest rated
infrastructure of any type in the country. And, we will keep at
it.
But we are up for the task, and we want additional----
[Audio interruption.]
Mr. Payne. OK, thank you. And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. I now recognize Representative
Balderson.
Mr. Balderson. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, and thank
you all for being here today and participating in this
important hearing. My first question is going to go to Mr.
Spear.
Mr. Spear, thank you for being here. I really appreciate
that. And the DRIVE Safe Act, thank you for your kind words on
that. I was a lead cosponsor on that and, as you know, it did
pass in the bipartisan infrastructure bill.
In your testimony you note the pandemic forced the
temporary closures of State DMVs and truckdriver training
schools, hurting the already fragile pipeline of new drivers
entering the industry. Are State DMVs and training schools back
and fully operational, or are you seeing any lingering issues
caused by the pandemic?
Mr. Spear. I appreciate the question, Congressman, and
thank you for your leadership and support on that bill. I love
seeing those provisions make it into that infrastructure
package. And we have got more work to do, as you know, but I
appreciate that.
Yes, I mean, you are taking me back to some dark days. The
early weeks of the pandemic, and everyone was trying to figure
it out. Just be mindful that we had 3.5 million truckdrivers
still getting in those cabs, moving, running lanes from Ohio up
to New York, and restocking those shelves. Not just the milk,
eggs, and bread, but I guess the 3 months' supply of TP that a
few people in this country think they needed. But there was a
driver to make sure it got back on the shelf.
And so, there was a lot of impediments back then, the
shutting of rest areas. So, to be compliant with rest breaks,
you are now seeing trucks parked on shoulders. The shutting of
the DMVs, certainly the medical certificates, the CDLs, CLPs,
the renewals of those things we needed exemptions from for a
period of time, while those DMVs were shuttered. We are
starting to see that come back online.
As far as training and schools, yes, that was very
difficult, early on. I mean, it was nearly shuttered. And that
was, obviously, a contributing factor from going from 61,500
drivers short coming into the pandemic, now at 80,000. That
backlog is now having to catch up. So, it just takes time. As
we come out of the pandemic, you are starting to see us ramp up
and address that. And hopefully, those numbers will begin to go
down.
But getting people in with those CDLs is going to be key,
and the DMVs and the schools have a big role to play.
Mr. Balderson. Thank you for that answer. I will follow up
with you.
I have spoken to your colleagues at the Ohio Trucking
Association about the recruitment challenges they have had in
getting young drivers through the certification process. A
major hurdle that they have mentioned is the lack of financial
assistance that is available to cover the cost of truckdriver
training programs. In your opinion, how much of a factor is the
cost of training programs in preventing interested folks from
pursuing a career in the industry?
Mr. Spear. Enough that we have got motor carriers paying
the full boat in many instances. But that is not going to solve
it. It may solve it for them, but it is not going to solve it
for those that don't have truck driving schools of their own
and can afford that.
So, 80 percent-plus of our members are less than 20 trucks.
Those folks don't have those luxuries. They have got to bring
in from recruiting, or from those schools that they work with.
So, it is an issue that I would say would be very beneficial to
attracting more talent into the schools, if they were to
qualify for grants, just like any other.
So, we would welcome that. I think that makes it even more
attractive to alleviate that burden, get the proper training in
place, get them credentialed, and get them out there driving.
So, the faster we can do that, and the easier we can make that
process, the better.
Mr. Balderson. OK, Mr. Spear, I am going to try to be a
little brief on this one, because I know my time is getting
short here. But during an Agriculture Committee hearing a few
weeks ago, I was able to discuss some of the CDL and CPL
waivers that previous administrations enacted at the onset of
the pandemic, with your colleague, Jon Samson.
Mr. Samson noted the immediate benefits of some of these
waivers, allowing truckers to obtain CDLs more efficiently. Do
you think it would be beneficial to extend these CDL waivers
and some of the other declarations throughout the duration of
the supply chain issues?
Mr. Spear. I wouldn't go so far to say waivers, but
certainly streamlining the system, and making credentialing
across the board easier. If you get your testing done in one
State, but you are domiciled, meaning you live full-time in
another State, those States don't recognize the testing and
credentialing, and there is a gap there between it that makes
the burden fall on that potential driver. We need to make that
easier, and there needs to be Federal leadership in making that
happen. Working with DOT, the FMCSA will, hopefully, streamline
that. But it is an impediment, and it is very impactful.
So, what Jon Samson was citing is very accurate. I wouldn't
just flat-out exempt--we need controls in there, we need to
make sure they get the right training and credentialing. But,
we are an interstate commerce-based business. So, as you are
crossing State lines, the system has to accommodate that. And
when it is just the State itself that is managing it, you get
some channel conflict when you are crossing State lines. And
having a little Federal leadership at DOT, engage on that, work
with the State DOTs should help really alleviate that at the
DMV level.
Mr. Balderson. Thank you very much, Mr. Spear.
I apologize, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you very much. I now recognize the
distinguished gentleman from California, Representative
Lowenthal.
Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I would like
to, before I ask my question, compliment you on how well you
are conducting this hearing. I want to address my first
question to Mr. Cordero.
As you know, Mr. Cordero, I have supported changes to the
PierPASS Traffic Mitigation Fee at the Port of Long Beach, as
has also John Porcari, the Port Envoy. And I was glad to see
the announcement that, from December 1st to January 31st, fees
will incentivize the use of off-peak hours, incentivizing the
fuller adoption of 24/7 operations to ease the backlogs, and
reduce idling, and ease community impact.
Mr. Cordero, can you speak to the importance of these kinds
of measures, and to others which can help everyone in the
supply chain scale up their efforts?
Mr. Cordero. And thank you for your question, Congressman.
Most definitively, we need to incentivize the industry to
take certain measures. And the one that you are referencing,
PierPASS, was set up for that incentive. That is, when you
move, this year, 20 million TEU containers, you cannot compact
that movement in ordinary business hours. So, what we are doing
at this point is not only expanding gate hours, talking about a
24/7 framework, but also making sure that our shippers, when
they take advantage of those extended gate hours, there is no
cost involved in that. And that is the reason for, again, this
movement to have the PierPASS fee applicable to day gates and
not night gates.
So, this is one step of many that we need to take to,
again, address the bottlenecks and congestion in the supply
chain, which--again, the crisis has brought this forth, but
this is an issue that has been, as you know, Congressman, a
question at some of our major gateways, in terms of the turn
time issue here, and what we need to do have to have greater
fluidity for the truckdrivers.
Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Cordero. I want to briefly
touch, Mr. Cordero, on one additional critical issue for our
community.
As we know, the movement of goods has inevitable
environmental consequences, particularly for frontline
communities in the key corridors. I want to underscore that now
is not the time to remove protections for those communities in
the name of short-term efficiency.
So, my question to you, Mr. Cordero, is what is the Port of
Long Beach doing, and what more can we do here, in Congress, to
make sure that goods are moving safely, efficiently, but
without increasing the pollution to these communities?
Mr. Cordero. Well, I think I can say that, both here in
Long Beach and partnering with the Port of Los Angeles, our
goal is to have zero emission from port operations, zero
emissions in relation to trucks in 2035, and zero emissions in
relation to cargo-handling equipment.
So, currently, I think it is welcome news that the
Infrastructure Act that we have referenced also creates funds
for electrical infrastructure. This is something that is going
to be very key, as we move forward to the next transition of
what the truck community will look like. And I am talking about
zero emission. This is not a vision anymore, it is an
actuality.
So, I think we need to get prepared for the necessary
infrastructure that is required. I am talking about the EV
infrastructure. It is going to create more efficiencies and,
more importantly, for all urban setting ports across the
Nation, friendlier, with regard to the impact of what these
emissions are to our neighborhoods and communities.
Mr. Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Cordero. I just want to
remind you and the other panelists that besides the
Infrastructure Act, the Build Back Better Act--which hopefully
will be passed by Congress and signed by the President--also
deals with the need for infrastructure that will reduce the
impacts of climate change. And so, these are really a
combination package.
And with that I yield back to our esteemed chairman.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Representative Lowenthal. I will
now recognize Representative Stauber.
[Pause.]
Mr. Carbajal. We will move on to Representative Van Drew.
Dr. Van Drew. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased that
the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure is finally
holding this hearing on the American supply chain crisis.
I have always advocated for a strong domestic supply chain.
It has been clear, since this summer, that we are in a supply
chain crisis, and that the situation has become worse due to
the inaction of those in power.
To our honorable witnesses, I thank you and the millions of
American workers that you all represent. Workers make our
country strong. I want to give American workers every tool
possible to be successful for themselves, their families, and
our great country of the United States of America. I wish that
we were meeting under better circumstances.
The United States is on the precipice of a dark American
winter. Our country faces self-inflicted economic ruin, rising
food prices, rising energy prices, rising housing prices,
backed-up ports, unreliable product delivery, and an absolute
labor shortage. This decaying economic environment is the
direct result of liberal policies that have disincentivized
business investment, flooding the economy with wasteful
spending, and telling people not to go to work.
These abysmal policies pale in comparison to the Biden
vaccine mandate. I want to state unequivocally that the single
greatest threat to economic security is the Biden vaccine
mandate. This vaccine mandate is legally absurd, and
existentially dangerous to our country of America. The rule
being pushed by OSHA will force all businesses with over 100
employees to require their staff to be vaccinated. If a worker
refuses to get forcefully vaccinated, then the employer will be
forced to fire them.
To be clear, this vaccine mandate is illegal. This vaccine
mandate is unconstitutional. This vaccine mandate is the single
worst idea to emerge from a famously incompetent
administration.
The Biden vaccine mandate will result in nothing less than
the total implosion of the American economy. If this mandate
goes through, there will be unprecedented mass resignations--
truckers, pilots, rail workers, sailors, construction workers.
We know, as a matter of fact, that the vaccine mandate will
result in resignations, up to one-third of the transportation
workforce, possibly. If this happens, it will begin a vicious
cycle of supply chain collapse that will send the United States
of America into economic depression. OSHA and the
administration are sleepwalking towards economic cataclysm of
which we have never seen before. It is truly baffling, and I
personally pray that the courts will stop them, as I think they
will.
I think back to President Abraham Lincoln's Lyceum address:
``If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author
and finisher. As a nation of free men, we must live through all
time, or die by suicide.'' This vaccine mandate reveals the
hubris and detachment of this administration. The committee
should use every tool at its disposal to prevent this impending
catastrophe.
I want to give our witnesses the opportunity to speak on
the truth of this vaccine mandate, and what it will do to our
country, and I direct my question to Chris Spear, president and
chief executive officer of the American Trucking Associations.
You testified before a Republican supply chain roundtable
last month. Could you please explain the harsh reality of what
the vaccine mandate will do to the American trucking workforce?
Thank you.
Mr. Spear. I appreciate that, Congressman. Now, again, as I
said earlier, this is not an issue for us at ATA about pro-vax
and anti-vax. It is a question of, if you do this, if you put
this mandate in place, this is what is going to happen.
So, what we did is we went out and surveyed our members,
and the response we got was 37 percent of our driver force had
indicated that they would not only leave, but they would
definitely exit the workforce altogether, not just leave that
carrier. So that is very problematic. Thirty-seven percent may
be high. But even if you took 3.7 percent, it would be
catastrophic. So, that is a measurable impact and added weight
on the supply chain and our ability to come out of the COVID
era. So, we are very, very concerned about that.
I am also very concerned about the fact that it picks
winners and losers. What is up with this 100 threshold? The
President got up and said, ``I am doing this under my authority
to protect the American people.'' OK, well, what about the
people that work for an employer under 100? Does their health
and safety not matter? Why are we picking winners and losers
here? It is to avoid public comment. It is about speed. It is
about getting this ETS on the street as quickly as possible.
Now, I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer. But I know
OSHA law. I know, in the 50 years of that agency, the only
three times that it has been amended, I hand-wrote those for
Senator Enzi, the late Senator from Wyoming. And I know they
have overstepped their jurisdiction here. This is not an
employment-based hazard. They do not have the jurisdiction to
regulate this. And I am very confident in the sixth circuit, as
of yesterday, that this is going to get bounced. So, they have
overstepped their boundaries here. And for all the reasons
cited, I don't think this is going to have an impact on the
supply chain, because the courts are going to overturn it, and
they should. They really should.
We need to be forward leaning on the vaccine. We need to
get people vaccinated. We are moving the vaccination.
Mr. Carbajal. If you could, summarize, please.
Mr. Spear. This is really an issue that we feel strongly
about, and it is a distraction from what we need to be focused
on with the supply chain.
Dr. Van Drew. I yield back, and I thank you.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. I will now recognize myself.
First, I want to start out by thanking all the witnesses
that are here today, and I will start with Mr. Cordero.
Can you describe the nature of the working relationship you
have had with the administration and the White House Supply
Chain Disruptions Task Force?
Have you found those discussions to be productive?
And are you confident in the administration's efforts?
Mr. Cordero. Well, thank you, Congressman.
Number one, those efforts have been very productive. A case
in point: one of the issues that we have here at our ports is
the constraint on our terminals as to capacity. So, within a
very short period, we have been able to address the loaded
imports that have been at the containers for more than 9 days,
and reduce that amount by almost 30 percent. What that does, it
creates more capacity in our terminals.
Obviously, we need to move the cargo. So, in that regard, I
would have to say that the White House Envoy, John Porcari, has
had a very good impact, in terms of his ability to get the
stakeholders together to address this issue. That is, we need
to roll up our sleeves. We are in a crisis, and we need to take
measures to move the cargo.
So, in that regard, again, I really appreciate the
prioritization of this issue that is led by the White House,
and we are doing all we can here, at the Nation's largest port
complex, to again try to move towards transformational change
of this supply chain.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. I understand the Maritime
Administration and the Federal Maritime Commission are working
with stakeholders to improve data sharing and transparency
within the supply chain. What role will the Port of Long Beach
and other ports across the country play in this data sharing,
Mr. Cordero?
Mr. Cordero. Well, it would be a significant role. I think
what we need to move to is an integrated platform, where,
again, this industry moves forward and gets comfort in sharing
data, again, to move forward the needle on visibility, and
transparency on the movement of cargo. So, I think it is fair
to say that every port authority is looking towards this
digital transformation.
For this committee, I would urge that if there is ever a
time for opportunity to fund these kind of capabilities for our
port authorities to move forward and exercise that leadership,
it is now. Because again, we are falling behind with regard to
what the rest of the world is doing, in terms of this
technology.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. Can the rest of the panel comment
on how their respective industries will be contributing to the
data sharing initiative, or how they will benefit?
Mr. Jefferies. Well, I think across the supply chain we are
all better served, and we have better data, both given the
integration of the work we do between modes, but also with our
customers, as well.
The world has gotten used to the Amazonification of the
economy. I know when my pizzamaker is putting pepperoni on the
pizza that I have ordered. So, visibility, information sharing,
of course, is key. There has got to be some smart boundaries
around it, some smart structure around it. But at the end of
the day, I think we are all better served working together, and
with real-time, good information. So, conceptually, there is a
lot to be done there.
Ms. Reinke. And we are in agreement. As I said, data is the
coin of the realm here. So, anything that can encourage
collaboration and cut redtape so that we can communicate, and
understand, and have visibility, I think we want to be part of
and understand, be supportive of.
Mr. Spear. Mr. Chairman, we would echo the same from Anne
and Ian. Mario started with digital transformation. We like
that concept. I think more transparency is good. It makes us
all more informed. It also identifies exactly where the
bottlenecks are. If we can measure them, we can remedy them.
So, more transparency, it is a challenge. I mean, you are
talking all these bottlenecks within the supply chain. We don't
control all of them. Not any of us do control all of them. But
seeing that panoramically is going to really provide some
efficiencies, and that is really the wave of the future. If we
can do that, I think it is going to make a difference.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Mr. Regan, this week the President, President Biden, signed
the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and
finally delivered on our promise to invest in our Nation's
crumbling infrastructure. Included in the bill is $2.2 billion
for the Port Infrastructure Development Program.Can you
elaborate on how this investment in our Nation's ports could
help alleviate congestion at our Nation's ports, and how we can
make sure we are getting the greatest return on this
investment?
Mr. Regan. Yes, and thank you for that question. As the
cargo volumes at ports have increased, the lack of
comprehensive multimodal connectivity have contributed greatly
to the congestion and delays. So, the Federal investment you
referenced, the Port Infrastructure Development Plan, would be
a huge boost to increasing that connectivity and that
intermodal infrastructure of ports throughout the country.
Multimodal port spending, you know, 67 percent of ports say
that funding is the single largest obstacle to constructing
essential freight rail connectors. In my written testimony and
in my spoken testimony I mentioned how nearly half of U.S.
ports state that better rail access could increase the
throughput capacity by over 25 percent. So, this is vital to
making sure that we are moving goods off of the ships, and then
easily and quickly into the rest of the country. So, this is a
really, really important part.
And I would also note that, in the Build Back Better Act,
there is an additional $5 billion of money for ports that is
directly geared towards addressing the supply chain here.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you very much. We will now move on to
Representative Stauber.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank you
to all our witnesses for being here today. Many of you are on
the front lines, trying to make the best of this crisis, and
working against all odds, while sidestepping each roadblock
this administration puts in your way. So, I say thank you.
Before going into my questions, I want to first highlight
some of President Biden and his administration's views on the
supply chain crisis, which really shows how much he cares about
the issue, and how seriously those in power are taking this.
``Most of the economic problems we are facing--inflation,
supply chains, et cetera--are high-class problems.'' This was
from Joe Biden's Chief of Staff.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki mocked the supply
chain issues, and laughed when asked about them, stating, ``The
tragedy of the treadmill delayed.''
Secretary Buttigieg said that our supply chain crisis was
due to Biden and the administration being ``too good at their
jobs.''
President Biden himself said recently that ordinary
Americans ``wouldn't even understand'' the supply chain.
When asked if holiday gifts would arrive on time, White
House Press Secretary Jen Psaki dismissively said--in
quotations--``we are not the Postal Service.''
When asked about higher costs at the grocery store, Jen
Psaki said, ``The American people are not looking at cost-to-
cost comparisons from this year to 2 years ago.'' And I repeat
that. Jen Psaki said, ``The American people are not looking at
cost-to-cost comparisons from this year to 2 years ago.''
I hate to be the wakeup call to this administration, and
maybe even to some folks in this room, but not everyone is
spending their Thanksgiving in the millionaire and billionaire
playground of Nantucket, like many people are. There are real,
ordinary Americans who are really suffering because of the
supply chain and inflation crisis this administration has
caused. Right now, there are families in Hibbing, Minnesota, in
North Branch, Minnesota, in Park Rapids, Minnesota, even in the
President's Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, who are still
figuring out how to put Thanksgiving dinner on the table this
year.
So, my question is to Ms. Reinke.
Can you please speak a little about what your industry is
doing to fill in the gaps and support the supply chain, despite
the President's policies?
And in addition to that, can you also speak to how the
Democrats' liability insurance increase--what I like to call
the trucker tax--would impact the supply chain, Ms. Reinke?
Ms. Reinke. Thank you, Congressman, for the question. I
will answer your second question first.
We are radical pragmatists. Our members are, literally,
just looking to try to find ways to improve efficiencies for
their customers and build capacity for the motor carriers and
intermodal companies that we work with. So, if there is an
implication, for example, raising the minimum insurance, we
don't have a position on it, but if it affects the capacity of
our motor carriers, if it cuts out smaller carriers who can't
afford it, then that would be a concern for us.
As for the first, what we are trying to do is, well, we are
hiring like crazy, like all of us are. In fact, there have
been, I think, the first half of the year, 9,000 new brokers
who applied for a broker's license and registered for a bond.
And that reflects the amount of freight that is going on.
And what we are trying to do, in addition to hiring like
crazy, is really invest and engage in technology. And I think I
have mentioned that it is visibility throughout the
transaction.
So, what does that mean? That means having--at the
beginning of the transaction, we have what are called load
boards, which shows what the freight is, where the freight is,
and how much one would charge if you take it.
Then you have the transportation management systems, where
you figure out, all right, what carriers are available, and
what route can we take it.
And then you have the visibility into where is that
container going, what is the timing on it, and how is it going?
And then the last thing is the automated back-end
processes, where we can pay automatically the carriers at the
end of the transaction.
So that is where, really, our money and our attention and
our time is focused on.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you very much.
And Mr. Spear, do you have anything to add to that?
Mr. Spear. Other than the fact that we really wanted to
find efficiencies through collaboration. As you have seen, the
transformation over the last 10, 15 years, we really are
intermodal. We do rely on one another. There is a lot of
collaboration between Mario and myself. We represent industries
that have to work together.
And so, finding bottlenecks, finding inefficiencies, it is
in all of our best interests to alleviate those problems. So,
any technology, any transparency is something that we are going
to commit to working and ensuring going forward that we can see
more and do more as a result.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you very much, and my time is up.
I yield, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. We will move on and recognize
Representative Malinowski.
Mr. Malinowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, a lot of
commentary in this hearing about this situation, and I would
start by saying what ought to be obvious, and that is that our
inflation and supply chain problems are probably not the result
of a bill that hasn't passed yet. They are probably not the
result of an infrastructure bill that was just signed a couple
of days ago.
What we know is that we had a global pandemic, which
resulted in massive economic downturns in the United States and
all around the world. But then we did something that we have
never done before: we actually helped the American people not
just endure and survive this downturn, but to emerge from it
with more household wealth than they did before they started.
That is a success. That is something that we should all be
proud of. And much of it was bipartisan. The legislation that
helped our small businesses and families and workers stay
afloat through the first year of the pandemic was supported by
just about every single member of this committee.
So, here is the situation. We have huge disruptions in
production all around the world, workers not coming to work,
workers sick, disruptions in transportation and bringing goods
to market. But at the same time, the American people have more
money to spend. And interestingly, they are spending it in
different ways.
So, for example, last year we saw a 32-percent increase in
e-commerce, because people were staying home, rather than going
to stores. They are ordering stuff online. And so, with all of
those facts, I think it is fairly easy to understand how we got
to where we are.
And I wanted to ask the witnesses maybe to comment a little
bit on that, and maybe starting with Mr. Cordero.
In your testimony you brought out another remarkable fact,
and that is that the Ports of L.A. and Long Beach, in the first
10 months of this year, actually moved 17 percent more
containers than they did in a similar period in 2018. And yet
we have ships parked offshore. But we are actually moving more
containers through the system. Could you say a little bit about
why that is, what we know and what we don't know?
Mr. Cordero. So, thank you, Congressman. So yes, the ports
will have a record year for 2021 in container movement. And in
part, there is, again, a myriad of factors as to why that is,
in terms of what we have before us. But one of the things that
you mentioned that is very key is how we have been able to
continue the trajectory on the economy, in terms of the benefit
of what we are seeing. And one of them is consumer spending.
I think it is at a very high mark. E-commerce is a major
factor, in terms of our spending habits. We could buy online
24/7. So, I think the good news is the consumer demand that is
driving this, and the business environment, and, again, whether
it is production, raw materials, and durable goods, and so
forth. So, I think, again, that the good news is it is a very
good economy that we are seeing because of the policies that we
have been putting in place here in the last couple of years.
But the thing I really want to stress, and say to this
committee again, just remember that in 2010 a major economist
here in this industry forecasted that if we did not invest and
do something, in terms of how we operate in the North American
ports here in America, that in 2020 we would have some serious
congestion issues. He was right on the money. And that is what
I want to stress to this committee, that crisis set aside, we
need to continue the prioritization of how important ports are
to this----
Mr. Malinowski. Thank you, and we have just--thanks to
President Biden and a bipartisan majority in the House and
Senate, thanks to those courageous Republicans who joined us,
we just approved a major investment in our ports that will help
in the long term.
I don't have that much time left. I did want to ask Ms.
Reinke about the question of visibility in the supply chain.
Somebody mentioned to me a few days ago that we actually have
very little idea of where all these containers are. There are
20 million or so shipping containers around the world. But
unlike aircraft and their passengers, there are no sensors on
these containers. Is that correct?
Would the system benefit from a greater investment in the
technology that allows us to have perfect visibility of where
everything is in the system, and should the United States be
setting those standards?
Ms. Reinke. I----
Mr. Carbajal. Mr. Malinowski, you are out of time. I am
going to ask if they could submit that answer----
Ms. Reinke. Will do.
Mr. Carbajal. Take that question for the record, and submit
the response in writing, please.
Mr. Malinowski. Thank you.
Mr. Carbajal. With that, we will move on to Representative
Guest. And Mr. Guest will be our last speaker, because we are
going to have to recess due to votes.
Mr. Guest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
To Mr. Spear and Ms. Reinke, I want to talk about something
that each of you mentioned in your written testimony, and that
would be the impact that the PRO Act would have on our
transportation market.
Mr. Spear, you say--and I quote from your written
testimony--``I would be remiss if I did not address a piece of
legislation that would be extremely harmful to the trucking
industry and hurt the very workers it purports to help: . . .
H.R. 842. The PRO Act . . . includes a provision that would
effectively bar the trucking industry from utilizing the
independent contractor business model. . . . [t]he
implementation of a restrictive national test to limit
independent contractor status would jeopardize the livelihoods
of over 350,000 owner-operators, destabilizing America's supply
chain and irreparably harming the economy.''
Ms. Reinke, you say there ``The PRO Act, which would change
the way independent contractors are classified at the Federal
level, would make this a national issue and have devastating
effects on the transportation market.''
Ms. Reinke, you also reference California Assembly Bill 5,
which I believe is a precursor to the PRO Act, which you state
there ``essentially bars independent contractors from operating
in the state, will further exacerbate the supply chain
situation by narrowing the pool of available drivers and
companies.''
And so, to Mr. Spear and Ms. Reinke, I would ask if you
would take a few moments and expand on the effect that the PRO
Act would have, assuming that it was passed and signed into
law, what effect that would have on our current supply chain
issues, and the economy as a whole?
Mr. Spear. I will go quickly, so Anne can comment, as well,
but I think the commentary that you cited from both of our
testimonies certainly captures it.
But to add a little bit more color, it is going to remove
choice, as simple as that. People should have the choice to
decide their professional paths. This would remove that, which
is why it is before the Supreme Court now. I believe they are
going to hear it, and hopefully they rule correctly, because we
believe that people should have the right to choose to be an
independent contractor, for whatever reason. If they want to be
a seasonal worker, a part-time worker, have their own business
on the side, that should be their choice.
Forcing them to join a union, which is what this would do,
is very destructive. It removes decades--since 1935, the
National Labor Relations Act, the balance that has existed for
decades between unions and employers--it would remove all that.
It would remove State right-to-work laws. It is just really
rewriting everything to channel people into unions, which is
the point. We are just removing choice, and that is anti-
American, and we oppose it.
I just think it would have added weight on the supply chain
and make it even more difficult to resolve a lot of the issues
that this panel has been testifying here today.
Mr. Regan. Congressman, if I may jump in here, there has
been a lot of dumping on the PRO Act, and I am a strong
supporter of the PRO Act.
Mr. Spear here references the balance between labor and
management that has happened over the years. The balance has
been inherently tilted against labor, against workers, and in
favor of employment. And all of these various employment models
that we have seen emerge over time have been in place
specifically to undermine a worker's right to collectively
bargain and undermine the worker's right to have more voice and
more strength in the workplace.
We are strong supporters of that, and the solution to our
supply chain issues, and the solution to strengthening our
economy is not going to be by driving a greater wedge between
employment and the workers, by making sure that people can't
earn better wages, and they cannot earn better benefits and
retirement benefits. These are not going to be the solutions to
our problem, and it is certainly not going to make a better,
stronger economy for all Americans across the board. Thank you.
Mr. Guest. Well, I would assume, Ms. Reinke, that you would
take exception to those comments.
Ms. Reinke. Yes. I mean, in the mode of being a radical
pragmatist again, we are concerned it is going to completely
remove capacity. I think Mr. Spear talked about removing
choice. We are talking about removing capacity, meaning this is
a highly successful industry. The owner-operator model, as I
said, has doubled over the last 10 years.
There is clearly a draw for people who want to own their
own businesses, who want to have one to six trucks, who want to
have that freedom and that liberty and that choice, as Mr.
Spear said. So, if that is now taken away from them, are they
just going to leave the marketplace? Are they going to leave
the industry because they don't want to be someone else's
employee? That is what we are concerned about.
Mr. Regan. The PRO Act does not force anybody to join a
union. It gives them more choice, and a more fair choice that
has not existed for decades.
Mr. Spear. We will let the courts decide, Greg.
Mr. Guest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. Since they have called votes on
the House floor, the committee shall stand in recess, subject
to the call of the Chair. We will restart the hearing as soon
as the last vote is over, I guess.
[Recess.]
Mr. Stanton [presiding]. The committee will reconvene at
this time. I really want to thank the witnesses for their
patience, as the Members had to go vote on the floor.
Next up to question our witnesses is Congressmember Garcia
from Illinois.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, of
course, a special thanks to Chairman DeFazio for holding this
hearing, and I thank all the witnesses for appearing today.
The supply chain problems we are currently experiencing
have affected all Americans, including the district that I
represent. The additional investment in the Build Back Better
legislation, combined with the record infrastructure
investments that Congress just passed, will unlock our supply
chain, help American workers keep our economy growing, and
lower inflation. That is why we need to pass the Build Back
Better legislation.
But I want to ask Mr. Regan if he would answer the
following: Mr. Regan, many of my Republican colleagues, as you
saw earlier, falsely accuse President Biden of causing the
supply chain crisis, or ruining Christmas for Americans. What
is your reaction to those statements from my friends across the
aisle?
Mr. Regan. Thank you for that question. There have been
many times during this hearing where I have been a little
frustrated by the characterization of all of this stuff.
This supply chain crisis has, frankly, been 40 years in the
making. We detailed earlier exactly how the systematic industry
practices that have happened in both the trucking and rail
industry have created this very inelastic system, where, the
minute we had a surge in goods, we were completely incapable of
being able to deal with it.
Meanwhile, what President Biden has done with the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act--which, by the way, all
of my fellow trade association members of this panel supported
and hailed the passage of in their testimony--that would
actually direct a huge amount of money directly into our supply
chain crisis and start addressing the infrastructure needs to
help solve this, moving forward.
And I might add, many of the politicians that are talking
today have no comments about the previous President, who not
only talked a big game, but didn't even deliver a proposal to
solve any of these issues, let alone actually deliver on the
promise of delivering on real investment and real movement
towards investing in our infrastructure.
So when I see things like #emptyshelvesBiden alongside an
out-of-context photo from the supermarket with empty shelves
from an ice storm that was 2 years ago, or that Biden is
ruining Christmas because some children may not get their
ThinkFun Gravity Marble Maze under the tree, while overlooking
the fact that there are 37 million Americans living in poverty
who don't even know where they are going to get their next
meal, I get very aggravated by that.
It is extremely frustrating, because all they are doing
with that type of commentary is exploiting a real crisis. And I
hope that we can actually start talking about real solutions.
And thankfully, I know that many of my colleagues on this panel
are talking about that, are talking about issues in their
industry, and their testimonies talk about the benefit that
President Biden's investment in the IIJA is going to have in
this situation. Thank you.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you for sharing that, Mr.
Regan. I want to turn to another subject, and that is railroad
profits and job cuts. You note in your testimony that, since
2014, Class I railroads have implemented Precision Scheduled
Railroading, and cut their workforce by over 20 percent, if I
heard you right, resulting in tens of thousands of job losses.
At the same time, Class I railroads are reporting record
profits in their most recent quarterly earnings.
My first question on that is, in your opinion, is it fair
to say that so many railroad workers are losing their jobs,
while railroads are doing as well as they ever have?
Mr. Regan. Yes. Certainly, by the profit margins, yes, they
are doing as well as they ever have.
And if you look at since 2010, the railroads have taken
back an astonishing $191 billion on stock buybacks and
dividends alone. Meanwhile, the workforce has shrunk by 20
percent, just in 5 years, and we have seen a drastic reduction
in the built-out infrastructure, on the physical infrastructure
with the railroads. So, I think that there is a real cognitive
dissonance between sort of what we are talking about, in terms
of investing and rising to the occasion, versus what the
practices have been for 5, 10 years.
And, frankly, this is something we have been warning about
for that amount of time. I think the first time I talked about
this in front of the T&I Committee, it must have been 2 or 3
years ago, but we started writing about it 5 or 6 years ago.
This is not a new problem, it wasn't an unforeseen crisis that
sort of came out of thin air.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Well, thank you and----
Mr. Jefferies. Mr. Garcia, can I comment on that, please? I
know we only have a few----
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. I am not finished yet. I got
about----
Mr. Jefferies. OK.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Let me ask you what Congress or
agencies like the FRA or the STB can do to help counteract
negative effects of PSR, and ensure a long-term, robust rail
workforce?
Mr. Regan. Well, certainly from the FRA perspective, I
mean, we need to make sure that the operations are safe, and
that is going to be the critical role for the FRA, is making
sure that we continue to have safe freight rail operations, and
that the reductions in workforce and the resulting operations
changes are not creating an unsafe situation. So, the FRA is
going to play a key role there.
STB needs to make sure that the freight railroads are
fulfilling their common carrier obligations that are statutory
in nature, and they are going to make sure that they can
properly regulate this industry.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Well, thank you, and I leave it to
the chair, because my time has run out.
Mr. Jefferies. I think it is convenient I wasn't allowed to
be able to respond there, but we will do that in the record.
Thanks.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you so much. I will now recognize
Congressmember Van Duyne for 5 minutes.
Ms. Van Duyne. I am interested, Mr. Jefferies, in your
comments. Would you please take 30 seconds to just finish what
you were going to start, that you were prevented from saying?
Mr. Jefferies. Sure, I would love to. We are a demand-based
business. We hire based on the demands we are facing. And I
think, as I said earlier this year, we moved more intermodal
than we have in any 6-month period in history with the employee
base we had. We kept the network fluid. We are investing $25
billion of our own money back into our network every year, the
result of the highest graded infrastructure of any
infrastructure in this country. We are not seeking bailouts
from the Government. We do support integrated infrastructure
investment.
And when it comes to safety, in 2020, we had record levels
of several of our safety measurements: safest employee injury
rate in the history of the industry last year, which exactly is
what Greg is talking about, timeline-wise.
So, the facts don't add up with these claims. And so, I
think it is important to be able to rebut that. Thank you.
Ms. Van Duyne. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
During the last 11 months I have marveled at the resilience
of countless small and medium-sized north Texas businesses, as
they have worked through unprecedented and ever-changing
problems to stay afloat. The stories I have heard in business
roundtables and in tours across north Texas are not only a
testament to the rugged spirit of our entrepreneurs, but also
infuriating, as I have heard how the policies of our own
Government are dragging these good people down. Small
businesses across our region are adjusting business models,
changing food menus, finding new suppliers, and doing
everything they can to battle against the biggest threat to
their operations, which is the President in the United States.
Mr. Regan, I appreciate your comments on bashing the entire
right side of the aisle on our lack of being able to put
through a transportation bill. But I am also shocked that you
would grab hold of what we just passed. I guess you are just a
big fan of regulations, of supply chain woes. And while you
think that the only thing that the supply chain is hurting is
Tinkertoys are not being put under the Christmas tree, I would
hope that you understand that we are also talking about
lifesaving equipment, we are talking about medicine, we are
talking about liquid oxygen that is actually providing people
with a sustainable life. So, it is not just toys that we are
talking about that are lacking in the supply chain, but other
really important items.
I have a question for Chris Spear, and thank you, Mr.
Spear. I have listened to a lot of your testimony today, and
you have been right on, and I want to thank you for your
patience in dealing with what we have been doing for hours and
hours, even though that was not on the agenda today.
The Port of Los Angeles has been America's busiest port for
the last 20 years, and it handles 20 percent of all the
incoming cargo for the U.S. The Port of Long Beach is the
second busiest container seaport in the U.S., handling an
annual estimated trade value of $170 billion. We are witnessing
crippling supply chain disruptions at these ports now, but I
worry that California's extreme policies related to labor and
climate will only exacerbate these problems, moving forward.
So, the California Air Resources Board passed a rule that
says all short-haul drayage vehicles in ports and rail yards
must be zero emissions by 2035, and all commercial trucks sold
in the State must be zero emissions in 2045. Given the cost and
limited market availability of zero-emission trucks, as well as
the operational challenges related to insufficient charging
infrastructure for heavy-duty vehicles, I am concerned that the
standards California is setting are unachievable and will cause
further damage to the supply chain in our Nation's two business
ports.
Mr. Spear, do you share my concerns regarding these extreme
policies and future challenges?
Mr. Spear. Yes, thank you, Congresswoman, I think that what
you are witnessing come out of CARB is a lack of stakeholder
input. And it is clear it is not reflected in the .02 standard
that they are proposing, the timeline for the electrification.
It just cannot be met. It is just not possible to invent that
kind of technology in that amount of time, and have it adopted
by our members.
Now, both are represented by the ATA, so I have had both
perspectives. We have met with Gina McCarthy at the White
House. We have had lengthy conversations with EPA Administrator
Regan on this issue, to make certain that they understand that
this is not being against the environment. We all want clean
water, clean air, and we have been a participant in designing
phase 1 and 2 of emissions.
But on this third leg, this next phase, if they go with the
CARB standard, .02, it is not possible. It is just simply not
possible to meet it, and it is going to fail. And if it fails,
then everybody looks bad. We can comply with .05, we have made
that very clear to them. We can comply with timelines that are
more reasonable to invent, adopt, and deploy that kind of
equipment, nationally.
But letting California--this is not the United States of
California, this is the United States of America. And letting
CARB in California dictate the terms and conditions of all
manufacturing across this country--because they don't want 2
lines of business, they want 1, and that is why we have it for
50 States, not 1.
So, this is really a reflection on where we are. And
putting good regulations that are clear, and can be complied
with, we favor that. We are fine, we are not anti-reg. We just
want stuff that can be achieved. This is not.
Ms. Van Duyne. I thank you, Mr. Spear, I appreciate you
giving me that all on the record.
I yield back my time.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much. I now recognize
Congressmember Auchincloss for 5 minutes.
[Pause.]
Mr. Auchincloss. Thanks, Chair.
Dr. Correll, my questions are for you, and about the
truckdriver crisis, in particular. Your research suggests that
the truckdriver crisis is not a headcount shortage, but rather
an ``endemic undervaluing of our American truckdrivers' time.''
You discuss the retention problem, as well as staffing policies
that ``de facto limit drivers to only 6.5 hours daily
driving.'' Can you elaborate on those staffing policies?
Mr. Correll. Sure. Thank you for your question. So, one of
the things that I look at is what are the factors that
contribute to drivers being underutilized, not getting as many
hours per day driving as they would like to get. And I see that
it has a lot to do with detention. So, how they are--how slowly
they are processed at facilities.
The key indicator, I think, of what makes processing go
faster or slower is how the facility is staffed. So, when we
look at how we can get more hours out of our existing
population of drivers, I think it goes back to how are we
processing them at the warehouses and distribution centers, and
that is a staffing and planning question, in my mind.
Mr. Auchincloss. And I want to touch also on data
collection. You made recommendations for better governmental
leadership in data collection. Would it also be helpful for the
Federal Government to study staffing policies like the
misclassification of drivers and poor treatment and pay that
have been highlighted by the unions like the Teamsters that may
be exacerbating current supply chain issues and hindering our
competitiveness?
Mr. Correll. I think so. I think my own experience is--I
don't study data related to the legal organization of the
truckdrivers in the datasets that I have, so that would be
outside of what I previously studied. But I think any time that
the Government could help us to organize a formalized study
into the actual data of where the problems are, that is really
what I am hoping to bring to this committee's conversation.
One of the things that I have noticed is that, as I work
with shippers and receivers and truckdrivers and say, ``All
right, what is going on,'' it is almost like a Rorschach test,
where people repeat back to you either the most recent bad
thing that happened to them, or whatever their improvement
hobbyhorse happens to be. And the real value of data collection
is that we can all have those personal opinions, but we can
weigh them against the greater aggregate datasets.
And that is what I was hoping to bring to the community
today. And I think, going forward, that is the tool we have to
find the solutions that give us the most bang for the buck when
you make those investments. So, I do think that would really
help.
Mr. Auchincloss. That reminds me of the aphorism that the
plural of anecdote is not data.
Mr. Correll. Excellent, excellent.
Mr. Auchincloss. The final question for you is the Los
Angeles Alliance for a New Economy submitted recommendations to
the committee for steps Congress can take to address current
supply chain and future supply chain chokepoints, and those
included supporting the PRO Act, and protections for workers,
and encouraging the use of unionized companies, or companies
with labor peace agreements to expedite the clearing of
backlogged containers. Do you have a point of view on whether
these increased protections and investments in the workforce
would allow there to be better staffing policies, and resolve
some of the issues that you have raised?
Mr. Correll. Could you describe the protections, just
briefly, that I should comment on?
Mr. Auchincloss. Those encompassed in the PRO Act, in
particular.
Mr. Correll. I am afraid I don't have a strong----
Mr. Auchincloss. Basically, supporting the right to
collective bargaining and protections in the workplace for
union truckers.
Mr. Correll. On that question--I have extolled all the good
virtues of data. The bad side is that it is all necessarily
historical. So I don't have, you know, going back to pre-1980,
those are the comparisons that I think would be most helpful
that I don't have.
The notion that I would like to bring to this community,
though, is that, when we think about the role of labor unions
as giving drivers a voice in how they are managed, and how they
are treated, historically those were very strong voices. And
over time maybe they have lost some power, at least as I have
read the situation. I have seen the rise of data collection as
a way to amplify that voice. So, drivers and entrepreneurs in
the driver community are creating datasets that measure how
they are treated at facilities, and sharing that amongst one
another, which is, in its own way, sort of a collective action,
if you will.
So, sort of my bottom line take on it is I don't have data
to speak to the organized labor force, but I do see, within the
driver community, an effort to use data to harmonize their
opinions and share them to improve the way they are treated.
Mr. Auchincloss. Well, Doctor, I appreciate your empirical
approach to this question. It is very much in the keeping of
MIT's rigor, so thank you.
Mr. Correll. Thank you.
Mr. Auchincloss. And Chair, I yield back my balance of my
time.
Mr. Stanton. I now recognize Congressmember Steel for 5
minutes.
Mrs. Steel. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, all the
witnesses coming out today.
We have a crisis happening at our ports. Hundreds of
thousands of shipping containers are sitting off the coast of
California. These containers are full of essential goods like
medical supplies, auto parts, and other basic, everyday
necessities. Congress cannot double down on failing economic
policies that make life for American businesses and workers
harder and more expensive.
Additionally, this supply chain crisis has wreaked havoc on
our environment. Myself, Congressman LaMalfa, and other Members
of the California delegation will be sending a letter to
Governor Newsom today, asking to declare a state of emergency
at our ports and across the goods transportation and storage
distribution chain. I would like to submit it for the record.
It is a letter here, Mr. Chairman, so I am going to submit this
today.
[The information follows:]

Letter of November 17, 2021, to Hon. Gavin Newsom, Governor, State of
California, from Hon. Michelle Steel et al., Submitted for the Record
by Hon. Michelle Steel
Congress of the United States,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC 20515-0548,
November 17, 2021.
The Honorable Gavin Newsom,
Governor,
State of California, 1303 10th Street, Suite 1173, Sacramento, CA
95814.
Dear Governor Newsom:
Right now, hundreds of thousands of shipping containers are sitting
off the coast of California. These containers are full of essential
goods like medical supplies, auto parts, and other basic everyday
necessities. A record number of cargo ships--more than 100--are still
idling and anchored off the coast every day. The President's recent
call for 24/7 operations at our ports to get these ships and cargo
moving is a step in the right direction, but we are still faced with a
massive crisis, with no sign of slowing.
As Members of Congress, representing millions of Californians, we
urge you to declare a State of Emergency at our ports and across the
goods transportation and storage distribution chain. The Ports of Long
Beach and Los Angeles are responsible for more than 40% of container
imports in the United States, and 30% of exports. With record-high
inflation affecting every single American, the continued backlog of
goods, expected to last into 2022, is driving economic concerns and
high prices.
This backlog of ships is also creating an environmental hazard.
Normal operations are responsible for more than 100 tons per day of
smog and particulate-forming nitrogen oxides. But current operations
are seeing five times the number of ships that are anchored and idling
off the coast, vastly increasing pollution. We have a crisis on our
hands the longer these ships idle off our shores.
Unfortunately, California's own burdensome laws and regulations
that restrict goods from moving to consumers, have contributed to this
crisis. Your immediate action to suspend or eliminate the rules and
regulations stopping goods from moving from our ports is critical to
the safety and security of our economy and our state.
Assembly Bill 5 (AB5) restricts the ability of Californians to work
as independent contractors. This law creates a chilling effect for many
of the supply chain industries and makes it more difficult for
independently contracted drivers to operate, leading many to leave
California. According to the Port of Long Beach, most truck chassis now
come from Tennessee because of the favorable tax treatment they are
given over those registered in California. Without enough truckers to
come and unload, this cargo will continue to sit on these ships, just
waiting to be delivered. It is time to end AB5 and allow for
independent contractors to work freely within California.
It is imperative to suspend the new and overburdensome Warehouse
Indirect Source rule recently promulgated by the South Coast Air
Quality Management (SCAQMD). This rule, and particularly the Warehouse
Actions and Investments to Reduce Emissions (WAIRE) Program, places
massive costs on local warehouses in potential mitigation fees and
restricts the number of truck trips to and from warehouse facilities.
Facilities that fail to meet these trucking requirements must pay
``mitigation fees'' that SCAQMD estimates show could cost Southern
California Warehouse Operators up to $1 billion per year. Restricting
the number of trucks traveling to and from warehouses, and increasing
the cost of doing so, only makes supply chain delays worse. It is time
to waive these rules to help get essential and lifesaving supplies to
those who need it.
California Environmental Quality Act compliance and complex land
use permitting rules are key contributors to the state's shortage of
adequate warehouse and storage facilities. We urge you to expedite CEQA
review and permitting processes for warehouses, storage facilities and
other supply chain facilities essential for goods distribution.
Americans rely on the efficient movement of goods through
California's ports to feed and clothe their families. And American
producers rely on that same goods movement to ship their products to
consumers around the world. It is critical that supply chain
restrictions created by the State of California be removed to resolve
this crisis.
Sincerely,
Michelle Steel,
Member of Congress.
Doug LaMalfa,
Member of Congress.
David G. Valadao,
Member of Congress.
Ken Calvert,
Member of Congress.
Jay Obernolte,
Member of Congress.
Devin Nunes,
Member of Congress.
Tom McClintock,
Member of Congress.
Darrell Issa,
Member of Congress.

Mrs. Steel. So, my question is, Mr. Cordero, that I just
recently toured the port with Darin Wright and other members of
your team, and I learned a lot. According to your testimony,
24/7 operations will help to mitigate the current surge. But I
heard at the port it was only two shifts that they were
working. When are they are going to start working for three
shifts for 24/7? That is what President Biden asked for, and it
seems like the port is still not doing it. So that is just
really a simple question. When, Mr. Cordero?
[No response.]
Mrs. Steel. I guess I don't see him here.
Mr. Stanton. Mr. Cordero, is he still on?
[Pause.]
Voice. No, he is gone.
Mr. Stanton. I am sorry, Congressmember Steel, he had to
leave. So, I apologize. So, we will ask him to submit answers
for the record, in written answers.
Mrs. Steel. So yes, I am going to just ask that--these are
the questions that--I am going to do written ones, but if
warehouse facilities are at capacity, how can drivers make
deliveries?
Do you think it was smart for cities to impose a moratorium
on new warehouses and truck facilities?
I need these answers from him later, so I am going to
submit this.
And then, Ms. Reinke, you mentioned, specifically, the
regulations from my home State of California promulgated
through the California Air Resources Board. What, at the
Federal level, can we do to rein in these regulations?
Ms. Reinke. Well, as you know, California has a waiver, and
so they can act without--sort of under their own authority.
Certainly, the Federal Government could remove that waiver.
That is one option.
But another, I think, really, is to try to right-size
regulations. And we want to work with the California Air
Resources Board to understand--we understand being
aspirational, but we also want to be pragmatic and practical.
If this renders capacity scarce, or if it removes business
opportunities from our members and they want to leave
California, that doesn't actually help the State, either.
So, if we can have a discussion with the State folks, and
there is an understanding and a mutual appreciation of that, I
think that will go a long way.
Mrs. Steel. OK, I appreciate that.
And then my third question is, Mr. Spear, you mentioned
that there is currently a provision in the PRO Act that would
effectively bar the trucking industry from utilizing the
independent contractor business model. Can you expand how a
similar provision in California affected this vital industry?
Because we have AB5 passed, and it has been implemented since
2019.
Mr. Spear. Yes, absolutely, Congresswoman. It is
essentially the same. It is codifying that, which is the same
issue, AB5, that is now being considered by the Supreme Court,
which just recently asked the Solicitor General to comment,
which is a good indicator that they are looking at taking it
up. So, I firmly believe that is the place to have this
decided, and we need to make certain that these laws take into
account all occupations, and the freedom of choice. And
independent contractors would be robbed that right, if this
were to proceed under AB5 or the PRO Act.
So, we want to preserve that. They choose that occupation
for a number of reasons. Let's let them have that right. If
they want to join a union, that is their decision, too.
Maintaining that balance is very, very important. That is what
I am referring to that has been preserved for multiple decades,
since the 1935 National Labor Relations Act. So, I firmly
believe that is the way it should be, and we shouldn't mess
with it.
Mrs. Steel. Thank you very much.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you. I now recognize Congressmember
Bourdeaux for 5 minutes.
Ms. Bourdeaux. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this
hearing today.
We have all seen, firsthand, the negative implications of
the ongoing supply chain challenges on public trust and on the
economy. It is clear from today's testimony that more work
needs to be done to ensure that, in the long term, we have a
supply chain that is resilient, and can be flexible to global
incidents.
In October I introduced the bipartisan Supply CHAIN Act,
H.R. 5479, with Representatives Kinzinger and Robin Kelly,
which would establish an Office of Supply Chain Resiliency and
Crisis Response within the Department of Commerce to monitor
supply chains of critical goods and materials, and plan for and
respond to supply chain distributions.
It is clear from everyone's testimony today that it is
going to take all of us to fix our supply chain and make it
resilient over the long term. My bill would encourage
partnerships and collaboration between the Federal Government,
industry, labor organizations, and State and local governments.
My question is for Mr. Regan.
Can you speak to the importance of a coordinated response
to the supply chain challenges?
Why is it important for labor organizations to be included
in these conversations?
And how could the Federal Government, using an office like
this, help build better coordination across the different
actors who are involved in supply chain decisions?
Mr. Regan. Thank you for that question. I think it is
vitally important that we have a comprehensive approach to all
this, that takes in all the various industries and factions or
factors of our supply chain. And I think you see many of the
people testifying today would argue the exact same thing. I
mean, we need to be coordinating here across trucking, rail,
maritime ports, warehouses to make sure that we are that we are
addressing this problem systematically, and not just piecemeal.
And I think labor is an important voice in all that, and it
is something I said in my testimony, where our members are the
ones on the ground. They see, in realtime, where the
chokepoints are, where the backlogs are, where the processes
that aren't quite working are contributing to the problems--are
really playing a huge role. So, I think it needs to be a
comprehensive conversation with business and labor. And
together, I do believe we can find some very meaningful changes
to this, to solve this problem for the long term.
Ms. Bourdeaux. Thank you so much. I yield back.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much. I now recognize
Congressmember Fitzpatrick for 5 minutes.
Mr. Fitzpatrick. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My question is
for Mr. Regan.
Mr. Regan, thank you for being here with us today.
Incentives are a powerful force in attracting people to jobs,
and we need men and women working now, more than ever. Mr.
Regan, do you think that better incentives in freight rail and
trucking jobs would help to solve the supply chain crisis?
And if so, what kind of incentives do you find to be most
effective?
Mr. Regan. Yes, and thank you so much for the question,
Congressman.
Certainly. I think one of the reasons we are seeing people
leave the workforce or not being attracted to these industries
is because the compensation is just not there for what is,
admittedly, very difficult and very hard work. So, I think job
stability, better safety protections on the workplace, higher
wages and benefits, all of these are important parts of making
sure that we build and retain a skilled workforce in these
industries.
Mr. Fitzpatrick. Thank you, sir.
Secondly, there has been a lot of talk about the PRO Act
today. Obviously, as you are aware, sir, I am a proud original
cosponsor of it. Mr. Regan, do you think there would be more
employment stability in many supply chain jobs if the PRO Act
became law?
And if so, how could that stability help to end the current
supply chain crisis?
Mr. Regan. Yes. And again, thank you for your cosponsorship
and your leadership on this issue. It has always been
refreshing to hear you talk about this one.
One of the things that the PRO Act does is--I think what is
really important--is properly classify the relationship between
employers and employees. Part of that important relationship
means that you have an opportunity to obtain things like
retirement benefits, healthcare, better salaries, the right to
collectively bargain, not necessarily forcing someone to join a
union, but giving them a greater opportunity to join a union,
if they choose to do so.
When you do that--and we have seen this across many
industries--wages for all people, whether union or nonunion,
they go up whenever we are able to see improvements in the
employment standards. You see that on the aviation side,
frankly, where we have a very, very high union density, and
still very highly profitable private airlines, where the
standards across the board are increased because of the high
union density we have there. And that is the reason why you see
increasing numbers of people choosing to join unions in that
industry.
I would argue that labor is not an enemy. We don't want to
drive away business. In fact, we want to work with our
employers to create stronger businesses, and grow our economy,
and create more jobs. And we can do that, especially when we
are able to have a seat at the table, and we are not just
operating on unfair labor standards or labor practices, which
have been in existence for years now.
Mr. Fitzpatrick. Thank you, Mr. Regan.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much. I now recognize
Congressmember Wilson for 5 minutes.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you, Chairman DeFazio, for
today's hearing. I am so proud to be one of the five Democratic
cosponsors of the historic Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act, and I am just so proud to do that.
Mr. Regan, how will this infrastructure investment in IIJA,
like the $2.2 billion provided for the Port Infrastructure
Development Program, be critical in preventing supply chain
problems in the future?
As chair of the Florida Ports Caucus, I am proud of this
accomplishment.
Mr. Regan. Thank you, Congresswoman. And yes, thank you for
your leadership on this issue.
As I have mentioned earlier, multimodal connectivity has
been a sustained problem, and one of the reasons why we--that
it--we have contributed to congestion and delay in our freight
systems.
Sixty-seven percent of ports say that funding is the single
largest obstacle to constructing essential freight rail
connectors at the ports, and nearly half of all U.S. ports say
that better rail access would increase the throughput capacity
by 25 percent. This investment, the direct investment through
this $2.2 billion, would help address that issue, give more
ports access to the type of facilities they need to be more
responsive to the increase in freight, and be better able to
move the freight off the ports and into the rest of the
country. So, thank you very much.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you.
Ms. Reinke, I know the supply chain workforce has
significantly decreased in recent years. Do you have any
recommendations on ways to increase the workforce?
Ms. Reinke. Congresswoman, thank you for the question. Yes,
we have had trouble, as all of our industries have,
necessarily, of attracting people into the workforce.
One of the things that we are looking at is, are there
programs at universities that can, like MIT's, make logistics
and transportation jobs more understandable to new recruits,
people who are just coming out of school? We would love to
attract them. That is a number-one issue for our members, is
recruiting people into the workforce for really high-quality,
great jobs.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you.
Mr. Jefferies, with the IIJA now enacted, how will the
significant investment in our Nation's railroads help the
industry tackle the current supply chain challenges?
Mr. Jefferies. Well, thank you for that, Congresswoman.
I think it is important to remind everybody again that, by
and large, freight rail is privately financed, privately
invested. But you are absolutely right, that we need a fully
invested, integrated supply chain.
And so, my colleague, Mr. Regan, mentioned those intermodal
connectors at ports. We think those are huge opportunities for
investment, huge opportunities to get more goods moving by rail
out of the ports. And, quite frankly, the supply chain and the
integrated infrastructure network won't work unless we are
fully investing across both the private and the public side of
it.
So, we support the legislation. We think there is a lot of
great opportunities to put dollars to work and make real
progress here.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you so much.
Mr. Spear, how will the IIJA's investment in the highway
system and workforce development, which was just signed by
President Biden, help the trucking industry fix these issues?
Mr. Spear. Well, that is huge, Congresswoman, absolutely
huge. We are talking a 38-percent increase each year in road
and bridge funding. That is historic. It has never happened
before, so that is very profound. It is something we have
waited for a long time to get. That is our shop floor. That is
where we get the job done all across the country and in every
congressional district, including yours. So, we are thrilled
about that.
And it is also going to allow States to plan. So, no more
of this patch every year. They can now plan big-ticket projects
1, 2, 3, 4 years out, with the certainty that they are going to
get the money. So, you are going to see major bottlenecks and
congestion in your State go down, and a lot more movement of
freight and getting customers and--food and so on, on the
shelves much quicker. So, these are all good things.
And I go along with what Ian and Greg said about those
intermodal connectors at the ports. Those are a big deal, 70
percent of those in the country are local and State
jurisdiction. The money has got to get down there. Because if
you look at the heat maps on where the congestion is, it is in
those corridors. So, this is really going to go a long way,
through the IIJA, to get that money where it is needed most,
and alleviate that congestion.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you so much.
Mr. Cordero, how can we ensure that the workers are
properly supported, so this framework can have a strong
foundation to succeed?
And what role can the Federal Government play?
[No response.]
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Mr. Cordero?
Mr. Garamendi [presiding]. Mr. Cordero, you are up.
Voice. He had to leave.
Mr. Garamendi. Mr. Cordero has left, and your time has
expired. But it was a very good question.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Garamendi. I now recognize Mr. Stanton--excuse me, Mr.
Mast for 5 minutes.
Mr. Mast. That is OK.
Mr. Garamendi. It is your turn.
Mr. Mast. I understand. I also had a question for Mr.
Cordero, the port director for Long Beach, which allows for
about 40 percent of those containers to come into our country.
He is not here, so I guess I would rather make a little bit
of a statement on that, because I can't ask him a question. And
it would simply be an advice that those shippers overseas,
given the difficulty that it can be to manifest ships once they
have left their point of origin with CBP and other agencies,
that they highly consider moving some of those vessels towards
Florida.
Florida, as of today, has capacity for about 4 million
containers right now, can move ships that contain up to 14,000
TEUs. And I want to say I believe it is real-time information
that the Port of Long Beach has a backlog of about 111
containerships as of today. So, I would make that
recommendation for those looking to depart Asia, to consider
moving to the ports of Florida: Miami, Port Everglades, Tampa,
Jacksonville, Palm Beach, the ports there.
[To Mr. Garamendi:] You consider that a shameless plug,
don't you?
My colleague next to me is laughing about this.
I think it is important to consider that, when you look at
that backlog of what is going on there. But because Mr. Cordero
isn't here, I will just touch on a couple of other things,
because they are likely coming to a head this Friday, with what
is known--or what is labeled as--Build Back Better. And I would
ask a couple of open-ended questions to the remainder of our
panelists.
Do any of our panelists see 80,000 IRS workers as a part of
improving or fixing our broken supply chain?
[No response.]
Mr. Mast. Or maybe I could ask it another way. Do any of
you panelists believe that those 80,000 additional IRS workers
are going to be there to help expedite refunds to individuals
and businesses and others, or are they there to help collect?
Mr. Regan. Congressman, I can't speak to what the IRS
employees will be doing, but I do know that there is $5 billion
in there directly that will be spent on addressing the supply
chain issue, and that is not going to be going through the IRS,
that is going to be going through appropriate port funding
channels.
Mr. Mast. Thank you for speaking up, Mr. Regan. Of that $5
billion, would you say that the $200 million going to Speaker
Pelosi's Presidio Park would be part of that $5 billion that
you are adding up, or is that something different?
Mr. Regan. I am restricting my comments to the money that
will address the supply chain, which is, again, the subject of
this hearing.
Mr. Mast. So, it would be fair to say those $200 million in
that program would not be addressing the supply chain. That
would be a fair thing to say, Mr. Regan, in your opinion?
Mr. Regan. I am not going to comment on any of the other
aspects of the bill. I will say that there is $5 billion in
there to address supply chain problems at our ports.
Mr. Mast. This $200 million for the park, does that help
the supply chain?
Mr. Regan. Again, I am not going to comment on the $200
million on the park.
Mr. Mast. This is the kind of stuff that pisses people off
around the United States of America. They know perfectly well
that $200 million to Pelosi's park doesn't do a thing to help
build back better, or help America's supply chain, or
Thanksgiving, or Christmas, or any business or corporation, or
anybody that wants to get a good or anything else from A to B.
And you are sitting here, pretending as though you don't have
an answer to it. You really just don't want to answer the
question. People are not ignorant to that fact. But----
Mr. Regan. Sir, with all due respect, that is a large bill,
and we support the bill. There is also really significant money
for transit in that bill, and transit training operations,
which we support.
As you know, there are a lot of priorities, including
environmental issues. There is a lot of issues in there for
different aspects of our economy that, frankly, many of the
people in the majority believe we need to address. So, all of
those are not going to address supply chain. Your question was
about whether that specific one would address supply chain. No,
and neither would the transit money.
But right now, the subject of this hearing is supply chain,
and there is $5 billion that will go through the Department of
Commerce specifically to address a supply chain crisis.
Mr. Mast. I appreciate you addressing my question directly.
It took a couple of minutes, but I appreciate you doing it,
nonetheless. In that I will note this: I did not hear in
anybody's testimony--I only have a few seconds remaining--I did
not note in anybody's testimony anybody quoting Transportation
Secretary Pete Buttigieg saying that the reason that we have
these supply chain issues is because the President has
successfully guided the economy out of the teeth of a
terrifying recession. I didn't hear that in anybody's
testimony.
And in that my time is expired, and I thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you, Mr. Mast.
Mr. Stanton, you have 5 minutes.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Until the
COVID pandemic, most people gave little thought to the various
levels of the supply chain that got the goods they needed and
wanted delivered to their homes or near a store.
Today the supply chains, the bottlenecks, the increased
prices, are the topics of many conversations in Arizona and
throughout the country. Everyone--shippers, transporters,
workers, businesses, and consumers--is feeling the impacts
caused by a disruption unlike anything we have seen in recent
times. Cargo ships docked off the coast of California, a
traffic jam waiting for the chance to unload, has become a
common sight, along with ports packed with containers. Each
level of supply chain has been affected.
Those businesses fortunate enough to receive the goods they
have ordered, they have had no choice but to adjust accordingly
to account for the delays in shipping and associated storage
costs that have increased dramatically. Bottom-line: consumers
are feeling the impacts of prices straining already tight
budgets many families are facing.
There is not just one cause of this disruption, it is a
perfect storm, a global pandemic that shut down factories that
produced goods for the U.S. market, a further reduction in the
number of seagoing routes and vessels to deliver cargo, and a
surge in consumer spending on durable goods that caused a spike
in shipping demand, among other causes, as well.
The short-term challenge is untangling the stranglehold
this disruption currently has on the supply chain. But at the
same time, we can't take our focus off of long-term solutions
to secure the supply chain and ensure its resiliency, going
forward.
I did have a series of questions for Mr. Cordero.
Unfortunately, he was not able to stay for the hearing. I will
ask that those questions be answered in writing for the record.
But I will ask a question for Mr. Regan. I know he has
answered similar questions previously, but please take the time
to answer it again.
What steps do you believe industry should be taking to
provide better resiliency in the supply chain?
Mr. Regan. Thank you for the question. Frankly, I think
investing in the workforce is going to be a critical part of
that. We need to expand capacity, and that means making sure
that we have the personnel to be able to do that, as well. I
think that is true in every aspect of the supply chain.
Also, building out in their physical infrastructure. And I
know the Government is going to make a very large investment to
help with some of that. But making sure that we have the
equipment that we need so that we can expand the workforce and
do it safely is going to be really important here.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you. And I have a little bit of
additional time, so I will open up that same question to any of
the other members of the panel. What steps should industry be
taking to provide better resiliency in the supply chain?
Mr. Spear. Well, I think, Congressman, the collaboration we
have been alluding to throughout this hearing is very important
amongst the modes. And you have seen this transformation over
the last 10, 15 years, where we do collaborate more.
Ian and I have been going back and forth, in terms of the
relationship between trucking and rail. It has grown stronger,
as a result of the integration of the supply chain, and we are
one of rail's biggest customers now. We are a partner.
We also really need a lot more transparency across all
modes. And I think, as we referred in the previous commentary
about digital transformation, that will really be key, in terms
of better visibility on where the chokepoints are, better
coordination, better throughput. Even if we don't have the
workforce that we need, increasing turns, for instance, is
going to elevate an increased capacity, and you don't need more
drivers to do that.
So, these efficiencies really are measurable, and they will
also help alleviate the driver shortage. So, these are all
things that I think are key amongst that collaboration.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you, Mr. Spear. Any of the other
witnesses want to give advice on that question?
Mr. Jefferies. Yes, I----
Mr. Stanton. What can we be doing to better provide
resiliency, please?
Mr. Jefferies. I think just sustained investment is key. We
didn't get here overnight. And in order to work out long-term
solutions--freight demand is only going to continue to grow in
this country. I know we are seeing unprecedented demand right
now on the international space, in particular, but freight
demand is going to continue to grow.
Between maximizing the use of the infrastructure we have
with sustained investments, utilizing technology to make that
use more efficient, increasing safety; obviously, dedication to
having well-skilled, well-trained employee bases in our
respective sectors--it is an all-of-the-above strategy that
requires a lot of coordination. And absolutely, visibility and
information sharing across the supply chain is the link to keep
all this together.
Ms. Reinke. Congressman, if I could, I will just go back
to----
Mr. Stanton. Please.
Ms. Reinke [continuing]. The three I's that I said at the
beginning of my testimony, which is investment, innovation, and
interaction amongst all the modes and stakeholders in the
supply chain.
I think all of us are doubling our efforts to invest as
much as we can, to innovate as much as we can, and you can see
how well I think we are collaborating across on this panel.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you for those outstanding answers. I
will yield back.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you, Mr. Stanton.
Mr. Graves, you are up next. You have 5 minutes.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First of all, I want to thank all of you for your endurance
today. I know this hearing is going on very long, and I also
know that you all have covered a lot of topics. I have had to
jump in and out today, so I hope that you haven't covered these
questions. But I am curious. All of the attention has been on
the backlog at the ports on the west coast. Mr. Correll earlier
in his testimony was talking about digitizing, or sort of
bringing technology to the transportation industry.
Ms. Reinke, I am curious. Why is it--or are there
opportunities to bring other ports into the fold to help
relieve some of the congestion that we are seeing on the west
coast?
Ms. Reinke. Yes, thank you, Congressman Graves, I
appreciate that question.
Sure. I think there are a lot of competitive ports all
across the east and west coast, and Congressman Mast just
touted a few in the State of Florida a few minutes ago, yes.
But if it is coming from Asia, typically it would just add
on costs to have it go further than California. So, it is not
that it is not an option. In fact, many beneficial cargo owners
and many of the retailers that we have talked about are already
doing that, just to get out of the congestion of the west coast
ports. But it just tacks on a little bit more expense, which
ends up getting passed on to the consumer.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Sure. But there is, obviously,
expense with the backlog, as well.
And I appreciate Mr. Mast bringing it up. Florida does have
a couple of cute little ports, but we have 5 of the top 15
ports in America, which I think is important to bring up.
And while we are talking to you, I do want to apologize
about Mr. Davis earlier in the hearing. I know that he was
talking about something over your shoulder, and because it
looked like he was really struggling with substantive
questions, I was trying to give him some ideas, but he didn't
take the call.
But let me jump back in. So, could you talk a little bit
again--I know that some of you all covered this earlier--about
some of the issues about the chassis and the containers, and
just kind of the adaptability of those, how that is further
complicating the supply chain issues that we are experiencing?
And also, I have heard folks bring up this dwell issue, as
well, where containers are sitting out kind of longer before
they are cycling back into the system.
Mr. Jefferies. Is that for anybody?
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Yes, sure, yes.
Mr. Jefferies. All right. Well, Congressman, that--I mean,
you are hitting the nail on the head. And my gosh, that is
probably an hour-long answer from all of us. We will try to
condense into about 30 seconds. But----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Now, of course, you are talking
about Rodney Davis being----
Mr. Jefferies. Yes, right.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. OK, just wanted to----
Mr. Jefferies. No, that is more of a--you know, it would
take longer than that.
What happens--and I will just speak from the rail
experience, and what we were seeing August timeframe in some of
the large, intermodal yards in the central part of the
country--is you had volumes coming in from the west coast at a
rate that were exceeding the ability of containers to be taken
out of the yards.
In other words, you are only able to get so much out of the
yard, and that what is coming in is overwhelming that. And at
one time, 1 railroad had over 20 trains of intermodal parked
outside of the Chicago terminal.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Wow.
Mr. Jefferies. And that is an equipment issue, because it
is a misplaced equipment issue. One, those are containers that
are just sitting there. Two, those are locomotives that are
stranded assets that should be going back, taking empty
containers back to the west coast, picking up more goods,
bringing it back. And that just starts to back up the entire
system.
On the chassis side, if you go to Chicagoland right now
around all the yards, every single warehouse has a for-hire
sign. But also, you see containers sitting on chassis in the
parking lots because the warehouses are full. And so, again,
those are chassis that aren't getting their turns in and coming
back for more pickups. They are sitting there, not being used.
And so that has a very quick reverberating effect throughout
the entire supply chain.
And I am sure Chris could tell you the same type of
situation. It affects all of us.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Yes, actually, Mr. Spear, I would
love to jump in--maybe a little bit different question for you.
I saw where the Ports of L.A. and Long Beach announced a fee to
be charged to ocean carriers for containers that dwell on
property for more than--I think it is 9 days for ocean, and
maybe 6 for rail, something like that. Can you talk a little
bit about how that may influence what we are seeing in supply
chain challenges right now?
Mr. Spear. Well, it is just not going to influence it,
because it is not going to make it any more efficient.
Penalizing people, when we know what the problem is--and Ian
just perfectly outlined it--it is turn time. It is getting more
space, the ability to stack more.
They were limiting it to two in California. They had to
lift that local ordinance, so you could double the stack, just
because we didn't have enough yard space to put all the empties
and the full containers.
So, we need more room, moving more inland. And positioning
in open space next to rail, next to us, where we can have more
capability to move the containers is really critical. And you
can do a lot of that with efficiency, and it will help address
and alleviate the driver shortage, because if you can improve
turn times, you are moving more throughput. And that is,
obviously, a tremendous benefit, very measurable.
So, getting those inefficiencies out of that chokepoint are
absolutely essential. I think we are all pretty well aligned on
that.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. And thank----
Mr. Garamendi. Mr. Spear, thank you very much.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thanks again, all of you----
Mr. Garamendi. Your time has expired, Mr. Graves. Thank
you.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Garamendi. I recognize Mr. Garamendi for his 5 minutes.
There is going to be a lot of discussion about this
problem. We have already spent several hours at it, and I am
not sure we have come to a solution, because it is a
multifaceted problem. It extends all across the Nation. It also
extends from the fact that we, basically, were all at a stop
sign for a year or so. Suddenly, the light turned green, and
everybody hit the accelerator, and we are now all jammed up at
the next stoplight.
So, what can we do? There are some things that can be done
to address the known problems. Certainly, the transportation
bill that we have already discussed in this committee and was
signed by the President a couple of days ago--that bill will,
undoubtedly, provide solutions for the future, but not
immediate.
There are some things that we can do to deal with the
underlying problems that we have, a tremendous imbalance in
trade. And one of the things is to better utilize a Government
agency that, basically, has been without the power to address
some of the problems, but not all of them, and that would be
the Federal Maritime Commission. It has been around for a long
time. Its purpose in law, as established over many decades, is
to make sure that there is a fair balance of power within the
shippers from the United States and the importers into the
United States, and that the ocean shipping companies, carriers,
are involved in a way that is fair.
However, unfortunately, the Federal Maritime Commission
does not have the power to really enforce. It can do some
studies, but it can't enforce, and can't deal with the problem
of demurrage charges, which I was told by an importer of
Christmas trees and wreaths and the like, $4 million a day
because his containers containing those Christmas goods are at
the bottom of the stack of the four-high containers, and he is
being charged, in his view--and I would say in my view--
unfairly.
Nor from the exporters of rice, prunes, almonds, wine from
California, who cannot get an empty container because the empty
containers are--when they are available, are immediately put
back on the ocean carriers' ships, so that they can go back to
the Western Pacific--China, principally--and receive perhaps
several times--maybe 10 times more fee than if that ship, if
that container were available for the California exporters.
To deal with this, Congressman Dusty Johnson of South
Dakota and I have introduced a bill called the Ocean Shipping
Reform Act, H.R. 4996. It deals with this by providing a
mechanism in which the Federal Maritime Commission can operate
to create a fair playing field.
Importing into the United States is not a right, but it is
an opportunity, and it has to be an opportunity that is fair
both to the importers and the exporters, and one in which the
ocean carriers are acting responsibly.
So, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act--and this is a question
for Ms. Reinke--and I thank the Transportation Intermediaries
Association for their endorsement of this legislation, this
bipartisan legislation, which we think will soon be bicameral.
The bill does empower the Federal Maritime Commission to set
rules for marketplace competition and fairness, to ensure that
trade with countries in Asia and the Pacific region is
reciprocal, and that foreign-flagged ocean carriers provide
reasonable opportunities for American exporters willing to pay
for a privilege.
Ms. Reinke, we thank you for your support of the bill. And
if you would care to comment on it, I would appreciate it.
Ms. Reinke. Well, thank you, Congressman. Your staff and
the staff of Congressman Johnson did such a tremendous job
explaining the legislation and having our members understand
it. It was so compelling, we sort of endorsed it there, on the
spot. So, we appreciate that.
The fact is these shipping laws haven't been modernized in
20 years. You are looking to establish a fair playing field.
That is really, I think, all anyone would ask. We appreciate
your attention to that issue and, hopefully, that can really
unlock some of the congestion and some of the problems that we
are seeing in the ports. So, we appreciate it.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you very much for your response. We
hope to move this bill expeditiously before the Christmas
holidays. It may not solve the problem, but it will certainly
be a wakeup call, or a slap across the bow of the ocean
carriers and those that are operating in an unfair way, that
the reform is coming.
With that I yield back my remaining time and turn to Mr.
Johnson.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Well, Mr. Chairman, I would
start by associating myself with your comments on the Ocean
Shipping Reform Act. I am proud to lead it with you. Your
leadership has been critically important. We built a lot of
momentum, 200 national groups have endorsed this piece of
legislation, dozens of our colleagues on both sides of the
aisle have signed on as cosponsors. And I, like you, share your
optimism for building progress toward this, even before the end
of the year, and continuing to move this forward. So, well
said, Mr. Garamendi.
And then, Mr. Chair, secondly, I would like to ask
unanimous consent to insert a statement from the Shippers
Coalition into the record. I believe your staff already has a
copy, sir.
Mr. Garamendi. Without objection, so ordered.
[The information follows:]

Statement of the Shippers Coalition, Submitted for the Record by
Hon. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota
The pervasiveness of our supply chain issues has been widely
reported and impacts all links in the chain between producers and end
customers. One critical segment of the supply chain that must be
addressed is the shipment of goods over the road via trucking. As the
supply chain challenges continue to persist, one solution that could
immediately allow goods to be moved quicker in a safe and
environmentally friendly manner is increasing the gross vehicle weight
limit (GVW) on Federal Interstates.
Currently, many shippers reaching the current 80,000-pound weight
limit before the truck is full and are forced to send trucks out that
are only three fourths of the way full, requiring companies to send
more trucks out than what otherwise is necessary to meet the current
demand. This situation adds to roadway congestion, contributes to
slowdowns in the supply chain, and leads to an unnecessary increase in
carbon emissions.
Companies across the United States have already proven that they
can implement this safely. A provision of the CARES Act allowed states
to issue permits allowing trucks to operate above federal weight limits
on Interstates during the COVID-19 crisis to provide much-needed
supplies to families and communities. While this waiver authority was
only available for 120 days, companies across the US were able to take
advantage of this provision and found an increase in efficiency and a
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions with no increased safety risk
when they were able to fill trucks to a higher capacity.
Underscoring all of this is safety. The companies who took
advantaged of the waiver authority had no additional safety concerns or
additional reportable accidents as a result of the additional payload.
One company that was able to take advantage of this waiver was able to
put an additional 4,500 pounds on each truckload, which equated to a
reduction in total truckloads in one state by 10%. This company was
able to deliver an additional 1.8 million bottles in the same number of
shipments and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 68,000 pounds. A
second company was able to increase its vehicle capacity by an average
of 2,786 pounds per shipment. This reduced shipments by 600, the miles
traveled by 51,472 miles, and CO2 emissions by 165,000 pounds, just
because of the increased capacity of the vehicles. A third company
saved 2.78 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) or 6,121
pounds of carbon dioxide, reduced the need for 54.6 trucks to move the
same amount of material, saved 272 gallons of diesel, and saved 1,576
miles of driving. A fourth company conducted outreach to a group of its
small- and medium-sized (SME) carriers and found that none reported an
increase in reportable accidents, and one carrier reported that
approximately 23 percent of their loads were over 80,000-pounds. If the
GVW limit was increased to 91,000-pounds on six axles, we would see
these benefits across the industry and the easing of some of the
current constraints on the supply chain.
Congress should enact a common-sense pilot program that would
modestly increase GVW limits on Federal Interstates to 91,000-pounds on
six axles.

Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Very good. And then, finally,
I have got a question for Mr. Spear.
Mr. Spear, I appreciated your mention of the DRIVE Safe Act
pilot program, which, as has been mentioned a number of times
today, would allow safe drivers under 21 who are accustomed to
driving intrastate to also drive interstate, across State
lines. And as you note, 49 States already allow these drivers
to go out and help our economy run, driving. And if you can
drive all over South Dakota, why can't you drive from South
Dakota over the State line into Iowa?
I am not sure that has ever made sense to me, and that is
why I led 80 of my colleagues in urging the administration to
implement this program. And of course, as you know, sir, I
appreciate ATA's support of our efforts.
Beyond that, of course, I am committed to pursuing any
avenue to try to make our system run more efficiently, and to
make better use of these great driving resources, these great
trucking resources. And that is why I was quite surprised and
more than a little concerned to read of some of the purported
inefficiencies detailed in Mr. Correll's testimony. And so, Mr.
Spear, I just wanted to give you an opportunity to add your
analysis and your thoughts related to that MIT study and
report.
Mr. Spear. I appreciate that, Congressman. And just at the
outset, I want to echo and support--ATA supports the bill that
you and Congressman Garamendi have introduced on ocean shipping
reform. It is an outstanding piece of legislation, so I commend
you both for your leadership on that, and on the DRIVE Safe
Act.
And to your question, I have looked at that study and,
quite candidly, there is a difference between academia and
reality, and I am not bashing academia, and certainly not going
to bash Dr. Correll or MIT. It is an outstanding school.
But my world is in the reality, and the people that I deal
with are real, hard-working people, and they choose different
lines of work within our industry, which is extraordinarily
diverse. We are talking 1 in 18 jobs in the U.S. is trucking-
related, and the top job in 29 States is a truckdriver. So,
this is a powerhouse, in terms of moving freight. We move, in
trucks, 72.5 percent of the domestic freight in this country,
so no small task.
So, when we talk about underutilization, I don't honestly
know what the heck that means, because there are over 6 million
people in this country that have a CDL. That doesn't mean they
are an active driver. They could be retired. They could be
part-time--you know, my safety policy vice president has a CDL.
He doesn't drive, but he is counted in that number.
So, you really have to dig deep, and diversify the various
segments within our industry to understand what is working,
what is not, why they come back into the workforce, why they
leave, the type of segment that they want to drive for, whether
it be long haul or short haul where they are home at night
every night with their families.
So, this is a very diverse question that is not easily
answered, and you really have to spend some time, Congressman,
with real people, like in your district, to understand the ins
and outs, and why they make the choices they do. So, I just
really struggle to see how that could be captured in one
report.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Well, and I think a lot of
that is well said----
Mr. Correll. Congressman, may I reply?
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota [continuing]. I mean, I would
note that Mr. Correll's analysis indicated that increasing the
amount of actual drive time on any given day by the people who
are currently driving, the 1.8 million, not the 6 million,
would be equivalent to adding 80,000 drivers. Well, if that is
even close to true, that could be a powerful part of the
solution.
And so I would just say to you, Mr. Spear, Mr. Correll,
anybody else, if there are things that our Federal Government
or that State governments are doing that makes it harder for
drivers to dedicate their time during their day to actually
moving freight, you have just got to let us know, because it
just won't be a Republican passion, it won't just be a
Democratic passion. You will find nearly every member of this
committee committed to finding safe ways to get safe drivers
driving more.
By all means, let's get new drivers in the industry. But
let's better utilize these unbelievably talented professionals.
Mr. Spear. And I appreciate that, and I think we have got
to----
Mr. Correll. I agree on the point of underutilization, but
I am afraid Mr. Spear has mischaracterized our study in his
comments.
Mr. Garamendi. Well, thank you very much.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Mr.----
Mr. Garamendi. Mr. Johnson?
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota [continuing]. The question----
Mr. Garamendi. Mr. Johnson?
Mr. Spear. Just to be fair, if I could very quickly respond
to it.
Mr. Garamendi. Excuse me, gentlemen. You have had your
chance, and you may have your chance again, because Mr.
Johnson's time has expired. I will leave the two of you. We
will get you your common telephone numbers, and you can
complete that debate.
Miss Gonzalez-Colon, I yield 5 minutes to you.
Miss Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You mentioned
a few minutes ago the situation with the Federal Maritime
Commission, and I agree in some of the points you made. But I
understand that, under Commissioner Rebecca Dye, she led the
industry--stood up voluntary working groups to help address
poor performance and tried to come up with commonsense
solutions to improve efficiencies. And I think that is
something the committee should promote to allow the private
sector and labor unions to come up with a lot of those
solutions.
And I say this because, as Puerto Rico, many people know,
we depend on the port industry. We depend on everything being
shipped to Puerto Rico. And right now, we have been facing,
from August to now, a lot of strikes in one of the ports from
the international shipments going to the island. So, we do
know, firsthand, how issues like automation and efficiencies
are important.
And in that sense--I know Mr. Cordero is not with us
anymore, but I do have some questions, and I will begin with
Mr. Spear.
Mr. Spear, I appreciate your testimony highlighting the
need for workforce development. And to address workforce
development and increase safety, I have introduced H.R. 1967,
which will allow Puerto Rico to issue commercial driver's
licenses to truckdrivers in Puerto Rico. And it will require
drivers to increase their skills while operating a motor
carrier and give anyone moving to or from Puerto Rico a license
that they could use anywhere in the country.
I asked your organization to review this legislation for
their support, but I haven't received an answer yet, either
way. So, can you give a response to my office?
Mr. Spear. I absolutely will get you a response to your
office expeditiously.
Miss Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you. And because I serve in this
committee, and we have experienced what happened in Puerto Rico
with the devastation of hurricanes and, of course, earthquakes
last year, the infrastructure network was devastated. And we
know how important and critical roads and bridges are for those
connections and port operations, as well.
The American Society of Civil Engineers decided that Puerto
Rico needed more than $3 billion to bring our network just to
good repair. And you say that you advocate for $5 billion in
annual funding to address bottlenecks. And I assume that this
is to ensure competitive, but efficient use of those funds in
the whole Nation.
My concern at this time is how we get--you know, we
approved the infrastructure bill a few days ago, the President
signed it, but there are still a lot of areas that we can
improve with the proper information, using technology. And one
of those is having and getting real-time port metrics that can
help the industry to schedule accordingly, to make the whole
system efficient as possible. One of those is using technology.
And my question to you is, do you agree that using real-
time reporting from ports to know--we were discussing a few
minutes ago the problem with chassis in several ports. There
would be a shortage in the Port of Los Angeles, but a surplus
in the Port of Long Beach, and we have got the same situations.
We have many surpluses of those chassis, as well. Can you share
your comments on that?
Mr. Spear. Congresswoman, who is the question posed to?
Miss Gonzalez-Colon. To you and to Ms. Reinke.
Mr. Spear. OK, yes, that is fine. Yes, I think, as we have
been discussing, making certain that we have more technology
that provides that transparency is really a good investment in
innovation and transparency and efficiencies. And these are all
things that intermodals need to coordinate on and ensure
happen, going forward. So, I think there is quite a bit of
improvements that could be made to really alleviate some of the
pressures we are seeing from shortages in talent.
So, I think, if you can offset that with technology, that
is a good solution.
Miss Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you, and I will also submit some
questions for the record, but I would love to have Mr.
Jefferies tell me if there are any deregulatory actions that
could alleviate the burden on freight railroads.
Mr. Jefferies. Well, I think I would say more regulatory
modernization is the goal. Let's really think about how we can
utilize technology to maximize safety, maximize efficiency. And
it should be a cooperative effort.
Sometimes there is a knee-jerk reaction against deploying
new technologies and building datasets to demonstrate that
there is a safety improvement, but it is something that we
should all be working towards the same end, and that is safety,
that is efficiency, that is service. And so, let's look at ways
to modernize the regulatory paradigm that really enables us to
thrive with technology. Thank you.
Miss Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you, my time expired.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you, Miss Gonzalez-Colon.
That ends the questions by the Members, but it doesn't end
the comment that the chair of the committee wants to make with
regard to the witnesses.
Mr. Cordero from Long Beach, Mr. Spear with the American
Trucking Associations, Mr. Jefferies from the Association of
American Railroads, and Ms. Reinke, Mr. Correll, and Mr. Regan,
all of you have been at this for 5 hours, and we owe you a debt
of gratitude for the information that you have delivered to the
committee. The committee takes this issue extremely seriously,
and we will be looking for short-term and long-term solutions.
And with that, I would like to ask unanimous consent that
the record of today's hearing remain open until such time as
our witnesses have provided answers to any questions that may
have been submitted to them in writing.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 days for any additional comments and information
submitted by the Members or witnesses to be included in the
record of today's hearing.
Without objection so ordered.
With that, the committee stands adjourned. Thank you.
[Whereupon, at 3:18 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]

Letter of November 17, 2021, to Hon. Peter A. DeFazio, Chair and Hon.
Sam Graves, Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure, from Catherine Chase, President, Advocates for Highway
and Auto Safety, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Peter A. DeFazio
November 17, 2021.
The Honorable Peter DeFazio, Chair,
The Honorable Sam Graves, Ranking Member,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves:
Thank you for your leadership in holding today's hearing,
``Industry and Labor Perspectives: A Further Look at North American
Supply Chain Challenges.'' We respectfully request that this letter
from Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates) be included in
the hearing record.
Introduction
Advocates is a coalition of public health, safety, law enforcement,
and consumer organizations, insurers and insurance agents that promotes
highway and auto safety through the adoption of federal and state laws,
policies and regulations. Advocates is unique both in its board
composition and its mission of advancing safer vehicles, safer
motorists and road users, and safer roadway environments.
While our nation is facing numerous COVID-19 related challenges
regarding the supply chain and movement of goods, we also have
experienced a major surge in motor vehicle crash fatalities. Alarming
estimates recently released by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) indicate that crash fatalities have spiked to
more than 20,000 in the first half of 2021, representing a nearly 20
percent increase over the same time period the previous year. This is
the highest number of fatalities recorded during the first half of the
year since 2006 and the highest half-year increase identified by the
Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS).\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ All statistics are from the United States Department of
Transportation unless noted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every year over 500,000 truck crashes occur on our roads. They
result in deaths, injuries, lost productivity, closed roadways,
unfunded costs, expenditure of time and resources of first responders
as well as their endangerment, damage to infrastructure such as roads,
bridges and safety barriers, fuel consumption of delayed vehicles, and
increased emissions. Fatal truck crashes also continue to occur at a
disturbingly high rate. In 2020, nearly 5,000 people were killed in
crashes involving a large truck. Since 2009, the number of fatalities
in large truck crashes has increased by 45 percent. Additionally,
159,000 people were injured in crashes involving a large truck in 2019,
and injuries of large truck occupants increased by 18 percent over the
prior year. In fatal two-vehicle crashes between a large truck and a
passenger motor vehicle, 97 percent of the fatalities were occupants of
the passenger vehicle.\2\ The cost to society from crashes involving
commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) was estimated to be $143 billion in
2018, the latest year for which data is available.\3\

While concerns about sparsely stocked shelves for the holidays are
understandable, remembering the lesson George Bailey learned in the
Christmas classic ``It's a Wonderful Life'' that each life is
irreplaceable and its absence has many tragic ripple effects must be
paramount. Safety provisions in the Investing in a New Vision for the
Environment and Surface Transportation (INVEST) in America Act led by
this Committee, some of which were included in the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) signed into law this week, will
eradicate dangers on our nation's roadways. We urge you to continue
your leadership, commitment and efforts to end the massive motor
vehicle crash death and injury toll and to reject any action that
further endangers truck drivers and all road users.
Weakening Truck Safety Protections Will Needlessly Endanger Drivers and
the Public
In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Administration
has provided temporary exemptions from certain truck safety rules.
Advocates has continued to assert that any exemptions must be narrowly
tailored in time and scope with appropriate safeguards to protect truck
drivers as well as everyone sharing the roads with them including
construction workers, road maintenance crews, first responders and law
enforcement officers whose ``offices'' are also the roads. We have
strongly opposed enshrining temporary exemptions into statute and urge
transparency about their use by making any related data available to
the public.
Further, current issues involving the nation's supply chain have
highlighted problems that the trucking industry has not effectively
addressed for decades including high turnover rates and poor working
conditions. As noted in a recent segment on the television news show
``60 Minutes,'' the problems facing our nation's supply chain are
complex with the pandemic highlighting glaring deficiencies in
America's infrastructure. Correspondent Bill Whitaker explained,
``There is a lot of finger-pointing. The truckers blame the terminals.
The terminals blame the shippers. The retailers blame the truckers and
the shippers.'' \4\ Degradation of truck safety regulations will not
solve these issues. We urge the Committee to reject the following
special interest proposals that will jeopardize all road users.

``Teen Truckers'' pose a major safety threat. Some segments of the
trucking industry have been pushing to allow teenagers to operate CMVs
in interstate commerce for at least 20 years, often relying on their
own forecasts for the number of drivers needed, projections that have
consistently failed to materialize.\5\ Seeking to attach this effort to
current discussions on the supply chain is a facade that Congress
should not accept and certainly not use as the basis for drastic policy
changes to well established federal law. This ``band-aid'' solution
will not resolve the myriad of self-inflicted ``wounds'' underlying the
driver retention issue but rather will result in more ``blood'' shed on
our roadways.

Associations, Truck Driver Shortage Analysis 2015 (Oct. 2015).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The trucking industry is facing a driver retention crisis, not a
driver shortage. In fact, a March 2019 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS) analysis found that ``the labor market for truck drivers works
about as well as the labor markets for other blue-collar occupations''
and ``a deeper look [at the truck industry labor market] does not find
evidence of a secular shortage.'' \6\ Rather, industry data shows
driver turnover at some carriers is near 90 percent.\7\ As U.S.
Department of Transportation (DOT) Secretary Pete Buttigieg recently
noted, such a high rate of turnover is indicative that there are some
real issues with the quality of the job of driving a truck.\8\ In
addition, states issue more than 450,000 new commercial driver licenses
(CDLs) each year demonstrating that there are candidates to fill
vacancies.\9\ Instead of proposing initiatives that will degrade public
safety, the industry should be focused on addressing the retention
issues through improved, safe working conditions.

Younger drivers are demonstrated to be less safe. The Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), citing numerous studies, has
stated that ``age is a strong risk factor for truck crash
involvement.'' \10\ In fact, age is the most important factor in the
high rate of involvement of younger CMV drivers in fatal crashes. The
general pattern of over-involvement in fatal crashes for younger CMV
drivers dominates all other factors. Studies of young CMV drivers show
that as the age of the driver decreases, large truck fatal crash
involvement rates increase.\11\

CMV drivers under the age of 19 are four times more likely to be
involved in fatal crashes, as compared to CMV drivers who are 21 years
of age and older, and CMV drivers ages 19-20 are six times more likely
to be involved in fatal crashes (compared to CMV drivers 21 years and
older).\12\ This plain-truth reality is not surprising given that
generally younger drivers are more likely to be involved in fatal
crashes because they lack driving experience and skills, and tend to
take greater risks. Development of the brain region vital to decision
making, specifically the pre-frontal cortex, may not be fully reached
until one's mid-20s.\13\ While proponents of younger truck drivers have
justified this misguided policy proposal by citing state laws that
allow them to operate intrastate, expanding the operations of these
dangerous drivers extends existing safety problems while introducing
additional safety considerations such as unfamiliar terrain and weather
conditions.

Diverse stakeholders including safety groups, law enforcement,
public health and consumer organizations, truck drivers, labor unions,
some trucking companies, and truck crash victims and survivors oppose
efforts to lower the age to operate CMVs in interstate commerce.
Additionally, the public has rejected lowering the minimum age for
interstate truck and bus drivers with 62 percent of respondents in
opposition, according to a 2020 public opinion poll conducted by
Engine's Caravan Survey.\14\ Furthermore, in 2001, a petition was filed
with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to lower
the age at which a person could obtain a CDL to operate in interstate
commerce from 21 to 18 as part of a pilot program. The FMCSA declined
to lower the minimum age for an unrestricted CDL because the agency
could not conclude that the safety performance of younger drivers was
on par with, or even close to, that of older CMV drivers. In comments
to the docket for the petition, the public strongly rejected the idea
with 96 percent of individuals who responded opposing the proposal
along with 88 percent of the truck drivers and 86 percent of the motor
carriers.\15\

Relatedly, Advocates strongly opposes the Developing Responsible
Individuals for a Vibrant Economy, ``DRIVE-Safe,'' Act (S. 659/H.R.
1745) and ``teen trucker'' pilot programs. While at first glance some
provisions may seem to be pro-safety, the adverse could result.
Specifically, certain technologies, such as active braking collision
mitigation systems and speed limiters, are only required during the
scant probationary period. The result is a teen driver would initially
learn to drive in a truck fitted with this technology acting to curb
some dangerous outcomes but after the probationary period, she/he/they
could get behind the wheel of a truck without any of the safety
technology and its benefits. The teen driver is then at a deficit
lacking experience in safely operating trucks without the technology.
As a noted aside, we welcome the confirmation that the recommended
technology, for which Advocates has been pushing to be standard
equipment for many years including submitting a petition to NHTSA to do
so, provides safety benefits and hope the proponents of the bill will
join our efforts to accelerate the adoption of proven safety
technologies in all trucks.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\16\ 80 F.R. 62487 (Oct. 16, 2015).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further, the training proposals in this bill are woefully
inadequate. The first probationary period only consists of 80 hours of
behind-the-wheel training which can be completed in a little over one
work week while abiding by hours of service (HOS) requirements.
Further, the 160 hours of driving time in the second probationary
period can be covered in an additional two weeks. In comparison, the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires pilots working for
passenger airlines to have approximately 1,500 hours of flight time.
These paltry training requirements also pale in comparison to other
less dangerous jobs. For example, Oregon requires a licensed
electrician to have 576 hours of classroom training and 8,000 hours of
experience as an apprentice, and Missouri requires at least 4,000 hours
of experience as a certified journeyman plumber before applying for a
master plumber's license.
Additionally, the qualifications for a teen truck driver passing
the probationary periods are left entirely to the discretion of the
employer who is incentivized to get the driver on the road as soon as
possible. No standard tests or evaluations given by an independent
party are required. Furthermore, a teen truck driver who is involved in
a crash or is given a citation for a moving violation during the
probationary periods is not disqualified from continuing to operate a
truck.
Industry representatives have also argued that members of the
military who are of teenage years are permitted to be at the helm of a
naval aircraft carrier and thus, should be allowed to operate a truck
in interstate commerce. This assertion is an apples to oranges
comparison. First, a young person at the helm would have had a
significant amount of naval training that would include at least eight
weeks of intensive boot camp and six weeks of boatswains mate school.
In sharp contrast, the DRIVE-Safe Act requires a potential teen truck
driver to undergo approximately three weeks of behind-the-wheel
training. Second, a young person on an aircraft carrier would be under
the supervision and direction of a Captain. Not only are orders such as
turning a vessel directed by the Captain, but the Captain's decision to
instruct such a maneuver would be supported by a chain of command of
officers and enlisted men and women involved in navigation of the ship
through radar, sonar and numerous other functions. Moreover, trucks are
not equipped with highly sophisticated radar and other navigational
systems, are not staffed with specialists to monitor each system, and
do not have the movements of the driver directed by a team of support
staff constantly overseeing operations. Third and fourth, ships operate
most often in open waters and at speeds not exceeding 30 knots (less
than 35 miles per hour), which stands in stark contrast to densely
traveled highways and roads where trucks can operate at speeds up to 80
mph. The cartoon below similarly captures this type of comparison.\17\

Allowing teenagers to drive trucks in interstate commerce will
worsen and expand the major problems with truck driver working
conditions from inside state lines to the entire nation.
Improving working conditions to ensure experienced drivers stay on
the job, rather than tapping into an unsafe pool of teenage drivers to
fill the void, will ideally lead to healthier and more fulfilled
drivers as well as attract new applicants. In sum, attempts to pull
teenagers from high school hallways onto high speed highways should be
rejected by Congress.
Driver fatigue is a well-known and documented CMV safety problem.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has repeatedly cited
fatigue as a major contributor to truck crashes. Currently, truck
drivers are permitted to drive up to 11 hours per day for a total of 77
hours per week. These grueling hours can lead to cumulative fatigue and
devastating safety consequences. Self-reports of fatigue, which almost
always underestimate the problem, find that fatigue in truck operations
is a significant issue. In a 2006 driver survey prepared for FMCSA,
``65 percent [of drivers] reported that they often or sometimes felt
drowsy while driving'' and almost half (47.6 percent) of drivers said
they had fallen asleep while driving in the previous year.\18\
Expanding the hours truck drivers can drive in an attempt to move more
goods puts truck drivers, their loads and everyone on the roads with
them at risk.

In March 2020, FMCSA issued an emergency declaration that exempts
drivers providing direct assistance for relief efforts related to the
pandemic.\19\ The declaration was extended by the agency in May 2021
and again in August 2021 and is currently set to expire November 30,
2021.\20\ Advocates has called for the agency to be transparent about
the use of this exemption by making any related data available to the
public.\21\ To date, the agency has not responded or posted any data on
its website. It is essential to ensure this process intended to provide
narrow flexibility does not result in enhanced risks and danger.

One of the most effective tools to help prevent driver fatigue is
the use of Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs) to record drivers' HOS.
Paper logs are frequently referred to as ``comic books'' throughout the
industry because of the ease in falsifying actual driving and work
time. The FMCSA estimated that requiring ELDs will save 26 lives,
prevent over 500 injuries and avoid over 1,800 crashes annually. The
U.S. DOT also estimated the annualized net benefits of adopting ELDs to
be over $1 billion.\22\ Congress, recognizing the benefits of ELDs,
mandated their use as part of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st
Century (MAP-21) Act.\23\ In 2015, the FMCSA delivered on this
Congressional directive and issued a rule requiring the use of ELDs
which went into effect in December 2017.\24\ FMCSA reports that since
the implementation of the ELD rule, the percentage of driver
inspections with an HOS violation has decreased significantly.\25\
Despite this compelling evidence, broad support and an established
final rule, some continue to object to the use of this technology.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is important to note that the ELD rule did not change the
underlying HOS rules. Yet, a barrage of legislative and regulatory
proposals continues to target these regulations. For instance, truck
drivers hauling livestock or insects are currently exempted from having
to use ELDs pursuant to provisions tucked into the Fiscal Year 2021
Further Consolidated Appropriations Act.\26\ In addition, the IIJA
expands the HOS exemption provided to these carriers to a 150 air-mile
radius from the final destination (the current exemption is for a 150
air-mile radius from the source).\27\ Allowing certain haulers to skirt
the ELD rules jeopardizes the safety of the animals in transport, truck
drivers and everyone on the roads with them. It also complicates
enforcement efforts. Section 4306 of the INVEST in America Act advanced
by this Committee required FMCSA to determine the impact all HOS
exemptions have on public safety. Unfortunately, this prudent provision
was not included in the IIJA.\28\ We hope this Committee will revisit
this measure in the future to inform needed reforms to the HOS
regulations.

Additionally, in 2016, the FMCSA published an Advanced Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) requesting information regarding the
potential benefits of regulatory action to address the safety risks
posed by CMV drivers who are afflicted with obstructive sleep apnea
(OSA).\29\ Compelling and consistent research has revealed that drivers
afflicted with OSA that is not properly treated are more prone to
fatigue and have a higher crash rate than the general driver
population. In fact, the FAA considers OSA to be a disqualifying
condition unless properly treated.\30\ Yet, in August of 2017 the FMCSA
withdrew the OSA rulemaking without providing any credible analysis or
reasoning for such an ill-advised course of action.\31\ Advocates was
pleased that Section 4308 of the INVEST in America Act advanced by this
Committee addressed this critical safety issue, although such language
was not included in the IIJA.\32\

Overweight trucks disproportionately damage America's crumbling
infrastructure and threaten public safety. While certain special
interests are advocating to suspend federal limits on the weight and
size of CMVs in response to the current supply chain issues, these laws
are essential to protecting truck drivers, the traveling public, and
our nation's roads and bridges.
According to the 2021 Infrastructure Report Card from the American
Society of Civil Engineers, America's roads receive a grade of ``D''
and our bridges were given a ``C''.\33\ Nearly 40 percent of our
615,000 bridges in the National Bridge Inventory are 50 years or older,
and one out of 11 is structurally deficient.\34\ The U.S. DOT
Comprehensive Truck Size and Weight Study found that introducing double
33-foot trailer trucks, known as ``Double 33s,'' would be projected to
result in 2,478 bridges requiring strengthening or replacement at an
estimated one-time cost of $1.1 billion.\35\ This figure does not even
account for the additional, subsequent maintenance costs which will
result from longer, heavier trucks. In fact, increasing the weight of a
heavy truck by only 10 percent increases bridge damage by 33
percent.\36\ The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) estimates that
the investment backlog for bridges, to address all cost-beneficial
bridge needs, is $123.1 billion.\37\

Raising truck weight or size limits could result in an increased
prevalence and severity of crashes. Longer trucks come with operational
difficulties such as requiring more time to pass, having larger blind
spots, crossing into adjacent lanes, swinging into opposing lanes on
curves and turns, and taking a longer distance to adequately brake. In
fact, double trailer trucks have an 11 percent higher fatal crash rate
than single trailer trucks.\38\ Overweight trucks also pose serious
safety risk. Not surprisingly, trucks heavier than 80,000 pounds have a
greater number of brake violations, which are a major reason for out-
of-service violations.\39\ According to a North Carolina study by IIHS,
trucks with out-of-service violations are 362 percent more likely to be
involved in a crash.\40\ This is also troubling considering that
tractor-trailers moving at 60 miles per hour are required to stop in
310 feet--the length of a football field--once the brakes are
applied.\41\ Actual stopping distances are often much longer due to
driver response time before braking and the common problem that truck
brakes are often not in adequate working condition.

There is overwhelming opposition to any increases to truck size and
weight limits. The public, local government officials, safety, consumer
and public health groups, law enforcement, first responders, truck
drivers and labor representatives, families of truck crash victims and
survivors, and even Congress on a bipartisan level have all rejected
attempts to increase truck size and weight. Also, the technical reports
released in June 2015 from the U.S. DOT Comprehensive Truck Size and
Weight Study concluded there is a ``profound'' lack of data from which
to quantify the safety impact of larger or heavier trucks and
consequently recommended that no changes in the relevant truck size and
weight laws and regulations be considered until data limitations are
overcome.\42\

Considering Congress recently enacted, and this week President
Biden signed into law, the IIJA which invests billions of dollars to
improve and make safer our nation's roads and bridges, any increase to
federal truck size and weight limits will undermine this objective,
worsen safety problems, and divert rail traffic from privately owned
freight railroads to our already overburdened public highways. Despite
claims to the contrary, bigger trucks will not result in fewer trucks.
Following every past increase to federal truck size and weight limits,
the number of trucks on our roads has gone up. Since 1982, when
Congress last increased the gross vehicle weight limit, truck
registrations have more than doubled.\43\ The U.S. DOT study also
addressed this meritless assertion and found that any potential mileage
efficiencies from the use of heavier trucks would be offset in just one
year.\44\ Congress should oppose any increases to federal truck size
and weight limits, including mandating double 33 feet trailers, pilot
programs and state or industry specific exemptions.

While autonomous technology could offer the promise of
significantly reducing crashes involving CMVs in the future, it is far
from ready to be deployed safely on our nation's roads and therefore is
not a viable option to address America's supply chain issues. The
advent of this technology must not be used as a pretext to eviscerate
essential safety regulations administered by the FMCSA. The public
safety protections provided by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Regulations (FMCSRs) become no less important or applicable simply
because a CMV has been equipped with an autonomous driving system
(ADS). In fact, additional substantial public safety concerns are
presented by autonomous commercial motor vehicles (ACMVs).
Autonomous technology is still in its relative infancy as evidenced
by fatal and serious crashes involving passenger motor vehicles
equipped with automated driving systems of varying levels. If those
incidents had involved ACMVs, the results could have been even more
catastrophic, and the death and injury toll could have been much worse.
Some of the most pressing safety shortcomings associated with
autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, which include the ADS properly
detecting and reacting to all other road users, driver engagement and
cybersecurity, are exponentially amplified by the greater mass and
force of an ACMV. As such, it is imperative that ACMVs be subject to
comprehensive regulations, including having a licensed driver behind
the wheel for the foreseeable future.
Advocates and numerous stakeholders have developed the ``AV
Tenets,'' policy positions which should be a foundational part of any
AV legislation.\45\ The AV Tenets have four main, commonsense
categories including: 1) prioritizing safety of all road users; 2)
guaranteeing accessibility and equity; 3) preserving consumer and
worker rights; and, 4) ensuring local control and sustainable
transportation. While the AV Tenets were developed for application to
vehicles under 10,000 pounds, many of the principles also could apply
to larger commercial vehicles. Requiring that ACMVs meet safety
standards, including for cybersecurity, and that operations are subject
to adequate oversight must be a minimum starting point for their
potential deployment.

Conclusion
Truck crashes continue to occur at an astonishingly high rate. The
complex issues facing our nation's supply chain will not be solved by
advancing reckless proposals that imperil truck drivers and the public
and damage America's aging infrastructure. Furthermore, risky driving
behavior such as speeding, impairment, and lack of seat belt use are
up, according to recent U.S. DOT projections, leading to more deadly
conditions for everyone on and around roads. Yet, the unending assault
on essential federal regulations that protect public safety continues.
Drastically cutting back truck safety protections under the guise of
providing ``flexibility'' will result in preventable fatalities.
Instead, we urge this Committee to advance policies and proven
solutions that will improve safety and working conditions to curb the
high rates of driver turnover. Nearly 5,000 people killed and 150,000
injured in truck crashes annually cannot continue to be accepted as a
societal norm or a cost of moving goods on our nation's roads.
Sincerely,
Catherine Chase,
President, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety.

Statement of Chuck Baker, President, American Short Line and Regional
Railroad Association, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Peter A. DeFazio
Introduction
As president of the American Short Line and Regional Railroad
Association (ASLRRA), the trade association representing the nation's
600 Class II and III railroads, I submit this testimony for inclusion
in the record of this committee's hearing.
We appreciate the committee's focus on supply chain challenges
confronting the country and our North American neighbors. ASLRRA's
short line freight railroad members operate 24/7/365 in this ever-
changing and complex, increasingly demanding economic environment.
Throughout the pandemic--and just as we did before the pandemic--our
members have provided service to customers from coast to coast,
ensuring that businesses in small towns and rural communities that
might otherwise be cut off from the freight rail network have the
access they need to the global supply chain. As challenges to the
economy have mounted, our members have acted as critical ``shock
absorbers'' for the freight network, blunting the impact of supply
chain headaches through our flexible, friendly, and customized service.
We are proud of the service our members provide, especially during
these times, and we are eager to share our insight, perspective and
suggestions with this panel.
The country's short line freight rail industry is a vital part of North
American's supply chain
ASLRRA's members are class II and class III railroads, all of which
are classified as small businesses.\1\ Our members are critical links
in the nation's freight supply chain and all are vital engines of
economic activity. Together, our members are tied to 478,000 jobs
nationwide, $26.1 billion in labor income and $56.2 billion in economic
value-add--providing a service that 10,000 businesses nationwide rely
upon to get goods and products to market.\2\ Our members are also
environmental stewards, providing a sustainable, low-carbon logistics
option that is more environmentally friendly than competing forms of
surface transportation. Freight railroads are an incredibly green way
to move goods. Railroads account for only 0.5 percent of total U.S.
greenhouse gas emissions, according to EPA data, and just 1.9 percent
of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions. On average, U.S.
freight railroads move one ton of freight 480 miles on a single gallon
of diesel fuel. Altogether, short line service keeps 31.8 million heavy
trucks off highways and public roads, preventing costly wear and tear,
relieving congestion, and reducing the number of deadly crashes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ According to the Surface Transportation Board, a Class II
railroad has annual revenues between $40,400,000 and $900,000,000; a
Class III railroad has revenues below $40,400,000.
\2\ The Section 45G Tax Credit and the Economic Contribution of the
Short Line Railroad Industry, prepared by PWC for ASLRRA (2018).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short line railroads are especially integral in providing first-
and last-mile service, functioning frequently as the first and/or often
final link between suppliers and customers who require critical goods
and freight. Our members provide this connection in many key industries
critical to our country's economic health, including the manufacturing,
agricultural, mining and chemical sectors.
Avoid any effort to increase the size and weight of trucks
ASLRRA cautions against any action by USDOT or other policymakers
that could lead to an increase in truck size and weights. Bigger and
longer trucks will divert more freight to our roadways and lead to
greater wear and tear on already worn-out roads, worse roadway
congestion, more air pollution and truck GHG emissions, and a litany of
dangerous conditions affecting all roadway users. One train can take
hundreds of truckloads off our nation's highways. Supply chain
disruption should not be an excuse to allow more dangerous and unstable
trucks on our roads. Moreover, some types of configurations of bigger
trucks--like twin 33s--actually exacerbate supply chain bottlenecks,
introducing greater inefficiencies to intermodal freight traffic, as
railcars would be able to carry fewer overall trailers--meaning longer
wait times for goods and freight carried by rail.

Avoid any regulatory efforts that further exacerbate supply chain
problems
ASLRRA cautions USDOT and Congress against any efforts that would
make the supply chain problem even worse. USDOT should forego
proceeding with efforts like crew size requirements that could force
our members to make tough economic choices and sacrifice other
activities they are eager to undertake, like hiring more employees for
functions where they actually need more staff or neglecting to make
investments in upgrades and improvements that allow more efficient
movement of goods and freight. Ill-conceived regulatory efforts--
especially those that aren't backed up by safety data--are misguided
and exacerbate problems instead of creating solutions. USDOT
requirements for increased crew size on privately-owned and maintained
freight rail would be unfair, unhelpful for both safety and the supply
chain, and at complete odds with other USDOT efforts to develop and
incentivize driverless trucks (and on publicly-funded infrastructure,
no less).
Likewise, ASLRRA cautions USDOT and Congress against any action
that blocks, stifles or thwarts the advent or use of technology that
promotes safer operational practices and the efficient use of track and
rail infrastructure. Preventing railroads from harnessing the power of
such critical technology could add bottlenecks to our freight network
and impede the movement of important goods and supplies.
Advance important funding opportunities that help short line freight
railroads
Short line railroading is one of the most capital-intensive
industries in the country. Short lines invest on average 25 percent to
33 percent of their annual revenues in maintaining and rehabilitating
their infrastructure. Short lines are also often the custodians of
expensive bridges and tunnels that were originally built by much larger
railroads years earlier and are now reaching the end of their useful
lives. Federal funding opportunities like the Consolidated Rail
Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) grant program provide
short lines with an opportunity to meet these challenges. As the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) is implemented and its
critical resources are made available, we encourage the administration
to prioritize for funding the many freight rail projects that reduce
supply chain bottlenecks. These projects also have enormous
environmental benefits and are often the biggest ``bang for the buck''
available in surface transportation.
Ensuring critical resources are made available through CRISI and
other important USDOT grant efforts (like the Rebuilding American
Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE), Infrastructure
for Rebuilding America (INFRA), and Railroad Crossing Elimination grant
programs, among others) will allow our members to make congestion-
reducing investments in track upgrades, for example upgrades through
CRISI to support industry-standard 286,000-lb railcars, so they can
provide more shipping solutions for customers and bring greater
efficiency to the network.
Conclusion
We appreciate the committee's close attention to our statement, and
we welcome future opportunities to work together on this matter.

Statement of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division of
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Submitted for the Record by
Hon. Peter A. DeFazio
Railroads Want To Risk Safety & Take Track Inspectors off the Tracks
Class I railroads want to eliminate human track inspectors and
replace them with an unproven approach to track inspection--risking
derailments and the safety of railroad workers and the public.
Track inspection professionals have been keeping American railroad
infrastructure safe for over 150 years. The Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA) has rules setting how frequently railroads must
have track inspectors conduct visual track inspections. 49 CFR
Sec. 213.233.
In testimony before the House Transportation & Infrastructure
Committee on November 17, 2021, the President and CEO of the
Association of American Railroads (AAR) whined that the FRA does not
automatically approve waivers of track inspection safety rules that set
the required frequency of human track inspections.
On October 29, 2021, a group of Republican Senators wrote to FRA
Deputy Administrator Amit Bose urging the FRA to rubber-stamp approvals
of these safety waiver requests.
The AAR characterizes the FRA's review of railroad safety waivers
as ``stifling innovation'' and preventing the railroads from
implementing new technology, but this is not true.
There is absolutely nothing in the FRA regulations keeping the
railroads from using track geometry cars to conduct automated track
inspections as frequently as the railroads would like. On Amtrak's
class 6-8 tracks, track geometry cars are already used at the same
frequencies the railroads want without FRA safety waivers. But Amtrak
is adhering to the existing required schedule for human track
inspections.
The waivers of FRA safety rules being sought after by the railroads
would take human track inspectors off the tracks while the railroads
replace them with new machines that are first being tested and only
check a portion of the safety factors inspected by a human inspector.
What we currently know is that automated track inspections cannot
find all defects required by FRA rules. Track geometry defects make up
approximately 25 percent of the total defects inspected by human track
inspectors. Taking human track inspectors off the tracks leaves 75
percent of track defects unmonitored and puts us all at risk.
Additionally, human track inspectors must make ``immediate
remediation'' of the deficiencies they find. The machines cannot do
that.
Rail labor supports the expanded use of these track geometry cars
to assist experienced human track inspection professionals. Still, the
waivers submitted to FRA indicate that the railroads want to cut human
track inspections by up to 80 percent below current levels while
sorting out whether the new technology works for the defects it does
check, even though there are defects these machines are unable to
detect. The AAR's assertion that the FRA or rail labor prevents more
significant deployment of these machines is false.
Railroads can add all the new technology they want without FRA
safety waivers. Railroads put lives at risk by taking human track
inspectors off the track while testing new machines that are not even
designed to evaluate all the defects assessed by inspectors.

Re: Public Comments for November 17, 2021 Full Committee Hearing On:
``Industry and Labor Perspectives: A Further Look at North American
Supply Chain Challenges''

Dear Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and Members of the
Committee:
On behalf of the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy (LAANE), I
appreciate the opportunity to submit these comments and recommendations
for consideration in today's House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee hearing on supply chain challenges. LAANE is a non-profit
organization dedicated to helping build a new economy rooted in good
jobs, thriving communities, and a healthy environment. Over the past 15
years, we have worked in coalition with labor and community partners to
transform the port trucking industry to become more sustainable and
equitable. As we outline below, the root cause of the poverty and
pollution we have been tackling at the ports is also at the root of the
current supply chain bottleneck: an industry-wide, unlawful model of
driver misclassification. Our path out of this crisis must begin with
ending this illegal practice and bringing the port trucking industry
into compliance to ensure an efficient and functional system of port
operations.
I. Background: The port drayage industry's systemic misclassification
of drivers is at the root of the supply chain crisis
The Ports of LA and Long Beach are pivotal to global trade and the
United States economy. Known together as the San Pedro Bay Ports, they
are by far the largest port complex in the US, handling about 40% of
all containerized cargo coming into the United States. The goods that
comes through the San Pedro Bay Ports reach every Congressional
district in the nation.
The significance of these ports is not just due to the capacity of
the port terminals themselves, but also to the vast goods movement
infrastructure in Southern California. The ports are a key engine of
the regional economy, with one in nine jobs in Los Angeles County
connected to the San Pedro Bay Port Complex.\1\ Indeed, recent coverage
of the current global logjam has reported on how difficult it has been
for shippers to divert cargo to other ports because they fall short in
trucking, rail, and warehousing capacity.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Misclassification: An unlawful and inefficient model creating a
chokepoint
While the current goods movement crisis is fueled by compounding
failures all along the supply chain, it is being exacerbated by an
inefficient and fractured port drayage system. The rampant and unlawful
misclassification at the ports has created an unaccountable,
exploitative, and fragmented structure that hinders industry-wide
efforts to create an efficient, predictable, and rational system at the
ports.
The vast majority of the workforce of over 12,000 drivers at the
San Pedro Bay Ports are Latino men, the majority of whom are
immigrants.\3\ While they were lauded as essential workers during the
pandemic, the industry has treated them as expendable, denying them
critical protections and their basic rights as employees by
misclassifying them as ``independent contractors.'' Perversely, the
majority of companies at the ports continue to unlawfully misclassify
their drivers and pretend they are somehow each independent businesses
rather than employees, when the legal system has overwhelmingly found
that port drivers are in fact employees and therefore are due rights as
such.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ Port of Los Angeles, 2021 Port Truck Driver Survey, Pg.3,
August 29, 2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the past decade, every federal and state government agency and
court that has investigated port trucking companies has repeatedly and
resoundingly found port truck drivers were not true independent
contractors, but rather employees--from the US Department of Labor, to
the National Labor Relations Board, to state and federal district and
appeals courts, to almost 500 decisions from the California Labor
Commissioner's Office alone. Yet notwithstanding these uniform
findings, the vast majority of port trucking companies continue to
violate the law with impunity, denying their drivers basic employee
rights, including wage and hour protections such as minimum wage and
paid sick leave; unemployment, disability, and workers compensation
insurance; occupational health and safety protections; and the right to
organize a union with their coworkers. Major logistics corporations XPO
and Universal Logistics own port trucking subsidiaries that have
received multiple final court judgments for misclassification and wage
theft, yet continue to operate outside of the law.
Any appearance of a ``driver shortage'' is really a shortage of
good jobs. Misclassification in port trucking has been extensively
documented as modern-day indentured servitude,\4\ and the industry is
notorious for unlawfully forcing drivers to shoulder truck costs and to
work long hours without meal and rest breaks and other basic employee
protections, including Covid protections. Further, by misclassifying
drivers and paying them by the load, trucking companies get away with
offloading the costs of long wait times and traffic congestion onto
drivers' backs, eliminating any incentive for trucking companies or
cargo owners to push for a more efficient system.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ USA Today, Rigged--Forced into debt, Worked past exhaustion.
Left with nothing, Brett Murphy, June 16, 2017
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to having a devastating impact on drivers and their
families, the industry's misclassification of drivers has negative
effects all along the supply chain and beyond, outlined as follows:

The current misclassification-based drayage system is
chaotic and unpredictable. In testimony delivered to the California
Joint Assembly and Senate Ports and Good Movement Select Committee
hearing on November 3, 2021, Port of Los Angeles Executive Director
Gene Seroka reported that 30% of all truck appointments at the port
terminals go unfilled, a figure that goes up to 50% on the weekends.
With a more rational system based on an employee workforce, employers
could coordinate driver schedules and provide direction to employees to
ensure that appointments are met, and could provide backup labor if
drivers are stuck in lines beyond their control and unable to make
appointments. An employee-based model would also ensure that drivers
receive fair compensation, including hourly pay for all hours waiting
in line to pick up a container, a night differential for working the
night shift, and overtime wages.
The lack of accountability in the port drayage sector has also
led to a highly fragmented market, with over 1,200 trucking companies
registered to do business at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach,
of which 800 are in active service.\5\ This is grossly inefficient,
given that just 50 of those companies move about half of all
containers. A more manageable universe of companies would further
contribute to a more rational system of drayage where appointment
systems can work, which would in turn lead to a much more rational
system of terminal operation itself.

By misclassifying drivers, the industry also hurts the
public because companies that misclassify are not paying or deducting
payroll taxes, depriving Social Security and state unemployment and
disability insurance funds of sorely needed contributions. A recent
analysis by the California Department of Labor Standards Enforcement
found that misclassification costs the state of California $7 billion
annually.\6\ An earlier study by the Government Accounting Office found
that the Federal government is shortchanged by at least $2.6 billion
annually by companies that misclassify their workers.\7\

Companies that operate outside of the law by
misclassifying are also undercutting law-abiding businesses, creating
unfair competition for companies that do pay their taxes and follow
labor and employment laws. Trucking companies that misclassify their
drivers undercut compliant operators by at least 30%, profit margins in
the industry are narrow, at about 8%. So while misclassification is
illegal, as a port trucking company owner testified in a 2018 hearing
at the Port of Long Beach, this model persists because ``It is cheaper
to cheat.'' \8\

The ``driver shortage'' is really a shortage of decent work
Rather than seek to address the glaring dysfunction in the port
trucking industry--an illegal business model--the industry has instead
chosen to dust off its perennial claims of a driver shortage. Here we
take a closer look at key indicators of driver retention and supply,
which again point to a fundamental issue with the industry, not the
number of drivers available to work. A 2019 Bureau of Labor Statistics
report examining the industry's claim of a driver shortage found a 94%
\9\ turnover rate in large Truckload Carriers and nearly 80% in smaller
Truckload Carriers, using data collected by the American Trucking
Association. Such astronomically high turnover rates point to a problem
with working conditions. Indeed, other segments of the trucking sector
which have higher unionization rates had much lower turnover rate of
11.7%,\10\ pointing to the value of job quality in retaining drivers in
the industry.

labor market for truck drivers broken?, March 2019, Stephen V. Burks &

\10\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Focusing in on California, the epicenter of the current backlogs,
the trucking industry's claims of a dire shortage of truck drivers do
not hold up under further examination of data. According to a recent
article by Time magazine there are over 640,000 California residents
with Class A & B Commercial Drivers Licenses (CDLs), but there are only
140,000 truck transportation jobs in California.\11\ Shifting focus to
port drayage drivers in the San Pedro Bay Ports, data compiled for the
Clean Truck Program clearly show an excess of registered trucks
eligible to call upon the ports (the closest proxy for port drivers in
publicly available data). In the most recently released data, the ports
report there are 19,878 \12\ trucks with access to port terminals in
the Port of Long Beach and 18,374 \13\ with access to the Port of Los
Angeles. Of those, there are 14,727 and 13,352 active trucks--those
that make at least one trip to port terminals a month--at the Port of
Long Beach and Los Angeles respectively.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
With over four times as many licensed truck drivers in the state
than available trucking jobs, and with a surplus of at least 25% of
trucks with access to port terminals that are not calling on the ports,
it is clear that there is no real shortage of drivers available to move
goods. Again, the shortage is one of decent, dignified working
conditions, combined with a lack of a rational, efficient system in
which drivers can perform their jobs.
The trucking industry's push to lower the CDL age as one of the
solutions to the current cargo problem, will not help move any
containers before the holidays and may actually make the situation
worse. The recent infrastructure bill signed by President Biden
includes millions for new truck driver training and there are already
countless driver training programs in existence. But as shown above the
number of people with CDLs does not mean there will be a job to place
them in. This conclusion that the problem is not a lack of drivers
willing to do the job, but rather an inefficient system, has been
echoed in many recent reports, from a union driver,\14\ to a non-union
trucking company owner in Oakland.\15\ Flooding the market with new,
inexperienced drivers will only add to port congestion.

II. The Solution: Rationalize port drayage by ending systemic
misclassification of port drivers
The port drayage system as it operates today is not a rational nor
an efficient system, as has been clearly demonstrated over the past
several months. In a recent Port of Los Angeles Harbor Commission
meeting, Commissioner Diane Middleton recently offered the following
analysis of the causes of the congestion plaguing the ports and what
it's going to take to end the chaos:

``When we look at the two other critical parts of the supply
chain, truckers and warehouse workers, there is a tremendous
breakdown there. Everyone understands it. The legislature did
their job in trying to pass laws that protect warehouse workers
and truckers. I believe this situation is never going to change
until these workers are unionized, and they have someone who
can collectively bargain around wages, hours and working
conditions. It will bring what I call, rationalization, to the
system.'' \16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Container Excess Dwell Fee,'' Port of Los Angeles Board of Harbor
Commissioners, October 29, 2021, video, 41:05, https://
www.portoflosangeles.org/commission/agenda-archive-and-videos

To rationalize this system, we must first rein in misclassification
with all the policy tools at our disposal, starting with vigorous
enforcement. In the absence of accountability, good high-road trucking
companies who properly classify their drivers as employees have no
incentive to do business in the ports of LA and Long Beach as they can
be so easily undercut by those that operate outside the law and make
money off the backs of workers, taxpayers and law-abiding companies.
While trucking companies must be held accountable and come into
compliance with federal, state, and local labor, employment, and tax
laws, there will always be a race to the bottom as long as there are
low-road companies that can undercut those who follow the law. To raise
the floor and transform the industry, the powerful players at the top
of the supply chain--the Beneficial Cargo Owners--must also be held
accountable for the abuses in their supply chains. The real economic
employers that benefit from this whole system are the retailers and
brands who contract with trucking companies and they have the resources
and the power to dictate the terms of those contracts.
III. Recommended policy actions
Below, we outline key actions that Congress, the Biden
Administration, and key agencies can take to alleviate the congestion
at the ports, namely promoting good jobs and preventing further system
failures by ending the illegal business model which relies on
misclassification and exploitation

Congress and the President must take immediate measures
during this crisis, through full use of Congressional action and
Executive Orders, to create a more rational, efficient, and accountable
port drayage system, including by:

Securing land to store containers and incentivizing the
use of unionized companies or companies with labor peace agreements to
expedite the clearing of backlogged containers without labor
disruptions or strikes impeding this critical work.

Addressing the race to the bottom in trucking spurred
by so-called deregulation and legislation like the FAAAA. Trucking
companies have perverted the intent behind these laws and have
advocated for broad preemptive powers which prevent states and
localities from addressing critical labor and employment issues.
Stymying the ability of local and state governments to raise standards
to create a more efficient and accountable system at the ports has led
to the systemic misclassification driving the current crisis.

Incentivizing Beneficial Cargo Owners to only use
companies that properly classify their port drivers as employees, that
require decent labor standards--including living wages and good health
insurance--and that require labor peace agreements from their
contractors to avoid labor unrest throughout their supply chains.

Ensuring that federal contracts can address the current
crisis and do not finance or enrich law-breaking companies by requiring
that any recipients or contractors only use law-abiding port trucking
companies that properly classify drivers as employees and that have
union contracts or other labor peace agreements which will prevent
labor unrest throughout their supply chains at this critical time.

The DOL, the IRS, other key agencies, and even state
governments can develop a program to audit port trucking companies,
requiring immediate reclassification or cessation of operations by all
trucking companies it finds to be engaging in misclassification, and
recovering unpaid FICA and payroll taxes.

Call upon Beneficial Cargo Owners--retailers and brands--
to develop and enforce a Code of Conduct that demands strict compliance
with state and federal law, that prohibits misclassification, that
requires decent labor standards, including living wages and good health
insurance, and that requires labor peace agreements or union contracts
to avoid labor unrest throughout their supply chains.

Vigorously support organizing rights and the PRO Act to
remove barriers for drivers who are striving to exercise their employee
rights and improve their working conditions.

Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Jessica Durrum,
Ports Project Director, Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy.

Letter of December 1, 2021, to Hon. Peter A. DeFazio, Chair and Hon.
Sam Graves, Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure, from Robyn M. Boerstling, Vice President,
Infrastructure, Innovation, and Human Resources Policy, National
Association of Manufacturers, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Sam
Graves
December 1, 2021.
Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,
Chairman,
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, U.S. House of
Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
Hon. Sam Graves,
Ranking Member,
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, U.S. House of
Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves,
The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the largest
manufacturing association in the United States representing
manufacturers in every industrial sector and in all 50 states,
appreciates the Committee's focus on addressing national supply chain
shortcomings by holding the recent hearing entitled, ``Industry and
Labor Perspectives: A Further Look at North American Supply Chain
Challenges''.
NAM membership is comprised of businesses operating in all areas of
the national supply chain, utilizing all modes of shipping
transportation, and duly affected by any challenges that arise,
especially those causing systematic impacts. Throughout the COVID-19
pandemic manufacturers have risen to the challenge of safely operating
industrial facilities to meet the needs of America's consumers and
communities and fulfilling varied essential services. As the strain on
our nation's supply chain persists across multimodal operations and
across industries, NAM members have experienced firsthand the real-time
impacts of cost increases and time delays. Manufacturers in the United
States possess a unique perspective on all surface, water and air-based
goods shipments and support appropriate federal actions and policies
aimed at lessening existing constraints and preventing further supply
chain disruptions.
For many years, the NAM has strongly advocated for increased
federal investment into the nation's infrastructure. In order to
maintain global competitiveness, our roads, bridges, waterways,
airports and related systems must be built and maintained for the
century ahead. No global economic power can compete on the world stage
if products cannot efficiently be moved to market and transported to
and from international launch points. The recently enacted
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will provide historic funding
for American infrastructure and create economic growth opportunity
without implementing new undue tax burdens on the manufacturing base
that is our national economic engine. With a combination of opportunity
for private investment and direct injection of federal funding into
vital and long-overdue projects, this initiative will build the
infrastructure our nation desperately needs to achieve historic
economic prosperity, create sustainable and resilient national systems,
and ensure long-term growth for American industry. Additionally, by
securing long-term solvency for our nation's surface transportation
systems, businesses that rely heavily on the trains, trucks and other
forms of surface shipping would gain the secure outlook needed for
advanced planning and strategic growth.
As the administration develops new programs to utilize this
funding, the NAM strongly encourages continued engagement with
congressional partners and the industrial partners who will build,
repair and maintain the national infrastructure systems highlighted in
the law. Specifically, as both short- and long-term port and supply
chain remedies are considered, pursuing projects that allow local ports
and terminal operators appropriate flexibility in meeting local demands
should be a paramount focus. Technological upgrades for shipping data
management and logistical operations for onsite container and truck
movements at America's ports should also be considered an effective use
of IIJA port funding. Further, truck congestion on the surface side
operations of ports could be alleviated if additional trailer and
container parking and storage were available at or nearby existing port
locations. IIJA funding can make a targeted impact on trucking
congestion at ports if applied towards the creation or expansion of
additional parking facilities and physical space for intermodal
transfer and container storage use.
The most visible inflection point for current supply chain
constraints has been at American ports. As the U.S. economy began to
rebound from COVID-19, it quickly became apparent that our existing
supply chain was not impervious to global facility shutdowns, worker
shortages and other ancillary impacts resulting from a once-in-a-
century pandemic. The nation's manufacturing and industrial base now
faces historically higher shipping costs, unpredictable delivery delays
for essential components and heretofore unseen limitations on cargo
space availability for ocean going freight. The NAM would further
encourage congressional efforts to enact programs that incentivize,
train and license heavy-duty commercial vehicle drivers. Current
federal law prohibits the interstate movement of goods by commercial
driver's license (CDL) holders under the age of 21. Along with
additional industry advocates, the NAM has called for passage of the
DRIVE Safe Act, which would authorize appropriate federal approval for
training and apprenticeship programs to allow for the legal operation
of commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce by under-21 CDL
holders. By activating this existing pool of trained and licensed
drivers, the federal government could quickly alleviate some of the
systematic burden caused by a nationwide truck driver shortage.
An additional step available to enhance operations at the Port of
LA and other heavy volume domestic ocean ports includes wider
introduction of innovative data logistics management systems. The
digitization of industrial processes has led to advanced manufacturing
procedures that enhance competitive productivity. As Congress and the
administration review opportunities for federal investment to
reinvigorate port operations, advanced data management has the
potential to utilize innovative logistics to identify bottlenecks,
streamline container and chassis delivery and transition antiquated
infrastructure for a modern shipping landscape.
The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), which is tasked with
jurisdictional oversight of operations and operators at American ports,
also has a slate of proactive options that could be exercised to ease
shipping burdens for the industrial sector. While existing authorities
would allow the assessment of fees on international ocean carriers
operating practices that adversely affect the U.S., the threat of
action has historically brought disparate parties to a consensus on
fairly adjudicating disputes. NAM members are frustrated with empty
shipping containers taking up usable cargo space on ocean-bound
outgoing ships, often times in place of contracted container space for
U.S. produced goods. While this practice may financially benefit the
carriers' bottom line, it disadvantages key sectors of the U.S.
economy. The NAM would encourage the FMC to utilize any necessary and
appropriate levies or authorized abilities to ensure operators and
carriers at U.S. ports do not unfairly select cargo loads that run
counter to contractual obligations or domestic interests. Should
congressional action be necessary to empower the FMC with more specific
instructions, we would encourage consideration of such efforts on
behalf of manufacturers in the U.S.
The current status of the domestic supply chain presents daunting
challenges and threatens the continued economic revival of
manufacturers in the United States who have successfully responded to
the COVID-19 pandemic. Manufacturers know the immense capabilities of
American ingenuity and the recommendations included here are few of the
many steps that the NAM hopes congressional leaders will consider to
ease cost burdens, reduce shipping timetables and allocate resources
for more efficient industrial goods transportation. The NAM has
recently enlisted members to participate in a Ports and Ocean Shipping
Task Force, dedicated to productive engagement with policymakers and to
serve as a forum for industrial best practices and anecdotal dialogue.
We invite Members from the Committee to join the Task Force for an
upcoming meeting and look forward to continuing a solutions-oriented
conversation to rectify national supply chain challenges.
Sincerely,
Robyn M. Boerstling,
Vice President, Infrastructure, Innovation, and Human Resources
Policy,
National Association of Manufacturers.

Letter of September 13, 2021, to Hon. John Garamendi and Hon. Dusty
Johnson from Accustom Brokerage, LLC et al., Submitted for the Record
by Hon. John Garamendi
September 13, 2021.
The Honorable John Garamendi,
U.S. House of Representatives,
2368 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Dusty Johnson,
U.S. House of Representatives,
1714 Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Representatives Garamendi and Johnson,
On behalf of the undersigned companies and trade associations
representing U.S. importers, exporters, transportation providers and
other supply chain stakeholders, we are writing to express our strong
support for the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2021 (OSRA21) (HR 4996)
which you have introduced. We believe the reforms included in OSRA21
will help address longstanding, systemic supply chain and port
disruption issues which have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19
pandemic.
The ongoing supply chain challenges that face the nation's
exporters and importers are having a significant effect on their
economic recovery during the pandemic. While the supply chain has been
stretched from end-to-end, there are systemic issues that need to be
addressed in the maritime cargo sphere. For many years, the issue of
detention and demurrage has been a problem leading to significant cost
increases for cargo owners and truckers, many times due to issues
beyond their control. We certainly welcomed the Interpretive Rule on
Detention and Demurrage as published by the Federal Maritime
Commission, but we need more than just ``guidance'' that is not being
followed by ocean carriers nor marine terminals, leading to hundreds of
millions of dollars in unfair penalties against US shippers and their
transportation partners. The legislation will seek to formalize this
rule and truly define the parameters for these charges.
Foreign markets are critical to American businesses, particularly
US farmers and ranchers, with more than 20% of agricultural production
going abroad. Problems obtaining ocean containers of any kind combined
with difficulty securing vessel space at fair and reasonable prices,
are jeopardizing livelihoods and economic recovery. The attention given
these unreasonable practices and the reforms proposed in OSRA21 are
critical to reversing those challenges facing not only US exporters but
also US businesses that rely on imports.
The legislation will also seek to update key provisions of the
Ocean Shipping Reform Act, which hasn't been updated in over two
decades. The maritime transportation system has changed significantly
during those decades. While some maritime transportation system changes
have been a positive for the industry overall, we need to ensure the
regulations remain applicable to today's reality. With the creation of
the carrier alliances, contraction of the number of carriers in the
market, changes to chassis management and others, we believe the time
is right for these important reforms.
We thank you for your strong leadership on this issue to ensure
that the ongoing supply chain disruption and port congestion issues are
addressed. This will help ensure U.S. competitiveness and continued
economic recovery. We look forward to working with you to ensure
passage of this important legislation.

Letter of August 9, 2021, to Hon. John Garamendi and Hon. Dusty Johnson
from the Agriculture Transportation Coalition et al., Submitted for the
Record by Hon. John Garamendi
August 9, 2021.
Representative John Garamendi,
Representative Dusty Johnson,
U.S. House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
Dear Congressmen Garamendi and Johnson;
The US agriculture and forest products industry strongly endorses
your legislation, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2021 ``OSRA21''. The
undersigned companies and associations believe the Act's provisions
addressing unreasonable detention and demurrage charges, export cargo
bookings, and other carrier practices, are essential to allow US
agriculture to remain competitive in global markets.
The transportation crisis for US agriculture and forest products is
becoming increasingly dire each month. There is nothing we produce in
agriculture and forest products in this country, that cannot be sourced
in some other country. If we cannot deliver, affordably and dependably,
our foreign customers will find alternatives to our exports. Our survey
suggests that on average 22% of US agriculture foreign sales cannot be
completed due to ocean carrier rates, declining to carry export cargo,
unreasonable demurrage and detention charges, and other practices.
Over 150 Members of Congress have written urging prompt Federal
initiative. The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
hearing, President Biden's Executive Order 14036, and Secretary of US
Department of Transportation Buttigieg's recent port Roundtable all
confirm that current law and regulation are insufficient to protect the
ocean shipping interests of US exporters and importers.
We strongly support provisions in your bill to gain reasonable and
fair ocean carrier practices consistent with the Federal Maritime
Commission's excellent Interpretive Rule on Demurrage and Detention--
which unfortunately has gone unheeded for over two years. It imposes
upon carriers the obligation to self-police compliance with that Rule.
In addition, the bill obligates ocean carriers to carry export cargo,
to the extent they can do so safely. It addresses carrier practices
limiting efficient use of containers, chassis and other equipment.
We greatly appreciate your engagement with the agriculture
community nationwide, to develop this proposed Act. As it proceeds
through the legislative process, we look forward to working with you to
advance and strengthen the bill.

The Honorable Dusty Johnson,
U.S. House of Representatives,
1714 Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Representatives Garamendi and Johnson,
The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) is writing
to express our support for the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2021
(OSRA21), which you have introduced. We believe the reforms included in
OSRA21 will help address serious and significant supply chain and port
disruption issues.
AHAM represents manufacturers of major, portable and floor care
home appliances, and suppliers to the industry. AHAM's membership
includes over 150 companies throughout the world. In the U.S., AHAM
members support more than one million jobs, have a $198 billion
economic impact, and produce more than 95% of the household appliances
shipped for sale. The home appliance industry, through its products and
innovation, is essential to consumer lifestyle, health, safety and
convenience. Home appliances also are a success story in terms of
energy efficiency and environmental protection. The purchase of new
appliances often represents the most effective choice a consumer can
make to reduce home energy use and costs.
OSRA21 would update key provisions of the Ocean Shipping Reform
Act, which has not been updated in over two decades. The maritime
transportation system has changed significantly during those decades
and with the creation of the carrier alliances, we believe the time is
right for these important legislative reforms.
We thank you for your leadership on this issue to help address the
supply chain disruption and port congestion problems.
Sincerely,
Jacob Cassady,
Director, Government Relations, Association of Home Appliance
Manufacturers.

Letter of November 17, 2021, to Hon. Peter DeFazio, Chair and Hon. Sam
Graves, Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
from Gary Shapiro, President and CEO, Consumer Technology Association,
Submitted for the Record by Hon. John Garamendi
November 17, 2021.
The Honorable Peter DeFazio,
Chairman,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of
Representatives, 2134 Rayburn House Office Building,
Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Sam Graves,
Ranking Member,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of
Representatives, 1135 Longworth House Office Building,
Washington, DC 20515.
Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves,
As our nation's largest technology trade association, the Consumer
Technology Association (CTA)  agrees we need robust and resilient
supply chains to protect consumers and ensure American innovation,
economic success and global competitiveness.
CTA has supported ongoing efforts across the federal government to
address supply chain challenges facing the U.S., including President
Biden's comprehensive approach to reviewing the U.S. supply chain
initiated earlier this year.
CTA has also published its own studies and analyses to help
policymakers and industry stakeholders understand how companies and
consumers rely on global supply chains and what can be done to solve
these problems.\1\ While the causes of the current supply chain crises
are multiple and complex, Congress can take three actions now to
alleviate the strain on American businesses and consumers:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ https://shop.cta.tech/collections/research/products/coping-
with-crisis-sme-supply-chain-issues-in-the-pandemic-era
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, pass the bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2021 (H.R.
4996). While American manufacturers, distributors and retailers work
nonstop to rebound from the pandemic and ensure the availability of
goods for their customers at reasonable prices, the global shipping
industry has been taking advantage of these efforts by exploiting
supply chain challenges for a profit. As documented by 60 Minutes
Sunday, shippers have raised prices for global shipping and exploited
port delays by imposing exorbitant fees for time that containers spend
waiting to be unloaded, even when those containers cannot yet access
the port. This has left American businesses, workers and consumers to
suffer through higher costs for goods.
As detailed in this week's New York Times front-page story,
shippers have been refusing to load containers with U.S. agricultural
goods and other products, preferring to quickly return across the ocean
for the more lucrative Asia-U.S. route. As a result, more than 80% of
the 434,000 containers exported out of the port of Los Angeles in
September were empty.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/14/business/economy/farm-
exports-supply-chain-ports.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2021 would reduce the
shipping industry from imposing these exploitative penalties. The bill
would also require shippers to act in the public interest and make it
more difficult for them to refuse cargo from American exporters. This
is the time to pass the Ocean Shipping Reform Act and end shipper
misbehavior.
Second, suspend or eliminate outright the ocean shippers' antitrust
exemption. The ocean shipping industry has consolidated significantly
over the past 20 years, with the ten largest carriers--all of which are
foreign-owned--controlling more than 80 percent of the market.\3\ This
tiny but powerful group has seized on the crisis as a chance to
significantly raise prices for global shipping: a container that pre-
pandemic cost $2,500 to ship currently costs $25,000 or more.\4\ As
American consumers and businesses struggle, foreign shippers are
posting record profits.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/
2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-

\5\ https://qz.com/2060904/ports-are-a-mess-but-shipping-company-
profits-are-at-record-highs/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite these abuses, U.S. regulators, businesses and consumers are
largely powerless because the shipping industry enjoys the U.S.'s
oldest surviving statutory antitrust exemption. This exemption dates to
1916, and the U.S. Department of Justice has consistently called for
its elimination over the past 20 years.\6\ Ocean carriers have taken
advantage of their antitrust exemption and the COVID-19 pandemic by
charging exorbitant fees that are passed on to millions of Americans.
This is an absurd injustice benefitting non-U.S. carriers and hurting
the American public. Ending this anachronistic antitrust exemption is
an obvious and pro-consumer solution.

competition_enforcement_and_regulatory_alternatives_us_
submission.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Third, prioritize sensible automation of American ports. Our port
speed and efficiency lags our international competitors. Not a single
American port is listed in this year's top 50 Container Port
Performance Index. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach were among
the most inefficient in the world, ranking 328 and 333 respectively.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ https://timesofsandiego.com/business/2021/10/20/study-finds-
ports-of-los-angeles-and-long-beach-among-the-worlds-least-efficient/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
One big reason for this inefficiency is that unlike other global
ports, U.S. ports have generally refrained from using new automation
technology, including cranes, container routing and materials handling
innovations. A McKinsey & Co. study found that automating ports could
boost productivity by up to 35%.\8\ While some oppose automation for
fear of its impact on labor, implementation of modern technologies
could be paired with effective initiatives assisting maritime
professionals in the transition to specialized positions requiring
high-level mechanical and logistical skills.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-
infrastructure/our-insights/the-future-of-automated-ports
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our port backlog is not an aberration, it is a warning sign.
Demands on U.S. ports will continue to increase: by 2040, container
traffic at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach could reach 41.1
million 20-foot equivalent units, up from 17.3 million units last
year.\9\ Without a commitment to automation technologies, our present
port disruptions will only persist and worsen--leaving America to fall
further behind our international competitors.

The supply chain crisis is a serious threat to America's economy
and our global leadership. Avoiding empty store shelves and fighting
price inflation will require Congress to think creatively, take bold
measures and go toe-to-toe with powerful interests. We look forward to
working with this Committee on effective solutions.

Gary Shapiro,
President and CEO, Consumer Technology Association.

Letter of October 4, 2021, to Hon. John Garamendi and Hon. Dusty
Johnson from Steve DeHaan, President and CEO, International Warehouse
Logistics Association, Submitted for the Record by Hon. John Garamendi
October 4, 2021.
The Honorable John Garamendi,
U.S. House of Representatives,
2368 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Dusty Johnson,
U.S. House of Representatives,
1714 Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Representatives Garamendi and Johnson:
On behalf of the International Warehouse Logistics Association
(IWLA), I am writing to thank you for sponsoring H.R.4996, the Ocean
Shipping Reform Act of 2021 (OSRA21). If passed, your legislation would
bring much needed reform to demurrage and detention issues and crack
down on the unfair business practices utilized by some ocean carriers.
Founded in 1891, IWLA is the trade association representing
warehouse-based third-party logistics (3PL) providers across North
America. IWLA's member companies and partners provide a range of
services, including warehousing; fulfillment; reverse logistics;
transportation; freight-forwarding and brokerage services; inventory
and supply chain management; and a broad range of manufacturing and
value-added services. Member companies range in size from 10,000 square
foot single city warehouses to international companies with more than
25 million square feet of warehouse space.
OSRA21 would require ocean carriers to certify that any detention
and demurrage charges comply with federal regulations or face
penalties, to adhere to minimum service standards that meet the public
interest, and to report each calendar quarter on the total import/
export tonnage and twenty-foot equivalent units (loaded/empty) per
vessel that make port in the U.S. to the Federal Maritime Commission
(FMC). The legislation would also shift the burden of proof regarding
the reasonableness of detention and demurrage charges from the invoiced
party to the ocean carrier and prohibit carriers from unreasonably
declining opportunities for U.S. exports as determined by the FMC.
These provisions are necessary to address the significant fines
cargo owners and truckers often incur due to port disruption issues
beyond their control. OSRA21 will increase federal oversight of
maritime shipping at U.S. ports, allowing the FMC to initiate
investigations of ocean carriers' business practices and apply
enforcement measures where appropriate. IWLA welcomes these and other
carrier/cargo reforms introduced by the OSRA21.
We thank you for your attention to these critical supply chain
issues and for sponsoring this important legislation. IWLA stands ready
to assist in advancing OSRA21 in Congress. If you have questions about
IWLA or the positions stated within, please contact Patrick O'Connor,
IWLA's Washington Representative.
Sincerely,
Steve DeHaan,
President and CEO, International Warehouse Logistics Association.

Statement of Eric R. Byer, President and CEO, National Association of
Chemical Distributors, Submitted for the Record by Hon. John Garamendi
Thank you for holding this hearing on the severe supply chain
challenges facing a wide range of industries and consumers across the
United States (U.S.). It is vital that Congress address these ongoing
issues head-on by consulting with the most impacted critical industries
and exploring innovative solutions to alleviate the current supply
chain challenges.
National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) is a trade
association of chemical distributors and their supply-chain partners,
whose member companies process, formulate, blend, re-package,
warehouse, transport, and market chemical products for over 750,000
customers. NACD members supply products that are necessary for water
treatment, food preservation, agricultural processes, pharmaceutical
and vaccine production, as well as products needed to manufacture
firefighting materials, sanitation products, and more.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has deemed the
chemical sector as one of 16 critical infrastructure sectors whose
assets, systems, and networks are considered so vital to the U.S. that
their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on
U.S. security, national economic security, and national public health
or safety. Despite the DHS designation, the supply chain disruptions
this committee is examining today have put immense pressure on chemical
distributors throughout the pandemic.
Currently, chemical products such as glycerin, citric acid, sodium
chlorite, sulfamic acid, among other materials, are struggling to move
through the supply chain quickly enough to meet basic demand. This
situation continues to deteriorate, and it is putting Americans in
jeopardy of having insufficient access to clean water, inadequate
medical supplies, limited food production and preservation
capabilities, and more. As the U.S. continues to deal with the impacts
of the COVID-19 pandemic, security of this supply chain is more
important than ever.
Because many chemical products are no longer made domestically,
NACD members must source these chemicals from overseas manufacturers.
They depend on reliable ocean transportation to bring these materials
into the U.S. and deliver them on time so they can supply their
customers who require these critical ingredients for vital functions.
Recently, NACD members have faced severe delays, skyrocketing costs,
and outright order rejections from ocean shipping carriers.
Specifically, regarding instances of carriers' refusal to ship certain
products, NACD members are finding it increasingly difficult to source
carriers that are willing to transport hazardous materials that have
satisfied all U.S. requirements for maritime shipping to ensure the
safety and security of the container.
The issue of NACD members having extreme difficulty finding
carriers that will transport hazardous materials is of great concern.
These chemical products are vital to national security, including
chemicals used to support essential infrastructure operations and are
necessary components of life saving medical treatments. Many ocean
carriers have refused to transport hazardous materials that are
required for water treatment, power generation, sanitation, and
pharmaceutical production.
Furthermore, those that are willing to transport these chemicals
have continuously increased the costs associated with doing so.
To understand the impact this shipping crisis has had on our member
companies, we've conducted ongoing surveys. Our most recent survey
found:

84.5% companies out of stock of at least some imported
product;

82.1% of respondents reporting average delays of eleven
or more days;

72.6% reporting being charged additional premiums by
carriers beyond tariffs and contract rates;

89.3% of respondents reported losses and half of those
are above $100,000, and;

166% rise in shipping costs in the last three months.

Without intervention, the chemicals that our national
infrastructure relies on are at risk of running out. The products NACD
member companies import are an important part of the American economy
and a critical component of American manufacturing, and for over a
year, ocean carriers have made importing increasingly difficult.
One solution NACD encourages this Committee to advance is the
bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act (H.R.4996), introduced by
Representatives Garamendi (CA) and Johnson (SD). This bill would be the
first major update to federal law on global shipping since 1998 and
aims to address the unfair playing field in which ocean shippers have
been forced to operate. NACD is proud to join hundreds of other trade
associations and companies representing a wide range of importers,
exporters, and other supply chain stakeholders in supporting this
legislation.
NACD was pleased that the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC)
convened the inaugural National Shipper Advisory Committee, and that
Brian Bumpass of NACD member, Brenntag North America, Inc., was
selected as the Committee's Chair. NACD has called for the FMC to take
concrete action to protect American importers, exporters, and consumers
from ongoing unfair and deceptive shipping practices. We hope that this
Committee will be a resource for FMC to better understand the impact
that excessive rates, fines, and fees are having on importers,
exporters, other supply chain partners, and American consumers.
Finally, as a short-term solution to alleviating the severe
congestion at U.S. ports, NACD urges Congress to promote better
communication among ocean carriers, all ports capable of unloading
ships, and the federal government. It has become clear that a lack of
communication between these parties has further stymied the efforts to
relieve port congestion. Smaller scale ports throughout the U.S. that
possess the capabilities necessary to unload many of cargo ships
anchored across the U.S. are not being fully utilized for various
reason. These reasons include the aforementioned lack of communication
between the parties involved, as well as the absence of U.S. Custom and
Border Protection (CBP) agents at smaller ports that are needed to
oversee the imports. NACD encourages CBP to dispatch agents to these
smaller, under-utilized ports to help ease some congestion at larger
ports.
NACD appreciates the attention of this Committee to this issue, and
we encourage you to ensure that the voice of critical infrastructure
sectors like the chemical industry are part of the conversation. We
stand ready to work with you to ensure the continued supply of goods
that are critical to national security and economic prosperity.

Letter of October 4, 2021, to Hon. John Garamendi and Hon. Dusty
Johnson from Anne Reinke, President and Chief Executive Officer,
Transportation Intermediaries Association, Submitted for the Record by
Hon. John Garamendi
October 4, 2021.
The Honorable John Garamendi,
U.S. House of Representatives,
2368 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Dusty Johnson,
U.S. House of Representatives,
1714 Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Congressmen Garamendi and Johnson:
On behalf of the more than 1,800 member companies of the
Transportation Intermediaries Association (TIA) to voice our support
for your legislation, H.R. 4996, the ``Ocean Shipping Reform Act.''
As you know, H.R. 4996 would finally empower the Federal Maritime
Commission (FMC) to crack down on aggressive retaliatory practices and
``unjust and unreasonable demurrage and detention rules and
practices,'' by directing the FMC to initiate a series of rulemakings.
TIA members have felt the pressure of delayed port times, container
shortages, overbearing demurrage and detention charges, and foreign
ocean carriers that do not play fair. While the bill is not a cure-all,
this is a great first step, as it is the first major update to our
ocean shipping laws since 2001.
TIA is the professional organization of the $214 billion third-
party logistics industry. With over 1,800-member companies, TIA is the
only organization exclusively representing transportation
intermediaries of all disciplines doing business in domestic and
international commerce.
We support and applaud your efforts to establish this new level of
oversight at the ports and in the shipping community. If you have any
questions about TIA or our position on H.R. 4996, please do not
hesitate to contact me or my Vice-President of Government Affairs,
Chris Burroughs.
Sincerely,
Anne Reinke,
President & CEO, Transportation Intermediaries Association.

Question from Hon. Peter A. DeFazio to Mario Cordero, Executive
Director, Port of Long Beach, on behalf of the American Association of
Port Authorities

Question 1. Who is responsible for correcting our supply chain
challenges?
Answer. Everyone who is involved in the supply chain plays a
responsibility in correcting the challenges we see today.
The current supply chain crisis has had many contributing factors,
but it essentially comes down to a single cause--the COVID-19 pandemic.
The contributing factors are the surge of cargo, high number of
unscheduled vessel calls, a supply chain workforce impacted by COVID-
19, and workplace accommodations throughout the supply chain that can
limit capacity.
We must remember that congestion is not unique to the San Pedro Bay
port complex. Many of the supply chain challenges we are witnessing
were already occurring prior to the pandemic, but are now magnified due
to our high cargo volumes.
Socio-economic factors, which caused the surge in cargo, should be
examined from a policy perspective. The Port of Long Beach is committed
to working closely with port stakeholders to find solutions and to
facilitate the smooth, reliable and prompt movement of cargo through
the port complex.

Questions from Hon. Sam Graves to Mario Cordero, Executive Director,
Port of Long Beach, on behalf of the American Association of Port
Authorities

Question 1. Mr. Cordero, while this is more of an on-the-horizon
issue, the contract between West Coast terminals and the longshoreman
is due to expire next year. In the past, these negotiations have been
complicated and at times led to contentious situations that gridlocked
ports. Given this--
a.  What are some of the key issues you foresee in the next labor
contract discussions?
Answer. As you know, the talks are held between representatives of
the International Longshore and Warehouse Union for labor and the
Pacific Maritime Association for management. The port authorities are
not part of the discussions. Generally, past negotiations have centered
on wages, benefits--including health care--and various other issues
such as automation.

b.  Should we be worried about these negotiations affecting port
operations?
Answer. I am hopeful that we will see a collaborative process that
will not materially affect port operations during this time when
everyone wants to catch up with the cargo volume.

c.  What role will the debate about increased automation have on
these contract negotiations?
Answer. We know that automation is a topic that comes up in the
negotiations, and it is the proper venue for discussions on the
subject. A very small percentage of the nation's terminals are
automated and labor and management is likely to negotiate regarding the
effect of automation on the workforce.

Question 2. What effect will the proposed 24/7 port operations at
Southern California ports have given that--
a.  The California Air Resources Board environmental requirements
would limit hours a truck can access the ports?
Answer. The Port of Long Beach has the most aggressive
environmental measures in the nation, and 24-7 operations should not
negatively contribute to air emissions.
Expanding the hours of ports diverts truck moves to night time,
mitigating roadway congestion and idling, thus reducing emissions.
Having 24-7 operations across the supply chain would disperse truck and
train activity across the 24-7 cycle, reducing congestion on roadways,
tracks and key inland points such as warehouses and distribution
centers.

b.  And that there is a lack of chassis for truckers to move goods
away from the port?
Answer. The chassis shortage has resulted in reduced efficiency of
operations--so the Port is working hard on increased container fluidity
which can free up chassis. Too many chassis can sit idle when the
container they carry has no place to be taken to, and can't be moved on
to the next node in the supply chain.

Question from Hon. Andre Carson to Mario Cordero, Executive Director,
Port of Long Beach, on behalf of the American Association of Port
Authorities

Question 1. Role of Rail (and Blocked Crossings)--After seeing so
much congestion at ports, I'd like to get your thoughts on what
positive role rail might play in strengthening our supply chain? Not
just in terms of more efficient movement of goods and materials, but
improving our human infrastructure too. Precision railroading sounds
impressive, but it just seems counter-intuitive to plan for longer
trains but smaller crew size. Our transportation systems are only as
strong as our people, our workers. And in a place like Indiana, the
Crossroads of America, we must also address the congestion on the roads
that unfortunately results when downtown and critical streets are
blocked by painfully long freight trains. How can these disruptions be
improved as we're working to strengthen our supply chains?
Answer. First, we would favor the increased use of ``short-haul''
rail which would allow the port complex to see import containers moved
quickly to an ``inland port,'' thus creating more capacity at seaports.
These inland depots could also be used to take on containers that are
occupying chassis, thus freeing up more equipment to move containers
out of the port by truck.
Second, increased use of on-dock rail--where cargo moves to and
from marine terminals solely by train--is a necessary part of
sustainably handling increasing capacity demands. We know from our own
region that grade separations and special rail corridors--like the
Alameda Corridor--can dramatically reduce the problem of roadways being
blocked by trains. We work together as a region to identify and support
such projects with one voice--whether they are close to the port or
not. These types of projects are absolutely a priority.

Questions from Hon. Michelle Steel to Mario Cordero, Executive
Director, Port of Long Beach, on behalf of the American Association of
Port Authorities

Question 1. I recently toured the Port with Darin Wright and other
members of your team. According to your testimony; 24-7 operations will
help mitigate the current surge. If warehouse facilities are at
capacity, how can drivers make deliveries?
Answer. We truly appreciate that you came out to see our operations
first-hand and we welcome members of the Committee to come and tour our
port complex any time.
The framework for 24-7 supply chain operations that President Biden
has supported will help to bring more links into the 24-7 operational
camp. We need the whole supply chain to participate in expanded hours
of operation, and that is the direction we are moving in.
There are varying degrees of warehouse capacity issues--and we rely
on the importers to work with their supply chain partners to better
manage their inventory and operations. Many import customers are also
reporting that they ``could not get their goods fast enough.''

Question 2. When will the port move to 3 shifts to truly be open
24/7? I was told you are currently at two shifts.
Answer. One of our six container terminals in September 2021 moved
to 24-hour operations for four nights a week. And we are speaking with
all of our terminals to consider doing the same.
The terminals are interested, but are cautious about the return of
investment on the costs.
However, we do have a growing consensus that a 24-7 supply chain
would be a solution to the level of cargo demand we are seeing. The
situation is evolving, and we expect to see more links in the supply
chain to find the means to move cargo around the clock.
A truck can pick up a container at 4 a.m. at the Port of Long Beach
today, but until the distribution centers and other supply chain nodes
are open at that time, it's going to be challenging to handle the
volumes of cargo we are seeing now and expect to see in the future.

Question 3. Do you think it was smart for cities to impose a
moratorium on new warehouses and truck facilities?
Answer. The various jurisdictions that have adopted temporary
moratoriums--Chino and Colton in the Inland region of Southern
California come to mind--should be given time to consider these
developments and if they are right for their communities. Each proposed
development must make a case for itself as to its worth to and respect
for the community. The Port of Long Beach is not immune to this issue.
As an industrial use, we must always make our case to our neighbors and
the larger community about our commitment to reducing our impacts and
to benefiting the region as a whole.

Question 4. As Chairman of the American Association of Port
Authorities, please provide detailed recommendations on the how the
Federal Government can partner with America's major seaports to create
an integrated data sharing and standardization platform to increase
visibility in the supply chain, in order to alleviate the
inefficiencies in the current system and set up usable and measurable
metrics that will move our ports into the 21st century.
Answer. The Port of Long Beach is currently developing a cloud-
based Supply Chain Information Highway that aims to create a repository
of curated data from all sources so that supply chain partners can come
and obtain data needed to improve their cargo visibility. The Supply
Chain Information Highway will be a trustworthy, transparent and non-
revenue-generating platform that could be rolled out to all ports in
the U.S. Once we have had the chance to implement the system, we will
certainly consider the means for widening its reach. We feel it has
potential to go coast to coast.

Question 5. According to the Administration about 100,000 empty
containers sit idle at the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, which
is having a negative impact on the U.S. supply chain. Please provide
specific details on the actions the Port of Long Beach is employing to
facilitate a quicker and more efficient return of empty containers to
overseas ports.
Answer. With the support of our ocean carriers and their sweeper
vessels, we are evacuating empty containers from our terminals. Empty
containers as of Dec. 16 accounted for 36% of all containers on
terminals. This is down from 45% just a couple of weeks prior.
By evacuating empty containers from the terminals, we are making
space for more inbound containers. We are not out of the woods yet, but
we are making meaningful progress.
With the continued collaboration from our industry partners, the
support from our government partners, and the focus on near-term
solutions, we expect to continue to see progress in the months ahead.
The Port has also allocated 100 acres of land as a buffer to store
containers and alleviate capacity pressure at the terminals.

Question 6. Please provide your recommendations on what needs to be
done--legislatively or through regulatory actions (state and federal)
to encourage foreign-owned ocean carriers to take ownership of their
role in accepting and evacuating the tens of thousands of empty
containers that clog the LA/Long Beach ports and the region. These
empty containers and the lack of action by foreign owned carriers are a
lead contributor to a shortage of land space and chassis.
Answer. While we have had success in working with our ocean
carriers to have them deploy sweeper vessels to retrieve empty
containers, one thing that could be considered is to require carriers
to submit plans about how they will manage container inventory (in/out/
empties) and matching chassis capacity when they establish contracts
with terminals.

Question 7. Please explain and provide insight into how the Port of
Long Beach will use the infrastructure funds from the IIJA to maximize
the effect on freight fluidity, for example intermodal connectors,
modernization, on-dock projects, and so forth.
Answer. We're prepared with several on-dock rail projects in the
pipeline to make our case for funding from the IIJA. These rail
projects all will create physical capacity that will allow the Port to
meet the future supply chain challenges. Some of the funds could also
be allocated for the digital infrastructure so that physical facilities
could be utilized more efficiently based on the analytics the digital
platforms could provide.

Question 8. Do you agree that since many foreign-owned ocean
carriers have already indicated they will plan to pass the new LA/LB
dwell fees along to shippers/BCOs, that these fees are simply a
``double dip'' on existing demurrage fee structures, to which cargo is
already subject? And, were the dwell fees and the coordinated action to
develop them discussed with the Federal Maritime Commission?
Answer. Not so from the Port's perspective. The demurrage rule was
established to provide reasonable time for container delivery. The
Container Dwell Fee is a mechanism created during a challenging time to
provide another layer of motivation to push containers out of the
terminals. It is temporary in nature and for a specific circumstance.
The Port does not intend for the fee to be passed-through but has no
jurisdiction over ocean carriers on this matter.

Question from Hon. Steve Cohen to Mario Cordero, Executive Director,
Port of Long Beach, on behalf of the American Association of Port
Authorities

Question 1. I understand that dwell time of intermodal equipment--
the time between picking up equipment and returning it--is impacting
the supply chain. Can you explain what that means to cargo fluidity and
tell us what actions are being taken to reduce dwell time?
Answer. We are working closely with our chassis providers and BCOs
to find the means to reduce detention time and get equipment back to
work in moving containers. At the Port we've opened up 100 acres to
allow for additional cargo storage, which frees up chassis. We are also
looking for areas outside the harbor district where the two ports could
facilitate the opening of additional container storage.

Questions from Hon. Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon to Mario Cordero,
Executive Director, Port of Long Beach, on behalf of the American
Association of Port Authorities

Question 1. Mr. Cordero, if we have been experiencing a bottleneck
at the Port of Long Beach, why has the port not moved to 24/7
operations already? What is preventing the port from addressing the
backlog?
Answer. One of our six container terminals in September moved to
24-hour operations for four days a week. And we are speaking with all
of our terminals to consider doing the same. These terminals are
publicly owned but privately operated, so any change in operation
schedules requires negotiation between parties. For 24-7 operations to
be effective, all nodes in the supply chain must be cooperative. Even
if a truck picks up a container in the middle of the night, if
distribution centers are not open at the same time, there is no effect
on the backlog.
The terminals are interested, but are cautious about the return of
investment on the costs. However, we do have a growing consensus that a
24-7 supply chain would be a solution to the level of cargo demand we
are seeing. The situation is evolving, and we expect to see more links
in the supply chain to find the means to move cargo around the clock.
We have taken several measures to reduce the backlog:

We have repurposed more than a hundred acres of vacant
land in the port for container storage.

All of our terminals have expanded their hours of
operation throughout the week and added some weekend shifts.

Our new container dwell fee at the San Pedro Bay
continues to have an impact. Long-dwelling cargo containers are down by
47 percent at the San Pedro Bay ports complex since the fee was
announced in late October.

By moving these containers out of the terminals, we are
creating the capacity the terminals need to bring those ships at anchor
to berth.

Question 2. Mr. Cordero, Puerto Rico, being an island, has 3.2
million people that are reliant on infrastructure that ensures the
highest levels of port performance and efficiencies, reliable maritime
and air service, for people to get everything from mail to medicine.
The Port of San Juan is the Top 25 busiest ports in American
according the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) for containers
with 1.39 million T. E. U. containers arriving annually for a
population that would be the 30th largest state by population according
to the 2020 Census.
In your testimony, you note that the Department of Transportation
will open $240 million through the Port Infrastructure Development
Program within 45 days and an additional $475 million within 90 days.
How can we ensure that this funding will be spread out at ports across
the country?
Answer. We do expect that this Administration will seek to deploy
the funding fairly. The Port of Long Beach this year will handle more
than 9 million TEUs with cargo reaching every corner of the nation.
Together with our neighbor the Port of Los Angeles, that figure is 20
million TEUs. No port complex in this hemisphere has such capacity that
services the entire nation.
Traditionally, the San Pedro Bay ports have not received a share of
funding to match their impact on the U.S.
That said, we do understand the needs of ports around the country,
and we join the industry in being in favor of routine and regular
funding of port infrastructure, not just a one-time funding measure.
The Port Infrastructure Development Program also has a restriction,
already in law, that no more than 15% of grant funds may go to any one
state, so there are protections in place to ensure funds are
distributed across the nation.

Question 3. Mr. Cordero, during your tenure as Chairman of the
Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), the FMC under Commissioner Rebecca
Dye took the lead to stand up an industry lead, voluntary, working
groups to help address port performance and tried to come up with
common sense solutions to improve efficiencies. Do you think this is
something the committee should authorize so that the private sector and
labor unions come up with industry and union driven solutions?
Answer. Yes, the industry has many diverse participants who could
offer a wealth of expertise and experience to the conversation.

Question 4. What kind of funding would it take to bring automation
to the Port of Long Beach?
Answer. We're not looking for automation funding at this time.

a.  To other major ports?
Answer. That would depend on those ports' needs and what the needs
of their communities are.

Question from Hon. Stephen F. Lynch to Mario Cordero, Executive
Director, Port of Long Beach, on behalf of the American Association of
Port Authorities

Question 1. While ports are a cornerstone of the U.S. economy,
outdated infrastructure and the COVID-19 pandemic have strained their
capacity and jeopardized global supply chains. According to the 2021
Report Card for America's Infrastructure Report issued by the American
Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), in 2018, America's ports supported
more than 30 million jobs and approximately 26% of our nation's GDP.
Federal, State and Local governments have invested millions of dollars
in our regional ports to serve the global shipping industry. However,
the ASCE report card warns that ports face extensive challenges
modernizing infrastructure and maintaining essential facilities under
threat from sea level rise and other climate challenges.
a.  What are you doing to push the industry to utilize these
regional gateways to address the supply congestion at the nation's
largest ports?
Answer. At the Port of Long Beach we have one of the most
aggressive capital improvement programs in the nation to address all
the needs as you have stated--cargo growth, sustainability and climate
change adaptation. We feel that our projects and programs are examples
of how ports can meet the challenges of the future. We always seem to
demonstrate the economic benefits of projects for the safe, efficient
and reliable movement of cargo.

Question from Hon. John Garamendi to Mario Cordero, Executive Director,
Port of Long Beach, on behalf of the American Association of Port
Authorities

Question 1. Reportedly, some 40 percent of determination and
demurrage fees invoiced to shippers are either partially refund or
reduced. Mr. Cordero, do you agree that seemingly high refund or
reduction rate indicates a fundamental problem with how ocean carriers
and their involving agents are billing for detention and demurrage?
Answer. Possibly. However, each ocean carrier and terminal operator
operates differently. The Port does not have visibility as to the bases
of these transactions. There are also many operational issues that
might result in the adjustments to the invoices.

Questions from Hon. Seth Moulton to Mario Cordero, Executive Director,
Port of Long Beach, on behalf of the American Association of Port
Authorities

Question 1. Mr. Cordero, how has the partnership between Union
Pacific and the port authorities of California and Utah expedited
getting containers out of the Port of Long Beach? Are there any lessons
we can draw from this example to improve the movement of goods in the
U.S. even after we emerge from our current challenges?
Answer. The Port has been engaging in intensive conversation with
UIPA on utilizing Salt Lake City as a mid-way point between the Port
and Midwest. In the short- and long-run, it is a good solution to help
alleviate terminal capacity constraints in Southern California. The
Port is also interested in establishing additional discussions with
other inland cities.

Questions from Hon. Nikema Williams to Mario Cordero, Executive
Director, Port of Long Beach, on behalf of the American Association of
Port Authorities

Question 1. Let's get down to what this hearing is truly about:
It's about that tired parent on a grocery run seeing empty shelves
where their weekly necessities used to be; It's about my son, Carter,
ordering something on Amazon with his tooth fairy money and not getting
it for weeks and weeks; It's about a growing family looking for the new
car they need and not finding anything on the lots; It's about the many
constituents who I've talked to who are in the restaurant business and
can't get paper supplies for the to-go orders; and it's about those,
including myself, not getting the simplest things, like mild sauce at
Taco Bell!
Plain and simple, we're having issues getting products to the
people because we've underinvested for too long in transportation and
infrastructure. Luckily, y'all, infrastructure week is finally here.
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law Monday
by President Biden will start to address these types of problems for my
constituents, including by sending $8 million immediately to the Port
of Savannah.
a.  Mr. Cordero, help connect the dots for us: How does investing
in something like a port help my constituents get their goods, for
example, something as simple as a mild sauce from Taco Bell? How
exactly can this investment be used to make goods move more
efficiently?
Answer. The supply chain is a very diversified entity. While some
of the items you are thinking of may be domestically produced, it could
be that components, ingredients, and bottles/boxes/containers could be
sourced overseas. Investing in the ports, especially the Port of Long
Beach, will help ensure that critical components or finished products
could be transported quickly to consumers. So any one product--such as
sauce made by the Southern California-headquartered Taco Bell--could
have several points of origin. Investing in seaports is a means of
making the supply chain healthier.

b.  The pandemic has created bottlenecks everywhere from our ports
to our airports. In my district, Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta Airport and
Delta Airlines have been hard hit by decreased passenger traffic. But
as I've heard from NCR, a Fortune 500 company in my district, the
impact of this issue extends to the supply chain, too. Mr. Cordero, how
has reduced air passenger travel impacted the space available to
transport materials and goods? As more passengers fly again, can
growing freight space ease the supply chain crunch that some of the
companies in my district are facing?
Answer. There is a direct correlation between air cargo capacity
and the current supply chain challenges in the ocean transportation
sector. The suspended flights reduced the cargo-carrying capacity even
in the passenger aircrafts. Many users of that mode of transportation
sought capacity instead in container vessels. Some fast-moving
electronic goods are now moving instead in the ocean transportation
routes and are caught in the backlog. Resumption of cargo and passenger
flights will alleviate a part of the challenge.

Question from Hon. Peter A. DeFazio to Chris Spear, President and Chief
Executive Officer, American Trucking Associations

Question 1. Who is responsible for correcting our supply chain
challenges?
Answer. The global supply chain is an incredibly dynamic, complex
system. We've seen how one ship grounded in a canal halfway around the
world can unleash a torrent of downstream effects felt directly by the
American consumer. As the most central and critical link in that supply
chain, the trucking industry understands that complexity well. Any time
the supply chain is pressured, our members feel it in one form or
another.
That's why we know that correcting our current supply chain
challenges requires a multi-faceted approach--not one bound by the
pursuit of a single solution, but rather a commitment from all
stakeholders on working together to ensure our economy's freight needs
are always met. The federal government can play a constructive role
here, as should the private sector--but with a shared understanding
that not all modes are the same. Operations differ. One-size-fits-all
policy prescriptions can often have unintended consequences that make
bad situations worse. That's especially true when dealing with systems
as complex as the supply chain.
We see the recently-passed H.R.4996 as a strong example of how
government and private sector can work together to correct supply chain
challenges. This legislation passed a divided Congress with
overwhelming bipartisan support, and we hope the Senate quickly follows
the House's lead. The bill was written with informed input from supply
chain stakeholders who regularly experience the inequities that
hamstring our port systems. Too often, mega, foreign-owned ocean
carriers abuse the system to line their own pockets at the expense of
small American trucking companies and broader supply chain efficiency.
Informed policymaking is critical. We encourage all members of the
Committee to visit a trucking company back in their home districts.
Seeing the daily operations of motor carriers is fundamental to
understanding how our industry works. Solutions cut from white boards
in graduate school lecture halls will fall woefully short of rising to
the challenge of this current moment. Meeting those people on the
ground is a necessity. It's there that you'll get to know the 7.8
million dedicated, hard-working Americans who move our economy forward.

Question from Hon. Sam Graves to Chris Spear, President and Chief
Executive Officer, American Trucking Associations

Question 1. Mr. Spear, various data and analysis has been presented
to the Committee by other witnesses regarding truck driver shortages,
in particular Mr. David Correll. However, I am concerned that this data
and analysis may not provide the whole picture and narrowly targets
under-utilization despite multi-faceted issues. Could you address some
of the inefficiencies detailed in Mr. Correll's testimony and elaborate
on how ATA views the multi-faceted nature of the truck driver shortage
and share any analysis you have conducted?
Answer. While ATA appreciates a diverse set of opinions when
formulating solutions to the national truck driver shortage, we take
issue with both the methodology underpinning Dr. Correll's research as
well as the validity of his conclusions. In fact, Congress and the
American people would be ill-advised to take policy or practical action
based on Dr. Correll's hearing suggestions, which misrepresented a vast
and diverse industry.
In sum, Dr. Correll posited that the national truck driver shortage
can be boiled down to an issue of driver ``under-utilization,'' in
which the existing driver workforce is not getting enough work. In
other words, he argues the solution is not to increase the headcount of
drivers but to instead squeeze more out of current workforce, citing
driver detention as a leading source of wasted time and productivity.
While we appreciate greater attention being drawn to driver detention
at shipper facilities and agree that reducing detention time is key to
increasing supply-chain efficiency, singling out this issue as a means
to remedy the long-term driver shortage is problematic on multiple
fronts and grossly oversimplifies the complexity of the issue. It also
suffers from a complete lack of practicality based on the academic
nature of his observations, which he himself notes are based on
anecdotal data from only two carriers, and a basic mathematical issue.
As I detailed in my testimony, the driver shortage is a multi-
faceted challenge with myriad contributing factors, many of which
revolve around lifestyle preferences. Take for instance driver
compensation: Long-haul earnings are up 24.3% since the beginning of
2019, increasing at a rate nearly five times their historical average.
Yet, the driver shortage grew over that same time period, from 61,500
to 80,000. When drivers earn more per mile, many choose to drive less--
opting to spend more time at home than on the road. Data in the
aggregate confirms this fact: In the 1990s, the average miles per truck
per year were approximately 125,000; today, they are down approximately
to 100,000. Basic math from that premise alone would require 20% more
drivers today for the exact same level of capacity as available during
the 1990s--and the freight demands have substantially grown over that
period.
This of course undercuts Dr. Correll's central thesis that the
driver shortage can be remedied through better ``utilization'' of
drivers' time. In his testimony, he identifies weekends as a dearth of
productivity, with long-haul drivers doing most of their driving on
weekdays. There's a simple explanation for that: drivers want to be
home on the weekend, spending time with their families, attending
church services or their kids' little league games and dance recitals--
just like the rest of us. Strategies that aim to squeeze more out of
the current driver workforce or increase their working hours threaten
to exacerbate the truck driver shortage or reduce safety, not remedy
the supply-chain difficulties.
As Dr. Correll acknowledged on the record during the hearing, the
data underpinning all of his conclusions stems from analysis of roughly
``4,000 over the road truck drivers employed by one mid-sized and one
large national carrier in snapshots from 2016 to 2020,'' as well as
unspecified transactional data provided by shippers and brokers.
Incredibly, his conclusions about the entire trucking industry are
based on a sample size that covers two out of 1.2 million trucking
fleets in the U.S., 0.2% of the drivers nationwide (using the Census
Bureau estimate of 1.8 million for-hire over-the-road truck drivers he
cites later in his testimony), and 0.1% of commercial driver's license
holders nationwide. It is also worth noting in this context that Dr.
Correll fails to reference that over 90% of motor carriers in the
United States have less than 10 trucks meaning that his two carrier
sample is completely unrepresentative.
Furthermore, there's no indication that Dr. Correll considered the
varying operations that exist across private fleets, lengths of haul,
and categories of freight. Detention times differ widely depending on
industry sector, and conflating refrigerated transportation,
agricultural haulers, fuel haulers, flatbed haulers, less-than-
truckload operations, specialized delivery, and white-glove last-mile
services neglects the diversity, depth and breadth of the trucking
industry. For example, detention is a far more prevalent issue for
drayage and dry-van, truckload carriers; yet the driver shortage
persists across all industry sectors.
To calculate the amount of time per day that drivers are ``under-
utilized,'' Dr. Correll performs simple long division over cherry-
picked elements of Federal hours-of-service (HOS) regulations. The 11-
hour maximum driving time that Mr. Correll cites is only available to a
very limited number of drivers under specific circumstances (e.g.,
adverse weather conditions), which he does not acknowledge in any
detail. In reality, hours-of-service rules for drivers are capped at 60
hours of on-duty time over seven consecutive days (8.5 hours a day) or
70 hours of on-duty time over eight consecutive days (8.75 hours a day)
if the motor carrier operates vehicles every day of the week. (Most
drivers are likely up against their 60/70 hour duty clock even if they
are working 5 days a week. The HOS clock counts ``on-duty and driving''
time, so even sitting at a shipper ``underutilized'' counts towards
this time. Meaning, simply working 7-days a week is not an option,
unless they're going to work far less each day on average.)
If we accept at face value Dr. Correll's estimation that drivers
spend 6.5 hours per working day driving their vehicles, and factor in
standard contractual terms between shippers and carriers of two hours
for loading and unloading, then the arithmetic reveals drivers are
already operating at, essentially, peak efficiency given the federal
HOS cap of 8.5 hours per day over seven consecutive days.
(Theoretically, if a driver worked M-F at the maximum 14 hours each
day, they could take 34 hours off to reset their clock to 0 and go back
to work on the next Monday for another 14 hours. Very few drivers would
want to work the maximum allowable duty time over an extended period
even if motor carriers provided that option.) Never mind that 2021
freight volumes are already higher than they were at any point in his
2016-2020 study period.
It is unsurprising that Dr. Correll overlooked these factors given
his acknowledgment that he has negligible real-world experience at
trucking terminals, rail head, ports, shipper docks, distribution
centers, and other facility critical to supply chain operations and
driver productivity. While perhaps not disqualifying as a subject
matter witness, Dr. Correll's lack of first-hand knowledge of the
trucking industry's integral role throughout the supply chain certainly
warrants concern about the validity of his conclusions.
The purpose of hearings we believe is to impart information to the
Congress to consider for better understanding and addressing public
policy issues like the current supply-chain problems. Relying on Dr.
Correll's data and conclusions to produce any sort of response, and
particularly his narrow and isolated academic ideas of the government
measuring efficiency metrics across the supply chain and somehow
enforcing improvement requirements more efficiently than the market,
will not work in the long or short term. Those who deny the obvious
fact that the industry needs more drivers immediately and for the
foreseeable future are doing the country a disservice and ignoring
real-world facts--and in some instances engaging in fiction to advance
parochial interests. The House of Representatives' Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee deserves better.
The American Trucking Associations is committed to enhancing driver
productivity and well-being, and we look forward to working with you,
Congress, and the Biden Administration on responsible, data-driven
legislation that would expand opportunities for all Americans.

Question from Hon. Andre Carson to Chris Spear, President and Chief
Executive Officer, American Trucking Associations

Question 1. Role of Rail (and Blocked Crossings)--After seeing so
much congestion at ports, I'd like to get your thoughts on what
positive role rail might play in strengthening our supply chain? Not
just in terms of more efficient movement of goods and materials, but
improving our human infrastructure too. Precision railroading sounds
impressive, but it just seems counter-intuitive to plan for longer
trains but smaller crew size. Our transportation systems are only as
strong as our people, our workers. And in a place like Indiana, the
Crossroads of America, we must also address the congestion on the roads
that unfortunately results when downtown and critical streets are
blocked by painfully long freight trains. How can these disruptions be
improved as we're working to strengthen our supply chains?
Answer. The trucking industry works closely with our railroad
partners to move America's freight. While the vast majority of truck
shipments are not rail competitive, intermodal truck-rail deliveries
play an important role in the supply chain, notably the movement of
containers. Congress can help to strengthen intermodal freight supply
chains by investing in roads that connect intermodal terminals to the
National Highway System. Although these arteries serve critical
national needs, too many are poorly maintained or highly congested.

Question from Hon. Michelle Steel to Chris Spear, President and Chief
Executive Officer, American Trucking Associations

Question 1. Please explain in more detail how the how the
restrictive appointment systems and constraints on return of empty
containers imposed by terminal operators and ocean carriers in LA/LB
have made it so challenging for dray drivers to effectively move
containers and to make a living doing so. Do you have recommendations
or solutions that would fix these problems?
Answer. The appointment system and inability to return containers
goes to the heart of the difficulties faced by drayage drivers at the
ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. The lack of available empty return
locations means that motor carrier yards are full of containers
awaiting returns. Despite the inability to return them, many of these
containers are racking up detention charges as ocean carrier billing
systems automatically generate invoices as soon as free days expire
regardless of whether a return location is available. Further, these
containers often are sitting on chassis meaning these chassis are not
available to pick up new imports arriving at the ports. The lack of
chassis is another key contributor to the slowdown. Finally, the lack
of integrated appointment systems brings unneeded complexities for
motor carriers working across the various terminals in the port system.
There are 12 container terminals combined in the two ports which use at
least 6 different appointment IT systems. The lack of integration
between terminals creates complications and significant reductions in
efficiencies as information cannot be shared among terminals.
Integrating information systems between ports and marine terminals
would allow motor carriers and other supply chain partners to better
allocate equipment and personnel to where they can be put to best use.

Question from Hon. Stephen F. Lynch to Chris Spear, President and Chief
Executive Officer, American Trucking Associations

Question 1. While ports are a cornerstone of the U.S. economy,
outdated infrastructure and the COVID-19 pandemic have strained their
capacity and jeopardized global supply chains. According to the 2021
Report Card for America's Infrastructure Report issued by the American
Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), in 2018, America's ports supported
more than 30 million jobs and approximately 26% of our nation's GDP.
Federal, State and Local governments have invested millions of dollars
in our regional ports to serve the global shipping industry. However,
the ASCE report card warns that ports face extensive challenges
modernizing infrastructure and maintaining essential facilities under
threat from sea level rise and other climate challenges.
a.  What are you doing to push the industry to utilize these
regional gateways to address the supply congestion at the nation's
largest ports?
Answer. The congestion at our nation's ports has put a premium on
space. One of the key issues facing motor carriers is the lack of
available locations for empty returns which are both occupying space in
truck yards and sitting on the chassis that are badly-needed to pick up
newly-arrived containers. We are working with ports and marine terminal
operators to help them use all available resources to maximize their
available space in order to solve this growing problem.

Questions from Hon. Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon to Chris Spear, President
and Chief Executive Officer, American Trucking Associations

Question 1. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, the
last surface bill that was enacted prior to the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act, which was just signed this week, contained a
section on Port Metrics to help reduce areas of bottlenecks.
Currently the Bureau of Transportation Statistics reports monthly
on the number of 20-foot equivalents at the Nation's 10 largest ports.
However, this reporting does not give any information on the efficiency
of the port itself.
It does not tell us whether or not labor is moving as efficiently
as it could day over day, it doesn't tell us if there are issues with
scales and gate times, it doesn't tell us if trucks are waiting longer
than normal or if there aren't any berths available, it doesn't tell us
how many crane lifts occur. These are all factors that affect port
efficiency.
a.  Mr. Spear, do you think it will help your members if gate wait
and turn times are reported in real time so truck operators are able to
better plan their pickup and drop off times to better utilize their
hours-of-service?
Answer. One of the major deficiencies in our intermodal supply
chain is the lack of real time data visibility and standardization.
Without the ability to have a global understanding of cargo
information, motor carriers are unable to operate in the most effective
and efficient manner. Maritime cargo does not just arrive overnight.
There is a long lead time and better integration of information between
marine terminals, ocean carriers and shippers would allow for better
planning regarding when cargo is arriving and how to handle it. Gate
wait and listed turn times also provide an example of how this lack of
real time information can hinder container movement. While most ports
provide information regarding turn times, they are often measured from
the time trucks enter the terminal gate despite the fact that wait time
outside the gate can be considerable. Providing better data regarding
the actual wait times for motor carriers would allow companies to have
a better understanding of real time activity in order to better
allocate resources.

b.  What additional information are we missing from ports activity
reporting that would help shippers and carriers be able to make the
most informed decisions to help reduce bottlenecks and improve
efficiencies?
Answer. Real time data visibility and standardization are what's
needed most. If the trucking industry is able to secure this
information real-time, it will help improve intermodal transportation.

Question 2. Mr. Spear, I appreciate your testimony highlighting the
need for workforce development. To address workforce development and
increased safety, I have introduced H.R. 1967, which would allow Puerto
Rico to issue Commercial Driver's Licenses to truck drivers in Puerto
Rico. It would require drivers to increase their skills while operating
a motor carrier and give anyone moving to or from Puerto Rico a license
that they could use anywhere in the country.
a.  I've asked ATA to review this legislation for their support
which I have yet to receive an answer. As the President and CEO, can
you commit to providing a response to my office?
Answer. ATA supports the provisions outlined in H.R. 1967, and has
communicated this support to Congressional staff. We believe that
aligning Puerto Rico's Commercial Drivers' License standards with U.S.
standards, as outlined in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations,
would both increase safety standards and streamline the issuance of
Puerto Rico-issued licenses.

Question 3. Mr. Spear, because I have served on this committee and
I have experienced what it's like to represent Puerto Rico during and
after the devastation of Hurricanes Irma and Maria which devastated the
whole infrastructure network of the island, I have learned how critical
good roads and bridges, port connections, and port operations are to
the movement of freight. According to the American Society of Civil
Engineers, Puerto Rico's roads, bridges, and ports need more than $3.85
billion to bring our network to a state of good repair.
In your testimony you advocate for $5 billion in annual funding to
address bottlenecks. Is this adequate to ensure that the transportation
of goods is competitive but efficient for consumers?
Answer. Based on various studies, highway investment needs to at
least double to address current maintenance and capacity backlogs and
prevent further system deterioration over at least the next two
decades. If this increase in resources does not materialize--and IIJA,
while representing a significant increase, did not provide the
necessary funding boost--then federal investment must be directed
toward projects that are likely to provide the best return on
investment. In that regard, a $5 billion annual set-aside for highway
freight bottlenecks is the best approach. These bottlenecks
disproportionately increase the cost of moving freight, and most of
them also have significant passenger vehicle traffic.

Question 4. What can this committee do to help the trucking
industry shift toward alternative fuel powered vehicles?
Answer. The highest hurdles to overcome to expedite the
introduction of alternative-fueled vehicles into the trucking sector
are the availability of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell
electric vehicles (FCEVs) across all truck classes and the build-out of
robust fueling infrastructures. Hydrogen fuel cell technology
development, while lagging behind that of BEVs, will likely play a
critical role for long-range freight hauling needs. Manufacturers are
already ramping up production of BEV trucks and we expect that
trajectory to steadily increase. Fleets need the assurance of having
these new fuels available prior to making their purchasing decisions.
The nation's diesel fueling infrastructure had seventy-five years to
mature yet EV charging and hydrogen fueling locations are being pressed
not only to supplant fossil fuel use, but to do so with brevity. To
advance this unprecedented task will require far more tax breaks and
financial incentives for both private and public alternative fueling
locations. Likewise, these fueling sites will falter without vehicles
demanding their product. BEVs and FCEVs can cost several-fold more than
conventional diesel trucks. Until the costs of these next-generation
alternative-fueled vehicles become cost competitive with their diesel
counterparts, fleets will need on-going tax credits and financial
incentives to fulfill the nation's decarbonization aims for the
transport sector.
Trucking companies are also facing major challenges related to
equipment availability and delays as a result of the global
semiconductor chip shortage, which is slowing the delivery of newer,
cleaner power units and trailers. Congressional action to address the
chip shortage is an important near-term step that will make more
efficient and environmentally-friendly equipment available to our
nation's fleets.

Question 5. Mr. Spear, aside from the voluntary vehicles miles
traveled (VMT) program in the bill, how does the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act address funding infrastructure projects and the
long term solvency of the Highway Trust Fund?
Answer. Unfortunately, the IIJA did not address the long-term
solvency of the Highway Trust Fund. The revenue measures are temporary
in nature and it is likely that by the time IIJA expires, the HTF will
once more face insolvency. While a replacement for the fuel tax as the
primary revenue source for the HTF must be found, this will likely take
at least a decade. In the meantime, ATA believes that increasing the
fuel tax rate is the best way to provide a predictable, stable source
of revenue for the HTF.

Questions from Hon. Sharice Davids to Chris Spear, President and Chief
Executive Officer, American Trucking Associations

Question 1. We've heard a lot in the news about issues with the
supply chain, and I'm glad we've got folks from different perspectives
joining us here today to talk about solutions.
Because if we can address some of the supply chain issues and ease
the consumer prices we are seeing, we can address rising costs for
families across the country.
One solution I've been focused on, through my work on this
committee and the Small Business Committee, is workforce development
and training.
To start, I was an original cosponsor on a bill, the Promoting
Women in Trucking Workforce Act, to expand and encourage women to join
the trucking workforce. Currently, women only make up 24 percent of all
transportation and warehousing jobs.
I've also been working with local community colleges in my
district, including my alma mater Johnson County Community College, to
promote their commercial drivers license programs. I just announced a
grant is going to that program that will allow 12 veterans to receive
scholarships and get their CDL.
Mr. Spear, what can we do to work with you all to encourage a more
diverse group of folks to enter the workforce? Do you think that could
begin to alleviate supply chain blocks or accelerate supply chain
successes?
Answer. First, thank you for your tenacious leadership and
collaboration on the Promoting Women in Trucking Workforce Act, a bill
that will support women pursuing careers in the trucking industry.
Implementation of measures such as the Promoting Women in Trucking
Workforce Act and the Promoting Service in Transportation Act, both of
which were included in the bipartisan infrastructure law, will help the
industry increase our workforce's diversity and attract the next
generation of talent. I strongly believe that bringing in new drivers
and supply chain workers, and providing them with the training they
need to operate safely and productively, is a critical step in
addressing the current supply chain challenges and ensuring a more
resilient economy for the future. ATA looks forward to working with
Congress and the Department of Transportation to roll out those
programs and welcome a diverse new generation of Americans into
fulfilling transportation careers.
Now that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has been
enacted, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation must
establish the apprenticeship pilot program described in Sec. 23022 of
the bill before January 14, 2022. Once implemented, the apprenticeship
pilot program will provide qualified 18- to 20-year-olds with a pathway
to a family-sustaining career in the trucking industry with a median
pay of $54,585, plus health and retirement benefits. The pilot program
represents an opportunity for emerging members of the American
workforce who have already obtained a commercial driver's license in
their state to develop the skills and abilities necessary to achieve a
stable career path as an interstate truck driver. Many members of
underserved communities have never been exposed to the career
opportunities that exist within the trucking industry, and the
apprenticeship program can be leveraged as a way to motivate new and
different members of the workforce toward positive and lasting career
opportunities in trucking that do not require the kind of debt that
accompanies much of higher education.

Question 2. I also want to think ahead, because current supply
chain issues are, of course, complicated by pent-up demand and other
pandemic factors. I've heard the supply chain problems we're
experiencing now described as a chain of dominoes falling into each
other. But I think there's an opportunity here to boost American
industry and labor while combating rising costs long-term.
We've been dependent on materials made in other countries for far
too long, and I think it's important that we use this as an opportunity
to invest in our economy, supply chains, and workforce, so we can lower
costs for working folks and avoid this supply chain crunch happening
again in the future.
We cannot just reset our dominoes--we need to stop the chain
reaction before it even begins.
An example would be the strong Buy America provisions in the
infrastructure bill we just passed, or continuing to boost
semiconductor and other critical material manufacturing here at home.
What policies do you see as critical to help businesses and
workforce ensure that our supply chain both recovers now--and is
prepared to address future issues and cost pressures?
Answer. Congress and the Administration can help address the driver
shortage by removing obsolete regulatory barriers and incentivizing
states to streamline the credentialing process while also providing a
meaningful investment in training the next generation of drivers and
mechanics through the various workforce funding streams. Likewise,
speedy implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
would best ensure a vibrant and diverse workforce that can support
ongoing American economic growth. More specifically, the Administration
may want to prioritize the provisions in the IIJA regarding the
commonsense apprenticeship program to train 18-20 year olds to drive in
interstate commerce, the Promoting Service in Transportation Act
provisions for DOT to advertise transportation jobs like truck driver
as a quality career path, and most importantly rapid deployment of the
funds to update infrastructure. Those three provisions are all
critically important to bolstering the resiliency of our supply chain
for the trucking industry. Similarly, reliable and predictable funding
going forward to maintain our nation's roads and bridges will yield
fewer bottlenecks and points of congestion, making our supply chains
more agile and efficient.

Question from Hon. Peter A. DeFazio to Ian Jefferies, President and
Chief Executive Officer, Association of American Railroads

Question 1. Who is responsible for correcting our supply chain
challenges?
Answer. The smooth functioning of rail terminals depends on supply
chain partners maintaining a consistent flow of freight out of
facilities to make room for other freight coming in. Unfortunately, in
recent months, many rail customers have been unable to effectively
process this flow of traffic, especially intermodal containers. When
containers coming in (``in-gates'') exceed containers going out (``out-
gates''), uncollected containers pile up, creating severe problems that
reverberate throughout the supply chain. When these and other related
problems become entrenched, it becomes extraordinarily difficult to
``reset'' the system to its normal level of throughput and reliability.
However, just as no one actor is to blame for the nation's supply
chain challenges, nor is any one entity responsible for fixing these
problems. Freight supply chains are complex systems driven by the
decisions, actions, and capacity of a wide variety of global and
domestic actors, including steamship lines; truckers; railroads;
pipelines; ports; drayage providers; owners of truck chassis, shipping
containers, and warehouses; as well as manufacturers, wholesalers, and
retailers of goods. All stakeholders must do their part to maintain a
consistent flow of freight at every step of the process, avoid
bottlenecks, and ensure that freight is delivered safely, efficiently,
and when expected.
America's freight railroads are doing their part--through
significant investments in their private infrastructure and equipment,
development and implementation of innovative technologies, and
operational enhancements--to maintain network fluidity and ensure
sufficient capacity to deliver the goods upon which our economy
depends. Railroads have and will continue to operate 24/7 and are also
partnering with their supply chain partners and customers to find
constructive ways to modify their operations and maintain network
fluidity. Railroads have also made a variety of online tools, apps, and
other technologies available to provide their customers with full
visibility regarding shipments' journeys over rail networks.
Policymakers can assist in these efforts by removing impediments to
effective solutions and encouraging the use of innovative technologies
to enhance safety and operational effectiveness. Congress should work
to ensure:

the STB maintains a balanced economic regulatory system
and rejects unwise rail regulations, such as forced switching;

the FRA incorporates a performance-based regulatory
framework and fosters innovation and testing of emerging technologies
that improve the safety and efficiency of rail operations, such as
automated track inspection;

the FRA avoids imposing regulations that are not
supported by current data and would stifle the incorporation of new
safety technologies, such as a two-person crew mandate; and

environmental regulations do not function to inhibit the
expansion, development, or construction of rail facilities that would
meet supply chain needs and our customers' freight transportation
demand. These regulations should still allow for careful, thorough
consideration of the environmental impacts of proposed projects but in
a time-limited manner that does not cause unnecessary delay. Railroads
appreciate that Congress included project permitting provisions in the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, such as One Federal Decision,
which consolidates decision-making and expedites deadlines, and the
Federal Permitting Reform and Jobs Act, which makes the Federal
Permitting Improvement Steering Council permanent and establishes a
goal of two years for reviews.

Questions from Hon. Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon to Ian Jefferies,
President and Chief Executive Officer, Association of American
Railroads

Question 1. Mr. Jefferies, according to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the Texas Transportation Institute's 2019 Urban
Mobility Report, it's reported that trucks waste 3.3 billion gallons of
fuel annually due to highway congestion resulting in moving freight by
rail being on average 3 to 4 times more fuel efficient than trucks.
On top of new, more efficient locomotives and anti-idling
technologies, how can the infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
funding be leveraged to utilize the most efficient modes of
transportation to move freight while reducing greenhouse gasses in and
out of ports?
Answer. Railroads have invested more than $740 billion of private
capital into improving and maintaining their networks since 1980--$25
billion annually in recent years. These investments will ensure that
adequate freight rail capacity exists to meet America's current and
future freight transportation needs, and the American Society of Civil
Engineers has recognized the importance of these investments by
awarding rail the highest grade of all American infrastructure in its
last two report cards. During recent supply chain challenges and
fluctuating demand associated with the pandemic, these investments
helped railroads to successfully meet the needs of American businesses
and consumers and move unprecedented amounts of intermodal freight
during the last 3 months of 2020 and the first 6 of 2021. These
investments will also allow for railroads to remain nimble in the
future, and railroads today have additional capacity to handle even
more traffic.
Railroads thank Congress for enacting the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act (IIJA). This bipartisan legislation will modernize the
nation's public infrastructure and further the efficiency of our
freight transportation systems and supply chains. By authorizing and
making significant investments through the Infrastructure for
Rebuilding America (INFRA), Rebuilding American Infrastructure with
Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) (Local and Regional Project
Assistance), National Infrastructure Project Assistance, Port
Infrastructure Development, Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety
Improvements (CRISI), and Railroad Crossing Elimination grant programs,
projects will be constructed that increase the fluidity of our supply
chains, such as improving first and last mile intermodal connections;
advancing projects of national and regional significance, including
multimodal connection infrastructure projects; and enabling the public
sector to partner with industry on mutually beneficial projects, such
as the CREATE program in Chicago.
Furthermore, IIJA also includes a number of programs focused on the
development and demonstration of alternative fuels and transportation
technologies, including the Industrial Emissions Demonstration Projects
program, Clean Hydrogen Research and Development program, Advanced
Energy Manufacturing and Recycling grant program, Electric Drive
Vehicle Battery Recycling and Second-Life Applications program,
Additional Clean Hydrogen programs, Railroad Research and Development
program, and the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Infrastructure.
These programs include rail-related eligibilities, and AAR looks
forward to partnering with the Departments of Transportation and Energy
to further research and develop technologies that fuel locomotives with
alternatives to traditional diesel fuel and that are essential to
advancing innovation and helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in
transportation.

Question 2. Can we build enough highways to meet demand, or should
shippers better utilize existing freight networks to reduce congestion
on the country's roadways?
Answer. The nation's freight transportation demand was recently
forecasted by the Federal Highway Administration to increase by 37
percent over the next 20 years. Given the expense associated with
highway construction and maintenance, it is not realistic to think that
our nation's interstate highway system can absorb that growing demand.
Railroads have worked diligently to ensure they have sufficient
capacity to meet the nation's current and future growing freight
transportation demand. America's freight rail network is the best in
the world, spanning close to 140,000 route-miles. ``Crumbling'' might
describe some U.S. infrastructure, but not freight rail. As previously
noted, the American Society of Civil Engineers has recognized this and
awarded rail the highest grade of all American infrastructure in its
last two report cards. Freight rail infrastructure is in better overall
condition today than ever before. Additionally, because a single train
can replace several hundred trucks, utilizing railroads reduces highway
gridlock and the demand on tax dollars to repair our nation's roads and
bridges.
Without railroads, it would be significantly more expensive for
American firms and consumers to participate in the global economy. The
affordability of freight rail saves rail customers billions of dollars
each year, enhances the global competitiveness of U.S. products, and
helps American consumers. Average rail rates (measured by inflation-
adjusted revenue per ton-mile) were 44 percent lower in 2020 than in
1981. Millions of Americans work in industries that are more
competitive in the tough global economy thanks to the affordability and
productivity of America's freight railroads.

Question 3. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, the
last surface bill that was enacted prior to the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act, which was just signed this week, contained a
section on Port Metrics to help reduce areas of bottlenecks.
Currently the Bureau of Transportation Statistics reports monthly
on the number of 20-foot equivalents at the Nation's 10 largest ports.
However, this reporting does not give any information on the efficiency
of the port itself.
It does not tell us whether or not labor is moving as efficiently
as it could day over day, it doesn't tell us if there are issues with
scales and gate times, it doesn't tell us if trucks are waiting longer
than normal or if there aren't any berths available, it doesn't tell us
how many crane lifts occur. These are all factors that affect port
efficiency.
a.  Mr. Jefferies--do you think similar information on loading
times for rail would also be beneficial to scheduling rail operations?
b.  What additional information are we missing from ports activity
reporting that would help shippers and carriers be able to make the
most informed decisions to help reduce bottlenecks and improve
efficiencies?
Answer. Railroads serving ports are in regular, often daily,
contact with port administrators, steamship lines, drayage companies,
and warehousing operators on or near port facilities. Railroads have
complex information and data collection systems that already provide
the information needed to identify issues and operate efficiently.
Requiring railroads and other supply chain partners to substantially
change their systems could result in widespread operational problems.
Railroads understand that effective data sharing is crucial to
well-functioning rail networks and supply chains. To that end,
railroads already make available a variety of online tools, apps, and
other technologies that provide their customers and representatives
with visibility regarding their shipments' journeys over rail networks.
For example, these tools provide rail customers on many railroads the
ability to trace individual shipments in real time and let customers
know when containers have been removed from railcars and are ready to
be picked up, where those individual containers are located within rail
facilities, and how long containers have been sitting after the
customer has been notified. These tools allow rail customers to more
efficiently prioritize retrieval of containers and minimize time spent
in rail facilities. Railroads also provide network and facility
updates, service advisories, and maintenance overviews to customers.
All of these efforts help to ensure the efficient movement of goods on
the network.
Finally, AAR publicly releases aggregated data on a weekly basis
about the commodities and intermodal volume that move by rail
throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This publication
includes detailed information at the commodity level and provides
needed insight into rail traffic levels for supply chain partners, rail
customers, and governmental entities.

Question from Hon. Andre Carson to Ian Jefferies, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Association of American Railroads

Question 1. Role of Rail (and Blocked Crossings)--After seeing so
much congestion at ports, I'd like to get your thoughts on what
positive role rail might play in strengthening our supply chain? Not
just in terms of more efficient movement of goods and materials, but
improving our human infrastructure too. Precision railroading sounds
impressive, but it just seems counter-intuitive to plan for longer
trains but smaller crew size. Our transportation systems are only as
strong as our people, our workers. And in a place like Indiana, the
Crossroads of America, we must also address the congestion on the roads
that unfortunately results when downtown and critical streets are
blocked by painfully long freight trains. How can these disruptions be
improved as we're working to strengthen our supply chains?
Answer. Railroad operational teams work closely with community
leaders, government partners, first responders, and the public to
manage and mitigate the impact of grade crossings. The causes of
occupied crossings are numerous and can span from unplanned events,
such as weather-related track blockages or the presence of trespassers
near rail tracks, to those associated with rail operations, such as
temporary blockages as railcars are dropped off or picked up at a rail
customer facility or safety tests or crew changes are performed as
required by regulation.
By listening to feedback from communities--and working directly
with first responders--railroads identify and determine how best to
manage certain crossings. At every crossing, there is a sign posted
containing an emergency phone number and an identification number so
callers can immediately communicate issues with the railroads.
Additionally, railroads are partnering with technology companies to
develop digital signs that let the public know when a train is
occupying a crossing so they can choose another route in advance.
There is no one-size-fits-all approach to managing the more than
200,000 grade crossings nationwide. Railroad operational teams deploy a
range of strategies, depending on the circumstances, to minimize the
frequency of occupied crossings and keep rail and vehicle traffic
safely moving through these intersections, including modifying train
and crew work schedules and railcar-switching practices and operations
and extending and constructing new sidings.
Railroads also spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year to
maintain crossings and enhance sidings, develop public service
campaigns and educational resources addressing grade crossing safety,
and invest in new technologies. Ultimately, the most effective way to
prevent crossing impacts is to reduce the number of crossings along the
rail network. Railroads work with local road authorities, private
property owners, and the U.S. Department of Transportation to identify
crossings that can be consolidated, upgraded, or closed. Furthermore,
as business and residential development continues, railroads work with
local planning authorities to help carefully plan new infrastructure
developments to limit community interaction with railroad activities
while allowing the continued operation of the railroad corridor.
Additionally, railroads partner with local and state governments to
improve alternate access for roadway users, such as new grade
separations.
Railroads applaud Congress for providing a total of $845 million
per year through the Section 130 and Railroad Crossing Elimination
programs for projects to eliminate hazards at grade crossings in the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Additionally, railroads thank
Congress for including needed reforms to the Section 130 program, such
as enabling replacement of functionally obsolete warning devices and
increasing permissible incentive payment amounts for closing crossings.
These changes and funding levels will be impactful for undertaking
important grade crossing safety and improvement projects.

Question from Hon. Stephen F. Lynch to Ian Jefferies, President and
Chief Executive Officer, Association of American Railroads

Question 1. While ports are a cornerstone of the U.S. economy,
outdated infrastructure and the COVID-19 pandemic have strained their
capacity and jeopardized global supply chains. According to the 2021
Report Card for America's Infrastructure Report issued by the American
Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), in 2018, America's ports supported
more than 30 million jobs and approximately 26% of our nation's GDP.
Federal, State and Local governments have invested millions of dollars
in our regional ports to serve the global shipping industry. However,
the ASCE report card warns that ports face extensive challenges
modernizing infrastructure and maintaining essential facilities under
threat from sea level rise and other climate challenges.
a.  What are you doing to push the industry to utilize these
regional gateways to address the supply congestion at the nation's
largest ports?
Answer. The interplay of many different factors determine which
ports and routes are used for supply chains. These factors include:
time sensitivity of the freight being carried; inventory carrying
costs; capital costs of new vessels; fuel costs; time in transit; port
fees; inland transportation costs; the speed by which containers are
able to be moved inland; environmental considerations; efficiency of
port operations; and availability of warehouse space. Taken together,
these factors determine which ports offer shippers the best value.
Ultimately though, railroads do not decide which port a steamship will
use; rather railroads strive to offer safe, efficient, cost-effective
service regardless of the port chosen.

Question from Hon. Sharice Davids to Ian Jefferies, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Association of American Railroads

Question 1. I also want to think ahead, because current supply
chain issues are, of course, complicated by pent-up demand and other
pandemic factors. I've heard the supply chain problems we're
experiencing now described as a chain of dominoes falling into each
other. But I think there's an opportunity here to boost American
industry and labor while combating rising costs long-term.
We've been dependent on materials made in other countries for far
too long, and I think it's important that we use this as an opportunity
to invest in our economy, supply chains, and workforce, so we can lower
costs for working folks and avoid this supply chain crunch happening
again in the future.
We cannot just reset our dominoes--we need to stop the chain
reaction before it even begins.
An example would be the strong Buy America provisions in the
infrastructure bill we just passed, or continuing to boost
semiconductor and other critical material manufacturing here at home.
What policies do you see as critical to help businesses and
workforce ensure that our supply chain both recovers now--and is
prepared to address future issues and cost pressures?
Answer. Congress should first and foremost be commended for
enacting the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). This
bipartisan legislation will modernize the nation's public
infrastructure and further the efficiency of our freight transportation
systems and supply chains. By authorizing and making significant
investments through the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA),
Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity
(RAISE) (Local and Regional Project Assistance), National
Infrastructure Project Assistance, Port Infrastructure Development,
Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI), and
Railroad Crossing Elimination grant programs, projects will be
constructed that increase the fluidity of our supply chains, such as
improving first and last mile intermodal connections; advancing
projects of national and regional significance, including multimodal
connection infrastructure projects; and enabling the public sector to
partner with industry on mutually beneficial projects, such as the
CREATE program in Chicago.
Policymakers can further assist in resolving our nation's supply
chain challenges by removing impediments to effective solutions and
encouraging the use of innovative technologies to enhance safety and
operational effectiveness. Congress should work to ensure:

the STB maintains a balanced economic regulatory system
and rejects unwise rail regulations, such as forced switching;

the FRA incorporates a performance-based regulatory
framework and fosters innovation and testing of emerging technologies
that improve the safety and efficiency of rail operations, such as
automated track inspection;

the FRA avoids imposing regulations that are not
supported by current data and would stifle the incorporation of new
safety technologies, such as a two-person crew mandate; and

environmental regulations do not function to inhibit the
expansion, development, or construction of rail facilities that would
meet supply chain needs and our customers' freight transportation
demand. These regulations should still allow for careful, thorough
consideration of the environmental impacts of proposed projects but in
a time-limited manner that does not cause unnecessary delay. Railroads
appreciate that Congress included project permitting provisions in the
IIJA, such as One Federal Decision, which consolidates decision-making
and expedites deadlines, and the Federal Permitting Reform and Jobs
Act, which makes the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council
permanent and establishes a goal of two years for reviews.

Finally, policymakers should restore the Highway Trust Fund (HTF)
to a user-pays system. The United States has historically relied upon a
user-pays system to fund investments in public road and bridge
infrastructure. Unfortunately, revenues into the HTF have failed to
keep pace with investment needs, requiring general fund transfers of
$275 billion to cover the shortfall through FY 2026. General fund
transfers to the HTF distort the freight transportation market in favor
of the commercial trucking industry and put other modes, including
railroads, at a competitive disadvantage. This is especially
problematic for railroads which build, maintain, and pay for their own
private infrastructure. Railroads commend Congress though for including
in IIJA both a highway cost allocation study, which will help Congress
better ensure different highway users, including commercial motor
vehicles, cover their fair share of costs to maintain our nation's
roads and bridges, as well as a national motor vehicle per-mile user
fee pilot. Both of these programs will be essential to restoring and
maintaining the long-term solvency of the Highway Trust Fund. Until
commercial trucks pay the full cost of the damage they cause to our
roads and bridges, policymakers should also reject calls to increase
federal truck size and weight limits.

Questions from Hon. Seth Moulton to Ian Jefferies, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Association of American Railroads

Question 1. Mr. Jefferies, the railroads have faced significant
challenges this year, many outside of their control. We have certainly
seen them adapt to help ease the current supply chain disruptions.
During this time, how have the Class I railroads adapted their
operating models to meet current conditions? What has been successful?
Answer. Freight supply chains are complex systems driven by global
and domestic stakeholders. While operations are constantly facing
pressures, unprecedented events have arisen in the past 18 months that
have led to significant supply chain dislocations. America's freight
railroads are doing their part though--through significant investments
in their private infrastructure and equipment, development and
implementation of innovative technologies, cooperation with their
customers and supply chain partners, and operational enhancements--to
ensure that supply chains remain fluid and that they are able to meet
present and future freight transportation demand.
First, railroads have and will continue to operate 24/7 and would
welcome freight transportation customers and other supply chain
partners to do the same. Substantial supply chain capacity could be
generated immediately from this change, and this would permit
transportation providers to ``catch up'' when backups occur. Railroads
appreciate that some supply chain participants have recently taken
steps in this direction.
Second, railroads are collaborating with their customers and other
supply chain partners to find constructive ways to modify their
operations and maintain network fluidity. Some of these changes
include:

Increasing coordination between railroads to better
manage the flow of traffic and with the trucking industry to take
shipments as soon as warehousing capacity is available;

Offering incentives to customers for weekend or off-hour
in-gating at facilities near ports and for out-gating a container when
they in-gate a container at other facilities;

Re-routing traffic away from busier terminals to less
crowded terminals;

Reopening closed terminals to create additional storage
capacity;

Increasing available storage capacity and staging space
in and outside of terminals;

Creating additional railroad-to-railroad interchanges to
limit demand on truck drayage; and

Mounting containers onto any chassis brought in to help
reduce dead-miles for truckers.

Third, railroads typically make available a variety of online
tools, apps, and other technologies that provide their customers with
full visibility regarding shipments' journeys over rail networks. This
allows for customers to trace shipments in real time, more efficiently
prioritize retrieval of containers, and minimize time spent in rail
facilities.
Fourth, railroads can incentivize customers to pick up freight in a
timely manner through charging progressively higher storage fees after
a reasonable initial period of ``free time.'' These fees help railroads
maintain service reliability, efficient use of rail capacity and
assets, and fluidity on the rail network. And ultimately storage fees
function to ensure railroads can do what they are in business to do--
move goods.
Finally, thanks to consistent private investments in infrastructure
and equipment and technology and operational enhancements, railroads
are confident they have the people, equipment, and capacity to manage
the network at current and increased traffic levels, serve their
customers' needs, and help the nation's economy recover from the
pandemic and current supply chain disruptions. Railroads are also
recalling workers who were furloughed during the pandemic, hiring new
train operating employees in key markets to handle increased and
unpredictable shipping demand, and providing bonuses to workers who
provide new hire referrals.
The successes of these practices were shown in a report recently
released by the Northwestern University Transportation Center which
found that railroads showed significant agility to respond during rises
in intermodal traffic throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

Question 2. Mr. Jefferies, nearly all of the Class I railroads
deploy Precision Schedule Railroading. Has Precision Scheduled
Railroading contributed to the effects we feel today from supply chain
disruptions, labor shortages, and increased e-commerce?
Answer. The term ``precision scheduled railroading'' does not have
a one-size-fits-all meaning. Each railroad has its own unique service
area, customers, and challenges that demand their own operational
plans. Generally speaking, however, the goal is to improve asset
utilization and productivity in the safest, most efficient manner and
deliver a better customer experience through more reliable operations.
By continually re-examining and focusing on improving their
operating practices, railroads have created a more resilient rail
network that is better able to adapt to market changes. While no one
could have predicted the last two years, the decisions and investments
made by railroads have helped them to remain nimble in the face of
supply chain challenges and meet wildly fluctuating demand. In the last
3 months of 2020 and the first 6 of 2021, railroads successfully moved
unprecedented amounts of intermodal freight. During this time,
railroads were handling close to 300,000 containers and trailers per
week, levels that no one expected when the pandemic began.
Additionally, the success of these operational plans is shown in that
railroads today have capacity to handle even more traffic.

Question 3. Mr. Jefferies, one challenge in our supply chain is the
availability of truck drivers. What role could our railroads play in
moving more freight if the decreased supply of truck drivers persists?
What would it take to achieve a modal shift that, for instance, reduces
the demand for long-haul trucking?
Answer. The freight transportation market in the United States
today is intensely competitive. Railroads know they must continue to
earn their customers' business and are constantly working to further
increase productivity, reduce costs, invest in their networks, and
improve service. For railroads, furthering the industry's
competitiveness takes many forms, including:

Maintaining a focus on safety. The past decade has been
the safest in rail history, and railroads continue to work diligently
to identify new technologies, operational enhancements, trainings, and
other ways to further improve their safety record.

Recognizing capacity is key. The U.S. freight rail
network is in its best condition ever. Railroads have invested more
than $740 billion in capital expenditures and maintenance on their
networks since 1980--$25 billion annually in recent years. These
investments will help ensure our nation's freight rail infrastructure
remains world-class and that adequate freight rail capacity exists to
meet America's current and future freight transportation needs. As
previously mentioned, the decisions and investments made by railroads
have helped them to remain nimble in the face of supply chain
challenges and meet wildly fluctuating demand. In the last 3 months of
2020 and the first 6 of 2021, railroads successfully moved
unprecedented amounts of intermodal freight. Additionally, railroads
today have capacity to handle even more traffic.

Focusing on customer service. Railroads know their
customers face intensely competitive global markets that increasingly
demand faster, more reliable, and cost-effective service. In response,
railroads are continually launching new customer service initiatives
and working with rail suppliers, trucking companies, and other
businesses to improve their service.

Enhancing sustainability and addressing climate change.
Freight rail is well ahead of other modes of transportation when it
comes to limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Freight railroads today
account for only 1.9 percent of the transportation-related greenhouse
gas emissions, while accounting for 40 percent or more of long-distance
freight volume. U.S. railroads, on average can move 1 ton of freight
over 480 miles on a single gallon of gas, and moving freight by train
instead of truck reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 75 percent.
Today's railroads are partnering with the Departments of Transportation
and Energy to further research and development into technologies that
fuel locomotives with alternatives to traditional diesel fuel and will
continue to leverage technology and modernize operations to that
further increase fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions
associated with their operations.

Policymakers can help ensure railroads are able to meet current and
future growing freight transportation demand by rejecting harmful
policies and encouraging the use of innovative technologies to enhance
safety and efficiency. Congress should work to ensure:

the STB maintains a balanced economic regulatory system
and rejects unwise rail regulations, such as forced switching;

the FRA incorporates a performance-based regulatory
framework and fosters innovation and testing of emerging technologies
that improve the safety and efficiency of rail operations, such as
automated track inspection;

the FRA avoids imposing regulations that are not
supported by current data and would stifle the adoption of new
technologies, such as a two-person crew mandate; and

environmental regulations do not function to inhibit the
expansion, development, or construction of rail facilities that would
meet supply chain needs and our customers' freight transportation
demand. These regulations should still allow for careful, thorough
consideration of the environmental impacts of proposed projects but in
a time-limited manner that does not cause unnecessary delay. Railroads
appreciate that Congress included project permitting provisions in the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), such as One Federal
Decision, which consolidates decision-making and expedites deadlines,
and the Federal Permitting Reform and Jobs Act, which makes the Federal
Permitting Improvement Steering Council permanent and establishes a
goal of two years for reviews.

Finally, policymakers should restore the Highway Trust Fund (HTF)
to a user-pays system. The United States has historically relied upon a
user-pays system to fund investments in public road and bridge
infrastructure. Unfortunately, revenues into the HTF have failed to
keep pace with investment needs, requiring general fund transfers of
$275 billion to cover the shortfall through FY 2026. General fund
transfers to the HTF distort the freight transportation market in favor
of the commercial trucking industry and put other modes, including
railroads, at a competitive disadvantage. This is especially
problematic for railroads which build, maintain, and pay for their own
private infrastructure. Railroads commend Congress though for including
in IIJA both a highway cost allocation study, which will help Congress
better ensure different highway users, including commercial motor
vehicles, cover their fair share of costs to maintain our nation's
roads and bridges, as well as a national motor vehicle per-mile user
fee pilot. Both of these programs will be essential to restoring and
maintaining the long-term solvency of the Highway Trust Fund. Until
commercial trucks pay the full cost of the damage they cause to our
roads and bridges, policymakers should also reject calls to increase
federal truck size and weight limits.

Question 4. Mr. Jefferies, there is an example of this modal shift
right now. As you know, Union Pacific has partnered with the port
authorities of California and Utah to move more freight destined for
the intermountain west by rail. Are there larger lessons we can draw
from this example with regard to how we might use the funding in the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to strengthen our supply chain?
Are there particular infrastructure investments, perhaps in ports or
railyards, that would be needed to increase the volume of freight moved
by rail in the U.S.?
Answer. Policymakers can help to strengthen supply chains by
implementing programs that improve first and last mile connections
where freight is handed off from one mode to another--for example, at
ports from ships to railroads or trucks, or from railroads to trucks at
intermodal terminals. Improving these connections would lead to
especially large increases in efficiency and fluidity and forge a
stronger, more effective total transportation system.
Thankfully, Congress has already enacted IIJA which authorizes and
provides significant funding for the Infrastructure for Rebuilding
America (INFRA), Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability
and Equity (RAISE) (Local and Regional Project Assistance), National
Infrastructure Project Assistance, Port Infrastructure Development,
Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI), and
Railroad Crossing Elimination grant programs. The projects awarded
grants under these programs will modernize the nation's public
infrastructure and further the efficiency of our freight transportation
systems and supply chains, including through improving first and last
mile intermodal connections; advancing projects of national and
regional significance, such as multimodal connection infrastructure
projects; and enabling the public sector to partner with industry on
mutually beneficial projects, such as the CREATE program in Chicago.

Question from Hon. Peter A. DeFazio to Anne Reinke, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Transportation Intermediaries Association

Question 1. Who is responsible for correcting our supply chain
challenges?
Answer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman for the question, ultimately, I
think everyone involved in the supply chain has a role to play in
alleviating the supply chain crisis. Each player plays an integral role
in making sure that products are moving safely and efficiently
throughout the supply chain. As we discussed at the hearing, this is
not the problem of one single issue or party, but a perfect storm of
conditions and shortage of several key areas caused directly by a
global pandemic. As I mentioned in my opening statement, we can correct
the congestion in the supply chain through the three ``I''s:
investment, innovation and interaction among the supply chain
stakeholders. We all have a role to play, from federal and state
government (deploying investment through the ``BIF'' and encouraging
investment through right-sized regulatory regimes), industry and labor.
The only way to get through this crisis is to work together in
collaboration to alleviate issues in the supply chain. You are seeing
that today and we believe the light at the end of the tunnel is ahead
of us.

Question from Hon. Sam Graves to Anne Reinke, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Transportation Intermediaries Association

Question 1. Ms. Reinke, can you elaborate on the current conditions
of detention time and how brokers handle these delays?
Answer. In December 2017, with the implementation of the Electronic
Logging Device (ELD) mandate by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration (FMCSA), in an instant, time leapfrogged mileage for
rate valuations. Shippers and 3PLs began buying the driver's time, not
the mileage. The industry continues to move in this direction now that
the ELDs are tracking the drivers' hours-of-service (HOS) by the minute
and capturing excess time they spend on loading and unloading. Although
carriers and logistics companies' providers have the technology and
data to capture and bill their customers for detention, preventing it
altogether is a more desirable outcome by having 3PLs work with
shippers to set realistic and accurate appointment times.
One of the most utilized technologies to track detention time is
geofencing, which is a common method to automatically record arrival
and departure times to identify detention events for billing.
Geofencing is a mobile feature and back-office management system to
create a virtual perimeter around a location to detect assets crossing
certain boundaries.
Furthermore, a lot of shippers will require their brokers and
carriers to utilize freight visibility platforms and will not pay
detention charges to the broker or carrier unless there is an exchange
of data via these platforms.
When truck capacity was tight in 2018, motor carriers and 3PLs were
able to be more selective of the customers they worked with. Some were
focused on building scorecards to measure and rank their customers to
create the best network and book of business. TIA members work with
shippers regularly to make sure carriers are paid for the time they are
delayed. TIA wants our members and our members' customers to be brokers
and shippers of choice.

Question from Hon. Andre Carson to Anne Reinke, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Transportation Intermediaries Association

Question 1. Role of Rail (and Blocked Crossings)--After seeing so
much congestion at ports, I'd like to get your thoughts on what
positive role rail might play in strengthening our supply chain? Not
just in terms of more efficient movement of goods and materials, but
improving our human infrastructure too. Precision railroading sounds
impressive, but it just seems counter-intuitive to plan for longer
trains but smaller crew size. Our transportation systems are only as
strong as our people, our workers. And in a place like Indiana, the
Crossroads of America, we must also address the congestion on the roads
that unfortunately results when downtown and critical streets are
blocked by painfully long freight trains. How can these disruptions be
improved as we're working to strengthen our supply chains?
Answer. Congressman Carson, as you note, freight rail is an
essential and critical part of the supply chain; using rail can
mitigate road congestion and remove backlogs from ports. The freight
railroads have seen enormous demand, and consequently, considerable
disruption during the pandemic. As a result, it is critically important
to their success to have a regulatory environment that encourages
investment; without their private investment in their infrastructure,
the supply chain writ large suffers. As you also note, the freight rail
industry has adopted an operational model of ``Precision Scheduled
Railroading'' that emphasizes longer trains and fewer stops. The number
of crewmen has not changed in several decades; should it do so, the
matter will likely be determined through collective bargaining. Longer
trains can block crossings and impact communities if the train
operations are congested or there is a disruption to the system. The
railroads and the communities should have an open dialogue to resolve
these issues and the railroads should commit to doing whatever they can
to keep the trains moving.

Question from Hon. Michelle Steel to Anne Reinke, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Transportation Intermediaries Association

Question 1. Can you enumerate and share further details of some of
the challenges in ocean shipping that your members (and/or their
customers) have experienced during the current disruption, that would
be addressed/alleviated by elements of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of
2021?
Answer. Thank you, Congresswoman Steel for the question. It's a
fair question, our members and indirectly their customers have felt
extended times for final delivery of freight. This is happening a lot
of the time at the port to warehouse sector of the supply chain.
Whether it be bottlenecks, traffic conditions, or labor shortages, our
ports are not running at their peak efficiency. This is very
frustrating for both the carrier on-site, the broker working behind the
scenes, and our customer who is feeling the pressure from the entity
that is expecting freight quickly and smoothly.
TIA is proud to support the efforts of Congressmen Garamendi and
Johnson in their efforts to get our supply chain back to full
effectiveness. Our members have felt firsthand the outrageous demurrage
and detention fees that all too often appear as revenue generators, not
an incentivizing method to help keep freight and containers moving. The
legislation would direct FMC to determine what unreasonable Demurrage
and Detention fees are setting a standard for these tactics.
Secondly, our members work closely with carriers of all types and
modes like air freight, rail, highway CMV's and ocean carriers. Because
there are such few ocean carriers available to move freight, they have
gained a lot of market control of the mobility and movement of freight.
By further banning retaliatory practices of ocean carriers against
shippers Congress is effectively evening the playing field and allowing
a shipper who has every right to file a complaint to continue to
effectively move their product.
Lastly, the legislation would add two new stakeholders that are
eligible to join the National Shipper Advisory Committee, Customs
Brokers and Freight Forwarders.

Question from Hon. Stephen F. Lynch to Anne Reinke, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Transportation Intermediaries Association

Question 1. While ports are a cornerstone of the U.S. economy,
outdated infrastructure and the COVID-19 pandemic have strained their
capacity and jeopardized global supply chains. According to the 2021
Report Card for America's Infrastructure Report issued by the American
Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), in 2018, America's ports supported
more than 30 million jobs and approximately 26% of our nation's GDP.
Federal, State and Local governments have invested millions of dollars
in our regional ports to serve the global shipping industry. However,
the ASCE report card warns that ports face extensive challenges
modernizing infrastructure and maintaining essential facilities under
threat from sea level rise and other climate challenges.
a.  What are you doing to push the industry to utilize these
regional gateways to address the supply congestion at the nation's
largest ports?
Answer. Thank you, Congressman Lynch, for the excellent question.
Essentially as the travel agents of freight in the supply chain, our
members utilize the latest technology advances to efficiently move
freight throughout the supply chain. A part of this is to work with the
ports to ensure that the latest technological advances are implemented,
including freight visibility platforms, so that all parties have real-
time visibility of where the freight is. I think TIA would agree with
you that the U.S. ports are far behind other nations, but as we know
the U.S. is the greatest nation in the world and will overcome these
challenges to ensure that our infrastructure including ports is world
class. TIA members also work with the ports to ensure the latest
technology and automation is utilized and implemented. As the brokerage
industry continues to advance through technology, our ports must
continue to meet those needs by advancing as well. In terms of
utilizing local ports and redirecting, this can be tricky, but our
members are a pragmatic group of business leaders and always looking
ways to alleviate the crisis where necessary and utilizing local ports
instead of LA-Long Beach has been an option. I was speaking with a
member recently who indicated that they redirected a ship from LA-Long
Beach to Norfolk, VA and trucked the load back to Washington State its
end destination.

Questions from Hon. Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon to Anne Reinke, President
and Chief Executive Officer, Transportation Intermediaries Association

Question 1. Ms. Reinke, I have raised the issue of port metrics
with Mr. Jefferies and Mr. Spear, however, I'd like to get your
viewpoint on how getting real-time port metrics can help your industry
schedule accordingly to make the whole system be as efficient as
possible.
In your testimony you said brokers can utilize their relationships,
but what if they could also utilize technology from real-time reporting
from ports? What if they knew there was a chassis shortage at the Port
of Los Angeles but a surplus as the Port of Long Beach, or if Seattle
Tacoma had berths available with a rail connection south, while
California ports were experiencing a backlog? Could this information be
helpful for your clients making better business choices and to help
alleviate bottlenecks in the transportation network?
Question 2. Ms. Reinke, do you think we'd be in the position we are
in today with the port backlogs and bottlenecks if we would have a
real-time data and automation?
a.  How do we get labor involved in the process to ensure they are
willing participants? Labor is a critical component to a working port,
however, if they're not operating at an efficient level, should we look
to automation?
b.  Would it be beneficial to have a case study for automation at a
port of a decent size, such as the Port of San Juan?
Answers to questions 1, 2, 2.a., & 2.b.. Thank you, Representative
Gonzalez-Colon, TIA is happy to report that there are already
technology solutions being utilized in the supply chain and at ports
that can give all stakeholders visibility in real-time to the status of
the freight. TIA has several members in the supply chain that offer
these solutions for brokers, shippers and carriers. The issue is
adoption from all parties involved. As you keenly pointed out labor is
a major issue and one of the top issues in the supply chain right now,
as the nation has a serious labor shortage throughout the supply chain.
At TIA we agree that automation might be an answer to this shortage, as
our members have over the last 15 years or so began automating the
entire logistics and freight brokerage industry. This would include
sourcing a load, to freight visibility, and the payment of the end
carrier. From our Association's perspective technology is the litmus
test for those entities that will continue to innovate and prosper and
those that will not. A case study of a port, like that of the one in
San Juan, would have huge benefits to get a sense of where we as a
nation currently stand. As the brokerage industry continues to advance
through technology, our ports must continue to meet those needs by
advancing as well. In discussing with ports many of them are already in
the process of this and looking to take that next step in terms of
automation. I think the future is bright in this aspect.

Question from Hon. Sharice Davids to Anne Reinke, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Transportation Intermediaries Association

Question 1. I also want to think ahead, because current supply
chain issues are, of course, complicated by pent-up demand and other
pandemic factors. I've heard the supply chain problems we're
experiencing now described as a chain of dominoes falling into each
other. But I think there's an opportunity here to boost American
industry and labor while combating rising costs long-term.
We've been dependent on materials made in other countries for far
too long, and I think it's important that we use this as an opportunity
to invest in our economy, supply chains, and workforce, so we can lower
costs for working folks and avoid this supply chain crunch happening
again in the future.
We cannot just reset our dominoes--we need to stop the chain
reaction before it even begins.
An example would be the strong Buy America provisions in the
infrastructure bill we just passed, or continuing to boost
semiconductor and other critical material manufacturing here at home.
What policies do you see as critical to help businesses and
workforce ensure that our supply chain both recovers now--and is
prepared to address future issues and cost pressures?
Answer. Congresswoman Davids, thank you for the thoughtful
question. From TIA's perspective, I would like to focus on two topics:
industry collaboration and technology. TIA members are the industry
leaders in terms of technology and are constantly developing and
implementing the latest cutting edge technology products. We as a
nation need to continue to allow these companies to innovate and
advance and enhance our nation's infrastructure projects and needs.
This includes adopting policies that give companies the freedom to
innovate if it is not at the expense of safety. Secondly, I would look
at industry collaboration: all the industry stakeholders in the supply
chain work hard and each of them play an integral role in moving goods
throughout the supply chain. There are several policies areas that many
industry stakeholders agree (for example, expanding truck parking) and
Congress needs to work with all stakeholders to find areas of common
support and to work to advance those initiatives. Lastly, we believe
that the motor carrier selection standard legislation is critical to
enhance safety and amplify capacity. Thank you, Congresswoman for your
support for the legislation last year. As you saw in the legislation,
with no federal selection standard and 90% of carriers unrated.
Resolving this issue will ensure that the safest carriers, regardless
of size, are rated and are eligible for selection. We hope you will
support H.R. 3042 in this Congress.

Question from Hon. Peter A. DeFazio to David HC Correll, Ph.D.,
Research Scientist and Lecturer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Center for Transportation and Logistics

Question 1. Who is responsible for correcting our supply chain
challenges?
Answer. I am afraid my research does not lead me to identify any
single actor here. If we start by grouping the relevant actors, I would
propose four very broad groups: (1) end customers; (2) shippers; (3)
carriers and (4) regulators. I would also propose two ways to apportion
responsibility for correcting our supply chain challenges: (A) which
group is most responsible for causing the supply challenges; and (B)
which group is most capable to correct the supply chain challenges?
Starting with responsibility criteria (A) which group is most
responsible for causing the supply chain challenges: I think groups one
through four have all contributed to the problem. My own data and
analysis does not allow me to measure the comparative scale of each
group's causation and therefore assign greatest responsibility. The
focus of my own research zooms in narrowly on the role that shippers
play in detaining truck drivers and thereby reducing their utilization.
I do believe that this is a real problem; but I don't think it is what
caused our current supply chain challenges. In fact, the problem of
long detention time, sadly, long precedes our current supply chain
challenges. I believe that the issue of truck driver detention
exacerbates our current supply chain challenges, but cannot be said to
have caused them. Moving on to responsibility criteria (B) which group
is most capable to correct the supply chain challenges; I think that
each of the four groups has a role to play. While my own research
efforts identify how shippers could make better use of truck drivers
time, I similarly hesitate to say that fixing this is the highest
priority when addressing our supply chain challenges.
I apologize for my wishy-washy answer here; but I want to be fully
honest to the truth as I see it and admit to what I do not know. I
think everyone in my four groups has a role to play here. We are all
responsible for doing our part to motivate and enable ourselves, and
each other, to improve this situation.

Questions from Hon. Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon to David HC Correll,
Ph.D., Research Scientist and Lecturer, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Center for Transportation and Logistics

Question 1. Dr. Correll, how can Congress and appropriate agencies
accurately capture data on detention and working conditions for truck
drivers?
a.  Additionally, should Congress want to study these metrics,
which institutions or entities could handle a study to stand up a
portal for this information?
b.  How do we get industry stakeholders from all aspects of the
transportation system involved in the development? How could we
incentivize ports and labor to participate?
Answer. I think the first step is to set up a unique identifier for
what I would call all the ``nodes'' in the American domestic supply
chain. By nodes, I mean all the delivery points (like warehouses,
distribution centers, mixing centers, fulfillment centers, rail yards,
stores, etc.) No such unique identifier currently exists, and this
makes it difficult for trucking companies to compare notes and
measurements of their detention experiences at different facilities. I
believe this is an appropriate job for the federal government because:
(1) it is imperative that the operators of these nodes feel compelled
to register, which only the government could reliably compel; and (2)
data collection must be nationwide, which only the federal government
could compel. This would, in effect, be similar to the unique
identifying system for American employers, the Employer Identification
Number (EIN) system.
Should Congress want to interpret the data collected from these
facilities, I would recommend standing up a Supply Chain Information
Administration within the Department of Transportation, or the
Department of Commerce, similar in nature to the Energy Information
Administration (EIA) that exists within the US Department of Energy.
With a dedicated and properly staffed and equipped team, this new
Supply Chain Information Administration could work similarly to the EIA
to collect and report on the latest trends in America's supply chain
competitiveness. Personally, I worked at the EIA for roughly 2 years
and was proud to be part of its mission to help keep America energy
secure. A newly formed Supply Chain Information Administration could do
similar work with the mission to keep America supply chain competitive.
I think that involvement from ports and labor would come from
making the argument to each side that the new Supply Chain Information
Administration represents an honest broker seeking to provide unbiased
and aggregated data that enables better decision making on both sides.
This would, of course, need to be presented as not only a punishment of
high average truck driver detention times, but also a celebration of
low average truck detention times. I would propose that the new Supply
Chain Information Administration award letter grades based on every
registered supply chain node's average truck detention time. This would
be similar to the sanitation letter grades awarded by State Departments
of Health to restaurants. To my mind, labor's participation follows
naturally as the effort itself shines a spotlight on issues of concern
to them. This would also unlock market solutions to the truck driver
detention and retention problems, as carriers could build Supply Chain
Information Administration letter grades into their pricing models for
servicing different customers.

Question from Hon. Andre Carson to David HC Correll, Ph.D., Research
Scientist and Lecturer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center
for Transportation and Logistics

Question 1. Role of Rail (and Blocked Crossings)--After seeing so
much congestion at ports, I'd like to get your thoughts on what
positive role rail might play in strengthening our supply chain? Not
just in terms of more efficient movement of goods and materials, but
improving our human infrastructure too. Precision railroading sounds
impressive, but it just seems counter-intuitive to plan for longer
trains but smaller crew size. Our transportation systems are only as
strong as our people, our workers. And in a place like Indiana, the
Crossroads of America, we must also address the congestion on the roads
that unfortunately results when downtown and critical streets are
blocked by painfully long freight trains. How can these disruptions be
improved as we're working to strengthen our supply chains?
Answer. I am afraid I have not personally conducted research into
the rail sector, so I cannot offer expert opinion here. However, I do
believe that American rail roads have an important part to play here.
When we think about the choice between moving freight by truck vs
moving freight by rail, we know that rail is often more cost effective,
and also environmentally friendly. These two things were true even
before our current supply chains problems. As we look for ways to
unclog America's freight arteries, these benefits stand in even sharper
relief. However, where rail loses to truck conveyance is in what
academics call `place utility'--that is, a train can only drop off at a
rail yard, but a truck can come right to your door.
To my mind then, integration of rail and truck conveyance--often
referred to as `inter-modal' freight transportation--offers strong
potential and merits further study and perhaps even investment. One of
the things that makes trucking a hard job is leaving one's home and
family for weeks at a time to cross the country. But, trains can make
these same trips with far fewer people per ton-mile. And they can often
do it more cheaply and more sustainably. Harmonized intermodal systems
that make greater use of rail to criss-cross the country, covering the
``middle miles'' of a freight trip by rail, and the ``last miles'' of a
freight trip by truck would, I believe, reduce some of the stress on
our scarce and valuable American truck driver workforce, and thereby
unclog our roads and strengthen our supply chains.

Question from Hon. Stephen F. Lynch to David HC Correll, Ph.D.,
Research Scientist and Lecturer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Center for Transportation and Logistics

Question 1. While ports are a cornerstone of the U.S. economy,
outdated infrastructure and the COVID-19 pandemic have strained their
capacity and jeopardized global supply chains. According to the 2021
Report Card for America's Infrastructure Report issued by the American
Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), in 2018, America's ports supported
more than 30 million jobs and approximately 26% of our nation's GDP.
Federal, State and Local governments have invested millions of dollars
in our regional ports to serve the global shipping industry. However,
the ASCE report card warns that ports face extensive challenges
modernizing infrastructure and maintaining essential facilities under
threat from sea level rise and other climate challenges.
a.  What are you doing to push the industry to utilize these
regional gateways to address the supply congestion at the nation's
largest ports?
Answer. I'm afraid that I am personally doing very little. In my
position as a research scientist, I have very little influence over the
procurement decisions of shippers, or the routing decisions of
carriers. However, I think that perhaps one of the solutions that I've
offered as part of this testimony--investing in data collection at all
of America's supply chain nodes, including the ports--would enable data
collection at the ports, which I believe would be essential to the
important modernization efforts referenced in this question. There is
an old adage, `you can't manage what you can't measure'. From an
academic research perspective, I would be honored to help measure
performance at our American ports.

What policies do you see as critical to help businesses and
workforce ensure that our supply chain both recovers now--and is
prepared to address future issues and cost pressures?
Answer. Thank you for this question. I am especially struck by the
dominoes analogy here. The overall global flow of trade is an issue
outside of my scope of research. However, I see your point that trade
imbalances contribute to some of the log jams we see at our ports,
particularly as regards the imbalance between inbound and outbound
ships and shipping containers. Broadly speaking, efforts to incentivize
the development of domestic production capacity makes sense to me as a
solution here. I must note that the details of its implementation are
outside of my own research experience.
However, to my mind, it is helpful to identify what is, and what is
not, within America's scope of influence of here. I think that
comparatively lower international labor costs, comparatively looser
international environmental regulations, and different countries'
customs/tariffs policies will all almost always continue to incentivize
more globalized supply chains. And these factors are all, perhaps,
outside of America's direct sphere of influence. However, domestic
freight transportation and logistics costs also play an important role
in the cost of producing goods and delivering them to American
customers. And these factors are directly within America's sphere of
influence. If we can make the supply chain and logistics cost of
servicing our American consumers cheaper, I think that we stand our
strongest chance of incentivizing more local and domestic production.
From my perspective, these are the policies that are most important to
building stronger American supply chains.

Questions from Hon. Peter A. DeFazio to Gregory R. Regan, President,
Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO

Question 1. One of the significant issues facing the current supply
chain challenges is whether we have enough staff across the industries
represented here today--at our ports, driving trucks, or maintaining
and operating the railroads. I appreciated your testimony highlighting
that we don't have a shortage of Americans who are ready and willing to
work but that these private companies, who have made considerable
profits, will need to pay their people more, provide safe working
conditions and better benefits. I am very concerned with the number of
employees the railroads have let go over the last couple of years in
order to satisfy Wall Street with the implementation of Precision
Scheduled Railroading to increase their operating ratios and the
detrimental impact that has to rail service. Surprisingly, the
Association of American Railroads testimony didn't reference the
October drop in intermodal rail volumes, the signing bonuses they've
been paying to attract workers, or the compressed training they've
offered for conductors that tragically may have resulted in more than
one employee losing a limb. What is driving the managers of these
railroads to make these decisions?
Answer. These managers are operating railroads with a singular
factor in mind--lowering operating ratios, which are operating expenses
as a percentage of revenue, considered to be the standard metric for
railroad profitability, in order to satisfy their hedge fund investors.
While we strongly support the ability of railroads to turn a profit,
which in turn should lead to job creation and good wages, the Class I
railroads of today have become so myopically focused on producing stock
returns that metrics like safety have become an afterthought.

Question 2. Who is responsible for correcting our supply chain
challenges?
Answer. It is clear that the private sector has a major role to
play in course correction. As we noted in our testimony, it was always
likely that such a dramatic spike in volumes would cause disruptions,
but it is also true that actions taken by the private sector that
reduced flexibility and slack in the supply chain have worsened the
problem. Railroads, trucking companies, and others must examine how
their operating models were incongruent with responsiveness, and make
structural changes to avoid similar circumstances in the future.
There may be also be roles for the federal government to ensure
that such structural changes take place. For example, the
administration has already begun to take steps to address issues of
worker misclassification under labor law that have been used to deny
truck drivers and other the benefits of an employer-employee
relationship. From a rail perspective, we support providing the Surface
Transportation Board with additional tools and authorities. Recently,
Senator Baldwin introduced an amendment to the National Defense
Authorization Act that would direct the STB to develop new standards
concerning the fulfillment of railroad's common carrier obligations,
including the consideration of the reductions in workforce and
infrastructure maintenance on service quality, and we highly support
the adoption of a proposal like this.

Questions from Hon. Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon to Gregory R. Regan,
President, Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO

Question 1. Mr. Regan, is it within Congress' authority to ask
ports that receive Federal funding or are subject to Federal
jurisdiction, transportation stakeholders, and labor unions to report
their productivity at ports?
Answer. Congress currently collects much of this data through the
Port Performance Freight Statistics Program, 49 USC 6314.

Question 2. Mr. Regan, what are the major concerns that a labor
union would use to argue against making productivity metrics available
to the public through a real-time data portal to improve efficiencies
across the whole network and increase transparency?
Answer. In prior Congresses, bad faith efforts to undermine
collective bargaining have masqueraded as purported productivity
metrics. Labor is more than willing to discuss how data improvements
could be deployed to reduce inefficiencies and make the freight network
operate more cohesively, but we will continue to strongly oppose any
effort which attacks collective bargaining rights and the collective
bargaining process.

Question from Hon. Andre Carson to Gregory R. Regan, President,
Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO

Question 1. Role of Rail (and Blocked Crossings)--After seeing so
much congestion at ports, I'd like to get your thoughts on what
positive role rail might play in strengthening our supply chain? Not
just in terms of more efficient movement of goods and materials, but

Crossroads of America, we must also address the congestion on the roads
that unfortunately results when downtown and critical streets are
blocked by painfully long freight trains. How can these disruptions be
improved as we're working to strengthen our supply chains?
Answer. Rail offers boundless opportunities for improving the
nation's supply chains. At its best, rail offers a mode of freight
transportation that is safe, environmentally friendly, and can sustain
thousands of good middle class jobs. As mentioned in our testimony,
ports and harbors across the country are clear about the untapped
potential of greater investment in on-dock rail, as the IIJA provides
for through the Port Infrastructure Development Program.
However, as you correctly note, Precision Scheduled Railroading,
and the use of increasingly longer trains that strangle communities is
not the answer. In order to address disruptions, the FRA must take
action to address many of the safety concerns that PSR presents. The
IIJA also contains a study on the safety issues presented by train
length, and we look forward to those findings an d FRA's response. The
Surface Transportation Board should examine its authorities as an
economic regulator to police bad behavior by the railroads, including
whether or not current Class I operating models are fulfilling
statutory common carrier obligations.

Question from Hon. Stephen F. Lynch to Gregory R. Regan, President,
Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO

Question 1. While ports are a cornerstone of the U.S. economy,
outdated infrastructure and the COVID-19 pandemic have strained their
capacity and jeopardized global supply chains. According to the 2021
Report Card for America's Infrastructure Report issued by the American
Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), in 2018, America's ports supported
more than 30 million jobs and approximately 26% of our nation's GDP.
Federal, State and Local governments have invested millions of dollars

the ASCE report card warns that ports face extensive challenges
modernizing infrastructure and maintaining essential facilities under
threat from sea level rise and other climate challenges.
a.  What are you doing to push the industry to utilize these
regional gateways to address the supply congestion at the nation's
largest ports?
Answer. After years of neglect compared to other federal
transportation expenditures, TTD has long worked in tandem with
industry partners to promote increased federal investment specifically
targeted to our nation's ports and harbors. Since the program was
revitalized with our support, the past two appropriations bills have
contained $230M and $280M under the Port Infrastructure Development
Program, which will be furthered buttressed by historic port
investments in the IIJA. These investments will create increased
throughput and efficiency at ports, particularly though the development
of necessary infrastructure projects like the expansion of on-dock rail
services. TTD also supports the inclusion of a new program in the Build
Back Better package which will fund port projects that reduce air
pollution, greening our ports and combating climate change while
increasing efficiency.
TTD has also supported efforts to make better use of smaller ports
and harbors to decrease congestion at our largest ports. As mentioned
in our testimony, we encourage the further development of ``short sea
shipping'' through the Marine Highway program. Short sea shipping is
the use of commercial vessels for the carriage of commodities along
American's seacoasts and inland waterways, potentially to allow for the
transfer of goods from vessels at large ports, to smaller vessels that
will call at smaller ports and inland harbors. This methods of
transportation can reduce congestion, while creating additional jobs in
the maritime, shipbuilding and longshore sectors. However, the growth
of this sector is somewhat inhibited by the current application of the
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund.
Cargo entering the U.S. through a seaport is subject to the Harbor
Maintenance Tax (HMT). If that same cargo is moved via a commercial
vessel, it is then taxed a second time under the HMT when it arrives at
the next port. However, if that cargo is transported by rail or truck
to another U.S. destination, it avoids a duplicative HMT charge. This
inequitable double taxation creates a significant economic disadvantage
for shippers to use what could be a viable transportation option. In
2020, Representatives Brian Higgins (D-NY) and Mike Kelly (R-PA)
introduced H.R. 5351, which would resolve this issue, and we encourage
Congress to revisit this proposal.

Question from Hon. Sharice Davids to Gregory R. Regan, President,

What policies do you see as critical to help businesses and
workforce ensure that our supply chain both recovers now--and is
prepared to address future issues and cost pressures?
Answer. TTD is strongly supportive of initiatives, including the
Buy America language referenced here, that will allow us to strengthen
domestic supply chains and respond more nimbly in the event of a
crisis. For example, increased domestic manufacture of critical freight
transportation items like chassis can help to avoid shortages like
those that we've experienced over the last few months, and increase our
self-reliance on domestic industry.
In the immediate term, our options to end the ongoing congestion
challenges are limited, though we applaud the efforts that the
administration has taken that have been helpful, including working with
terminal operators to keep ports open and incentivizing off-peak
service, allowing for flexibility in certain unspent federal funds, and
promoting government-wide cooperation. However, many of the changes
that will be required to ensure that we don't continue to end up in
similar crises require structural changes to industries and their
governing rules and regulations. As discussed in our testimony, TTD
believes strongly that additional safety and economic oversight of the
freight railroad industry, including at the Surface Transportation
Board, can result in industries that are more resilient and have
increased long-term viability.

Question from Hon. Seth Moulton to Gregory R. Regan, President,
Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO

Question 1. Mr. Regan, the Transportation Trades Department (TTD)
and other rail unions have raised concerns about Precision Scheduled
Railroading (PSR), including that congestion issues in the supply chain
could strain limited network capacity. Do you believe PSR has impacted
our current supply chain challenges? Can you paint the picture of how
this has unfolded on the ground and provide examples of some of the
freight rail challenges we are facing now that have been exacerbated by
PSR?
Answer. PSR has unequivocally worsened supply chain issues. While
the railroads will claim that they are a ``demand industry'' and that
they have right-sized themselves for this purpose, evidence doesn't
support this. In a just a few years, Class I railroads eliminated a
fifth of the entire workforce. Carriers bragged in their financial
filings about how much of their equipment, including locomotives, they
were able to eliminate or mothball. Any claims of running at full
capacity during the crisis must be viewed through this lens of
intentional diminishment of service and capability. A healthy industry
would have had the slack in its network to respond and to allocate
resources quickly, and in a way that lessened the supply chain crunch.
Railroads have made sure they don't have that ability. While running
lean was good for shareholder returns, it continues to be bad for
nation as a whole.
