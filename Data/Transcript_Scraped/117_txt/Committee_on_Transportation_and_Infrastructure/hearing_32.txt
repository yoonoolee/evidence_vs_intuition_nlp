BACKGROUND

CYBERTHREATS TO U.S. INFRASTRUCTURE

Cyberattacks are a serious and evolving risk that affect
transportation and infrastructure matters across T&I's
jurisdiction. This hearing will focus on the needs of T&I
stakeholders and the gaps in the nation's ability to prevent,
prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyberattacks against
infrastructure.
A common term that has sprung up for use within the
government sector is ``critical infrastructure,'' which
according to Presidential Policy Directive 21, Critical
Infrastructure Security and Resilience, includes 16 sectors
whose systems and networks, whether physical or virtual, ``are
considered so vital to the United States that their
incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect
on security, national economic security, national public health
or safety, or any combination thereof.'' \1\ T&I's jurisdiction
includes five of these sectors, including Transportation
Systems, Government Facilities, Water and Wastewater Systems,
Dams, and Emergency Services.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The nation's critical infrastructure is comprised of both
public and private sector assets.\3\ However, within T&I's
jurisdiction, cybersecurity requirements in the private sector
are mainly voluntary. Like other industries and the federal
government, the transportation sector is facing a critical
shortage of cybersecurity personnel, which has impacted the
ability to protect, detect, and respond to cyberattacks
effectively.\4\ Simple steps regarding basic training,
consistent cybersecurity hygiene, and periodic exercises could
go a long way in protecting America's transportation
infrastructure.\5\ As the technology that enables America's
infrastructure becomes ever more complex and increasingly
integrated, cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities will
continue to multiply.

IMPACT OF CYBERATTACKS

Cyberattacks can result in tremendous financial damage,
destruction of infrastructure assets, and even death. They
impact governments, businesses, and individuals alike and have
been growing in number and sophistication. Late last year, it
was discovered that a Russian-backed cyber campaign had
installed malware in software updates that were received by as
many as 18,000 customers of an American firm, SolarWinds, which
develops software for businesses and governments.\6\ The
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released an updated alert
on the SolarWinds hack in April 2021, warning that DHS
``determined that this threat poses a grave risk to the Federal
Government and state, local, tribal, and territorial
governments as well as critical infrastructure entities and
other private sector organizations.'' \7\

East Coast for nearly one week, causing fuel shortages and
increasing fuel prices.\8\ In April 2021, Chinese hackers
reportedly penetrated New York City's Metropolitan Transit
Agency, although no damage was reported.\9\ In May 2021, the
Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, which provides water
and wastewater service to 1.8 million people in two Maryland
counties, was also the victim of a ransomware attack.\10\

COMPLEX JURISDICTIONAL LANDSCAPE

Cybersecurity efforts for the transportation sector are led
jointly by the Department of Transportation (DOT), the
Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and the U.S.
Coast Guard.\11\ In the water and wastewater sector, the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is designated as the lead
agency, and its efforts are supported by the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\12\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

INCREASING VULNERABILITIES

Critical infrastructure sectors are facing more significant
vulnerabilities for various reasons, including the
proliferation of information technology and increasing digital
access to computer networks.\13\ Previously, critical
infrastructure equipment was only accessible at its physical
site.\14\ To make any change to the system would require
physically accessing the equipment.\15\ Today, progress in
technology, especially the Internet, has changed the risk
landscape entirely with new and evolving ways to access systems
which have made infrastructure assets more financially
efficient and operationally effective while at the same time
making them more vulnerable to cyber threats.\16\ Demand for
remote work, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has
dramatically increased vulnerabilities, with more employees
needing remote access to systems.\17\ However, making remote
access to systems easier introduces significant vulnerabilities
that bad actors can take advantage of to access those systems
remotely.\18\ Robust cybersecurity protocols can make remote
access more secure. However, they can be time and work-
intensive and not always possible depending on a facility's
staffing and cybersecurity experience.\19\ A vulnerability due
to the use of a remote access program was how hackers were able
to access a water treatment plant in Oldsmar, Florida earlier
this year, for instance.\20\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The vulnerability of transportation infrastructure to
cyberattacks will increase in the future as bad actors make
greater use of emerging technologies, which create new
vulnerabilities to exploit.\21\ Cyberattacks that exploit an
unknown vulnerability, known as a ``zero-day'' attack, provide
no option or ``zero days,'' to fix the issue before it is
successfully used as part of a hack since the attack takes
advantage of a new and previously unknown security flaw.\22\
New technologies provide greater opportunities for zero-day
attacks since they take advantage of technology that is new to
cybersecurity professionals.\23\ In addition, many emerging
technologies in the transportation and infrastructure space
will have various interconnected digital channels, providing
multiple pathways for potential attackers.\24\ Autonomous
vehicles and unmanned aircraft systems are two key examples of
emerging technologies that create multiple cybersecurity
challenges for the future.\25\

HIGH-PROFILE CYBERATTACKS ILLUSTRATE RANGE OF THREATS

Threats to infrastructure systems are increasing, as seen
through several recent high-profile attacks against
transportation infrastructure. Three such attacks include the
recent ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline in May
2021,\26\ the 2017 NotPetya malware attack that affected the
Maersk shipping company,\27\ and the February 2021 intrusion
into the water treatment plant in Oldsmar, Florida.\28\ Each of
these attacks were distinct and highlighted the risks facing
vital infrastructure entities, as well as opportunities for
improving both government and private sector coordination and
oversight of these vulnerabilities.

Ransomware--Colonial Pipeline

On May 7, 2021, Colonial Pipeline, one of the nation's
largest oil and gas pipelines, was the victim of a ransomware
attack by DarkSide, a cyber-criminal group believed to operate
out of Russia.\29\ The attack was discovered when an employee
found a digital ransom note on a system in the Colonial
information technology (IT) network.\30\ DarkSide encrypted all
of Colonial's IT systems and demanded a financial payment in
exchange for a key to unlock the impacted systems.\31\ Though
the attack did not directly affect Colonial's operational
technology (OT) \32\ network, which is used to control the
pipeline equipment, company officials immediately halted
operations throughout the pipeline. They did so to isolate and
contain the damage and ensure the malware did not spread to the
OT network.\33\ The following day, Colonial made a $4.4 million
ransom payment to DarkSide and received the information it
needed to regain control of its IT systems.\34\ Colonial began
work immediately to restore pipeline operations with the
assistance of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration (PHMSA) at DOT, which provided guidance on
temporary manual operations of the pipeline and its subsequent
return to service.\35\ On May 13, 2021, six days after the

\32\ Operational technology (OT) is equipment that handles machines
and their physical operation. OT includes hardware and software that
interacts with the physical environment, including monitoring and
controlling industrial equipment, assets, processes, and events.
Historically, IT and OT networks were entirely isolated from one
another since they developed separately, with OT predating IT. OT used
relatively simple systems that completed specific functions that were
only accessible on-site and in-person. This provided physical isolation
for OT networks, and when IT and the Internet were developed, that
isolation prevented OT from being accessed remotely. This segmentation
was good for security. However, there were business demands for remote
visibility into industrial operations, leading businesses to move
towards a more integrated system. An integrated system has productivity
benefits, including reducing administrative burdens, streamlining work,
and improving data to inform better decision-making. Unfortunately, it
also creates and greatly expands a network's cyber vulnerabilities. A
connection to an IT network can serve as a path to access OT networks.
The safest version of an OT network is one that is completely separated
and has no external connectivity with IT networks or the Internet,
known as an air gap. An air gap is a security measure where a system is
not connected to any other network or device and can only be accessed
physically.

An investigation conducted by cybersecurity consulting firm
FireEye-Mandiant (Mandiant) determined that the attackers used
an employee's legacy username and password to log in to a
virtual private network (VPN) device.\37\ Several missteps
helped enable DarkSide to access Colonial's network in this
manner.\38\ First, the employee's login information was no
longer in use, but had not been deleted from the company's
system.\39\ Second, the legacy VPN profile did not require
multi-factor authentication, such as the use of a one-time
passcode, which CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) recommend as a best practice.\40\ Third, the employee had
used the same password on a different website, from which the
password had been stolen.\41\ CISA recommends using unique
passwords for each device or account.\42\ The president and CEO
of Colonial has said that his company has disabled the legacy
VPN account, has instituted multi-factor authentication for
network access, and is taking other steps to strengthen its
cyber defenses.\43\

Colonial's pipelines transport nearly half of the East
Coast's fuel, providing energy for more than 50 million
Americans. The impact of the ransomware attack was felt
throughout the eastern United States.\44\ The shutdown resulted
in massive fuel shortages and gasoline panic-buying.\45\ At
least 12,000 gas stations in 11 states reported being
completely empty, and the price of gas surpassed $3 a
gallon.\46\ The day before Colonial fully resumed operations,
65 percent of gas stations in North Carolina reported being out
of gas; in Georgia, South Carolina, and Virginia, more than 43
percent of gas stations reported being out of gas.\47\ The
governors of Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia all declared

Malware--NotPetya & Maersk Shipping

In 2017 Russian linked individuals reportedly unleashed a
malware attack in Ukraine named NotPetya.\55\ The malware
affected virtually every federal agency in the country,
crippling four hospitals in the capital, six power companies,
two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, as well as freezing
ATMs and card payment systems in retail and transit
sectors.\56\ Ukraine later estimated that NotPetya wiped 10
percent of all computers in the country, and one government
official said immediately after the attack, ``the government
was dead.'' \57\

multinational shipping company Maersk ($300 million in damage),
the pharmaceutical giant Merck ($800 million), the French
construction company Saint-Gobain ($384 million), FedEx's
European subsidiary ($400 million), as well as smaller victims
such as a hospital in Pennsylvania and a chocolate company in
Australia.\59\ The White House would later identify NotPetya as
the most destructive and costly cyberattack in history, with
overall damage above $10 billion.\60\ The malware even infected
the Russian state oil company, Rosneft, demonstrating the
runaway nature of NotPetya's harms.\61\ The U.S. issued
sanctions against organizations involved in NotPetya's release
and, in 2020, the Department of Justice indicted six Russian
military officers for the cyberattack.\62\

Maersk is the world's largest container shipping company,
responsible for shipping an estimated 25 percent of the world's
food supply.\63\ It is a $56 billion company present in 130
nations with over 700 ships and 17 percent of the world's cargo
shipping container capacity.\64\ The malware entered Maersk's
IT network through a computer in the Ukrainian port of
Odessa.\65\ There, a finance executive had earlier asked IT
administrators to upload the Ukrainian accounting program on a
single computer.\66\ From that computer, NotPetya propagated
through the Maersk global IT system in seven minutes.\67\
Within an hour, all Maersk's end-user devices, including 49,000
laptops and printers and 3,500 of 6,200 servers, were
effectively destroyed.\68\ Maersk's fixed phoneline ceased
functioning and, due to system integration, all Outlook and
cell phone contacts were wiped, crippling initial response
efforts.\69\ Though ships' computers were not affected, the
software at Maersk terminals which received files from their
ships, informing terminal operators of ships' content and how
to direct cargo handling, had been wiped.\70\ Paralysis
resulted at seventeen Maersk terminals worldwide for days, with
no one able to receive cargo for ground transport and
perishable and time-sensitive materials stuck in place.\71\

Intrusions--Oldsmar Wastewater Treatment Plant

On Friday, February 5, 2021, a hacker remotely accessed the
computer system of the water treatment plant for the city of
Oldsmar, Florida, which provides water to about 15,000
people.\78\ The hacker changed chemical levels in the water,
increasing the sodium hydroxide (otherwise known as lye) level
from 100 parts per million to 11,100 parts per million.\79\ In
small quantities, sodium hydroxide is used to control acidity
in water, but at higher levels, it is dangerous to humans. If
the affected water had made it to the city's residents, they
could have become seriously ill.\80\ Ingesting as little as 10
grams of sodium hydroxide can be fatal.\81\

The hack at Oldsmar was discovered immediately when an
employee noticed programs being opened on his computer and that
the level of sodium hydroxide in the water had changed.\82\ The
employee first noticed his computer being accessed remotely
earlier that day but had not reported it because it was common
for supervisors or others to access the system to troubleshoot
issues remotely.\83\ Upon noticing later that the system was
being remotely accessed again and that chemical levels were
being changed to dangerous levels, the employee changed the
chemical levels back to a safe level and reported the
intrusion.\84\ The plant disabled remote access to their system
after the hack and reported the hack to federal
authorities.\85\

The Oldsmar hack provides an example of the vulnerability
of water systems to cybersecurity threats, especially smaller
systems that lack the security controls, IT staff, and funding
of larger organizations. It also shows how remote management
applications, though efficient, create opportunities for
attacks.\89\ The water sector is well-protected from a large-
scale attack on the entire system due to its decentralized
nature, but the existence of thousands of small utilities
across the country makes it challenging to ensure compliance
with best practices throughout the entire sector.\90\ The
investigations from CISA, the FBI, and others, for example,
show that the Oldsmar water treatment plant had poor password
management, an outdated operating system, and an old remote
access management system still on computers.\91\ Further, an
analysis done by Nozomi Networks' Labs determined that the
Oldsmar hack was not very sophisticated and that it was likely
perpetrated by someone without specific background knowledge of
the water treatment process.\92\

POOR CYBERSECURITY HYGIENE CREATES WEAK LINKS

As reliance on IT continues to dominate American lives and
global competitiveness, the Colonial, Maersk, and Oldsmar
attacks illustrate the cybersecurity vulnerabilities found in
common items and the willingness of enemies, whether nation-
state or not, to target these gaps. Cybersecurity in both the
public and private sector can be significantly enhanced by
making easy fixes, such as ensuring known software patches are
implemented quickly, providing regular cybersecurity awareness
training to staff, and using effective passwords and other
authentication systems.\93\ However, the federal government,
organizations, and individuals often fail to take these ``cyber
hygiene'' measures due to resource constraints or lack of
awareness or will, creating easy targets for cybercriminals.
These weak links may result in consequences that threaten the
nation's transportation infrastructure and networks and
potentially harm the public.

LWater Sector Survey. In June 2021, water security
stakeholders issued a report that included a survey of more
than 600 water and wastewater utilities regarding cybersecurity
gaps and needs.\97\ More than 57 percent of water utilities
that responded to the survey have a risk management plan that
addresses cybersecurity threats, while 42 percent do not.\98\
Further, 26 percent conduct cybersecurity risk assessments less
than once per year.\99\ More than 37 percent of small water
utilities said they don't share cybersecurity data because they
don't know who to share this information with or how to do so,
while 22 percent feared the data would not be kept
confidential.\100\ While 75 percent of respondents have
implemented or are in the process of implementing some ``cyber
protection efforts,'' more than 25 percent of water utilities
have no plans to conduct these efforts. Nearly 64 percent do
not employ a chief information security officer (CISO), and
while over 50 percent of water utilities conduct some
cybersecurity-related drill or exercises, 42 percent do
not.\101\ More than 68 percent do not participate in any
cybersecurity-related drills or exercises, but 47 percent said
they need cybersecurity technical assistance, advice, and other
support, and 41 percent said they need federal grants or loans
to improve cybersecurity.\102\

LTransit Sector Survey. The Mineta Transportation
Institute and San Jose State University produced a recent
report on transit-related cybersecurity issues that included a
survey of 90 transit agencies serving more than 124 million
people.\103\ Among the results, over 50 percent of those
surveyed had up to four staff dedicated to cybersecurity while
nearly 39 percent had no dedicated staff, three of which are
considered ``extra-large'' agencies with more than $100 million
in operating expenses.\104\ In addition, four of 20 agencies
that reported having a cybersecurity incident still have no
staff dedicated to cybersecurity.\105\ Over 60 percent of
transit agencies surveyed provide cybersecurity training to
staff, while more than 24 percent provide no training, and more
than 58 percent of those that don't provide training said it
was due to a lack of resources.\106\ In addition, 42 percent of
the agencies don't have an incident response plan, and of those
that had one, over half have not had an exercise in over a
year.\107\ Nearly 78 percent of the 90 agencies surveyed said
they had not had a cybersecurity ``incident.'' \108\ The
authors found this troubling since given the frequency of
cyberattacks, it suggests that many of these transit agencies
may simply not be detecting successful cybersecurity
penetrations against their networks.\109\ In addition, more
than 30 percent of those that said they had been the victim of
a cybersecurity incident also said they never reported the
incident to anyone.\110\

PRIVATE-PUBLIC COORDINATION

In the United States, it is generally cited that 85 percent
of critical infrastructure is in private hands, and much of the
transportation sector is subject to some government
oversight.\111\ As such, cooperation between the public and
private sectors that fosters integrated, collaborative
engagement and interaction is essential to maintaining
transportation infrastructure cybersecurity, especially as
technology makes transportation infrastructure increasingly
vulnerable to cyberattacks.\112\ The annual cost of malicious
cyber activity to the U.S. economy, estimated recently at
between $57 billion and $109 billion, demonstrates the pressing
need for action in both the private and public sectors.\113\

experience of the private sector remains vital to create
effective cyber resilience.\114\ Addressing the biggest gaps,

CYBERSECURITY WORKFORCE SHORTAGES

There is a dire shortage globally of workers with
cybersecurity expertise. In the U.S., recent estimates show
around 950,000 individuals currently employed in this field,
with a need to fill an additional 464,000 cyber-related
positions.\115\ In the public sector alone, there are about
60,000 individuals employed in cyber jobs, with an additional
36,000 unfilled positions across all levels of government.\116\

also show that the shortage of cybersecurity professionals can
have real consequences. One-third of respondents said a
shortage of skills makes their organizations more desirable

staff strength has damaged their organization's reputation and
led directly to the loss of proprietary data through a
cyberattack.\118\

VOLUNTARY STANDARDS AND NEW FEDERAL LEADERSHIP

In 2013, in response to an Executive Order, the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) began developing
the first national cybersecurity framework consistent with its
mission to promote U.S. innovation and competitiveness.\123\ In
May 2017, applying the framework, widely touted by
cybersecurity experts, became mandatory for federal
agencies.\124\ Compliance is still voluntary in the private
sector, with NIST estimating a 50 percent adoption rate among
private actors in 2020.\125\

protecting federal government networks, building on past
executive action, including executive orders issued in 2017 and
2013.\126\ Although the primary aim of the EO is to strengthen
federal systems, it also notes that much of the nation's
infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector and
encourages these companies to ``follow the Federal government's
lead and take ambitious measures to augment and align
cybersecurity investments with the goal of minimizing future
incidents.'' \127\ The EO also establishes a Cybersecurity
Review Board, modeled after the National Transportation Safety
Board, composed of private sector entities and federal
officials to review significant cyberattacks and share lessons
learned.\128\

supplement mandatory cyber protocol requirements related to
pipelines issued two months earlier.\135\ TSA is reportedly
preparing similar directives for the rail and aviation sectors.

VOLUNTARY REPORTING AND LACK OF GOVERNMENT DATA SHARING

Reporting cybersecurity incidents--across the critical
infrastructure spectrum--is also largely voluntary, a decades-
old legacy of the days before large-scale cyberattacks and
networked critical infrastructure.\137\ Many actors responsible
for critical infrastructure agree that what should be reported
and to whom in the federal, state, and local governments
regarding a cyber incident can be unclear.\138\ Further,
requiring private entities to report cybersecurity-related data
to the government has long been subject to debate, and the
complexity of some proposed reporting models has raised
concerns about the disproportionate burdens placed on smaller
private actors.\139\ Therefore, a complete understanding of the
cyber threats to the nation is likely underestimated in the
face of these dynamics. In 2016, for example, the FBI estimated
that only 15 percent of cybercrime victims reported the crime
to law enforcement.\140\

Recent EO 14028 also encourages sharing cyber-related
threat data between the private sector and the federal
government and requires federal IT contractors to report cyber
incidents to the government, although reporting cyber incidents
from privately-owned infrastructure assets or transportation
systems remains voluntary.\141\ Obtaining a more holistic

threats.\142\

for critical infrastructure have concerns with reporting cyber
incidents to the federal government.\144\ These concerns
include bad press, regulatory reprisal, or minimal public
consequences for cyber attackers.\145\ Further, private actors
who proactively seek out information from the federal

CONCLUSION

As America seeks to remain globally competitive and provide
Americans with safe and secure infrastructure, cybersecurity
will remain a top priority. During this hearing, the Committee
will hear from private sector witnesses, but it intends to hold
a second cybersecurity hearing on these issues in the future
that will focus on federal agencies and their efforts to close
the current cybersecurity gaps that put industry and government
at greater risk of attacks, actions to assist the private
sector, and what steps they are taking to implement recent
federal cybersecurity directives.

Today, we are going to hear about the challenges and gaps
in protecting our Nation's transportation systems and critical
infrastructure from cyberattacks, and recommendations from
private industry and cybersecurity experts on how to close
those gaps.
Notably, this hearing is largely being conducted online,
demonstrating how much we all rely on cyber systems to carry
out our basic day-to-day tasks, particularly in the era of
COVID.
And even with dedicated and superb IT support and lots of
experience, getting everything right 100 percent of the time is
tough. Well, with the House system it is not even close to
that. But anyway, we won't go into that.
But when it comes to the Nation's critical infrastructure
and transportation networks--pipelines that fuel our economy,
water and wastewater treatment plants, shipping, aviation,
railroads, and highways that play a critical role in bringing
vital supplies to all Americans--getting everything right every
time must be the goal. Lives are on the line. And each day,
when you turn on a faucet, flush your toilet, or when you board
a plane, fill up your car with gas, you trust that these
systems will work.
But that trust has been shaken in recent years. We have
seen headlines about blows to the Nation's economy from
ransomware attacks by criminal networks on critical
infrastructure, and close calls where individual hackers have
tried to go after wastewater systems. By the way, they have,
many of them, used massive amounts of chlorine. If they can
valve that chlorine into the air, they are going to kill a lot
of people. And otherwise infiltrate our drinking water systems.
The cyber threats and vulnerabilities are diverse,
expanding, and constantly evolving, and have the potential to
impact everyone. Yet, an estimated 85 percent--85 percent--of
the Nation's critical infrastructure is in private hands, owned
and operated by private entities.
Too often, leaders whose organizations are at risk from
cyberattacks weigh the risks of an attack against the cost of
increasing cybersecurity protections, and they decide to roll
the dice. Hey, it might hurt the stock price if we actually
spend a little money on an updated IT system, or better
cybersecurity, and, hey, that will hurt my annual bonus. So,
let's skate, and hope we get away with it. They are betting
they won't get attacked.
The good news is, even basic steps, like mandating strong
passwords--pathetic--and multifactor authentication,
cybersecurity awareness training, and regularly practicing
simple cybersecurity exercises, things that cost virtually
nothing, and are common sense, can significantly harden cyber
defenses and dramatically diminish a company, utility, or
Federal agency's chances that they will fall victim to a
successful attack.
Unfortunately, recent surveys have shown that too many
public and private entities don't take these simple steps. In a
recent survey of the transit sector, nearly 39 percent of those
surveyed have no--none, zero--staff dedicated to cybersecurity,
and more than 24 percent provide no cybersecurity training to
their staff at all. Many of them are using the password on the
device when they got it. They don't--you know, just crazy
stuff. This doesn't cost anything.
The water sector is even worse. In a survey published in
June of this year, 42 percent of water and wastewater utilities
surveyed said they conduct no--no, zero--cybersecurity training
for their staff, and more than 68 percent of them said they do
not participate in any cybersecurity-related drills or
exercises.
Many experts believe we don't have a full and transparent
picture of the cybersecurity threats that confront us, impeding
our ability to quantify the risks and to learn about lessons
from past attacks. Reporting cyber breaches, yes, it can hurt
your financial bottom line for a little bit, but overall, in
the end, you are going to benefit, your stockholder is going to
benefit, the American people are going to benefit if you put
these protections in place.
The FBI has estimated only 15 percent of cyber crimes are
actually reported--15 percent--to the Government. In a recent
survey of the transit sector, more than 30 percent of those
surveyed said they had been the victim of a cybersecurity
incident, but they never reported the incident to anybody.
With the public's safety and national economic security of
the United States at stake, it may be time for voluntary steps
by the private sector to give way to mandatory Federal
reporting requirements.
In 2013, NIST, the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, in consultation with industry, academia, and
Government, created a cybersecurity risk management framework.
Since 2017, the framework has been mandatory for Federal
agencies, but it hasn't eliminated all the problems, something
that we will explore more at a future hearing.
In the private sector, however, use of the NIST framework
remains voluntary and is used unevenly. NIST estimated that, in
2020, only 50 percent of private companies were even trying to
reach NIST cybersecurity minimum standards.
The Biden administration has finally begun to change
things. In May 2021, the President issued Executive Order 14028
to encourage critical infrastructure companies to, quote:
``follow the Federal Government's lead and take ambitious
measures to augment and align cybersecurity investments with
the goal of minimizing future incidents.''
In June of this year, DHS's Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency issued guidance that addresses
complex networked IT and operational technology, or OT systems,
and helps to establish standards for preparing and responding
to cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure. The Biden
administration also issued a National Security Memorandum that
called for the creation of cyber performance goals, including
establishing baseline cybersecurity performance standards
consistent across all critical infrastructure sectors.
Just this summer, in the wake of the Colonial Pipeline
cyberattack, the Transportation Security Administration
abandoned voluntary compliance. They had already offered to do
a full audit of cybersecurity for Colonial Pipeline. Colonial
Pipeline--it wouldn't have cost them anything--they didn't want
to do that, because they didn't want to know what their
problems were. Well, it cost them a lot of money, and they
could have had an evaluation, and perhaps closed the door
before the ransomware attack.
So, the TSA has abandoned voluntary compliance for
pipelines altogether, issuing a directive mandating specific
protections to defend against ransomware, along with
cybersecurity contingency and recovery plans. TSA is reportedly
preparing similar directives for other critical infrastructure
sectors, including rail and aviation.
So, we have an administration that is moving in the right
direction. We need to do more.
No single technology, policy, or other action will
completely eliminate all cyber threats. But every step can help
close the gaps and make success for cyber criminals and cyber
terrorists harder.
I look forward to hearing our witnesses' ideas about how we
can do that. You have been in the trenches of the silent cyber
conflict that goes on every day in our critical infrastructure
sectors. You all have ideas on how Government, private
industry, or both, working together, can increase our Nation's
cyber resilience to protect our critical infrastructure and
public, and to recover from cyberattacks when they do occur,
despite our best efforts.
So, thanks to our witnesses for joining us, and I will turn
now to the ranking member, Mr. Crawford, for his opening
remarks.
[Mr. DeFazio's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Peter A. DeFazio, a Representative in
Congress from the State of Oregon, and Chair, Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure
Today we will hear about the challenges and gaps in protecting our
nation's transportation systems and critical infrastructure from
cyberattacks, and recommendations on how to close those gaps from

But that trust has been shaken in recent years. We have seen
headlines about blows to the nation's economy from ransomware attacks
by criminal networks on critical infrastructure, and close calls where
disgruntled individual hackers have tried to turn water from our
faucets into poison that would do us harm.
These cyber threats and vulnerabilities are diverse, expanding, and
constantly evolving, and have the potential to impact everyone. Yet, an

instance. Overall, the FBI has estimated only 15 percent of cyber-
crimes are actually reported to the government at all. In a recent
survey of the transit sector, more than 30 percent of those surveyed
who said they had been the victim of a cybersecurity incident said they
never reported the incident to anyone.
With the public's safety and the national and economic security of
the United States at stake, it may be time for voluntary steps by the
private sector to give way to mandatory federal reporting requirements.
In 2013, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or
NIST, in consultation with industry, academia, and government, created
a cybersecurity risk management framework. Since 2017, that framework
has been mandatory for federal agencies, but it has not eliminated all
problems, something we will explore more at a future hearing. In the
private sector, however, use of the NIST framework remains voluntary,
and it is used unevenly. NIST estimated that in 2020 only 50 percent of
private companies were even trying to reach NIST cybersecurity minimum
standards.
The Biden administration has finally begun to change things. In May
2021, the president issued Executive Order 14028 to encourage critical
infrastructure companies to quote, ``follow the Federal government's
lead and take ambitious measures to augment and align cybersecurity
investments with the goal of minimizing future incidents.''
In June of this year, DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency issued guidance that addresses complex, networked IT
and Operating Technology, or OT, systems and helps to establish
standards for preparing and responding to cyberattacks targeting
critical infrastructure.
The Biden administration also issued a national security memorandum
that called for the creation of cyber-performance goals including
establishing baseline cybersecurity performance standards consistent
across all critical infrastructure sectors.
In late summer, in the wake of the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack,
the Transportation Security Administration abandoned voluntary
compliance for pipelines altogether, issuing a directive mandating
specific protections to defend against ransomware attacks, along with
cybersecurity contingency and recovery plans. The TSA is reportedly
preparing similar directives for other critical infrastructure sectors,
including rail and aviation.
So, we have an administration that is moving in the right
direction. But we need to do more. No single technology, policy, or
other action will completely eliminate all cyber threats. But each step
can help close the gaps and make success for the cybercriminals and
cyberterrorists harder.
I look forward to hearing our witnesses' ideas about how we can do
that. You all have been in the trenches of the silent cyber conflict
that goes on each day in our critical infrastructure sectors. And you
all have ideas on how government, private industry, or both working
together can increase our nation's cyber resilience to protect our
critical infrastructure and the public, and to recover when
cyberattacks do occur, despite our best efforts.
So, thank you to our witnesses for joining us. I look forward to
your testimony. With that I recognize Ranking Member Graves for his
opening statement.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Chair. As we all know, the
cyber threats facing our Nation's infrastructure have increased
significantly as technology has become more essential and
interwoven in our society, both in infrastructure and more
broadly in our daily lives. While technology has allowed us to
innovate and create efficiencies in infrastructure and
transportation networks, it has also brought us new threats and
vulnerabilities.
Unfortunately, with recent high-profile cyberattacks like
those conducted on Colonial Pipeline or various wastewater
treatment plants, we have seen a very clear need to better
protect our Nation's infrastructure through strong
cybersecurity defense measures.
Fortunately, many transportation and infrastructure
operators are already taking action to protect their assets and
the passengers and customers that rely on them.
While the Federal Government is working to help the private
sector prevent, mitigate, and respond to cyber threats, our
cyber adversaries' technology is advancing more quickly than
anything the Federal Government can mandate. In light of this
reality, I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today
about their best practices for cyber defense across varying
transportation modes.
I would also like to highlight a specific concern regarding
the TSA's recent mandatory security directives on cybersecurity
for pipelines, and forthcoming directives for rail, transit,
and aviation. I am concerned that the TSA's recent security
directives are overly prescriptive, rushed, and fail to take
into account holistic feedback from diverse stakeholders. I
would like to hear stakeholders' input on this issue today, but
we must also hear from Government witnesses to get the full
picture. So, I look forward to following up on this topic to
ensure that we get every perspective, as well.
We need to hear how the various agencies are working with
the operators of our Nation's infrastructure as true partners
in improving the standards and practices we are using to
protect America's infrastructure and transportation networks
from growing cyber threats.
Thank you, and I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Belcher. Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Crawford, and
members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to
appear for you today and discuss the pressing need to
strengthen cybersecurity capabilities of the U.S. public
transit.
Enterprise risk management in the U.S. public transit
industry needs a 21st-century upgrade.
Mr. DeFazio. Mr. Belcher, could you either perhaps speak up
a little, turn up your volume, or maybe we can do it on our
end? Just a little bit would be great.
Mr. Belcher. OK, let me--enterprise risk management in the
U.S. public transit industry needs a 21st-century upgrade,
whereby specific attention is paid to strengthening cyber
protection and preparedness across the industry.
Is that better? Can you hear me better now?
Mr. DeFazio. Yes, thank you.
Mr. Belcher. OK. It is critical that transit agencies
better understand how their risk profile is changing, and the
threat landscape is evolving. Even the smallest and most
conventional public transit agencies today rely on multiple
digital technologies that expose them to cyber threats, whether
it is through digital enabled hardware or systems that are
managed in their yards.
Last year, my colleagues and I released a report from the
Mineta Transportation Institute entitled, ``Is the Transit
Industry Prepared for the Cyber Revolution? Policy
Recommendations to Enhance Surface Transit Cyber
Preparedness.'' Our bottom line takeaway was that most transit
operators have a lot of work to do to elevate their
understanding of and preparedness for cyber-related risks to
their operations, their data, and their business
infrastructure. Our report concludes that, for many transit
agencies, internal resources for cybersecurity are scarce, and
even among those agencies that have resources, and that are
aware, acquiring these resources are a long and laborious
activity.
In our view, there needs to be a collaborative effort
between the Federal Government, the industry, and agency
leadership to establish, maintain, refine, and support
cybersecurity programs.
Most transit agencies are unprepared to prevent or respond
to the broad array of threat vectors, ranging from phishing and
business email compromise to data breaches and ransomware
attacks. In fact, a key finding from our report is that many
agencies do not have an accurate sense of their cybersecurity
preparedness.
On the one hand, 81 percent of the responding agencies
believe that they are prepared to manage and defend against
cybersecurity threats. In fact, 73 percent of those respondents
felt that they had adequate information to help implement their
cybersecurity preparedness programs. Even so, only 60 percent
of the respondents have a cybersecurity program in place; 43
percent of the respondents do not believe they have the
resources necessary for cybersecurity preparedness; and only 47
percent of the respondents audit their cybersecurity programs
on an annual basis. That is simply unacceptable.
Despite the industry differences, cybersecurity maturity
models exist, and assessment practices that are used across
other industries are transferable, and can be transferred and
utilized in the transit industry.
The transit industry is experiencing an increasing number
of high-profile attacks. We have seen the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority in New York City, we have seen
Martha's Vineyard Ferry in Massachusetts, we have seen the
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or SEPTA,
in Philadelphia be hacked in the last year. And in fact, just
last week we saw the Toronto Transit Commission be attacked by
a malware attack, and that had a significant impact. And in
fact, between June of 2020 and June of 2021, there has been a
186-percent increase in weekly ransomware attacks in the
transportation industry.
Risk management priorities identified by transit executives
identified that business continuity and data protection are the
two areas most immediately at risk to cyber threats.
So, with that, thank you for the opportunity, and for your
continued leadership in this space. My written testimony has
been submitted for the record, and I look forward to responding
to your questions.
[Mr. Belcher's prepared statement follows:]

Scott Belcher, President and Chief Executive Officer, SFB Consulting,
LLC, on behalf of Mineta Transportation Institute
Enterprise risk management in the U.S. public transit industry
needs a twenty-first century upgrade, whereby specific attention is
paid to strengthening cyber protections and preparedness across the
industry. Risk as defined by most industry providers focuses primarily
on the physical risks posed to the organization and its service
delivery. Investments have been made for decades to reduce this risk,
as it is understood that most threats that are likely to impair transit
operations with regularity are physical (e.g., threats against
operators and passengers, damage to vehicles, and theft). However, as
digital technologies continue to be woven into the operations of even
the most conventional public transit agency, any system, process, or
function dedicated to reducing physical risk likely includes an array
of digital vulnerabilities that need to be managed in concert with
current security operations. The increasing frequency and magnitude of
cyber threats also increases their potential to negatively impact
existing systems designed to reduce physical risk. Risk governance
decisions should prioritize potential physical threats, but the design
and management of any comprehensive enterprise risk infrastructure in
today's world must improve and integrate cybersecurity best practices
alongside the physical security priorities.
Based on the findings of the 2020 Mineta Transportation Institute
(MTI) Report, Is the Transit Industry Prepared for the Cyber
Revolution? Policy Recommendations to Enhance Surface Transit Cyber
Preparedness \1\ (hereinafter, the 2020 MTI Report) and research to
date, the authors believe transit operators need to elevate their
understanding of and preparedness for cyber-related risks to their
operations, data, and business infrastructure. Further, given the
dependence transit agencies have on vendors, opportunities exist for
the industry to enlist the help of the vendor community to support and
in some cases lead the improvement of cyber risk management across the
supply chain.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enterprise Risk Management: The methods and processes used by an
enterprise to manage risks to its mission and to establish the trust
necessary for the enterprise to support shared missions. It involves
the identification of mission dependencies on enterprise capabilities,
the identification and prioritization of risks due to defined threats,
the implementation of countermeasures to provide both a static risk
posture and an effective dynamic response to active threats; and it
assesses enterprise performance against threats and adjusts
countermeasures as necessary.\2\
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The\\ 2020 MTI Report highlights that some agencies have taken
action to protect themselves by seeking technical leadership from
outside the transit industry, contracting out the management of
personally identifiable information (PII), and seeking support from
their supply chain partners. Some include cybersecurity requirements in
their contracts with suppliers, one of the more basic and least
expensive means to begin maturing an organization's cyber risk posture.
And still others have operationalized cybersecurity requirements
through actions in partnership with their supply chain, such as annual
audits and ongoing monitoring and alerting that is closely coordinated
between agency and vendor. Many agencies, however, have not yet
embarked on such efforts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/enterprise_risk_management
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 2020 MTI Report concludes that for many transit agencies,
internal resources for cybersecurity are scarce, as even among those
agencies and individuals that recognize the growing threat, acquisition
of necessary resources is a long, laborious activity. In the view of
the authors, there needs to be a collaborative effort between the
federal government, the industry, and transit agency leadership to
establish, maintain, refine, and support cybersecurity programs. Both
carrots and sticks are required to ensure the necessary resources are
made available and utilized. The authors emphasize that the Federal
Transit Administration (FTA) should require transit organizations to
adopt and implement minimum cybersecurity standards prior to receiving
federal funding. To date, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and
the FTA has largely deferred to the Transportation Security
Administration (TSA) in this space. This is about to change.
Transportation infrastructure is a target for nefarious actors
seeking to disrupt, be it for personal or political gain. The avenues
to exploit this vital infrastructure will continue to evolve along with
the technology that enables the industry's core operations and goals.
As these technologies are further embedded in operations, new
vulnerabilities will arise. Accounting for the risk today will foster
greater resiliency and preparedness in the years to come.
The mission of public transit is to move people as safely and
efficiently as possible. Public transportation is a multi-faceted,
complex, and expansive ecosystem that relies on people, processes, and
associated technologies to ensure that it achieves its mission as
seamlessly as possible. Security has always been a foundational aspect
of public transit operations. Moving people at scale has inherent risk,
and every transit agency takes deliberate steps to reduce physical risk
wherever possible. An unsafe public transit system impairs the agency
in executing its mission, as the public's sense of safety has a direct
correlation to their willingness to use the public transit system to
move about the community. Digital technologies are playing an
increasingly important role in operations security. It is critical that
transit agencies understand how their risk profile is changing, and
ensure their systems, processes, and procedures engaged to address such
risk are effectively resourced and adequately managed.
The transit industry depends on a myriad of technologies, from the
physical systems that manage access to the garage to the databases that
house operational data or employee information. Technological
advancements in general and their expanded application to the transit
industry more specifically offer significant advantages for both
providers and customers--improved service quality, operational
efficiencies, and reduced costs. With each of these advancements,
however, comes an additional level of risk that must be weighed and
managed by transit providers and their suppliers. Cyber vulnerabilities
attributable to the expanding digital ecosystem are prime among these
growing risks.
In the 2020 MTI Report, the authors described the unprecedented
increase in the volume of data collected and maintained by modern
transit operators, the addition of numerous vendors to help manage
these growing technology demands on the industry, and the resulting
need to spend more time and money securing newly exposed cybersecurity
threats. Many transit agencies, the report found, were unprepared to
prevent or respond to the broad array of identified threat vectors--
ranging from phishing and business email compromise to data breaches to
ransomware attacks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A key finding from the 2020 MTI Report is that many agencies do not have an accurate sense of their
cybersecurity preparedness.

81% of responding agencies believe they are prepared to manage and defend against cybersecurity
threats, and;

73% feel they have access to information that helps them implement their cybersecurity preparedness
program

Yet . . .

Only 60% actually have a cybersecurity preparedness program;

43% do not believe they have the resources necessary for cybersecurity preparedness; and

Only 47% audit their cybersecurity program at least once per year.\3\
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It\\ is essential for transit agencies to develop and maintain
mature enterprise risk management systems to mitigate threats to
people, operations, and data. This need is neither new nor unique to
the transit industry. Part of running any business is taking the
necessary steps to protect critical assets. The added challenge
organizations face today, however, is the increasing role of digital
technologies in all areas of business operations. The resulting need is
to have robust cyber risk management practices that span the
organization to ensure the continued protection of critical assets.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preparedness p. 32.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moreover, greater cybersecurity oversight is on its way. The Biden
Administration has been vocal about the need for greater engagement in
cybersecurity oversight by the federal government. The President on May
12, 2021, issued an Executive Order stating:

It is the policy of my Administration that the prevention,
detection, assessment, and remediation of cyber incidents is a
top priority and essential to national and economic security.
The Federal Government must lead by example. All Federal
Information Systems should meet or exceed the standards and
requirements for cybersecurity set forth in and issued pursuant
to this order.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/
2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/

The Executive Order applies specifically to Federal agencies and
their suppliers, but it is only a matter of time before the extensive
set of requirements included in this Executive Order flow down to
recipients of Federal funds.
In a similar vein, the Department of Defense on November 20, 2020,
began implementation of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification
(CMMC), which is a unifying standard for vendors to ensure they are
implementing cybersecurity across the Defense Industrial Base (DIB).

The CMMC framework includes a comprehensive and scalable
certification element to verify the implementation of processes
and practices associated with the achievement of a
cybersecurity maturity level. CMMC is designed to provide
increased assurance to the Department that a DIB company can
adequately protect sensitive unclassified information,
accounting for information flow down to subcontractors in a
multi-tier supply chain.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ https://www.acq.osd.mil/cmmc/faq.html

Again, while the CMMC currently only applies to contractors in the
DIB, procurement practices that start in the defense arena regularly
move into the non-defense arena and procurement and cybersecurity
professionals both anticipate this transition.
Finally, Congress has introduced several bills to address
cyberattacks against private-sector targets and critical
infrastructure, which includes the U.S. transportation sector. The U.S.
House Energy and Commerce Committee on July 20, 2021, passed eight
cybersecurity bills. The eight-bill package will increase requirements
for private companies to report on cybersecurity incidents and provide
funding for state and local governments to increase cybersecurity
measures.\6\ Subsequently, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) on July 22, 2021,
introduced a bipartisan bill that would require the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to identify and mitigate threats
to the operational technology systems of pieces of critical
infrastructure.\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both the public and private sector have developed a great deal of
cybersecurity guidance over the past two decades. Cybersecurity experts
will tell you that the tools used to manage cybersecurity and
associated threats do not vary greatly across industries but that some
industries are more mature in their understanding when it comes to
managing cyber risks. Industries such as the financial management
industry where billions of dollars are moved digitally every minute
have been forced to invest heavily in cybersecurity protection. Other
industries such as the transit industry, which has traditionally been a
hardware-based industry that relied largely on firmware and closed
networks, have not faced the same urgency until recently.
The 2020 MTI Report observes that ``[t]he existing cybersecurity
guidance for public transit is spread across numerous government and
industry entities . . . [and that] federal resources exist for agencies
to improve their cybersecurity readiness.'' \8\ The same baseline
documents are at the core of every industry cybersecurity program.
Despite industry differences, cybersecurity maturity models and the
assessment practices used to strengthen policies, procedures, and
practices are transferable.

Preparedness MTI Report p. 35.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the key foundations for cybersecurity programs across any
industry comes from the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST). NIST is a non-regulatory agency that has no authority to
dictate the use of any standard, but its standards carry significant
weight. The work of NIST is defined by federal statutes, executive
orders, and policies--including developing cybersecurity standards and
guidelines for federal agencies. NIST's cybersecurity program supports
its overall mission to promote U.S. innovation and industrial
competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and
related technology through research and development.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2014, NIST released the ``Framework for Improving Critical
Infrastructure Security'' in response to Presidential Executive Order
13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity,\10\ which
called for a standardized security framework for critical
infrastructure in the United States. This guidance is not intended to
be a how-to guide for cybersecurity; rather, it is a framework designed
to help a wide range of organizations assess risk and make sound
decisions about prioritizing and allocating resources to reduce the
risk of compromise or failure in their computer networks. For any
organization to leverage the NIST Framework, customized implementation
is required in ways that are not necessarily obvious from the document.
The guidance is equally applicable to public and private industry.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To further support organizations in the face of a growing cyber
threat, Congress established the CISA at the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) through the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency Act of 2018.\11\ According to DHS, ``CISA is the
Nation's risk advisor, working with partners to defend against today's
threats and collaborating to build more secure and resilient
infrastructure for the future.'' \12\ CISA coordinates a collective
defense to identify and vet procedures to manage and reduce the impact
from disruption to critical infrastructure. In this role, the
organization builds and coordinates relationships across industries
working with sector specific agencies, such as the U.S. DOT, the FTA,
the TSA, among others.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3359
\12\ https://www.cisa.gov/about-cisa
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CISA's role is to unite government and private sector partners,
with a particular focus on 16 Critical Infrastructure Sectors:

There are 16 critical infrastructure sectors whose assets,
systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are
considered so vital to the United States that their
incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect
on security, national economic security, national public health
or safety, or any combination thereof.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\ https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors

The public transit industry is part of the Transportation Security
Sector (TSS), which is one of the 16 critical sectors. As such, the
industry has direct access to CISA's capabilities and resources, such
as intelligence analysis, data assessment, response methods
development, and assistance to manage risks to critical infrastructure
that often spike from emerging threats. CISA leads a systematic
approach to manage and reduce cyber risk that includes providing
services, cyber training, support to critical infrastructure operators,
and risk analysis.
The TSA is another critical cybersecurity player. TSA's origins
date back to the days after September 11, 2001, when it was formed as
part of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act. Its ``mission is
to protect the nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of
movement for people and commerce.'' \14\ Given its provenance, TSA's
original orientation centered on physical security, but the agency ``is
responsible for securing the nation's transportation systems from all
threats, including both physical and cyber.'' \15\ In this latter role,
TSA overlaps with CISA. TSA explains the division of labor as follows:

https://www.tsa.gov/news/releases/2018/12/04/tsa-releases-
cybersecurity-roadmap (accessed March 13, 2020).

Although TSA has responsibility for oversight of both the
physical security and cybersecurity of the [TSS], TSA is not
directly responsible for the defense of the private sector
portion of TSS information technology infrastructure. Rather,
TSA serves a vital role in ensuring the cybersecurity
resilience of the TSS infrastructure and will work with the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), with
its mission to protect the critical infrastructure of the
United States.\16\

DHS in 2015 built upon the NIST Framework and issued a document
``to provide the TSS guidance, resource direction, and a directory of
options to assist a TSS organization, [including public transit
agencies], in adopting an industry-compatible version of the NIST
Framework.'' \17\ This guidance was designed both for transit agencies
that have an existing risk-management program and for agencies that do
not yet have a formal cybersecurity program.\18\ The TSS Cybersecurity
Framework Implementation Guidance and its companion workbook provide an
approach for Transportation Systems Sector \19\ owners and operators to
apply the tenets of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to help reduce
cyber risks.

Recent events have demonstrated the need to be proactive when it
comes to cybersecurity. Major attacks such as SolarWinds, Colonial
Pipeline, JBS Foods, and Acer have caused significant interruption and
cost to the global economy. The transit industry has experienced a
number of high-profile attacks as well. Cyber-attacks have involved the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in New York City, the
Martha's Vineyard Ferry in Massachusetts, and the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in Philadelphia. Between
June of 2020 and June of 2021, the global transportation industry
witnessed a 186% increase in weekly ransomware attacks.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

the-transportation-industry-2021/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This flood of activity and associated attention has raised a level
of alarm throughout the government and the transit industry. Working
with industry experts from other more mature fields such as financial
management and defense, the researchers learned that the executives of
these industries have come to treat cybersecurity threats as they treat
the many other high-profile threats that the organizations' executive
teams must evaluate, prioritize, and manage on an on-going basis.
Of the risk management priorities identified by transit executives,
business continuity and data protection are the two areas most
immediately at risk to cyber threats. The good news is that there are
steps that transit providers can take--with the participation and
support of vendors--to mature existing risk management practices and
implement industry-specific cyber defenses.
People Safety
Creating and maintaining a safe environment for customers,
employees, and the communities in which transit agencies provide
services is essential for general risk mitigation and continuity of
operations. Whether the safety incident involves a bus or train
encountering another vehicle or an obstruction, or it involves a
physical threat posed to a passenger, the transit operating system and
its digital assets have rarely been directly involved. The increasing
connectivity of vehicles both to other networked systems and to the
internet is changing this dynamic.
Until recently, the potential for digital tools to access physical
operating systems among most public transit agencies was not feasible,
as most systems were safely segregated from the internet. The advent
and exponential growth of internet-enabled devices has stripped most
systems of this protection. Applications enabling automatic vehicle
locator (AVL) or global positioning systems (GPS) technologies to track
vehicles in real time, for example, are also generally reliant on
connected and networked operating systems. Even the transition to
electric buses brings with it a whole new level of cyber exposure and
other security risks not previously anticipated.
Connected vehicle technologies that enable communication among
vehicles on the road, infrastructure, and personal devices, can connect
to the internet and vital operating systems--creating new access points
for disruption. Transit operators have been piloting and, in some
cases, deploying this new safety technology, which brings with it a new
cybersecurity threat vulnerability that must be managed. Similarly, as
transit operators test and deploy new levels of autonomy, whether it is
for bus rapid transit or for first and last mile shuttles, they are
exposing their operating systems and their passengers to new cyber
risks. Fortunately, to date, there are no known recorded instances of
malicious actors exploiting these vulnerabilities to remotely hijack or
otherwise disrupt public transit vehicles. The access points to do so,
however, are there and have been breached by researchers.
Business Continuity
Interruptions to day-to-day business operations face the most
pronounced cyber risk because an increasing amount of transit
operations relies on digitally connected systems. Everything from when
a bus is scheduled to depart a yard to which operator should be driving
it are managed by internet-enabled devices and systems. Yard management
and operator scheduling software are increasingly commonplace in public
transit agencies. These systems, in turn, feed into public-facing
route-planning services on which customers rely to complete their
journeys. The public schedules also live on an increasing array of
digital systems and services, from the agency's website and mobile
applications to third-party services like Google Maps and Uber. A
disruption to any one of these systems and the transmission of the data
they produce can impair or halt service delivery. For example, SEPTA,
suffered a ransomware attack resulting in severe network disruption in
August 2020. Vancouver, Canada's TransLink transportation suffered a
similar attack in December 2020. Like SEPTA, the services and systems
on which TransLink relied to conduct day-to-day business operations
were disrupted or sidelined. TransLink suffered from deactivated ticket
kiosks and metro card readers, phone and internet outages, and offline
GPS, tracking, and reporting services.

Operational Technology (OT) is the hardware and software that detects or
causes a change, through the direct monitoring and/or control of
industrial equipment, assets, processes, and events.

Information Technology (IT) is the common term for the entire spectrum
of technologies for information processing, including software,
hardware, communications technologies, and related services. In
general, IT does not include embedded technologies that do not generate
data for enterprise use.\21\
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Personal\\ and Financial Data
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\21\ https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The acquisition and exploitation of personal and financial data is
a common goal of cyber criminals because it can be easily monetized in
forums where individuals and organizations are willing to trade or pay
for the information. Transit agencies are in possession of employee and
customer data, specifically personal and financial information, which
can hold appeal to nefarious actors. The previously cited Vancouver
TransLink ransomware attack resulted in a lawsuit against TransLink by
employees who accused the company of not doing enough to protect their
personal and banking information--much of which was compromised during
the attack.
As transit providers adopt new systems to augment and improve
service--mobile pay, advanced trip planning, on-board Wi-Fi, etc.--they
are increasingly likely to be in possession of more high-value customer
data. Special services for older adults and paratransit services for
individuals unable to use fixed route services may also require
communication or documentation about sensitive health information--none
of which the transit agency nor the customer wishes to have in the
hands of a nefarious actor. Without implementing robust protection
systems, the transit provider is likely to be risking the security of
their passengers' data and may not even be in the position to know if
or when a system is breached.
Most transit operators outsource fare management and the associated
passenger data to PCI compliant vendors, which helps them to manage one
of their biggest cybersecurity risks. Operators are now becoming more
sophisticated in the contractual requirements that they impose upon
their fare management partners to ensure that these vendors have a
mature and comprehensive cyber protection system in place.
Transit operators are entering into a challenging new world where
digital technology increases their cyber threat risks exponentially.
Simultaneously, the Federal Government is increasing its focus on
cybersecurity. As such, the transit industry will need to sharpen its
focus, take advantage of available resources, and rely increasingly on
its partners for support as it elevates its response to these dual
pressures. It will have to address these challenges while it is also
called upon to respond to growing pressure to address congestion,
emissions, and social equity. No easy task.

for the opportunity to testify on Incident Command System for
Industrial Control Systems, ICS4ICS.
My name is Megan Samford. As the Advisory Board chair of

Lastly, I am cochair of the U.S. Department of Homeland

My background in emergency management dates back to 2007,
when I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University as one
of the first 50 individuals in the United States with a
bachelor of arts degree in homeland security and emergency
preparedness. From there, I worked under Governors Tim Kaine
and Bob McDonnell, lastly serving as Virginia's critical
infrastructure protection coordinator. Most recently, and what
I am happy to testify on today, I became one of four
cybersecurity first responders to be formally credentialed as a
type 1 cyber incident commander under the FEMA National
Incident Management System Incident Command System.
The private sector lacks a consistent, repeatable, and
scalable framework to respond to day-to-day cyber incidents, as
well as cyber incidents where the impact spans suppliers,
customers, and coordination with local, State, and Federal
Government. This is due to a lack of interoperability of
individual company response plans. In the event of a large-
scale cyber incident, this deficiency can lead to poorly
executed responses that have impacts on lives and property.
The goal of ICS4ICS is to identify how the private sector
can adopt portions of the FEMA Incident Command System to
ensure coordinated, uniform, and more effective cyber incident
response. Implementing ICS4ICS at scale will help the United
States more effectively coordinate response and recovery
efforts, especially for critical infrastructures.
Together with members from DHS and the National Labs, the
ISAGCA and its member organizations such as Schneider Electric,
Honeywell, Johnson Controls, and Mandiant have established a
fully volunteer public-private partnership to deliver the
ICS4ICS framework. The success of the program thus far
indicates that it provides value for both the private sector,
as well as Government.
In a little over a year from its standup, the program has
proven that it is possible to apply the NIMS Incident Command
System framework to cyber incident responses in the private
sector, credential and type cyber incident response roles into
a common response structure, similar to fire and emergency
services, as well as create draft common response templates to
speed up responses and reduce error. This is especially
critical when responding to events like ransomware attacks, as
was the case with Colonial Pipeline.
Poorly managed cyber incident responses can be devastating
to our national security, safety, and economy. Even after 20
years, many of the same response challenges that faced
emergency responders on 9/11 continue to be challenges for us
now, except in cyber incident response--lack of common response
frameworks and interoperability.
With so much at stake, we must effectively manage cyber
incidents together, with both the private sector and
Government. The Incident Command System allows us to do so. The
effort is ramping up quickly and deserves a home in the United
States Government. On behalf of the ICS4ICS effort, I
respectfully request your bipartisan support for this important
program, in requesting that the Government investigate ways to
expand the spirit of language captured in Homeland Security
Presidential Directive 5, which directed public-sector adoption
of Incident Command System, to now encourage adoption within
the private sector.
Additionally, we respectfully request that Congress make
the necessary plans and investments for the private sector to
become trained and credentialed in Incident Command System and,
lastly, that ICS4ICS be operationalized as an official
Government program residing in the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security or another entity, if appropriate.
Thank you so much for your time today and your
consideration. I look forward to answering any questions you
all may have.

Abstract
The private sector lacks a consistent, repeatable, and scalable
framework to respond to day to day cyber incidents as well as cyber
incidents where the impact spans partners, suppliers, customers, and
coordination with local, state, and federal government. In the event of
a large-scale cyber incident, this deficiency can lead to poorly
executed responses that have impacts on lives and property.
The goal of ``Incident Command System for Industrial Control
Systems,'' which we refer to as ICS4ICS, is to identify how the private
sector can adopt portions of the National Incident Management System
(NIMS) Incident Command System (ICS) to ensure coordinated, uniform and
more effective cyber-incident response.\1\ Implementing ICS4ICS at
scale will help the United States more effectively coordinate cyber
incident response and recovery efforts within the private sector,
especially for critical infrastructures.

The success of the program thus far indicates that it provides
value for both the private sector as well as government. This is
evidenced by the number of daily, active volunteers, contributed by
both the private sector and government. In a little over a year from
its creation, the program has proven that it is possible to apply the
NIMS Incident Command System framework to cyber-incident responses in
the private sector, credential and type cyber-incident response roles
into a common response structure (similar to fire and emergency

up responses and reduce error. This is all being done on volunteer time
because the membership of this understands how badly the lack of
scalability in cyber-incident response is hurting industries both in
the United States, as well as globally.
While we are pleased with the rate at which the program is growing
through the ISAGCA, we recognize that to make it adoptable at scale, we
need the bi-partisan support of this Congress in developing a path for
the program to be transitioned to operations within the United States
government.

closely integrating private sector response capabilities was in an
article I published in 2014 titled, ``Framework for the Integration of
Emergency Support Function, Infrastructure Protection and Supply Chain
Management Efforts'' which aimed to describe how the private sector
could ``hook into'' local, state, and federal disaster response efforts
through integration with state level Emergency Operation Center
Emergency Support Functions (ESFs).\3\ As such, the effectiveness and
efficiency of coordinated responses between the private and public
sectors has been a focus area of my work for nearly the past decade.

Today, I hope to tell you what the ICS4ICS program is, why the
United States government and private sector needs it, and why this
effort needs a home in the United States government to scale.
What is ICS4ICS?
ICS is a standardized, repeatable, and scalable approach to
managing both day-to-day and complex incidents. It was created here in
the United States during the 1970s as a result of the California
Wildfire responses, where multiple fire departments and state and
federal agencies had come together to respond in a unified and
coordinated way.\4\ ICS has been tested in more than 40 years of
emergency and nonemergency applications by all levels of government and
in the private sector. At its foundation, ICS recognizes a need for
different organizations to work together toward common goals.

October 28, 2021, from https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/
documents/ICS100.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ICS addresses:

Nonstandard terminology among responding entities

Lack of capability to expand and contract as required

Lack of an orderly, systemic planning processes

Nonstandard & nonintegrated communications

Lack of personnel accountability, including unclear
chains of command and supervision

No common, flexible, predesigned management structure
that enables commanders to delegate responsibilities and manage
workloads efficiently

In preparing for this testimony, I found the below expert from the
United States Department of Agriculture Incident Command System 101
Course material to be very helpful in plainly explaining what Incident
Command System is.

``The Incident Command System or ICS is a standardized, on-
scene, all-risk incident management concept. ICS allows its
users to adopt an integrated organizational structure to match
the complexities and demands of single or multiple incidents
without being hindered by jurisdictional boundaries. ICS has
considerable internal flexibility. It can grow or shrink to
meet different needs. This flexibility makes it a very cost
effective and efficient management approach for both large and
small incidents. Designers of the system recognized early that
ICS must be interdisciplinary and organizationally flexible to
meet the following management challenges:

Meet the needs of incidents of any kind or size

Be useable or repeatable for routine or planned
events such as conferences, as well as large and complex
emergency incidents

Allow personnel from a variety of agencies to meld
rapidly into a common management structure

Provide logistical and administrative support to
ensure that operational staff, such as Forensic investigators
and malware reverse engineers, can meet tactical objectives

Be cost effective by avoiding duplication of
efforts'' \4\
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

The above chart explains the five basic management functions within
ICS: Command, Operations, Planning, Logistics, and Admin/Finance. As
incidents expand, additional sub structures can be broken out to
support scaling incidents. The functions apply in both small- and
large-scale incidents.
A key principle within the application of the management functions
is span of control. No one leader can have more than seven people
directly reporting to them to ensure span of control. This helps to
ensure accountability and reduce confusion during responses.\4\ Of
note, is that as incidents contract, the organization can scale down
accordingly, until only a few responders remain to support the
incident.\4\
Since its early adoption in the 1970s, to its full adoption across
the public sector today through the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), the Incident Command System has saved thousands of lives,
businesses, and property; has been endorsed by the United Nations; and
now, the most developed countries in the world follow this system for
emergency management.\5\ Every local fire, EMS, state agency, and
federal response entities in the US follow and know ICS by heart--it's
simply how we respond.

and-health-professions/incident-management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally, many private sector organizations now use ICS to run
day-to-day operations, planned events, as well as responses because of
its proven effectiveness in safety critical environments. This is
particularly common within electric utility companies. ICS has been a
gift to the world and the United States should be proud of this proven
response framework.
The Private Sector Cyber-Incident Response Problem--Scaling &
Interoperability
Having worked in product security programs for nearly a decade, I
speak from experience when I say that while individual companies may
have a cyber response plan, or ``playbook'' as they are commonly
referred, that is robust and effective, these plans often suffer during
larger crisis because of a lack of coordination capacity that can scale
outside of their organization, and their control.\6\ Each plan is
unique to the organization and defines who does what within the
organization, notification procedures, technical team capabilities,
interaction with legal and communications, and regulatory
requirements--the playbooks are comprehensive, but written on a
company-by-company basis and lack interoperability. Existing
cybersecurity standards do not specifically address a larger response
framework concept like ICS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

you need them? APMG International. Retrieved October 28, 2021, from
https://apmg-international.com/article/what-are-cyber-incident-
response-playbooks-why-do-you-need-them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The breakdown with this planning approach occurs when the response
is larger than one organization. The individual plans cannot scale
effectively into a collaborative response when multiple companies,
jurisdictions, and government entities need to be brought to bear for a
large-scale attack scenario. The Solar Winds supply chain attack
highlights the trend that cross-company, cross-sector, multiple party
responses are on the rise. Currently, there is no repeatable and
consistent framework to support cyber-incident response
interoperability among the stakeholders.
What Are the Larger Impacts of not Having a Common Framework?
The larger impacts for both the private sector and the government
of not having a common framework are that disasters can become
catastrophes when the responses cannot be contained. The consequences
of not having a structure like ICS4ICS can lead to inefficient and
costly responses, both for life and property due to a lack of a common
response framework.
From my observations, for the private sector:

There lies an inability for responses to scale outside of
one or two organizations. No larger structure exists for the private
sector to share resources through mutual aid agreements.

There is no standard terminology, ``common language'', or
common response templates. Common language and templates help to speed
up responses and lessen confusion. Lack of communications
interoperability was cited in the Implementing Recommendations of the
9/11 Commission Act of 2007.\7\

(n.d.). Retrieved October 28, 2021, from https://www.congress.gov/110/
plaws/publ53/PLAW-110publ53.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are no ``typed'' cyber-incident responder roles.
Typing is a way of characterizing roles so that they are shared across
a function. Example: A Type 1 Incident Management Team in Virginia has
essentially the same training and experience as a Type 1 Incident
Management Team in California. This creates baseline capability and
understanding and is a foundational premise of Incident Command System.

The private sector playbooks are based on traditional
enterprise information technology and are focused on tactical actions
needed to mitigate harm to the organization, gather evidence, and
determine what internal and external escalations/notifications are
needed.

Time and resources are not well tracked or managed
resulting in response fatigue, and hindered decision making over
extended operational periods. Surge capacity is rarely available to
provide relief, which also compounds response fatigue.

From my observations, what this in turn means for the government
is:

Out of the many defined natural and man-made disaster
types, cyber is the only disaster type that currently does not follow
Incident Command System.

If 85% of critical infrastructures are owned and operated
within the private sector, the US government lacks a way to effectively
coordinate under a common structure with a large percentage of its
cyber response resources.

There is a lack of understanding of the degree of cyber
expertise and capability the private sector could bring to bear.

If you take the example of the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack,
the asset owner and operator had detected ransomware on the enterprise
network and made the decision to safely shut down pipeline operations
to prevent the potential spread of the ransomware into that safety
critical environment. For all intents and purposes, this was a
responsible decision given the information available to decision makers
at that time. What we see in this scenario is that the major impacts of
the attack occurred not from the inherent ransomware attack, but from
the cascading impacts of proactively shutting down the pipeline. Again,
``disasters become catastrophes when responses cannot be contained''.
While shutting down pipeline operations was the appropriate and
safe decision, the cascading impacts of that decision meant the
response became less centralized because other impacted organizations,
such as the United States Department of Homeland Security, were brought
in to support the response. While I was not personally involved in the
response and remediation efforts, it can be inferred from the aftermath
that a unified public and private coordination structure could have
resulted in increased public confidence over the response. The lack of
public confidence and trust contributed to reactionary demand for gas,
resulting in shortages.
While the Colonial Pipeline example demonstrates how large
responses can scale, even for mature and well-resourced organizations,
in many cases, smaller organizations face even larger resource
constraints. A system like ICS4ICS can help companies provide mutual
aid to one another. This is not unlike how electric utility companies
share lineman during power restoration efforts following hurricanes.
You frequently see lineman from Dominion Energy based in Virginia
support hurricane recovery efforts in Florida. As such, the electric
utilities are also investigating the use of ICS4ICS: Sharing resources
is a well understood concept for that industry.
The Idea of ICS4ICS
Given these critical gaps and my past experience as an emergency
manager, I had the idea to apply the NIMS Incident Command System
framework and train cyber-incident responders in the same way we train
every other first responder in the United States. I put pen to paper
and drafted a cyber-incident coordination framework that could be
applied to cyber-incident responses based on Incident Command System.
After I introduced the ICS4ICS idea at one of the largest
Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity conference in the world, the
ISAGCA agreed to pick up the effort and it has grown: We now have
training programs on ICS4ICS, have updated response templates, and we
are educating cybersecurity experts on the framework.
Approach of ICS4ICS in Delivering Cyber Response Capability to the
Private Sector
Through ICS4ICS we are encouraging member organizations to start
adoption by overlaying this organizational structure over their current
response playbooks. We are not suggesting that ICS4ICS become a
replacement for existing response playbooks; instead, the Incident
Command System should be applied as a higher-level way of structuring
command and control as well as management of resources. The typing of
resources is also significant as it enforces common terminology and
expectations for each typed role.
Currently ICS4ICS has over 350 cyber volunteers registered to
become credentialed--most within the United States but there has been
increasing interest from cyber security experts in Europe, Canada,
Latin America, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. These international
groups will likely stand up their own local implementation and
credentialing processes. To become credentialed, a cyber-incident
responder must:

Submit an application to ICS4ICS

Create an account through FEMA's One Responder system

Complete 18 hours of online FEMA ICS training (the
courses may be able to be shortened at a later date)

Complete the Position Task Book application clearly
demonstrating where the applicant has obtained experience working
cyber-incidents (a third-party verification is required to be filled
out by a former supervisor or person in an authority role for the
described cyber-incident)

Once the application is completed, the applicant will receive
notice of the opportunity to appear before the ICS4ICS adjudication
committee (includes a representative from DHS CISA) to discuss their
application and answer any questions the adjudication committee may
have. Once approved, the credential is assigned and documented within
the FEMA One Responder portal.
Below is an example template that can be used by the private sector
when organizing a response in an Operational Technology (OT)
environment:
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

The next phase of the program will include continued creation of
response plan templates, hazard specific annexes to support events like
ransomware, Incident Action Plan templates, and needed credentialing.
DHS will also need to decide if private sector companies with trained
cyber-incident responders should integrate into the current NIMS, state
multi-agency coordination center (MACC) model, or if a centralized
office should be created within DHS.
Closing
Poorly managed cyber-incident responses can be devastating to our
national security, health and safety, and economy. Even after twenty
years, many of the same response challenges that faced emergency
responders on 9/11 continue to be challenges for us now, except in
cyber-incident response--lack of common response frameworks and
interoperability. With so much at stake, we must effectively manage
cyber-incidents, together, with both the private sector and government.
The Incident Command System allows us to do so.\4\
This effort is ramping up quickly and deserves a home in the United
States government. On behalf of the ICS4ICS effort, I respectfully
request your bi-partisan support for this important program in
requesting the government investigate ways to expand and enhance the
spirit of language captured in Homeland Security Presidential
Directive-5 to encourage adoption of Incident Command System within the
private sector for cyber-incident response:

``The Federal Government recognizes the role that the private
and nongovernmental sectors play in preventing, preparing for,
responding to, and recovering from terrorist attacks, major
disasters, and other emergencies. The Secretary will coordinate
with the private and nongovernmental sectors to ensure adequate
planning, equipment, training, and exercise activities and to
promote partnerships to address incident management
capabilities.'' \8\

Additionally, we respectfully request that Congress make the
necessary plans and investments for the private sector to become
trained and credentialed in Incident Command System in the same way
that fire and emergency services are trained today, and lastly, ICS4ICS
be operationalized as an official government program, residing in the

the opportunity to address such an important subject on behalf
of America's railroads.
Across the industry, railroads and the organizations that
support them take their role as critical infrastructure
underpinning the U.S. economy very seriously. In all efforts,
the commitment to safety is paramount. This commitment applies
with equal strength to our comprehensive and collaborative
effort in cybersecurity.
The key point we hope you take away today is this:
railroads have a proven and longstanding commitment to
collaboration within our industry, across sectors, and with
Government to protect against cyberattacks. The underlying
premise is that prevention is attainable with the right
structures supporting the right people armed with timely and
actionable cyber threat intelligence and security information.
We can prevent attacks and mitigate their effects, should they
occur.
The right people with the experience--cybersecurity
professionals and railroads, deeply familiar with their
networks and operations, who bring expertise and judgment to
bear in planning, protective measures, and collaborative
efforts. They ensure those fundamental measures outlined by the
chairman earlier are taken consistently and effectively.
Serving as a focal point for the industry's unified effort
is the Rail Information Security Committee, the right structure
formed by major freight, railroads, and Amtrak more than two
decades ago. Comprised of chief information security officers
and cybersecurity leads for railroads and industry
organizations, the committee focuses continuously on addressing
cyber threats, incidents, and significant security concerns.
What are we seeing?
Sharing effective practices and protective measures, what
we are doing about it.
Coordinated cyber incident response planning, how we work
together, effectively.
Benchmarking cybersecurity posture against the NIST
cybersecurity framework, continuous attention to how we can get
better.
Working with key industry suppliers in a dedicated joint
coordination and information-sharing group, how we strive to
detect and act upon vulnerabilities and concerns before they
can be exploited.
And engaging proactively with Government departments and
agencies of the United States and Canada, how we support
informed vigilance and effective action across sectors.
The industry, as a whole, benefits from the expertise and
shared experience, accomplishments, and priorities of network
protection for safety and operational resilience.
In support of this vital work, a top priority for our
industry is maximizing effectiveness through information
sharing. Reports by railroads and industry organizations is a
linchpin for this effort. These reports are made to the Railway
Alert Network, which works with the reporting railroad to
produce a cybersecurity advisory on the activity of concern,
describing how it manifested, what the indicators are, and what
measures should be taken to narrow risk profile. Through this
network we disseminate these advisories widely, among freight
and passenger railroads in the United States and Canada, and to
hundreds of recipients and fellow Government organizations,
including CISA, TSA, the FBI, DOT, the Department of Defense
commands, and Transport Canada.
Further, meeting a commitment we made at the inaugural
Transportation Sector Cybersecurity Tabletop Exercise held by
TSA in August 2015, we shared with the advisors and
representatives of each of the transportation modes and other
critical infrastructure sectors, and we have done so
consistently for more than 6 years now.
Unfortunately, what we have not seen is consistency in
analyses of the reports we have submitted to Government
organizations. And we believe these efforts can and should be
enhanced, and are committed to working with Government for this
purpose.
The overall aim remains consistent: get the right
information through the right structures to the right people to
make a difference. Government action should foster these proven
collaborative efforts in order to expand them and enhance them,
not override or disrupt them.
The President specifically urged this caliber of
collaborative effort in his National Security Memorandum on
Improving Cybersecurity, issued in late July of this year. The
railroad industry supports the President's approach and desired
outcomes. We sought to attain them in a third proposal
submitted to TSA in mid-August on enhancing cybersecurity
posture across the transportation sector.
However, in early October, the Secretary of Homeland
Security announced that TSA will issue security directives to
mandate cybersecurity actions by railroads and rail transit
agencies. These mandates are not only unnecessary, but also
could prove counterproductive, disrupting well-established and
proven practices. Railroads are meeting the main mandates the
planned directives will impose, but the prescriptive elements
for each raise serious concerns that what we have done so well
and for so long, in partnership with Government, will be
undermined. We must avoid a command-and-control approach, and
instead build upon an impressive track record of collaboration.
My written statement to the committee outlines
considerations for legislative action on cybersecurity, on
which I am happy to address questions this morning. But two
points merit emphasis here.
First, Congress has already acted effectively through the
Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015. This statute is
vastly underutilized by security agencies and Government. It
should not be, for it expressly authorizes sharing of cyber
threat intelligence and related security information within
industries, across sectors, and between industry and
Government. It also provides essential protections that build
and alleviate impediments to the flow of timely and actionable
information. Had this statute been effectively implemented, it
would not be even a perceived need for new legislation or
security directives on cyber incident reporting.
And second, the gap in analysis of reporting of significant
cybersecurity concerns should be resolved, closed, by expanding
the analytical capabilities of systems workforce before any
more mandates requiring more reporting are made. CISA Director
Jen Easterly testified earlier this week, emphasizing her view
that her agency's most effective role is in support and
collaboration for sustained enhancements across sectors of
cybersecurity posture. Legislation should enable accomplishment
of this admirable purpose.
In closing, we are proud that we have been proactive,
effective, and collaborative for so long in this challenging
arena. Policymakers here and executive agencies play an
important role alongside private enterprise. Creating nimble
and effective--without concerns for liability or enforcement
action and financial penalties for business is vital.
As Congress considers new measures, please look to build
upon the collaborative approach that has largely succeeded to
date. Thank you, and I am very happy to address any questions
you may have this morning.
[Mr. Farmer's prepared statement follows:]

Thomas L. Farmer, Assistant Vice President-Security, Association of
American Railroads
On behalf of the members of the Association of American Railroads
(AAR), thank you for the opportunity to offer this testimony. AAR's
freight railroad members account for the vast majority of North
American freight railroad mileage, employees, and traffic. Passenger
railroad members include Amtrak and several major commuter carriers as
well.
Railroads are indispensable to our nation. They connect producers
and consumers of goods across the country and the world, expanding
existing markets and opening new ones. Whenever Americans grow
something, mine something, or make something; when they send goods
overseas or import them from abroad; when they eat their meals or take
a drive in the country, there's an excellent chance freight railroads
helped make it possible. Passenger railroads enhance mobility and
connectivity, alleviate highway and airport congestion, reduce
pollution, promote local and regional economic development, and improve
transportation safety.
Unified Commitment to Security Preparedness, and Continuous Improvement
Railroads and rail industry organizations address both cyber and
physical security through unified efforts under a longstanding
comprehensive security plan. Applying a risk-based and intelligence-
driven approach to rail security, this plan has four alert levels that
call for increasingly stringent security measures.
Responsibility for managing the security plan and assuring its
sustained effectiveness to meet evolving threats is vested in two
dedicated industry coordinating committees: the Rail Security Working
Committee, which is comprised of senior law enforcement and security
officials focused on domestic and international terrorism; and the Rail
Information Security Committee (RISC), which consists of the chief
information security officers and information assurance officials of
major North American railroads, with support from security experts at
AAR and the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association
(ASLRRA). The rail industry, through RISC, has maintained a dedicated
and effective coordinating forum for cybersecurity protection and risk
mitigation for more than two decades. Together, the two committees
constitute the Rail Sector Coordinating Council (RSCC), which serves as
the rail industry's main channel of communication and coordination with
government agencies on cyber and physical security and preparedness.
Because of the devoted work of these committees, the rail
industry's security plan does not just sit on a shelf, occasionally
taken down and dusted off. Rather, it is a living document, evaluated
and enhanced continuously through recurring exercises, integration of
effective practices, and frequent consultations with government and
private-sector security experts to ensure maximum sustained
effectiveness in the face of evolving security threats. Early in 2020,
the two industry committees completed the most substantial review and
update of the plan since its inception some 20 years ago. This update
highlighted the substantial progress the industry has made in terms of
capabilities, monitoring and analysis of threats, coordination with
government agencies, electronic reporting, and joint decision-making on
alert levels, measures, and actions.
Railroads Address Cybersecurity Head On
Railroads of all kinds rely on advanced software and information
technology in every aspect of their operations. These technologies run
the gamut from advanced train dispatching software to smart sensors
along tracks that identify equipment in need of repairs, and from real-
time shipment tracking tools to sophisticated train control technology.
Railroads recognize their critical importance to our nation, as
well as the risks associated with their extensive reliance on
information technology, which is why they are continuously on guard
against cyberattacks and working diligently to enhance their
capabilities to guard against them. Railroads' cybersecurity efforts
are comprehensive, multi-faceted, and supported by specialized, highly
skilled cybersecurity staff.
A recent report by the Congressional Research Service rightly
concludes, ``Cybersecurity is a risk management process rather than an
end-state. It involves continuous work to (1) identify and (2) protect
against potential cybersecurity incidents; and to (3) detect; (4)
respond to; and (5) recover from actual cybersecurity incidents.''
Entities ``may choose to evaluate their information technology (IT)
risks by understanding the threats they are susceptible to, the
vulnerabilities they have, and the consequences a successful attack
might have for their mission and their customers.'' \1\ The rail
industry consistently focuses on these priorities through unified,
multifaceted, and proactive cybersecurity efforts.

Background and Issues for Congress,'' September 29, 2021. Available at
https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46926.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rail Industry Cybersecurity Efforts Span Two Decades
For railroads, cyber awareness is a fundamental component of their
day-to-day operations, but even the best cybersecurity plans and
practices will falter if useful information on cyber threats is not
shared. Information sharing allows organizations to learn from one
another, reduce their vulnerabilities, and quickly adapt to changing
conditions. For this reason, railroads and industry organizations
prioritize proactive engagement with government partners to share
information on cyber threats and effective countermeasures. Insights
gained from risk assessments and threat advisories, along with
experience gained in drills, enable railroads and industry
organizations to incorporate effective safeguards and protective
measures into their own systems.
The rail industry focuses on analyzing four categories of
protective measures: the tactics most commonly employed to gain illicit
access to computer systems; vulnerabilities most commonly exploited;
indicators of illicit activities most often noted in post-incident
analyses that were missed or disregarded; and protective measures that
could have made a difference if they had been implemented. We use these
four categories based on experience best demonstrated by the Australian
Cyber Emergency Response Team (CERT), which found that the vast
majority of the cyberattacks against private entities in which CERT
provided aid would not have been successful if the targeted entity had
paid sufficient attention to these four protective measures.
Further steps that the rail industry has taken to enhance timely
information sharing, in coordination with partners at DHS, FBI, TSA,
and DOT, include:

Deploying secure telephone equipment to connect major
railroads, the AAR, and government officials.

Sharing classified information with authorized Canadian
railroad officials who hold security clearances issued by the
government of Canada.

Establishing a classified information sharing network
with TSA, which enables authorized rail industry personnel to review
relevant materials in dozens of metropolitan areas nationwide.

Participating in a multi-industry initiative with DHS to
establish a secure video teleconference network that simultaneously
links more than 40 U.S. metropolitan areas.

As a result of these cooperative efforts between industry and
government, what had often required weeks, or even months, of effort
can often now be accomplished in hours. This progress greatly enhances
the ability of those in the private and public sector to identify and
effectively respond to cyberthreats in a collaborative manner.
The President Urges Government-Industry Collaboration on Cybersecurity
The rail industry supports the President's emphasis on government-
industry collaboration to enhance cybersecurity as laid out in the
National Security Memorandum on Improving Cybersecurity for Critical
Infrastructure Control Systems, issued on July 28, 2021.
In response to the memorandum, the rail industry developed a
detailed proposal on how government and industry can work
collaboratively to elevate cybersecurity posture in all transportation
modes. We submitted this to TSA just three weeks after the memorandum
was issued and more than a month before TSA's initial outreach to
stakeholders regarding Security Directives to mandate cybersecurity
measures by railroads and rail transit agencies.
Work on this initiative began over two months earlier in the wake
of the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack. In early June 2021, AAR's
security lead joined his colleague at the American Public
Transportation Association (APTA) to propose a ``strategic concept''
for enhancing cybersecurity in the transportation sector. Over the next
couple of months, the rail industry took the lead in drafting this
strategic concept.
Submitted in mid-August, the industry proposal delineates 13 areas
of emphasis that outline actions for transportation organizations and
federal government organizations to take to implement TSA's
Cybersecurity Roadmap. TSA Administrator David Pekoske has frequently
cited the Roadmap as defining ``clear pathways'' for enhancing
cybersecurity posture and mitigating cyber risk in the transportation
sector. Additionally, the rail industry's August proposal covers
recommend conduct of cybersecurity self-assessments, something on which
TSA plans to issue a non-compulsory information circular.
Unfortunately, although the rail industry's strategic concept
proposal was submitted in August and meets the President's repeated
emphasis on collaboration to enhance critical infrastructure
cybersecurity, we have received no official response.
TSA Security Directives Are Unnecessary
As members of this committee know, in public remarks about a month
ago, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas announced that
TSA will issue Security Directives laying out cybersecurity actions and
measures that must be implemented by ``higher-risk railroad and rail
transit entities.'' In making this announcement, Secretary Mayorkas
said, ``There is no better example of how the cybersecurity threat can
impact our lives than in the transportation sector and how people
commute, see one another, engage with one another.''
Railroads and industry organizations certainly agree that the
cybersecurity threat merits priority attention--as demonstrated by the
rail industry's rigorous attention to this issue for more than 20
years. Significantly, each of the actions the Secretary said will be
covered by TSA security directives for railroads and rail transit
agencies is already covered by the rail industry's August 2021 proposal
noted above. Put another way, railroads are already doing what they
should be doing in terms of cybersecurity.
Moreover, issuing a Security Directive is an exercise of emergency
authority by the TSA Administrator that allows imposition of
requirements ``immediately in order to protect transportation
security.'' \2\ Railroads and rail industry organizations have not been
advised by federal officials of any prevailing emergency conditions
that justify use of this authority, despite the many opportunities
available. TSA officials have indicated that work to produce and
provide a current cyber threat briefing is ongoing, but to our
knowledge no briefing has been proposed or scheduled for this purpose.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ 49 U.S.C. Sec.  114(l).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition, the Security Directives could undermine the 20-year
effort of the industry to develop and share cybersecurity information
among railroads and government agencies, as explained above. If reports
are required to be made to government and are deemed security-sensitive
information, then private industry stakeholders may be reluctant to
share the information through our established network. This outcome
will ultimately have a deleterious effect on the security of the
industry and the purported goal of these proposed Security Directives.
Lastly, the announcement of the Security Directives has produced
erroneous perceptions that railroads, and rail transit agencies, have
not been rigorously and effectively engaged for many years in defending
against cyber threats. This false impression could have negative ripple
effects if rail customers and the communities in which railroads
operate lose confidence in railroads' ability to operate safely and
securely.
Railroads' cybersecurity efforts are far more likely to be
effective if they involve continued collaborative efforts with
government than if they are mandated through top-down security
directives or rulemakings. To that end, our concerns are as follows:

The requirement that the appointed primary and alternate
cybersecurity coordinators be U.S. citizens will make compliance by two
major Canadian railroads (CN and Canadian Pacific) that also have
substantial U.S. operations extremely difficult. Given that TSA and the
rail industry have long successfully shared classified information with
Canadian nationals who hold security clearances issued by the
government of Canada, this prescriptive measure is unwarranted.

The mandate to report a ``cybersecurity incident'' is
overly broad and, if left unchanged, will result in high volumes of
reports on matters that are not significant from a cybersecurity
perspective. The directive should focus instead on ``significant''
cybersecurity incidents so that developing threats and effective
preventive measures can be more readily identified.

The inflexibility of an overriding government mandate of
risk-based determinations on preparedness and response planning,
protective measures, and implementing capabilities.
What Future Cybersecurity Legislation Should Include
As noted above, information sharing is crucial to the success of
all cybersecurity plans. The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of
2015 (CISA 2015) expressly authorized sharing of cyber threat
intelligence and related security information and created a framework
of protection to facilitate and encourage such exchanges within
industries, across critical infrastructure sectors, and with federal
government entities. Unfortunately, many of the authorizations and
protections Congress established in CISA 2015 have either been
inconsistently utilized or left unimplemented.
Policymakers should build upon the collaborative approach described
in this testimony and that has worked effectively for years, rather
than implementing mandates that would needlessly disrupt existing
organizational structures and practices that prove their value daily.
In this regard, freight railroads respectfully suggest that the
following elements should be included in future cybersecurity
legislation:
1. Include the reasonable protections provided in CISA 2015.

Antitrust exemptions, civil liability protections, and
other protections (Division N-CISA 2015; Secs. 104(e), 105(d));

Disclosure law exemptions, such as freedom of information
statutes, open meetings laws, or similar enactments requiring the
disclosure of information or records at the state, federal, and tribal
or territorial levels (Division N-CISA 2015; Sec. 104(d)(4)(B)(ii));
and

Certain regulatory use exemptions, which prevent any
federal, state, tribal, or territorial government from bringing an
enforcement action based on the sharing, but not the development or
implementation, of a regulation (Division N-CISA 2015; Sec.
104(d)(4)(C)(ii)).

Together, these provisions provide reporting entities with the
protections and confidence needed to sustain the unencumbered flow of
cybersecurity information with government authorities. Including these
protections in all future cybersecurity legislation will build upon the
successful partnerships CISA 2015 has formed.
2. Expand the analytical capabilities of the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) workforce.
Private sector entities, including railroads, already report
significant cybersecurity incidents and security concerns to CISA and
other federal government agencies. A persistent challenge, raised often
by private sector entities with federal partners, is the lack of
analysis of the reports by the government. Given the breadth of the
reporting mandate in the planned Security Directives for railroads and
rail transit agencies, the volume of reporting to CISA will increase
substantially. CISA must have the capacity to review, evaluate, and
analyze reports received from railroads and rail transit agencies.
Feedback should focus on why the reported activity matters to those
transportation organizations and what can be pragmatically done in
order to narrow future susceptibility. The lack of this focused
analysis and feedback to transportation sector entities indicates that
CISA may lack staffing and resources to meet this need.
3. Direct CISA to regularly update a cyber threat profile based on
analyses of attacks, failed attempts, and successful
disruptions.
This profile should focus on the following parameters:

Tactics most commonly used to perpetrate breaches;

Vulnerabilities most frequently targeted and exploited;

Protective measures most often found lacking or
inadequately implemented that could have prevented incidents; and

Indicators of developing threats that are often missed or
misunderstood.

The aim is to build understanding of how prevailing cyber threats
materialize and the measures most effective to prevent them or
seriously mitigate their adverse effects. The profile should undergo
constant review to enable updates on a quarterly basis. Organizations
across sectors and industries would contribute to the development of
this profile through reporting on significant cyber threats, incidents,
and indicators of concern and on measures or actions taken for risk
mitigation.
4. Direct CISA and Sector Risk Management Agencies (SRMAs) to work with
private entities to establish early notification networks.
The importance of cyber-attack analyses rests in what they yield,
which are discernible indicators that assist in identifying the illicit
activity that took place. Consistency in identifying and sharing these
indicators in a timely and efficient manner is crucial to prevent and
mitigate future attacks. Early notification networks provide an
effective means for proactive, streamlined, and continuous sharing by
governmental and private entities of these types of indicators based on
trust and shared interests.
5. Define and publicize procedures for stakeholders to submit requests
for information (RFIs) and requests for assistance (RFAs) to
enhance cooperative cybersecurity efforts.
As part of cyber preparedness plans, as well as in the wake of a
cyber-attack that affects a particular entity or industries,
organizations across sectors use RFIs and RFAs to gain insights based
on federal analyses of cyber threats and risk mitigation measures.
Timely responses can make prevention attainable. Unfortunately, CISA,
Sector Risk Management Agencies (SRMAs), and other federal components
lack consistency regarding submission, review and consideration, and
responses to RFIs, RFAs, and proposals for action to enhance
cybersecurity. Ad hoc processes are applied. These can vary
substantially with the type of incident, the information or action
sought, and the federal government organization that takes
responsibility for acting on the request or proposal. The result is a
lack of response or an action that fails to meet the stated needs or
reasonable expectations.
6. Direct CISA to establish consistent standards for software bills of
materials (SBOM) from vendors and suppliers
A recurring theme in the evaluation by CISA of cyber-attack
campaigns over the past year is the exploitation of vulnerabilities in
software that end users could not detect. To redress this gap in
cybersecurity awareness, CISA has repeatedly urged end users to ask
their suppliers to provide a software bill of materials that provides
an inventory list of all open source/third-party components present in
the source code used to build a particular software system,
application, or software or component. Legislation should transition
CISA's recommended measure and define consistent and effective
practices for vendors and suppliers of information technology. Proven
supported equipment, devices, and components need to produce sturdy
software bills of materials and make them available or accessible to
their buyers and end users.
The railroad industry, TSA, and CISA share a common purpose:
ensuring that effective and sustainable measures are in place, and
regularly reviewed for continuous improvement, to mitigate risk in the
face of evolving cyber threats. Railroads have a proven track record of
cooperative engagement with federal agencies, and we firmly believe
that collaborative effort is the best way to achieve this aim. We
should be afforded the opportunity to do what the President so rightly
urges in his National Security Memorandum.
Thank you again for the opportunity to present this testimony. When
it comes to cybersecurity, railroads have been proactive, effective,
and collaborative for many years. They will continue to work
cooperatively with private and public entities to ensure that our
nation's rail network and the people, firms, and communities it serves,
remain protected.

Mr. DeFazio. OK, thank you, Mr. Farmer.
Mr. Stephens?
Mr. Stephens. Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Crawford,
and distinguished members of the committee, good morning. My
name is Michael Stephens. I am the general counsel and
executive vice president for information technology at Tampa
International Airport. We thank you for the opportunity to
participate in today's hearing, and to offer the aviation
perspective.
More than 2.9 million passengers travel through America's
airports each and every day. The five largest U.S. airports
alone have more passengers flowing through them than the entire
population of the United States.
U.S. commercial airports are connected, critical
infrastructure ecosystems that are essential not only to our
Nation's economic prosperity, but to our national security.
The aviation industry accounts for more than 5.2 percent of
our national GDP and supports nearly 11 million jobs.
The aviation sector, like other sectors represented here
today, faces significant challenges from persistent and
increasingly pernicious cyber threats. In short, digital code,
computers, and keyboards have become the newest tools of
criminals, and the preferred weapons of war for nation states
and other U.S. adversaries.
It is my opinion that cybersecurity threats, without
question, represent the most persistent danger to the safe,
secure, and efficient operations of U.S. airports in the global
aviation system. And while there is no silver bullet or perfect
defense against cybersecurity threats, there are numerous
critical activities that can be undertaken by key stakeholders
to increase our overall cybersecurity preparedness and
resilience.
For the purpose of this hearing, I have distilled my
remarks down to four key areas.
First, the mandatory adoption of minimum cyber standards.
Although aviation and airports and other sector stakeholders
have engaged in building and achieving various levels of cyber
maturity, there are currently no significant requirements for
adherence to minimum baseline standards or preparedness
frameworks. Given the growing threat environment, the aviation
sector has approached an inflection point, where voluntary
cyber compliance is simply no longer adequate. I believe
significant consideration should be given by aviation sector
regulatory agencies to mandating the adoption and periodic
testing of established cybersecurity standards and resiliency
frameworks.
Second, the timely and effective sharing of information and
threat intelligence is essential to assessing and mitigating
cyber vulnerabilities. Consideration should be given to
mandatory disclosure of critical and actionable cyber incidents
that meet an agreed-upon threat threshold, irrespective of
whether or not the incident resulted in an actual data breach
or system compromise.
Third, we must close the human factors gap. Notwithstanding
the most effective standards, technological defenses, and
threat sharing efforts, the human factor remains the most
highly exploited vector for penetrating cyber defenses.
The aviation sector has taken cybersecurity seriously and
continues to implement processes to enhance cyber awareness and
security. However, the depth and the quality of training can
vary significantly, depending upon the entity. Requiring the
adoption of baseline standards, which establish minimum
training requirements for critical aviation sector employees
should be given significant consideration.
And finally, we must dramatically increase our national
focus on workforce development in order to build our cyber
defense capacity. In short, we are losing the race for talent.
In the U.S., we have a critical shortage of cybersecurity
talent with essential skills, such as security and network
engineers and software developers. These types of skills are
absolutely necessary in order to increase our cyber resilience
capabilities. The scarcity of these types of skills represents
a significant risk to U.S. competitiveness and security.
As the use of current and future technologies increases to
support airports, airlines, and other critical aviation
systems, the threat of disruptive cyberattacks will undoubtedly
increase, as well. The need for additional Federal assistance,
information sharing, workforce training, and the adoption of
baseline standards are all essential to our national security
and long-term economic prosperity.
Again, we thank you for the opportunity to testify before
you today, and I look forward to answering any questions that
you may have.
[Mr. Stephens's prepared statement follows:]

Michael A. Stephens, General Counsel and Executive Vice President for
Information Technology, Hillsborough County Aviation Authority, Tampa
International Airport
Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and distinguished members
of the Committee thank you for the opportunity to participate in
today's hearing on the critically important topic of understanding and
mitigating cybersecurity threats to our nation's critical
infrastructure.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), more than
2.9 million passengers travel through America's airports each and every
day. Based on some of the most recent available data, US airports
facilitated the shipment of more than 44 billion pounds of cargo. In
total, our nation's airports, along with our airline partners and all
other aspects of the US aviation industry, account for more than 5.2%
of our national GDP, contribute $1.6 trillion in total economic
activity and support nearly 11 million jobs. By any standard, airports,
particularly our commercial airports, are incredibly complex, connected
critical infrastructure ecosystems that are essential not only to our
nation's economic prosperity but to our national security as well.
The size and scope of operations, as well as the passenger volume
activity in our nation's airports, are vast. The FAA classifies the
nation's 30 largest airports by passenger volume as large hub airports,
of which Tampa International is in that category. Out of those 30
airports designated as large hubs, the largest five have more
passengers flowing through them on an annual basis than the entire
population of the United States.
As with most industries in order to meet the increasing demand and
needs of global commerce and the traveling public, airports, along with
our airline partners, have increasingly relied on technology both out
of operational necessity and to enhance passenger safety, security and
convenience. The ubiquitous use of technology has made airports,
airlines, and aviation more efficient and has undergirded and
facilitated the tremendous growth of global mobility, commerce, and
connectivity.
In today's modern and technologically advanced airports, there are
virtually no areas or functions that do not interface with or rely on
some level on a digital network, data transfer, computer application,
or internet interface. Virtually all functions essential to airport
operations and aviation safety and security, such as access controls,
navigation, airfield lighting, communications, industrial system
controls, and emergency response systems, rely heavily on a multitude
of technology applications and platforms. Moreover, airport information
systems contain or process tremendous amounts of sensitive data such as
passenger manifests, security plans, and data containing financial and
personally identifiable information (PII).
The operational importance of these systems, coupled with the fact
that they are increasingly supported and connected through networks
that rely on global technology supply chains, makes airports immensely
appealing targets and increasingly vulnerable to criminal organizations
and state-sponsored bad actors.
Airports, airlines, and the aviation sector, like other industries,
face significant challenges from a persistent and increasingly
pernicious cyber threat environment. Imagine, if you will, the
potentially dire consequences of a successfully coordinated major
cyber-attack on any one or more of our large hub airports, airlines, or
the Air Traffic Management System. The potential resulting national and
international disruption, economic harm, erosion of safety, and
degradation of vital aspects of our national defense capability would
be enormous.
In short, computers, keyboards, and digital code have become the
newest tools of criminals and some of the preferred weapons of war for
nation-states and other US adversaries. That is why it is of paramount
importance that we exercise increased urgency and vigilance to
anticipate, identify and mitigate cyber threats to our nation's
airports, airlines, and other critical aviation infrastructure. Given
the nature of these existing and growing threats, proactively
implementing standards, protocols, and countermeasures to protect
ourselves against potential catastrophic system disruption must become
one of our highest priorities.
While there is no silver bullet or perfect defense against
cybersecurity threats within the aviation industry or any industry for
that matter, there are critical activities that we must undertake to
increase our cyber resilience and mitigate as much risk as possible.
For the purposes of this hearing, I have distilled my remarks down to a
few critical areas that I believe present the best opportunity for
airports along with our airline partners and aviation sector
stakeholders to achieve greater preparedness, responsiveness, and
resilience.
Mandatory Minimum Standards
Under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA),
which defines a comprehensive framework to protect government
information, operations, and assets against natural or man-made
threats, Federal agencies are required to adopt and implement a
national baseline standard for cybersecurity preparedness. In 2013,
President Obama issued Executive Order (EO) 13636, Improving Critical
Infrastructure Cybersecurity, which called for the development of a
voluntary risk-based cybersecurity framework that is ``prioritized,
flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective.''
Subsequent executive orders and recent Presidential Directives have
also been issued to address and respond to the ever-changing
cybersecurity threat landscape and strengthen the requirements by
Federal agencies for ensuring and maintaining a baseline level of
preparedness.
Although airports, airlines, and other aviation stakeholders have
engaged in building and achieving various levels of cybersecurity
capability, maturity and resilience, there are currently no significant
requirements for adherence to a minimum baseline set of standards for
preparedness. According to a 2015 survey of airports in the United
States by the Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP) in its
Guidebook on Best Practices for Airport Cybersecurity, only nine out of
twenty-four (34%) airport respondents indicated that they had
implemented a cybersecurity standard or framework. Even assuming that
the percentage has increased, given the voluntary nature of
implementing a standard within the industry, there is no meaningful way
to assess adoption, adequacy, or consistency.
Moreover, according to a 2018 SITA Air Transport Cybersecurity
Insights report of aviation industry participants, only 41% of
respondents identified cybersecurity as part of their top
organizational risks. Only 42% of respondents planned to include cyber
risk in their organizational critical risk assessments in 2021. Fewer
than 35% of the responding organizations had a dedicated Chief
Information Security Officer (CISO), which is essential to raising
cybersecurity resilience as a priority to most executive and governance
levels.
Given these numbers, I believe that the aviation sector is at an
inflection point in the growing threat environment where voluntary
compliance is no longer adequate. This position is clearly evidenced by
the increasing sophistication and adverse impact on our economic and
national security from attacks such as SolarWinds and Colonial
Pipeline. It is my opinion that strong consideration should be given by
Congress and regulatory agencies such as the FAA and TSA to mandate the
adoption and implementation of minimum baseline cyber security
standards and frameworks throughout the aviation sector. The National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Framework for Improving
Critical Infrastructure for Cybersecurity, for example, provides
substantial guidance for establishing a minimum cyber resilience
framework for the aviation sector and other critical infrastructure
sectors.
Such a baseline cybersecurity framework would not replace an
existing cybersecurity program that an organization already has in
place. The framework would be used to augment, enhance and strengthen
any existing program and align it with best practices for greater
coordination and effectiveness throughout the aviation industry. For
airports, airlines, and key stakeholders that do not have a baseline
cybersecurity program, such a requirement would ensure a minimum level
of readiness and facilitate the development of more effective sector
cyber preparedness and maturity.
Cyber Security Information Sharing & Communication
While one of the stated objectives of EO 13636 focused on
increasing information sharing between the government and the private
sector, it has not been as effective as it could be due to the
program's voluntary nature. The sharing of information and threat
intelligence is a critical component to assessing airport and aviation
sector vulnerabilities, enhancing our preparedness posture, as well as
giving airports and our airline partners the ability to respond more
effectively and recover in the event of a cybersecurity incident.
Often information sharing practices within the aviation sector have
been reactive versus proactive. Voluntary information-sharing programs
have demonstrated utility when reacting to and recovering from a cyber-
incident when shared in a timely manner. However, the exponentially
growing threat landscape will require significantly more investment by
the public and private sectors both nationally and internationally.
In order to strengthen information sharing, consideration should be
given to requiring mandatory disclosure of cyber incidents that meet an
agreed-upon threat threshold irrespective of whether or not the
incident resulted in an actual data breach or system compromise. The
information reporting and sharing requirement should focus on
actionable threats and risks in order to minimize the data and
information overload, or the creation of information ``white noise''.
Laws such as the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) and
related programs such as the DHS Cyber Information Sharing and
Collaboration Program (CISCP), if coupled with the implementation of
mandatory minimum standards within the aviation sector, may help to
accelerate the progress of information sharing and collaboration.
However, mandating a minimum baseline common standard and enhancing
opportunities to share critical cybersecurity threat intelligence in a
timely manner within the aviation and across other critical
infrastructure sectors will ultimately result in the greater national
capability to combat cyber security risks.
Information Security Awareness Training and Workforce Development
Closing the human factors gap is a critical and integral part of a
successful and effective cyber resilience strategy within all critical
infrastructure sectors. Notwithstanding the most effective program
standards, technological cybersecurity defenses, and threat
intelligence information-sharing efforts, the human factor remains the
most highly exploited vector for penetrating cybersecurity defenses
within the aviation sector. In a recent study by Airports Council
International (ACI) of key aviation leaders and stakeholders, 87% of
the respondents reported that social engineering attacks were the
leading vector of cyberattacks.
Cybersecurity threat awareness and information security training
programs for all airport, airlines, and aviation industry employees is
perhaps one of the most efficient and cost-effective ways of increasing
cybersecurity preparedness in the aviation sector. The NIST ``Framework
for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity'' (NIST 2014)
specifically indicates that cybersecurity awareness and training is a
critical and indispensable component to an entity's overall
cybersecurity program.
Airports, airlines, and the aviation sector take cybersecurity
seriously and have implemented creative processes to educate staff and
tenants to further enhance cyber awareness, hygiene and security.
Numerous resources are increasingly being made available for
cybersecurity training at the federal, department, and state level.
According to the survey of airports in the United States by the Airport
Cooperative Research Program (ACRP), 20 of 27 (74%) of the responding
airports indicated that they engage in some form of employee
information security training.
However, due to the multitude of differences within airport
governance and organizational structures, the scope, depth, and quality
of training may vary significantly from airport to airport. Numerous
additional factors may also adversely impact the quality and breadth of
training, such as availability of budgets particularly in a post COVID
environment, lack of available subject matter expertise and adequate
buy-in from senior management in prioritizing spending on resiliency
efforts.
To combat the exponential growth of cyberattacks, we must make
significant investments to develop cyber literacy and equip people with
the necessary tools to detect and defend against bad actors. This will
require efforts beyond typical awareness training and would ideally
build on aviation's physical safety-and-security culture to develop a
cybersecurity culture across all industry stakeholders.
Adopting and requiring a uniform standard which establishes a
minimum baseline training requirement for airport, airlines and other
aviation sector employees on a defined and reoccurring basis should be
given significant consideration by the appropriate aviation sector
regulatory agencies such as the FAA and TSA.
Workforce Development
We are losing the race for talent. Professionals, specifically
within the aviation industry, with critical cybersecurity skills and
competencies are in scarce supply. In the US, we have a critical
shortage of cybersecuritylent such as software engineers, software
developers and network engineers. By some industry estimates, the US
currently has a shortage of more than one million security experts, and
that number is expected to grow significantly over the next decade.
These essential skills are necessary to increase our cyber resilience
and response capabilities
d represent a significant risk to US
national security and competitiveness.
We must invest in building future cyber capacity by identifying and
recruiting highly sought-after talent and developing and retaining our
current cyber workforce. In order to close the cybersecurity skills
gap, substantial national public and private efforts should be
undertaken to develop and expand the capabilities of current and future
workforces. Particular focus should be placed on developing cyber
competencies through high school and university education programs
promoting science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and foreign
language (STEM-L).
Conclusion
Our nation's airports, airlines, and other critical aviation
infrastructure rely heavily on information technology and complex data
networks to support the growing demands of our economic, strategic, and
national security interests. As the adoption of current and future
technologies increases to support the aviation sector both here and
abroad, the threat of disruptive cyber-attacks on airports, airlines,
and critical aviation information systems and data will undoubtedly
increase as well. Evolution towards a more effective, non-voluntary
cyber risk mitigation strategy against this pernicious and imminent
threat must be undertaken proactively and with a renewed sense of
urgency. The need for increased assistance, improved regulatory
oversight, and the urgent adoption and implementation of a baseline
cybersecurity protection framework and standard for information sharing
and workforce training are essential to the nation's security and long-
term economic prosperity.

Mr. DeFazio. Thank you for your testimony, Mr. Stephens,
and now we would move to John Sullivan.
Mr. Sullivan, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Sullivan. Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Crawford,
and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to
testify on cybersecurity challenges facing the Nation's water
and wastewater infrastructure. I am John Sullivan, chief
engineer of the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. I am also
chair of the Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or
WaterISAC, and deliver my testimony today in that capacity.
WaterISAC is a nonprofit organization established in 2002
by the national water and wastewater associations at the urging
of EPA and the FBI to provide utilities with critical
information on physical and cybersecurity threats, and best
practices for prevention and response. WaterISAC member
utilities currently serve 206 million people across the United
States, about 60 percent of the U.S. population. While EPA and
Congress provided some funding to get the service up and
running in the early 2000s, today member dues payments support
100 percent of the WaterISAC's budget.
We know that water and wastewater utilities pose attractive
targets for cyberattackers. My written testimony references
several recent cyber intrusions against water and wastewater
systems that occurred last year, targeting utilities across the
country. Perhaps best known is the attack early this year
against the water utility serving Oldsmar, Florida. While
utility staff immediately observed the breach and took
corrective action that prevented any impacts to water quality
or public health, it is easy to imagine how the outcome could
have been much worse.
For example, consider an attack that infiltrates the
industrial control systems of a wastewater system, and disables
the treatment train or the pumps that move sewage from one part
to another. This could result in the release of large amounts
of sewage into rivers and streams, harming the natural ecology
of the receiving waters, creating a public health nuisance, and
potentially contaminating sources of drinking water.
The Boston Water and Sewer Commission had its own
experience with a cybersecurity incident last year in the form
of a ransomware attack. While it complicated the day-to-day
business and was costly to recover from, there was never any
threat to public or environmental health, due to precautions
such as our business network being segregated from our control
systems. This is a best practice in any sector that uses
industrial control systems, but this approach is not consistent
across the Nation's 16,000 wastewater systems and 50,000
drinking water systems.
With such a large universe of water systems across the
country, many are bound to have a lack of understanding of
these cyber best practices, or a lack of expertise and
equipment to implement them. This is where the WaterISAC can
help. In Boston's case, the center was instrumental in our
recovery from our incident, as it referred us to a firm
specializing in ransomware incident response, which helped us
navigate our way through the events.
More broadly, WaterISAC offers resources such as 15
security fundamentals for water and wastewater utilities, a set
of best practices for the protection of information technology
and industrial control systems. The 15 fundamentals provide
straightforward, but sometimes overlooked, tasks like enforcing
user access controls, performing asset inventories, addressing
vulnerability management, and creating a cybersecurity culture.
As the committee conducts oversight of cybersecurity at
wastewater utilities and other critical infrastructure
entities, we recommend an approach that provides more resources
to both wastewater systems themselves and to the EPA in its
capacity as the sector risk management agency for the water and
wastewater sector. These resources could come in the form of
technical assistance programs to help medium and small
wastewater systems implement technology upgrades and secure
external services; initiatives to expand the reach of the Water
Rights Act to all wastewater systems nationwide; and assessment
assistance and training to help wastewater systems comply with
best practices.
One promising approach can be found in the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act. One provision in this bill would
encourage electric utilities to bolster their cyber
preparations and would seek to increase participation in the
electricity information sharing and analysis setup, WaterISAC's
counterpart from the electric sector.
A similar direction for EPA to take steps to bolster water
sector participation in the Water Rights Act, especially among
the wastewater systems serving fewer than 100,000 people, would
help get threat information and best practices into more hands
across the country.
We would be happy to work with you on this effort. Thank
you for the chance to testify today, and I am happy to answer
any questions.
[Mr. Sullivan's prepared statement follows:]

John P. Sullivan, P.E., Chief Engineer, Boston Water and Sewer
Commission, on behalf of the Water Information Sharing and Analysis
Center
Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and members of the
committee: I appreciate the opportunity to appear at today's hearing on
``The Evolving Cybersecurity Landscape: Industry Perspectives on
Securing the Nation's Infrastructure.''
I am John P. Sullivan, and for many years I have served as the
Chief Engineer of the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. The Commission
is the largest and oldest water system of its kind in New England and
provides drinking water and sewer services to more than one million
people daily. In addition, I currently chair the Water Information
Sharing and Analysis Center, better known as WaterISAC, and serve on
the Water Sector Coordinating Council, comprising the national water
and wastewater associations,\1\ which advises the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA) on their security programs. I am also a member of the
board of directors of the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies
and the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, and serve on the
Water Utility Council of the American Water Works Association.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The Water Sector Coordinating Council consists of the American
Water Works Association, the Association of Metropolitan Water
Agencies, the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, the
National Association of Water Companies, the National Rural Water
Association, WaterISAC, the Water Environment Federation, and the Water
Research Foundation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I testify today on behalf of WaterISAC, a non-profit organization
established in 2002 by the national water and wastewater associations,
at the urging of EPA and the FBI, to provide utilities with critical
information on physical and cybersecurity threats and best practices
for prevention and response. The designated information-sharing arm of
the Water Sector Coordinating Council, WaterISAC is the most
comprehensive and targeted single point source for data, facts, case
studies, and analysis on water security and threats from intentional
contamination, terrorism, and malicious cyber actors. WaterISAC member
utilities currently serve 206 million people across the United States--
about 60% of the U.S. population.
We commend the committee for holding today's hearing because
protecting the nation's critical infrastructure against a growing range
of cyber threats is an issue of increasing urgency. My testimony will
provide an overview of the cyber risks faced by water and wastewater
systems, the sector's response thus far, and what we can do looking
forward.
Water and Wastewater Systems' Cyber Risks
Water and wastewater systems are an attractive target for cyber
attackers, and the implications of an attack could be significant. This
is why water, along with transportation, energy, and communications,
are the four ``lifeline functions'' designated by the Department of
Homeland Security. This means that the operations of these sectors are
so critical that any disruption or loss will directly affect the
security of other critical infrastructure sectors as well.
However, it is important to distinguish between different types of
cyber-attacks that could target water and wastewater systems. The first
are attacks against utilities' information technology systems, also
known as business or enterprise systems. These include email systems,
websites, and billing databases. In recent years water and wastewater
systems have reported a variety of such attacks, which include
ransomware incidents, email compromise scams, and social engineering
and phishing attempts. And while these attacks, if successful, can
disrupt day-to-day business and compromise sensitive data, they, alone,
would not have any impact on the treatment or management of drinking
water or wastewater.
A more concerning type of cyber-attack would target a utility's
industrial control system. Industrial control systems operate treatment
processes, valves, pumps, and other utility infrastructure.
Last month EPA published a joint cyber advisory along with the FBI,
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and NSA outlining
``Ongoing Cyber Threats to U.S. Water and Wastewater Systems.'' \2\ The
advisory featured input from WaterISAC and summarized some common cyber
threats to water and wastewater systems, recommended mitigation
actions, and resources for systems to access. It also cited several
cyber intrusions against U.S. water and wastewater systems since last
year, including incidents affecting utilities in California, Maine,
Nevada, New Jersey, and Kansas. While none ultimately affected public
health or environmental quality, the growing number of incidents makes
clear that utilities must be prepared to defend against and respond to
these attacks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-
287A-Ongoing_Cyber_Threats_
to_U.S._Water_and_Wastewater_Systems.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the most-publicized recent cyber intrusions against a U.S.
water utility played out this past February at the drinking water
system serving the city of Oldsmar, Florida. In this case, an unknown
malicious actor infiltrated the city's water treatment plant and made
changes to chemical levels in the treatment process. According to the
Pinellas County sheriff, the attacker accessed a computer in the
treatment plant's control system using an application called
TeamViewer. A plant operator observed two intrusions that were hours
apart. In the second intrusion, which lasted about five minutes, the
operator saw the mouse moving around as the malicious actor accessed
various functions. One of these functions controls the amount of sodium
hydroxide in the water, which the actor changed from about 100 parts
per million to 11,100 parts per million. The operator in Oldsmar
observed this change and immediately reversed it.
If the intrusion had not been detected in real time, reports say
that it would have taken between 24 and 36 hours for the affected water
to reach the distribution system, and prior to that point it most
likely would have been detected by redundancies that are in place to
check water quality before release. But this incident is emblematic of
how bad actors can take advantage of cyber vulnerabilities that may be
present in many of the nation's roughly 50,000 drinking water systems
and 16,000 wastewater systems, and it is easy to imagine how the
outcome might have been far worse. What if, for example, the intruder
was not immediately detected, and was able to manipulate pumps to drain
a water tower or restrict distribution to certain areas? Such an
outcome not only would have undermined the public's confidence in their
water service but would have carried severe impacts on the community's
environmental, fire protection, and public health.
With wastewater systems, one danger is that an attack can disable
the treatment train or the pumps that move treated and untreated
sewerage from one point in the process to another. A successful attack
could release large amounts of sewerage into rivers and streams,
harming the natural ecology of the receiving waters, creating a direct
public health risk and also contaminating sources of drinking water.
It is important to recognize that organizations--from federal
agencies to large and small businesses--can implement every best
practice in the book and still suffer a cybersecurity attack.
Notwithstanding that nation states have sophisticated methods of
gaining unauthorized access to even the most secure systems,
compromises can also be caused simply by one employee clicking on a
malicious link in an email. So not only is it critical to implement the
best technologies, but it is also critical to educate employees and to
have incident response plans in place should attacks occur.
The Boston Water and Sewer Commission had its own experience with a
cybersecurity incident in the form of an Egregor ransomware attack last
year. While it complicated day-to-day business for many weeks and was
costly to recover from, there was never any threat to public or
environmental health, due to our business network being segregated from
our control system, among other precautions. This saved the utility
from suffering much greater impacts and is a best practice in any
sector that uses industrial control systems, but this approach is not
consistent across water and wastewater systems. This is likely due to a
lack of understanding, among many utilities, of its importance and a
lack of expertise and budget to implement it.
WaterISAC was instrumental in helping Boston Water and Sewer
recover from this incident. The center referred the utility to a firm
specializing in ransomware incident response, which helped us navigate
our way through the event. In situations such as these, WaterISAC has
access to a field of subject matter experts at other utilities and at
private firms that it can tap in support of its members.
Water and Wastewater Systems Cybersecurity: State of the Sector
We know there is more the water and wastewater sector could be
doing to prepare for cyber-attacks. According to a cybersecurity survey
on water and wastewater systems--2021 State of the Sector \3\--released
in June by the Water Sector Coordinating Council, adoption of cyber
best practices varies across the sector. For instance, the Council
found that while cybersecurity is an element of most utility risk
management plans, that is not the case for nearly 40% of respondents,
which included many systems serving less than 500 people, but in some
cases those serving hundreds of thousands. On the whole we found that
larger utilities--with more resources--have fewer challenges to
implementing cybersecurity practices, while many smaller utilities lack
funding and expertise.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sector Efforts to Improve Cybersecurity
One resource available to the sector is WaterISAC, established in
2002 with seed money from EPA and subsequent congressional
appropriations. A critical component of cybersecurity preparedness is
having access to the latest cyber threat and vulnerability information
and to best practices from subject matter experts. One of two dozen
other ISACs across critical infrastructure sectors, WaterISAC annually
issues hundreds of advisories, maintains a portal for members and hosts
webinars and threat briefings. The center also receives incident
reports and conducts threat analyses to help water and wastewater
utilities stay ahead of the threat curve.
In more recent years, in collaboration with EPA, through the
Government Coordinating Council, the water sector as a whole has
recommended that utilities implement best practices and has offered
resources to that end.
Among these is WaterISAC's free 15 Cybersecurity Fundamentals for
Water and Wastewater Utilities, a set of best practices for the
protection of information technology and industrial control systems.
First published in 2012 and most recently updated in 2019, the 15
Fundamentals provide straightforward but sometimes overlooked tasks
like enforcing user access controls and performing asset inventories.
Other recommendations in the guide address vulnerability management and
creating a cybersecurity culture.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ The complete list of 15 water sector cybersecurity
fundamentals, available at waterisac.org/fundamentals, consists of:
1.  Performing Asset Inventories
2.  Assessing Risks
3.  Minimizing Control System Exposure
4.  Enforcing User Access Controls
5.  Safeguarding from Unauthorized Physical Access
6.  Installing Independent Cyber-Physical Safety Systems
7.  Embracing Vulnerability Management
8.  Creating a Cybersecurity Culture
9.  Developing and Enforce Cybersecurity Policies and Procedures
10.  Implementing Threat Detection and Monitoring

12.  Tackling Insider Threats
13.  Securing the Supply Chain
14.  Addressing All Smart Devices
15.  Participating in Information Sharing and Collaboration
Communities
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another key sector resource is the American Water Works
Association's Cybersecurity Guidance & Tool, which is based on the NIST
Cyber Security Framework. The AWWA guidance offers a sector-specific
approach for implementing applicable cybersecurity controls and
recommendations and is widely used.
WaterISAC and the sector associations also promote EPA tools and
those offered by CISA, as well as small-system resources through AWWA
and the Department of Agriculture.
In terms of federal oversight of the sector's cybersecurity
drinking water and wastewater systems are not subject to the same
requirements. On the drinking water side, America's Water
Infrastructure Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-270) requires drinking water
utilities, under the oversight of EPA, to periodically take an ``all-
hazards'' look at potential threats, including risks to ``electronic,
computer, or other automated systems.'' This provides an opportunity to
evaluate potential threats and develop response measures. However,
there is no statutory requirement for wastewater systems to take
similar actions.
A New Approach to Water Sector Cybersecurity
Despite these differences, both water and wastewater systems are
implementing best practices to safeguard their information systems and
industrial control systems from attacks and fulfilling their missions
to protect public health and the environment. However, the water and
wastewater sector is large and diverse, and we see room for
improvement, as demonstrated by the State of the Sector report noted
above. The current approach could leave utilities vulnerable to
cybersecurity attacks that could endanger health and the environment.
One of the most effective ways for Congress to help the nation's
wastewater systems withstand cyber threats is to provide more resources
to both the systems themselves and to EPA in its capacity as the Sector
Risk Management Agency (Sector-Specific Agency) for the water and
wastewater sector. These resources could come in the form of technical
assistance programs to help medium and small wastewater systems,
additional grant funding to help individual wastewater systems
implement technology upgrades and secure external services, initiatives
to expand the reach of WaterISAC to all wastewater systems nationwide,
assessment assistance, and training to help wastewater systems comply
with best practices. Indeed, the State of the Sector survey cited
resources such as these among utilities' top needs.
One promising model could be based on provisions included in
Section 40125(c) of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This
proposal aims to improve the cybersecurity of bulk power systems and
would authorize $250 million over five years to support a new Energy
Sector Operational Support for Cyberresilience Program at the
Department of Energy. Among the objectives of this program would be
supporting efforts ``to expand industry participation in [Electricity]-
ISAC,'' the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center,
WaterISAC's counterpart for the electricity sector. Should the
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee develop legislation related
to cybersecurity in the wastewater sector, a similar EPA program aimed
at increasing participation in WaterISAC should be considered.
As previously mentioned, WaterISAC currently counts among its
members water and wastewater utilities that serve about 60% of the U.S.
population. Some members serve as few as 2,000 people, but most members
serve larger populations. However, only about 400 of the nation's
nearly 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 wastewater systems are
paying WaterISAC members that enjoy full access to all of the
nonprofit's threat and vulnerability alerts, subject matter expertise,
and other information.
Congress provided funding to get the center up and running in the
first decade of the 2000s, but since that time the center has been
funded exclusively through member dues. These dues are structured on a
sliding scale--beginning at $100 per year--so as to be affordable for
smaller utilities, but nevertheless many utilities are not able to take
advantage of the resources available. At the same time, many thousands
of utilities are simply unaware of WaterISAC. Unless more utilities are
part of WaterISAC, then lack of awareness of threats will prevail.
WaterISAC member utilities have more and better information with
which to build a security and resilience program than those that don't
belong to the center.
Therefore, federal assistance to underwrite membership fees for
small and medium-sized water and wastewater systems and a federal
program to increase awareness of the center would help get threat
information and best practices into more hands across the country. As
noted in the State of the Sector report, the greatest challenge for
smaller systems is awareness of threats and best practices.
We estimate that federal assistance at a level of just $6 million
over three years would enable WaterISAC to provide a broader array of
services to water and wastewater systems nationwide. Specifically, this
level of funding would be used to cover the cost of membership for
thousands of small and medium systems, expand our threat analysis
capabilities, conduct exercises and training, and offer technical
support to utilities.
Conclusion
WaterISAC appreciates the opportunity to share our views on the
cyber threat landscape facing the nation's water and wastewater
systems, and effective strategies to help utilities respond to these
challenges. I am proud of the work the water and wastewater sector has
done on its own to spread awareness of sound cyber practices, but
additional resources and assistance from the federal government would
go a long way toward ensuring the greatest number of water and
wastewater utilities are as prepared as they can be. We stand ready to
work with you to make this a reality.

Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Mr. Sullivan. And our last witness
will be Gary Kessler.
Mr. Kessler, 5 minutes.
Mr. Kessler. Thank you. Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member
Crawford, and members and staff of the committee, thank you for
the invitation and opportunity to speak today. I am Gary
Kessler, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council,
and one of the coauthors of the Council's report, ``Raising the
Colors: Signaling for Cooperation on Maritime Cybersecurity.''
I have spent my professional career since the 1970s in the
information technology and information security field. I am a
retired professor of cybersecurity, coauthor of a book on
maritime cybersecurity, and a principal consultant at Fathom5
working on cyber issues related to maritime operational
technology testbeds. I also hold a national office in the U.S.
Coast Guard Auxiliary Cybersecurity Division, and I am a
visiting faculty member at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.
Most people in the United States do not think of our
country as a maritime nation. They don't understand and
appreciate our Nation's reliance upon the maritime
transportation system, or MTS, for our very way of life. Our
report addresses that dependence in some very tangible ways,
from the $5.4 trillion contribution to the U.S. economy,
representing about 25 percent of our country's gross domestic
product, to the 30 million jobs.
Roughly 80 percent of global trade and nearly two-thirds of
the world's total petroleum and other liquid energy supply is
carried by ship. In the United States, approximately 90 percent
of our imports/exports move by sea, emphasizing the fact that
most global supply chains are existentially dependent upon
maritime.
Consider the disruption to the global supply chain caused
earlier this year, when Ever Given became stuck in the Suez
Canal, costing the global trading community nearly $9 billion
each day. Much closer to home, note the current disruption to
U.S. supply chains because of the backlog of the Ports of Long
Beach and Los Angeles, the entry for nearly 40 percent of U.S.
imports.
The ability to move military personnel and materiel by sea,
combined with the global presence of U.S. Navy warships and the
U.S. Coast Guard, are fundamental to U.S. military power
projection around the world.
The maritime transportation system is critical and poses
significant challenges to policymakers. The MTS is composed of
many independent, yet co-dependent and inextricably intertwined
systems representing ships, ports, shipping lines, inland
waterways, and intermodal transfers.
The system of systems metaphor speaks to the fact that the
maritime sector is not monolithic, where a single set of rules
or regulations can manage the industry. This provides a
particular challenge to legislators, regulators, and those with
administrative responsibility alike. Like the rest of the
industrial world, MTS stakeholders take advantage of new
technology, and this goes to the very heart of why we are here
today.
The modern computer age dates back only about 75 years.
Commercialization of the internet began a mere 30 years ago.
The acceleration of change in computing and communication
technologies is now almost beyond comprehension, and includes
advances in processors, sensors, embedded computers,
operational technology, cyber physical systems, navigation, big
data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. These
advances have led to the Internet of Things, smart ships and
ports, the Ocean of Things, automation and maritime systems,
and fully autonomous vessels.
Computer attacks that were almost unheard of 30 years ago
are commonplace today. Ships that barely had a computer on
board 25 years ago are now susceptible to cyberattack, even in
the middle of the ocean. Multiple sources report a sharp uptick
in the number of cyberattacks directed toward the MTS since
2019, including more than a dozen ransomware events in the last
18 months.
Cybersecurity has risen to become a significant threat to
the maritime sector, no less than the food security, energy
security, economic security, homeland security, and national
security of the United States are dependent upon the seas. The
maritime transportation sector is broad, diverse, and global,
so that, while international cooperation is essential, central
management is impossible. Cyber vulnerabilities are as
plentiful in the maritime sector as in the nonmaritime world
and provide unique threats to the industry.
The National Maritime Cybersecurity Plan was a clarion call
about a significant threat facing this country. Our report,
``Raising the Colors,'' was a first step at trying to provide a
tactical approach to addressing that threat. We have to
continue pushing forward to address this critical issue.
Thank you, and I look forward to your questions and further
discussion.

Gary C. Kessler, Ph.D., Nonresident Senior Fellow, Atlantic Council
Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and members and staff of
the committee--thank you for the invitation to provide testimony to the

United States Dependence Upon Maritime Transportation
Most people in the United States do not think of our country as a
maritime nation. They view our nation's waterways as a venue for
recreation or a vacation get-away, a source of food, or the home of 12
million recreational boats and pleasure craft. Our citizens, in large
part, neither know about nor appreciate our reliance upon the maritime
transportation system for our very way of life.
Our report addresses that dependence in some very tangible ways--
the maritime transportation system (MTS) contributes $5.4 trillion to
the U.S. economy, representing about 25% of our country's gross
domestic product, as well as 30 million jobs.\3\ Roughly 80% of global
trade and nearly two-thirds of the world's total petroleum and other
liquid energy supply is carried by ship. In the U.S., approximately 90%
of our imports/exports are by ship, emphasizing the point that no
global supply chain is independent of maritime transport, and most, in
fact, are existentially dependent upon it.

Consider the disruption to the global supply chain caused when the
cargo ship EVER GIVEN was stuck in the Suez Canal in March of this
year, costing the global trading community nearly $9 billion each day.
Although the blockage only lasted for six days, the 20,000-container
vessel did not leave the Canal area for nearly four months pending a
dispute with the Suez Canal Authority.\4\ Much closer to home, consider
the current disruption to the U.S. supply chain due to the backlog at
the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, the entry way for nearly 40%
of U.S. imports. There are myriad causes for the backlog but the
bottom-line impact is higher costs, delays in getting goods to market,
and global disruption of many product supply chains.\5\

The MTS is not Monolithic
While we often talk about the MTS as if it was a single, monolithic
entity, it is actually a system of systems, representing ships, ports,
shipping lines, inland waterways, and intermodal transfers.\7\ All of
these systems operate independently, yet are co-dependent and
inextricably intertwined. The life cycle of a ship, for example,
intersects with the lifecycle of a port and is only a part of the life
cycle of a shipping line. The life cycle of people and cargo within the
MTS intersect with a ship's voyage and transit through ports,
intermodal transfers, and inland waterways. The cybersecurity threats
to the MTS are similar to threats everywhere else in information space,
but are unique to our industry and way of life.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ports are one of the primary focus points of our report.
Intellectual property (IP) theft related to port operations and
construction can yield very valuable information to competitors and
adversaries, alike. The deliberate installation of a Stuxnet-type of
vulnerability \8\--i.e., software that can attack and destroy
hardware--into a vessel or vessel component during construction could
provide the basis for a ransomware or other cyber attack years later.

The adage, ``If you've seen one port, you've seen one port'' \9\ is
well-known in the maritime industry. All ports are unique in terms of
their ownership and management, the mix of civilian and military
vessels and operations, the interconnection of information and
communication technology (ICT) systems by port operators and tenants,
personnel management, intermodal connections, volume of traffic, cargo,
passengers, etc. While all ports have the same general functions, each
is unique.\10\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ships, another focus point of the report, are floating networks.
There are multiple operational networks onboard a vessel, including
passenger/entertainment networks, navigation systems, satellite
communications, ballast control, engineering control, propulsion and
steering, cargo management, and more. Global Positioning System (GPS)
and Automatic Identification System (AIS) communications are essential
to positioning, navigation, timing, and situational awareness, and are
both susceptible to jamming and spoofing.
Shipping lines are a business like any other business; they just
happen to own and operate ships. Thus, they have the same potential
information security vulnerabilities that any business does, from
finance and logistics to communications and cargo/passenger management.
There is a significant amount of third-party software and systems
employed by shipping lines, so the business is not even in charge of
all of their own computers and networks. Remember the havoc in
companies and governmental agencies around the world with the attack on
SolarWinds less than a year ago.\11\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intermodal transfers are where the MTS touch every other form of
transportation, including trucking, rail, and aviation. Even if the
port, ship, and shipping line have outstanding security, a cyberfraud
or cyberattack might still be perpetuated via a compromised trading
partner.
People are often the largest security attack vector, both in
physical space and cyberspace. People are our passengers, our workers,
our adversaries, our clients, and our colleagues. We need to vet the
people that are engaged in any way with the MTS, obviously at different
levels of access to information and systems. Cyberattacks on the
personnel or passport control systems, for example, can render the
ordinary security checks worthless, not to mention the enormous amount
of personally identifiable information (PII) and financial information
in the personnel and passenger databases.
Cyber security in the maritime sector is a very broad endeavor.
Regulation and administrative controls apply very differently to each
of the sector's sub-systems.
Technology Advances in the MTS
Technology in the MTS and cyber attacks go to the heart of why we
at the Atlantic Council issued our report. The beginning of the modern
computer age dates back only about 75 years. Modern digital
communications technologies date back to the 1960s. The beginning of
the global Internet started slowly just more than 50 years ago but,
once commercialized a mere 30 years ago, was adopted more rapidly than
any other technology in human history--at least up until that time.\12\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The acceleration of change affecting information and computing
technologies is now almost beyond comprehension and includes advances
in processors, sensors, embedded computers, OT, cyber-physical systems.
Digitization--the conversion of all forms of information into a binary
format--has provided the ability to store, process, analyze, and
integrate all sorts of information. This has led to the huge data sets
commonly known as big data, providing significant advances in machine
learning and artificial intelligence (AI).
Indeed, digitization of information and full integration of many
data streams has led to digitalization, the transformation that offers
an incredibly broad understanding of systems that heretofore was
impossible.\13\ As an example, the concept of a smart ship allows the
master of a vessel to be aware of almost every aspect about the state
of the vessel, from the speed, course, bearing, water temperature, and
salinity level to the stress on the hull, instantaneous fuel
consumption, cargo container status, and power generation levels. Smart
ports, the Internet of Things, the Ocean of Things,\14\ increased
automation in maritime systems, and fully autonomous vessels are a
direct result of this transformation within our knowledge base and AI
software. Taken all together, the combination of advanced ICT and smart
systems is driving Industry 4.0, or what is recognized as the fourth
industrial revolution.\15\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The drivers for this rapidly increasing level of intelligence
include safety and efficiency in operation. The majority of maritime
accidents are caused by human error, often due to fatigue; automated
systems can respond more quickly to unexpected events and a smart ship
is better able to anticipate events. In addition, more complete
knowledge of the state of the vessel can allow the officers to provide
more efficient operation and routing, which can lead to a lowering of
operation and fuel costs.\16\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
These data-driven systems, however, offer a larger cyberattack
surface than ever before. Computer attacks that were almost unheard of
30 years ago are commonplace today; ships that barely had a computer
onboard 25 years ago are now susceptible to cyberattack even in the
middle of the ocean. There has been a significant uptick in
cyberattacks targeting the MTS since 2019,\17\ including more than a
dozen ransomware attacks since early 2020. Cybersecurity has risen to
become a significant threat to the smooth operation within the maritime
sector.

Additional Thoughts and Considerations
The cyberthreat landscape to the MTS raises the question about the
role of government in helping improve the state of maritime
cybersecurity. The government's response to a physical attack is very
different than that of a cyber attack. If a foreign country were to
fire a missile at a private company within the U.S., for example, the
government would take the lead to track down the source and,
undoubtedly, respond militarily. Conversely, when foreign entities
launch cyberattacks against American companies, the government response
is essentially that the target is on their own.\18\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The MTS represents a concentration of cyber risk. In this context,
risk is a function of system vulnerabilities, exploits that can take
advantage of these vulnerabilities, and threat actors willing to use
these exploits to cause harm. The Vulnerabilities Trump Threats maxim
says that a cyberdefender needs to concentrate on vulnerabilities in
their systems because these are internal and manageable, rather than
focusing on threats because those are external and largely unknown.\19\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
One example of a significant vulnerability to the MTS are the
systems used for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT), and
situational awareness at sea. The primary source for PNT in maritime--
in fact, the primary timing source for all U.S. critical
infrastructures--is the Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS has been a
victim of jamming (i.e., blocking of the signal) and spoofing (i.e.,
sending false timing and location information) for some years.\20\ The
Automatic Identification System (AIS) is used for maritime situational
awareness. AIS information will be incorrect when bogus GPS information
has been received by a ship or an attacker can insert false information
into the system. Although it is of some value to know the Threat Actors
that might employ GPS or AIS spoofing, it is more important to fix or
augment the systems to be more resistant to the attacks in the first
place. This is an important role for government to play.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, regulators, administrators, and managers usually
respond to threats rather than vulnerabilities. New laws and funding
sources do not appear merely because a new vulnerability is discovered
but rather once a new threat is identified. This is a mindset that
needs to be re-examined.
We need the federal government to take a more active role in the
cyberdefense not only of the MTS, but of transportation as a whole.
Industry self-inspection has been cited as partial causes for the
Boeing 737 Max \21\ and EL FARO \22\ disasters. While neither of those
were cybersecurity incidents, both speak to the reduced involvement in
the inspection and compliance process by responsible government
agencies. This is not a question of big government versus small
government, but a close examination of the issues in order to determine
the appropriate level of government. In general, the level of an
agency's authority should match the level of its responsibility. The
USCG has the regulatory responsibility to protect the MTS from all
forms of threat, in both real space and cyberspace. They must be
provided with the necessary resources to carry out this vital mission.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another critical defensive tactic is related to intelligence
sharing. Cyber-related incidents, reports, and analysis must not only
be freely shared amongst all of the government regulatory agencies, but
between all MTS stakeholders that wish to participate. The maritime
entities most at risk are the small shipping lines, ports, cargo
handlers, and manufacturers that do not have the financial assets to
have a large information security team or join one of the industry
information sharing organizations. A central maritime security
information sharing center--such as Singapore's Information Fusion
Centre \23\--would go a long way to assisting the MTS in protecting
itself against new and emerging threats in both real space and
cyberspace.\24\

Maritime regulators also need to prepare better reporting
requirements about cyber-related events for information flow to the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Cyber and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA), and/or USCG, as well as a central location for
such reporting, and clearinghouse and reporting distribution center for
the industry.
Additionally, we have to recognize cybersecurity as a safety issue
in the maritime environment. The maritime industry prides itself on it
focus--and relatively strong record--on safety. But cyber safe
environments require excellent cybersecurity hygiene on the part of the
users and that requires regular training for all members of the
MTS.\25\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, the designers and builders of maritime systems that depend
upon any ICT or OT equipment need to have a mindset of security by
design. All too often, systems are protected by layering security on
during implementation rather than designing security into every device.
Indeed, a vessel network composed of a collection of secure devices
might itself not be secure; the network must be designed with security
in mind.
Conclusion
The United States is very much a maritime nation where our food
security, energy security, economic security, homeland security, and
national security are dependent upon the seas. The maritime
transportation sector is broad, diverse, and global so that, while
international cooperation is essential, central management is
impossible. Cyber vulnerabilities are as plentiful in the maritime
sector as in the non-maritime world and provide unique threats to the
industry. Both the commercial maritime industry and our military
maritime interests demand our proactive response to this ongoing
threat.\26\

The National Maritime Cybersecurity Plan was a clarion call about a
significant threat facing this country. Our report, Raising the Colors,
was a first step at trying to provide a tactical approach to addressing
that threat. We have to continue pushing forward to address this
critical issue.
Thank you again for the opportunity to provide testimony and
information for the committee. I look forward to your questions and
further discussion.

Mr. DeFazio. Thank you. With that, I will begin with
questions to the panel.
A major point of contention is--I guess there are two, it
is two issues.
One is reporting. And, for instance, Mr. Belcher, you
talked about 30 percent of transit systems you surveyed had
been the victim of cybersecurity, but they never reported the
incident. So, that is one issue, is reporting, whether or not
reporting should be mandatory. And what is the value of people
reporting? I would assume that there are many things to be
learned when someone reports, and we properly analyze, and they
report what the attack was. It may well benefit others in their
same sector of industry, whichever one of these sectors we are
talking about.
And secondly is the idea of whether or not there should be
a mandate. Now, I understand concerns about a very prescriptive
mandate. But a mandate that all critical sector organizations
have some sort of cybersecurity officer, or at least designee,
if they have very few employees among their staff, and that
they are sort of bird-dogging the people within their
organization.
So, I guess I would like briefly, if we could, each member
of the panel to just quickly opine on the value of mandatory
reporting, and a requirement that doesn't have to be totally
prescriptive, but you have to have someone designated for
cybersecurity within your organization if you are involved in
critical infrastructure.
So, any member of the panel who wishes to respond briefly
would be appreciated.
Mr. Belcher. I am happy to start. I am very comfortable
with mandatory reporting, and very comfortable with a
designated cybersecurity official. I recognize that--I mean, I
work with a large number of very small and mid-sized transit
organizations that do not have cybersecurity professionals. In
fact, they are lucky to have IT professionals.
Nevertheless, this is an important issue that is part of
something that they have to do. It is part of an enterprise
management issue. And I think one of the things that we have to
do, as we look at managing organizations, is to make
cybersecurity just part of the enterprise management, the
management of risk, and the management of security of the
organization.
And so, identifying somebody, whether it is an employee or
a consultant that is there and that can engage with TSA on a
24-hour basis, I think, is absolutely essential.
Mr. DeFazio. OK, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Belcher.
Anyone from any of the other sectors who wish to respond?
Mr. Stephens. Chairman, this is Michael Stephens from Tampa
International. I would echo that sentiment.
While I don't think that there is a problem with mandates,
we are not unfamiliar with mandates for reporting in the
aviation sector. For example, if you have an airfield incursion
that is not authorized, we have to report that. If you have an
[inaudible] airside incursion, we have to report that. So,
there is not a problem with reporting and mandates for
reporting.
The problem becomes, though, what are we reporting? Part of
the TSA proposed guidance that we have been providing comments
to is very, very broad-based, in terms of what is being
required to be reported. And information just for the sake of
information is not necessarily a good thing, because it leads
to information overload, and white noise, and a lot of times
gets ignored. So, I think, while reporting mandates are
appropriate, we have to tailor those to make sure that they are
actionable, as I said in my opening comment.
And then, secondly, I do believe that, if we have mandatory
minimum standards, baseline standards for cyber resilience, a
lot of those types of things that are falling through the
cracks--reporting, identification, mitigation strategies--will
start to be resolved.
So, I think that both of those things are things that we
need to do, but we need to do them in the right way.
Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, that was very valuable comment on
too much reporting of things that would not be of value.
And just----
Mr. Farmer. And Mr. Chairman, may I add to that, please?
Mr. DeFazio. Sure, quickly, yes.
Mr. Farmer. Thank you, sir. The key challenge here with the
reporting mandate that has been presented to us by TSA is just
what Mr. Stephens highlighted.
And CISA Director Jen Easterly, she has made a point to
emphasize that her agency is interested in signals, not noise.
And that is what we have been providing in the rail sector for
several years, dating back at least to the 2014-2015 timeframe.
We are providing them with information products that delineate
what happened, what a railroad observed, what the indicators
were, and what they did about it, in terms of a security
response, with recommendations that we share widely on measures
that other railroads can take.
And additionally, as I indicated in the opening statement,
we provide thoroughly to our partners, and other transportation
modes and sectors, and to Government.
And on the appointment of the coordinator, again, we don't
object to that. We have had [inaudible] coordinators for an
extended period of time. But the draft TSA directive has a
significant limitation. It requires U.S. citizenship. And the
challenge there is we have two major operations, railroads that
operate from Canada into the United States, CN and Canadian
Pacific. And they are going to have an extremely difficult time
meeting that standard, because their network operations, their
expertise, is in Canada.
What is really disconcerting here is we have put a lot of
effort in with TSA in working collaboratively to overcome
objections to a sharing of classified information with those
cleared staff in Canada, with clearances from Canadian
Government. And so, we just don't understand the basis for that
restriction, because it is really setting up two major freight
railroads for failure in meeting the future directive. Thank
you.
Mr. DeFazio. OK, thank you. That was very helpful. My time
is expired, and now I recognize Mr. Crawford.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This month it was
reported that TSA will soon issue mandatory security directives
for rail transit and, potentially, aviation.
Mr. Farmer, how much stakeholder engagement has TSA
conducted in advance of their release?
Mr. Farmer. So, there have been two outreaches from TSA,
where we have been provided drafts of the directives to provide
comments. In each case, they were done on a 72-hour response
timeline.
Mr. Crawford. Is that typical for TSA?
Mr. Farmer. When the decision is taken to issue a security
directive, the timelines are narrow.
We believe that there is a clear opportunity here,
consistent with the President's National Security Memorandum,
to collaborate on the content of the directives, so that the
disruptive effects that we see can be alleviated and avoided.
Mr. Crawford. The previous mandatory directives for
pipelines followed the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, if
you recall. What incident or security threats are necessitating
a mandatory security directive for freight, rail, or transit?
Mr. Farmer. Sir, we have not been apprised of any imminent
or elevated threat to railroads or rail transit agencies as a
justification for this emergency action. Nor are railroads
seeing the sort of activity that would be indicative of an
elevated, specific, persistent threat to rail.
Mr. Crawford. If you were apprised of such a threat, how
would that be communicated to you?
Mr. Farmer. We have well-established procedures with TSA
for sharing information. We have quarterly teleconferences with
their surface division. There is a group called the Surface
Transportation Security Advisory Committee that meets
quarterly. We have our Industry Cybersecurity Committee. The
Rail Information Security Committee convenes twice a month. So,
there are ample opportunities to communicate with us on an
unclassified level.
But we have taken it a step further. We have worked with
the agency to establish a secure video teleconference network,
so that they can deliver classified presentations up to the
secret level nationally, so that railroad cyber leads can
participate from locations in their headquarters' areas, and--
--
Mr. Crawford. So, there is a robust exchange protocol
already in place?
Mr. Farmer. Yes, sir, we have devoted extensive efforts to
creating a range of options to communicate information, both
unclassified and classified, up to the secret level.
Mr. Crawford. So, you are confident that, if there were
some threats to rail, you would be warned in a timely manner,
you would be aware of it, and that those communications
channels are open and available?
Mr. Farmer. Yes, sir.
Mr. Crawford. And you don't see any threat, or have not
been apprised of any threat that, to your mind, would warrant
the mandatory security directive that is being proposed by TSA
right now?
Mr. Farmer. Yes, sir. We have not been apprised of the
threat that is the justification for this emergency action
through any of those communications channels I have referenced.
I am based in Washington, DC. My colleague at the American
Public Transportation Association, as well. We can be read in
at the top-secret level. That initiative has not been taken.
In fairness to TSA, they have referenced that there is a
briefing being developed, and that it will be given. It has not
yet been scheduled.
But our concern is we have cybersecurity leads who, as part
of our industry protocol, our emphasis on cybersecurity, every
quarter, at board of directors meetings, cybersecurity is a
recurring subject, and they are being asked questions about
these directives, what the driving impetus is, and they can't
answer them because we have not been provided that detail.
Mr. Crawford. Let me ask you how you think the security
directive might interact with what you already have in place,
your current rail cybersecurity measures or reporting systems.
Mr. Farmer. On the reporting systems, sir, the key
challenge is the breadth of the definition of ``cybersecurity
incident'' is such that it is going to overwhelm what Director
Easterly at CISA wants to accomplish, and that is to get
signals that are indications of potential cybersecurity
concerns, significant cybersecurity concerns, as opposed to a
lot of noise.
Mr. Crawford. And you are afraid that this might just,
basically, create more noise, and it might be more difficult to
catch those signals.
Mr. Farmer. Yes, sir. And I think the challenge is--and it
is twofold--it is the breadth of the reporting protocol;
``cybersecurity incident'' is widely defined.
Secondly, the timeline. Initially, it was 12 hours, based
on input we provided. It has been extended to 24, and I think
many cybersecurity experts would tell you that it is very
difficult in that first 24-hour period to have insight into
whether what is taking place is actually significant, from a
cybersecurity perspective.
We have got the right experts in place, and they can
provide the right information.
Mr. Crawford. Yes, just real quick in the time I have
remaining, can you give us some ideas of some of the
cybersecurity practices that you have already adopted and
implemented in rail recently?
Mr. Farmer. Yes, sir. And the efforts in this area go back
more than two decades. That is how long we have had a
cybersecurity focus committee. And it is a continuous analysis
process of what the prevailing threats are, and what we can be
doing effectively to address them.
The committee provides a collaborative approach. We share
information on cybersecurity concerns. We share information on
effective practices. The chairman, in his opening remarks,
outlined a series of actions: multifactor authentication, the
conduct of assessments, action on those assessments, strong
passwords. Those fundamental measures are being taken.
I think, most importantly, no one is resting on laurels. We
take the NIST cybersecurity framework, and we assess our
cybersecurity posture against that framework at least every 2
years. And, based on the lessons learned, we focus on enhancing
our practices. And all the effort we are devoting to
information sharing is designed to make sure the right people
have what they need and can take the right measures to narrow
their risk profile and prevent harm from happening.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Farmer. My time has expired.
Ms. Norton [presiding]. Thank you very much. I now
recognize myself for 5 minutes.
Cybersecurity presents a fairly unique challenge to Members
of Congress: we're supposed to do something about problems,
recognizing, however, that there is no cure-all for
cybersecurity.
But Mr. Belcher, you discussed the need for carrots and
sticks to ensure the necessary resources are utilized by
transit and their agencies. You also mentioned the need for the
Federal Transit Administration to require organizations to
adopt and implement minimum cybersecurity standards prior to
receiving Federal funding.
I would like you to briefly explain the specific carrots
and sticks you would recommend the Federal Government use to
get transit organizations to the minimum cybersecurity
standards you see as urgently needed, Mr. Belcher.
Mr. Belcher. Sure. I would be happy to. So, Mr. Farmer
described a situation in the rail industry that is a little bit
different from the situation in the transit industry.
The transit industry has over 3,000 transit operators,
public transit operators, that range in size and
sophistication. And my experience with them is that they are
desperate for regulation, and they are desperate to be told
what to do. This is really an area where they don't know what
to do. And in fact, just yesterday I was speaking, and I had a
transit CEO ask me what they needed to do to secure their Zoom
calls. So that was the level of sophistication that they have
when it comes to cybersecurity. And this was a CEO. So, they
get the same briefings that Mr. Farmer talked about, but they
don't have the resources to do it.
So, you have a couple of things. You have a series of
agencies that are underresourced, and that have to manage, and
then, through the pandemic, have found their resources have
been stretched further. And so, they have a whole new series of
challenges facing them.
So, the carrots are to provide funds to support them, and
to provide them with tools to support them. And those tools are
contractual language, the tools are to provide them with
cybersecurity assessments. The large transit operators do get
resources, do get Federal funding, do get support from TSA to
do assessments, to do audits, to do cybersecurity plans, but
the vast unwashed do not. The small to midsized transit
agencies do not get funds for that, do not get that level of
support. So, those are the ones who really need it desperately.
They need that help.
And as it relates to what you can do with respect to the
agencies, I think you need to have the--before a transit agency
receives Federal money from the FTA, they need to certify that
they have a cybersecurity plan in place, because we found that
almost 50 percent of the agencies do not have a basic
cybersecurity plan in place.
Ms. Norton. Yes, well, that is really helpful, Mr. Belcher.
I am really interested in this issue.
You spoke about cyberattacks that already have involved
transit agencies in cities like New York, and places like
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Vancouver. Now, I represent the
District of Columbia. Many Members of Congress and their staff
use transit agencies here, so these cyber effects could have
very specific and harmful effects on Congress itself.
Can you discuss how the attacks have impacted average
citizens?
Mr. Belcher. Sure.
Ms. Norton. For example, have these disruptions, and the
huge increase, a 186-percent increase in ransomware attacks on
the transportation sector, generally, shown us the attack on
the average person using transportation?
Mr. Belcher. Yes, in a number of ways. One example is at
SEPTA, which had a major ransomware attack last year, or
earlier this year. SEPTA was forced to shut down its public
communication system, so it was not able to communicate with
its customers for almost 2 months, digitally.
A large percentage of its customers utilize mobile
applications to determine when their bus or their train was
going to arrive, and how to access it, and they pay for it with
a mobile application. They couldn't do that any longer. Many
customers go and look on a digital screen to see when their bus
is going to arrive. They couldn't do that any longer. They had
to go back to paper schedules, and so they were forced to do
that. So that is one example.
A second example is that, when a transit agency has to pay
out a ransom, which many of them do, first of all, they may be
insured once. Once they pay out a ransomware, the likelihood
that they are going to get insurance a second time is highly
unlikely. So, that is going to increase the cost of operations.
So, there are a variety of ways that people are impacted.
And then, third, it can impact the operations. The main
things we are concerned about right now are not the things that
you would think about, in terms of, like, the movie, ``Speed.''
That is what we all think about, is something is going to take
over, and take over a bus, or take over a train autonomously.
That is not why CEOs stay up at night--they are worried about
somebody taking over PII, the customers' or the employees'
personal information, or the operating system. And those are
the things that hackers are getting a hold of and that impact
passengers.
Ms. Norton. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Belcher.
I next call on Mr. Gibbs.
Mr. Gibbs. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Mr. Kessler, I want to ask some questions here about the
maritime industry. Is it inherently more difficult protecting
IT communications systems that are both worldwide and require
ship-to-shore communications?
Mr. Kessler. Are you asking if it is harder to secure
those?
Mr. Gibbs. Well, I am trying to understand the
complications of when you have got a shipping company that is
worldwide, that has ship-to-shore communications, do they
establish firewalls in their land base to the ships and just
how does all that relate, and how vulnerable are they to
cyberattacks, I guess.
Mr. Kessler. Well, they are as vulnerable as any other
remote communications.
One of the mechanisms that are used widely to talk to ships
is by VSAT, very small aperture terminals. And there have been
any number of studies and demonstrations, particularly at the
hacker conferences, about the fact that, when the communication
is coming back down, it is not directed at a ship, or even a
place on Earth. It is going to a total footprint on Earth, and
that makes it very easy for people to intercept those
communications, which are, in a large way, unencrypted.
And so again, the demonstrations at the hacker conferences
have shown all sorts of very interesting communications coming
between ships and back to shipping headquarters, or just in
internet access for passengers that are just sending emails
that are also invariably unencrypted. So that is one of the
unique communications problems we have on ships.
Certainly, the ships themselves are using firewalls. What I
believe we are going to see ongoing, as we get more and more
autonomous vessels and remote-controlled vessels, is the fact
that, if I am able to remotely access a vessel in order to
provide control, it is naive to believe that nobody else could
somehow also take over that communication.
Furthermore, when I get fully autonomous vessels, that
means we are going to have to change the collision regulations
or the maritime rules of the road. For example, you are
required to have a lookout on board a vessel. Well, if I have a
fully autonomous vessel, I can't have a lookout. So instead,
what I am going to do is have a whole bunch of cameras, and
they are going to be remotely monitored. That will suffice for
my lookout.
Well, again, if I can remotely access the cameras, then it
would be naive to believe that nobody else could break in and
look at the cameras, possibly change the contrast setting on a
camera so that the camera is now blind.
Mr. Gibbs. OK, let me----
Mr. Kessler. So those are some of the issues----
Mr. Gibbs. Let me--yes, let me just interrupt you, I am
running out of time. Autonomous vessels, that is more in the
future a little bit.
But I also was concerned--we had the malware attack on
Maersk in 2017. Can you tell us what specific steps maybe have
been taken by the shipping industry to mitigate future attacks?
And have we been more vulnerable with the crisis of the
supply chain, with all the ships being idled and backlogged?
Mr. Kessler. Well, very quickly, Maersk, of course, was
whacked quite hard by a ransomware attack for which they were
not a target. They were merely susceptible. And I believe that
that was, though, a wakeup alarm for the maritime industry.
However, as I said in my testimony, there were at least a
dozen well-known attacks in 2020 and 2021 that were directed at
the maritime industry. There have been at least two maritime
entities that have been hit by two ransomware campaigns during
that period of time. So, while the awareness has gone up, and
there has been positive responses, it seems that it continues
to be an ongoing problem.
Mr. Gibbs. So, we haven't really gotten any satisfactory
solutions to address it? Still kind of really vulnerable, is
that what----
Mr. Kessler. I think that the satisfactory solutions have
not been implemented, and some of those things have been
actually mentioned with some of the other sector speakers, as
well.
A lot of it is awareness training for everybody in the MTS,
because so many of these attacks occur because humans are
socially engineered.
Mr. Gibbs. OK.
Mr. Kessler. But at the same time, I would like to say we
have to stop throwing our hands up in the air and saying, ``oh
my goodness, it is the users,'' because that implies that we
are giving the users secure systems, to begin with, that the
people are somehow screwing up.
The fact is we are using operating systems that are not
secure. We have applications that are not secure. And you only
have to look at the number of patches that are coming out
constantly to demonstrate that we are working with systems that
are not as secure as they should be, which gives the users not
really a chance.
Mr. Gibbs. Thank you very much. I yield back my time. Thank
you.
Ms. Norton. I now recognize Mr. Larsen for 5 minutes.
Mr. Larsen. Thank you, Madam Chair.
My first question is for Mr. Stephens, if you could
prepare, Mr. Stephens.
The U.S. aviation sector is very complex. It is made up of
various entities and stakeholders responsible for different
aspects of it. Have you considered how the complexity of the
U.S. aviation system, though, then makes that system more
vulnerable to cyberattacks, or less vulnerable because of the
complexity?
How do you approach that?
Mr. Stephens. Oh, that is an excellent question,
Congressman. In a way, I think it makes it more vulnerable, and
here is why. I will give you an example.
The MTA attack that was mentioned earlier, it affects New
York, it could create delays. It can create some safety risks.
But it doesn't impact, maybe, the metropolitan transportation
system in San Francisco. However, a cyberattack in New York at
JFK, or one of the other major airports in that area, would
very well not only impact, because of the connectivity, the
airport in San Francisco, but across the globe, potentially.
So, it is much more global, I think, in scope and approach.
Also, I think you have so many interdependent pieces. You
have air traffic control systems, particularly the shift from
terrestrial-based air traffic control management to satellite-
based air traffic control management with NextGen. There are
significant issues with the interference and cyber hacking,
potentially, of signals and satellites that create the position
awareness for those aircrafts and for controllers to be able to
control those aircraft.
In my previous life I was an air traffic controller in the
Air Force, and I will tell you being able to have positive
control in everything in your airspace is of paramount
importance, for obvious reasons. So, for those reasons I do
believe that there is greater complexity because there are more
interoperating systems, and there is a much broader landscape
to cover, geographically speaking.
Mr. Larsen. Does the FCC's decision on 5G, where the
aviation sector expressed concerns about the size of the buffer
between mid-band wasn't wide enough to protect aviation, do you
see that as an additional vulnerability, or is that a separate
issue for the aviation sector?
Mr. Stephens. I see that as an additional vulnerability.
Anything that potentially impacts the safe navigation in our
airspace, whether it is from 5G, or whether it is interference
with global positioning satellites, or any other type of
malicious intrusion or unintentional intrusion becomes a huge
issue. It is a force multiplier.
And our colleagues from the maritime space and the surface
transportation, they are all dealing with the same things.
However, it is a little bit different when you are cruising at
500 miles per hour and 40,000 feet. You don't have that much
room for error. And that isn't being said to minimize the
situation with any of the other represented sectors. However,
the consequences of error in aviation, potentially, are
significantly greater. So, anything that impedes the safe flow
in that airspace is a huge issue that we all have to make sure
that we are coordinating on.
Mr. Larsen. Yes, thank you. I want to shift to Ms. Samford,
please, if you could prepare, just to ask you about the
Incident Command System for Industrial Control Systems, and the
model for the National Incident Management System. You
discussed applying that in private-sector response, mainly.
But is that system adaptable to all industries? Is it a
template you can just pick up and put down? Or do you
anticipate, within the transportation sector, it would have to
be modified industry by industry?
Ms. Samford. That is a wonderful question, and thank you
for it, Congressman Larsen.
Incident Command System is used globally. It was recently
endorsed by the United Nations, so it is really a model. It is
a framework that sits on top of existing plans. So, it is
really industry or sector agnostic.
Mr. Larsen. Yes, OK. I am not sure the U.N. endorsement
would please some of the Members in the U.S. House, but that is
fine.
Back to Mr. Stephens briefly, then. I have got 30 seconds,
total. How can Congress incentivize the aviation sector to
address cybersecurity issues? Are there specific points that we
ought to do, other than what you have mentioned in your
testimony?
Mr. Stephens. I think there are some specific things,
Congressman. Very quickly, in the interest of time, I think
there needs to be more investment, first of all. If you look at
the TSA proposed guidance out there that requires all of these
different things, they are good things. They are headed,
notionally, in the right direction. But without investment,
without developing the capacity and capability and workforce,
they are just prescriptions that can't really be met.
When you see one airport, you have only seen one airport.
They are different in size and scope and resources. So, every
airport that is a commercial airport wouldn't be able to
achieve that. So, if I had to give you one thing, it would be
more focused investment, and talent development, as well as
resources to meet any prescriptions that are set down from
Congress or TSA.
Mr. Larsen. Thank you very much.
Ms. Norton. Next, I call on Mr. Webster for 5 minutes.
Mr. Webster. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Dr. Kessler, my first question is to you. You mentioned the
unique--maybe the unique--problems with autonomous shipping.
You mentioned one example, and that was a lookout. Are there
other things that would be unique--and maybe bring on new
hazards and so forth, as far as cybersecurity--to the area of
autonomous shipping?
Mr. Kessler. There are some things with the autonomous
vessels, but that also actually impact the nonautonomous
vessels.
Autonomous vessels, of course, are going to be highly
reliant on position navigation and timing systems, which is to
say GPS. They are also highly reliant on situational awareness
systems, such as the automatic ID system that allows vessels
that are in proximity to identify themselves to other vessels
in terms, not just of location, but also, of course, heading,
rate of turn, destination, and speed, all that kind of stuff. I
mean much more than, for example, radar would give you. Those
systems are also highly unsecure.
Mr. Stephens referred to a little bit about the importance
that aviation has for GPS. Maritime also has the same reliance,
and that reliance, once we get into the near-coastal waters, is
particularly important. As an example, if I can somehow spoof
your GPS signal, and make you go off course by 100 meters or so
in the open ocean, well, that is not good, but it is not
terrible. If I cause you to go 100 meters off course in Kill
Van Kull, as you are going into the Port of New York and New
Jersey, that is a big problem, because I can now block the
entire port. So that is one of the issues that we have.
The situational awareness system that I mentioned, AIS,
also is not terribly secure, and can be easily spoofed. And we
have seen some--you know, the more egregious demonstrations of
that in the Black Sea during the NATO exercises last June.
But again, going back to the autonomous vessels, it is not
just the lookouts, it is also the entire--being able to control
the vessel. And if I can get something to go off course,
obviously, that is, I think, a big potential problem with those
vessels.
Mr. Webster. Thank you very much.
Mr. Stephens, can you tell me, at Tampa International
Airport, I guess you had mentioned that there have been great
strides made, as far as cybersecurity. But on the other hand,
you picked up some strides on the other side, from attacks and
so forth. Can you elaborate on that any more?
Mr. Stephens. Congressman, yes. What I will tell you is
that most airports, particularly your large hub airports, which
are your 30 largest by traffic, passenger traffic airports, are
under attack constantly. We at Tampa International probably
defend about 3 million malicious cybersecurity attempts at our
network every year.
And while we, here at Tampa International, have done a
pretty good job by most standards, we have adopted the NIST
standard, and we also have adopted aspects of another standard
called COBIT. We still are looking at making sure--how can we
harden our network? How can we train our employees to recognize
these threats and attacks?
And the problem with cybersecurity defense: we have to be
right almost 100 percent of the time. The bad guys don't have
to be right all the time. They have to be able to get at us one
good time, and you can really disrupt some things.
So, in summary, it is just an enormous, enormous challenge
out there. The good thing is, though, that we don't do it
alone. Everything, from CISA to TSA to the FBI and all of our
partners, there is great information sharing and exchange, as
Mr. Farmer alluded to in the rail industry. And we do the same
thing in aviation by mandate.
So, we are not strangers to mandatory information sharing.
Again, as I stated before, it is the nature and the quality of
what we share that is really going to make the difference.
Mr. Webster. USF has--out of the university system, the
University of South Florida has been one of the designated
cybersecurity hotspots. Are they part of your team, too?
Mr. Stephens. That is a great question. We do a lot of work
with the cybersecurity groups around here, particularly coming
out of USF. They hold a fantastic conference. We send some of
our folks to that conference to participate. But again, I think
we can do even more, maybe getting them involved in more
tabletop exercises, and things of that nature. But we do
participate with those local groups such as USF.
Mr. Webster. Thank you very much. I yield back.
Ms. Norton. I now recognize Mr. Carson for 5 minutes.
Mr. Carson. Thank you, Madam Chair. I really appreciate it.
As a former law enforcement officer who worked at our
Indiana Intelligence Fusion Center, I am always concerned about
making sure that information sharing is strong, and I know how
critical it is for Federal officers to share timely and
detailed information with local and State partners.
Tell us, what is working well? What needs to be improved?
And what do you recommend to improve the flow of information to
strengthen cybersecurity for transportation, and even
infrastructure?
Mr. Kessler. Well, if I can say a few words about
maritime--and I will keep this short--there is a very strong
reporting requirement, at least within U.S. waters, and
possibly even with all U.S.-flagged vessels, the few that we
have, that they report on any safety issue to the U.S. Coast
Guard.
We are only now really beginning to view cybersecurity as a
safety issue. And so, while the mechanism in place--at least,
again, in maritime and U.S. waters--to provide information to
the Coast Guard, we need to have some better reporting
structure and requirements for those cybersecurity issues to
get reported up. There is a lot of work being done that all of
the ports in the United States need to have a facility security
plan, and now they have to have a cybersecurity amendment to
that plan. So, the process is moving, albeit a little bit
slowly.
Mr. Belcher. I would say, from the transit perspective,
there is a lot of communication that comes from the major
transit associations, particularly APTA. They have a number of
committees that communicate with their members, both large and
small, a lot of standard development.
AASHTO also has a committee that works largely with the
smaller and rural transit associations. So, there is a lot of
communication in that regard.
And then TSA works closely with those associations.
And I think what you are starting to see is greater
engagement by this administration in cybersecurity. And as a
result, you are starting to see greater and greater engagement
by the administration, both--obviously, from DHS, but now even
at the Department of Transportation level with the industry.
And that is something that is new.
Mr. Carson. Thank you----
Mr. Farmer. Tom Farmer, if I could, sir.
Mr. Carson. Oh.
Mr. Farmer. On the point of information sharing, what is
working well among sectors in transportation is cross-sector
sharing through the different information sharing and analysis
centers for aviation, oil and natural gas, for public
transportation, the railway network that we manage. And that
has been very helpful in organizations understanding what
others are seeing in transportation, from a cybersecurity
perspective, and that gives insight.
If you are considering attackers, they likely haven't gone
after one transportation entity. They are likely going among
several to try to find opportunities. And so that sharing of
indicators of cybersecurity concern can be very valuable for
our awareness.
I think, importantly for the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency, it is those sorts of signals
that can help them determine whether what is happening is
indicative of a pattern, of trends of a potential developing
threat that merits attention. So that [inaudible] is working
very well.
And there is a group that the TSA Administrator has
appointed called the Surface Transportation Security Advisory
Committee. It is a direction that Congress gave in the TSA
Modernization Act of 2018, and it comprises representatives of
each of the surface transportation modes: security support
experts, State and local government representatives. And that
committee earlier this year made 18 unanimous recommendations
to the TSA Administrator, all of which he has accepted. Four of
them focus on cybersecurity information sharing, with the aim
of building this early notification network of sharing among
sectors of what they are seeing, so that their colleagues can
understand what the potential threats are. Thank you.
Mr. Carson. Thank you. I yield back, Madam Chair.
Ms. Norton. The gentleman yields back. I call on Mr. Massie
for 5 minutes.
Mr. Massie. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I find this
hearing somewhat terrifying. It is based on the premise that
Federal involvement in ensuring cybersecurity in the private
sector is either necessary or sufficient. It is not either of
those things. And so, I am worried.
I mean, asking this committee to come up with standards for
platforms in cybersecurity is a little bit like asking my
cattle to write a term paper on one of Shakespeare's works. I
mean, we are just not qualified to do it, and I am going to
include myself in that. I have an undergraduate degree in
electrical engineering and computer science from MIT. All that
qualifies me to do is to know what I don't know. And I am
terrified at what we don't know.
If some legislation comes out of this--and maybe it is
already written, probably already written--if it is going to be
written, it is going to be written by the vendors, who
continuously fail to protect the assets of the Federal
Government and the private sector.
And so, with that, I want to ask Mr. Kessler, can you tell
us what a zero trust architecture solution is, and why that
might have advantages over some of the other architectures in
the context of cybersecurity?
Mr. Kessler. Well, actually, there were a number of things
that you said that--since your background--well, I didn't go to
MIT, but--matches mine.
So, the zero trust architecture, it is basically, in my
view, a relatively recent buzzword for trying to put together
the idea that I start out with not trusting any entity with
whom I communicate. And so, trust has to be designated. And it
is a way of controlling access, not only to the fact that you
and I can communicate, but, in fact, what we are going to
communicate about, what you have access to. And again, I don't
give you access to anything except that which I have
specifically given you access.
However, you mention a point that I would like to say a few
words about.
Mr. Massie. What--OK. If I have time at the end, I will
allow you to do that.
Mr. Kessler. OK, all right.
Mr. Massie. The zero trust architecture, is it possible to
build that on top of, say, a Microsoft operating system?
Mr. Kessler. I believe you can, at the application level. I
will keep it there. Yes, I believe you could.
Mr. Massie. OK. I believe you can't, because if you are
using the Microsoft operating system, you are getting updates
from a vendor that you implicitly have to trust, or else the
operating system does not work.
You are also getting an operating system that you can't
audit. No audit is possible. Microsoft would not give you that
level of access to know that--if you have a platform.
But I will allow you the application itself might be zero
trust, and I think that was your answer. You are, obviously,
more knowledgeable in this than me. I am just trying to point
out to everybody else that everything underneath of that
application cannot be trusted, because you can't audit it.
And so, I want to go on and just say, Mr. Belcher, you
talked about the vast unwashed, and you were shocked that a CEO
of a transit company didn't know how to secure a Zoom meeting.
Would you be willing to put $1 million in bond, and we hire a
hacker, and see if you can protect a Zoom meeting?
Mr. Belcher. No.
Mr. Massie. OK, I wouldn't, either, because, from a
directed, focused attack, it is really not even possible to
guarantee that.
Ms. Samford, you use the words ``consistency,''
``interoperability,'' ``uniform,'' and ``coordinated.'' Every
hacker is getting excited when they hear that. It is like every
castle has the same defense. And by the way, you have to trust
the vendor, so it is like every castle's guard at the gate
doesn't work for the people inside the castle, it works for
somebody else, and they all use the same secret knock. And so,
you could get in the door by trusting this vendor. And so, the
hackers love these words ``consistency,'' ``interoperability,''
``uniform,'' and ``coordinated.'' This is what allows them to
hack not just 1 person on any given day, but 10,000 companies
on any given day.
I am running out of time. I would suggest that, if Congress
has any role here in mandating anything, it would be to have
audits, and audits that are not written by the vendors, audits
that are third-party audits that test--penetration testing of
these systems. Otherwise, if you let vendors audit themselves,
it is not going to work.
And with that I will yield back, and if somebody gives me
more time I would love to go on.
[Laughter.]
Ms. Norton. The gentleman's time has expired. I now
recognize Mr. Payne for 5 minutes.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Mr. Belcher, under the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008,
Congress mandated that all Class I railroads and commuter and
intercity passenger rail providers install Positive Train
Control systems. Positive Train Control systems work to prevent
unsafe movements and accidents by using an information network
to regulate trains' positions. However, information networks
can be vulnerable to bad actors, and must have adequate
cybersecurity protections.
How should freight railroads and commuter and intercity
passenger rail providers best protect these critical systems,
and what consequences could result from a cyber incident of PTC
systems?
Mr. Belcher. Well, I think Mr. Farmer is probably better
qualified to respond to that question than I am----
Mr. Payne. OK.
Mr. Belcher [continuing]. Given his background.
Mr. Payne. All right. Mr. Farmer?
Mr. Farmer. Yes, sir, excellent question. Positive Train
Control is a safety overlay to our operations. And I think what
is significant here is, as opposed to many of the industrial
control systems that we have seen hacked, a lot of them are
older systems, not designed with cyber threats in mind. PTC has
been specifically designed with cyber threats in mind.
And in particular, through the Rail Information Security
Committee, which I referenced earlier in testimony, a concerted
effort was devoted to coordinating with the National
Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, to do the
sort of work that has been referenced a number of times in this
hearing, to look at how the system was designed, to take the
view of an adversary, to conduct penetration-type activity, to
determine where potential vulnerabilities might be, and enable,
as the development process proceeded, those matters to be
addressed with effective cybersecurity measures.
Built into PTC you have, in particular, network
segmentation, advanced encryption, short-term access
authorizations for moving trains, all of which are designed to
narrow the possibility that, one, a breach can happen; or
secondly, if it does, that it can spread beyond the limited
site in the network.
So that has been a concerted effort, and developed with
cyber threats in mind, with support of Government through the
National Laboratory, and through the proactive information-
sharing work we do with CISA and TSA. Thank you.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
And Mr. Farmer, good cyber hygiene is very important to
protect against potential consequences that you just
articulated. As chairman of the Railroads, Pipelines, and
Hazardous Materials Subcommittee, I have a responsibility to
ensure that freight railroads meet the evolving threat of
cyberattacks.
Your testimony makes it clear that AAR opposes TSA's
security directives. What assurances can you give this
committee that freight railroads have taken the steps necessary
to deal with a cyberattack targeting these critical systems?
Mr. Farmer. Well, the assurance is demonstrated in the
experience of what we do in the industry, experience that is
well-known to our partners in Government.
I mentioned earlier the committee that we have focused on
cybersecurity more than two decades in duration. That group
convenes twice monthly. It is an effective forum for sharing
information on cybersecurity concerns, and on effective
practices to mitigate risk.
The sorts of sound, fundamental measures that are taken
across our industry include training for users on networks,
drills of that training to make sure that the learning is
tested and evaluated, exercises conducted within the railroad,
conducted with TSA through its intermodal security training
exercise program, and a national-level industry exercise we
hold every year, where we take actual cyber incidents that have
happened in other industries, and posit what would we do in the
railroad industry if faced with similar situations.
And that gets into the key measure here, which is the well-
developed preparedness and incident response plans that
railroads maintain and constantly exercise, constantly refine,
based on the assessments we do, based on what we learn, in
particular from our interaction with Government on the nature
of the evolving threat. Thank you.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
And Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
Ms. Norton. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize Mr.
Perry for 5 minutes.
Mr. Perry. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Mr. Belcher, your testimony explains that even the
transition to electric buses brings with it a whole new level
of cyber exposure and other security risks not previously
anticipated. Given the majority's push to electrify everything
without regard to the consequences, this statement may fall on
deaf ears. But I think it is important to ensure everyone here
knows what you mean by that statement.
Can you tell us how much greater is the cyber exposure in
an electric bus fleet, relative to a diesel bus fleet?
Mr. Belcher. Well, it simply creates a new threat vector in
the sense that any time you add a new opportunity, a new
digital connection, you create a new opportunity for an
adversary to access your network.
Mr. Perry. So, are you talking about things like the
ability to degrade batteries remotely, cause fires, manually
take over controls of the vehicle, that kind of thing?
Mr. Belcher. Yes, you have created an opportunity to access
the network. But----
Mr. Perry. So----
Mr. Belcher. But you are talking about sophisticated
companies that are far more sophisticated, and that are
building in protections into their bus systems and into their
networks.
So, I think, while there are risks that come with that, new
risks that we never thought about, these are sophisticated
companies that are building in cybersecurity protections, as
they develop these new technologies.
Mr. Perry. But would you also say, then, I mean, based on
that, yes, they are building in protections, but haven't
computer companies and automation companies built in security
protocols all along, but yet they have still been breached over
and over and over again?
Mr. Belcher. One hundred percent. We would be far safer if
we were still running diesel buses that were not connected to
anything, and that had no digital connections to anything.
Mr. Perry. Right, OK. So, your testimony cites the 2020
Mineta Transportation Institute report on cybersecurity in the
transit sector extensively. This report presents some pretty
damning conclusions. As you noted, the 2020 MTI report
concludes that, for many transit agencies, internal resources
for cybersecurity are scarce. And you go on to cite reports
finding that 43 percent of the agencies do not believe they
have the resources necessary for cybersecurity preparedness.
To me, this raises a legitimate question about what exactly
the taxpayer is getting back for the tens of billions of
dollars per year that the FTA provides to transit agencies, and
the nearly $90 billion we have given them in the past 2 fiscal
years.
I mean, if transit agencies have failed to invest in
protecting their cybersecurity systems, and have failed to do
regular maintenance and upkeep, leaving more than $100 billion
in state-of-good-repair backlog, both allegedly due to lack of
resources, what in the hell are they spending their money on?
Mr. Belcher. You know, that is----
Mr. Perry. Yes, I guess that is probably not a fair
question. Let me ask you this----
Mr. Belcher. It really isn't a fair--yes, OK.
Mr. Perry. I think the answer to that question might be a
result of section 13(c) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act
providing for employee protective arrangements, or agreements
that effectively provide labor union leadership veto power over
any potential Federal grants to their employer, which gives
union leadership unparalleled negotiating leverage to force
transit agencies to cave in to their demands.
This requirement is largely, in my opinion, responsible for
the steep decline in transit worker productivity after it was
enacted in 1964, despite the fact that nearly every other
industry saw significant productivity increases.
It is also a significant contributing factor to the
sector's uniquely high labor cost, as a percentage of operating
cost, and massive, unfunded pension liabilities.
Given this background, would you agree that section 13(c)
needs to be either repealed or, at the very least,
significantly reformed so that transit operators are able to
invest necessary resources to protect from physical and cyber
threats?
Mr. Belcher. I have no opinion on that.
Mr. Perry. All right. How about the authors of the report
emphasize the FTA should require transit organizations adopt
and implement minimum cybersecurity standards prior to
receiving Federal funding, where do you stand on that?
Mr. Belcher. I agree.
Mr. Perry. There you go. Thank you, Madam Chair, I yield
the balance.
Ms. Norton. The gentleman yields. I now call on Mr.
Carbajal for 5 minutes.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Mr. Stephens, you highlight the importance of cybersecurity
information sharing and communication. You also highlight how
information sharing between the Government and the private
sector has not been as effective as it could be, because it is
voluntary.
What should be considered when thinking of legislation
regarding mandatory cybersecurity information sharing and
communication between the Government and the private sector?
Mr. Stephens. Thank you, Congressman, for that question.
One of the things--I would start from this perspective.
Before legislation is struck, I think there has to be robust
dialogue with the entities or the sectors that are going to be
regulated. Sometimes moving too quickly to get something out
significantly creates more obstacles, and more bureaucratic
redtape, and impairs the cybersecurity preparedness of certain
agencies, as many of us have spoken about.
To that end, though, a voluntary structure where there is
no enforcement is relatively meaningless. You have to have some
mechanism for enforcement. So, it is not a one-size-kind-of-
fits-all approach. It is a holistic approach that, I think, our
Federal Government has to take towards cybersecurity.
I will give you a primary example. Under FISMA, which--CISA
is responsible for reviewing all of the Federal agencies,
right? The vast majority of them have received D's. So the
question becomes, if we can't--under FISMA, which has been
struck some time ago--police the cyber hygiene of our own
Federal agencies, it is a very difficult hurdle to then create
mandates that are not attainable for other covered sectors. So,
involvement with those covered sectors and getting really solid
advice and perspective before those things come out is
important.
And I will finish with this. Again, going back to the TSA
proposal, for example, there was a 24-hour time reporting
requirement under that proposed guidance. Most entities who
have cyber incidents cannot begin to even do analysis on
anything with respect to a cyber incursion in order to be able
to meet that requirement, versus what is happening in the
Department of Defense under the National Defense Authorization
Act is a 72-hour requirement.
So, in short, I think that, while mandatory reporting
requirements are great, it is what do we report and how do we
report those things.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you very much.
Dr. Kessler, you are an educator on the topic of
cybersecurity at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, and I am
interested in your insight into the importance of cybersecurity
training programs to strengthen our defenses.
Your recent report, ``Raising the Colors,'' highlighted the
need for industry-recognized certification in both information
technology and operational technology fields, and the creation
of cybersecurity training programs by the Coast Guard and the
Department of Transportation.
With the support of the Department of Energy, the
Department of Homeland Security, as well as the State
Department and international organizations as vital to
cybersecurity improvements, could you discuss the need for
standardized training and certification in the Nation's cyber
defenses?
Mr. Kessler. Thank you very much for the question. I think
we need to have certain standardization, so that everybody is
at least getting the same baseline understanding and is on the
same page of what it is we are trying to protect. I think it is
incredibly important to recognize through this, and
particularly as you are all considering legislation.
I agree, again, with what Mr. Stephens just said about
working closely with stakeholders. The solution to cyber is not
solely a technology solution. I will pull out an old quote that
says anyone who thinks their technology can solve their
problems doesn't understand technology and doesn't understand
their problems.
If people are a big part of the problem, then people have
to be a big part of the solution, and technology can't save
them. Because people who don't know what they are doing can
always get around the technology. So that is why the training
is so incredibly important.
And there does need to be a certain global aspect to it,
since the ships are going everywhere, and coming from
everywhere, and can carry malicious software and viruses from
port to port.
And so, again, the training has to be on the technology
level, so that we have the appropriate number of technologists
in the field, as it has already been discussed, that we are way
short on the number of cybersecurity practitioners. But
essentially, today everybody has become a cybersecurity
practitioner, since we are all carrying around multiple devices
that we need to secure.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. I am out of time.
I yield back, Madam Chair.
Ms. Norton. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize Mr.
Davis for 5 minutes.
Mr. Rodney Davis. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to
all of the witnesses today. I would like to start my
questioning with Mr. Farmer.
Mr. Farmer, do your members usually subscribe to more of a
centralized cybersecurity operation at their specific
railroads, or is it more decentralized?
Mr. Farmer. What you have with railroads is, through the
headquarters elements you have cybersecurity expertise through
chief information security officers, specialists in
cybersecurity, well-trained personnel on the cybersecurity
staff who, notably, participate in a training program hosted by
Idaho National Laboratory, which looks at networks from a red-
team perspective, and allows them to conduct penetration
operations and learn what the adversary is looking to
accomplish.
So, in that sense, what you have is probably something akin
to my experience in the Air Force: centralized control, but
decentralized execution, in terms of allowing the experts to
apply their skills in ensuring network cybersecurity posture is
maintained.
Mr. Rodney Davis. So, the decentralized portion of your
response there is indicative of--do you believe it is easier
for a cybersecurity criminal to hack a more centralized system
that is just in one location, versus a system you just
described, that many of your members use?
Mr. Farmer. I think the key on what is easier for an
adversary to hack comes down to the network architecture, and
that is where the emphasis placed by railroads on ensuring
network segmentation and on strong controls for access, those
efforts, are vital. So, it is not so much whether it is a
single point versus multiple points, it is more along the lines
of how are you designing the network architecture, and putting
in your layered cyber defenses in a way that creates
opportunities to detect, disrupt, and prevent adversaries from
inflicting harm.
Mr. Rodney Davis. It just seems to me that it would be
easier for our adversaries to go after systems that are
uniquely intertwined at all levels, rather than decentralized,
which I seem to--I guess I am understanding your response to
say that you do have somewhat of a decentralized approach for
possible redundancy issues and security issues.
What would you recommend we do, when it comes to
transportation systems at the Federal level, when we certainly
rely upon much more of a top-down approach when it comes to
other systems in place?
What can we do to copy this more decentralized approach,
and thus make it more secure?
Mr. Farmer. Well, I think your point on redundancy is
exceptionally well taken. A lot of effort devoted in the
industry to establishing backups, backups for programs and
files, backups for operational control systems. And so, you
have multiple options, should one component be adversely
impacted, for the operation to continue.
I think what we have seen, particularly over the past
several months, in terms of cyber intrusions, as you see in the
CISA advisories on these events, this reference to highly
sophisticated threat actors employing very well-developed
tactics that reflect a great deal of understanding of networks,
and I think there are two challenges that come into play there.
One is, in many cases, these are referred to as ``supply
chain vulnerabilities,'' where the adversary has determined,
has identified the vulnerability present in a particular
software application, and done the necessary surveillance of a
network to exploit it. And CISA frequently recommends that
railroads, other critical infrastructure organizations engage
with their suppliers, and we do that in the industry through a
dedicated group with our key suppliers.
But there is a key element, in terms of what Congress can
do, I think, that merits attention, and that is one of the CISA
recommendations is you should be getting from your supplier is
a software bill of materials. And essentially, that is the
delineation of all the software elements in the vehicle,
equipment, device that you have procured, so that you, as the
end user, know what software is included, and what versions are
present. So, when these issues come up with these supply chain
vulnerabilities and you need to know quickly, am I affected,
the software bill of materials gives you the means to do that
sort of reference.
And the second question that comes up is, are we doing
enough, in terms of deterrence? We have talked a great deal in
this hearing about network defense, and that is vital. But the
concern that we have in the private sector is, in contrast to
mitigating terrorism risk, which entailed a great deal of
effort internationally in intelligence and military operations,
the adversary's boldness, particularly of these past several
months, with these highly sophisticated attacks, indicates they
are not getting a deterrent message. And that is part of an
effective strategy. Thank you.
Mr. Rodney Davis. OK, I thank you. I would like to yield my
remaining time to Mr. Burchett.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Chairlady, and I yield the time
that Representative Davis gave me to Thomas ``The Hitman''
Massie.
Mr. Massie. If there is any time remaining, I would like to
allow Mr. Kessler----
Ms. Norton. There really isn't.
[Laughter.]
Ms. Norton. You will have to wait for someone else to
yield, because all of that time has now expired.
Mr. Massie. Yes, Madam Chairwoman.
Ms. Norton. And I am forced to----
Mr. Burchett. I am sorry, Chairlady, for that disruption. I
have not had my Mountain Dew this morning. I apologize.
[Laughter.]
Ms. Norton. All right. I now recognize Mr. Stanton for 5
minutes.
Mr. Stanton. Madam Chair, thank you so much for recognizing
me. I want to thank Chairman DeFazio for holding this important
hearing, I want to thank each of the witnesses here today for
providing important testimony on this critically important
issue that is growing in concern.
Cyberattacks against our water systems have become more
frequent, sophisticated, and dangerous. Back in February a
hacker gained access to the Oldsmar water treatment facility in
Florida. Their goal was to increase the level of sodium
hydroxide, otherwise known as lye, in the drinking water. While
Oldsmar was lucky that the facility's operator was at his
computer, and watching the hacker's attempts in realtime, the
results, if they had been successful, could have been seriously
harmful to residents and businesses who rely on that water for
drinking water.
Approximately 90 percent of our country's public water
supplies, and 80 percent of the wastewater utilities are small,
and serve fewer than 10,000 people. The hack at Oldsmar
demonstrates the vulnerability of small systems, and the
challenges they face in preparing for and responding to these
threats, compared to larger water systems. These systems have
smaller budgets, limited resources, sometimes only a small
number of employees to handle a significant amount of work. A
cyberattack is just one more challenge they confront, so they
must be strategic in how they approach this constantly evolving
threat.
Mr. Sullivan, you mentioned in your testimony that Boston
Water and Sewer Commission, where you are the chief engineer,
you suffered from a ransomware attack last year. What do you
believe are the lessons learned from that attack, and one that
I described in Oldsmar, for other water and wastewater
utilities, particularly small, rural, and Tribal systems, where
they might not have as much access to staff with cyber
expertise or financial resources?
Mr. Sullivan. Well, thank you, Congressman. We have been
working many years to build up our cyber preparedness, along
with most of your large water systems and wastewater systems.
The problem we had was this, it was the human element. One
of our staffers allowed an email, a phishing email, and he
opened it up, and he did not report that there was nothing
there when he opened it up. What happened there is some malware
got into our system [inaudible] and it sat, and--it sat for
over a month, because we were able to trace it back later. The
human element here is our biggest weakness. And we know that.
We have got all kinds of systems. Our firewalls are secure. We
are stopping things every day. We are getting attacked every
day.
The cybersecurity awareness, a culture of awareness in
every system, is the most important thing we need to do. And
that is, we need to get to training. Many of these small
systems are recognizing, they are struggling with making sure
we get pure water out there, we are struggling with the new
regulations of contaminants. The wastewater group, same thing.
We struggle with producing the product that we are required to
do, and many of the small ones may have IT systems that they
don't even know how they run. They hired someone, they came in,
a miracle occurred, all of a sudden you could operate from
home, and life was good.
They don't have the awareness, and that is what we are
trying to do through the ISAC, is continually remind people,
``Pay attention, read these''--we work with CISA, et cetera--
``Read all these reports, make sure you are doing this.'' But
they don't have the resources to hire people to check
everything else, and that is one of the major hurdles we have--
--
Mr. Stanton. Yes.
Mr. Sullivan [continuing]. Because we do have 50,000 water
systems and 16,000 wastewater systems.
Mr. Stanton. You mentioned ISAC, the Water Information
Sharing and Analysis Center, which was established, of course,
10 years ago to provide water utilities with critical
information on threats, both physical and cyber-related, along
with best practices for preventing and responding to those
attacks.
I mentioned earlier Tribal communities, and challenges that
the water systems in Tribal communities face. I want you to
address that. What specific outreach or work has ISAC done with
our Tribal communities? And if not, do you have plans to reach
out to our Tribal communities to make it a part of its work?
Mr. Sullivan. The ISAC is a subscription service. We have
over 400 members that cover much of the Nation. But we also
have the States. The States are part of the ISAC. They get all
our information, so that the States, through their resources,
can reach out to smaller systems, the Tribals, et cetera.
We are asking for additional resources to have the
subscriptions for everyone, every water and wastewater systems
paid for so, that we can reach everyone, and give them the help
they need to--we want to be able to take these threats, and
boil them down to what it means for each size system, so that
they can look at them, and they don't have to read these----
Mr. Stanton. All right.
Mr. Sullivan [continuing]. Lengthy documents.
Mr. Stanton. I am out of time, but my polite request is
that maybe ISAC will reach out to those Tribal communities and
the water systems there. It is so critically important that we
provide clean water to our Tribal members, and often they don't
have the same resources as others, but they have the same needs
for their community. So, my request is that ISAC see what they
can do to better reach out to our Tribal communities in
Arizona, and around the country.
Thank you, I yield back.
Ms. Norton. I now recognize Mr. Babin for 5 minutes.
Dr. Babin. Thank you, Madam Chair. I am so glad we are
having this hearing today for this committee to weigh in on the
issue of cybersecurity in the transportation and critical
infrastructure space. It is a great responsibility, and one
that we should all take very seriously.
It is also very timely. Just yesterday the Director of CISA
told the House Homeland Security Committee that ``ransomware
has become a scourge in nearly every facet of our lives, and it
is a prime example of the vulnerabilities that are emerging, as
our digital and our physical infrastructure increasingly
converge.'' She went on to say that, ``The American way of life
faces serious risks.'' She is right.
Internet attacks are a full-fledged standard feature of our
modern life. Hardly even a day passes anymore without a media
story coming out about a cyber threat or an attack. These
threats are disruptive, they are costly, potentially life-
threatening. All of us saw what happened with the Colonial
Pipeline breach last May, and how that attack led to gas
shortages and interrupted supply chains.
There is certainly a legitimate and appropriate role for
the Federal Government to play in protecting the American
people in our companies and businesses against theft,
espionage, and cyberattacks. No question. This is a fight for
our national security. However, cyber intrusions are very hard
to track. We have got to be extraordinarily careful, as
lawmakers, that we don't meddle in something that we don't
properly understand, and unintentionally cause bloated
regulation, or stifle innovation with overly burdensome
requirements that don't truly secure our infrastructure.
Any policy we push forward has got to be aggressive, but
consistent with our Nation's founding principles, meaning that
we provide for the common defense, while at the same time
protecting civil liberties and the free economic economy. A
former Director of National Intelligence, and my former Texas
colleague and friend, John Ratcliffe, said that we need to
attribute these attacks, and either to overtly or covertly
retaliate against those responsible, creating deterrence for
the future.
I could not agree more. There has to be a downside for
these enemies. And inflicting appropriate pain for their
attacks is not only justified, but I think absolutely
necessary. And if our long-term strategy to cyber criminals is
to just pay the ransom and hope for the best with cyber
insurance, we will certainly lose to our foes in this new
battlefront.
So, my question to all of you--and I will open this up to
anyone who would like to answer this--what are commonsense
steps that we, as lawmakers, can take to help the private
sector better protect themselves, and better report cyber
threats to the proper Government entities without infringing on
people's civil liberties or the free market?
I would open that up, please.
Mr. Belcher. Well, I will jump in. I think one of the key
things that organizations can and should do to protect against
ransomware is to make sure that they keep adequate logs, data
logs. And that is one of the things you see, particularly with
small, smaller, or less sophisticated organizations. And if you
are keeping adequate data logs, you can go back and recreate
everything that happened prior to the hack. And that way you
can avoid having to pay a ransom. And that is the best way that
you can manage against ransom attacks.
And so anything that Congress can do to encourage that--I
am not saying that you mandate data logs. It is good hygiene,
it is something that trade associations should be encouraging,
and should be providing guidance on, and it is something that
we should all be pushing for, because it is the best thing that
you can do to mitigate against ransomware, because it is
happening every day.
Dr. Babin. Thank you. Anyone else?
Ms. Samford. Yes, sir, thank you. And I think that it is an
excellent question. Thank you, Congressman Babin.
I always tell owners and operators there are a few top
things that they can do. Number one is to have a complete asset
inventory. You can't protect what you don't know about.
The second is to understand if you have direct exposure to
the internet. I think that Congress would be very frightened if
they were to examine the number of critical infrastructures
that have industrial control systems that remain directly
connected to the internet. That is an immediate and direct
source.
If I were Congress, if I were in that position, I would
direct all designated critical infrastructures within the
United States to ensure that they do not have any devices
directly connected. That would immediately eliminate tons of
exposure and risk.
And lastly, I would like to redirect and go back to the
point on ICS4ICS in that every single local fire department,
every emergency services, even our military, it is the way that
we mobilize to respond to events.
Out of all of the nationally declared disaster types, cyber
is the only one that is not mandated currently to follow
Incident Command System. I can tell you that being prepared and
being able to mobilize the private sector, which is where 85
percent of your response resources will come from in the event
of a nationwide attack, you will want a system like ICS to
integrate. By no means does having a common framework for a
response increase our risk or our threat. Those threats and
risk are already there. All it does is give us an advantage
over the enemy in effectively bouncing back from those attacks.
Dr. Babin. Thank you very much, and my time is out, and so
I will yield back.
Mr. Stanton [presiding]. Thank you so much. The next
Congressmember will be Congressmember Carter.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My
district recently suffered through one of the most intense
hurricanes to ever make landfall in the United States. Hearing
about the dangers threatening our systems through cyberattacks,
I can't help but be concerned about what would happen if bad
actors took advantage of a natural disaster to launch a
cyberattack.
According to a recent article on the topic, natural
disasters can set the stage for cyberattacks. Security experts
say that they are not aware of any major cyberattacks against a
State or local government during a natural disaster, but that
is only a matter of time, if we are not careful to prepare for
these things. And if a hacker launched a disruption to coincide
with a natural disaster, that could greatly hamper first
responders, hospitals, utilities, Government agencies.
According to the National Association of State Chief
Information Officers, this is a real threat.
So, I ask this question of you, Mr. Sullivan. Municipal
water systems in many areas have to cope with threats of
physical damage from natural disasters. I shudder to think what
would happen if a cyberattack occurred in the near proximity to
a natural disaster. Can you share your thoughts with me on
that, and do you think that any local systems should train and
practice for responding to a dual-threat scenario like this?
Mr. Sullivan. Certainly. First, the ISAC was formed because
of the events of 9/11. And for the first 10 years, we spent all
of our time talking about physical threats and natural hazards,
and how to make sure you can get your systems up and running.
And cyber wasn't really in the forefront at that time, because
there were no major threats for us on cyber.
So we have been training people on natural hazards all
along, how to do it, how to get yourself back up and running.
We all have emergency response plans. The AWIA that Congress
passed a couple of years ago required all systems serving 3,300
and more services to look at our natural hazards plan and our
cybersecurity plans. And we have to self-certify that we looked
at them and we have an emergency response plan.
So, I would say that most of your systems are definitely
capable of getting up and running. Now, they can't run with the
cyber. A lot of times communications are down, et cetera. They
will place people at the plants, and they can manually run
them. Most of our plants, although they are highly
technologically run, can be run manually. We are able to run
them that way. So, we are----
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Let me ask you, what do you think
Congress could do to make these types of trainings possible and
accessible to local governments?
Mr. Sullivan. Well, there is a lot of training going on.
EPA just ran some yesterday with CISA. We are working--American
Water Works Association has put out much training. And all your
water and wastewater national organizations have the training
available.
The problem is a lot of the smaller systems don't know
about it. We haven't been able to reach them to come in and get
the training, and that is where the ISAC is trying to expand
its reach, so that we can give them informed messages, informed
information of training for them, their size, and how they can
get available. So----
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. And maybe this is something that,
through this committee, Mr. Chair, we could utilize our
resources to enhance the availability or knowledge to local
governments of this resource. Obviously, it is a threat that
could be devastating. And having the preparation and training
could really go a very long way.
Do any of the other panelists have any thoughts on how
Congress could better help industries protect against
cyberattacks occurring around or during or after natural
disasters?
Mr. Farmer. Representative Carter, if I could, please?
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Yes, please.
Mr. Farmer. Thank you. One of the important areas to
emphasize, in terms of the emergency preparedness, is the level
of deployment of resources in advance of the storm, so that the
response and recovery effort happens immediately, as soon as
safe conditions allow.
I think a good point was made earlier about the ability to
maintain the capability to conduct manual operations. That is
part of how we operate in the railroad industry. In the event
there is an electrically or cyber debilitating environment,
trains can continue to move under manual procedures. We can
also relocate dispatch centers from impacted areas to others.
And as I mentioned earlier, a key facet of our cyber defense
and depth is having backup capabilities and backup files.
I think the point that you are getting to, though, gets to
a broader question of how does private sector across sectors
cooperate with Government, and what can we be focusing
attention on? I think there are two elements there.
One is, what are the sorts of cyberattacks that would be
most impactful, whether they are actually happening now or not,
looking forward to that potential. What we deal with now are
people looking to exploit the fact that there is a response
going on, and that there is going to be businesses trying to
come into an area, and you have a lot of fraud attempts. But
what could be done, positing a potential scenario?
And then, secondly, then working through the Critical
Infrastructure Cross-Sector Council, through CISA, through FEMA
in developing a collective approach to try to address that
problem.
I think the last aspect gets to a point that was raised in
an earlier question. And that is, there has to be some
deterrent aspect to our cybersecurity strategy. Adversaries
need to understand there are limits.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. I think I am out of time. I yield
back. Thank you.
Mr. Stanton. All right. Thank you very much, Representative
Carter. Next up will be Congressmember Weber.
[Pause.]
Mr. Stanton. Congressman Weber, are you there?
If not, we will move to Congressman LaMalfa.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate the
opportunity here today, and for witnesses that have gathered
online for our information here.
So, when we look at the--yes, I know, a lot has been
covered so far in the hearing today. But with the issue of
cybersecurity and, I guess, my more acute interest in how that
would be on small water systems and rural water systems. And
you know, in California, we do have several water districts
that distribute water to agriculture, but also they do have
hydroelectric power as part of their system, as well.
So, the smaller districts have a bigger struggle probably
coming up with the resources to compete, and have the best
cybersecurity capabilities that might come against them from
China or other terrorism activities.
Let me pose to Mr. Sullivan.
The Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center serves
districts of all types, all sizes. You had noted some that were
quite small, with 2,000 residents, or we can shift to
agriculture that aren't necessarily residents, but also indeed
very important in water delivery for what they do.
Could you touch on--if you have already, my apologies, but
what are some of the simplest, fastest, lowest cost protections
we could be emphasizing and starting with to help secure those
districts, especially in a time we have so much unrest and
potential for mayhem like that, and in an already stressed
economy and stretched water situation like we see in
California?
What are some of the things that they could be doing very
cost effectively, and quickly, and efficiently to tighten up
their cybersecurity?
Mr. Sullivan. Well, right off the bat, EPA has a great site
that will list all the things they need to do.
But what is really important is make sure they don't have
their operational technology, their SCADA control systems tied
into their information systems. It is so easy to get into an
information system, either through the human nature, or they
can just hack into it through an email, et cetera. But if you
can separate those two right off the bat, you----
Mr. LaMalfa. Separation, sir, a better separation, not
having--we heard stories about having the same access codes and
everything for the--so you want to have just a greater
separation between the two?
Mr. Sullivan. Yes, I want to separate all the pumps and
everything else that are run by technology, separate them from
your information systems, where--your email, your--all your
other systems. That is a very basic tenet. And if you can do
that, you really secure the ability for someone to control your
pumping stations, shutting yourself down, overloading your
stations, adding chemical where it shouldn't be added. That is
critically important, because many of the small systems have
embraced technology so that they can go home at night, and
these systems self-operate. And it is so important that they
separate those.
But the data available, it is out there. EPA has done an
incredible job. We work with the Water Sector Coordinating
Council, DHS, EPA, our sector leader. All this information is
out there. They just don't know where to go to get to it. And
that is the key that we need to get more of.
The rural water has riders, they go out and they educate
everyone, but keeping updated is important. If everyone thinks
that 5 years ago they took a review of their systems and life
was good, and they haven't looked at it again, they have got to
look at it again. It is ever changing. This whole security
issue is ever changing.
Mr. LaMalfa. Five years is a very long time, yes, yes.
Mr. Sullivan. An extremely long time. And we did that, we
had a big emphasis, we pushed it, and everyone thought they
were all taken care of. And now we have these additional
threats daily.
Mr. LaMalfa. So, when we are talking small districts with,
you know, not huge budgets with--if it is rural delivery or
agricultural delivery, do you see that it is going to be
affordable? Is it going to require a lot of staff, or a lot of
upgrades and technology and equipment? Or is it something that
can be piggybacked onto existing systems, if they are halfway
modern?
Mr. Sullivan. I think it could be piggybacked. It is $100
to join the WaterISAC if you are a system below 3,300, $100 a
year. There are 40,000 of them, though, and that is one of the
problems. They just don't have that $100, or they don't know
that they need this----
Mr. LaMalfa. Do you have confidence, sir, that the larger
entities like--well, the State of California, for example,
right in my backyard is the Orville Dam and the spillway that
broke apart, you remember that story from a few years ago. Do
you think the large ones, like States, are doing what they need
to do on 1960s technology to upgrade those, so that they can
keep control of their spillway gates and other aspects of their
water control systems?
Mr. Sullivan. I think the larger systems are in very good
shape. They are quite aware, because of the association of the
CIOs talking to each other. So, I think there has been a lot of
that going on.
What happens is the medium and small, and they have so many
other things tearing apart. Most of your water and sewer
operators in the country aren't computer literate. They hire
people to come in and set up the systems for them. So, they are
not quite aware of what we are all talking about all the time.
The big ones are. We have whole departments dedicated to that.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you. Thank you, I appreciate it. I yield
back.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much. Next up will be
Congressmember Lynch.
[Pause.]
Mr. Stanton. Congressman Lynch, are you on?
If not, next will be Congressmember Malinowski.
[Pause.]
Mr. Stanton. Congressman Malinowski?
How about Congressmember Kahele?
[Pause.]
Mr. Stanton. Congressmember Williams?
Ms. Williams of Georgia. I am here.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you so much. It is your turn.
Ms. Williams of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The topic
of today's hearing is one that is personal to me and my
constituents.
I know how critical it is to invest in cybersecurity,
because my district learned the hard way just 3 years ago. In
2018, a vicious cyber ransom attack devastated the city of
Atlanta. Residents of the Fifth Congressional District couldn't
pay their water bills, police departments lost investigation
files, the courts lost legal documents, and it took millions
for the city to recover. Our Atlanta airport is owned by the
city of Atlanta, and luckily we only had to shut down our Wi-Fi
for the duration.
What happened in Atlanta is a lesson to be learned from. We
need to ensure that we are prepared for any future
cyberattacks. And as a Member of Congress, I am dedicated to
ensuring what happened to Atlanta won't happen again.
Ms. Samford, what are the contemporary challenges that
State and local governments face today in confronting
cybersecurity challenges?
And what more can Congress do to assist them, and ensure
information sharing between the private sector and Government,
so we can prepare for and mitigate cyber threats?
Ms. Samford. Great. Thank you, Congresswoman Williams, and
that is an excellent question.
I think the main thing, honing in on the private sector, I
think, coordination and response aspect, is that specifically
what you would like me to touch on, is that private-sector
interaction?
Ms. Williams of Georgia. Yes.
Ms. Samford. Thank you. In particular, for the private
sector, there is no real way for the private sector currently
to hook into existing emergency management practices. So, I am
sure that you are very familiar with Atlanta. You probably have
an Atlanta emergency operations center. And your emergency
responders come in there, the different groups from the city of
Atlanta, water, wastewater, your energy companies, your
electric utilities, they all come in there, and support through
what are called emergency support functions, ESFs. This is part
of the Incident Command System structure that I was speaking of
earlier.
There needs to be a better mechanism for the private sector
to be trained on what Incident Command System is, what their
role would be in a disaster, in terms of integrating with the
Government, and then they can actually have representatives
that are sitting there in that EOC, ready to integrate into
your response efforts and reporting up through your incident
commanders through the city of Atlanta.
So that would be one recommendation: training of the
private sector, right? We can start on a voluntary basis and
see where that gets us. And secondly, have them take their
existing response plans--no one is telling them to get rid of
what they have. We don't want them to do that. We just want
them to learn the overarching Government framework that every
other first responder is using, so that cyber can stop treating
itself as something special and get with the program with the
rest of the way that the emergency response communities behave.
And that way we can begin to form coordinated responses
together.
Ms. Williams of Georgia. Thank you, Ms. Samford.
And Mr. Belcher, in your testimony you highlighted that
only 60 percent of transportation agencies have a cybersecurity
preparedness program in place. What are the most critical
additional resources that Congress can provide to ensure that
all transportation agencies are in a strong position to protect
themselves from cyberattacks?
From agencies that have programs currently in place, what
are some of the best practices that agencies should be sure to
adopt?
Mr. Belcher. So, I think the first thing that agencies need
to do is that they need to do an assessment of their cyber
maturity. Every agency has some level of cybersecurity
protection, whether they know it or not. Cybersecurity
protection comes with your Microsoft 360 system. You have got
some level of cybersecurity protection. And then many of your
more sophisticated systems also have protections in them.
But many of the operators really don't understand what they
have. So, you have to understand what you have to understand
what you need.
So, the first thing you need to do is to do an assessment,
and then you need--as Ms. Samford was talking about, is to
understand--is to then--to bring that into an enterprise
system, and to treat cybersecurity as just another--it becomes
another risk. It is another--you know, and you need to manage
it as a risk, as one of the many risks that you manage, so that
it becomes a way of doing business, and it becomes part of the
culture of the business.
Most of the threats are coming--or most of the hacks are
coming not at the IT level, but they are coming through the
users, and through phishing, through--and like--and I think I
keep hearing that I am about to be----
Ms. Williams of Georgia. Yes, Mr. Belcher----
Mr. Belcher. Got you.
Ms. Williams of Georgia [continuing]. We are running out of
time.
Mr. Belcher. OK.
Ms. Williams of Georgia. And before I yield back, Mr.
Stephens, I would like to just get some better ideas on how we
can address the unique cybersecurity challenges of major
airports, with Atlanta being the busiest airport in the
country, soon to be in the Nation. We are coming back, you all.
But I would love to get some written comments on how we can
better prepare in Atlanta, as you discussed what was happening
down in Tampa.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much for----
Ms. Williams of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I
yield back.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you. We will ask for a written response
to that question.
Next up will be Congressmember Van Duyne.
Ms. Van Duyne. Yes. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I
would like to relinquish my time to Congressman Thomas Massie.
Mr. Massie. I thank the gentlelady from Texas.
Ms. Samford, I wanted to give you a chance to answer my
concerns about consistency, interoperability, uniformity, and
coordinated systems.
But before that I want to highlight something really
important you said to one of my other colleagues. You talked
about the microcontrollers and embedded processors that are
connected to the internet that a lot of users don't even know
present security vulnerabilities.
Just for my colleagues, this is like if you bought a
coffeemaker, or an icemaker, or a dishwasher, and it is
connected to the internet when you get it home for your
convenience. Those things can be security vulnerabilities. But
within a sewer system, for instance, or a pipeline, they might
have things connected to the internet for remote monitoring.
So, can you talk about that, Ms. Samford, about how you
advise your clients, and what to do with those things?
Ms. Samford. Sure, and thank you, Congressman Massie. It is
a really good question. And what we see a lot of--and I don't
know that it is specifically with the programmable logic
controllers that PLCs--in many cases, those lack the ability to
directly communicate out to the internet, but they certainly
could talk through something else. What we see a lot of are
what are called human-machine interfaces, HMIs. To your point
about someone remote accessing in, they would be remoting in to
that engineering workstation, or HMI, to see what is going on
on that plant floor.
In many cases, if you go to a website right now called
Shodan.io, you can see tens of thousands of HMIs directly
connected in the United States and the U.K. and Australia,
globally. They are everywhere. And this main point of exposure
is that right now I could go to the login screen of this HMI,
and, if I am successfully able to log in--say, if the user name
is ``admin'' and then the password is ``admin,'' or if I am
just using a password cracker, I can get into that system
within a matter of minutes or hours. And once I am there, I can
see other devices that are on that network, because it is the
HMI, and it tells me that. And I can move laterally to do
whatever I need to do.
So, I always tell people, please have an up-to-date asset
inventory, know what you have so that you can protect it. And
secondly, make sure that nothing is talking out directly to the
internet.
Mr. Massie. Thank you very much. And did you--I didn't give
you a chance earlier to respond to my concerns about
consistency, interoperability, uniformity, and coordination. I
am worried that that--and sometimes that makes it easier for
the hackers to hack multiple systems at once.
Ms. Samford. I definitely understand and respect your
concerns. I think that it is a credit to you to understand the
nature of how hackers can work.
Sometimes--I can tell you that the system that I am talking
about, they have already gotten in, they have already performed
the attack. So, the response structure, the only thing it gives
us, is the ability to more effectively work with our local,
State, and Government officials. And I am not asking that this
be mandated at this point, but I am saying that it is really
good training. It is how every single fire department responds.
It is how, if someone was injured, the ambulance would show up.
It is using the same system.
So, I would liken it to--I wouldn't say that we would
suggest that having all firefighters trained in the country to
be able to work together and respond somehow contributes to
terrorist attacks. We don't see that correlation. So, we are
not seeing that data to suggest that risk at this time. But I
understand your point.
Mr. Massie. Yes, I was more concerned about, like, the
updates that happen, and such as that.
Mr. Kessler, you had a couple of things you wanted to talk
about, and we ran out of time. And also, if you could throw
into that group--you talked about the pros and cons of having a
human in the loop. It is not always a bad thing to have a human
in the loop, I would say. And could you talk about--I will give
you the remaining time.
Mr. Kessler. Well, I mean, humans are in the loop, one way
or another, either the human user with the hands at the
keyboard, or the designer of the system.
So, I wish more of my grad students had been like you,
Congressman Massie.
So, I used the ICS for decades. I was 25 years on the
ambulance in my hometown in Vermont, as a volunteer ambulance.
And so, cyber differs in this way. So, I need an organized
structure to do my defense. But, as an EMT, I would walk into
somebody's house, and I was always reminiscent of the saying
``No battle plan survives first contact with the enemy.'' I
know how I am going to respond.
The problem in cyber with having any static response, or
automated response to an attack is, if I can figure out what
your static response is going to be, I own you because I can
make you respond when I want you to respond, and I know how you
will respond, because too many of the cyber systems are not
built defensively to take into account that there is an
intelligent actor causing the problem.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you----
Mr. Kessler. Too many of our systems by engineers, of which
I am one, are designed to fail, thinking nature is our enemy.
And I understand [inaudible] what is going to happen, but I am
not building a system----
Mr. Stanton. All right----
Mr. Kessler [continuing]. [Inaudible] other people.
Mr. Massie. Thank you.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you.
Mr. Massie. I yield back.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you. Next up will be Congressmember
Johnson of Texas.
Ms. Johnson of Texas. Thank you very much. Let me express
my appreciation for this hearing, and the urgency of dealing
with the issue.
Five years ago, in my Dallas-based congressional district,
cyber hackers breached the Dallas Area Rapid Transit computer
system, targeting customer communication and business
processing tools. Just last year, hackers stole Trinity Metro's
data in Fort Worth, knocking out the Metro's phone lines and
entire booking system. And although not specific to the
transportation industry, electronic records were hacked at the
Dallas Independent School District in September, allowing the
hackers to gain access to the names, addresses, telephone
numbers, Social Security numbers, and medical information.
While just last month, the Dallas-based company of Neiman
Marcus notified 4.6 million customers that information
associated with their online accounts had been stolen.
Disheartening stories like this play out week after week in the
United States and across the globe.
So first I want to ask Mr. Belcher.
Mr. Belcher, much of the Nation's infrastructure is owned
and operated by the private sector. What controls and
procedures do you recommend synthesizing and strengthening
regarding cybersecurity in the private sector and the
Government partnership?
Mr. Belcher. Well, the good news is, many of the hacks that
you talked about in the public sector in the Dallas-Fort Worth
area have been moved to private-sector vendors.
Transit agencies now, for the most part, do not handle the
records of private riders, the financial records. Those are
typically handled by financial institutions now, because those
financial institutions are far better able and capable to
handle those records under a specific regime that has been
established, and they are able to protect those records far
better than public transit agencies are.
And really, at this point, only the largest public transit
agencies do it on their own, because of that. And so, I think
we have gotten a lot smarter. And I think, in the public
transit arena, public transit agencies are continuing to try to
push off as much as they can into the private sector, which
itself is becoming much more sophisticated than the public
agencies are.
Ms. Johnson of Texas. How do we transition to all-inclusive
security monitoring and tracking of information technology and
operational technology systems to protect against these
cyberattacks and breaches, and the alertness to enact immediate
incidence response?
Mr. Belcher. Well, you are never going to be able to track
everything, and that is the challenge. You have to try to stay
ahead, and you have to be able to be responsive. But you are
never going to be able to catch everything.
We now have systems that you can employ at the various
levels of your stack that can track what is going on, and that
can identify breaches. And every major system, whether it is an
OT, an operational technology system, or an IT system, an
information technology system, do have those systems in place.
And again, we pick up the vast majority of the hacks that
occur. It is the ones that slip through which are the ones that
we read about. So, we are getting better at discovering, and at
preventing them from occurring, and we have to continue to up
our game, and continue to get better.
I think what we are seeing, though, and I think what you
have highlighted, is that, especially in the public sector, we
are just not very sophisticated, and we are underresourced, and
we need all the help we can get. And so, we need to work with
Congress, with the Federal Government, and with the private
sector to elevate the game at all levels. Because if we don't
work together, we are going to continue to see the kinds of
breaches that you have talked about.
Ms. Johnson of Texas. You touched on my last question. What
amount of funding do you believe Congress should provide----
Mr. Stanton. Well, I think we are out of time,
Congressmember.
Ms. Johnson of Texas [continuing]. To assist individual
transit agencies like the Dallas Area Rapid Transit with
increasing their cybersecurity programs?
Mr. Stanton. Maybe we can get that answer in writing. We
are out of time, Congressmember Johnson.
Ms. Johnson of Texas. Thank you, I yield back.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you so much. Next up will be
Congressmember Balderson.
Mr. Balderson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for
being on today. My first question is directed to Mr. Farmer.
Mr. Farmer, you noted in your testimony that the rail
industry security plan does not just sit on a shelf,
occasionally taken down, and dusted off. Rather, it is a living
document elevated and enhanced continuously. It is great to
hear how importantly the rail industry takes cybersecurity.
It has also become obvious over the last several months
just how delicate our supply chain is. Mr. Farmer, can you
discuss the impact that a breach or a hack on just one Class I
railroad could have on our supply chain?
And then a followup to that would be what ripple effects
would we see if a Class I railroad had to shut down operations,
even if just for a few days?
Mr. Farmer. So, the question posits that the impact is one
for which the response capability would not be adequate to
sustain operations.
I think the key point to make there is the entire basis of
our cybersecurity program is to ensure the protection of the
operations from breaches, to contain any breaches that occur,
so that we are not facing a situation where the entire railroad
network has to be shut down.
And the key point here that came up in an exercise we held
at the Naval War College--the Naval War College invited
representatives of numerous critical infrastructure sectors to
an exercise in July 2016, and it focused on operating a
debilitated cyber environment. And we had participation by one
of our major freight railroads. And a key point made by its
chief information officer was, so long as I can communicate, I
can continue to move trains.
I think, for us, we have the ability to fall back onto
manual operations, if necessary, backup systems. So, the whole
thrust of what we are doing is to ensure we don't find
ourselves in a situation where that sort of shutdown happens,
by keeping in the layered defenses and the depth of operational
capabilities, even down to manual, and continuing to move
trains as safe conditions allow.
Mr. Balderson. Thank you. A followup to that, Mr. Farmer,
you recommended future cybersecurity legislation should direct
the CISA to establish consistent standards for software bills
of materials from vendors and suppliers. Can you expand on why
this is important in preventing cyberattacks?
Mr. Farmer. Yes, sir. So, a common theme, a recurring theme
in the high-profile attacks that have garnered such attention,
particularly in the first portion of this year, first several
months, was the supply chain vulnerability type attack. Again,
that is where an adversary has identified what is called a
zero-day vulnerability and exploits it.
And so, some of the major attacks that have been
perpetrated with alleged involvement by nation-state actors
have followed this model. SolarWinds is one example.
The software bill of materials gives the end user an
ability to understand fully what software applications and what
versions are on any of the vehicles, equipment, devices,
systems they employ. CISA strongly recommends that end users
have these bills of materials.
The challenge is there is no consistency in their being
provided. And when they are provided, there is no consistency
to ensure they are fully thorough and accurate. And there is an
opportunity here for CISA to define standards so that end users
can quickly act upon reported vulnerabilities, scan their
networks using these software bills of materials as a reference
point, and make any security patches to preclude the potential
for exploitation.
Mr. Balderson. Thank you very much. Great answer. My next
question is for Mr. Stephens.
Mr. Stephens, thank you for being here today. I understand
that Tampa International Airport is designated as a large hub.
But can you speak on the differences between the threats or
vulnerabilities faced at large hubs and the cybersecurity
issues facing small or medium hubs?
Mr. Stephens. Congressman, thank you for that question. The
threats are, at their very basic nature, the same. The impacts
are different. So, when you are talking about large hub
airports, particularly airports where there are a lot of
connections, we are more of an O&D, so, we don't do a lot of
connecting activity.
But the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, Los Angeles, all those
types of airports have a different threat profile, because
attacking them becomes a much more preferred target if you are
trying to create injury, if you are trying to create
disruption. Smaller airport systems here in Florida like, say,
Gainesville or some of the other smaller airport systems, the
primary driving factor or interest there would perhaps be data
or information from employees or other vendors.
So those are the major distinctions. It is the desirability
from a bad actor of the target, based on the scope and the size
and the damage that they want to do.
Mr. Balderson. All right. Thank you very much.
Mr. Chairman, I will yield back my remaining--well, I am
almost done. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you. Next up will be Congressmember
Johnson of Georgia.
[Pause.]
Mr. Stanton. Congressmember, I think you are muted right
now.
[Pause.]
Mr. Stanton. Congressmember Johnson of Georgia?
[No response.]
Mr. Stanton. Congressmember, I think you are muted right
now. Can you unmute?
[Pause.]
Mr. Stanton. All right. We will come back to you,
Congressmember Johnson. Next up will be Congressmember
Auchincloss.
[Pause.]
Mr. Stanton. Congressman Malinowski?
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I am ready to go.
It's Hank Johnson.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Congressman Johnson.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for
holding this hearing, and thank you to the witnesses for your
time and testimony.
The information age has radically changed our critical
infrastructure landscape. Earlier this year, cyberattacks on
SolarWinds and Colonial Pipeline demonstrated the emerging
threat of cyber warfare from state and nonstate actors.
However, the cybersecurity field is beset by a dire shortage of
specialists, especially among Americans of color and women.
We, as a Congress, must act now to provide young Americans
equitable access to cybersecurity training. The future of our
national security depends on it.
Mr. Belcher, this fall I introduced H.R. 5593, the
Cybersecurity Opportunity Act, with Senator Ossoff, a bill
which aims to create a pipeline of diverse cybersecurity
workers by investing in research and training at historically
Black colleges and universities and minority-serving
institutions.
You have served as the CEO of the Telecommunications
Industry Association, and president and the CEO of the
Intelligent Transportation Society of America. So, I assume you
have encountered issues regarding cybersecurity, workforce
shortages, and diversity.
A 2021 study estimates that the national cybersecurity
workforce is made up of 14 percent women, 9 percent Black
Americans, and 4 percent Latino Americans. Can you discuss the
importance of diversity goals, as they apply to cybersecurity-
related positions in transportation and other critical
infrastructure?
Mr. Belcher. Yes. I think it is a much bigger issue than
just cybersecurity. It is an issue that is playing out in all
of transportation and all of engineering.
Shawn Wilson, the secretary of transportation from
Louisiana, who is now the new AASHTO chair, has made that one
of his preeminent goals. He is also the incoming vice chair of
TRB. And so, there are leaders in the transportation community
who have made that a significant priority.
The interesting thing about--the only thing that I can add
is it has--finding women and people of color for technology
positions has been a significant issue in the industry for a
long time. It is becoming harder, but it is becoming even
harder because it is becoming difficult to find people, in
general, for these positions.
And so, what we are seeing now is--I am seeing my clients
contracting those positions out. Where they would normally have
hired in-house, they are now no longer able to find higher in-
house positions. So, transportation organizations now are going
to contractors and filling the positions with contractors. And
it becomes even harder, then, to fill those positions, to try
to fill them with STEM-type individuals. It has become even
more challenging, not less challenging.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you.
Mr. Belcher. So, I applaud you for your legislation.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Well, thank you, and we hope it
will make a difference.
Dr. Kessler, you have had extensive academic experience
teaching computer technology education at some of the top
engineering programs in America. Can you address how a more
diverse cybersecurity workforce would benefit your specific
infrastructure sector, and what steps you might advise private
industry in your sector to consider to improve diversity in
regard to cybersecurity positions?
Mr. Kessler. Well, I have a couple of comments. First of
all, I, too, applaud your legislation.
I would observe that one of the problems keeping an
appropriate number of all of our citizenry, but particular
people of color and women, is not at the college level. It is
at the K through 12 level. I believe that too many
individuals--and again, particularly women and particularly
people of color--are socialized out of STEM by sixth grade. So,
it is laudable, but late, in 12th grade to say, ``You should go
study STEM at college,'' because they haven't been prepared.
I have found that diversity of background gives me
diversity of thought, and that is what I need to build a cyber
defense. Because to build a cyber defense, I need to think like
my attacker. The same thought leadership, if you will, that got
me my problems are not going to get me my solutions, so I need
to have that diversity of thought.
So, is that addressing, I think, what you are asking?
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Yes, it does. And I thank you for
your comments.
Mr. Belcher, according to the 2020 MTI report presented in
your testimony, 81 percent of responding transit agencies felt
they were prepared to manage and defend themselves against
cybersecurity threats. However, only 60 percent had an actual
preparedness program, while 47 percent failed to audit their
cybersecurity program at least once a year. What requirements
should the Federal Government enforce, so that cybersecurity
safety is adhered to at these transit agencies?
Mr. Belcher. Well, if you look at the conclusions of the
study, I think that the conclusions kind of lay them out. I
think there are some basic requirements.
I think that agencies should be required to have a
cybersecurity response plan in place.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. I believe my time has
expired, and I yield back.
Mr. Stanton. Next up will be Congressmember Stauber.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Cyberattacks are a
serious and evolving risk that affect transportation and
infrastructure matters across this committee's jurisdiction.
The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's
jurisdiction includes 5 of the 16 sectors of cybersecurity
which include our transportation systems, Government
facilities, water and wastewater systems, dams, and emergency
services.
The Nation's critical infrastructure is comprised of both
public and private-sector assets. However, within this
committee's jurisdiction, cybersecurity requirements in the
private sector are mainly voluntary. Like other industries and
the Federal Government, the transportation sector is facing a
critical shortage of cybersecurity personnel, which has
impacted the ability to protect, detect, and respond to
cyberattacks effectively.
Simple steps regarding basic training, consistent
cybersecurity hygiene, and periodic exercises could go a long
way in protecting America's transportation infrastructure. As
the technology that enables America's infrastructure becomes
even more complex and increasingly integrated, cybersecurity
threats and vulnerabilities will continue to multiply.
My question is for Mr. Farmer.
Mr. Farmer, we have heard from several industries
expressing concern over potentially duplicative and conflicting
cyber reporting requirements to various Government agencies. Is
this a concern for railroads? And if so, what steps could
Congress consider to better harmonize such reporting across the
Government?
Mr. Farmer. So, that is an excellent question, and it gets
into two applications. One is what is being imposed by
requirements, and then what is being done under cooperative
efforts initiated by industries with partners in Government.
For requirements, a railroad with a cybersecurity incident
could find itself having to meet a TSA regulation from 2009
under the rail transportation security rule that requires
reporting of significant security concerns of requirements to
report to the Department of Transportation. If the transport
involves DoD supplies, requirements to report the DoD
components. And then, with the planned security directives, a
separate reporting requirement to the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency.
The concern there, obviously, is multiple reports on the
same matter going to different organizations, and the confusion
that can result.
Another key concern in this area, as has been noted
previously, is the short timeline envisioned by both of the
TSA--the current regulation and the pending security directive.
And that is a 24-hour period. And as has been detailed, it is
often very difficult in that short time window to complete the
analysis that helps an organization understand whether they are
dealing with a significant cybersecurity concern.
So we have--our view is this area can be readily addressed
through a collaborative process, based on what we have heard a
lot about today, in terms of the reporting that is already
taking place by our industry, in the water sector, the transit
sector, oil and natural gas sector, all of these industries
have created information-sharing analysis centers or, in our
case, the Railway Alert Network.
And the focus is on taking what we are experiencing, what
we are seeing, conducting analysis, and getting reports that--
again, using the standard that Jen Easterly has set, as
Director of cybersecurity at the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency, provides the Government with
signals, not noise, to aid their analytical efforts.
And I think, if there is an area where Congress' action is
vitally important, it comes down to two points.
One, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015
should be fully implemented, and it is not. That will create
the conditions--it specifically authorizes the kind of
information sharing we are talking about within sectors, across
industries, between industry and Government. It also provides
protections that remove impediments to timely flow of useful
information.
And the second element is we have got to close the gap on
analysis. A lot of reporting goes into Government, but it
doesn't often come back in terms of the sort of cybersecurity
information products transportation organizations need. It has
to be focused on transportation. What does this activity mean
to transportation organizations? What should they do about it,
in terms of some of the measures you laid out on cybersecurity
actions to narrow their risk profile?
Thank you.
Mr. Stauber. Well stated. That was a very defined answer.
And my time is running short here. Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you. Next up will be Congressmember
Malinowski.
Mr. Malinowski. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I wanted to address
some questions to Mr. Sullivan, and because I am, in
particular, very concerned about the water sector's
vulnerability to cyberattacks.
Most of us here are familiar with what happened in Oldsmar,
Florida. I think other Members raised that case, when an
intruder took control of an engineer's screen at a waterplant,
and dialed up the levels of sodium hydroxide. And thankfully,
it was noticed. The disaster was averted. But as former CISA
Director Chris Krebs has noted, after the attack, that the
vulnerabilities in the Oldsmar plant, as he said, are probably
more the rule than the exception.
There are a lot of things that need fixing here, and we
have heard about a number of them throughout the hearing today.
Municipalities need more funding, more in-house technical
expertise, better cyber hygiene practices, and more. And the
Federal Government can and should help with these things.
But it is also my view, at least, that the Federal
Government should also have a bit more visibility into these
breaches when they are discovered, that we shouldn't be
relying, as we do today, on voluntary reporting.
So, Mr. Sullivan, you noted in your testimony that your
organization, WaterISAC, created a step-by-step, 15-point
document to help water and wastewater utilities with
cybersecurity challenges. We took a look at that document, and
there is some very useful, actionable information in there. I
am grateful to the help you are providing to utilities.
But the language on reporting of incidents particularly
caught my eye. In the document you urge utilities and other
sector stakeholders to report incidents and suspicious activity
to your analysts at WaterISAC, and you further note that, as a
private nonprofit, WaterISAC is not subject to public records
law, further preserving the security of your report. Again,
sort of emphasizing the privacy of this information.
So, I wanted to ask your views. And I think the chairman of
the committee asked a number of others on the panel this
question before. What are your views on creating mandatory
reporting requirements for municipalities for certain types of
cyber incidents?
Mr. Sullivan. Well, mandatory can work. First of all, what
we have seen is that it was way too short a time. We struggled,
and we are pretty good at our IT. We struggled over the first
24 hours to find out what we were dealing with. So, if we do go
to mandatory, we have got to go 72 hours, and maybe not the
full report in 72, but reporting in 72 and then being able to
follow up a couple of weeks later, because it took us 3 weeks
to figure out exactly what happened.
Mr. Malinowski. Right.
Mr. Sullivan. As far as the mandatory, we then have to
explain to everyone what is an incident. And as I described
earlier, we have so many water systems that, although they have
cybersecurity protocols, et cetera, I am not sure everyone
understands an incident.
So, we have to be very careful. The water sector would
definitely work with Congress to help identify what triggers an
incident, or else every time something goes wrong, we are just
going to be flooding a market under the mandatory, because we
are so used to standards in the water and wastewater. You will
get a lot of information, much of which may be useless. So, we
need to be very careful what we call mandatory.
But that is the only way we are going to get it. WaterISAC
struggles to get people to report to us what is going on out
there, so that we can share that information and others can
learn from it. We constantly ask our members what went on, what
happened, so that we can take that information--take your name
out of it, and we will call it a utility in the Northeast, we
will call it a utility in America--and to share the information
so we can all learn. It is the only way we are going to figure
out what is happening in our sector.
Mr. Malinowski. That makes sense. And, I mean, it would--it
is fair to assume that there probably have been other Oldsmar-
like intrusions that we just don't know about, right, because
we don't have mandatory reporting.
Mr. Sullivan. I would say there definitely were other
problems that have occurred that weren't reported, because they
really didn't need to be, or they didn't realize they were a
cyber intrusion.
Mr. Malinowski. Got it, good. Thank you so, so much. I look
forward to working with you on this, and I yield back my time.
Mr. Auchincloss [presiding]. The gentleman yields. The
Chair recognizes the gentlelady from Puerto Rico, Miss
Gonzalez-Colon.
[Pause.]
Mr. Auchincloss. Miss Gonzalez-Colon?
[No response.]
Mr. Auchincloss. The Chair recognizes Mr. Burchett.
Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield time
sufficient to Thomas Massie.
Mr. Massie. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for
yielding me more than zero seconds this time.
Mr. Farmer, you spoke about something, a best practice,
what should be a best practice--but I think it is underutilized
and underappreciated--that you learned from consulting with the
Naval War College about operating in a degraded or debilitated
digital communications environment. It is my hope--and you
mentioned that you looked at how you could go to manual systems
in those times.
Also, I think a lot of people need to be doing that as a
best practice at waterplants, or pipelines, or sewer plants. I
think that is something that they should follow, and look to,
and even look at possible parallel analog systems. It is very
hard to hack an analog system, but everything has gone to
digital now.
And could you just tell us a little bit more about that
part of your process, or what you learned from the Naval War
College?
Mr. Farmer. The Naval War College exercise, sir, brought
together representatives of numerous critical infrastructure
sectors, including some represented in the work of the
committee in this hearing. It was an initiative where the
military wanted to do a focused exercise on a scenario
involving an activity by China that necessitated naval
deployment, and looking at, logistically, what would it take to
get all the resources to deploy a naval task force, and how
would that work in a debilitated cyber environment.
And a key question that came up over and over again is,
well, just how much operations could be retained if the
information technology systems were not as available as we are
used to them being prevalent. And for the rail industry, there
were repeated points made along the lines I referenced earlier.
Essentially, as long as communication could be made in some way
to get the train crews engaged, to get the trains organized,
typically for the military deployments is that priority, we
could continue to operate. It would not be as efficient as
normal, but we could continue to get trains to destination and,
with a priority to the military shipments, get the items from
forts to ports for deployment.
Beyond that exercise, we had a--during the 2017-2018
period, where we participated with Transportation Command and
Northern Command in a forts-to-ports analysis, where they were
looking at how the military deploys from its installations to
ports and coastal areas, and what are the logistics there. And
that work involved a great deal of sharing of information by
our industry on both our physical security, planning and
preparedness, and response measures, and on the cyber side, as
well, and so a very good partnership with military components,
in terms of ensuring we are able to support their operations in
situations where they need to get equipment and people--sorry,
mostly equipment--to ports for transport overseas.
Mr. Massie. Well, I surely hope that any legislation that
comes out of Congress doesn't force you into a system that
assumes that you will always be operating in a secure cyber
environment. And so, I am glad to hear that you have at least
tested what would happen in that instance, and you are going to
look like a prophet later, if they go back and look at this
hearing, if they have somehow forced you into a completely
digital solution that is not segmented. That was another thing
that you mentioned that I think is a really smart thing that
you--that one hack on your system wouldn't imply the whole
system was hacked. I think that is also a good best practice
that I hope will come out of this.
Part of the problem we have--and this is ironic--is our
Federal procurement standards sort of bake in vulnerabilities.
I don't know exactly what is available in the executive branch,
but in the legislative branch, if you wanted to buy a zero-
trust system that ran on Linux, you couldn't do it, because
there is interoperability requirements with the Microsoft
systems, which have--by the way, a lot of these commercially
available, widely deployed systems have the requirement that
the end user is not at the root level.
The end user is not the root user, the actual root user is
the vendor. And they have convinced the end user that it is in
their best interest to let them send real-time updates. ``We
can make you more secure if we can identify a threat somewhere
else, and then update your system without you hitting yes or no
on the screen. Just let us go ahead, at the root level, and
update your system, and we can make you safer if you allow us
to do that.'' Well, that is not always the case, and that is
the vulnerability that oftentimes makes a small exploit turn
into a giant one.
So, Mr. Kessler, I think you are wise to encourage and
solicit diversity of solutions from your students, and I wish
we had more diversity of solutions allowed into procurement
policies.
And I yield back.
Mr. Burchett. Mr. Chairman, my intellect is so much
superior to Thomas Massie's, that is why I had him deliver
those questions, so that the average citizen could understand
them. And I yield back the remainder of my time.
Mr. Auchincloss. The gentleman yields. The Chair recognizes
himself for 5 minutes.
I want to continue to pull on the thread of water
infrastructure. We know that our water infrastructure in the
country needs serious improvement. In Massachusetts alone, we
have got between $10 to $15 billion of a maintenance backlog
for water potability and riverine and littoral resilience.
I submitted four projects to the House Appropriations
Committee requesting funding for critical water projects in
Massachusetts. And, unlike Boston, which has the scale and the
scope to have a sophisticated IT component to its water and
sewer public works, these towns are small, and they don't
necessarily have those kinds of resources, and have the ability
to have that type of expertise on standby.
So, in addition to making investments in water potability
itself, we need to be making investments in securing that
critical infrastructure from cyberattacks.
Mr. Sullivan, the Boston Water and Sewer Commission, where
you are the chief engineer, as you said, has suffered from a
ransomware attack last year. And in your testimony you noted
that, because the business network was segregated from the
control system, there was never any threat to public or
environmental health.
And just to give you a sense of the divergence, in terms of
Boston's scale and some of the towns in my district, Norton,
which is a town that recently launched a new, $11 million water
treatment plant in February 2020 that has been exceptionally
effective, that has a base of about 20,000 residents. Boston
has a base of about 675,000 residents, so two orders of
magnitude here, almost.
Has the Boston Water and Sewer Commission been able to
communicate with these smaller Massachusetts entities about
best practices, should they be attacked, or even been able to
form a collaborative regional working group, so that there is
some sort of umbrella protection from the bigger cities?
Mr. Sullivan. Well, we work with all the Massachusetts--
through the Mass WARN system, should something come up. But we
recommend to them that they actually join the WaterISAC,
because you get national exposure.
It is difficult sometimes, when an entity as large as ours
is talking, and we talk about, ``You should buy this, buy
that,'' and the smaller towns go, ``How are we going to afford
it, and who is going to run it?'' So, it is better that they go
to a national one, who has like-size utilities, where we can
put them in touch with them, and they can communicate on the
same level how they took care of it, because we do operate in
different levels of scope.
The treatment systems are all the same. It is the size of
the system, and whether it is fully automated, or whether you
have a 24/7 operator watching the screen, as Oldsmar did. I
mean, they happened to be lucky. They watched the screen, and
it was moving because someone got in on their system.
The other problem we have with some of the smaller systems
is they want to tie into the internet, so they can use things
like TeamViewer, which was at Oldsmar, so that they can operate
these remotely. During COVID, it was one of the biggest things:
How can I run my automated plant remotely?
So, we have got to get away from that. We have got to get
them down to a much securer system that is run where the OT is
totally separate from the IT. And we do talk to the different
communities, and we are always open. But again, we try to refer
them to someone of like size who has had the same problems.
Mr. Auchincloss. So, if I could recapitulate what you are
saying here, it is--you would encourage them to join WaterISAC,
you would encourage them to separate--or to not permit a remote
operation, to require onsite operation.
Any further recommendations that you would give to smaller
towns, IT departments in particular?
Mr. Sullivan. Well, one of the other problems is, in small
towns, the IT department may reside at the townhall, and not
necessarily with the water or wastewater department. And so,
they communicate occasionally, but they don't really live the
IT issues. And that we see in many of the small towns, it is
part of city government, town government.
And I am not aware exactly how the Norton system is set up,
if there is even an IT expert working for the water department.
Many times, it is someone released to them from the town. So, I
would need to look into it.
Mr. Auchincloss. Mr. Sullivan, I appreciate the answers and
the work that you are doing to ensure the resilience of our
water infrastructure in Massachusetts.
The Chair yields the balance of his time, and the Chair
recognizes the gentlelady from Puerto Rico, Miss Gonzalez-
Colon.
[Pause.]
Mr. Auchincloss. The Chair recognizes Mr. Guest.
Mr. Guest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
To our panel, Congress has tasked CISA, the Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency, as the lead agency in both
protecting our cyber and defending against any cyber threats
and cyberattacks. I would like, if the panel would, to please
provide any information, any insight with your interaction with
CISA, the benefits that they have provided, and any
shortcomings that you see that may exist between CISA's
interaction and the interaction with your industry or your
particular company.
[Pause.]
Mr. Kessler. Since nobody else is jumping in, I will jump
in.
The interactions that I have had with CISA actually have
been primarily through Coast Guard colleagues who are doing
tours at CISA. I think CISA has started to take a lead role
with Coast Guard in some of the protections in ports. I think
they have done a really good job at trying to get the word out
and take that role.
I have also some colleagues in the energy field, who are
doing some work with CISA.
The work that I have seen from CISA and the output from the
agency seems to be appropriate. You know, there is always more
that we can do. I think that is one of the recurring themes
here. But I think they have done an excellent job, and I don't
really have anything I would point to right now and say that
they are deficient.
Ms. Samford. This is Megan Samford. I am happy to comment
on that, as well.
I applaud Department of Homeland Security and CISA,
actually. I think that they have a tremendous mission. I think
that their scope is one of the largest that the Federal
Government has.
It has been my experience that, especially when dealing
with vulnerability handling and coordination, the entity--I
think the name has changed now, but it used to be known as ICS-
CERT out in Idaho. Despite any company I have worked with over
the past decade, I have been able to call that team, and we
have been able to work through issues. They have always been at
the ready.
Mark Bristow, who currently leads their hunting team there,
he is also an advocate. He is one of the other four people that
are currently credentialed as an incident commander for cyber
under the FEMA system.
They believe the construct can work. They do a really good
job at templating exercise material response plans. In many
cases, I think that these materials are underutilized, or the
private sector simply isn't educated on. If the private sector
were more educated on the resources available through CISA, I
think that we would see greater utilization of that agency. But
I hold them in very high regard.
Can agencies improve? Yes, of course. But my interactions
with that entity have been very good.
Mr. Guest. And Ms. Samford, let me follow up on it just a
little bit. You talked a little bit about the raising
awareness, the education of CISA. What can Congress do to make
sure that we are educating our businesses, educating our key
industries on, first, the existence of CISA, because I think
many people have never heard of CISA. If you are not in the
homeland security realm, CISA is just another acronym, and you
have no idea what it stands for.
But with the recent cyberattacks that we have seen, and the
threats of growing cyberattacks, whether that be criminal
elements, rogue nations who are using cyberattacks to--either
espionage, ransomware--what can we, as Congress, do to better
educate?
Because what we want people to do is we want them to be
aware of CISA, of what the benefits CISA has to offer when
there is an attack. We would like for them then to report that
to CISA, so that we can investigate and try to go forward.
And so, do you have any thoughts on what we can do to,
again, improve that awareness of this agency?
Ms. Samford. Sure, thank you. Thank you, and that is a
great question.
I believe that any public show of support for CISA and its
efforts, I think that that is a tremendous deal.
I can tell you there was one program in particular that I
think CISA and Department of Homeland Security have been
especially successful at since the Department was stood up, and
that is the Protective Security Adviser program.
The Commonwealth of Virginia--I was actually working in the
Governor's office of Tim Kaine at the time, but Virginia was
the first State to have a pilot program for protective security
advisers, and now every State has at least one protective
security adviser.
But this individual, that is exactly what their job is, is
they go out to the designated critical infrastructures, and
they do physical security site assessments. And now I
understand that CISA has cybersecurity advisers that accompany
the protective security advisers. And so, they are kind of two
in a box, visiting these infrastructures, wastewater treatment
facilities, you name it, and they are talking about the
different programs that CISA can offer to them.
So, I think any public show of endorsement for these
programs and CISA and the direct interaction with the private
sector is definitely appreciated at all levels.
Mr. Guest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman----
Mr. Auchincloss. The gentleman's time has expired.
Mr. Guest [continuing]. I am over time, I yield back.
Mr. Auchincloss. Thank you, the gentleman yields, and that
concludes our hearing.
I would like to thank each of our witnesses for your
testimony today. Your comments were informative and helpful.
I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing
remain open until such time as our witnesses have provided
answers to any questions that may be submitted to them in
writing.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 days for any additional comments and information
submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in the record
of today's hearing.
Without objection so ordered.
The committee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 1:19 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Frederica S. Wilson, a Representative in
Congress from the State of Florida
Thank you, Chairman DeFazio for today's hearing.
Gaps in the transportation sector's ability to defend, detect, and
respond to cybersecurity incidents threaten residents of Florida and
the nation at large.
For example, the cyberattack on the Oldsmar water treatment
facility had the potential to contaminate drinking water for 15,000
Florida residents.
Improving cybersecurity needs to be a top priority through strong
industry and governmental partnerships and effective standards to avert
attacks on facilities and systems, such as the Turkey Point Nuclear
Generating Station located in South Florida.
In addition, we must take actionable steps to increase our
cybersecurity workforce and work to make these jobs accessible for all
communities.
I look forward to working with my colleagues and the private sector
to enhance our nation's cybersecurity preparedness, increase the
cybersecurity workforce, and protect citizens.
With that, I have a few questions.

Appendix

----------

Question from Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson to Scott Belcher, President
and Chief Executive Officer, SFB Consulting, LLC, on behalf of Mineta
Transportation Institute

Question 1. Mr. Belcher: What amount of funding do you believe
Congress should provide to assist individual transit agencies, like
Dallas Area Rapid Transit, with increasing their cybersecurity
programs?
Answer. Most transit agencies do not currently have the necessary
funding to effectively begin addressing their cybersecurity needs.
Unfortunately, there is not a specific amount that each transit agency
should receive because each transit agency is unique and is at a
different level of cyber maturity. Factors that should be considered
when determining how much an individual agency should invest in
cybersecurity preparedness include the risk and threats posed to the
organization and the risk tolerance of the organization. At a minimum,
transit agencies should have an understanding of the cyber risk and
threats posed to their organization, and have assessed their current
cyber risk program based on their risk tolerance. This resulting
understanding of cyber risk should be factored into the agency's
business continuity planning and incident response plans. If a transit
agency has not taken these steps, then funding should be provided to
help with these fundamentals. The understanding of cyber risk will also
inform an estimate of the agency's immediate and long-term capital
needs. As a start, Congress should provide funding for each agency to
conduct a cyber risk assessment and integrate its assessment into its
business continuity planning and incident response plans. These basics
would then enable each agency to effectively convey their needs for
additional resources for an ongoing cyber risk program to effectively
mitigate and manage their identified cyber risk.

Question 2. Mr. Belcher: In your testimony, you mentioned that
``one of the key foundations for cybersecurity programs across any
industry comes from the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.''
a.  Why is this agency's cybersecurity framework important and how
can it be improved?
Answer. The foundation for much of the United States' cybersecurity
efforts, including those of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
and U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT), is the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework
(NIST Framework). NIST is a non-regulatory agency: it has no authority
to dictate the use of any particular standard. However, when there is a
matter of public good that depends on establishing a standard, NIST
convenes relevant public and private stakeholders to develop a
standard, as they have done in the face of cybersecurity threats.
In February 2014, NIST released the NIST Framework for Improving
Critical Infrastructure Security in response to Presidential Executive
Order 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity,\1\ which
called for a standardized security framework for critical
infrastructure in the United States. It is not a how-to guide for
cybersecurity; rather, it is a framework designed to help a wide range
of organizations assess risk and make sound decisions about
prioritizing and allocating resources to reduce the risk of compromise
or failure among their systems.

critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For any industry or organization to leverage the NIST Framework,
customized implementation is required in ways that are not necessarily
obvious from the document. An entire industry has emerged of
cybersecurity practitioners, software tools, consultants and advisors
that leverages the NIST Framework as its basis for delivering services
to its customers. For the transportation sector to effectively leverage
the wares of this growing industry, it too must support the use of the
NIST Framework.

Questions from Hon. Colin Z. Allred to Scott Belcher, President and
Chief Executive Officer, SFB Consulting, LLC, on behalf of Mineta
Transportation Institute

Question 3. Mr. Belcher, in your testimony you mentioned the
importance of cybersecurity preparedness and support for cybersecurity
programs, as well as possibly using both a carrot and stick approach to
ensure that public and private entities are using the necessary
resources. What carrots and sticks do you recommend? And what minimum
cybersecurity standards do you believe every transit company, both
public and private, should adopt?
Answer. In the Mineta Transportation Institute (MTI) study entitled
``Is the Transit Industry Prepared for the Cyber Revolution? Policy
Recommendations to Enhance Surface Transit Cyber Preparedness,'' \2\ my
colleagues and I provide a number of recommendations that fall into
each category. In the ``carrot'' category, we recommended that:

Prepared for the Cyber Revolution? Policy Recommendations to Enhance
Surface Transit Cyber Preparedness, https://transweb.sjsu.edu/sites/
default/files/1939-Belcher-Transit-Industry-Cyber-Preparedness.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Congress should increase formula grant funding to transit
agencies to ensure that they have sufficient resources to meet the
minimal cybersecurity standards established above

Congress should increase funding to DHS and U.S. DOT to
develop and promulgate a set of minimal cybersecurity standards and
tools and to help with their promotion

DHS and U.S. DOT should provide technical guidance to
transit agencies on the collection, retention, and assessment of system
logs

The American Public Transportation Association (APTA),
working with other stakeholders, should develop a clearinghouse for
cybersecurity best practices, in particular for small and medium
transit operations

APTA, working with other stakeholders, should create
minimum guidelines for cybersecurity audits

APTA, working with other stakeholders, should develop
model cybersecurity contract language for agencies to integrate into
their vendor contracts

APTA, working with other stakeholders, should develop a
model incident response plan, business continuity plan, continuity of
operations plan, crisis communications plan, and disaster recovery plan
that can be tailored to meet the needs of public transit organizations
of varying sizes and needs

APTA, working with other stakeholders, should continue to
develop cybersecurity training modules and certificates

In the ``stick'' category, we recommend that:

Congress should ensure through its oversight powers that
U.S. DOT and DHS work together to improve cybersecurity preparedness
within the Transportation Systems Sector (TSS)

DHS and U.S. DOT, the TSS co-sector specific agencies for
transit, working with input from APTA and other industry organizations,
should promulgate a set of minimum cybersecurity standards

The Federal Transportation Administration (FTA), working
with DHS, should create an attestation program, whereby transit CEOs
are required to attest that their organization has met the minimum
cybersecurity standards established above prior to receiving federal
funds

FTA, working with DHS and other relevant federal
agencies, should require that transit agencies either outsource
management of payment data to Payment Card Industry (PCI)-compliant
vendors, or require that their CEO attest that they are PCI-compliant
prior to receiving federal funds

Question 4. Mr. Belcher, in your testimony you also mentioned the
different agencies that provide cybersecurity preparedness support or
guidance. In the transportation space, these agencies include the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), DOT, Homeland Security and
TSA as critical cybersecurity players. While some of these agencies do
not have regulatory authority, are there any concerns with having so
many different agencies responsible for leading different cybersecurity
efforts?
Answer. On February 12, 2013, the White House released Presidential
Policy Directive 21 outlining the federal government's responsibility
to strengthen the security and resilience of U.S. critical
infrastructure against both physical and cyber threats.\3\ The
Directive established that DHS and U.S. DOT share responsibility for
the TSS. In sharing this role, the DHS's and U.S. DOT's
responsibilities include:

Collaborating with critical infrastructure owners and
operators

Coordinating with state, local, tribal, and territorial
entities to implement the directive

Providing, supporting, or facilitating technical
assistance and consultations to identify vulnerabilities and help
mitigate incidents in the sector

While there are multiple agencies providing guidance in this space,
it was not until December 2021, that TSA issued Transportation Security
Directive 1582-21-01, ``Enhancing Public Transportation and Railroad
Cybersecurity'' \4\ applying to Public Transport/Public Rail owners and
operators and required that they:

and Railroad Cybersecurity, effective December 31, 2021, https://

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Designate a cybersecurity coordinator

Report cyber incidents to CISA within 24 hours of
detection

Complete a vulnerability assessments of their networks;
and

Develop a cybersecurity incident response plan based on
security issues discovered

The FTA was part of the deliberations that led to the release of
this Transportation Security Directive. I believe that this is the
beginning of the new Administration's approach to cybersecurity and is
likely to be the first of a series of Security Directives and/or
regulations. I believe that working together, the TSA and the U.S. DOT
as co-leads for this TSS, are the appropriate bodies to issue any
mandatory requirements for the transit industry. Combined, they have a
thorough understanding of appropriate cybersecurity protective measures
and an in-depth understanding of the industry.

Question 5. If so, which of these agencies should take the lead and
what kind of restructuring should occur?
Answer. See answer above.

Question from Hon. Frederica S. Wilson to Megan Samford, Vice
President, Chief Product Security Officer-Energy Management, Schneider
Electric, on behalf of the International Society of Automation Global
Cybersecurity Alliance

Question 1. Ms. Samford: Thank you so much for your testimony. I
agree with your position that a bipartisan effort is necessary to
effectively implement the Incident Command System for Industrial
Control Systems at scale.
a.  Please explain the importance of private and public sectors
working together to effectively manage cyber incidents.
Answer. The ICS4ICS program is creating Incident Command System
capabilities that will enable private companies of various sizes to
improve their response to cybersecurity incidents, especially those
with Operational Technology and Industrial Control Systems. It will
also create a consistent process for the US Department of Homeland
Security to interface with, and support responses in the private
sector. Today, no such process exists to ensure common terms,
processes, and tools. The following critical infrastructure sectors
heavily depend on Industrial Control Systems for their operations:
chemical, energy, and pipelines; water and wastewater; critical
manufacturing; dams; transportation including streetlights, aviation,
and public transportation; and buildings that support hospitals,
government agencies, and private companies. 85% of the critical
infrastructure of the United States is owned and operated by private
companies. The remaining 15% are owned and operated by local, state,
tribal, and federal government agencies. ICS4ICS is based on an
informal public-private partnership with FEMA and DHS who have
contributed significant capabilities and resources to the ICS4ICS
program.
ICS4ICS membership is continuing to expand rapidly with 700
individuals currently on our distribution list. ISAGCA has funded this
private sector effort to develop ICS4ICS but will not be able to meet
the funding needs as the program expands. ICS4ICS was developed by
leveraging FEMA and DHS capabilities, processes, and tools. Currently,
ICS4ICS is focused on Type 3 (single-company, single-site/asset)
incidents. The program will be expanded in 2022 to address Type 2
(single-company, multiple sites/assets) incidents. ICS4ICS will not be
able to address nation-wide incident (Type 1) without a formal public-
private partnership. DHS CISA currently provides information about
cyber-attacks and will need to expand their coordination role in a
nation-wide attack impacting an entire critical infrastructure sector
or possibly multiple sectors. ICS4ICS will enable public and private
parties to work together more easily because they will have common
terms, processes, and tools. ICS4ICS will also enable public and
private companies to establish mutual aid agreements through
credentialling of ICS4ICS staff based on roles and by having a common
methodology.

Question from Hon. Colin Z. Allred to Megan Samford, Vice President,
Chief Product Security Officer-Energy Management, Schneider Electric,
on behalf of the International Society of Automation Global
Cybersecurity Alliance

Question 2. We often only hear or see reporting on the most well-
known attacks against larger companies like Colonial Pipeline, but
smaller businesses and companies are potentially more vulnerable to
attacks than larger companies. Ms. Samford, what additional resources
should the federal government provide to smaller businesses?
Answer. The federal government should recommend the use of the FEMA
Incident Command System to the private sector, and in particular,
smaller businesses because it will greatly aid in helping them create
incident response plans, common terminology, as well as a framework for
working with the federal government when they need support. FEMA has
numerous Incident Command Systems tools, templates, and training that
can be leveraged by public and private sector small or large. The
ICS4ICS tools and templates could be added to the FEMA site and
customized for small businesses. The DHS Control System Exercise
Package could be leveraged as a model to create an ICS4ICS Exercise
Package for small businesses. Some of the ICS4ICS tools and templates
should be updated to address the needs of small businesses and align
with the DHS Exercise Package for small businesses. A registry could be
established for parties willing to provide mutual aid which would
likely significantly benefit small businesses who don't have the
procurement staff to create these types of agreements. FEMA classroom
training course information could be widely shared with small
businesses which would allow them to participate for free when extra
seats are available.

Question from Hon. Frederica S. Wilson to Thomas L. Farmer, Assistant
Vice President-Security, Association of American Railroads

Question 1. Mr. Farmer: Thank you for your testimony. I want to
applaud the collaboration of railroads in their efforts to strengthen
cybersecurity. I am the current sponsor of a rail safety resolution
that is introduced every year. And even though it focuses on
collisions, in 2022, a cybersecurity element may be needed. In your
testimony, you mention that TSA directives are unnecessary and can
undermine the work the rail industry has done over the last 20 years.
a.  You indicate the benefit of a collaboration between government
and the rail industry. How would government mandates erode the benefit
of this collaboration, especially if these mandates would protect this
critical industry?
Answer. Representative Wilson: Thank you very much for your
commendation of the collaborative efforts that railroads maintain, and
strive continuously to enhance, to protect networks and assure safe and
resilient operations. As your question indicates, the railroads value
collaboration not only among freight and passenger railroads, but also
with other transportation modes, other industries, and government
agencies.
Our unwavering focus is on assuring timely access to assessments,
analyses, and reporting on cyber threats and incidents to inform
vigilance; and on having the capability to detect cyber-attacks and
prevent breaches. It is vital that railroads be flexible and nimble to
counter an ever-evolving threat.
AAR's general concern with government mandates is that they
potentially undercut the railroads' efforts to be prepared for cyber-
attacks. Government mandates inevitably alter the nature and quality of
the interaction between government and industry. The priority shifts
from what can be attained collaboratively for cybersecurity enhancement
to complying with the terms of the mandates--what actions are expressly
required and whether the covered organization has implemented all
mandated measures.
Regarding the recent security directives, AAR's cyber team worked
tirelessly with the TSA and other federal stakeholders to make
significant revisions to shape the directives into what they are today:
1.  designate a cybersecurity coordinator;
2.  report cybersecurity incidents to CISA within 24 hours;
3.  develop and implement a cybersecurity incident response plan to
reduce the risk of an operational disruption; and,
4.  complete a cybersecurity vulnerability assessment to identify
potential gaps or vulnerabilities in their systems.

AAR does not object to the substance of these mandates. As a matter
of fact, the railroads are already substantially in compliance.
However, the process by which the mandates was issued was not ideal.
The public notice and comment period used to promulgate federal
regulations would have afforded ample time and opportunity to address
these matters and produced a stronger outcome overall. Railroads take
cyber threats seriously. We value our productive work with government
partners to keep the rail network safe from cyber and physical
threats--as we have done for decades and will continue to do for many
more.

Questions from Hon. Frederica S. Wilson to Michael A. Stephens, General
Counsel and Executive Vice President for Information Technology,
Hillsborough County Aviation Authority, Tampa International Airport

Question 1. Mr. Stephens: Thank you for your testimony. Adopting a
non-voluntary cybersecurity mitigation strategy can be effective in
preventing attacks on airports, airlines, and critical aviation
information systems.
a.  Please explain the significance and need for implementing a
non-voluntary, baseline cybersecurity standard to best protect the
aviation industry.
Answer. As attacks and threats become more prevalent and damaging,
we cannot afford as a nation for our critical infrastructure sectors to
experience a catastrophic event before we
The current posture for many critical infrastructure entities is to
be often reactive rather than proactive when mitigating cyber risks--
for example, delaying essential mitigation activities such as patching
and updates. This reactive posture is usually not because of lack of
willingness but is often due to low prioritization or financial
constraints. The reactive post, in my opinion, also occurs because
there is often no oversight or requirement to do so. However, I believe
that we are at an inflection point where this is no longer acceptable.
The most apparent benefit of mandatory standards is that they
incentivize entities to actively implement the necessary measures,
processes, and policies for an improved security posture, thereby
reducing the risk of an entity getting breached. If a breach occurs, it
significantly increases the chances that the entity will be better
prepared with incident responses and continuity plans to minimize
damage and mitigate risks.

Question 2. Mr. Stephens: You state that ``closing the human
factors gap is a critical and integral part of a successful and
effective cyber resilience strategy,'' and suggest a uniform standard
that establishes a minimum baseline training requirement.
a.  What would an ideal baseline standard look like from your
perspective?
Answer. It is my opinion that standards currently exist that
airports and key aviation sector stakeholders can easily adopt that to
enhance their cybersecurity preparedness and resiliency. These
standards include guidance that focuses on ``human factors,'' such a
reoccurring awareness and preparedness training related to cyber
threats. As discussed during the hearing, the NIST standard and the
COBIT 5 standard offer excellent opportunities for airports to build
robust threat mitigation and cybersecurity programs.
It is important to note that airports are very different with
respect to their organization and operations. Therefore, a one-size-
fits-all approach would be highly inadvisable, and I believe,
ineffective. The TSA and the FAA can begin to more actively encourage
airports to adopt and implement a standard of the airport or
stakeholders' choice as a component of their System Security Plan.
Airport stakeholders should be given the flexibility to adopt standards
and mitigation measures that best fit their unique structures and
risks.

Question from Hon. Colin Z. Allred to Michael A. Stephens, General
Counsel and Executive Vice President for Information Technology,
Hillsborough County Aviation Authority, Tampa International Airport

Question 3. Mr. Stephens, as the government puts more focus on
cybersecurity preparedness measures, how do you suggest that we
incentivize private companies to address cybersecurity issues in the
aviation sector?
Answer. I believe that, where appropriate, incentives are often the
preferable path to adopting and accepting cyber security standards as
opposed to mandates in the aviation sector. A few areas where I believe
there is an opportunity are the Federal grants process. Entities that
have demonstrated greater preparedness, whether through the adoption or
implementation of cyber standards, could potentially be given more
significant consideration. Grant programs such as the FAA's programs on
workforce development, AIP program, or other grant programs for safety
and security enhancements are potential starting points.
Moreover, cyber requirements should be embedded into the
procurement process where Federal funds are involved over a certain
dollar threshold. This would potentially incentivize private sector
entities who wish to do business with airports to focus on
cybersecurity preparedness measures. Another incentive could come in
the form of limiting liability for cybersecurity breaches under current
law in exchange for implementing certain baseline standards.

Questions from Hon. Frederica S. Wilson to John P. Sullivan, P.E.,
Chief Engineer, Boston Water and Sewer Commission, on behalf of the
Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center

Question 1. Mr. Sullivan: Thank you for your testimony. You
highlight that there is no statutory requirement for wastewater systems
to take an ``all-hazards'' look at potential threats, including cyber
risk. Furthermore, you discuss the development of a wastewater sector
program, like the EPA's oversight of drinking water.
a.  What legislative approach to federal oversight of wastewater
systems would you recommend, and how would it incorporate
cybersecurity?
Answer. While WaterISAC takes no position on the federal regulation
of the cybersecurity practices of wastewater systems, my testimony
notes that America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-270)
requires drinking water utilities, under the oversight of EPA, to
periodically take an ``all-hazards'' look at potential threats,
including risks to ``electronic, computer, or other automated
systems.'' Subject matter experts have noted that Congress could
consider extending this same requirement to the nation's wastewater
systems, directing them to similarly make periodic evaluations of their
cybersecurity posture. While some assistance may be necessary to help
small wastewater systems complete this task, other wastewater systems--
such as those that are part of joint utilities with drinking water
systems--could likely fulfill this requirement fairly easily. This
would also serve to put both drinking water and wastewater systems on
equal regulatory footing, in terms of physical and cybersecurity
requirements, thus providing the entire water sector with a consistent
baseline on which to build any future security policies.

Question 2. Mr. Sullivan: A Water Sector Coordinating Council
survey found that nearly 40 percent of respondents did not have
cybersecurity as part of their risk management plans; many of them were
smaller water and wastewater systems that lack the funding and
expertise.
a.  What can be done to provide these smaller systems with
resources and technical assistance to make cybersecurity a meaningful
part of their operations?
Answer. One of the most effective things the federal government can
do to help small water and wastewater systems improve their
cybersecurity posture is to offer voluntary technical assistance and
financial aid to connect these small systems with best practices and
information sharing resources that are available in the water sector.
For example, my testimony notes that the recently enacted
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act authorizes a new Department of
Energy program that aims to improve the cyber resilience of utilities
in the bulk power sector. Specifically, the new program will facilitate
the delivery of technical assistance and work to expand participation
in the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center, which is
WaterISAC's counterpart in the electricity sector. I believe a similar
EPA program, focused on offering cybersecurity technical assistance to
small water and wastewater systems, while also supporting the
membership of these systems in WaterISAC, could greatly increase the
cyber awareness of water systems from coast to coast. This, in turn,
will help the operators of these systems become aware of the threat
landscape, protect themselves against cyber attacks, and implement
measures that make their water systems less vulnerable.

Question from Hon. Garret Graves to John P. Sullivan, P.E., Chief
Engineer, Boston Water and Sewer Commission, on behalf of the Water
Information Sharing and Analysis Center

Question 3. Earlier this year we saw that impact of a hack into a
water system in Oldsmar Florida (near Tampa), with the hacker
increasing the amount of sodium hydroxide (lye) in the water by a
factor of more than 100 (FYI sodium hydroxide is the main ingredient in
liquid drain cleaners like Drano , in smaller quantities it tempers
the water's acidity).
During the first reconciliation markup and on the floor, I offered
an amendment which would have authorized $50 million for an EPA grant
program to help municipalities keep their systems secure. This
amendment was not adopted by the committee or by the full House.
Do you think that this amendment would have been helpful to
safeguard drinking water from hackers?
Answer. While I am not familiar with the specific details of that
amendment, water and wastewater systems would certainly benefit from
additional EPA aid to keep their systems secure against threats from
cyberspace and elsewhere. In fact, two provisions included in the
recently enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act would make
progress toward this goal. Sections 50107 and 50205 of that new law
authorize respective drinking water and wastewater utility resilience
and sustainability programs at EPA to help utilities undertake projects
to protect against cyber threats, extreme weather events, and other
natural hazards. Funding these and similar programs to increase water
and wastewater system preparedness to a range of threats would
certainly help all utilities become more secure.

Question from Hon. Frederica S. Wilson to Gary C. Kessler, Ph.D.,
Nonresident Senior Fellow, Atlantic Council

Question 1. Dr. Kessler: Thank you so much for your testimony. You
highlighted the significant uptick in cyberattacks targeting the
Maritime Transportation System. This is a very important issue to me
because PortMiami is located in South Florida. I agree that a focus on
mitigating cyber risks should not only target threats, but also
vulnerabilities.
a.  You stated that a critical defensive tactic is related to
intelligence sharing. Why is information sharing so important for
defending against cyberattacks and ensuring that all organizations,
regardless of size, can safeguard themselves?
Answer. Thank you, Congresswoman Wilson, for this question. We
address this issue in the Atlantic Council report, as Recommendation
#3, one of the high priority responses that we believe will elevate the
effectiveness of cybersecurity practices. It is an issue near and dear
to my heart.
Information and intelligence sharing works on at least a couple of
levels. First, the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) has at least
the same cyber issues as all other users of computers and technology.
Given all of the cyber issues that are common to everyone, then it just
makes sense to openly share known vulnerabilities in software and
hardware. These efforts are already largely in place with programs such
as MITRE's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database, NIST's
National Vulnerability Database (NVD), and periodic cybersecurity
warnings from CISA and vendors.
Within the MTS, we can be more open in sharing particular threats
against our industry and computer systems specific to maritime. Indeed,
sharing actual case studies of attacks that have occurred and the
lessons learned would be very valuable to the entire community.
There are those who opine that openly sharing vulnerabilities
informs the Bad Guys and does not give vendors enough time to fix the
problems. I would observe that historically, for at least the last 30
years on the public Internet, the attacker community has always been
better informed than the target community. Keeping vulnerabilities
secret from potential victims while waiting for vendors to create a
patch leaves a lot of systems unaware, unarmed, at risk, and unable to
take any potential protective measures on their own.
Secondly, while I believe that we need to focus on cyber
vulnerabilities, we also need to be cognizant of all threats directed
at us. By way of example, if I was the Port of Miami, I would be
interested in any and all threat intelligence directed at anything
related to my organization's operation, including threats against:

The MTS, in general;

Ports, in general, or my port, in particular;

Any ship or shipping line doing business in my port;

Any inter-modal carrier with a presence at my port;

The U.S., Florida, Miami-Dade County, or the City of
Miami;

Any port personnel, officers of the Miami-Dade Seaport
Department, or any other officials or officers associated with
PortMiami (all identified, by the way, in the port's Annual Report,
available online); or

Industry meetings, particularly those related to port
operations.

The community of attackers--and the attackers do communicate and
share information--is very informed and have bad intentions. Potential
victims need to be armed with as much information as possible in as
timely a fashion as possible.
Please let me know if I can provide any other information or
clarification.

BACKGROUND

CYBERTHREATS TO THE U.S. TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS

Cyberattacks are a serious and evolving risk that affect
transportation and infrastructure matters across T&I's
jurisdiction. Cyberattacks can result in tremendous financial
damage, destruction of infrastructure assets, and even
death.\1\ They impact governments, businesses, and individuals
alike and have been growing in number and sophistication.\2\
This hearing is the second of two full committee hearings on
cybersecurity of the nation's infrastructure.\3\ The first
hearing was held in November 2021 and featured testimony from
industry stakeholders and cybersecurity experts.\4\ As
discussed in the November hearing, cyberattacks on the nation's
critical infrastructure--about 85 percent of which is owned and
operated by private entities \5\--can cause significant harm to
the public. However, many private entities, as well as federal
agencies, have not taken the necessary steps to prevent,
prepare for, respond to, and recover from cyberattacks.\6\
During the Committee's November hearing, witnesses discussed
challenges that hamper infrastructure operators' preparedness
and resilience, such as a shortage of qualified information
technology staff, a lack of appropriate cybersecurity awareness
training, and insufficient technical expertise.\7\
Responsibility for cybersecurity of the nation's infrastructure
is shared among many entities, including the federal
government, state and local entities, and public and private
infrastructure owners and operators.\8\

This hearing will feature federal witnesses and focus on
(1) actions the federal government is taking to address
cybersecurity and preparedness of the transportation and
infrastructure sectors, and (2) challenges agencies face in
securing their own computer networks and the steps they are
taking to address these challenges and to implement recent
federal cybersecurity directives and other actions.

FEDERAL AGENCIES WITH A ROLE IN TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE
CYBERSECURITY

In 2013, the federal government established a framework to
guide the cybersecurity efforts of critical infrastructure
owners and operators, which is set forth in the National
Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) 2013: Partnering for
Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience.\9\ The plan
organizes critical infrastructure into 16 sectors and
designates a federal department or agency as the lead
coordinator--or sector risk management agency--for each
sector.\10\

INFORMATION SHARING AND ANALYSIS CENTERS

In addition to the above-mentioned federal assistance for
cybersecurity, private industry offers assistance through
sector-specific Information Sharing and Analysis Centers
(ISAC). The concept of ISACs was first promulgated in
Presidential Decision Directive-63 (PDD-63), signed on May 22,
1998.\18\ Today the National Council of ISACs recognizes 26
industry specific ISAC organizations.\19\ Typically, ISACs are
nonprofit organizations that share information about threats,
vulnerabilities, and mitigation within their particular
sector.\20\ Some also provide awareness training and assistance
in responding to cyber and other security incidents.\21\

For example, in the water sector, the Water Information
Sharing and Analysis Center (WaterISAC) partners with various
organizations, including the American Water Works Association,
the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, and the
National Rural Water Association.\22\ WaterISAC also maintains
close contact with government agencies to access sensitive and
classified security information.\23\ WaterISAC acts as an
information clearinghouse and provides analysis and resources
to its members to ``support response, mitigation, and
resilience initiatives.'' \24\

FEDERAL CYBERSECURITY PREPAREDNESS AND INTERNAL WEAKNESSES

While the federal government supports private actors
regarding cybersecurity in critical infrastructure, significant
work is needed within federal government agencies to improve
their own cybersecurity defenses. In March 2021, GAO identified
ten critical actions needed to address major cybersecurity
challenges.\25\ The ten urgent needs fell under four major
cybersecurity challenges previously identified by GAO,
specifically: (1) Establishing a comprehensive cybersecurity
strategy and performing effective oversight; (2) Securing
federal systems and information; (3) Protecting cyber critical
infrastructure; and (4) Protecting privacy and sensitive
data.\26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\25\ GAO, ``Federal Government Needs to Urgently Pursue Critical
Actions to Address Major Cybersecurity Challenges,'' (March 2021), p.
9, available at https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-288.pdf
\26\ Id. at p. 8.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The report also noted that establishing the Office of the
National Cyber Director within the Executive Office of the
President, as Congress did in early 2021, was ``an essential
step forward'' towards addressing cybersecurity.\27\ Further,
the recently passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
directed $21 million for initial funding for this office,
ensuring the federal government will be better situated to
confront the nation's cyber threats and challenges.\28\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, the GAO report also said, ``critical risks remain
on supply chains, workforce management, and emerging
technologies'' and pointed out that in December 2020, ``GAO
reported that none of the 23 agencies in its review had fully
implemented key foundational practices for managing information
and communications technology supply chains.'' \29\ In May
2021, GAO received updates from six of the 23 agencies
regarding actions taken or planned to address its
recommendations.\30\ However, none of the agencies had fully
implemented the recommendations.\31\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The report also highlighted the fact that since 2010, ``GAO
has made nearly 80 recommendations to enhance infrastructure
cybersecurity'' and that ``nearly 50'' of those recommendations
have not been implemented heightening the risk to the nation's
infrastructure.\32\ Overall, since 2010, GAO has issued more
than 3,700 recommendations across the federal government,
including DOT and its subagencies, that could improve the
nation's cybersecurity.\33\ In July 2021, more than 950 of
those recommendations remained unimplemented.\34\

Department of Transportation (DOT)

DOT and its 11 operating administrations and other
components rely on hundreds of information technology systems
for uses as diverse as air traffic control operations,
disbursement of billions of dollars in loans and grants,
managing sensitive personnel data, and many other functions key
to DOT's mission.\35\ The DOT OIG has identified information
security as a top management challenge for the Department and
stated that addressing these weaknesses and strengthening
controls is essential for protecting departmental information
technology (IT) infrastructure and improving DOT's
cybersecurity posture.\36\ These recurring cybersecurity
weaknesses have resulted in key systems being vulnerable to
cyberattacks, takeovers, and data breaches.\37\ In addition, in
the DOT OIG's most recent Top Management Challenges report
released in late October 2021, they found that DOT needs a
``holistic approach with sustained focus and direction'' to
resolve 66 open recommendations the DOT OIG made in previous
audits.\38\ These recommendations are intended to help address
10,663 security weaknesses identified in DOT plans of actions
and milestones.\39\ The DOT OIG has also identified
cybersecurity weaknesses at the component agencies within DOT.
Specific problems the DOT OIG has identified include the
following:

LFederal Transit Administration (FTA). In October
2021, the DOT OIG released a report on cybersecurity weaknesses
of FTA's financial management systems that could affect FTA's
ability to approve, process, and disburse COVID-19 funds.\40\
Among the OIG's findings: FTA has failed to fix security
control weaknesses identified since 2016; it lacks sufficient
contingency planning and incident response capabilities; and it
``does not adequately monitor the security controls provided by
or inherited from DOT's common control provider.'' \41\ The DOT
OIG found that 139 of 269 security controls were not tested or
implemented but reported as satisfied by FTA officials, for
instance, increasing the exposure of FTA's financial management
systems to outside threats.\42\ The DOT OIG made 13
recommendations to correct these and other weaknesses and FTA
has concurred with all of these recommendations.\43\

LFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
(FMCSA). FMCSA regulates and oversees the safety of commercial
vehicles. In October 2021, the DOT OIG issued a report showing
their investigators had exploited vulnerabilities in web
servers at FMCSA that allowed them to gain unauthorized access
to the agency's network.\44\ The agency also failed to detect
the DOT OIG's placement of malware on their network.\45\ DOT
OIG investigators were able to gain access to 13.6 million
unencrypted records with personally identifiable
information.\46\ The DOT OIG estimated that if malicious actors
had obtained this information, it could have cost FMCSA up to
$570 million in credit monitoring fees.\47\ FMCSA did not
detect the breach, in part because it did not use required
automated detection tools and malicious code protections.\48\
The DOT OIG also found that FMCSA does not always remediate
vulnerabilities as quickly as DOT policy requires, putting
FMCSA's network and data at risk for unauthorized access and
compromise.\49\ FMCSA concurred with DOT OIG's 13
recommendations and considers these issues ``resolved but open
pending FMCSA's completion of'' its planned actions.\50\

LFederal Aviation Administration (FAA). In August
2021, the DOT OIG released a report on FAA's efforts to
categorize its high-impact information systems.\51\ The report
found that until recently, the agency's air traffic
organization had never properly categorized its high-impact
security systems, although these systems provide safety-
critical services.\52\ In addition, it found, ``FAA lacks
formalized policies and procedures for selecting and
implementing high security controls for its high-impact systems
and continues to develop mitigations for security risks.'' \53\
The DOT OIG further found that FAA has not completed a required
gap analysis to comply with federal standards for its 45 high-
impact systems ``and is essential for determining whether the
organization's security and privacy risks have been effectively
managed.'' \54\ Finally, the report said, ``FAA has not yet
mitigated the risk that the NAS [National Airspace System]
could be vulnerable to threats as the Agency works to implement
high security controls, because it has not fully implemented
enterprise security initiatives designed to protect NAS
assets.'' \55\

LAviation Cyber Initiative (ACI). ACI is an
interagency collaboration between FAA, the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Defense (DOD)
that was informally established in 2016.\56\ Its objectives
include identifying and analyzing cyber threats and
vulnerabilities, engaging with aviation stakeholders to help
reduce cyber risks, and seeking opportunities to improve risk
mitigation.\57\ Its charter was finally approved in 2019, when
10 priorities were set for 2019 and 2020. The DOT OIG found,
however, that ACI has only implemented three of those
priorities.\58\ In addition, according to GAO, the FAA has not
developed mechanisms to monitor and evaluate cybersecurity
issues that are raised in ACI coordination meetings and FAA's
``oversight coordination activities are not supported by
dedicated resources within'' the FAA's budget.\59\ GAO declared
in a report it released in October 2020: ``Until FAA
establishes a tracking mechanism for cybersecurity issues, it
may be unable to ensure that all issues are appropriately
addressed and resolved. Further, until it conducts an avionics
cybersecurity risk assessment, it will not be able to
effectively prioritize and dedicate resources to ensure that
avionics cybersecurity risks are addressed in its oversight
program.'' \60\ In addition, GAO found more broadly that ``FAA
has not (1) assessed its oversight program to determine the
priority of avionics cybersecurity risks, (2) developed an
avionics cybersecurity training program, (3) issued guidance
for independent cybersecurity testing, or (4) included periodic
testing as part of its monitoring process.'' \61\

United States Coast Guard (Coast Guard or Service)

The aging and underinvested status of the Coast Guard's
cyber systems and IT infrastructure is at a crisis point as was
highlighted during a Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation hearing on November 16, 2021.\62\ The Coast
Guard has historically struggled with IT modernization, and
Commandant Karl Schultz has made it a priority in what the
Coast Guard calls its ``Tech Revolution.'' \63\ The Tech
Revolution road map outlines strategic goals, including
modernizing cybersecurity and cyber resilience.\64\ Currently,
the Coast Guard primarily operates on 1990s-era hardware and
software, running the risk of critical failures even before its
resilience can be challenged by cyber incidents.\65\ In
February 2020, for instance, the Commandant stated that the
Coast Guard's IT infrastructure was at the ``brink of
catastrophic failure'' and highlighted the immediate need for
$300 million in IT spending to modernize the Coast Guard's
technological landscape.\66\

In its 2015 Cyber Strategy, the Coast Guard explained that
in the digital age, their overall mission to ensure the safety,
security, and stewardship of the nation's waters cannot
effectively be met without the Coast Guard maintaining a robust
and comprehensive cyber program.\67\ In 2021, working in close
collaboration with DHS, DOD, government partners, foreign
allies, and the maritime industry, the Coast Guard released its
Cyber Strategic Outlook, an update to its cyber strategy to
improve protection of the Marine Transportation System
(MTS).\68\ The strategic outlook focused on three efforts: (1)
Securing resilient information technology and operational
technology networks to support all Coast Guard missions; (2)
Employing frameworks, standards, and best practices in
prevention and response activities to identify and manage cyber
risks to the MTS; and (3) Projecting advanced cyberspace
capabilities in and through the operating environment enabling
the Service to fight and win across all domains.\69\

The MTS includes waterways, shorelines, ports, shipyards,
facilities, bridges, and other infrastructure throughout the
United States, facilitating $5.4 trillion of economic activity
every year, representing about a quarter of U.S. gross domestic
product.\70\ Over the past year, high-profile cyberattacks into
U.S. networks have included crippling attacks on maritime
infrastructure like the one that hit the Port of Kennewick,
Washington, in November 2020.\71\ The port refused to pay a
$200,000 ransom to cybercriminals who hijacked their computer
systems cutting off emails and other IT systems.\72\ Email
systems were restored by the end of the month, but it took
longer to restore other compromised computer systems.\73\

As the sector risk management agency responsible for
protecting the MTS under DHS's designated critical
infrastructure sectors, the Coast Guard designated its Captains
of Port to ``lead governance by promoting cyber risk
management, accountability, and the development and
implementation of unified response plans.'' \74\ The Coast
Guard also intends to ``refine cybersecurity incident reporting
requirements and promote information sharing to improve the
ability of owners and operators to prepare for, mitigate, and
respond to threats to maritime critical infrastructure.'' \75\

Under the 2021 Cyber Strategic Outlook, the Coast Guard
intends to conduct offensive cyber operations to deny or
degrade adversaries' ability to plan, fund, communicate, or
execute their own cyber operations.\76\ To enable that
capability, the Coast Guard seeks to establish an offensive
Cyber Mission Team, interoperable with DOD cyber forces and
DHS, and requested funding for continued cyber force
development as part of its fiscal year (FY) 2022 budget
request.\77\ Supplementing a Coast Guard Maritime Cyber
Readiness Branch that already consists of three defensive Cyber
Protection Teams, administrative and policy legal challenges
remain for the Coast Guard's future cyber operations
capability.\78\

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)

In February 2021, DHS modified two existing FEMA
Preparedness Grant programs to require recipients to spend at
least 7.5 percent of their awards on improving their
cybersecurity.\79\ This requirement was added to State Homeland
Security Program (SHSP) grants, which received $415 million in
FY 2021 , and Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) grants,
which received $615 million in FY 2021.\80\ State and local
recipients of these grants can use the funding to conduct
cybersecurity training and planning, cybersecurity risk
assessments, and improve their critical infrastructure's
cybersecurity.\81\ In addition, in FY 2021, when FEMA's Port
Security Grant Program (PSGP) offered $100 million in
assistance to state and local governments, applicants were
slated to receive a 20 percent increase in their scores for
addressing Cybersecurity National Priority Areas.\82\ PSGP is
part of a broader FEMA effort to help protect transportation
infrastructure against potential terrorist attacks.\83\

environment, TSA now prepares for cyber-related events like
physical threats, as expressed in its 2018 TSA Cybersecurity
Roadmap.\87\ The roadmap provides the framework for how TSA can
operate in the cyber environment, ensuring the protection of
its data and information technology systems and ensuring the
protection and resilience of the Transportation Systems

In addition to addressing longstanding cybersecurity
vulnerabilities in the nation's private pipeline system, TSA
must also address its own cyber weaknesses that increase the
vulnerability of the nation's pipelines. In July 2021, GAO
highlighted that additional pipeline-related weaknesses remain
in TSA's internal policies.\90\ These weaknesses include (1)
incomplete information in TSA's pipeline risk assessments used
to prioritize pipeline security reviews; and (2) aged protocols
for responding to pipeline security incidents that TSA had not
revised since 2010.\91\ TSA officials concurred with GAO
recommendations in this area and anticipate updating their
policies and guidelines over the next year.\92\ As TSA
considers future directives mandating private sector action
related to critical infrastructure, it is incumbent on TSA to
maintain maximum credibility by fixing and updating its own
cybersecurity policies and processes quickly and
thoroughly.\93\

The CISA is a component agency of DHS and leads national
cybersecurity and infrastructure security efforts.\95\ CISA
helps protect the federal government's computer networks and
partners with stakeholders in the public and private sectors to
help improve cybersecurity and resiliency.\96\ CISA also offers
various services to stakeholders, including infrastructure
assessments and analysis, information sharing between the
public and private sector, training and exercises, and
coordination of situational awareness and response to national
cyber incidents.\97\

However, CISA's actions in some areas have been
criticized.\98\ For instance, CISA is responsible for the
safety, security, and resiliency of the more than 91,000 dams
nationwide, 63 percent of which are privately owned.\99\ Dams
are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats.\100\ In 2016, the DOJ
charged seven hackers linked to the Iranian government with
carrying out a coordinated large scale cyberattack against
dozens of banks and a small dam outside New York City.\101\ In
September 2021, the DHS OIG evaluated CISA's oversight of the
Dams Sector and warned, ``when they fail, the effects create a
cascade of water inundation and flooding to buildings and
agriculture, loss of power, disruptions to transportation, and
damage to communication lines.'' \102\ The report found that
CISA does not manage or evaluate its Dams Sector activities,
does not coordinate or track its own Dams Sector activities,
does not gather or evaluate performance information on Dams
Sector activities, does not consistently coordinate and
effectively communicate with FEMA and other external Dams
Sector partners and stakeholders, and has not updated
overarching critical infrastructure plans.\103\ The agency
concurred with the five recommendations the report made to
improve CISA's oversight of the Dams Sector.\104\

Mr. DeFazio. The committee will come to order.
I ask unanimous consent that the chair be authorized to
declare a recess at any time during today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
As a reminder, please keep your microphone muted, unless
speaking. Should I hear any inadvertent background noise, I
will request the Member please mute their microphone.
To insert a document into the record, please email it to

[email protected]
.
I am going to abbreviate my opening statement. I will put
the full statement in the record, given the fact that you
probably can't hardly understand me, and I am having trouble.
This is the second hearing. The last hearing was industry
stakeholders, and we heard distressing and serious gaps,
shortages of cyber personnel, a lack of even the most basic
cyber hygiene practices, and a consensus among our witnesses
that the Federal Government needed to help the private sector,
which owns and operates 85 percent of the Nation's critical
infrastructure, to defend itself from and respond to attacks.
The bill, H.R. 3684, will provide funding at the local,
State, and Federal level to enhance the Nation's cyber
resilience and response to cybersecurity incidents. It improves
the National Highway System and other public transportation
systems' cybersecurity preparedness capabilities, and it
empowers the newly established Office of the National Cyber
Director, the President's principal adviser on cybersecurity
policy and strategy, to identify cybersecurity incidents and
coordinate a Federal response. Those are noteworthy steps, but
there is more to do.
Today we will hear from the Federal agencies responsible
for transportation and other critical infrastructure, and their
efforts to help private industry.
We have, for the most part, relied upon a voluntary
approach to protecting assets, choosing not to mandate
standards for cybersecurity audits or exercises. In contrast,
in other areas where private sector assets have the potential
to cause significant harm, the Government has established very
robust requirements--that would be nuclear power, aviation,
drinking water, wastewater, and others--to make them safer and
more resilient.
But many of these industries relate to other critical
industries, the private sector, and voluntary cooperation
sometimes isn't enough. You have to spend a bunch of money on
cybersecurity.
The leeches on Wall Street are going to say, ``Hey, why are
you spending all that money on cybersecurity? It is driving
down your stock price. We want to see you just, you know, put
the money in the bank.'' So there needs to be a little nudging
here.
And then, of course, the cost of the incident far exceeds
the investment they should have and would have made to prevent
that incident, absent an absolutely catastrophic incident, but
more basic incidents or ransomware, and all these other things
that are rather routine.
So, I don't think that implementing basic cybersecurity
standards, reporting requirements, and cybersecurity awareness
training should be voluntary. It should be required. And public
safety and the Nation's security depend upon these steps.
In the wake of the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack, the
Transportation Security Administration mandated specific
cybersecurity protections for pipelines to defend against
ransomware and other attacks. Colonial had turned down a
comprehensive audit before the event, which might have helped
prevent the event. But it was voluntary, so they said no,
thanks, we don't want to know about our vulnerabilities.
Last week, TSA issued basic cybersecurity enhancements for
the aviation sector that will go into effect early next year,
and I understand TSA intends to issue a security directive for
passenger rail, high-risk freight rail, and the transit sector
as early as today or this week. So, this is an appropriate time
for this hearing.
Both the GAO and the Department of Transportation's Office
of Inspector General, who we will hear from today, have made
thousands of recommendations related to cybersecurity
weaknesses at Federal agencies. Many of these recommendations
remain unaddressed. Some of their more alarming findings find
DOT's failure to implement a cybersecurity risk management
strategy and weaknesses in FAA's approach to cybersecurity for
avionics systems in commercial aircraft.
Similarly, the DOT IG has uncovered a range of
cybersecurity deficiencies and deemed information security one
of the Department's top management challenges. The OIG has
found evidence of inconsistent software updates, lax
enforcement of Federal cybersecurity requirements, and IT
systems at DOT that are vulnerable to exploitation by hostile
actors.
I look forward to hearing from our expert witnesses today
on the best mitigation and potential solutions, so that we can
look forward.
With that I recognize the ranking member, who hopefully has
better control of his voice.
[Mr. DeFazio's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Peter A. DeFazio, a Representative in
Congress from the State of Oregon, and Chair, Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure
Last month, we heard from industry stakeholders and cybersecurity
experts on the challenges they face in protecting our nation's
transportation systems and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks.
The testimony was troubling. Witnesses discussed serious gaps such as
shortages of cybersecurity personnel and a lack of basic cyber hygiene
practices. Notably, there was a consensus among our witnesses that
more--not less--federal action is needed to help the private sector,
which owns and operates an estimated 85 percent of the nation's
critical infrastructure, defend itself from, respond to, and recover
from cyberattacks.
Since our November hearing, Congress passed with bipartisan support
and the president signed H.R. 3684, the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act. Along with other vital investments in our nation's
infrastructure, this bill takes significant steps toward improving the
cybersecurity of our nation's critical infrastructure. It provides
funding at the local, state, and federal level to enhance the nation's
cyber resilience and response to cybersecurity incidents, it improves
the national highway system and other public transportation systems'
cybersecurity preparedness capabilities, and it empowers the newly
established Office of the National Cyber Director, the president's
principal advisor on cybersecurity policy and strategy, to identify
cybersecurity incidents and coordinate a federal response. These steps
are noteworthy, but there is much more to do.
Today, we will hear from the federal agencies who are responsible
for transportation systems and other critical infrastructure sectors
about their efforts to help private industry address these
cybersecurity gaps, as well as the challenges these agencies face
themselves in protecting the government's own networks from
cyberattacks.
In the cybersecurity realm, the federal government has largely
permitted the private sector to take a ``voluntary'' approach to
protecting their assets, choosing not to mandate cybersecurity
standards, cyber audits, or cybersecurity exercises. In contrast, in
other areas where private sector assets have the potential to cause
significant harm, the government has established requirements to
protect the public.
For example, nuclear power plants are subject to strict federal
mandates on their operation. Commercial airlines must comply with
federal reporting requirements regarding runway incursions and other
safety-related mishaps. Drinking water utilities must report to the
federal government if they detect spikes in lead or other dangerous
chemicals that can harm the public. These requirements have not
undermined these industries. In fact, they have made them stronger,
safer, and more resilient.
Yet, when it comes to intrusions into the networks of a critical
infrastructure entity, an intrusion that could damage critical
components of an airplane, a train, an oil or gas pipeline, or a port
facility, if that network belongs to a private company, up until now,
the federal government has merely asked for ``voluntary'' cooperation.
As we learned at our last hearing, an astounding 30 percent of public
transit agencies failed to report known breaches to anyone. I expect
the statistics in the private sector are far worse. In addition, the
short-term financial implications of making a cyber breach public,
possibly affecting a company's economic bottom line or shrinking a
CEO's bonus, inhibits cybersecurity transparency, masking known
vulnerabilities that should be quickly corrected.
Implementing basic cybersecurity standards, reporting requirements,
and cybersecurity awareness training should not be voluntary--they
should be required. The public's safety and the nation's security
depend on these systems. While no single change can prevent every
cyberattack, we need to raise the bar significantly and make
cyberattacks on our systems much more difficult to accomplish.
The Biden administration has taken notable steps to address these
issues holistically. They have issued orders and memoranda to encourage
infrastructure owners and operators to increase their cybersecurity
investments to minimize threats to all critical infrastructure sectors.
In the wake of the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack, the Transportation
Security Administration mandated specific cybersecurity protections for
pipelines to defend against ransomware and other attacks, along with
contingency and recovery plans. Last week, TSA issued basic
cybersecurity enhancements for the aviation sector that will go into
effect early next year and I understand TSA intends to issue a security
directive for passenger rail, high-risk freight rail, and the transit
sector as early as today. So, we appear to have scheduled this hearing
quite well. In addition, last month, the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency issued a binding directive that ordered
federal agencies to fix known software and hardware vulnerabilities in
their computer networks within six months. For those that care about
the public's safety and the nation's economic and national security,
these efforts--in both the public and private sectors--should not be
controversial. They should be welcomed and supported.
Both the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Department
of Transportation's Office of Inspector General (DOT OIG)--whom we will
hear from today--have made thousands--literally thousands--of
recommendations related to cybersecurity weaknesses at federal
agencies. Many of these recommendations remain unaddressed.
Some of GAO's more alarming findings include DOT's failure to
implement a cybersecurity risk management strategy and weaknesses in
FAA's approach to cybersecurity for avionics systems in commercial
aircraft.
Similarly, the DOT OIG has uncovered a range of cybersecurity
deficiencies and deemed information security one of the department's
top management challenges. The OIG has found, among other things,
evidence of inconsistent software updates, lax enforcement of federal
cybersecurity requirements, and IT systems at DOT that are vulnerable
to exploitation by hostile actors.
I look forward to hearing from our government witnesses today. I
expect them to explain the steps they are taking to address the
cybersecurity issues that have plagued them for far too long and update
us on the status of their efforts to work with private industry to
address the cybersecurity threats that endanger us all. As our
transportation systems and critical infrastructure assets--both public
and private--evolve, we become more efficient and connected than ever,
but we also create new opportunities for cyber villains. To improve our
resiliency to these threats, we must work together and address them in
a holistic manner.
With that, I recognize Ranking Member Graves for his opening
statement.

Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Before I give my statement, I do want to acknowledge your
announcement that you are not going to be seeking reelection
next term, and I want to commend you for your long and
distinguished career, serving over three decades in the House
of Representatives. I think that says a lot.
I have no doubt that you are going to finish out your term,
and you are going to work just as hard as ever on behalf of
your district and your constituents.
And I also believe that you and I agree that the Committee
on Transportation and Infrastructure is one of the best and
most important committees in Congress. And I know you will
continue to work diligently to address the vital issues before
this committee in the coming months.
I do wish you and your family all the best in your
retirement.
Turning to today's hearing, we will continue an examination
on cybersecurity challenges for the transportation and
infrastructure sectors.
During our first hearing on this topic in November, we
heard from the perspective of owners and operators of these
critical assets about the steps that they have taken to improve
their cybersecurity posture, the threats and risks that they
still face, and the effectiveness of the Federal Government's
cyber activities.
Now we will hear testimony from some of those Federal
agencies themselves and learn how they are providing support to
transportation and infrastructure operators in boosting their
cybersecurity preparedness and response capabilities.
Stakeholders have expressed concerns about aspects of those
Federal programs--for instance, the recent security directives
from the TSA--and I hope we can get some answers on how to
improve their implementation.
We also will hear today about how Federal agencies are
protecting their own systems, their own data, and
infrastructure from ever-changing cyber threats. I look forward
to hearing from our witness panel about the cyber challenges
that they have identified and examined for the Federal agencies
under the committee's jurisdiction, as well as receive updates
from those agencies on how they are rising to meet these
challenges.
And I appreciate our witnesses joining us today and
discussing how operators and Federal agencies can work
collaboratively to improve the cybersecurity of our Nation's
most critical transportation systems and infrastructure.
So, with that, I would yield back, and I look forward to
it.
[Mr. Graves of Missouri's prepared statement follows:]

OFFICE

Mr. Schachter. Good morning, Chair DeFazio, Ranking Member
Graves, and members of the committee. Thank you for the
opportunity to testify before you today, and for your support
of the Department of Transportation.
I am Cordell Schachter, Chief Information Officer. I am
honored to be here with FAA Chief Information Security Officer
Larry Grossman, U.S. DOT Office of Inspector General Assistant
Inspector General for IT Audits Kevin Dorsey, and officials
from the U.S. Coast Guard, the Transportation Security
Administration, and the Government Accountability Office.
I was appointed U.S. DOT's chief information officer on
August 30th of this year. My testimony today is based on my
observations and review of DOT records during my 3 months in
this position. My testimony is also informed by my 26 years of
service as a local government official in New York City, 13
years of that service as chief technology officer and CIO of
New York City's department of transportation.
In between two tours of New York City government service, I
worked 9 years for several multinational technology companies.
I have also taught master's level courses in civic technology
at New York University in New York City, and at St. Peter's
University in Jersey City, New Jersey.
I believe U.S. DOT's cybersecurity program has improved the
Department's information security posture, and we are on a path
for continual improvement, according to Government best
practices. U.S. DOT's executive ranks have many positions
filled by professionals with the knowledge and the expertise of
providing service directly to the public. This begins with
Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Deputy Secretary Polly Trottenberg,
and the leaders of many of our operating administrations or
modes.
They have also held key elected and appointed leadership
positions in cities and States solving problems, protecting
citizens, and improving the quality of life of their
constituents.
We now have before us one of the greatest opportunities to
improve the quality of life for all Americans. We look forward
to partnering with Congress and our sister Federal agencies to
implement the landmark bipartisan infrastructure law.
On the same day that President Biden signed the law, he
executed an Executive order to ensure, among other priorities,
increased coordination across the public sector to implement it
effectively. We commit to that goal. Our executive leadership
teams' experience includes making improvements to systems while
they continue to operate. Similarly, we will continue to
improve our existing systems to make them more cyber secure
while they continue to operate, so that they resiliently
support DOT's operations and the American people.
I want to transparently acknowledge that we have multiple
open audit findings from previous OIG and GAO cybersecurity
audits. We respect and take seriously their assessments. I have
designated cybersecurity improvement as the top priority for
DOT's information technology organization, the Office of the
Chief Information Officer. We have begun a series of cyber
sprints to complete tasks and make plans to meet our Federal
cybersecurity requirements, and implement best practices,
including those from President Biden's Executive order for
improving the Nation's cybersecurity.
The cyber sprints prioritize three areas: system access
control; website security; and improved governance, oversight,
and coordination across DOT. These priority activities address
OIG and GAO findings.
DOT is actively working to meet its responsibilities to
securely improve the Department's information technology
infrastructure, while implementing our portions of the
bipartisan infrastructure law.
We will also meet the challenge of continuously improving
the cybersecurity of DOT information technology systems, while
keeping those systems available for use.
We look forward to working with this committee, our agency
partners, and the White House to strengthen and protect our
infrastructure and systems.
Thank you again for this opportunity to testify. I will be
happy to answer your questions.

Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Mr. Schachter, for doing it exactly
in 5 minutes. I appreciate that. We will now move on to Mr.
Larry Grossman.
Mr. Grossman?
Mr. Grossman. Good morning. From air traffic control, to
the largest airliner, or the lightest drone, connectivity is
the way of the future in aerospace. It is also why we have to
constantly raise the bar when it comes to cybersecurity.
Chair DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, members of the
committee, cyber threats are an ongoing concern, and our
increasing reliance on highly integrated and interdependent
computers and networks is cause for vigilance at all levels of
the aviation industry. This is especially true at FAA, where we
are responsible for operating the Nation's air traffic control
system, and overseeing design, manufacture, and testing of
aircraft and systems, including avionics, and also for me
personally, as a pilot, a flight instructor, and an aircraft
owner.
But I am here today to discuss the FAA's approach to
cybersecurity within our agency for those we regulate, and for
the aerospace community at large.
I want to start by noting the importance of this
administration's recent Executive order on improving the
Nation's cybersecurity, and I want to thank Congress for the
continuing guidance and direction over many years.
The FAA's efforts to address cyber challenges have
benefited from your oversight and the cooperative efforts with
other executive branch agencies.
We appreciate all input as we continually strive to make
our airspace system safer and more efficient. You have heard
Administrator Dickson say it before, and I will repeat it here
again: Safety is a journey, not a destination.
The same is true of cybersecurity. What we do today will
not be good enough for tomorrow or the day after. We are always
striving to improve. We are constantly updating and evolving
FAA cybersecurity strategy we put into action through the
cross-agency Cybersecurity Steering Committee. The strategy
includes protecting and defending FAA networks and systems,
enhancing our risk management capabilities, building and
maintaining workforce capabilities, and engaging with external
partners.
We defend our air traffic control and other networks by
using separate and distinct security perimeters and controls
that are the responsibility of the FAA chief information
security officer and FAA chief information officer.
To assess cyber threats and vulnerabilities to our
networks, we have developed the cyber test facility at our
William J. Hughes Technical Center, where we also conduct
testing and evaluation. We ensure cyber resilience in connected
aircraft through risk assessments during initial certification
process, or any time there is a change to a previous design
certification. When existing regulations will not provide
adequate protection, we issue special conditions.
Throughout an aircraft's life, operators must track
cybersecurity issues in much the same way that they do for all
other issues, using data-driven methodologies. That allows
operators in the FAA to make informed risk management
decisions. Smart decisions require a talented and dedicated
cyber workforce, and we continue to invest in our people.
Congress recognized the importance of this effort, and in
2018 asked the FAA to enter into an agreement with the National
Academy of Sciences to conduct the cybersecurity workforce
study. The results of that study, which we received in June,
made it clear that there is more work to do, although I will
say that many of the recommendations are consistent with FAA
cybersecurity strategic objectives, and many others align with
broader, ongoing FAA workforce development and recruitment
efforts.
And finally, one of the major components of our strategy is
to build and maintain relationships and trust with our external
partners. This is critical for defending and reacting and
recovering from a cyberattack. It is why we are a lead agency
on the Aviation Cyber Initiative interagency task force with
DHS and DoD. It is why we work collectively to identify and
address cybersecurity risks in the aviation ecosystem. The
ecosystem includes stakeholders ranging from airport
authorities to manufacturers.
As technology of the aviation ecosystem evolves, we expect
that cybersecurity will continue to be a growing challenge and
a significant component of aviation safety and aerospace
efficiency. We are prepared for this challenge and look forward
to keeping Congress and this committee informed on our
progress.
I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have.
[Mr. Grossman's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Larry Grossman, Chief Information Security
Officer, Federal Aviation Administration
Good morning Chair DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and Members of
the Committee:
Thank you for the opportunity to be here with you today to discuss
the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) approach to cybersecurity,
both in terms of how the FAA addresses cybersecurity matters internally
and how the FAA interacts with the aviation community on cybersecurity
matters.
The core and continuing mission of the FAA is to provide the safest
and most efficient aerospace system in the world. Technology has
contributed greatly to the safety and efficiency of the national
airspace system (NAS). It has also resulted in highly integrated and
increasingly interdependent computers and networks supporting the
aviation community. Cyber-based threats have made the integration of
cybersecurity protections into all aspects of the FAA's mission
increasingly important. This Administration has recognized the growing
importance of cybersecurity. President Biden's Executive Order 14028,
``Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity'', is a sweeping directive that
addresses cyber threat information sharing, cybersecurity
modernization, software supply chain security, identifying and
remediating cyber vulnerabilities, and incident response.\1\ This
executive order will drive many elements of FAA's strategic cyber
initiatives across both the agency's IT infrastructure as well as the
infrastructure of the NAS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

10460/improving-the-nations-cybersecurity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAA's Cybersecurity Structure and Strategy
To achieve its mission, the FAA is dependent on information
systems, and operates these systems in three separate domains: the NAS
Domain, operated by FAA's Air Traffic Organization (ATO), the Mission
Support Domain, operated by FAA's Office of Finance and Management
(AFN), and the Research and Development Domain, operated by FAA's
Office of NextGen (ANG). Each of the three domains represents a
separate security perimeter with a distinct set of security controls.
While each FAA Domain operator is responsible for the cybersecurity of
its infrastructure, the FAA Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
and the Chief Information Officer have overall responsibility for the
FAA's cybersecurity and ensuring that Domain operators comply with
applicable agency, departmental, and federal requirements.
Overall, the FAA manages all aspects of the agency's cybersecurity
mission through the Cybersecurity Steering Committee (CSC). The CSC was
established in 2014 after the agency recognized the need to work more
holistically at cybersecurity across the FAA enterprise. The CSC is
charged with developing the FAA's cybersecurity strategy, setting
priorities, and operational guidelines in support of an integrated
agency-wide approach to protecting the FAA from cyber-threats. The FAA
Cybersecurity Strategy was first developed in 2015 and sets clear goals
and objectives for the FAA's cybersecurity program. These
responsibilities are all accomplished through the collaboration of AFN,
ATO, ANG, the Office of Aviation Safety (AVS), the Office of Airports,
the Office of Security & Hazardous Materials Safety, and the Department
of Transportation (DOT) CISO as members of the FAA CSC. With the input
of these groups, other FAA offices as needed, and oversight of the CSC
by senior FAA officials, the FAA continues to review, update, and
maintain the framework to support a more cyber-secure and resilient
aviation ecosystem.
Following the establishment of the CSC, Congress continued to
recognize the growing significance of cyber-threats. In 2016, Congress
directed the FAA to develop a comprehensive strategic framework to
reduce cybersecurity risks to the NAS, civil aviation, and agency
information systems. Congress also directed the FAA to establish a
cybersecurity research and development plan for the NAS, clarify
cybersecurity roles and responsibilities of FAA offices and employees,
identify and implement actions to reduce cybersecurity risks to air
traffic control systems, and assess the cost and timeline of developing
and maintaining an agency-wide cybersecurity threat model.\2\ In
response to the mandate, the FAA expanded its Cybersecurity Strategy
and it is updated annually. The Cybersecurity Strategy discusses in
detail the FAA's five goals which are: 1) refine and maintain a
cybersecurity governance structure to enhance cross-domain synergy; 2)
protect and defend FAA networks and systems to mitigate risks to FAA
missions and service delivery; 3) enhance data-driven risk management
decision capabilities; 4) build and maintain workforce capabilities for
cybersecurity; and 5) build and maintain relationships with, and
provide guidance to, external partners in government and industry to
sustain and improve cybersecurity in the aviation ecosystem.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Pub. Law No. 114-190, Sec.  2111.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2018, Congress directed the FAA to assess the Cybersecurity
Strategy for risks, review its objectives, and assess the FAA's level
of engagement with stakeholders in carrying out the Strategy.\3\
Although the FAA found the Cybersecurity Strategy's framework to be
fundamentally sound, modifications were made to align it with other
executive branch cyber initiatives, such as the National Cybersecurity
Strategy and the National Strategy for Aviation Security. Enhancements
were made to address the growing use of cloud and ``as-a-service''
technologies. The Cybersecurity Strategy was also modified to reflect
efforts to improve response times in mitigation of internet-facing
vulnerabilities, as well as cyber hygiene principles. It was
strengthened by including a focus on external stakeholder engagement
activities, including information-sharing and best practices around
aviation cybersecurity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ Pub. Law No. 115-254, Sec.  509.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further, in response to a March 2019 DOT Office of Inspector
General audit of FAA's Cybersecurity Strategy, the FAA finalized the
application of its cyber risk model to support its air traffic mission
and related systems, and established priorities for research and
development activities on cybersecurity. These efforts have improved
the FAA's ability to maintain up-to-date capabilities necessary for
identifying and addressing rapidly evolving cyber threats.
FAA's Cybersecurity Role in the Aviation Ecosystem
When discussing cybersecurity as it relates to aviation, the FAA
frequently refers to the ``aviation ecosystem.'' Aspects of the
aviation ecosystem include aircraft, air carriers, airports, air
traffic operations, maintenance facilities and the personnel that carry
out the functions for each. Although there is some overlap of cyber
responsibilities with other participants for certain parts of the
ecosystem, the FAA has safety oversight responsibilities for aircraft
design, manufacturing and testing of aeronautical products, production,
the continuous operational safety of certified products, and the
certification of airmen and maintenance personnel. This includes
components installed in aircraft, such as avionics. These
responsibilities require the FAA to routinely engage with other
aviation cybersecurity stakeholders including the private sector and
other executive branch agencies that may have cyber responsibilities in
the aviation ecosystem.
With respect to FAA's safety oversight responsibility in
certificating aircraft, modern airplanes are designed and equipped with
safety-enhancing systems that enable improved communications and
navigation information. These systems rely on connectivity between an
airplane and ground or space-based infrastructure. The reliance upon
such connectivity creates cyber risks and, since such risks could
affect the airworthiness of the aircraft, requires that such risks be
addressed during the certification process. As part of the FAA's
certification practices for standard category aircraft, cybersecurity
risk assessments are conducted by the applicant when they apply for
design certification or a change to a previously certified product. The
FAA relies upon its broad safety regulatory authority to ensure that
cyber risks are managed through the application of applicant-specific
``special conditions'' that require critical aircraft systems to be
protected from adverse intentional unauthorized electronic
interference. The FAA issues special conditions, which are rules of
particular applicability, when the current airworthiness regulations do
not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for a novel or
unusual design feature. The FAA addresses cybersecurity safety issues
in much the same way as all safety issues, by monitoring safety impacts
using a data-driven methodology. In response to an October 2020
Government Accountability Office report, the FAA conducted an initial
cybersecurity risk assessment of avionic systems.\4\ The FAA intends to
do an in-depth analysis of our oversight responsibilities with respect
to current and evolving avionics. At the request of the FAA, the
Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee made 30 recommendations on
Aircraft Systems Information Security and Protection. To date, the FAA
has updated policy, standards and industry guidance for certifying
critical aircraft systems.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-86.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The FAA also has a direct operational role in the air traffic
aspect of the aviation ecosystem and manages cyber threats to the NAS
Domain through ATO. The NAS Domain consists of over a hundred systems
and an ever-growing networking infrastructure. The networking
infrastructure is dedicated to NAS Domain operations and segregated
from non-NAS infrastructures via secure monitored gateways. The NAS
Domain provides five major FAA mission-critical services that directly
support air traffic control: automation, communications, navigation,
surveillance, and weather. ATO is responsible for air navigation
services in all U.S.-controlled airspace and performs maintenance
services for all NAS Domain systems. ATO is responsible for NAS Domain
operational cybersecurity and provides the identification, protection,
detection, response, and recovery capabilities to ensure continued NAS
Domain operations under a range of cyber conditions. Further, in
support of its cyber responsibilities for the NAS, in 2015, the FAA
established the Cyber Test Facility, or CyTF, to assess cyber threats
and vulnerabilities and conduct cyber testing and evaluation.
FAA's Coordination with Other Stakeholders in the Aviation Ecosystem
One of the major components of the FAA's Cybersecurity Strategy is
focused on the FAA's continual effort to build and maintain
relationships with, and provide guidance to, external partners in
government and industry to sustain and improve cybersecurity in the
aviation ecosystem. Building trust between the FAA and aviation
cybersecurity stakeholders is critical to the success of building an
aviation cybersecurity framework that enhances defense, reaction, and
recovery from a cyber-incident and improves resilience. An example of
the FAA's efforts in this area is the establishment of the Aviation
Cyber Initiative (ACI) interagency task force. In May 2019 the
Secretaries of Transportation, Homeland Security, and Defense chartered
ACI as a forum for coordination and collaboration among federal
agencies on a wide range of activities aimed at cyber risk reduction
within the aviation ecosystem. Such activities include research,
development, testing, evaluation initiatives relating to aviation
cybersecurity, engaging with stakeholders on activities for reducing
cyber risks, and seeking potential improvement opportunities and risk
mitigation strategies. The task force is tri-chaired by the three
Departments, with the FAA representing the DOT on the task force. Some
of the key areas for ACI working groups involve efforts to increase
information sharing among ecosystem stakeholders--including airports
and airlines, participation in inter-agency cyber exercises, and the
development of risk mitigation strategies and guidance to improve and
standardize risk management across the aviation ecosystem.
FAA's outreach, collaboration, and coordination with other
stakeholders in the aviation ecosystem is not limited to its
participation in ACI, and the FAA will continue to support information
sharing efforts within the aviation industry to develop information
security standards and best practices consistent with the National
Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. This
engagement recognizes the increasingly interconnected nature of
aviation information systems from the flight deck to air traffic
control and air carrier operations, which necessitate innovative and
collaborative solutions to secure them. Additionally, one-on-one
engagements with industry groups and standards bodies are essential to
ensure comprehensive cybersecurity policy and guidance for
manufacturers and operators of aircraft. Further, the FAA will continue
to actively engage with stakeholders around the globe to raise
awareness of cybersecurity issues relevant to the aviation ecosystem
and support initiatives to address cyber threats and vulnerabilities in
a coordinated and collaborative manner.
FAA's Cybersecurity Workforce
One of the overarching goals of the FAA's Cybersecurity Strategy is
to continue building and maintaining the agency's workforce
capabilities for cybersecurity. Congress also recognized the importance
of this effort and in 2018 directed the FAA to enter into an agreement
with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on the FAA
cybersecurity workforce in order to develop recommendations to increase
its size, quality, and diversity.\5\ In June 2021, the FAA received the
results of the Cyber Workforce Study, conducted by the National Academy
of Sciences. The study identified key challenges facing the FAA's cyber
workforce, it noted opportunities for strengthening that workforce, and
made recommendations to help the FAA capitalize on those opportunities
and address the challenges. For example, the study emphasized the
importance of the FAA's ability to anticipate the need to continually
retool the cybersecurity skills of its workforce given the rapidly
changing nature of the challenge. It noted that the FAA cannot assume
that today's cyber knowledge and skills will be sufficient to meet the
needs of the future. The FAA recognizes that leveraging training and
reskilling for the workforce will be a powerful tool for the FAA to
grow and maintain the cyber skills needed now and in the future. The
FAA also embraces the value of workforce training through participation
in exercises. For example, the FAA regularly exercises its incident
response plan to ensure familiarity with communications and escalation
procedures. These internal exercises provide valuable experience for
staff and increase the level of preparedness to respond to a cyber-
incident. The FAA will continue to examine where expanding internal
exercises will benefit preparedness.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, many of the recommendations in the National Academy of
Science study are consistent with the FAA's cybersecurity strategic
objectives, and many others align with broader ongoing FAA workforce
development, diversity, and recruitment efforts. As technology and
systems continue to evolve to meet the aviation challenges of tomorrow,
so must our workforce. The FAA recognizes that a diverse pool of talent
is critical to finding the right people for the right job at the right
time. We also recognize that competitiveness in cybersecurity hiring
and retention is important in order to attract and retain top talent.
The FAA will use all of its federal recruiting, hiring and retention
capabilities to continue building and to maintain the FAA cybersecurity
workforce.
Conclusion
Chair DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and Members of the Committee,
the FAA's cybersecurity responsibilities and our strategy to implement
those responsibilities has expanded and evolved significantly over the
years. Our efforts to address cybersecurity challenges have benefited
from congressional oversight, our own initiatives, and our cooperative
efforts with other executive branch agencies. As the technology of the
aviation ecosystem evolves, we expect that cybersecurity will continue
to be a growing challenge and a significant aspect of both aviation
safety and the efficient use of airspace. We look forward to keeping
Congress informed of our progress on all aspects of cybersecurity. I
would be happy to answer any questions you may have.

Mr. DeFazio. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Grossman.
Now, Ms. Victoria Newhouse, you are recognized for 5
minutes.
Ms. Newhouse. Good morning, Chairman DeFazio, Ranking
Member Graves, and distinguished members of this committee. My
name is Victoria Newhouse, and I serve as the Deputy Assistant
Administrator for Policy, Plans, and Engagement at the
Transportation Security Administration. I greatly appreciate
the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss TSA's
important role in cybersecurity for our Nation's
infrastructure.
As you know, TSA was established by the Aviation and
Transportation Security Act, which was signed into law on
November 19th, 2001. Under that law, TSA assumed the mission to
oversee transportation security in all modes of transportation,
be that aviation, or the Nation's surface transportation
system, mass transit and passenger rail, freight rail, highway
and motor carrier, pipeline, as well as supporting maritime
security with our United States Coast Guard partners.
As we recently observed TSA's 20th anniversary, we
rededicated ourselves to our critical mission to protect our
Nation's transportation systems.
My personal commitment to TSA's important mission to
ferociously protect our homeland is fueled by my own personal
experience on September 11, 2001, surviving the attack on the
Pentagon on that fateful day, when we all lost over 2,977
friends, family members, and colleagues.
This is not a mission we can accomplish alone. Our success
is highly dependent on close collaboration and strong
relationships with our transportation industry stakeholders and
our Federal agency partners, including several who are on this
esteemed panel today.
Cybersecurity incidents affecting transportation are a
growing, evolving, and persistent threat. Across the U.S.
critical infrastructure, cyber threat actors have demonstrated
their willingness and ability to conduct malicious cyber
activities targeting critical infrastructure by exploiting the
vulnerability of operational technology and information
technology systems. Malicious cyber actors continue to target
U.S. critical infrastructure through transportation systems.
For instance, as mentioned earlier, the ransomware incident
against the Colonial Pipeline last May underscores this threat.
TSA is highly dedicated to protecting our transportation
networks against these evolving threats, and we continue to
work collaboratively with public and private stakeholders to
drive the implementation of intelligence-driven, risk-based
policies and programs, and continue our robust information-
sharing efforts.
As reflected in the cybersecurity infrastructure testimony
provided by our industry colleagues on November 4th of this
year, we have a vital national interest in understanding,
mitigating, and protecting its people and infrastructure from
cybersecurity threats. Constantly evolving potential for
malicious cyber activity against the transportation
infrastructure points to the need for continued vigilance,
information sharing, and development of dynamic policies and
capabilities to strengthen our cybersecurity posture. TSA has
fought to mitigate the degradation, destruction, or malfunction
of systems that control this infrastructure by implementing
immediate security requirements through security policies.
After the Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident in May,
there was a clear understanding that we need to take more
actions to prevent another pipeline incident in the future. In
that vein, TSA issued two security directives to immediately
address these threats. We required the pipeline operators who
operate and transport over 85 percent of the Nation's energy
and assets to take immediate actions to report cybersecurity
incidents to my partner agency, Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency; designate an express
cybersecurity coordinator that is available 24/7; and implement
specific mitigation measures.
We continue our work across all of our modes, as credible
cyber threat information is driving our most recent efforts to
issue more directives in this vein. As Chairman DeFazio
mentioned earlier, we are working with our rail, higher risk
freight rail, passenger rail, and rail transit operators, and
aviation in four critical actions: designate a cybersecurity
coordinator; reporting incidents to CISA; developing an
incident response plan; and conducting self-assessments to
address potential vulnerabilities and gaps.
Chairman DeFazio, we continue our robust engagement with
our partners through our Surface Transportation Security
Advisory Committee and our Aviation Security Advisory
Committee, along with numerous corporate executives, all the
way down to the security level.
Chairman DeFazio, on behalf of all of my colleagues at TSA,
we would like to congratulate you on your decades of service,
and thank you for your service to all of us in our Nation.
I look forward to taking any questions you may have. Thank
you.

Prepared Statement of Victoria Newhouse, Deputy Assistant Administrator
for Policy, Plans, and Engagement, Transportation Security
Administration, U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Good morning, Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and
distinguished Members of the Committee. My name is Victoria Newhouse
and I serve as the Deputy Assistant Administrator for Policy, Plans,
and Engagement within the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).
I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss
TSA's role in cybersecurity for our Nation's infrastructure.
TSA was established by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act
(ATSA), which was signed into law on November 19, 2001. With the
enactment of ATSA, TSA assumed the mission to oversee security in all
modes of transportation, be that aviation or the Nation's surface
transportation systems--mass transit and passenger rail, freight rail,
highway and motor carrier, pipeline, as well as supporting maritime
security with our U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) partners. As we recently
observed TSA's 20th anniversary, we rededicated ourselves to our
critical mission to protect our Nation's transportation systems as they
remain attractive targets for our adversaries to directly attack our
Homeland, our commercial markets, and ultimately the freedoms we hold
so dear. My personal commitment to TSA's important mission to
ferociously protect our Homeland is fueled by my own experience on
September 11, 2001, surviving the attack on the Pentagon on that
fateful day when we lost 2,977 friends, family members and colleagues.
This is not a mission we can accomplish alone. TSA's mission success is
highly dependent on close collaboration and strong relationships with
our transportation industry stakeholders and our Federal agency
partners, including several who are present on this esteemed panel
today. TSA's motto--``not on my watch''--truly reflects our collective
approach to secure our Homeland against all threats, including
cybersecurity threats.
Transportation Cybersecurity Threats
Cybersecurity incidents affecting transportation are a growing,
evolving, and persistent threat. Across U.S. critical infrastructure,
cyber threat actors have demonstrated their willingness and ability to
conduct malicious cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure by
exploiting the vulnerability of Internet-accessible Operational
Technology (OT) assets and Information Technology (IT) systems.
Malicious cyber actors continue to target U.S. critical infrastructure,
to include transportation systems, through malicious cyber activity and
cyber espionage campaigns. For instance, the ransomware incident
against Colonial Pipeline last May underscores this threat. The United
States' adversaries and strategic competitors will continue to use
cyber espionage and malicious cyber activity to seek economic,
political and military advantage over the United States and its allies
and partners. TSA is dedicated to protecting our Nation's
transportation networks against evolving threats and continues to work
collaboratively with public and private stakeholders to expand the
implementation of intelligence-driven, risk-based policies and programs
and continue robust information sharing to reinforce the security
posture of these networks.
Addressing Cybersecurity Threats
As reflected in cybersecurity and infrastructure testimony provided
by industry colleagues to this committee on November 4, 2021, the
United States has a vital national interest in understanding,
mitigating, and protecting its people and infrastructure from
cybersecurity threats in the transportation domain. The constantly
evolving potential for malicious cyber activity against the
transportation infrastructure point to the need for continued
vigilance, information sharing, and development of dynamic policies and
capabilities to strengthen our cybersecurity posture. Consistent with
the President's National Security Memorandum on Improving Cybersecurity
for Critical Infrastructure Control Systems (July 28, 2021), Department
of Homeland Security priorities, and our broader statutory authorities,
TSA has sought to mitigate the ``degradation, destruction, or
malfunction of systems that control this infrastructure'' by
implementing immediate security requirements through security policies.
After the Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident in May, there was a
clear understanding across the Administration, Congress, industry, and
the public for the need to take action to prevent another pipeline
incident in the future. The TSA Administrator leveraged authority under
49 U.S.C. Sec. 114 to respond to emerging threats by directing select
owners and operators of pipeline and natural gas facilities to
implement necessary cyber protections. TSA issued two Security
Directives (SDs), effective May 28, 2021, and July 26, 2021, to
immediately address these threats. Among several requirements, the SDs
required pipeline companies to report cybersecurity incidents to the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), designate a
cybersecurity coordinator to be available 24/7, and implement specific
mitigation measures to protect against ransomware incidents.
Credible cyber threat information also supported our recent efforts
to implement similar security measures across the domestic surface and
aviation transportation networks. In the surface domain, new
cybersecurity protocols require higher risk freight railroads,
passenger rail and rail transit operators to take four critical
actions:
1.  Designate a cybersecurity coordinator;
2.  Report cybersecurity incidents to CISA;
3.  Develop a cybersecurity incident response plan to reduce the
risk of an operational disruption; and
4.  Conduct a cybersecurity self-assessment to identify potential
gaps or vulnerabilities in their systems.

In addition to these requirements, TSA also issued an Information
Circular to lower risk surface transportation operators, including
over-the-road buses and lower risk rail operators, strongly
recommending they immediately implement these same measures.
Within the aviation subsector, TSA recently updated established
security programs with these same measures, starting with designating a
cybersecurity coordinator and reporting specific cybersecurity
incidents to CISA. In a second set of security program updates to be
issued in the near future, TSA will also implement the requirements to
conduct cybersecurity self-assessments and develop cybersecurity
incident response plans.
DHS and TSA engaged with stakeholders throughout the development
process for these measures to ensure awareness of the threat picture,
review draft proposals, and obtain industry feedback. This included
stakeholder CEO-level discussions with DHS and TSA leaders, threat
briefings for aviation, pipeline, and other surface transportation
stakeholders, multiple policy reviews by industry and government
stakeholders, and consistent engagement sessions with transportation
associations and regulated entities for awareness on the proposed
strategies. For example, we engaged TSA's Surface Transportation
Security Advisory Committee (STSAC) on several occasions to share and
discuss these new security requirements and held numerous stakeholder
calls and engagements with the specific covered operators prior to
issuing these most recent security requirements. In addition, airport
and airline stakeholders also provided extensive input to our aviation
cyber requirements to ensure they can operationalize them effectively
and efficiently. Our interagency partners also participated extensively
to ensure unity of effort across DHS and the interagency. We
incorporated stakeholder inputs resulting in revisions to these
cybersecurity policy requirements, including adjustments to incident
reporting and response plan timeframes, defining reportable
cybersecurity incidents, and using established methods to conduct self-
assessments. We continue working closely with stakeholders to assist
with implementation and respond to any questions regarding these
requirements with an eye on continually improving our collective
efforts to secure the Nation's transportation systems from cyber
threats.
Information Sharing and Engagement
Our work does not simply end after issuing these cybersecurity
requirements. On the contrary, the TSA enterprise continues our robust
stakeholder engagement to mitigate cyber threats. We work closely with
these covered operators to successfully implement these requirements,
educate our vast network of transportation operators, and continue to
seek input from both the STSAC and the Aviation Security Advisory
Committee (ASAC) on how to best integrate cybersecurity into the fabric
of our transportation security mission. For example, we have sought,
incorporated, and continue to seek stakeholder input, including from
those advisory committees, on TSA's Cybersecurity Roadmap. TSA conducts
robust outreach with thousands of individual transportation operators
to implement these requirements and ensure consistent application
across the transportation sector. We continually seek opportunities to
expand information exchanges and to provide evaluation tools and
training programs to evaluate systems, identify vulnerabilities, and
incorporate security measures and best practices that mitigate cyber
threats. This includes efforts such as the Baseline Assessment for
Security Enhancement (BASE) program and the Intermodal Security
Training and Exercise Program (I-STEP). TSA actively supports broader
DHS efforts, such as the 60-day Transportation Cybersecurity Sprint in
September and October that focused on enhancing cyber risk management
and cybersecurity in the context of the transportation sector with
particular emphasis on TSA, CISA, and USCG engagements.
On behalf of DHS, TSA and USCG are the Co-Sector Risk Management
Agency for the Transportation Security Sector (TSS) along with the
Department of Transportation (DOT). In that role, TSA serves as the
executive agent with the USCG for developing, deploying, and promoting
TSS-focused cybersecurity initiatives, programs, assessment tools,
strategies, and threat and intelligence information-sharing products.
TSA is in close alignment with CISA and coordinates on both a tactical
and strategic level to raise the cybersecurity baseline across the
transportation sector.
TSA also supports DHS's cybersecurity efforts in alignment with the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity
Framework (Framework). The Framework is designed to provide a
foundation for industry to better manage and mitigate their cyber risk.
TSA shares information and resources and develops products for
stakeholders to support their adoption of the Framework. For example,
TSA in conjunction with the USCG and the DOT, has been working with
NIST to develop transportation-specific profiles for the Framework
through a series of sector surveys to allow for further targeted sector
adoption of the Framework.
Robust information and intelligence sharing is a key enabler of
TSA's mission to protect the nation's transportation systems to ensure
the freedom of movement for people and commerce. TSA coordinates with
the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis and Intelligence Community
(IC) partners across the federal government to share cyber threat
information with industry as soon as it becomes available. To enhance
mission performance, TSA also facilitates both classified and
unclassified briefings for industry representatives to ensure that the
evolving threat picture is communicated to trade associations, industry
executive leadership, and key industry security personnel. TSA's
commitment to information sharing is strongly supported by two full-
time threat intelligence sharing cells--the Aviation Domain
Intelligence Integration & Analysis Cell (ADIAC) and the Surface
Information Sharing Cell (SISC). Through these information sharing
entities, TSA shares thousands of threat items, including cyber threat
information. Additionally, we issue various cyber assessments and
analytic products, including Cybersecurity Awareness Messages to
operators and other products in conjunction with our sister component
CISA and Federal law enforcement, to ensure widest distribution across
the transportation sector. These two information sharing cells are
excellent examples of government and industry partnership, and their
establishment resulted directly from stakeholder collaboration. For
instance, the SISC's establishment fulfills an important STSAC
recommendation, and we continue working to enhance the SISC's
capabilities.
Closing
Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and distinguished Members
of the Committee, thank you for this opportunity to share the steps and
measures TSA has taken in concert with our stakeholders to strengthen
transportation critical infrastructure to address the serious and
persistent cybersecurity threat. TSA is committed to ensuring
appropriate security measures are in place to increase the cyber and
physical security posture of our Nation's transportation systems. Thank
you for the chance to appear before you today. I look forward to
answering any questions you may have.

Mr. DeFazio. Thanks, Ms. Newhouse. I have quite a history
with TSA. John Mica chaired the Aviation Subcommittee, and I
was ranking, and it was under our jurisdiction then. We had no
Homeland Security Committee, and we stood it up in pretty short
order. And I can say it is still a work in progress. But, it is
so far ahead of where we were pre-9/11. And I would love to go
into that at some point and talk about it. But anyway, it is
not the subject of this hearing.
Rear Admiral John W. Mauger?
Admiral Mauger. Good morning, Chairman DeFazio, Ranking
Member Graves, and distinguished members of the committee. I am
honored to be here this morning to discuss cybersecurity in the
maritime transportation system, a top priority for the Coast
Guard.
Our national security and economic prosperity are
inextricably linked to a safe and efficient Marine
Transportation System, or MTS. The MTS is an integrated network
of 361 ports and 25,000 miles of waterways. Marine
transportation supports one-quarter of U.S. GDP, and provides
employment for one in seven working-age Americans. The MTS
enables our Armed Forces to project power around the globe, and
any substantial disruption to marine transportation can cause
cascading effects to our economy and to our national security.
Cyberattacks are a significant threat to the maritime critical
infrastructure. And while we must continue to work to prevent
attacks, we must also be clear-eyed that attacks will occur,
and we must ensure that the MTS is resilient.
Protecting maritime critical infrastructure and ensuring
resiliency is a shared responsibility. Thank you for holding
both sessions to allow industry and Government to describe
their efforts.
The Coast Guard is the Nation's lead Federal agency for
protecting the MTS. In August, the Commandant released a cyber
strategic outlook to guide our work ahead. At the core of the
Coast Guard strategy is the recognition that cybersecurity is
an operational imperative, both for our Service and for the
maritime industry. With support from Congress, we established
Coast Guard Cyber Command, and built an operational force to
execute missions and protect Coast Guard and DoD networks.
Coast Guard cyber forces are manned, trained, and equipped, in
accordance with joint DoD standards, but have a broad range of
authorities to address complex issues spanning national defense
and homeland security, including protecting the MTS.
The Coast Guard's approach to protecting the MTS leverages
our proven prevention and response framework. To prevent
incidents, we leverage our authorities in the Nation's ports to
set standards and conduct compliance. We refer to this as
``cyber risk management'' and require accountability
assessments, mitigation exercises, and incident reporting. To
prepare for and respond to cyber incidents, Coast Guard sectors
are leading field-level exercises with Area Maritime Security
Committees and have established unified commands with FBI and
CISA to lead the Federal response to cyberattacks in the ports.
Cyberattacks will increasingly have physical impacts beyond
computer networks. By incorporating cybersecurity into our
prevention and response framework, we provide a comprehensive,
all-hazards approach to this threat. But we cannot do this
alone. As the co-Sector Risk Management Agency for
transportation, we look to both CISA and TSA as key partners.
The MTS is dependent on other critical infrastructure. CISA
coordinates across sectors, shares threat and vulnerability
information, and provides cyber technical assistance. These
efforts build coherence within the interagency, foster
collaboration with the private sector, and enhance our ability
to protect the MTS. Our relationships with CISA and TSA are
strong, and will continue to mature.
Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility with the private
sector, as well. Collaboration with the industry is paramount
and focused on information sharing and good governance. At the
national level, we stood up a Maritime Cyber Readiness Branch
within Coast Guard Cyber Command as a focal point for maritime
threat monitoring, information sharing, and response
coordination. At the local level, we continue to strengthen
communications through engagement at our Area Maritime Security
Committees.
Risk-based regulations, which leverage international and
industry-recognized standards, are the foundation for good
governance. With congressional support, we established the
National Maritime Security Advisory Committee to facilitate
consultation with industry on standards development. We worked
with the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, to
address the risks posed by foreign vessels. We are committed to
a transparent approach, as we balance the urgency of cyber
threats with informed rulemaking.
The cyber threat is dynamic. As we continually evolve to
address emergent needs, we will need Congress' continued
support. We are grateful for the fiscal year 2021
appropriations. The investments in Coast Guard Cyber Command
provide additional capability for our Service, and serve a key
role in protecting the MTS. The establishment of 22 MTS cyber
advisors in the field are key nodes for coordination and
collaboration at our field units.
We look forward to the continued dialogue with Congress on
this important issue, and I appreciate the opportunity to
testify, and look forward to your questions.
[Admiral Mauger's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Rear Admiral John W. Mauger, Assistant Commandant
for Prevention Policy, U.S. Coast Guard
Introduction
Good morning Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and
distinguished Members of the Committee. I am honored to be here to
discuss a top priority for the U.S. Coast Guard: cybersecurity in the
marine transportation system (MTS). Since the early days of the Revenue
Cutter Service, we have protected our Nation's waters, harbors, and
ports. While much has changed over the centuries--with our missions
expanding from sea, air, and land into cyberspace--our ethos and
operational doctrine remain steadfast. We employ a risk-based approach
to protect the Nation from threats in the maritime environment.
Regardless of the threat, we leverage the full set of our authorities;
the ingenuity and leadership of our people; and the breadth of our
civil, military, and law enforcement partnerships to protect the
Nation, its waterways, and those who operate on them.
I recognize that protecting the MTS from cyber threats is also a
top priority for Congress. The Coast Guard thanks Congress for Fiscal
Year 2021 appropriations that will deliver more cyber risk management
capability for the nation and build a more resilient MTS. The Coast
Guard is committed to maximizing the return on this important
investment and we look forward to the continued dialog with Congress on
such a critical issue for our country.
The Criticality of the Marine Transportation System
Our national security and economic prosperity are inextricably
linked to a safe and efficient MTS. One of the challenges with
protecting the MTS is that it can be difficult to quantify. It is an
integrated network that consists of 25,000 miles of coastal and inland
waters and rivers serving 361 ports. But it is more than ports and
waterways. It is cargo and cruise ships, passenger ferries, waterfront
terminals, offshore facilities, buoys and beacons, bridges, and more.
The MTS supports $5.4 trillion of economic activity each year and
accounts for the employment of more than 30 million Americans. It also
enables critical national security sealift capabilities, enabling U.S.
Armed Forces to project and maintain power around the globe.
The maritime transportation of cargo is considered the most
economical, environmentally friendly, and efficient mode of freight
transport. As the economic lifeblood of the global economy and critical
to U.S. national interests, the MTS connects America's consumers,
producers, manufacturers, and farmers to domestic and global markets.
Any significant disruption to the MTS, whether man-made or natural, has
the potential to cause cascading and devastating impact to our domestic
and global supply chain and, consequently, America's economy and
national security.
The Growing Cyber Risks
Cyber attacks are a significant threat to the economic prosperity
and security of the MTS, and will require a whole of nation effort to
address the threat. The MTS's complex, interconnected network of
information, sensors, and infrastructure continually evolves to promote
the efficient transport of goods and services around the world. The
information technology and operational technology networks vital to
increasing the efficiency and transparency of the MTS also create
complicated interdependencies, vulnerabilities, and risks.
The size, complexity, and importance of the MTS make it an
attractive target. Terrorists, criminals, activists, adversary nation
states and state-sponsored actors may view a significant MTS disruption
as favorable to their interests. The diversity of potential malicious
actors and their increasing levels of sophistication present
substantial challenges to government agencies and stakeholders focused
on protecting the MTS from constantly evolving cyber threats.
Recent destructive cyber activities highlight the risk posed to the
vast networks and system of the MTS. Cyber attacks, such as ransomware
attacks, can have a devastating impact on the operations of maritime
critical infrastructure. A successful cyber attack could impose
unrecoverable losses to port operations, electronically-stored
information, national economic activity, and disruption to global
supply chains. The increased use of automated systems in shipping,
offshore platforms, and port and cargo facilities creates enormous
efficiencies, but also introduces additional attack vectors for
malicious cyber actors. This growing reliance on cyber-physical systems
and technologies requires a comprehensive approach by all MTS
stakeholders to manage cyber risks and ensure the safety and security
of the MTS.
Shared Responsibility
The U.S. Coast Guard is the Nation's lead federal agency for
safeguarding the MTS. We apply a proven prevention and response
framework to prevent or mitigate disruption to the MTS from the many
risks it faces. Our authorities and capabilities cut across threat
vectors, allowing operational commanders at the port level to quickly
evaluate risks, apply resources, and lead a coordinated and effective
response.
Just like the other risks we manage, the maritime industry has a
vital role in cyber risk management--Cyber risk management is a shared
responsibility. In a number of forums and industry engagements, I hear
the consistent message that cybersecurity does not have a one-size-
fits-all solution. I agree with that assessment. However, the building
blocks of sound cyber risk management practices have common threads
across the maritime industry and other critical infrastructure sectors.
It starts with accountability and focus. First, companies need to
identify and empower a responsible person with the authority and
resources to address the cyber challenge. Then, companies need to have
a plan. This includes conducting vulnerability assessments, identifying
gaps, and working to close them. Third, companies need to exercise
their plan, so cybersecurity is ingrained in all of the work they do.
Lastly, companies need to report cyber incidents--reporting of
cybersecurity incidents is absolutely critical because it enables a
coordinated response, and more importantly, can help to inform other
companies and critical infrastructure to take action and mitigate risk.
Information sharing is clearly an essential component of our shared
responsibility, and we have heard from industry that it must happen at
the ``speed of cyber'' to spur meaningful prevention and response
activities. While we have existing information sharing networks--within
the Coast Guard and across government--we must deliver specific, timely
information with appropriate levels of privacy protection in order to
build trust and confidence in the system. Without that trust, we will
lose the massive benefit of the industry's perspectives, experiences,
and trends.
The U.S. Coast Guard's Approach
For the U.S. Coast Guard, protecting the MTS from threats is not
new, and we will continue to leverage our foundational operational
concepts and strong relationships to strengthen the cyber resiliency of
the MTS. In August of 2021, we released a new Coast Guard Cyber
Strategic Outlook that outlines our strategic direction for facing
cyber threat. One of the three primary Lines of Effort is to ``Protect
the Marine Transportation System,'' and a fundamental element for this
effort is applying our proven prevention and response framework.
Prevention
The Prevention Concept of Operations--Standards, Compliance, and
Assessment--guides all of our prevention missions including our cyber
risk management activities. It begins with establishing expectations in
the MTS. Regulations and standards provide a set of minimum
requirements, and are critical to establishing effective and consistent
governance regimes. With effective standards in place, compliance
activities systematically verify that the governance regime is working.
This part of the system is vital in identifying and correcting
potential risks before they advance further and negatively impact the
MTS. Effective assessment is paramount to continuous improvement. It
provides process feedback and facilitates the identification of system
failures so that corrective actions can be taken to improve standards
and compliance activities.
Importantly, we are operationalizing this framework at the port-
level. U.S. Coast Guard Captains of the Port are overseeing Maritime
Transportation Security Act (MTSA)-regulated facilities as they
incorporate cybersecurity into their mandated Facility Security
Assessments and Facility Security Plans. We have provided the industry
with detailed guidance on ways to meet the regulatory requirements
related to computer systems and networks, including personnel training,
drills and exercises, communication, vessel interfaces, security
systems, access control, cargo handling, delivery of stores, and
restricted area monitoring. On October 1, 2021, Coast Guard field units
began reviewing these Facility Security Assessments and Facility
Security Plans to validate that cybersecurity is satisfactorily
addressed, and all MTSA-regulated facilities will be inspected for
compliance by September 30, 2022.
The U.S. Coast Guard worked closely with the International Maritime
Organization on guidelines for commercial vessels operating
internationally to integrate cyber risk management into mandated safety
management systems. During regular inspections, the U.S. Coast Guard is
verifying that foreign vessels operating in U.S. waters are complying
with these requirements.
The U.S. Coast Guard is hiring Cybersecurity Advisors at each Area,
District, and Captain of the Port Zone. These new positions create a
dedicated staff to build and maintain port level cyber-related
relationships, facilitate information sharing across industry and
government, advise Coast Guard and Unified Command decision-makers, and
plan cyber-related security exercises.
Finally, Coast Guard Cyber Command's (CGCYBER) Maritime Cyber
Readiness Branch is assessing technology employed in the MTS,
evaluating known or potential threats, and sharing information across
industry and government. Their Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs) are
conducting detailed vulnerability assessments of maritime critical
infrastructure when requested to help the industry identify and close
gaps in their cybersecurity systems.
Response
Similar to our Prevention Concept of Operations, the U.S. Coast
Guard has a proven, scalable response framework that can be tailored
for all-hazards. This is especially important as cyber incidents can
quickly transition to physical impact requiring operational commanders
to immediately deploy assets to mitigate risks. Depending on the
incident's size and severity, commanders will set clear response
priorities, request specialized resources to help mitigate risk, and
notify interagency partners to help coordinate the response. We are not
approaching this alone.
By regulation, MTSA-regulated vessels and facilities are required
to report Transportation Security Incidents, breaches of security, and
suspicious activity without delay. We have provided additional guidance
on reporting requirements specifically related to cyber incidents.
These reports enable our operational commanders to rapidly notify other
government agencies, evaluate associated risks, deploy resources, and
unify the response.
CGCYBER is also bringing specialized operational capability to MTS
cyber response. These teams will support maritime critical
infrastructure owners and operators after a cyber attack and provide
extensive technical expertise for post-incident investigation,
response, and recovery. Their cyber skills are unprecedented for our
Service.
While we are converting our strategy into action, we know our work
is not done. Through all of these prevention and response activities in
the field and engagements with industry, the U.S. Coast Guard will
capture lessons learned, recommendations, and best practices that
strengthen the maritime industry's cybersecurity posture and inform
future policy, law, and regulations.
Partnerships
MTS cyber risk management requires a whole-of-government effort to
protect America's critical infrastructure. As the Federal Maritime
Security Coordinator, the U.S. Coast Guard Captain of the Port directs
Area Maritime Security Committee (AMSC) activities. AMSCs are required
by federal regulations and serve an essential coordinating function
during normal operations and emergency response. They are comprised of
government agency and maritime industry leaders, and have adapted to
the cyber threat, serving as the primary local means to jointly
evaluate cyber risks, share threat information, and participate in
cyber preparedness exercises.
In addition to being the federal government's lead regulator for
the MTS, we are also the co-Sector Risk Management Agency (SRMA), along
with the Department of Transportation for the Maritime Transportation
Subsector, as outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 21. As an SRMA,
we are responsible for coordinating risk management efforts, including
cyber, with DHS, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA), other Federal departments and agencies, and MTS stakeholders.
We also provide, support, and facilitate technical assistance for the
MTS to address vulnerabilities and develop processes and procedures to
mitigate risk.
CISA is a key partner in all of our cyber risk management
activities. CISA's technical expertise directly supports our ability to
leverage our authorities and experience as the regulator and SRMA of
the MTS. CISA provides technical expertise, integrates a whole-of-
government response, analyzes broader immediate and long-term impacts,
and facilitates information sharing across transportation sectors. Our
relationship with CISA is strong and will continue to mature.
Our enduring relationship with the Department of Defense (DoD) is
also crucial to safeguarding the MTS. In many cases, DoD's ability to
surge forces from domestic to allied seaports depends on the same
commercial maritime infrastructure as the MTS. We must ensure our surge
capability and sea lines of communication will be secure and available
during times of crisis. By sharing intelligence on cyber threats,
developing interoperable capabilities like Cyber Protection Teams, and
using DoD's expertise to protect our own cyber networks, we enable
national security sealift capabilities and jointly support our nation's
ability to project power around the globe.
Future Focus
Recent cyber incidents, including attacks on multiple segments of
maritime critical infrastructure only reinforce that cyberspace is a
contested domain. Working in close collaboration with the Department of
Homeland Security, CISA, and our other government partners, foreign
allies, and the maritime industry, we will continue to leverage strong
and established relationships across the maritime industry--at the
international, national, and port levels--to build confidence and
establish trust through cyber prevention and response activities.
We have secured and safeguarded the maritime environment for over
230 years. During that time we have faced many complex challenges.
These trials have honed our operating concepts, bolstered our
capabilities, and strengthened our resolve. We will employ these same
concepts and capabilities to secure and protect our Nation and maritime
critical infrastructure from malicious cyber activity and cyber
attacks. In addressing cyber risks to ports and other aspects of the
maritime industry, our commitment is to address those risks with the
same level of professionalism, efficiency, and effectiveness that the
public has come to expect. The Coast Guard will continue to adapt, as
it has done over the last two centuries, to the challenges and
opportunities that accompany technological advancements in our
operating environment.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and thank you for
your continued support of the United States Coast Guard. I am pleased
to answer your questions.

Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Admiral.
Mr. Kevin Dorsey?
Mr. Dorsey. Good morning. Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member
Graves, and distinguished members of the committee, thank you
for inviting me to testify on securing our Nation's
infrastructure in an evolving cybersecurity landscape.
The Department of Transportation relies on over 400 IT
systems to ensure the safety and efficiency of our Nation's
transportation system.
As you know, malicious cyberattacks and other compromises
to these systems and DOT networks may put public safety,
sensitive information, or taxpayer dollars at risk. Our office
has long identified cybersecurity as one of the Department's
top management challenges.
Today I will focus on three key areas: one, developing a
comprehensive, DOT-wide cybersecurity strategy to address
recurring weaknesses; two, protecting IT infrastructure and
sensitive information within DOT's operating administrations;
and three, coordinating with other agencies and industry
partners.
First, on the whole, DOT has established formal policies
and procedures for a cybersecurity program that align with
Federal guidelines. However, it still faces challenges
implementing this program in a consistent or comprehensive
manner. As a result, DOT faces the risk that its mission-
critical systems could be compromised. Our office has reported
on longstanding deficiencies due to DOT's inconsistent
enforcement of an enterprisewide information security program,
ineffective communication with its operating administrations,
and inadequate efforts to remediate recurring weaknesses.
Many of these weaknesses can be attributed to DOT's lack of
progress in addressing 66 of our prior audit recommendations,
including those to resolve more than 10,000 identified
vulnerabilities.
Leadership challenges also limit DOT's oversight. For
example, the individual serving as the acting chief information
security officer over the last year was not tasked with
information security as an official primary duty. That has made
it difficult for DOT to implement long-term changes.
Second, DOT must better protect the IT infrastructure
managed by its operating administrations. For example, to
increase cybersecurity, FAA must finish selecting and
implementing more stringent security controls for 45 high-
impact systems that are critical for safely managing air
traffic.
In addition, unresolved security control deficiencies with
FTA's financial management systems could impede its ability to
disburse billions of grant dollars.
Furthermore, during vulnerability assessments and
penetration testing of the IT infrastructure at multiple
operating administrations, we were able to gain unauthorized
access to millions of sensitive records, including personal
identifiable information.
Finally, DOT is one of the lead agencies designated to
protect the Nation's transportation infrastructure. As such, it
must effectively partner with other Federal agencies and the
private sector on efforts such as securing cloud-based services
and meeting the President's recently issued Executive order on
improving cybersecurity. To that end, FAA is working with DHS
and DoD on the Aviation Cyber Initiative. Still, as the U.S.
upgrades its transportation infrastructure, DOT must continue
to strengthen and secure its IT systems and networks, while
working to improve its efforts to respond to increasingly
sophisticated malicious cyber campaigns.
We remain committed to supporting DOT's efforts as it works
to remediate existing vulnerabilities and bolster its overall
cybersecurity posture. We will continue to update you on our
work on these and related matters.
This concludes my prepared statement. I would be happy to
address any questions from you or members of the committee at
this time.
[Mr. Dorsey's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Kevin Dorsey, Assistant Inspector General for
Information Technology Audits, Office of Inspector General, U.S.
Department of Transportation
Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and Distinguished Members
of the Committee:
Thank you for inviting me to testify today on securing our Nation's
infrastructure in an evolving cybersecurity landscape. As you know, the
Department of Transportation (DOT) aims to ensure the United States has
the safest, most efficient, and modern transportation system in the
world. DOT relies on over 400 information technology (IT) systems to
carry out this mission, including systems that manage air traffic,
administer hundreds of billions of dollars, and maintain sensitive
information about the transportation industry. DOT's cybersecurity
program must protect these systems from malicious attacks and other
compromises that may put public safety or taxpayer dollars at risk.
DOT has expressed a commitment to improving its cybersecurity.
Nevertheless, recent cyberattacks remind us why the Department must be
prepared at all times to manage cyber threats, which may originate in
unfriendly nation-states, international criminal syndicates, and even
within the United States. Due to the increasing threat of sophisticated
cyberattacks, DOT must frequently update its digital infrastructure, as
well as its methodology for monitoring networks, detecting potential
risks, identifying malicious activity, and mitigating threats to
sensitive information and information systems.
Our office has long identified cybersecurity as one of the
Department's top management challenges--a challenge that will be
compounded as DOT embarks on implementing new requirements under the
President's recent Executive Order to improve the Nation's
cybersecurity.\1\ My testimony today is based on our recent and ongoing
audit work and will focus on DOT's challenges in three areas: (1)
developing a comprehensive Departmentwide cybersecurity strategy to
address recurring weaknesses, (2) protecting IT infrastructure and
sensitive information at DOT Operating Administrations (OA), and (3)
coordinating with other agencies and industry partners on cybersecurity
in the transportation sector.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Executive Order 14028: Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity
(May 12, 2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
While DOT has formalized and documented most of the policies and
procedures for its cybersecurity program, the Department continues to
face significant challenges in its implementation. These challenges are
due to persistent deficiencies caused by the inconsistent enforcement
of an enterprise-wide information security program, ineffective
communication with the OAs, leadership gaps, and inadequate efforts to
remediate the issues associated with 66 of our prior-year audit
recommendations. As a result, DOT faces the risk that its mission-
critical systems could be compromised. While working to strengthen its
cybersecurity posture across the Department, DOT must also address
ongoing challenges in protecting the IT infrastructure that its OAs
manage and monitor. These challenges include selecting and implementing
more stringent security controls \2\ for the Federal Aviation
Administration's (FAA) high-impact systems that are critical for safely
managing air traffic. We also recently reported that the Federal
Transit Administration's (FTA) financial management systems have
several security control deficiencies that could affect its ability to
approve, process, and disburse billions of dollars of grant funds.
Furthermore, our ongoing series of audits of the cybersecurity postures
at multiple OAs has identified security weaknesses that could
compromise millions of sensitive data records, including personally
identifiable information (PII). These weaknesses are of particular
concern given that OA networks are connected to DOT's overall IT
infrastructure, exposing it to further risk. Finally, as one of the
lead agencies \3\ in protecting the critical infrastructure of the
Nation's transportation sector, DOT must effectively partner with other
Federal agencies and the private sector to improve cybersecurity, such
as when securing cloud-based services. Such efforts are critically
important because the incapacitation or destruction of transportation
assets, systems, and networks would have a debilitating effect on the
Nation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Security controls are safeguards or countermeasures designed to
protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information
that is processed, stored, or transmitted by systems or organizations
and to manage information security risk.
\3\ The other lead agency is the Department of Homeland Security.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
New guidance from the President has changed the manner in which
executive agencies must identify and manage risk associated with
information systems. Issued on May 12, 2021, Executive Order 14028:
Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity, directs the Federal Government to
improve its efforts to identify, deter, protect against, detect, and
respond to persistent and increasingly sophisticated malicious cyber
campaigns that threaten the public and private sectors and ultimately
the security and privacy of the American people. To protect our Nation
from malicious cyber actors and foster a more secure cyberspace, the
Order also requires the Federal Government to partner with the private
sector, which must adapt to the continuously changing threat
environment and ensure its products are built and operate securely.
DOT's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), under
authority granted by the Secretary of Transportation, has issued the
Departmental Cybersecurity Policy,\4\ which establishes the policies,
processes, procedures, and standards of the DOT cybersecurity program.
The policy also implements the mandatory requirements specified for all
Federal agencies in the Federal Information Security Modernization Act
of 2014 (FISMA), as amended,\5\ and other laws, regulations, and
standards related to information security, information assurance, and
network security. FISMA requires Federal agencies to develop, document,
and implement agencywide cybersecurity programs to protect the
information and information systems that support their operations and
assets. Under FISMA, DOT must provide information security protection
commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the harm that could result
from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or
destruction of:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ DOT Order 1351.37, Departmental Cybersecurity Policy, July 14,
2017.
\5\ Pub. L. No. 113-283 (December 18, 2014).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

information collected or maintained by or on behalf of
DOT; and

information systems used or operated by DOT employees or
contractors or by another organization on DOT's behalf.

DOT is also required to implement mandatory cybersecurity
requirements issued by other entities, including, but not limited to,
the White House, Congress, Department of Homeland Security (DHS),
Office of Management and Budget(OMB), and National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST). The Department has adopted NIST's Risk
Management Framework as the standard methodology for security
authorization for its information systems and continuous monitoring of
security controls.
Developing a Comprehensive Departmentwide Cybersecurity Strategy To
Address Recurring Weaknesses
For the most part, DOT has formalized and documented its
cybersecurity policies and procedures for protecting its information
systems and data. Specifically the Departmental Cybersecurity Policy,
and its supplement, the Departmental Cybersecurity Compendium,
authorize DOT's Chief Information Officer (CIO) to secure all IT,
information systems, networks, and data that support DOT operations.
Moreover, in the wake of increased telework during the Coronavirus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the OCIO upgraded security and
tripled departmental network bandwidth. These actions ensured that
employees working from home could access systems and data to fulfill
their responsibilities.
The Department's formal policies align with Federal guidelines--
specifically, those for security controls for identifying and managing
risks, protecting information systems, detecting potential
cybersecurity incidents, and responding to and recovering from
incidents. However, DOT does not implement them in a consistent or
comprehensive manner. As a result, the Department faces the risk that
its mission-critical systems could be compromised.
Since 2003, we have conducted annual reviews of DOT's information
security programs and practices, in accordance with FISMA requirements.
As we reported in our most recent FISMA audit,\6\ the Department has
yet to address longstanding cybersecurity deficiencies related to its
practices for protecting its mission-critical systems from unauthorized
access, alteration, or destruction. For example, we continue to note
inconsistencies in DOT's implementation of its cybersecurity program
(see table).

Table. Weaknesses in DOT's Implementation of Its Cybersecurity Program
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Category                                      Issues OIG Identified in 2021
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Risk management..........................   Inventories: DOT did not maintain accurate and complete inventories
of all OA information systems and was unable to demonstrate that it
had a formal process in place for ensuring the accuracy and
completeness of the hardware asset inventories it reports to OMB--key
prerequisites to an effective risk-management program
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Security controls: DOT did not always test the security controls for
its information systems or properly approve security assessment and
authorization documentation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tracking vulnerabilities: DOT did not always report, manage, and
close security weaknesses identified in plans of action and
milestones (POA&M)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Supply chain risk management: DOT has not developed a supply chain
risk management strategy and implementation plan to ensure that
external providers comply with departmental cybersecurity
requirements
rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Protecting DOT's information systems from         Configuration management: DOT has not consistently remediated
risk of compromise......................   vulnerabilities related to unsupported operating systems, unpatched
applications, and configuration weaknesses, which may allow
unauthorized access into mission-critical systems and data
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Identity and access management: Employees and contractors do not
always access the DOT network with personal identity verification
(PIV) cards because many Department systems are not enabled to use
PIV cards or do not require them
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Data protection and privacy: DOT does not always review privacy
documentation designed for the protection of PII each year; in some
cases, the documentation is not current or has not been developed.
This puts the PII stored in DOT's information systems at risk for
compromise
rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Detecting potential cybersecurity threats      Information security continuous monitoring: DOT does not conduct
annual security control assessments on some systems. As a result, it
lacks an ongoing awareness of information security, vulnerabilities,
and threats to systems and information
rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Responding to cybersecurity incidents....  Incident response: DOT did not provide evidence that it evaluates the
effectiveness of its incident response technologies or adjusts
configurations and toolsets as appropriate, raising questions about
the effectiveness of its automated detection capabilities. DOT's
Security Operations Center also does not have file-integrity checking
software for detecting signs of cyber incidents
rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Recovering from cybersecurity incidents..  Contingency plans: DOT does not test all of its contingency plans on
an annual basis; other plans have not been developed, reviewed, or
updated in a timely manner. Comprehensive testing is crucial to
ensure organizational systems and data are available and that IT
systems and applications can function during outages
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Source: Independent auditor analysis

Many of these and other weaknesses can be attributed to the
Department's lack of progress in addressing our 66 prior-year audit
recommendations. DOT has struggled to remediate its security weaknesses
in a timely manner and has yet to close 10,663 vulnerabilities
associated with its information systems, as compared with the 10,385
weaknesses we found in 2020.\7\ Figure 1 identifies the number of DOT
plans of action and milestones (POA&M) that have remained open for the
past 6 years.

Source: OIG analysis of DOT data

Furthermore, as early as 2012, we identified high-risk security
vulnerabilities--including inconsistent software updates--that an
attacker could exploit to control systems or access files and data.
Since 2013, DOT has not had a comprehensive and accurate inventory of
its information systems and, as a result, may be unable to identify and
address all system vulnerabilities. The Department has also not
resolved our 2018 recommendation to develop and maintain accurate
inventories of cloud systems, contractor systems, and websites that
allow public access. The lack of accurate inventories of its hardware
assets may be even more critical in light of the increased use of
telework in response to COVID-19.
These vulnerabilities are compounded by the inconsistent
enforcement of a Departmentwide information security program. For one,
DOT has not had a permanent Chief Information Security Officer with the
leadership authority to perform effective oversight and ensure
accountability for departmental information security improvements for
close to a year. Thus, it is challenging for DOT to move forward with a
continuity of strategy that can affect long-term changes. To address
these longstanding and recurring cybersecurity weaknesses, we made one
overarching key recommendation to the Department this year: require the
OCIO to develop a multiyear strategy and approach--complete with
objective milestones and resource commitments--to implement the
necessary corrective actions to ensure an effective information
security program. To DOT's credit, it agreed with our recommendation
and directed the CIO to develop and implement such an approach by
December 2022.
Protecting IT Infrastructure and Sensitive Information at DOT Operating
Administrations
Our recent audit work shows that DOT faces ongoing challenges
protecting the IT infrastructure that its OAs manage and monitor. This
infrastructure includes systems that are integral to the safe and
efficient operation of our Nation's transportation system; help manage
the disbursement of billions of dollars to grantees; and contain
sensitive information, including PII.
Strengthening Security Controls for High-Impact Systems at FAA
The Department faces some of its most significant cybersecurity
challenges at FAA, which owns 325--or about 75 percent--of DOT's 431
information technology systems. Specifically, FAA operates a vast
network of systems and facilities for managing air traffic in the
National Airspace System (NAS). This complex network has evolved over
the years into an amalgam of diverse legacy radars and newer satellite-
based systems for tracking aircraft, as well as a new initiative for
controllers and pilots to share information through data link
communications.
Recognizing the importance of protecting its infrastructure from
rapidly evolving cyber-based threats, FAA recently re-categorized 45
low- and moderate-impact systems as high impact. According to the
Federal Information Processing Standards,\8\ a high-impact system is
one in which a security breach or loss is expected to have a severe or
catastrophically adverse effect on organizational operations, assets,
or individuals. For example, one of the recently re-categorized systems
is the En Route Automation Modernization system, which air traffic
controllers rely on to manage high-altitude air traffic nationwide.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 199 (FIPS
199), Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and
Information Systems, February 2004.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re-categorizing a system as high impact creates more stringent
security control requirements to safeguard the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of information processed or stored on the
system. However, we recently reported that FAA lacks formalized
policies and procedures for selecting and implementing high security
controls for its high-impact systems.\9\ As FAA's reliance on
interconnectivity increases, so does the risk of cybersecurity
breaches, which can have a significant impact on the NAS. To increase
cybersecurity, FAA must complete its selection and implementation of
all required high-security controls for these mission-critical systems.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ FAA Is Taking Steps to Properly Categorize High-Impact
Information Systems but Security Risks Remain Until High Security
Controls Are Implemented (OIG Report No. IT2021033), August 2, 2021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protecting FTA's Financial Management Systems
We recently reported \10\ that FTA's financial management systems
have several security control deficiencies that could affect the
Agency's ability to approve, process, and disburse grant funds,
including nearly $70 billion in COVID-19 relief appropriations.
Security controls for FTA financial management systems are especially
critical given that the transit industry is vulnerable to cyberattacks.
For example, we reported that in 2020 and 2021, at least five FTA grant
recipients were victims of cyberattacks that exposed PII, personnel
data, and financial data. Grant recipients' security incidents may
result in the compromise of usernames and credentials and expose FTA to
cyberattacks that may delay the distribution of COVID-19 related funds
to recipients.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\10\ FTA Does Not Effectively Assess Security Controls or Remediate
Cybersecurity Weaknesses To Ensure the Proper Safeguards Are in Place
To Protect Its Financial Management Systems (OIG Report No. IT2022005),
October 20, 2021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite these risks, we found that FTA did not always effectively
select, document, implement, and monitor the security controls for its
financial management systems. For example, FTA security officials
reported that 139 of 269 security controls were satisfied, but we found
they were not tested or implemented as required. As a result of these
and other issues, FTA officials may not have accurate pictures of
security risks. Additionally, FTA has not remediated longstanding
security control weaknesses that it has identified since 2016--
including issues with multifactor authentication--which increases the
risk that malicious actors could gain unauthorized access. Other
weaknesses include unsecure databases, a lack of integrity monitoring
tools, and insufficient contingency and incident response planning. If
compromised, these weaknesses could lead to a cybersecurity attack.
Safeguarding PII by Preventing Cyberattacks at Multiple OAs
Several of our recent reviews have raised concerns regarding
whether the OAs have the appropriate security controls in place to
protect DOT's networks and information systems from unauthorized
access, including insider threats. In our recent audits of the
cybersecurity postures at the Volpe National Transportation Systems
Center (Volpe), Maritime Administration (MARAD), and Federal Motor
Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA),\11\ we identified and could have
exploited security weaknesses and accessed millions of data records. As
part of our vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, we were
able to access to millions of sensitive records, including PII (see
figure 2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ The Volpe Center's Information Technology Infrastructure Is at
Risk for Compromise (OIG Report No. FI2016056), March 22, 2016; The
Maritime Administration's Information Technology Infrastructure Is at
Risk for Compromise (OIG Report No. FI2019057), July 24, 2019; FMCSA's
IT Infrastructure Is at Risk of Compromise (OIG Report No. IT2022003),
October 20, 2021.

Access at Volpe, MARAD, and FMCSA

Source: Results of OIG audits of Volpe, MARAD, and FMCSA security
postures conducted in 2016, 2019, and 2021, respectively.

For example, we successfully penetrated FMCSA's infrastructure and
gained unauthorized access to 13 million PII records. If breached,
these systems could have cost the Department millions of dollars in
credit monitoring fees to protect affected individuals from identity
theft. We also identified recurring weaknesses that we could exploit,
including poor security practices, such as weak administrative-level
login credentials, unpatched servers and workstations, and a lack of
encryption of sensitive data.
Many of the weaknesses we found at FMCSA also tie into the same
persistent enterprise-level security risks we found during our audits
of MARAD and Volpe's IT networks and systems. These weaknesses are of
particular concern given that these OAs' networks process, store, and
transmit a substantial amount of sensitive information and are
connected to DOT's overall network. Until the Department implements
appropriate safeguards and countermeasures to protect its networks, DOT
and its OAs will continue to be at risk for an enterprise-wide
cybersecurity attack that could have a major impact on mission-critical
systems. We plan to continue to review the IT infrastructure at
individual OAs; our fourth audit in this series will focus on the
Federal Highway Administration.
Coordinating With Other Agencies and Industry Partners To Ensure
Cybersecurity in the Transportation Sector
As a lead agency in protecting the critical infrastructure of the
Nation's transportation sector, DOT must partner effectively with other
Federal agencies and industry to mitigate vulnerabilities and ensure
cybersecurity. Both DHS and DOT have the authority and responsibility
to protect the U.S. transportation sector from physical and cyber
threats.\12\ DOT also coordinates with other Federal agencies and
industry partners. For example, the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security
Act of 2016 directs FAA to develop a comprehensive, strategic framework
to reduce cybersecurity risks to civil aviation. FAA's efforts to
implement this framework involve coordinating and collaborating on
aviation cybersecurity with DHS and the Department of Defense through
the Aviation Cyber Initiative. Protecting flight-critical systems--and
the safety of the flying public--from rapidly evolving cyber-based
threats also requires the cooperation of aviation stakeholders from
industry, airlines, airports, and manufacturers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\12\ See Executive Order 14028: Improving the Nation's
Cybersecurity (May 12, 2021) and Presidential Policy Directive 21:
Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience (February 12, 2013).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOT's collaboration and coordination across the transportation
sector is of critical importance because the incapacitation or
destruction of transportation assets, systems, or networks would have a
debilitating effect on the Nation's security, economy, and public
health and safety. On May 8, 2021, for example, the Colonial Pipeline
Company announced that it had halted its pipeline operations due to a
ransomware attack, disrupting critical supplies of gasoline and other
refined products throughout the East Coast. This incident and other
cyberattacks have elevated concerns about the security of the Nation's
critical infrastructure, including energy pipelines and the
transportation sector.
Accordingly, we will monitor DOT's ongoing efforts to ensure
cybersecurity in the transportation sector, particularly as it
increasingly relies on private-sector partners for internet-based
computing services (commonly referred to as cloud services) to address
IT needs. To that end, we have initiated a review of the Department's
strategy to secure cloud services and transition toward zero trust
architecture, key provisions of Executive Order 14028. As defined by
NIST,\13\ zero trust focuses on protecting resources (assets, services,
workflows, network accounts, etc.), rather than network location, which
is no longer seen as the prime component of an entity's security
posture. We will keep the committee updated on our progress in
monitoring and assessing the Department's cybersecurity program,
including its partnerships with the private sector and other agencies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\ NIST Special Publication 800-207, Zero Trust Architecture,

assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network
location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or on asset
ownership (enterprise or personally owned).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
DOT's cybersecurity program is critical to protect its vast network
of IT systems from malicious attacks and other breaches that pose a
threat to the U.S. transportation system. In today's rapidly evolving
cybersecurity landscape, and as the Nation embarks on a new journey to
upgrade and improve its transportation infrastructure, DOT faces
significant challenges in strengthening its systems while adapting to
new and rising challenges and threats. We remain committed to
supporting the Department's efforts as it works to remediate existing
vulnerabilities and bolster DOT's overall cybersecurity posture. We
will continue to update you on our work on these and related matters.
This concludes my prepared statement. I would be happy to address
any questions from you or Members of the Committee at this time.

Mr. DeFazio. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Dorsey.
And now, finally--this is ridiculous [referring to his
laryngitis]--Mr. Nick Marinos.
Mr. Marinos. Thank you, Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member
Graves, and members of the committee for inviting GAO to
contribute to this important discussion about critical
infrastructure cybersecurity.
As you know, our Nation's infrastructure increasingly
relies on IT systems to carry out operations, and the
protection of these systems is vital to public confidence and
safety, and to national security.
GAO has long emphasized the urgent need for the Federal
Government to improve its ability to protect against cyber
threats to our Nation's infrastructure. In fact, we have
designated cybersecurity as a Governmentwide, high-risk area
since 1997. Our most recent high-risk updates to Congress
emphasize the need for the Federal Government to address major
cybersecurity challenges through 10 critical actions. Today I
will focus on two of them.
The first is the need to develop and execute a
comprehensive, national cyber strategy, and the second is the
need to strengthen the Federal role in protecting critical
infrastructure from cyber threats.
Over the last several decades, the Federal Government has
struggled in establishing a national strategy to guide how we
plan to engage both domestically and internationally on cyber-
related issues. Last year, we reported that the prior
administration's national cyber strategy needed improvements,
and that it was unclear which official was ultimately
responsible for coordinating the execution of the national
strategy. We recommended that the National Security Council
update the document, and that Congress consider passing
legislation to designate a position in the White House to lead
such an effort.
In January, we saw Congress pass a law that established the
Office of the National Cyber Director within the Executive
Office of the President. And in June, the Senate confirmed a
Director to lead this new office. While this is an important
step forward, until we see the executive branch establish a
comprehensive strategy, our Government will continue to operate
without a clear roadmap for how it intends to overcome the
cyber threats facing the Nation.
We have also long reported that the Federal Government has
been challenged in working with the private sector to protect
our Nation's critical infrastructure from cyberattacks. Since
2010, we have made over 80 recommendations aimed at
strengthening the role in critical infrastructure. This
includes by enhancing the capabilities and services of DHS's
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as
CISA, and ensuring that Federal agencies with sector-specific
responsibilities are providing their sector partners with the
effective guidance and support they need. These include
important corrective actions within the transportation sector,
too, such as improving FAA's oversight of commercial airplane
cybersecurity, and TSA's oversight of the cybersecurity of both
critical pipeline and passenger rail systems.
Finally, I would like to highlight the urgency for Federal
agencies to implement all of the cyber-related recommendations
that have come out of the work performed by GAO and the
inspectors general. Since 2010, GAO has made over 3,700
recommendations on cyber-related topics. Many of these
recommendations extend far beyond topics related to critical
infrastructure, but they represent work that is needed to
elevate the entire Federal Government in its ability to tackle
today's cyber problems, and to anticipate those we will face in
the future.
For example, they deal with important workforce issues,
such as our recommendation to the Department of Transportation
that it assess its skill gaps in order to better oversee
automated technologies like those that control planes, trains,
or vehicles without human intervention.
They also call for improvements to Federal agencies' own
protections, such as through our recommendations to DHS that it
work with agencies, including FAA, to better implement
cybersecurity tools that check for vulnerabilities and insecure
configurations on agency networks.
Although agencies deserve credit for implementing many of
our recommendations, over 900 still have yet to be implemented,
including over 50 related to improving critical infrastructure
cybersecurity. So clearly, there is a lot more work to do, and
we think that agencies need to move with a greater sense of
urgency to improve their cybersecurity protections.
In summary, in order for our Nation to overcome its ever-
mounting and increasing array of cyber-related challenges, our
Federal Government needs to do a better job of implementing
strategy, oversight, and coordination among Federal agencies,
and with the owners and operators that are on the front lines
of this digital battle.
This concludes my remarks, and I look forward to answering
any questions you may have. Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Nick Marinos, Director, Information Technology
and Cybersecurity, U.S. Government Accountability Office
Cybersecurity: Federal Actions Urgently Needed to Better Protect the
Nation's Critical Infrastructure
Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and Members of the
Committee:
Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to today's discussion
on federal perspectives to secure the nation's infrastructure. As you
know, our nation's critical infrastructure sectors are dependent on
information technology (IT) systems and digital data to carry out
operations and to process, maintain, and report essential
information.\1\ The security of these systems and data is vital to
public confidence and national security, prosperity, and well-being.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The term ``critical infrastructure,'' as defined in the Uniting
and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to
Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, refers to systems and
assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that
their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on
security, national economic security, national public health or safety,
or any combination of these. 42 U.S.C. Sec.  5195c(e). Federal policies
identify 16 critical infrastructure sectors: chemical; commercial
facilities; communications; critical manufacturing; dams; defense
industrial base; emergency services; energy; financial services; food
and agriculture; government facilities; health care and public health;
information technology; nuclear reactors, materials, and waste;
transportation systems; and water and wastewater systems.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have long stressed the urgent need for effective cybersecurity,
as underscored by increasingly sophisticated threats and frequent cyber
incidents.\2\ Recent events, including the ransomware attack that led
to a shutdown of a major U.S. fuel pipeline, have illustrated that the
nation's critical infrastructure and the federal government's IT
systems continue to face growing cyber threats.\3\ The cybersecurity of
critical infrastructure sectors has been a long-standing challenge for
the federal government, underscored by the need for federal agencies to
improve their own cybersecurity posture and enhance the cybersecurity
support provided to the nation's critical infrastructure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ See, for example, GAO, Cybersecurity and Information
Technology: Federal Agencies Need to Strengthen Efforts to Address
High-Risk Areas, GAO-21-105325 (Washington, D.C.: July 28, 2021) and
High-Risk Series: Federal Government Needs to Urgently Pursue Critical
Actions to Address Major Cybersecurity Challenges, GAO-21-288
(Washington, D.C.: Mar. 24, 2021).
\3\ For more information regarding such recent events, see GAO,
Cybersecurity: Federal Agencies Need to Implement Recommendations to
Manage Supply Chain Risks, GAO-21-594T (Washington, D.C.: May 25,
2021). Ransomware is a type of malware used to deny access to IT
systems or data and hold the systems or data hostage until a ransom is
paid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
At your request, my remarks today will focus on the federal
government's efforts to address the cybersecurity of the nation's
critical infrastructure and will highlight critical areas where we have
identified an urgent need for improvement. This statement is based on
the results of our prior work, which includes the reports and
testimonies that we cite throughout this statement. To develop the
statement, we reviewed prior reports and testimonies that described
cyber-related challenges faced by the nation and the extent to which
federal entities have taken actions to address them. More detailed
information about our scope and methodology can be found in the
products cited throughout this statement.
We conducted the work on which this statement is based in
accordance with all sections of GAO's Quality Assurance Framework that
are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and
perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to
meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work.
We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis
conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions.
Background
Information systems supporting federal agencies and our nation's
critical infrastructure--such as transportation systems,
communications, education, energy, and financial services--are
inherently at risk. These systems are highly complex and dynamic,
technologically diverse, and often geographically dispersed. This
complexity increases the difficulty in identifying, managing, and
protecting the numerous operating systems, applications, and devices
comprising the systems and networks. Compounding the risk, systems and
networks used by federal agencies and our nation's critical
infrastructure are also often interconnected with other internal and
external systems and networks, including the internet.
With this greater connectivity, threat actors are increasingly
willing and capable of conducting a cyberattack on our nation's
critical infrastructure that could be disruptive and destructive. The
2021 Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community and
the 2020 Homeland Threat Assessment noted that criminal groups and
nations pose the greatest cyberattack threats to our nation.\4\
According to the 2020 assessment, both criminal groups and nation cyber
actors--motivated by profit, espionage, or disruption--will exploit the
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by targeting the U.S.
health care and public health sector, government response entities, and
the broader emergency services sector.

Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community (April 9, 2021).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recent events highlight the significant cyber threats facing the
nation. For example,

In May 7, 2021, the Colonial Pipeline Company learned
that it was the victim of a cyberattack. A joint alert from the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicated that malicious actors used
ransomware against Colonial Pipeline's information technology
network.\5\ The alert also explained that, to ensure the safety of the
pipeline, the company disconnected certain industrial control systems
that monitor and control physical pipeline functions so that they would
not be compromised by the criminals. According to CISA and the FBI, as
of May 11, 2021, there was no indication that the threat actors had
compromised the industrial control systems. However, disconnecting
these systems resulted in a temporary halt to all pipeline operations.
This, in turn, led to gasoline shortages throughout the southeast
United States.

\5\ CISA and the FBI, DarkSide Ransomware: Best Practices for
Preventing Business Disruption from Ransomware Attacks, Alert (AA21-
131A), May 11, 2021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In February 2021, CISA issued an alert explaining that
cyber threat actors obtained unauthorized access to a U.S. water
treatment facility's industrial controls systems and attempted to
increase the amount of a caustic chemical that is used as part of the
water treatment process. According to CISA, threat actors likely
accessed systems by exploiting cybersecurity weakness, including poor
password security and an outdated operating system.

In December 2020, CISA issued an emergency directive and
alert explaining that an advanced persistent threat actor had
compromised the supply chain of a network management software suite and
inserted a ``backdoor''--a malicious program that can potentially give
an intruder remote access to an infected computer--into a genuine
version of that software product. The malicious actor then used this
backdoor, among other techniques, to initiate a cyberattack campaign
against U.S. government agencies, critical infrastructure entities, and
private sector organizations.
GAO Has Previously Identified Four Major Cybersecurity Challenges
Facing the Nation
To underscore the importance of this issue, we have designated
information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997.\6\
In 2003, we added the protection of critical infrastructure to the
information security high-risk area, and, in 2015, we further expanded
this area to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable
information.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ GAO, High-Risk Series: Information Management and Technology,
HR-97-9 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 1997). GAO maintains a high-risk
program to focus attention on government operations that it identifies
as high-risk due to their greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste,
abuse, and mismanagement or the need for transformation to address
economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.
\7\ GAO, High-Risk Series: An Update, GAO-15-290 (Washington, D.C.:
Feb. 11, 2015) and High-Risk Series: An Update, GAO-03-119 (Washington,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our high-risk updates from September 2018 and March 2021, we
emphasized the critical need for the federal government to take 10
specific actions to address four major cybersecurity challenges that
the federal government faces.\8\ These challenges are: (1) establishing
a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and performing effective
oversight, (2) securing federal systems and information, (3) protecting
cyber critical infrastructure, and (4) protecting privacy and sensitive
data. Figure 1 provides an overview of the critical actions needed to
address these major cybersecurity challenges.

Since 2010, we have made about 3,700 recommendations related to our
high-risk area focused on enhancing our nation's cybersecurity efforts.
As of November 2021, about 900 of those recommendations had yet to be
implemented.
As indicated by the figure above, these recommendations include but
also extend far beyond topics related to critical infrastructure
cybersecurity, representing work across all of the high-risk challenge
areas and calling for urgent actions to help address them. The
following examples reflect the wide range of challenge areas:

Cybersecurity workforce management. In December 2020, we
reported that the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) workforce
faced challenges related to overseeing the safety of automated
technologies, such as those that control a function or task of a plane,
train, or vehicle without human intervention.\9\ These technologies
require regulatory expertise as well as engineering, data analysis, and
cybersecurity skills. Although DOT had identified most skills it needed
to oversee automated technologies, it had not fully assessed whether
its workforce had these skills. Accordingly, we recommended that DOT
(1) assess skill gaps in key occupations involved in overseeing
automated technologies and (2) regularly measure the progress of
strategies implemented to close skill gaps. As of November 2021, these
recommendations had not yet been fully implemented, although DOT
reported it intended to so by June 2022.

Its Workforce Has Skills Needed to Oversee Safety, GAO-21-197
(Washington, D.C.: Dec. 18, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government-wide cybersecurity initiatives. Federal
agencies face cyber threats against that continue to grow in number and
sophistication. The Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program
was established to provide federal agencies with tools and services
that have the intended capability to automate network monitoring,
correlate and analyze security-related information, and enhance risk-
based decision making at agency and government-wide levels. In August
2020, we reported that selected agencies--the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), Indian Health Services, and Small Business
Administration--had generally deployed these tools intended to provide
cybersecurity data to support the Department of Homeland Security's
(DHS) CDM program.\10\ However, while agencies reported that the
program improved their network awareness, none of the three agencies
had effectively implemented all key CDM program requirements. As part
of our review, we made six recommendations to DHS and nine
recommendations to the three selected agencies. DHS and the selected
agencies concurred with the recommendations. As of November 2021, only
one of the recommendations made to DHS had been implemented.

Shortcomings in Implementation of Network Monitoring Program, GAO-20-
598 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 18, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Federal agency cybersecurity risk management. In July
2019, we reported on key practices for establishing an agency-wide
cybersecurity risk management program that include designating a
cybersecurity risk executive, developing a risk management strategy and
policies to facilitate risk-based decisions, assessing cyber risks to
the agency, and establishing coordination with the agency's enterprise
risk management program.\11\ Although the 23 agencies we reviewed
almost always designated a risk executive, they often did not fully
incorporate other key practices in their programs, such as (1)
establishing a cybersecurity risk management strategy to delineate
boundaries for risk-based decisions; (2) establishing a process for
assessing agency-wide cybersecurity risks; and (3) establishing a
process for coordinating between cybersecurity and enterprise risk
management programs for managing all major risks.\12\ We made 57
recommendations to the 23 agencies to address the challenges identified
in our report. As of November 2021, 25 of these recommendations had yet
to be implemented.

Federal Law and Policy Establish Requirements for Critical
Infrastructure Cybersecurity
Federal law and policy establish roles and responsibilities for the
protection of critical infrastructure, discussed in chronological
order.

Executive Order 13636. In February 2013, the White House
issued Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, Executive Order
13636, which called for a partnership with the owners and operators of
critical infrastructure to improve cybersecurity-related information
sharing.\13\ To do so, the order established mechanisms for promoting
engagement between federal and private organizations. Among other
things, the order designated nine federal sector-specific agencies with
lead roles in protecting critical infrastructure sectors. The lead
agencies coordinate federally sponsored activities within their
respective sectors. Further, the order directed DHS, with help from the
lead agencies, to identify, annually review, and update a list of
critical infrastructure sectors for which a cybersecurity incident
could reasonably result in catastrophic effects on public health or
safety, economic security, or national security.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Presidential Policy Directive 21. Also, in February 2013,
the White House issued Presidential Policy Directive 21, Critical
Infrastructure Security and Resilience, to further specify critical
infrastructure responsibilities.\14\ Among other things, the policy
directed DHS to coordinate with lead agencies to develop a description
of functional relationships across the federal government related to
critical infrastructure security and resilience. The policy further
prescribed DHS, in coordination with lead agencies, to conduct an
analysis and recommend options for improving public-private partnership
effectiveness.

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
Cybersecurity Framework. Executive Order 13636 directed NIST to lead
the development of a flexible performance-based cybersecurity framework
that was to include a set of standards, procedures, and processes.\15\
Further, the order directed the lead agencies, in consultation with DHS
and other interested agencies, to coordinate with critical
infrastructure partners to review the cybersecurity framework. The
agencies, if necessary, should develop implementation guidance or
supplemental materials to address sector-specific risks and operating
environments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\15\ The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 authorized NIST to
facilitate and support the development of a voluntary set of standards
to reduce cyber risks to critical infrastructure. 15 U.S.C. Sec.
272(c)(15). The Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure
Cybersecurity represents that voluntary set of standards.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to the order, in February 2014, NIST first
published its framework--a voluntary, flexible, performance-based
framework of cybersecurity standards and procedures. The framework,
which was updated in April 2018, outlines a risk-based approach to
managing cybersecurity that is composed of three major parts: a
framework core, profiles, and implementation tiers.\16\ The framework
core provides a set of activities to achieve specific cybersecurity
outcomes and references examples of guidance to achieve those outcomes.

advance the mission of protecting federal civilian agencies' networks
from cyber threats and to enhance the security of the nation's critical
infrastructure in the face of both physical and cyber threats. To
implement this legislation, CISA undertook a three-phase organizational

Programs Directorate as CISA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year
2021. The act established roles and responsibilities for lead agencies,
known as sector risk management agencies, in protecting the 16 critical
infrastructure agencies.\18\ According to the act, the lead agencies
are required to (1) coordinate with DHS and collaborate with critical
infrastructure owners and operators, regulatory agencies, and others;
(2) support sector risk management, in coordination with CISA; (3)
assess sector risk, in coordination with CISA; (4) coordinate the
sector, including by serving as a day-to-day federal interface for the
prioritization and coordination of sector-specific activities; and (5)
support incident management, including supporting CISA, upon request,
in asset response activities.

and sets out sector risk management agency responsibilities within this
critical infrastructure framework. Pub. L. No. 116-283, Sec.  9002, 134

Federal Actions Urgently Needed to Protect Critical Infrastructure from
Cyber Threats
Over the last several decades, we have emphasized the urgent need
for the federal government to improve its ability to protect against
cyber threats to our nation's infrastructure. In recent high-risk
updates, we emphasized the critical need for the federal government to
address major cybersecurity challenges through critical actions. This
includes the need for the federal government to (1) develop and execute
a comprehensive national cyber strategy and (2) strengthen the federal
role in protecting the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure.
Executive Branch Urgently Needs to Establish and Implement a
Comprehensive National Cyber Strategy
We and others have reported on the challenges in establishing a
comprehensive national strategy to guide how the United States
government will engage both domestically and internationally on
cybersecurity related matters. In September 2020, we reported that the
prior administration's 2018 National Cyber Strategy \19\ and associated
2019 Implementation Plan had collectively detailed the executive
branch's approach to managing the nation's cybersecurity. However,
these documents only addressed some, but not all, of the desirable
characteristics of national strategies, such as goals and resources
needed.\20\ Accordingly, we recommended that the National Security
Council work with relevant federal entities to update cybersecurity
strategy documents to include goals and resource information, among
other things.\21\ The National Security Council staff neither agreed
nor disagreed with our recommendation and has yet to address it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\19\ The White House, National Cyber Strategy of the United States
of America (Washington, D.C.: September 2018).
\20\ GAO, Cybersecurity: Clarity of Leadership Urgently Needed to

Sept. 22, 2020).
\21\ The National Cyber Strategy assigns National Security Council
staff to coordinate with departments, agencies, and the Office of
Management and Budget on a plan to implement the strategy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have also stressed the urgency and necessity of clearly defining
a central leadership role in order to coordinate the government's
efforts to overcome the nation's cyber-related threats and challenges.
In September 2020, we also reported that, in light of the elimination
of the White House Cybersecurity Coordinator position in May 2018, it
was unclear which official within the executive branch ultimately
maintained responsibility for coordinating the execution of the
National Cyber Strategy and related implementation plan. Accordingly,
we suggested that Congress consider legislation to designate a position
in the White House to lead such an effort. In January 2021, the NDAA
for Fiscal Year 2021 established the Office of the National Cyber
Director within the Executive Office of the President.\22\ Among other
responsibilities, the Director is to serve as the principal advisor to
the White House on cybersecurity policy and strategy, including
coordination of implementation of national cyber policy and strategy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

4144 (Jan. 1, 2021) (codified at 6 U.S.C. Sec.  1500).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In June 2021, the Senate confirmed a Director to lead this new
office. In October 2021, the National Cyber Director issued a strategic
intent statement, outlining a vision for the Director's office and the
high-level lines of efforts it intends to focus on, including national
and federal cybersecurity; budget review and assessment; and planning
and incident response, among others.\23\

of the National Cyber Director (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 28, 2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The establishment of a National Cyber Director is an important step
toward positioning the federal government to better direct activities
to overcome the nation's cyber threats and challenges and to perform
effective oversight. Nevertheless, the implementation of our
recommendation to fully develop and execute a comprehensive national
cyber strategy remains more urgent than ever to ensure that there is a
clear roadmap for overcoming the cyber challenges facing our nation,
including its critical infrastructure.
Federal Government Needs to Strengthen Its Role in Protecting the
Cybersecurity of Critical Infrastructure
The federal government has been challenged in working with the
private sector to protect cyber critical infrastructure. We have made
recommendations aimed at strengthening the federal role in critical
infrastructure cybersecurity, including by (1) enhancing the
capabilities and services of DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency and (2) ensuring that federal agencies with sector-
specific responsibilities are providing their sector partners with
effective guidance and support.
DHS Needs to Complete CISA Transformation Activities to Better Support
Critical Infrastructure Owners and Operators
The importance of clear cybersecurity leadership extends beyond the
White House to other key executive branch agencies, including DHS.
Federal legislation enacted in November 2018 established CISA within
the department to advance the mission of protecting federal civilian
agencies' networks from cyber threats and to enhance the security of
the nation's critical infrastructure in the face of both physical and
cyber threats. The act elevated CISA to agency status; prescribed
changes to its structure, including mandating that it have separate
divisions on cybersecurity, infrastructure security, and emergency
communications; and assigned specific responsibilities to the
agency.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\24\ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018,
Pub. L. No. 115-278, Sec.  2,132 Stat. 4168, 4169, (Nov. 16,
2018)(codified at 6 U.S.C. Sec. 652). The act renamed the DHS National
Protection and Programs Directorate as CISA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To implement the statutory requirements, CISA leadership launched
an organizational transformation initiative. In March 2021, we reported
that while CISA had completed the first two of the three phases of its
organizational transformation initiative.\25\ Specifically, we noted
DHS had not fully implemented its phase three transformation, which
included finalizing the agency's mission-essential functions and
completing workforce-planning activities, that was intended to be
completed by December 2020.

Needed to Ensure Organizational Changes Result in More Effective
Cybersecurity for Our Nation, GAO-21-236 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 10,
2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We also reported that of 10 selected key practices for effective
agency reforms we previously identified, CISA's organizational
transformation generally addressed four, partially addressed five, and
did not address one. Further, we reported on a number of challenges
that selected government and private-sector stakeholders had noted when
coordinating with CISA, including a lack of clarity surrounding its
organizational changes and the lack of stakeholder involvement in
developing guidance. Although CISA had activities under way to mitigate
some of these challenges, it had not developed strategies to, among
other things, clarify changes to its organizational structure. Figure 2
below describes the coordination challenges identified by private-
sector stakeholders.

Coordination Challenges Reported by Stakeholders Representing the 16
Critical Infrastructure Sectors
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Source: GAO analysis of stakeholder interviews. GAO-22-105530

To address these weaknesses, we made 11 recommendations to DHS. The
department concurred with our recommendations and, as of September
2021, reported that it intends to fully implement them by the end of
calendar year 2022. Implementing these recommendations will better
position CISA to ensure the success of its reorganization efforts and
carry out its mission to lead national efforts to identify and respond
to cyber and other risks to our nation's infrastructure.
Sector Risk Management Agencies Need to Ensure Effective Guidance and
Support of Critical Infrastructure Owners and Operators
Since 2010, we have made about 80 recommendations for various
federal agencies to enhance infrastructure cybersecurity. For example,
in February 2020, we recommended that agencies better measure the
adoption of the NIST framework of voluntary cyber standards and correct
sector-specific weaknesses. Specifically, we reported that most sector
lead agencies--known as sector risk management agencies \26\--were not
collecting and reporting on improvements in the protection of critical
infrastructure as a result of using the framework across the
sectors.\27\ We concluded that collecting and reporting on these
improvements would help the sectors understand the extent to which
sectors are better protecting their critical infrastructure from cyber
threats.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\26\ Sector-specific agencies was a term formally used to describe
the nine agencies that have a lead role in protecting the 16 critical
infrastructure sectors. Pursuant to the William M. (Mac) Thornberry
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, Pub. L. No.
116-283, Sec.  9002, any reference to sector-specific agencies in any
law, regulation, document, or other paper of the United States shall be
deemed a reference to the sector risk management agency of the relevant
critical infrastructure sector.
\27\ GAO, Critical Infrastructure Protection: Additional Actions
Needed to Identify Framework Adoption and Resulting Improvements, GAO-
20-299 (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 9, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To address these issues, we made 10 recommendations--one to NIST on
establishing time frames for completing selected programs--and nine to
the lead agencies, to collect and report on improvements gained from
using the framework. Eight agencies agreed with the recommendations,
while one neither agreed nor disagreed and one partially agreed.
However, as of November 2021, none of the recommendations had been
implemented. Until the lead agencies collect and report on improvements
gained from adopting the framework, the extent to which the 16 critical
infrastructure sectors are better protecting their critical
infrastructure from threats will be largely unknown.
We have also frequently reported on the need for lead agencies to
enhance the cybersecurity of their related critical infrastructure
sectors and subsectors--such as transportation systems, communications,
energy, education, and financial services.\28\

Aviation.\29\ The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
is responsible for overseeing the safety of commercial aviation,
including avionics systems. The growing connectivity between airplanes
and these systems may present increasing opportunities for cyberattacks
on commercial planes. In October 2020, we reported that FAA had
established a process for certification and oversight of U.S.
commercial airplanes, including their operations.\30\ However, FAA had
not prioritized risk-based cybersecurity oversight or included periodic
testing as part of its monitoring process, among other things. To
address these and other related issues, we made six recommendations to
FAA; however, as of November 2021, the agency had not implemented the
recommendations.

subsectors, including aviation.

Mass Transit and Passenger Rail.\31\ Recent physical and
cyberattacks on rail systems in U.S. and foreign cities highlight the
importance of strengthening and securing passenger rail systems around
the world. TSA is the primary federal agency responsible for securing
transportation in the United States. To assess risk elements for
physical and cyber security in passenger rail, TSA utilizes various
risk assessments, including, among other things, the Baseline
Assessment for Security Enhancement (BASE).\32\ TSA uses these risk
assessments to evaluate threat, vulnerability, and consequence for
attack scenarios across various transportation modes. In April 2020, we
reported \33\ that while TSA had taken initial steps to share
cybersecurity key practices and other information with passenger rail
stakeholders, the BASE assessment did not fully reflect the updated
cybersecurity key practices presented in NIST's Cybersecurity
Framework,\34\ nor did it include the framework in a list of available
cyber resources.\35\ Our review of the BASE cybersecurity questions in
the template found that they covered selected activities associated
with three of the five functions outlined in the framework--Identify,
Protect, and Respond. However, the remaining two functions--Detect and
Recover--were not represented in the BASE. We made two recommendations
to TSA, including that the agency update the BASE cybersecurity
questions to ensure they reflect key practices. DHS agreed with our
recommendations. As of November 2021, one recommendation had not been
implemented.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\31\ The transportation systems sector consists of seven key
subsectors, including mass transit and passenger rail.
\32\ The BASE is a voluntary security assessment of national mass
transit, passenger rail, and highway systems conducted by TSA surface
transportation inspectors that addresses potential vulnerabilities,
among other things. The BASE is a nonregulatory security assessment,
which requires surface transportation entities' voluntary
participation. It consists of an assessment template with 17 security
action items developed by TSA and the Federal Transit Administration
that address, among other best practices, security training programs,
risk information sharing, and cybersecurity. TSA developed this
assessment in 2006 to increase domain awareness, enhance prevention and
protection capabilities, and further response preparedness of passenger
transit systems nationwide.

Exercise Program, and through regional cybersecurity workshops

cybersecurity key practices through questions in the BASE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pipeline Systems.\36\ The nation depends on the
interstate pipeline system to deliver critical resources such as oil
and natural gas. This increasingly computerized system is an attractive
target for hackers and terrorists. In December 2018, we found
weaknesses in the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA)
management of its pipeline security efforts.\37\ We reported that TSA,
a component agency of DHS, had issued revised pipeline security
guidelines; however, the revisions did not include all elements from
the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and did not include clear definitions
to ensure the identification of critical facilities by pipeline
operators.\38\ We also reported that the agency had conducted pipeline
security reviews to assess pipeline systems vulnerabilities; however,
the quantity of TSA's reviews of corporate and critical facilities
security had varied considerably. To address these and other issues we
made 10 recommendations to TSA. The agency agreed with all of our
recommendations. In July 2021, we testified that the TSA had not fully
addressed pipeline cybersecurity-related weaknesses that GAO had
previously identified, such as aged protocols for responding to
pipeline security incidents.\39\ As of November 2021, TSA had
implemented 10 of the 13 recommendations from 2018 and 2019 and had not
implemented three.

Communications. The Communications sector is an integral
component of the U.S. economy and faces serious cyber-related threats
that could affect the operations of local, regional, and national level
networks. In November 2021, we reported that CISA has a leadership role
in coordinating federal efforts intended to aid in the resilience of
the Communications Sector.\40\ The agency fulfills its responsibilities
to private sector owners and operators through a variety of programs
and services, including incident management and information sharing. We
found CISA had not assessed the effectiveness of these activities, nor
updated a strategic sector guidance document, despite being recommended
by DHS to do so every 4 years. Specifically, the current plan, from
2015, lacks information on new and emerging threats to the
Communications Sector, such as security threats to the communications
technology supply chain. Developing and issuing updated guidance would
enable CISA to set goals, objectives, and priorities that address
threats and risks to the sector, and help meet its sector risk
management agency responsibilities. As such, we made three
recommendations to CISA, including that the agency assess the
effectiveness of support provided to sector, and revise the sector plan
to include, among other things, new and emerging threats and risks. DHS
concurred with the recommendations and described initial actions under
way or planned to address them in a 2021 letter in response to our
report.

Energy. The U.S. grid's distributing systems--which carry
electricity from transmission systems to consumers and are regulated
primarily by states--are increasingly at risk from cyberattacks. In
August 2019, we reported that the electric grid faced various
cybersecurity risks.\41\ We noted that the Department of Energy (DOE)
had developed plans and an assessment to address the risks. However,
these documents did not fully address all of the key characteristics of
a national strategy. Subsequently, in March 2021, we reported that the
electric grid's distribution systems continued to face various
cybersecurity risks.\42\ DOE had developed plans and an assessment to
address the risks to the electric grid; however, these documents did
not fully address risks to the grid's distribution systems. To mitigate
this issue, we recommended that the department more fully address cyber
risks to the grid's distribution systems in its plans to implement the
national cybersecurity strategy for the grid. DOE agreed with our
recommendation; however, as of November 2021, the department had not
implemented our recommendation.

Education. When the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure
of schools across the nation, many kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12)
schools moved from in-person to remote education, increasing their
dependence on IT and making them potentially more vulnerable to
cyberattacks. In October 2021, we reported that the Department of
Education's sector-specific plan for the Education Facilities subsector
had not been updated since 2010 and did not reflect substantially
changed cybersecurity risks affecting K-12 schools.\43\ Further,
Education had not determined whether sector-specific guidance was
needed for K-12 schools to help protect against cyber threats,
including against the increasing threat of ransomware attacks. To
address these issues, we recommended that Education initiate a meeting
with CISA to determine how to update its sector-specific plan and
determine whether sector-specific guidance is needed. Education
concurred with GAO's recommendations and described actions that it
would take to address them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Financial Services. The federal government has long
identified the financial services sector as a critical component of the
nation's infrastructure. In September 2020, we reported that the
Department of the Treasury and other federal agencies were taking steps
to reduce risks and bolster the financial sector's efforts to improve
its cybersecurity.\44\ However, Treasury had not worked with other
federal agencies and sector partners to better measure progress and to
prioritize efforts in line with sector cybersecurity goals laid out in
the implementation plan of the 2018 National Cyber Strategy. To address
these issues, we made two recommendations to Treasury. The department
agreed with our recommendations; however, as of November 2021, Treasury
had not implemented the recommendations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\44\ GAO, Critical Infrastructure Protection: Treasury Needs to
Improve Tracking of Financial Sector Cybersecurity Risk Mitigation
Efforts, GAO-20-631 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 17, 2020).

Overall, federal agencies have not addressed most of our
recommendations related to protecting critical infrastructure.\45\
About 50 of the about 80 recommendations made in our public reports
since 2010 have not been implemented, as of November 2021. We also
designated 14 of these as priority recommendations; as of November
2021, 11 had not been implemented. Until our recommendations are fully
addressed, federal agencies will not be effectively positioned to
ensure critical infrastructure sectors are adequately protected from
potentially harmful cybersecurity threats.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\45\ GAO-21-288.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In summary, the federal government needs to move with a greater
sense of urgency in response to the serious cybersecurity threats faced
by the nation and its critical infrastructure. This would include
developing and executing a comprehensive national strategy and
strengthening the federal role in protecting the cybersecurity of
critical infrastructure. Without implementing our recommendations, the
federal government will continue to be hindered in its ability to
provide effective support to the cybersecurity of the nation's critical
infrastructure. As a result, the risk of unprotected infrastructure
being harmed is heightened.
Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and Members of the
Committee, this completes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to
respond to any questions that you may have.

Mr. DeFazio. Thank you for your testimony. I will try and
squeak out a couple of questions here.
Mr. Grossman, what are--briefly--let's say, the top three
cybersecurity challenges at the FAA?
And what are you doing to quickly implement measures to
mitigate this?
Mr. Grossman. Thank you for your question, Chairman
DeFazio.
The FAA operates a large, complex infrastructure of
interconnected networks and services. We have many service
providers. Connectivity includes satellite-based
communications, automated communications between aircraft, et
cetera. The system has become very, very complex.
Most of our challenges really are around the purpose-built,
legacy nav systems that are in operation today. These systems
are operated 24/7/365, they require extensive testing, and
operate custom-built software. Really, they don't allow remote
patching capabilities. So, keeping up with the cyber hygiene
component is a fairly large challenge from an FAA air traffic
control perspective.
We protect that system, though, through compensating
controls, meaning that network, while it is very difficult to
patch and update, is very difficult to attach to, as well. It
doesn't have internet access. There is a very mature access
control list. In other words, system A can only speak to system
B over very specific ports, with very specific protocols, and
everything else is not addressed.
Additionally, we----
Mr. DeFazio. One more----
Mr. Grossman. OK, sir.
Mr. DeFazio. Mr. Dorsey, you were pretty critical, I
thought. Do you agree with Mr. Grossman's assessment on the top
challenges, and why do you think they aren't yet rectified?
Mr. Dorsey. Thank you for your question, Chairman DeFazio.
I think the three key top challenges for the Department
are: to solidify leadership at the chief information security
officer level to provide the needed leadership, oversight, and
accountability necessary for agencywide improvements to address
ongoing information security weaknesses; two, I think the
Department needs to develop a comprehensive, DOT-wide
cybersecurity strategy to address recurring weaknesses; and
three, they need to better protect and secure its IT
infrastructure and sensitive information from potential
compromises.
Those are the three key areas I believe that the Department
needs to focus on to address the weaknesses that we have
identified over the last 10 years.
Mr. DeFazio. So, Mr. Grossman, are those things in
progress?
Mr. Grossman. Well, I am the chief information security
officer for the FAA, so there is leadership within FAA, and we
are working with the OIG to close these audit recommendations.
We believe that we have protections in place. While many of
the compliance-type audits have a lot of findings, the actual
vulnerabilities are, in our opinion, most of them are mitigated
through compensating controls.
Mr. DeFazio. OK, all right.
Mr. Dorsey. Sir----
Mr. DeFazio. I have exhausted my time----
Mr. Dorsey. Sir?
Mr. DeFazio. OK, briefly.
Mr. Dorsey. Sir, when I was speaking----
Mr. DeFazio. Sure.
Mr. Dorsey. Sir, when I was speaking of the chief
information officer, chief information security officer, I was
speaking about at the Department level. They are responsible
for providing oversight of all of the OAs, including FAA. Thank
you.
Mr. DeFazio. So, you are saying at DOT, [inaudible] FAA and
other agencies?
Mr. Dorsey. Yes, sir. Thank you.
Mr. DeFazio. And there is no one in that position right
now?
Mr. Dorsey. There is no permanent chief information
security officer at the Department level at this time.
Mr. DeFazio. OK.
Mr. Dorsey. When we were conducting our reviews last year,
there was a--he was serving as the acting chief information
security officer.
Mr. DeFazio. OK, all right. Well, thank you. I am going to
yield now to Ranking Member Graves, because he can ask
questions better with a voice than I can. Thank you.
Mr. Crawford. All right, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As a committee, we continue to hear conflicting reports
from TSA and pipeline industry stakeholders regarding the
process and engagements throughout the issuance of two TSA
security directives.
Furthermore, myself and Ranking Member Graves, as well as
Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs
Ranking Member Portman, sent letters to DHS OIG to review the
process in which TSA and CISA drafted the directives, which I
ask unanimous consent to be entered into the record, Mr.
Chairman.
Mr. DeFazio. Without objection.

Dear Inspector General Cuffari:
We write to request a review of the Transportation Security
Agency's (TSA's) use of emergency security directives in coordination
with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) for
the transportation and infrastructure sectors.
On May 27, 2021, TSA Administrator David Pekoske exercised
emergency authority following the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack
and issued a security directive mandating certain pipeline operators to
take actions to strengthen their cybersecurity measures.\1\ On July 20,
2021, TSA issued a second pipeline-focused security directive outlining
further mandatory steps required of pipeline operators.\2\
Unfortunately, we have learned that these security directives were
likely established with little communication or input from relevant
stakeholders, would require burdensome reporting, and their
prescriptive requirements could potentially interfere with safe
pipeline operations and existing cybersecurity measures.\3\ On August
24, 2021, several associations representing pipeline operators affected
by the new security directives wrote to TSA outlining these concerns
with the directives and urged TSA to share threat information so
operators can better defend against potential cyber threats.\4\

Alejandro Mayorkas announced TSA would issue additional security
directives on cybersecurity for railroads and rail transit, as well as
further mandatory requirements for aviation.\5\ Stakeholders have also
expressed serious concerns with the development and potential
implementation of any forthcoming directives, citing the stringent
timeframes for reporting, high costs for compliance, and the extensive
amount of information to be reported, which may obscure true cyber
threats.\6\

We must protect our Nation's critical transportation and
infrastructure assets against cyber-attacks and intrusions from
malicious actors. The consequences of failing to do so could lead to
negative impacts on the operability and reliability of our most
essential transportation and infrastructure assets and subsequently
affect safety, business operations, and the economies that rely upon
them.\7\ However, in doing so, we must ensure that efforts to secure
our transportation and infrastructure are done in a collaborative
manner with private industry and relevant stakeholders and do not
impose regulatory burdens that interfere with ongoing cybersecurity
efforts.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given this, we are concerned that the recently issued and
forthcoming security directives from TSA on cybersecurity in the
transportation and infrastructure sectors do not follow these critical
principles. To address these concerns, we request a review of TSA's
development and issuance of security directives or emergency amendments
this year. In particular, we request that you examine the following in
regards each security directive or emergency amendment related to
cybersecurity issued or in development this year:
1.  The basis for the directive or amendment and, in each case, the
basis for employing the emergency authority under section 114(l)(2) of
title 49, United States Code, to issue those directives without full
notice and comment, including:
a.  Any consultation with the Office of the Secretary of Homeland
Security or the Executive Office of the President;
b.  TSA's identification of imminent, elevated, or additional
specific threats to infrastructure and operations of pipelines,
railroads, rail transit systems, and the aviation sector; and
c.  The timing and public announcements of the directives
including those announced by the Secretary for railroads, rail transit
agencies, and the aviation sector on October 6, 2021;
2.  The consultation process with stakeholders in each case,
including industry, other federal agencies, and Congress, which should
examine:
a.  The timelines accorded for affected industries to provide
feedback;
b.  The extent to which TSA modified the content of the draft
security directives to address industry comments or concerns raised by
stakeholders in the pipeline, railroad, rail transit, and aviation
industries ; and
c.  The Federal agencies that contributed to the development of
these security directives and their involvement, including the
Department of Transportation, and any modifications to the content of
the draft security directives to address any comments or concerns;
3.  The basis for designating of all or parts of the draft and
final security directives and related documents as Sensitive Security
Information (SSI) and the non-designation of the final SD-01 as SSI
including:
a.  Whether the SSI designation was used to restrict access for
any reason other than those authorized by law;
b.  The basis for designating information as SSI in a draft but
not a final security directive; and
c.  The specific information designated as SSI in each draft or
final security directive and why such a designation was made;
4.  Whether CISA has statutory authority to order private sector
entities to report cybersecurity incidences, including those contained
in the Security Directives, to the agency; should examine:
a.  The history of TSA using its statutory authority to require
reporting by private sector entities to other agencies of the
government.
5.  The workforce capacity at TSA or CISA to develop and implement
security directives for the transportation and infrastructure sectors,
including:
a.  The number of full-time employees dedicated to development
and implementation of the security directives;
b.  The number of staff with expertise in the industrial, safety,
or cybersecurity operations of the pipeline, railroads, rail transit,
and aviation industries; and
c.  Any use of other federal agencies or federal government
contractors to develop or implement the security directives.

We request that you review this matter and submit a report to us
within 120 days. In the interim, we request that you provide us with
regular updates. Thank you for your attention to this matter. If you
have questions, please contact Melissa Beaumont, with the Minority
Staff of the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous
Materials [phone number redacted].

Letter of October 28, 2021, to Hon. Joseph V. Cuffari, Inspector
General, Department of Homeland Security, from Senator Rob Portman,
Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental
Affairs et al., Submitted for the Record by Hon. Eric A. ``Rick''
Crawford
United States Senate,
Washington, DC,
October 28, 2021.
The Honorable Joseph V. Cuffari,
Inspector General,
Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Inspector General,
Washington, DC 20528-0305.
Dear Mr. Cuffari:
We write to request you review the process by which the
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has developed and issued
several emergency security directives this year, including recently
issued and announced cybersecurity directives developed in consultation
with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
Our critical infrastructure must be secured and protected against
cyberattacks. However, securing critical infrastructure requires a
collaborative approach with the experts in these industries--the people
who operate this critical infrastructure and who are charged with
implementing these directives. We believe that care must be taken to
avoid unnecessarily burdensome requirements that shift resources away
from responding to cyberattacks to regulatory compliance.
Unfortunately, we have received reports that TSA and CISA failed to
give adequate consideration to feedback from stakeholders and subject
matter experts who work in these fields and that the requirements are
too inflexible. We are also troubled that TSA and the DHS Office of
Legislative Affairs (DHS OLA) refused to provide copies of the draft
directives to Congress, including the Chairs and Ranking Members of its
congressional oversight committees, despite having shared copies with
the pipeline industry.
The TSA Administrator has the statutory authority to issue security
regulations in the transportation sector. Under a related authority,
which had never before been exercised with the pipeline sector, the
Administrator may issue emergency security regulations or directives
without notice and comment if the Administrator determines that it
``must be issued immediately in order to protect transportation
security.'' \1\ At least until earlier this year, TSA had worked in
close coordination with industry stakeholders to develop practical
security guidelines and policies.\2\

We are concerned that the recently issued security directives
appear to depart from TSA's historically collaborative relationship
with industry experts. On May 27, 2021, in response to the Colonial
Pipeline ransomware attack, TSA Administrator David Pekoske exercised
the emergency security directive authority and issued TSA's first ever
pipeline-focused security directive (SD-01).\3\ On July 20th, TSA
issued a second security directive to the pipeline industry entitled,
``Security Directive Pipeline--2021-02: Pipeline Cybersecurity
Mitigation Actions, Contingency Planning, and Testing'' (SD-02).\4\ In
response, on August 24, 2021, associations representing more than 2,700
companies in the oil and natural gas subsector sent a letter to TSA
Administrator Pekoske warning of inadequate consultation and that the
resulting security directives could have ``operational safety and
reliability'' impacts.\5\

Another area of concern is that TSA and the DHS OLA also refused to
provide copies of the draft directives to Congress, including the
Chairs and Ranking Members of its congressional oversight committees,
despite having shared copies of the drafts with the pipeline industry.
In a briefing with Senate staff on July 15, 2021, TSA officials
explained they would not be providing a draft of SD-02 to Senate staff
because it was pre-decisional and therefore deliberative.\8\ This
argument appears to misapprehend the function and limits of the
deliberative process privilege, which is not a bar to disclosure,
especially not to Congress, and in any event is generally considered
waived once an agency has ``officially acknowledged'' the record by
prior disclosure outside the Government, as here.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ Briefing with HSGAC Staff (Jul. 15, 2021) (notes on file with
Committee).
\9\ See, e.g., Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755, 765 (1990).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We agree that critical infrastructure must be protected against
cyber-attacks, particularly in the wake of the Colonial Pipeline
ransomware attack, but the process by which TSA has issued these
directives raises concerns. To address these concerns, we request that
you review TSA's development and issuance of emergency security
directives this year. Specifically, we request that you examine the
following with regard to each emergency security directive or emergency
amendment related to cybersecurity issued this year:
1.  The basis for the directive or amendment and, in each case, the
basis for employing the emergency authority under section 114(l)(2) of
title 49, United States Code, to issue those directives without full
notice and comment, including:
a.  Any consultation with the Office of the Secretary of Homeland
Security or the Executive Office of the President;
b.  TSA's identification of additional threats to pipeline
critical infrastructure, rail transit systems, and the aviation sector;
and
c.  The timing of the directives and announcements of the
directives including those announced on October 6;
2.  The consultation process with stakeholders in each case,
including industry, other agencies, and Congress, which should examine:
a.  The timeline for affected industries to provide feedback;
b.  The extent to which TSA modified draft security directives to
address industry comments or concerns; and
c.  The Federal agencies who contributed to the development of
these security directives and their involvement;
3.  The basis for designating of all or parts of the draft and
final security directives and related documents as Sensitive Security
Information (SSI) and the non-designation of the final SD-01 as SSI
including:
a.  Whether the SSI designation was used to restrict access for
any reason other than those reasons authorized by law;
b.  The basis for designating information as SSI in a draft but
not a final security directive; and
c.  The specific information designated as SSI in each draft or
final security directive and why such a designation was made; and
4.  The basis for withholding the draft directives from Congress.

We request that you review this matter and submit a report to us
within 120 days. In the interim, we request that you provide us with
monthly updates. Thank you for your prompt attention to this important
request.
Sincerely,
Rob Portman,
Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental
Affairs.

August 24, 2021.
The Honorable David P. Pekoske,
Administrator,
Transportation Security Administration, 601 South 12th Street,
Arlington, VA 20598-6020.
Administrator Pekoske,
The included pipeline trade associations, AFPM, AGA, AOPL, API,
APGA, INGAA, and GPA Midstream appreciate the opportunity to provide
feedback on the recent Security Directive 2021-02, issued on July 19,
2021 (Directive). These trade associations represent almost all aspects
of U.S. energy pipeline operations that serve customers reliably across
North America. The associations' members represent refineries and
petrochemical operators--through which pipelines receive and distribute
products, regional and local natural gas distribution pipelines,
liquids pipelines, integrated and midstream natural gas and oil
companies, operators of municipal natural gas systems, natural gas
transmission pipelines, and natural gas product pipelines and
processors. Across the industry, our members all share the same
concerns with the implementation of Security Directive 2021-02 and the
process with which it was developed. For nearly two decades, we have
worked along-side TSA in a structured oversight model applying risk-
based methodology that properly balanced pipeline security with
operational reliability and safety. We understand the ongoing situation
presented by ransomware and other cyber threats to critical
infrastructure and are committed to working with TSA to continue sound
pipeline security practices and policies.
Open communication, process transparency, and timely engagement
with the industry have been hallmarks of the TSA pipeline security
program. Concerningly, these fundamental elements of a strong security
partnership were not fully realized during the process used to develop
the Directive. We wish to reemphasize the need for TSA to work
efficiently with affected companies on successful Directive
implementation, especially now that compliance deadlines are
approaching. We encourage TSA and its technical experts to work closely
with industry experts to ensure mutual understanding of how
requirements in the Directive could impact operational reliability.
While we appreciate that TSA published an initial list of
frequently asked questions (FAQs) focused on administrative matters,
there remain several unanswered technical questions submitted by the
associations and our members to which TSA guidance is critical for
compliance. These unanswered questions have left operators with
significant uncertainty about what is required for compliance. We urge
TSA to release the technical FAQs in a timelier manner--TSA's timeline
to responding to questions should be consistent with the rapid
deadlines established under the Directive. We also ask TSA to apply
learnings from the recent Directive development process to improve the
agency's procedures for obtaining stakeholder input on future pipeline
security initiatives and avoid recreating the implementation challenges
and uncertainty our members are now experiencing.
Operational reliability and safety are extremely important to the
pipeline industry. The Directive's potential to cause operational
disruptions or threaten safe operations remains a concern of affected
pipeline operators. Our pipeline operators have expert knowledge
regarding their assets, how they are managed to meet customer needs,
and how to comply with the various state and federal regulations under
which they are required to operate. As the Directive was developed,
industry conveyed highly probable operational safety and reliability
concerns that could arise by imposing prescriptive cyber requirements
and untenable timelines without specific understanding of a company's
existing cybersecurity protections and operations. We appreciate that
TSA addressed some of our recommendations and responded to our
feedback. Regretfully, significant concerns remain. The broad scope and
prescriptive nature of the Directive create potential conflicts with
TSA pipeline Security Guidelines and with existing cybersecurity and
safety regulations from other federal government entities. The
prescribed implementation schedule creates safety and reliability
concerns. We urge TSA to work closely and quickly with operators on
Directive implementation to ensure affected pipelines do not have to
choose between complying with the Directive and ensuring continued
safety and reliable operations.
The Directive allows operators flexibility to submit alternative
compliance options to TSA for consideration, and TSA has stated it will
respond promptly to these submissions. We recognize TSA believes
operator concerns may be addressed through this alternative submittal
option. However, the usability of this option is limited without
further clarity on TSA's anticipated criteria and timelines for review
of alternative proposals relative to the Directive's deadlines, what
recourse operators have if TSA disagrees with proposed alternative
compliance options, and how TSA will address scenarios where an
operator determines that extensive equipment retrofits will take longer
time periods than envisioned by TSA. Furthermore, TSA should ensure
operators are not penalized for awaiting TSA's clarification of these
issues and approval of alternative proposals as the Directive's
deadlines approach. Pipeline operators also face challenges applying
the Directive in the context of broader corporate structures, given
that cybersecurity for some pipeline operations is managed across
individual companies and countries as part of enterprise-level
cybersecurity and information technology systems that also cover non-
pipeline operations. As the Directive is currently written, and without
clarity from TSA, some operators are in the position of guessing what
nonoperational networks (e.g., finance, HR, etc.) are impacted by the
Directive and may be applying prescriptive measures that divert
resources while not addressing the actual risks to pipeline operations.
We urge TSA to provide more clarity on the scope, so that operators can
make more sound determinations of what is necessary to avoid disrupting
operations or threatening pipeline safety.
We also urge TSA to reconsider its process for implementing
pipeline security initiatives in the future to ensure better input on
the compatibility of proposed security requirements with pipeline
operational technology. It is important TSA make timely updates to its
pipeline security policies to keep up with evolving threats. At the
same time, it is equally important TSA's process does not sacrifice
input from the regulated industry for the sake of speed. TSA's
authorizing statute \1\ and the Administrative Procedures Act require
that the agency use formal notice-and-comment rulemaking as the primary
vehicle for issuing new requirements. In this case, we believe the
robust stakeholder input and advisory committee review provided by a
notice-and-comment rulemaking would have resolved many of the
substantive challenges created by the current Directive text and
promoted stronger public-private partnership for pipeline security. We
acknowledge that TSA may wish to protect certain aspects of its
proposed requirements as Sensitive Security Information and note that
procedures other than formal notice-and-comment can also be successful
in soliciting and incorporating necessary input on a timely basis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ 49 U.S.C. Sec.  114(l)(2)(A).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our associations are also concerned that, as you testified to the
Senate Commerce Committee on July 27, 2021, there is additional threat
information driving the urgency of the Directive and the timelines that
have been set. This threat intelligence has not been shared with
potentially affected companies. Pipeline operators are best positioned
to design mitigations to defend their systems against new threats based
on their risk-based security programs. They are unable to effectively
prepare for threats about which they have not been briefed. While we do
appreciate the recent offer of a Secret level briefing to a limited
group of associations within the Beltway, we again highlight the need
for TSA, and the broader intelligence community, to ensure they are
sharing the most timely and relevant information directly with the
potentially impacted operators. We urge TSA, and other agencies that
have threat information relevant to pipelines, to brief all potentially
affected companies as soon as possible to ensure they can appropriately
defend against current threats. We also encourage TSA to work with the
broader intelligence community (IC) to provide regularly scheduled
briefings to pipeline industry experts to ensure operators are
appropriately informed about the evolving threats to their systems. TSA
should also work with the IC to provide as much timely, unclassified
information as possible to operators to ensure it is actionable and can
be disseminated to operators who do not possess security clearances.
Listed below is a summary of our requests.

TSA and its technical experts should work closely and
quickly with industry experts to ensure mutual understanding of how
requirements in the Directive could impact operational safety and
reliability.

TSA should release the technical FAQs immediately.

TSA should provide clarity on anticipated criteria and
timelines for review of alternative proposals, including addressing
operator recourse if TSA disagrees with the alternative proposal and
how TSA will address supply chain limitations.

TSA should ensure operators are not penalized for
awaiting TSA's review of alternative proposals.

TSA should provide more clarity on the Directive's scope
so that operators can make more sound determinations of what is
necessary to avoid disrupting operations or threatening pipeline
safety.

TSA should reconsider its process for implementing
pipeline security initiatives in the future to ensure better input on
the compatibility of proposed security requirements with pipeline
operational technology.

TSA and pertinent government intelligence community
should brief all potentially affected pipelines on relevant
cybersecurity threat intelligence as soon as possible.

The associations and our members are committed to supporting
efforts to build pipeline cyber security capability, and we look
forward to further discussing our concerns and potential solutions to
ensure the Directive implementation can be successful.

Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I would just like to--to Ms. Newhouse, how would TSA
evaluate implementation of the pipeline security directives?
Ms. Newhouse. Thank you for your question, Congressman
Crawford.
We continue extensive, extensive engagement. That is the
hallmark of what we are doing in order to ensure continuous
improvement. We have actually developed and implemented an
entire field surface operational structure to do this. So, we
have boots on the ground.
And what we have been finding, thus far, we--as you
mentioned, sir, we have issued two security directives this
summer, post-Colonial Pipeline. We are proud to announce, on
behalf of us and our stakeholders, that all stakeholders that
are subject to that directive have met all of the requirements
in the very first security directive. It was very tight
guidelines, communicated beautifully with us, very vocal, and,
frankly, very direct with us when they met challenges.
We are now in the process----
Mr. Crawford. Let me ask you about those challenges, if I
could. What challenges have you identified during
implementation?
Ms. Newhouse. Well, I think the biggest one--and we have
actually taken this to heart--is the definition of a reportable
cybersecurity incident. And we have taken steps and a great
deal of feedback to modify that definition to not include all
potential incidents.
Mr. Crawford. OK.
Ms. Newhouse. We have narrowed that, and focused that,
based on industry feedback.
Mr. Crawford. Excellent. Recently, the oil and natural gas
pipeline trade associations jointly requested TSA conduct an
advance notice of proposed rulemaking to gather information
vital to drafting a proposed regulation to replace the expiring
security directives.
I ask unanimous consent for this letter to be entered into
the record, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. DeFazio. Without objection.

Letter of November 22, 2021, to Hon. David P. Pekoske, Administrator,
Transportation Security Administration, from American Fuel and
Petrochemical Manufacturers et al., Submitted for the Record by Hon.
Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers,
American Gas Association,
Association of Oil Pipe Lines,
American Petroleum Institute,
American Public Gas Association,
Interstate Natural Gas Association of America,
GPA Midstream Association,
November 22, 2021.
The Honorable David P. Pekoske,
Administrator,
Transportation Security Administration, 6595 Springfield Center Drive,
Springfield, VA 22150.
Administrator Pekoske,
The included pipeline trade associations, AFPM, AGA, AOPL, API,
APGA, INGAA, and GPA Midstream appreciate the opportunity to engage
with TSA in the next phase of pipeline cybersecurity regulations. These
trade associations represent almost all aspects of U.S. energy pipeline
operations that serve customers reliably across North America. The
associations' members represent refineries and petrochemical
operators--through which pipelines receive and distribute products,
regional and local natural gas distribution pipelines, liquids
pipelines, integrated and midstream natural gas and oil companies,
operators of municipal natural gas systems, natural gas transmission
pipelines, and natural gas product pipelines and processors.
Across the industry, our members all share the same concerns
regarding TSA's development of pipeline cybersecurity regulations. Both
pipeline Security Directives \1\ are slated to sunset in May and July
2022, respectively. Based on conversations with you and the TSA Surface
Operations and Policy sections, we understand TSA intends to pursue
formal rulemaking for pipeline cybersecurity to replace the Security
Directives. Your remarks to our associations and members this Fall
regarding collaboration and process transparency around future
rulemaking were well-received. Notably, you welcomed the opportunity
for pre-rulemaking meetings with stakeholders and underscored TSA's
intention to have a robust, thoughtful comment period for each phase of
the rulemaking process.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Security Directive Pipeline 2021-01 issued on May 28, 2021 and
Security Directive Pipeline 2021-02 issued on July 19, 2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In light of this, we strongly urge TSA to issue an Advanced Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) well in advance of the sunset dates for
the Security Directives. Further, given the rule will likely affect a
broader range of companies than presently impacted by the Security
Directives, an ANPRM is appropriate for obtaining input from the
additional potentially impacted entities.
TSA can leverage the ANPRM formal process to receive feedback from
industry and public stakeholders on risk-based pipeline cybersecurity
regulations and responses to questions that promote a greater
understanding of what are reasonable, applicable, auditable, and
sustainable regulations. For example, central questions TSA should
address as part of pipeline cybersecurity development include:
1.  What types of cybersecurity risks are most threatening to
operating a pipeline safely and without interruption?
2.  How can TSA design a cybersecurity regulatory program to best
address the risks faced by pipeline operators?
3.  What factors should TSA consider to ensure cybersecurity
regulatory requirements do not disrupt or impair pipeline operations or
safety systems?
4.  How should TSA design a cybersecurity regulatory program so
that it is able to evolve with the risks and tactics of cybercriminals?

By following the approach of other federal government agencies and
asking a series of questions on the subject matter, TSA can develop,
issue, and receive ANPRM comments on a short timeline. To the extent
TSA questions whether an ANPRM would add additional time to the
rulemaking process, our trade associations pledge to respond to an
ANPRM in a timely manner.
Operational reliability and safety are important to the pipeline
industry. We are committed to supporting efforts to advance pipeline
cybersecurity capability. Our associations and members have the
technical expertise to inform such regulations so that prescribed
actions do not compromise reliability and safety, nor conflict with
existing cybersecurity regulations. We look forward to working with TSA
on regulation development.

Mr. Crawford. Thank you, sir. I hate to keep bothering you
with that, I know your throat is killing you.
As they stated, TSA can leverage the ANPRM informal process
to promote a greater understanding of what are reasonable,
applicable, auditable, and sustainable regulations.
Will TSA issue an ANPRM to gather this important
information?
Ms. Newhouse. Thank you for your question, Congressman.
We are considering all of our options, including the most
transparent options. An ANPRM, or advanced notice of proposed
rulemaking, is one tool that we have exercised in the past
successfully. And as we have continued robust engagement both
at the classified and unclassified level with all of our
surface transportation stakeholders, in particular our
pipeline, rail, freight rail, passenger rail, and aviation
stakeholders, we are considering all of those options. So yes,
sir, that is on the table.
Mr. Crawford. As you know, we are anticipating the release
of a new security directive for rail. It should be as early as
this afternoon, if I understand correctly.
Unfortunately, we have heard concerns about the development
of these directives from stakeholders, including from the
freight rail industry, at our previous hearing on
cybersecurity, and in a November 4th letter from the American
Public Transportation Association, which I also ask unanimous
consent to be entered into the record.
I apologize for that inconvenience one more time, Mr.
Chairman.
Mr. DeFazio. Without objection.
[The information follows:]

Letter of November 4, 2021, to Hon. Peter A. DeFazio and Hon. Sam
Graves of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, from Paul
P. Skoutelas, President and CEO, American Public Transportation
Association, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
American Public Transportation Association,
1300 I Street NW, Suite 1200 East,
Washington, DC 20005,
November 4, 2021.
The Honorable Peter A. DeFazio,
Chairman,
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, 2165 Rayburn
House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Sam Graves,
Ranking Member,
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, 2164 Rayburn
House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves:
On behalf of the 1,500 member organizations of the American Public
Transportation Association (APTA), and in advance of the House
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's hearing on The
Evolving Cybersecurity Landscape: Industry Perspectives on Securing the
Nation's Infrastructure, I write to share our concerns on the
forthcoming Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Security
Directive for rail transit and passenger rail operations. On October 6,
2021, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas
announced that TSA is expected to impose cybersecurity mandates on
certain rail transit systems and railroads, including a stringent
incident reporting deadline and a short timeframe to develop and
implement response and contingency plans.
Specifically, APTA is concerned that TSA is imposing these new and
potentially costly requirements through an emergency security directive
without the benefit of public notice and comment, including an analysis
of the economic impact of the new requirements on rail transit and
passenger rail operators. For example, mandating a prescriptive 24-hour
reporting requirement in a security directive could negatively affect
cyber response and mitigation by diverting personnel and resources to
reporting when incident response is most critical. Further, the
additional personnel and resources needed to comply with the
requirements will add significant compliance costs just as transit
agencies are working to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. TSA has
previously employed the federal rulemaking process for other security
requirements on surface transportation systems, including a rulemaking
on Security Training for Surface Transportation Employees (86 Fed. Reg.
23629).
Accordingly, APTA strongly recommends that the Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure urge TSA to utilize the federal
rulemaking process for this security directive and allow for public
comment before imposing any new requirements. Publication in the
Federal Register, with an opportunity for notice and comment, will
allow all affected parties, including APTA members, to identify
concerns and potential impacts of the proposed requirements on rail
transit and passenger rail operations, and would provide TSA sufficient
time to address any issues raised during the process.
In addition, APTA recommends that TSA provide technical assistance,
workshops, response plan templates, and funding for public transit
agencies to implement the requirements of any final security directive.
We welcome any opportunity to work with the Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure to address these important issues and
ensure that rail transit and passenger rail operators continue to meet
any cyber or other security challenges that may arise.
Sincerely,
Paul P. Skoutelas,
President and CEO.

Mr. Crawford. Ms. Newhouse, how much stakeholder engagement
has TSA conducted while working on these directives?
And how is TSA specifically incorporating feedback into
these directives?
Ms. Newhouse. Thank you, Congressman.
We have continued robust engagement and, frankly, we have
been working extremely closely with the United States
intelligence community, our partners at CISA, and particularly
the Departments of Homeland Security, DOT, Department of
Energy, and across the interagency to provide that background
information, that threat information that is driving all of
these requirements.
As recently as this week, I, along with several of my top
leadership here at TSA, have met with freight rail and
passenger rail executives with a classified briefing in our
facilities to show them what we are seeing, elicit input, and
ask them for more input for either future requirements or other
guidelines that we could issue together, versus us just telling
them this is what they need to do.
So, we have--we have been having some successful
engagements. As a matter of fact, today, a number of pipeline
individuals, CISOs, and other security personnel are receiving
briefings, as we speak, and we do have an apparatus around the
United States to support those briefings, thanks to our law
enforcement and intelligence community partners.
Mr. DeFazio. I thank the----
Mr. Crawford. Will you consider utilizing the Federal
rulemaking process for any future cyber requirements?
Mr. DeFazio. I think his time has expired.
Ms. Newhouse. Absolutely, Congressman. All of those options
are on the table.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. DeFazio. I thank the gentleman. Representative Norton
is now recognized.
Ms. Norton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I hope
everyone can hear me. My first question is for Mr. Schachter of
DOT, Mr. Grossman of FAA, and Ms. Newhouse of TSA. I am
interested in information sharing among Federal partners.
You each oversee critical infrastructure entities, with
some overlap, especially regarding aviation and surface
transportation, which I am particularly interested in because I
sit on the Subcommittee on Aviation, and serve as chair of the
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit.
Can you explain to us in some detail how you collaborate to
oversee the same sectors and critical infrastructure entities?
[Pause.]
Ms. Norton. Mr. Schachter, Mr. Grossman, Ms. Newhouse?
Mr. Schachter. Am I on mute?
Thank you very much for that question, Congresswoman.
Information sharing is vital to securing the Nation's critical
infrastructure, and the infrastructure that DOT is responsible
for.
We collaborate extensively within DOT. We collaborate with
the FAA, and also with our Federal partners--in particular,
TSA, CISA, and even with OMB, which houses the Federal chief
information security officer. Chris DeRusha, the Federal Chief
Information Security Officer, was one of the first Federal
officials that I met--virtually, of course--after joining the
DOT in late August.
I have had subsequent sessions with Jen Easterly, as well
as Chris Inglis, the Assistant Director and National Cyber
Director. And we intend to keep up an open channel of
communication, as well as following up on various directives
and formal information sharing that DHS has required.
Ms. Norton. Thank you.
Mr. Marinos, Mr. Dorsey, can you highlight cybersecurity
issues that give you the most concern, and also explain why you
believe the Government has repeatedly failed to fully address
them?
Mr. Marinos. Yes, Congresswoman. I could jump in first, and
perhaps Kevin can go after.
I think the bottom line is that we are constantly operating
behind the eight ball. The reality is that it just takes one
successful cyberattack to take down an organization, and each
Federal agency, as well as owners and operators in critical
infrastructure, have to protect themselves against countless
numbers of attacks. And so, in order to do that, we need our
Federal Government to be operating in the most strategic way
possible.
So, as I mentioned in my oral statement, the importance of
having a national strategy isn't just to have something on
paper, but to actually execute that strategy. And that also
carries forward to those agencies like the Department of
Transportation, TSA, and others who have sector-specific
responsibilities to do the same.
We have seen consistently in our work that agencies have
had challenges in maintaining very up-to-date sector plans that
actually would talk about the cyber threats that agencies are
facing and the infrastructure is facing today. So, we think it
is very important for sector-specific agencies to work with
their industry partners to make sure that they are operating
off the same song sheet, if you will.
Ms. Norton. Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. DeFazio. I thank the gentlelady for yielding back. I am
now going to yield the chair to Andre Carson, who, as we all
know, has a loud and booming voice, and you will be able to
understand him. So, thank you.
Mr. Carson [presiding]. Thank you, Chair, I hope you feel
better. We appreciate you.
Mr. Gibbs?
Mr. Gibbs. Thank you, Chair. This hearing is titled, ``The
Evolving Cybersecurity Landscape: Federal Perspectives on
Securing the Nation's Infrastructure.'' I was really kind of
surprised we didn't bring in a witness from the Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA. It might be a good
idea for the future.
Admiral Mauger, we had testimony in the past, and we know
that the Coast Guard is trying to update your own IT systems
and the significant challenges you face in doing that. Can you
provide us an update on how the Coast Guard is working to
improve in this area, and improve your IT systems that you have
been mandated by Congress to do?
Admiral Mauger. Congressman Gibbs, our approach to
protecting the maritime transportation system relies on us
having our own ability to defend and operate our networks.
And so, as part of the Commandant's strategy for our work
ahead, he has put defend and operate the networks, protect
maritime critical infrastructure, and enable Coast Guard
operations as those three pillars for how we move forward to
accomplish all of our missions.
With regard to defending and operating our networks through
investments in the CARES Act, with over $65 million in funding,
we have been able to make significant investments to modernize
our infrastructure and push more information out to our mobile
users out in the field, and our cutters underway.
But all of this is premised--our security is premised on it
being an operational imperative. And so, the key thing that has
really driven us forward is the establishment of Coast Guard
Cyber Command as an operational command under the purview of a
two-star commander that oversees our daily mission execution in
the IT space, and then the coordination with our CIO, who is
driving those investments and modernization projects forward.
Mr. Gibbs. OK, thank you. Also, Admiral, can you expand a
little bit on the activities and resources you are making
available to the ports to work with our port facilities at the
port level on their IT infrastructure, cybersecurity?
Admiral Mauger. Congressman, at the port level we are
really focused on working across the prevention and response
framework to ensure that we have the ability to defend, and
then also respond resiliently from attacks. This is a shared
responsibility between the private sector and the Federal
agencies involved, and so we are doing a number of different
things.
First of all, we put standards in place that require them
to conduct assessments, have an accountable person, develop a
plan, mitigate that plan, exercise it, and report incidents.
All those pieces are really important.
Through those assessments, we then have the opportunity to
drive investments through the Port Security Grant Program to
update security posture in the ports. And so last year, $17
million was allocated from the Port Security Grant Program for
cybersecurity.
These are some of the things that are being done to
increase the capability of the commercial infrastructure, while
also maintaining our operational ability.
Mr. Gibbs. Also, Admiral, as your role as assistant
commandant for prevention policy, you are responsible for the
Coast Guard's maritime safety and security regulatory programs.
Which side is winning: the increased cyber threats or increased
digital-based safety operational enhancements?
How are we doing? I guess the question is, how are we doing
in this fight? Who is winning it?
Admiral Mauger. Congressman, it is not an either/or
proposition for this. It is really an all-of-the-above.
And so, as the assistant commandant for prevention policy,
we make sure that we bring together the best of our ability to
secure private industry, but then be able to respond, as well.
And so, leveraging our prevention and response framework, we
have made sure that we have taken a multilayered approach to
engaging with the industry, sharing information with them at
the local level through the Area Maritime Security Committees,
and conducting compliance activities, and then, at the national
level, engaging across the interagency with our National
Maritime Security Advisory Committee, with the MTS-ISAC, and
then with other interagency partners to make sure that we are
tied together, and providing a comprehensive network and
comprehensive approach to this problem.
Mr. Gibbs. All right, thank you. I am just about out of
time. I just wanted to mention that I know you are not a
cybersecurity expert yourself, and so, hopefully, you are aware
of that fact, and you are coordinating with your cybersecurity
people, both at the Coast Guard, and also in the private
sector.
And I have to yield back, I am out of time. Thank you for
your service.
Mr. Carson. Mr. Larsen?
Mr. Larsen. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Dorsey, has the GAO investigated the progress of the
Federal agencies or the private sector in implementing the
guidance and requirements laid out in the May Executive order
from the President to modernize and strengthen the defense of
Federal technology systems?
Mr. Dorsey. Thank you for that question, Congressman.
However, you asked whether or not the GAO has investigated. I
think that question should be directed towards the GAO
representative. That is, if I am not mistaken.
Mr. Larsen. I am sorry, yes. Well, the GAO representative
Mr. Marinos, can answer that.
Mr. Marinos. Yes, Congressman, happy to. We have looked at
aspects of the Executive order. We, actually, just have work
underway right now, specifically looking at the progress that
has been made by the administration in actually overseeing
whether the many requirements that it has placed on agencies
have actually been adhered to.
So, there are aspects within it that our work has touched
on, including cloud computing and supply chain, more recently,
but we have work underway right now that is going to be looking
squarely at the Executive order.
Mr. Larsen. And do you have the timeline laid out for the
report already?
Mr. Marinos. We are expecting to be able to periodically
report on the status of implementing the Executive order
throughout the upcoming calendar year. So, we are looking to
provide information out sort of in a real-time basis, looking
to provide something closer to the early spring.
Mr. Larsen. Early spring? Thank you.
And Mr. Dorsey, then, I will go back to you. At what point
would the DOT IG get involved?
Mr. Dorsey. Thank you for your question, Congressman.
Actually, we have actually already initiated a review of the
DOT's efforts to implement cloud-based services with respect to
the request, or issues that were identified in the Presidential
Executive order directing Federal agencies to ensure that they
secure their cloud-based services as they migrate forward.
We are also planning to look at the Department's efforts to
implement or migrate towards a zero trust architecture, as
outlined in the President's Executive order, too.
I have also been in contact with the Department's chief
information officer, and he has informed me that the Department
is working towards addressing the current initiatives, and I
plan to work with him over the next year or two to ensure that
the Department is doing what they say they are planning to do,
as well as report back to the administration, as necessary.
Thank you.
Mr. Larsen. Thank you.
Mr. Grossman, the U.S. aviation sector is very complex. I
am sure that you are considering that complexity as you
consider how to make the system less vulnerable to
cyberattacks.
But the testimony from GAO in the first part of the hearing
a few weeks ago stated that less than half of the respondents
to a global study investigating cybersecurity trends within the
air transport industry identified cybersecurity as a top
organizational risk.
Have you all considered how Congress can incentivize the
private sector to address cybersecurity issues?
Mr. Grossman. How Congress can----
Mr. Larsen. Incentivize the private sector to address these
cybersecurity issues that continue to persist in the air
transport industry.
Mr. Grossman. Well, we have reached out to industry through
the Aviation Cyber Initiative extensively. We have built a
community of interest of over 1,000 members that is across all
of the components of the aviation ecosystem. And we are using
the bully pulpit, and it seems to be, from an aviation
perspective, we seem to be gaining a lot of traction.
Mr. Larsen. Can I follow up on that with a particular
issue? And I don't know if you are handling this at FAA, but
Chair DeFazio and I recently have expressed safety concerns to
the Federal Communications Commission on the telecom industry's
plan to utilize the C-band for 5G broadband service, and the
potential interference with aircraft radio altimeters.
I know that Administrator Dickson is weighing in on this
with the FCC. Can you update us on what the status of that is,
and, as well, are there other technologies that are coming
online that we need to be concerned about?
Mr. Grossman. Well, Congressman, thank you for that
question.
I am not personally involved with the 5G effort, but I am
aware that the telecommunications companies have voluntarily
agreed to a 1-month deployment delay to their 5G C-band to
allow further safety analysis.
We believe that aviation and 5G C-band wireless services
can safely coexist, and the FCC and FAA are using this time to
gather and exchange information to come up with a path forward.
Mr. Larsen. Yes, and I guess implied in our letter is that
whatever solution you all think you come up with, that we would
be very interested in that solution to make some determinations
about our own thoughts on it.
Mr. Grossman. Absolutely.
Mr. Larsen. Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Carson. Thank you.
Mr. Perry?
Mr. Perry. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Schachter and Mr. Marinos, during last month's hearing
on cybersecurity threats, I had an interesting back-and-forth
with Mr. Scott Belcher from the Mineta Transportation Institute
regarding the increased cybersecurity threats associated with
the transition to electric buses, and the fact that it brings
with it a whole new level of cyber exposure and other security
risks not previously anticipated.
Mr. Belcher agreed that these increased risks include the
ability to degrade batteries remotely, cause fires, manually
take over controls of the vehicle, et cetera, and went on as
far as to say we would be safer if we were still running diesel
buses.
Now, I am a fan of both diesel and--well, all of them. We
have just got to be ready to implement the processes to make
sure that we are safe.
While we were discussing these issues in the context of
electric buses purchased by transit agencies with FTA funding,
these concerns are much more widespread than just buses. In
fact, the same concerns apply to our electric vehicles, owned
either by the Government or by private citizens, and the
associated charging infrastructure.
I wonder if either of you can expand on the significant
increase in cybersecurity risks and threats we should expect as
the result of the reckless pursuit of an electrified vehicle
fleet by the majority, this administration, and, unfortunately,
some Socialist-voting Members of my own party. Can you expand
upon what we can expect?
Mr. Schachter. Well, thank you. Thank you for that
question.
I think we are conflating two separate and very important
issues. One is the fuel that any vehicle uses, whether it is
electric power, diesel power. Inherently, they are not more or
less at risk, from a cyber perspective.
What we are really talking about here, and the cyber issue,
is the electronic control system that is on board with not only
electric buses, but if you were to buy a new diesel bus, or
gasoline bus, or gasoline car, those vehicles all have some
sort of electronic control system there, communications system,
which is potentially vulnerable. And the correct steps, just
like in protecting Government IT systems, the correct steps
need to be taken to protect the IT system in that vehicle.
And when we are talking about fossil-fuel powered vehicles
or electric vehicles--obviously, the administration has
identified addressing climate change as a top priority. And if
we take the conversation to the subject of this hearing, which
is cybersecurity, there are means and mechanisms of protecting
those vehicles' intelligence systems on board. And we need to
do that. And there are several organizations within DOT at work
on that right now.
Mr. Perry. Mr. Marinos?
Mr. Marinos. Yes, Congressman. We have looked at issues
with respect to modern vehicle cybersecurity over the last
several years. And indeed, whether the fuel is gas or electric,
the reality is that we are seeing an increase in the number of
interfaces, the number of chips that are being placed, and the
systems that those chips are powering.
In fact, that is what we are seeing right now, as one of
the challenges in terms of supply chain, is having those chips
to be able to manufacture new cars, regardless of the fuel.
The reality is that, if those interfaces are not properly
secured, they can be exploited through direct physical access,
and even remotely, as well. I think the reality, and maybe the
very important element to this, is the need for our workforce
to be able to be in the best position to oversee these types of
automated technologies. And, as we reported back earlier this
year, we think that the Department of Transportation needs to
take a close look at its workforce to make sure that, as
vehicles become more and more autonomous, that they have the
appropriate folks in place to oversee that type of technology.
Mr. Perry. Given DOT's lackluster cybersecurity posture at
this moment, do you think they are prepared to deal with a
massive increase in risk?
And I would characterize--while I know that all of them
have electronic interfaces, chips, and so on and so forth, not
all of them have the ability to set the battery on fire if they
are not battery-powered, if the battery is just in there to
start the vehicle.
But would you say that they are prepared to deal with the
increase in risk?
Mr. Marinos. I think that the Department--and I don't want
to speak on its behalf, but in response to our recent work--I
think would also recognize that it has more to do, in terms of
being able to fill the skill gaps that they are going to need
to fill to be in the best position to oversee this emerging
technology.
Mr. Perry. Mr. Schachter?
Mr. Schachter. I would say DOT's security posture is on par
or even better than other organizations that I have observed.
All of us--the Government, as a whole, as well as
individual agencies--will have a continual challenge to meet
cybersecurity requirements. And, as we have said earlier in the
hearing, we receive thousands of cybersecurity attacks every
day, and only one has to slip through. So, normal batting
averages here don't apply. We have to be perfect to protect our
systems, our agencies, the Government, and the American people.
It is an immense challenge with limited resources. We all know
that.
So that--I think DOT's posture is forward. Its attempts to
include some of the very latest technologies--we were already
on the road to many of the items that are contained in
President Biden's Executive order on cybersecurity before that
Executive order was issued.
The audit that was referred to a little while ago by Mr.
Dorsey regarding cloud services, they are seen as a best
practice, as opposed to desktop applications, because they can
be better protected from a common perimeter. And DOT had
previously organized itself into a--using a common operating
environment, unifying all of the operating modes, with the
exception of FAA, into a single system, thereby providing one
surface to protect from attacks. That is a best practice.
We were there prior--toward the----
Mr. Carson. The gentleman's time has expired.
Mr. Perry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield.
Mr. Carson. Mrs. Napolitano?
Mrs. Napolitano. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Marinos, you highlight in the testimony that, in
February of this year, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency issued an alert explaining that the cyber
threat actors obtained an unauthorized access to a U.S. water
treatment facility's industrial control system and attempted to
increase the amount of caustic chemical that is used as part of
the treatment process.
My biggest concern is on security of our water systems,
including our treatment plants, our dams, and our waterways.
Are we doing enough to address the water systems' security? And
what are your concerns in this area?
Mr. Marinos. Simply put, we aren't, Congresswoman. The
threats to the water infrastructure are real, and it comes from
many of the same challenges that other sectors like it suffer,
which include a reliance on legacy systems, systems that are
not only outdated, but beyond even being supported by the
vendors that actually created them.
These include also workforce issues, having appropriate
staff within often very small organizations that manage these
types of facilities to be able to respond. In fact, in the case
of the February attack, or the attempted attack, it was
fortunate that there was, according to reports, an official
that was actually monitoring, and was able to see the efforts
as it happened, so they were able to thwart it.
And so, I think the reality is that there needs to be more
that is done. We are encouraged by the fact that Congress
passed a law last year to establish in law the expectations of
sector-specific agencies, known as Sector Risk Management
Agencies, and the Environmental Protection Agency is that for
the water sector.
We think that EPA can do more to reach out to the sector to
better understand whether the guidance that it provides is
adequate to be able to address many of the challenges that I
mentioned.
Mrs. Napolitano. Would you suggest that they do training,
virtual training of all water agencies, small and large?
Mr. Marinos. Yes, I think that it is important for them to
do that, in concert with their sector partners. And so, there
is a good establishment of both Government and sector-specific
representation that, as I am aware, based on even the prior
hearing that your committee held, are working towards better
training.
But the reality is that we need to continue to see that
happen more rapidly, because those cyber threats continue to
evolve, as well.
Mrs. Napolitano. Well, that is everyday security. We are
having 1,000 or more security threats a day. Certainly, we can
train people what to look for, initially, without having to
wait months for training.
Mr. Marinos. That is a very important point, Congresswoman.
It is about elevating the entire cybersecurity awareness of the
Nation. The reality is that, until we do that, the bad guys are
going to continue to exploit those that have the least
knowledge and expertise in this area.
Mrs. Napolitano. So, what are your biggest concerns in the
area?
Mr. Marinos. Well, I think first and foremost is making
sure that the support that Federal Government agencies is
providing is the right one, and that means doing more to assess
what the actual risks are to the specific sectors, and then
reflecting that in actual plans that they can execute.
Mrs. Napolitano. Would that be EPA's responsibility?
Mr. Marinos. That would be EPA's. It would also be the
Department of Homeland Security within CISA.
We are still waiting to see a National Infrastructure
Protection Plan get updated, hoping to see that in the next
couple of years. But unfortunately, sectors can't wait to do
that themselves.
Mrs. Napolitano. Well, we should promote some kind of
movement to immediately start assisting the agencies that have
no way of knowing what to look for.
Mr. Marinos. Well, actually, Congresswoman, you have done
that in law. So, Congress did pass a law that tasked GAO with
evaluating how effective Sector Risk Management Agencies are in
fulfilling their statutory responsibilities. So, we will be
reporting back to you in the near future.
Mrs. Napolitano. Yes, but many agencies are too small. They
don't have personnel that are either equipped or trained, and
they may not know that the new law exists, and it would help in
being able to help them identify. So, we need to go down to the
grassroots, to the smallest of the small.
Mr. Marinos. I would agree. I think a better--not only
better information about what the expectations and
responsibilities are, but also what offerings the Federal
Government can provide through CISA, through EPA, and others to
those operators that need the help is very important.
Mrs. Napolitano. Well, with the Army Corps' oversight over
the dams, I think they should be part of it, too.
Mr. Marinos. They are part of the sectors that have been
identified. So, responsibilities do carry forward to the
agencies that have responsibilities for dams, as well.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you very much for your concern, and
I look forward to talking to you later.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Carson. The gentlelady yields back.
Mr. Davis?
Mr. Rodney Davis. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
First, Ms. Newhouse, we understand that TSA will soon
release security directives for passenger rail, freight rail,
and rail transit operators.
But unfortunately, though, we have heard concerns about the
development of these directives from stakeholders, not the TSA,
including from the freight rail industry. And that was at our
previous hearing on cybersecurity and in a November 4th letter
from the American Public Transportation Association, which, Mr.
Chair, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the record.
Mr. Carson. Without objection.
[This letter was submitted for the record by Hon. Eric A.
``Rick'' Crawford on page 179.]
Mr. Rodney Davis. Thank you.
Ms. Newhouse, it is good to see you again. I can't wait to
see you all in person.
Unfortunately, the TSA failed to provide this committee
with advance notice of this, despite that you were coming here
the same week to discuss these same cybersecurity issues.
Committee staff even asked and were essentially told to wait
for official congressional notification, despite what we knew
of other committees receiving advance notice.
After back-and-forth by staff, I am told we received an
embargoed copy at 9:25 a.m. this morning, which really doesn't
give our team or us any time to meaningfully review, and
actually figure out what important questions we might have for
you today to ask you about it.
Further, the letters attached indicate that the directives
were actually issued yesterday, December 1st, which was--I just
want you to take a message back, Ms. Newhouse, that this
committee--because we, obviously, have some jurisdiction over
the issues we are talking about today, otherwise you wouldn't
be here--we expect to be notified of actions that your agency
is going to take, just like other committees get that
notification.
If anything you are doing is going to affect the modes of
transportation, and the safety of those modes of
transportation, and the areas that we have jurisdiction over,
we expect to be notified here. I mean, we are one of the
largest committees in Congress. Can you please make sure you
send that message back to your colleagues, and take that
message back to TSA, too? Because we are pretty frustrated. And
frankly, these are issues that I think we all ought to work
together on, and--instead of have a minimal amount of time to
be able to address them.
But thank you, it is great to see you. I hope to talk to
you again in the future, and I look forward to our next
meeting.
Mr. Marinos, it is my understanding that the GAO is in the
process of completing its annual report on cybersecurity and
surveillance threats to Congress. In undertaking this
assessment, how has GAO pursued access to House and Senate
cybersecurity data, and how does the GAO plan to ensure that
information about Congress' cyber posture remains secure?
Mr. Marinos. Well, first, Congressman, I just want to say
that we appreciate Congress tasking us with this important
review, and we take the responsibility of performing it very
seriously.
In terms of how we are protecting the information, we
recognize that the information that we have been asked to
review is very sensitive, but we also have a very long,
successful track record of handling and protecting sensitive
information that we receive from Government agencies, and also
from industry. And we will, obviously, apply the most rigorous
protections that we can to the information that we that we
receive.
Mr. Rodney Davis. Well, as you can imagine, access to House
data is something that we all--Republicans, Democrats--guard
very closely. However, we also recognize GAO's expertise in
this area, and hope congressional entities are cooperating so
that we achieve the desired aim of the annual report. So, thank
you, again.
Another question, Mr. Marinos. We have seen attacks on our
critical infrastructure, including the one earlier this year on
the Colonial Pipeline, as mentioned in earlier testimony.
Monitoring is critical to thwart future attacks. However,
monitoring is not the end of what our efforts should be, and we
should have a layered approach to cybersecurity, especially
when protecting our Nation's most vital infrastructure assets.
Can you tell us--and this may be a question for DOT also,
Mr. Schachter--what is the Department of Transportation doing
to fortify our critical assets in the field, such as air
traffic control towers, pipelines, and railroads, that are
carrying hazardous materials or passengers, so that they can
operate effectively when malicious actors have already
compromised the integrity of the network?
Let's just go to you, Mr. Schachter. Can you answer that
with the time I have left?
Mr. Schachter. Sure. Thank you very much for the question.
So, DOT, in each of the areas that you mentioned, is
working with our private-sector partners to improve their
cybersecurity practices. And, as stated before, our cooperation
through TSA to those private-sector partners, we act as co-
sector risk management officials in those areas. So, we need
the participation from all of those parties to become more
cyber secure.
Mr. Rodney Davis. Well, we continue to offer to work with
you on these endeavors. And I apologize for mispronouncing your
name earlier, Mr. Schachter.
Thank you all for being here today, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. Carson. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. Johnson?
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank
you to the witnesses for your time and your testimony today.
During part 1 of this hearing, we learned how our critical
infrastructure remains vulnerable to cyberattacks. And in
October of 2021, the DOT's OIG released a report on the Federal
Transit Administration's cybersecurity weaknesses, which found
that weaknesses in FTA's financial management systems could
affect its ability to disburse COVID-19 funds.
In Atlanta, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit
Authority has been anticipating $284 million in emergency
funding, which is critical to the mobility of our residents,
especially communities of color and essential workers who
disproportionately depend on transit to get to work and school.
My constituents can't afford a delay in funding because of a
cybersecurity incident.
The OIG report notes that the FTA has failed to fix
weaknesses that have been known since 2016, a total of 5 years.
While the delay is not unique to FTA, it puts us all at risk.
Mr. Dorsey, why has FTA moved so slowly to implement security
control fixes?
Mr. Dorsey. Thank you for your question, Congressman.
We have worked with the Department for a number of years
regarding the various cybersecurity weaknesses that we have
identified through our reviews of the various--what we call
system-level reviews. And with respect to FTA, what the
Department had informed us was the fact that they had accepted
the risk for a number of reasons regarding why they had these
longstanding weaknesses.
One of the reasons was primarily because they said they had
to get the proper guidance at the Department level, with
respect to addressing some of the weaknesses.
Another reason was the fact that they had stated that they
were concerned about decommissioning their systems or upgrading
their systems for the fear that the systems needed to be
operational 24/7.
With those issues in mind, we decided to report out on
those particular weaknesses. And what the FTA decided to do,
after we had reported out, they indicated to us that they would
take the immediate actions to address our concerns.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Well----
Mr. Dorsey. However, regarding the vulnerabilities
associated with the 6 years or so associated with outdated
databases, the Department had indicated----
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Well----
Mr. Dorsey [continuing]. They would provide us with a
response by 2023.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Well, let me ask you, is there
anything that Congress needs to do to ensure that FTA maintains
better control over their cybersecurity?
Mr. Dorsey. I believe what Congress can do is work with the
Department, and maybe provide a sprint initiative, if you will,
and require them to make sure they prioritize the
implementation of what we consider to be some of the most
significant cybersecurity weaknesses that we have identified
over the years, and make sure that they follow up with Congress
and report on their attempts and efforts to address those
weaknesses.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you.
Mr. Schachter, as the chief information officer at DOT, you
lead on IT and cybersecurity issues. How can you ensure that
DOT's component agencies, such as FTA and FAA, have the
resources, capabilities, and leadership to correct current
cybersecurity deficiencies, so that cities like Atlanta are not
detrimentally impacted?
Mr. Schachter. Well, thank you very much for that question.
And as I specified in my testimony, cybersecurity is our
number-one priority. And I highlighted three areas that we are
prioritizing within that to take immediate action: the first is
access control; the second is website security; and the third
is governance and coordination across DOT. All of those issues
are impacted, involved in the situations that you mentioned and
Mr. Dorsey has mentioned.
We have created cyber sprints, that I also referenced in my
testimony, as a way to expedite improved performance in all of
these areas. And I believe we will be able to report back to
you later this year that we have made significant improvements.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. My time is up, and I
yield back.
Mr. Carson. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. Babin?
Dr. Babin. Sir, thank you, Mr. Chairman. As I said the
other week, when we had witnesses from the private sector here,
I am so glad that we are having this hearing, and prioritizing
this very important topic, for this committee to weigh in on
the issue of cybersecurity in the transportation and critical
infrastructure space. It is a great responsibility, and one we
should all take very, very seriously.
It is also a very timely topic. Right before we went home
for Thanksgiving, the Director of CISA told the House Homeland
Security Committee that ``ransomware has become the scourge on
nearly every facet of our lives, and it's a prime example of
the vulnerabilities that are emerging as our digital and our
physical infrastructure increasingly converge.'' She went on to
say that, ``The American way of life faces serious risks.''
She is right. internet attacks are a full-fledged standard
feature of our modern-day life. Hardly a day passes anymore
without a media story breaking about a cyberattack, or at least
a threat. These threats are disruptive, costly, and potentially
life threatening. All of us saw what happened with the Colonial
Pipeline breach last May, and how the attack led to gas
shortages and interrupted supply chains.
There is certainly a legitimate and appropriate role for us
in the Federal Government to play in protecting the American
people and our companies and businesses against theft,
espionage, and cyberattacks. No question that each of you
testifying here today are fighting for our national security.
However, as you all know, cyber intrusions are very hard to
track.
We have got to be extraordinarily careful, as lawmakers,
and as rulemakers, that we don't meddle in something that we
don't properly understand, and unintentionally create more
bloated regulation, or stifle innovation with overly burdensome
requirements that don't truly secure our infrastructure. Any
policy that we push forward has got to be aggressive, but
consistent with our Nation's founding principles. Meanwhile, we
provide for the common defense, while at the same time
protecting civil liberties and free economic markets.
Former Director of National Intelligence, and my former
Texas colleague and classmate, John Ratcliffe, said that we
need to attribute these attacks and either overtly or covertly
retaliate against those responsible, thereby creating a
deterrent for the future. If our long-term strategy to cyber
criminals is just to simply pay the ransoms, and hope for the
best with cyber insurance, we will certainly lose to our foes
in this new battlefront.
So, my question for you all is this, and I will open this
to anyone who would like to answer, time permitting: What are
some commonsense steps we, as lawmakers, can take to help you,
our partners in the executive branch, better protect our
infrastructure, and to encourage better reporting of cyber
threats without infringing on people's civil liberties and the
free market? I will open that up.
Mr. Schachter. Thank you for that----
Admiral Mauger. Congressman--go ahead. I will yield to my
colleague at DOT.
Dr. Babin. OK. Then, Admiral, you can come on second. Thank
you.
Mr. Schachter. Thank you, Congressman. Thank you, Admiral,
I will try to be brief.
I think your--one, a summary of your statement,
Congressman, is that cybersecurity is everyone's
responsibility, public sector and private sector, and we are
all going to either succeed or fail at this together.
And I think, from a congressional standpoint, it is
understanding that new systems, or improvements to existing
systems, need to be secure by design, and created with
cybersecurity in mind. That is step 1. That would help us
achieve our objectives. Thank you.
Dr. Babin. Thank you.
Admiral?
Admiral Mauger. Congressman, thank you. I support the
comments made by Mr. Schachter there, at DOT. What I would
offer, as well, though, is that we have to treat cybersecurity
as an operational imperative, and it has to be part of an
overall risk management approach within--about the private
sector and the Federal Government.
And so, I think that in order to achieve that, you have to
have an accountable person, they have to be able to do an
assessment, and understand the risks. They have to be empowered
to manage those risks. And then it also comes back to
exercising and reporting.
When it comes to reporting, right now we have to change the
paradigm from ``what is the minimum I need to disclose?'' to
``how can I help protect others?'' Because, as we've heard
through testimony already, these incidents cut across so many
different infrastructures, and reporting really helps us to
make us all stronger, Congressman.
Dr. Babin. Absolutely. Thank you so very much. And I hope
that we will remember retaliation can curtail some of this.
I will yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Carson. The gentleman yields back. At this time, I will
yield to myself.
Mr. Grossman, the aviation sector is composed of aircraft,
airlines, airports, and aviation operators, such as air traffic
control personnel and ground crew. As you know, it's a mix of
private-sector companies and public agencies, including the
FAA. However, a cyberattack on one portion of this sector can
have cascading effects on the entire system, with devastating
impacts to the public.
Can you describe, from a cybersecurity perspective, how the
FAA assists and supports the aviation sector?
Mr. Grossman. Absolutely, thank you for that question,
Congressman. The FAA engages with industry on several fronts.
We are a regulator and a collaborator.
So, from a collaboration perspective, we engage with much
of the aviation community through efforts like the Aviation
ISAC, which we are close partners with; the Aviation Sector
Coordinating Council; manufacturer associations; and, of
course, through our primary engagement, the ACI, the Aviation
Cyber Initiative. In these engagements, we share best practices
and standards, guidance, and we promote information sharing.
As a regulator, we work directly with manufacturers and
[inaudible] standards to assure that these two are kind of
married up, and so folks are using industry standards, and are
building products that are appropriate.
Mr. Carson. So, in defending the aviation sector from
various cyber crimes, do you believe it is important to
coordinate and even cooperate with the private sector to assist
them?
Mr. Grossman. Well, I think, as Mr. Schachter mentioned
earlier, cybersecurity is a team sport, and we are all in this
together. The public and private sector work together, which is
really why we formed the cyber initiative for aviation itself,
across the entire ecosystem, so we can work more
collaboratively with operators, manufacturers, and other
agencies. Private and public sectors work together to share
information and to try to improve the resiliency of the
ecosystem.
Mr. Carson. So, this is for the entire panel: Where do you
see the biggest cyber threats coming from, from specific actors
like the recent attacks on local government entities with
ransomware, from foreign entities, from nonstate actors?
Are there significant threats from even some of our own
weaknesses, like our failure to update and strengthen our cyber
infrastructure, or poor cyber hygiene, and failure to apply
strict cybersecurity protocols?
What are your insights?
Mr. Grossman. Well, Congressman, I think you just listed
them all. I don't know that any of us--I don't want to speak
for the rest of the panel--would highlight one over the other.
We are all aware of the recent compromise of SolarWinds
that occurred last year, but there are other threats out there.
And I think that compromise is certainly still fresh in our
minds. But, I wouldn't choose that actor over other actors or
other vulnerabilities, if you were asking me which is worse.
Mr. Marinos. But I would like to just mention that--I think
it has come up several times, both from the witnesses and from
the congressmen, as well--it is the interdependencies between
the critical infrastructure that make this so challenging.
So, we are talking about transportation, and transportation
not only relies on other sectors to operate effectively, but
other sectors rely on it, as well. We issued a report just last
month on the communication sector, and the transportation
sector was one of those sectors that had been identified by
CISA as one it depended on. In other words, it could not
operate without it.
And so, I think the challenge there is, while there is
resiliency built in, in many ways, to physical attacks, the
cyberattacks continue to show us that we need to do more to not
only shore up specific sectors, but the entire Nation's
approach to cybersecurity, as well, which is why we emphasized
in our recent work the importance of having a national cyber
strategy, so that it can be an all-in-Government effort to
elevate our cyber capabilities within the Nation.
Mr. Carson. Thank you. Thank you all.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana?
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I
appreciate the witnesses testifying today, and I appreciate the
importance of this topic. We have offered a number of
amendments trying to increase funds for different cybersecurity
programs related to infrastructure, and I think this is
critically important.
Ms. Newhouse, and perhaps Admiral, your testimonies discuss
information sharing between TSA and the Coast Guard to identify
and manage threats in the maritime transportation system. How
do you communicate the threats to the individual ports, and how
do you help to manage risk within the MTS?
Admiral Mauger. Congressman, thanks for that question. So,
unity of effort within the Coast Guard is part of our DNA, and
so we take a multilevel approach to share information at the
speed of cyber here, with the industry. But this is a dynamic
threat environment. And going forward, we need to use a
combination of both existing tools and new tools, or new
methods, to get after the information sharing.
So, for this multilevel approach at the local level, we
work through our Area Maritime Security Committees. Each of
those have established cyber subcommittees that are responsible
for that day-to-day sharing of information, for conducting the
exercises, for reviewing best practices, and understanding how
to move forward. Those same people, then, are integral to
response efforts when they occur in the ports.
At the national level, we work through a number of
different means. We have established a Maritime Cyber Readiness
Branch within our Coast Guard Cyber Command that really becomes
a focal point for threat information, dissemination, technical
assistance to the field, and connection to the interagency. We
have embedded folks in CISA. We meet regularly with the other
Sector Risk Management Agencies. We engage with the MTS
Information Sharing and Analysis Center, and we look for every
opportunity to continue to share information, communicate
threats, and understand the vulnerabilities in this industry,
so we can protect the MTS.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you.
And TSA, anything to update there?
Ms. Newhouse. Thank you, Congressman. And to complement
Admiral Mauger's information, I would like to say, yes, the
United States Coast Guard has primacy in our Nation's ports.
However, TSA plays an important role to support the security of
the maritime transportation system.
To that end, we have, actually, developed the TSA exercise
training program, which started, frankly, as a port STEP,
Security Training and Exercise Program. It started in the
maritime sector in the mid-2000s. We have grown that training
and exercise program across all modes of transportation.
The U.S. Coast Guard is an important partner, where, as
Admiral Mauger mentioned, we can actually exercise at both a
national and a local level. And if an entity is not able to
participate, we do maintain all of those lessons learned and
exercise information in accessible systems to thousands of
local operators, first responders, and those law enforcement
professionals who support the security of the Nation's ports
and other transportation modes.
Congress also generously chartered the Surface
Transportation Security Advisory Committee a few years ago.
Amongst the members includes, obviously, our stakeholders, our
private-sector stakeholders representing a multitude of
interests across all surface transportation modes. However, we
also have 14 Federal agencies that also serve on that committee
as nonvoting, contributing members, so our----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Ms. Newhouse? Ms. Newhouse, I
think my concern is, if we have a very active, very live
incident, the ability to quickly communicate and disseminate
that information with the ports, I am not sure that the
security committees or the apparatus that you are describing
allows for that direct and sort of nimble communication to the
ports and other potential threatened entities out there. And
that is where my concern is.
I just have about 45 seconds left, I wanted to ask one
other question of the Coast Guard, and then I am going to
follow up with you all through questions for the record.
Admiral, can you tell me whether or not you all are working
with FEMA to update the NIMS system to be able to track and
follow through on cyber incidents?
Admiral Mauger. Congressman, in terms of, first of all,
communication with the ports, we have 24-hour watches that have
access to the information and share that information. But I
look forward to your questions, and followup questions.
With regard to incident response, we stand up at the local
level a unified command, which is a structure that was
established under NIMS to be able to respond to incidents. And
we can be happy to provide more information about that, and
follow up, or later during this hearing, if you would like.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. That would be great. And maybe
NIMS isn't the perfect system, but it seems like there needs to
be some type of mechanism like that for tracking
accountability.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Carson. The gentleman yields back.
Ms. Titus?
Ms. Titus. Thank you very much. I would like to go back and
follow up on some of Mr. Carson's comments about coordinating
with the private sector.
Mr. Grossman, you mentioned the ISAC, I think. One area
that you all didn't talk about, the coordination, is in
commercial space. We have been hearing a lot about these
billionaire joy rides to outer space, but we know that is an
important industry, it can help us take products up to the
space station, or launch satellites, so a good potential use
there. And there are a variety of companies that are starting
to get into this. And I think that that increases the potential
for cyber threats.
I wonder if you could talk about how these ISACs work; if
you are looking at cyber threats, how we coordinate with the
commercial space industry.
Mr. Grossman. Congresswoman, thank you for your question.
Unfortunately, that doesn't fall under my purview.
However, I understand FAA's Office of Commercial Space
Transportation is heavily involved in the development of the
space cybersecurity policies and assisted the development of
the ISAC and the space policy directive. That directive
established key cybersecurity principles to guide and serve as
a foundation for the U.S. approach to cyber protection of space
systems.
I could certainly follow up with you, though, to get more
information on your question, if you would like.
Ms. Titus. Well, I would appreciate that, because I realize
it is not directly under what you do, but you do a lot of
things all around that area, and I think it is something that
is worth bringing to the attention of the committee, because it
is going to become increasingly at issue, as we do more of this
private space adventures, I guess.
I would ask Ms. Newhouse--I know you were instrumental in
setting up the whole PreCheck program, so you are very informed
on how this works, and you got it off the ground, and we have
seen it expand now. The line for PreCheck is longer than the
regular line, I think.
But one of the things that we have heard in areas that
are--rural communities, is that they have a hard time actually
coming in person to get the PreCheck clearance, so there is
some attempt to move to remote applications. Could you talk
about that, and how that data that could be collected remotely
can also be protected?
And do you need legislation for that, or is it something
you can just do internally, or through regulation?
Ms. Newhouse. Thank you for your question, Congresswoman,
and thank you very much for your support of the TSA PreCheck
program. We greatly appreciate the insights that Congress and
all of our stakeholders give us on a daily basis.
I can say, at a very high level, I do know that the office
that runs that program for TSA has endeavored to expand
enrollment capabilities, as you mentioned, Congresswoman, and
we are actually in progress of bringing on additional contract
support, different vendors to do that in a secure manner.
I am happy to get back to you and your staff with specific
answers to those questions on how we are best requiring
protection of that information, and how we will oversee that
information. Thank you.
Ms. Titus. Thank you. I would appreciate that. So much of
our information is shared in an airport, whether it is through
TSA, or just plugging in while you are waiting for your flight,
or even on the flight itself.
So, I think that, to be sure that this is all secure,
information in the screening process--because the trip begins
when you get out of the car at the airport. We want that to all
work well, and we want people to feel secure that that
information can't be compromised. So, I look forward to getting
that from you.
And I will yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Ms. Davids of Kansas [presiding]. The gentlewoman yields
back. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Weber for 5 minutes.
Mr. Weber. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I appreciate that.
I want to talk a minute about pipelines. I appreciated Garret
Graves's comments about ports, and we will tie these together.
As you all know, the Colonial Pipeline system was hacked
into--I think it was May of this year. It was down for 4 or 5
days. It feeds the Southeastern United States, moves about 2\1/
2\ million barrels of product a day, which is gasoline and jet
fuel, diesel, extremely important to our infrastructure,
obviously, energy infrastructure; we would argue national
security infrastructure, because we are going to need fuel to
move our military stuff.
The Keystone Pipeline comes into our district, it is about
one-third [inaudible] without any redundancy of the Keystone
Pipeline, or more pipeline security stuff--and many of you all
probably know pipelines have a 99-percent safety rating
[inaudible] all that [inaudible] with them. They move product
the most efficiently and the most safely. All that to say that,
from an energy perspective, with vulnerability of being hacked,
would it sound like we ought to have a system in place to
notify either pipeline operators--I would add ports to it, like
Congressman Graves did, as well as other ways that we move
energy.
Since we have limited time--and I know we talked about
doing it at cyber speed, so to speak, but should there be a
process in place to where the greatest amount of energy is
protected as early on as possible? I don't know. Is that
possible?
Mr. Schachter, I go to you. Is that something that sounds,
number one, a good idea; and, number two, possible?
Mr. Schachter. Thank you for that question. If I understand
it correctly, we are talking about coordination and
communication between the private-sector partners that provide
the energy, the fuels, the pipeline operators, as well as the
Government, in its regulatory capacity.
Mr. Weber. Correct.
Mr. Schachter. I believe TSA----
Mr. Weber. And with ports--let me also say ports, too,
because, you know, our country runs on--the economy of our
country, it is important, runs on trade. So, let's not leave
the ports out.
Mr. Schachter. OK. So the same principles will apply in my
answer, thank you.
Mr. Weber. Right.
Mr. Schachter. TSA has moved aggressively to improve
information sharing and incident reporting from all of those
private-sector actors, and to coordinate with both DOT and
other Government regulatory bodies that have an interest in
those areas.
As you probably know, ports, as well as the pipelines, are
also privately operated, so that we have to work with those
private-sector partners, and try to influence them and advise
them to improve their own cybersecurity practices to protect
their systems, so that they are less likely to be attacked.
Some of that is standard IT access control, but it also moves
into operational technology, which are very specialized, and
outside the realm of DOT information technology.
Mr. Weber. But if we had a system to catch that--I know we
monitor a lot of stuff--and be able to communicate that as
quickly as possible--I know there was some discussion about
banks here a while--some years back since I've been in
Congress--same thing.
But if we had a system in place where we could at least be
a--I don't know what the right term is--co-managing partner, or
have a process--I am going to move on to the admiral next--
whereby, if we know something is in the making, we can alert
them as quickly as possible, and thereby protect our
infrastructure, in terms of energy, national security, and the
marketplace, if you will, Admiral, what do you think? Sounds
like a good idea?
Admiral Mauger. Congressman, intelligence and understanding
what is happening to the threat level is really a critical
piece of how we collectively protect the Nation.
And so, we have established procedures by which we can
share information rapidly, both through the interagency, down
to our field units, and, in several cases, with the private
sector, through our Area Maritime Security Committees.
What we are also finding out, though, is that this is a
very broad problem. And so, it is important that we get
together and collaborate at the lowest level possible. CISA has
established a Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative that is
bringing private sector and the interagency together at a low
level to be able to see those threats and challenges as they
evolve, and share those out rapidly, and put the mitigations in
place. And so, this is an important issue, and we are getting
after it.
Mr. Weber. Well, thank you for that.
And Madam Chair, I cannot see the clock. How much time do I
have left?
Ms. Davids of Kansas. The gentleman's time has expired.
Mr. Weber. Well, let me just end with one quick thing for
Ms. Newhouse, for the TSA.
If you can prevent the random disappearance of my wife's
TSA number on her airline tickets, it would be worth everything
to me in Congress.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Weber. I appreciate what you all----
Ms. Newhouse. Congressman, we are happy to help. If you
have any questions, or any Members here have questions about
TSA PreCheck or your family members, please let me know, and I
am happy to make sure we solve any issues. Thank you.
Mr. Weber. Thank you so much.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I yield back.
Ms. Davids of Kansas. Thank you. The gentleman yields back.
Ms. Brownley is now recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. Brownley. Thank you, Madam Chair. My first question is
to Mr. Dorsey.
Mr. Dorsey, in October your office issued a disturbing
report about IT security weaknesses at the Federal Motor
Carrier Safety Administration. You placed malware in the
network, and the agency failed to detect it.
So, I was curious to know, is this a practice that you do
in other agencies? Why was this particular agency selected for
this exercise? I am sort of curious of the thought process
behind it.
Mr. Dorsey. Thank you very much, Congresswoman, for your
question.
Throughout our reviews on an annual basis, we have issued a
number of audits with respect to our vulnerability assessments
and penetration testing work of the Department's IT
infrastructure to determine whether or not the Department has
established secure practices to protect and secure its IT
infrastructure.
Our review of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration was not our first review of the Department's IT
infrastructure. As a matter of fact, it was the third review.
We initially started back in 2016, and issued a report on Volpe
Center, the Department's research arm, and we followed that up
with a review of the Department's MARAD association. And
Federal Motor Carriers was just the third in a series of
reviews that we are planning to do with respect to assessing
the Department's security posture at all of its operating
administrations. We just initiated another review of the
Federal Highway Administration's IT infrastructure.
And what we are doing that for is to determine whether or
not the Department is instituting the proper controls,
enforcing oversight of their own policies that they have in
place, where we have identified, primarily, persistent security
weaknesses that has provided us with a path to actually
compromise the Department's IT infrastructure.
Ms. Brownley. Did the Federal Highway Administration fare
better?
Mr. Dorsey. We just initiated that review. We normally take
about 7 to 10 months to complete our review, and we will be
reporting out on the status of that review at that time.
But what we have found in the past is just, primarily,
persistent weaknesses in basic things, such as lack of strong
passwords, unpatched or what we consider to be software that is
not updated in various operating systems. We find a lack of
encryption in data. And those persistent weaknesses are how we,
primarily, were able to penetrate the Department's IT
infrastructure.
Ms. Brownley. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Schachter, I know you have only been in the
Department--in your opening comments you said you have been
there for 3 months. Certainly, 11 years in the city of New
York.
And I guess, you know, I would just like to ask you, what
grade would you give yourself at this particular point? Would
it be an A, a B, a C, a D, an F? How would you grade yourself
right now?
Mr. Schachter. Well, thank you for the question. I don't
have enough information yet to provide that sort of an
assessment.
What I can tell you, and as Mr. Dorsey mentioned, some of
those audit findings do go back to 2016, before DOT created a
central operating environment for the purpose of addressing,
across DOT, some of the very same findings that OIG found in
multiple modes related to access control, vulnerability in
patch management. That the common operating environment gives
us much better tools to provide that security across all the
modes at DOT who use this common operating environment.
So, our performance has already improved, but we have a
ways to go. And we are transparently acknowledging that, as I
did in my opening statement.
Ms. Brownley. And----
Mr. Schachter. And I think, as--pardon me?
Ms. Brownley. Well, I just wanted to go on to another
question, because I only have a few more seconds left.
Mr. Schachter. Sure.
Ms. Brownley. So, you have also mentioned limited resources
several times in your answers today. And so, I am wondering, do
you have enough resources to do what you think you need to do?
And, if not, are you planning on making further budget
requests in the 2023 budget cycle?
Mr. Schachter. Thank you for that question, as well. I am
still too new to the position to fully assess whether we have
sufficient resources, as needed to address this, or the
resources in the right place, or with the right expertise. And
I expect, before too long, to be able to share that
information.
Ms. Brownley. Thank you, sir. My time is up.
Madam Chair, I yield back.
Ms. Davids of Kansas. Thank you. The gentlewoman yields
back. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Burchett for 5 minutes.
Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Chairlady. This is for Rear
Admiral Mauger.
How do you say your name, sir? Is it Mauger or Mauger?
Admiral Mauger. It is Mauger, Congressman, thank you.
Mr. Burchett. All right, all right. And you can call me
Tim. Semper paratus, I believe, is your all's motto, if I am
correct.
I am really concerned about the Russian efforts to target
the undersea fiber optic cables that carry 99 percent of U.S.
communications abroad, many of which are operated by private
companies.
I understand that a lot of information about our undersea
cable system is classified, but, given the Coast Guard's role
in protecting the Marine Transportation System, can you comment
on our Nation's ability to prevent and respond to cyberattacks
against our undersea cable infrastructure?
Admiral Mauger. Congressman, our maritime transportation
critical infrastructure is varied, and it is dependent on other
modes of critical infrastructure.
And, as you have highlighted, there are very substantial
threats against the maritime critical infrastructure every day.
And so that is why we have put together an--that is why we have
operationalized our cybersecurity and made it part of our
prevention and response framework, to make sure that we are
getting after this threat at the speed and pace at which it
demands.
I can offer you a followup brief with regard to cables, if
you would like, sir.
Mr. Burchett. I would really like that.
Just out of curiosity, how many ribbons are on your chest?
[Laughter.]
Admiral Mauger. Congressman, actually, I don't even know
how many ribbons are on my chest here, so----
Mr. Burchett. That is very----
Admiral Mauger. Maybe I can get you that answer for the
record.
Mr. Burchett. That is all right. No, it is very
distracting, but I think it is pretty cool. Thank you, brother,
for serving our country.
I will always remember a buddy of mine, Ron Eisenberg, back
home, who is a Coastie, and I always remember at the Veterans
Day celebration, that everybody gets up and sings their Service
anthems, or whatever, and my daddy was an old Marine Corps--so
he would sing the Marine Corps hymn. And there is always just
one Coastie in all of Knox County that would get up and sing,
and he would just scream it out in the back, because he would
be by himself. And I always thought that was pretty cool. But
thank you.
Hey, this is for Ms. Newhouse at the TSA. I won't get after
you for the terrible service sometimes I see people get,
because in Knoxville, Tennessee, actually, the group is pretty
good. I always gripe about the one up here, in DC, which is, in
my opinion, pretty lackluster.
But a couple of months ago the TSA announced plans to issue
new cybersecurity regulations for rail and airline companies.
Now, how much time did your all's agency give the impacted
stakeholders to respond and provide feedback on those
directives?
Ms. Newhouse. Thank you, Congressman. And thank you for
recognizing our fine transportation security officers,
particularly in Tennessee. We are very proud of them, and they
are, frankly, amongst our top-performing airports and officers
in the country. So, thank you for that compliment.
With respect to the rail and higher risk rail and rail
transit directives, along with the aviation security program
changes, actually, we have followed a very robust rubric of
engagement. I will give you an example. For aviation, we
utilize existing security requirements and programs, and
provided ample notice and comment, both verbally and in writing
in multiple sessions.
And we have also, as I mentioned in my opening to
Congressman Crawford, we have taken that feedback and updated
definitions of a reportable cybersecurity incident. So, we have
taken that seriously.
With respect to my rail partners, as I mentioned earlier in
my testimony, we have embarked on a robust engagement at the
CEO level, starting with Secretary Mayorkas, Administrator
Pekoske, amongst many other DHS senior officials along with our
CISA partners, to engage both at the classified level and the
unclassified level to describe the known, ongoing, and
persistent threats that are driving these policies.
We then provided written copies to the regulated parties to
have an opportunity to review these, albeit in certain
circumstances we do need to act swiftly, given the persistent
threat. However, what we have done, and particularly over this
last month, I can personally tell you from my office, the
standpoint, we have engaged extensively over these last 4 weeks
and have been updated, based on those feedbacks, particularly
from our rail partners. Thank you.
Mr. Burchett. Has your agency received any concerns from
the stakeholders about how the upcoming cybersecurity
directives would impact their current operations?
Ms. Newhouse. Thank you, Congressman. Yes. Everything we do
every day is about continuous improvement, and one of those
areas of continuous improvement is to, first, do no harm and,
actually, complement operations while securing those
operations.
So, we have heard a number of concerns to ensure that all
operators, large and small, can apply these cybersecurity
measures in an effective and efficient manner. So, we do take
that into consideration, and we continue to solicit feedback.
We are not just done when we issue the documents. It is a
continuous feedback loop and improvement.
Mr. Burchett. Thank----
Ms. Newhouse. And we stand committed to that.
Mr. Burchett. Thank you. I have run out of time.
And I yield none of my time back to you, Chairlady. Thank
you.
Ms. Davids of Kansas. The gentleman yields. The Chair now
recognizes Mr. Payne for 5 minutes.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, Madam Chair.
And Ms. Newhouse, I am going to contact you outside of this
hearing with some respects to PreCheck at Newark International
Airport. I received some documents from flyers that flew into
Newark that had an issue with the PreCheck. But I will do that
at a later time.
Under the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, Congress
mandated railroads that carried hazardous materials and
passengers to install Positive Train Control systems. Positive
Train Control systems work to prevent unsafe movements and
accidents by using an information network to regulate trains'
positions.
Can you elaborate on the new TSA directive concerning
cybersecurity in passenger and freight rail?
And how will this directive help secure PTC systems?
Ms. Newhouse. Thank you for your question, Congressman, and
we look forward to receiving the inquiry regarding TSA
PreCheck. We are happy to help.
With respect to the new rail security directives--and we
have just worked with our partners to implement--it really--
with respect to Positive Train Control and any other
operational or informational technology systems, those
directives apply to all of it.
And, if I may, we have focused very heavily on reporting.
We have to know what--even anything that could, really,
reasonably impact those operations, whether it is PTC or other
IT or OT systems. So, the early warning and indicators are
critical. So, that is part of the strategy with these new
directives, is to designate that coordinator, have a 24/7
availability to report those incidents to CISA.
As Admiral Mauger mentioned, CISA has a--what we call a
clearinghouse. This is central. In addition to multiple--and we
don't forestall any other reporting requirements, or reporting
channels that operators may have to independent operating
agencies, but CISA is central, CISA is the center of the United
States Government--to maintain that information, and
disseminate it fast. It can go at the national level down to
the local level.
Again, with respect to any IT and OT system, we are
requiring these rail operators to develop a cybersecurity
incident response plan. We are working with them. We are doing
that in concert with all of the modal administrations at DOT.
We want to make sure that our folks in the field, as you are
well familiar with them, have that information, and have that
at hand.
Mr. Payne. Yes----
Ms. Newhouse. Back to--we are asking the operators to
conduct self-assessments, and identify vulnerabilities and
gaps, and have us help them close those gaps. Thank you.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
Mr. Marinos, good cyber hygiene is critical to keeping our
cyber transportation infrastructure safe and operational.
Federal agencies must not be exempt from adhering to cyber
hygiene standards.
As chairman of the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous
Materials Subcommittee, I have a responsibility to ensure that
the Federal Railroad Administration meets the evolving threat
of cyberattacks. How can Congress better assist agencies such
as FRA to develop and keep good cyber hygiene practices?
Mr. Marinos. Congressman Payne, I think the best method of
doing that is your continued support of the inspectors general
community, as well as to GAO and the audits that we conduct. It
is extremely helpful, and productive, in particular to have
Congress' support, not only during our audits, but also
following them, when it comes to recommendations that we have
made. And so, we are grateful for that support.
I think the important thing when it comes to, in
particular, smaller entities, is to ensure that those
departments and agencies that they are part of have the
capability to monitor the performance themselves. And likewise,
at the more central level, OMB and the Federal CIO and Federal
CISA offices are doing everything they can to, likewise, give
feedback to big and small agencies in what they need to do to
get better at cybersecurity.
Mr. Payne. Well, I thank you for that answer.
And, Madam Chair, I will yield back.
Ms. Davids of Kansas. I thank you, the gentleman yields
back. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Balderson for 5 minutes.
Mr. Balderson. Thank you, Madam Chair. My first question is
to Mr. Grossman.
Mr. Grossman, good morning, first of all. Last year, the
GAO offered six recommendations to the FAA to strengthen its
avionics cybersecurity oversight program. The GAO report found
that evolving cyber threats and increasing connectivity between
airplanes and other systems could put future flight safety at
risk if the FAA doesn't prioritize oversight.
Can you discuss what the FAA is doing to ensure these
networks and systems are secure from cyber threats?
Mr. Grossman. Good morning, or good afternoon, Congressman,
thank you for the question.
Yes, FAA looks at, really, at the whole system of the
airplane, once avionics equipment is installed, to assure that
there is proper procedures and protections.
The avionics GAO audit that you referenced, the GAO issued
six recommendations. We have already proposed closure on two of
those. Three of those are scheduled for closure in March. And
just one we have not concurred with. So, we welcomed that
audit, and made some significant changes.
Mr. Balderson. OK, thank you. One of the recommendations
that the GAO made, which the FAA did not concur with, was to
consider revising its policies and procedures for periodic
independent testing. Can you discuss why the FAA disagreed with
this recommendation?
Mr. Grossman. Absolutely, sir. It was independent testing
on aircraft that are currently flying in the fleet today, and
we were concerned that independent testing--or penetration
testing is how we had discussed with the GAO--on aircraft that
are in the fleet, that are active aircraft, could leave
residual damage to the avionics systems, affecting safety.
Mr. Balderson. OK, thank you. And I have one more followup
for you: Has the FAA developed an avionics cybersecurity
training program?
Mr. Grossman. An avionics cybersecurity training program?
Mr. Balderson. Yes.
Mr. Grossman. I am not aware of what we have developed, but
I can certainly look into that and get back to you.
Mr. Balderson. Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
Mr. Marinos, thank you for joining us this afternoon. In
December of 2020, GAO reported that none of the 23 agencies in
its review had fully implemented key foundational practices for
managing information in communications technology supply
chains.
Since 2010, GAO has made nearly 80 recommendations to
enhance infrastructure cybersecurity. As of November, nearly 50
of those recommendations have not been implemented.
While we don't have time to go over all of these
recommendations, could you please discuss which of these
unimplemented recommendations should be given priority?
Mr. Marinos. Yes, Congressman. I appreciate you pointing
out the importance of the recommendations that we have
outstanding.
In addition to the recommendations that we made within that
specific avionics report that you mentioned earlier in your
questioning, I believe that the top recommendations with
respect to critical infrastructure include making sure that
Federal agencies that have sector-specific responsibilities are
doing everything they can to assess what the cyber risks are to
their respective sectors; put forward plans with stakeholder
engagement that makes sense on how they are going to support
those sectors; and then execute.
To put it very carefully, most of those recommendations
really expressed that in a variety of different ways across
sectors that extend beyond transportation to include things
like the grid, K through 12, financial services, and other
sectors, as well.
We also think it is very important for CISA to continue its
effort to reach its full potential. When Congress passed a law
in 2018 establishing CISA, the agency that grew out of NPPD
took on a large set of activities that it had challenged itself
to complete by the end of 2020.
Unfortunately, a report that we issued earlier this year
showed that they were not able to achieve quite a few of the
important activities related to workforce planning, incident
response, identifying essential functions. These are activities
that CISA needs to complete as quickly as possible, and we have
heard from CISA that there is intent to do many of those
things, either by the end of this year or next. The urgency is
there for that organization to gain its full potential to be
able to provide support, both to infrastructure and to Federal
agencies, as well.
Mr. Balderson. OK, thank you very much.
Madam Chair, I yield back.
Ms. Davids of Kansas. The gentleman yields back. The Chair
now recognizes Mr. Malinowski for 5 minutes.
[Pause.]
Ms. Davids of Kansas. It looks like Mr. Malinowski might
not be on.
Mr. Carter, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Thank you, Madam Chair. I greatly
appreciate the opportunity. Thank you so much to our
participants.
Mr. Marinos and Mr. Dorsey, both of your organizations have
provided a lot of oversight of Federal Government cybersecurity
strengths and weaknesses. Have either of your organizations
looked at how prepared or vulnerable agencies are to potential
cybersecurity attacks, specifically around the time of natural
disasters?
As you know, my district in Louisiana suffered a
substantial storm, one of the largest ever. And my fear is, as
we know, that hurricanes come every year, the intensity
increases, and my fear is that our critical infrastructure is
particularly vulnerable during those periods.
Can you share with me your thoughts on ideas and/or
practices to protect our critical infrastructure during natural
disasters?
Mr. Marinos. Yes, I would be happy to, Congressman. And I
think that you noted in the previous hearing that the National
Association of State CIOs had also identified that as a real
threat. And so, I think it does speak to just how important it
is to consider, not only when we can be strong at our most
resilient state, but also at our weakest points, which can come
often with natural disasters.
What I would say is, over the course of the last several
decades, GAO has been tasked by Congress to look specifically
at how Federal agencies are preparing themselves for man-made
or natural disasters through continuity of operations
activities. And a key part of continuity planning is to ensure
the continual availability of information, and you can't do
that without thinking about cybersecurity, as well. I think
that is probably a very important part of looking at any
cybersecurity program at a Federal agency, is its ability to
recover from disasters.
I am not sure if Mr. Dorsey may have more specific DOT-
related examples to provide, but I am happy to pass it over to
him.
Mr. Dorsey. Thank you for the question, Congressman. And
thank you, GAO.
I just wanted to say that we have just recently initiated a
review of the Department's high-value assets. And what we found
is that the Department's high-value assets program is heavily
reliant on the Department of Homeland Security efforts to work
with the Department in assessing the Department's high-value
assets.
The Department has identified 21 high-value assets. From
our understanding, there have been at least four assessments
since the Department of Homeland Security has actually
initiated its review of DOT's programs, and we are planning to
continue our work over the next several months to determine
what the actual governance process is that the Department has
in place, as well as whether or not they are actually taking
the initial steps required to assess and remediate the
potential for a threat of any of those high-value assets. And--
--
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. How do you disseminate that
information with local governments or States, so that they are
equipped for future instances?
I understand you guys have several practices or studies
that are ongoing, trying to determine best practices. How do
you disseminate information so local governments are prepared,
are better prepared?
Mr. Dorsey. Our job is primarily to report directly to the
department heads, as well as Congress. And how that information
is disseminated down to the State and local level, I don't
have----
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Mr. Marinos, could you respond to
that, sir?
Mr. Marinos. Yes, sir. I think that falls on the shoulders
of CISA. We have seen CISA develop its capabilities, especially
when it comes to the support it can provide to State and local
governments, and to owners and operators that may not have
capabilities to do things like assess their own capabilities.
Those are offerings and services that CISA has.
One thing that we have seen is an important need for CISA
to continue its outreach across the board, whether they are big
or small operators, so that there is awareness about what the
Federal Government can do ahead of time, so that it can prepare
itself to be resilient in the event of a situation like you
describe, where natural disaster may coincide with a
cyberattack.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. It would be very helpful if you
would share with us information that we might be able to share
with our local governments and States on what to do in the case
of hurricanes or wildfires.
You can imagine the devastation if someone took control of
our apparatus, and we were not able to dispatch emergency EMS
or fire equipment. These are real-life issues that,
unfortunately, are becoming far too frequently experienced with
local and State governments.
So, thank you very much for your time and attention. Any
information that you can share with us on how we, as a
committee, can do better, or push buttons further to provide
resources or awareness so this information is gotten out, and
we are able to be prepared for future instances, as we know,
unfortunately, they are becoming far too common.
I yield back, thank you.
Mr. Auchincloss [presiding]. The gentleman yields. The
Chair recognizes Mr. Fitzpatrick for 5 minutes.
Mr. Fitzpatrick. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Ms. Newhouse, thank you for being with us today. When the
Colonial Pipeline suffered their ransomware attack in May, we
saw the grave impacts on our Nation and our infrastructure.
TSA's directives to require reporting and incident report plans
were needed.
In 2020, the average estimated time to identify a breach
was over 200 days.
So, my question, first question, is what more is being done
by your agency to identify cyberattacks in a quicker fashion?
Ms. Newhouse. Thank you for your support and your question,
Congressman.
Actually, with respect to those security directives to the
pipeline industry, we require reporting of the incidents within
12 hours. And that is because of the criticality of our
Nation's pipelines, the fact that they carry the majority of--
the significant effects that it would have if those were
attacked, because they carry the majority of the resources
needed to run this country. So that is why we were very
forward-leaning in establishing that immediate timeframe. And
we have since also updated that definition, as I have
mentioned, of what is a reportable cybersecurity incident, in
collaboration with industry.
Mr. Fitzpatrick. Secondly, it has been found that well over
80 percent of breaches are financially motivated, and the
average ransomware payment rose over one-third in 2020, from
2019 levels, to over $100,000.
Do you believe that American companies should continue to
pay ransoms to bad actors?
And if not, do you think that legislation would be needed
to, basically, disincentivize or, if not, ban and make illegal
ransom payments altogether, and have more of a Federal program
to address that?
Ms. Newhouse. As referenced earlier, CISA Director Easterly
referenced ransomware as likely the highest level of malicious
cyber activity.
I would say that, through the Department of Homeland
Security, and CISA in particular, we work very closely with our
law enforcement, the FBI, both Federal and State and local law
enforcement, to identify those opportunities.
I would defer to my CISA colleagues on how we can best
combat ransomware from a technical standpoint, in addition to
the financial aspects, as well. I am happy to take that back
and coordinate that for you, Congressman.
Mr. Fitzpatrick. Thank you, Ms. Newhouse.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Auchincloss. The Chair recognizes Ms. Bourdeaux for a
period of 5 minutes.
Ms. Bourdeaux. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.
We have all seen the far-reaching negative implications of
cybersecurity attacks on the transportation sector. For
example, in May of 2021, the ransomware attack on the Colonial
Pipeline resulted in more than 43 percent of gas stations in my
home State of Georgia being out of gas.
It is clear from today's testimony that more work needs to
be done to strengthen cybersecurity protections in all areas of
the transportation sector.
Mr. Grossman, in your written testimony you talk about the
value of training through participation exercises or
simulations. My district is home to Curiosity Lab at Peachtree
Corners, which is a one-of-a-kind living lab designed to
provide a real-world test environment to advance next
generation intelligence, mobility, and smart city technology.
What kind of simulations do you run to prepare your staff
for cybersecurity attacks?
And could you talk a little bit about the benefits of those
real-life simulations?
Mr. Grossman. Absolutely, Congresswoman, thank you very
much for that question.
As I mentioned in my oral testimony, as well, we have
developed a cyber test facility in Atlantic City at our William
J. Hughes Technical Center that serves as kind of the
cornerstone of some of our exercise activities. We regularly
conduct incident response exercises that include both the
mission support side, or the normal, IT side of FAA, as well as
the operational side, or the NAS, the National Airspace System.
In addition to that, we conduct external exercises with DHS
and all of Government. There are cyber exercises.
We have also conducted international exercises with the
Caribbean, with Mexico, and several other countries. This year,
we have begun looking at cyber ranges, so that we can actually
inject real-world cybersecurity threat into our exercises, so
that we can get an actual look at what an actual attack would
look like.
Typically, when we simulated exercise, it is just the
data----
[Audio malfunction.]
Ms. Bourdeaux. Might have lost----
Mr. Grossman. Yes, I am sorry.
Ms. Bourdeaux. Yes, I might have lost you for a second
there.
Mr. Grossman. I apologize.
Ms. Bourdeaux. OK. So just to follow up with that, Mr.
Schachter at the DOT, are there similar types of exercises that
you do that you could talk a little about, and what the value
add is of having that kind of real-life simulation?
Mr. Schachter. Well, thank you for that question, because
it gives me an opportunity to discuss, actually, one of the
most effective and least expensive type of simulation
exercises, and that is one where we send, essentially, a test
email encouraging people to click on an unknown link, a
technique called phishing.
And what we see is, by repeating that on a regular basis,
people get much smarter, and become much more cautious about
clicking on those links. And, as was mentioned a little while
ago, this is a prime way that malware gets introduced into
enterprise environments unknowingly by people within the
organization.
So, this is a, as I said, a very effective, very
inexpensive means of protecting the network, and providing
greater access control.
Ms. Bourdeaux. Thank you very much. I yield back the
balance of my time.
Mr. Auchincloss. The Chair recognizes Mr. Mast for a period
of 5 minutes.
Mr. Mast. Thank you.
Admiral, I would love to start with you. Number one, thank
you for your service in the United States Coast Guard. I very
much appreciate that. I want to talk a little bit about this.
If your men and women are physically attacked, do they
return fire?
Admiral Mauger. Congressman, we have a well-established,
well-rehearsed, well-trained process in place for use of force
in the Coast Guard. It is not my area of expertise. And so, if
you want to go into that in more detail, I would be happy to
take that question for the record or set up a briefing for you.
Mr. Mast. Not a lot of detail, just logically and
commonsensically, if somebody points the muzzle of a rifle at
one of your men or women, and depresses the trigger, and moves
around at a couple thousand feet per second towards one of your
men and women, are they going to return fire?
Admiral Mauger. Congressman, they will execute the Coast
Guard use of force policy, and so, if fired on by an adversary,
they will fire back.
Mr. Mast. That is right. Like I said, that is not meant to
be provocative, right? It is common sense that they will.
Again, understanding you are not a shooter by your own
admission, do you think that they should shoot until they
totally eliminate the threat? Just opinion, I am looking for
opinion on this. I understand you are not a shooter.
Admiral Mauger. Congressman, I think that, in the general
sense, our folks need to ensure their own personal protection,
and for the protection of their colleagues, and ensure the
protection of any members of the public as well. And so, they
will carry out and continue with the use of force policy until
that local Coast Guard's women or men is sure that things are
safe.
Mr. Mast. And we should dispatch the threats, in my
opinion, and I have been a part of doing that in a different
place.
And I want to layer this on cyberattacks and cyber threats.
And the reason that I asked that was to go and layer that on
this question: Should we approach a cyberattack in the same way
that we would approach a physical attack? Should we go out
there?
There is a moment that it turns from defending myself to
going out there and seeking a violent course of action to
dispatch the threat that is coming against me. And it becomes
offensive, and that is not provocative.
Should we be pursuing that in every instance of being shot
at in the form of cyber, that we dispatch that threat so that
it can never again pose that threat to us again?
Admiral Mauger. So, Congressman, as we move this into the
cyber landscape, it is really important to understand that
there are key differences.
There is a big difference between attributing a shooter
right in front of you, using force against you that you can see
and react to, versus somebody in the cyberspace that might be
working through a different adversary, or he might be working
through a different venue to get after you. So, attribution in
cyberspace is really critical.
That said, the Coast Guard released a cyber strategic
outlook in August that puts together three lines of effort: the
first line of effort is about defending and operating our
networks and DoD networks; the second one is about protecting
the maritime transportation system, and we bring together the
full spectrum of the prevention and response framework to
protect the maritime transportation system; and then the
third----
Mr. Mast. Do you----
Admiral Mauger [continuing]. Element is----
Mr. Mast. Do you believe in making that transition,
however, from we were attacked, we are now assessing what
happened from the attack, and we are now transitioning to
offensive, to eliminate where we assess the origin of that
threat?
If you can assess the origin of that threat, do you believe
in becoming offensive against that threat?
Admiral Mauger. Congressman, we are building, with support
from Congress in fiscal year 2021, and with support from the
administration in the fiscal year 2022 President's budget, we
are building out a cyber mission team capability that allows us
to take full spectrum operations, provided that we have the
right authorities in place, against adversaries.
And so----
Mr. Mast. So, that is a yes.
Admiral Mauger [continuing]. It is an important part----
Mr. Mast. The full spectrum, meaning----
Admiral Mauger. It is an important part of our strategy.
Mr. Mast. Full spectrum, meaning yes, you believe you
should have that capability to transition to the offensive
against where you believe a threat originated from.
Admiral Mauger. Congressman, that is the key part of our
three lines of effort and our strategic outlook. We are
aligning our training under the joint DoD standards, so that we
can work closely with the Department of Defense to carry out
what the Nation needs from their forces.
Mr. Mast. Very good.
Mr. Auchincloss. The gentleman's time has expired.
Mr. Mast. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Auchincloss. The Chair recognizes himself for 5
minutes.
Last month, we heard from industries on real-world
challenges they face, and I look forward to speaking with our
witnesses today on how the Federal Government can work with its
private-sector partners to protect and strengthen our digital
infrastructure, as well.
This question is for, first, Mr. Dorsey, and then Mr.
Marinos, in that order, please.
My district in Massachusetts has two leaders, at least, in
the cybersecurity industry. Industrial Defender is
headquartered in Foxborough, Massachusetts, and CyberArk in
Newton. These companies work on security roadmaps and software
to protect complex operational technology in line with NIST
compliance.
Has the DOT Inspector General's Office and/or the GAO
looked at how Federal agencies are interacting with companies
like these, and local transportation agencies?
And do you have any recommendations for improving public-
private coordination and cooperation?
And these questions are first for Mr. Dorsey, and then for
Mr. Marinos.
Mr. Dorsey. Thank you for your question, Congressman. The
Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General has
not looked at that line of coordination, if you will.
But what I will say is that, as part of our annual
assessments through FEMA, we do work with the Department, and
ask them a series of questions from the standpoint of a supply
chain, a risk management area. And what we do with that line of
reasoning is just to go back and determine whether or not the
Department has taken appropriate steps with respect to ensuring
that any vendor-related software that they get is not
associated with any type of counterfeit efforts, or anything
like that.
And we also make a determination as to what extent does DOT
ensure that products, system components, systems, and services
of external providers are consistent with DOT cybersecurity
policy. That is a new requirement that just has been
incorporated in the IT system metrics that we have to assess on
an annual basis.
Outside of that, that is how we go about communicating with
the OMB, as well as how we report to Congress with respect to
what the Department's efforts are in that particular arena.
Thank you.
Mr. Auchincloss. Mr. Marinos?
Mr. Marinos. Yes. So, Congressman, two thoughts here.
One, GAO was tasked by law to evaluate the adequacy of
standards that the National Institute of Standards and
Technology puts out. So NIST. And the biggest one in this area
is the cybersecurity framework.
And as part of the four reviews--we are actually wrapping
up the fourth just in the next few months--we looked at how
this cyber framework was pulled together, including what kind
of engagement NIST had in doing a public exposure draft, and
receiving comments from outside stakeholders, and then
incorporating them into the framework. They have done this on a
couple of iterations of the framework, and they, of course, do
it on other special publications, as well.
So, we may not necessarily interact directly with
organizations like those that you mentioned, but we certainly
evaluate how NIST is taking in information from folks out
there, the experts out there on cybersecurity, and whether they
can use that to better the framework and the guidance that is
being put out.
And then the second thing I just mentioned too, though, is
that GAO does engage quite often with State and local audit
offices, including the Massachusetts State Auditor's Office, as
well. And that has been a really great opportunity, because it
gives us a chance to have a better sense of how effective
Federal guidance is within their capacity, and what are sort of
the threats and the landscape that they are also seeing State
and local agencies have to combat, as well.
Mr. Auchincloss. Thank you to you both. The Chair yields
the balance of his time and recognizes Mr. Johnson for 5
minutes.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Mr. Chairman, are you talking
about Mr. Johnson of South Dakota?
Mr. Auchincloss. Yes, sorry.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Very good. No, not a problem.
All right, well, I will start with Mr. Grossman.
And Mr. Grossman, I recently had the opportunity to visit
an air traffic control facility in Sioux Falls just a couple of
weeks ago, and it was fantastic, really dedicated people, for
sure. Sean Hennet and others showed me around. But I couldn't
help but notice how antiquated some of the computer equipment
was. There were some newer systems, but they seemed to be
intermingled with some that were older than many of the folks
working in the tower.
And so, give me some sense, very quickly, of the kind of
challenges that we have keeping these systems safe when they
are so antiquated.
Mr. Grossman. Well, thank you for your question, and I
appreciate your trip.
I think, from a cyber perspective, those systems, while
they appear to be old, we are able to keep them secure. If you
are asking about simply replacing those systems, that is really
not in my area. I would have to take your question back to our
air traffic organization. But from a cybersecurity perspective,
even though they appear old, they are certainly secure.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. OK, very good. I appreciate
that. And maybe I will shift gears now to Mr. Marinos.
I listened with interest when you noted that GAO has made
3,000 recommendations for improving cybersecurity to Federal
agencies, and with even more interest when you noted that there
are more than 900 of them that have not been implemented by
those agencies.
We haven't had a lot of discussion today about dams, which
is under the jurisdiction of this committee. Sir, are you aware
of any particular--and obviously, the dams are critically
important, both from an electrical generation perspective, as
well as a flood control perspective for this country--are you
aware of any particular recommendations that have been made to
the Department of Homeland Security vis-a-vis cybersecurity for
our dam infrastructure that have not been implemented?
Mr. Marinos. Actually, Congressman, sort of building off of
the most recent question that I answered, the NIST
cybersecurity framework, obviously, applies to all sectors. And
so, as part of the work of the series of four reviews we have
done, we have actually gone out to DHS and the other now Sector
Risk Management Agencies, and we have asked them whether their
respective sectors are finding it useful. You know, are they
adopting it?
And so, that would include the dam sector, as well, the
subsector, as well.
And so, in those instances, we have seen that Federal
agencies are challenged, not only within that sector, within
others, to be able to have that kind of dialogue with
operators, big and small, within their respective sectors.
There are a variety of reasons for that.
One, there may simply not be the appropriate expertise at
the operators to be able to interact, to provide that kind of
feedback, even to be able to use the framework in the way that
it is intended. It is a very expansive set of sort of--it is
like--it has been sort of equated to, like, a grocery store.
They can go in and pick and choose the cyber protections that
you might want to implement.
And so, I think the important thing is for DHS to make sure
that it is getting feedback from, not only the dam sector, but
others, to make sure that the support and guidance it is
providing is actually useful.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. So--and I think that is
helpful. But, as you alluded to with your last answer, that is
more comprehensive, right? It is across all impacted agencies.
Does anything in particular stand out with regard--I mean,
we were talking about some of the antiquated IT systems in
place for the FAA. I happen to know that that is also the case
for the operations of the dam systems with Western Area Power
Administration and others. Anything in particular that comes to
mind with that subsector?
Mr. Marinos. Absolutely. And it doesn't just relate to that
specific sector. But, as you point out, legacy systems,
especially with operational technology, are something that
operators need to be thinking about ahead, have a plan for how
they intend to modernize.
And as Larry pointed out, as Mr. Grossman pointed out, many
of those systems may actually have, in some ways, better
protections if they are air-gapped. In other words, if they are
not connected to business systems within those respective
companies, they may be better suited for the sort of
operational control activities that they do.
But the reality is that, again, that connection to the
Federal Government--how do those operators know what the
greatest threats are? That is going to require a good amount of
information sharing, to and from, to kind of know what the
posture is within the dam sector, as an example.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Yes, I think that is well
said, sir.
Has GAO indicated the investment gap--as we talk about
these legacy systems and the need to replace them, has GAO
estimated the size of that gap in dollars and cents?
And could you point me toward a particular report that I
could review to learn more?
Mr. Marinos. I am happy to share information from the
Federal agency side, and maybe that equates to the private
sector. But the Federal Government continues to spend 80
percent of its IT budget on legacy activities, not on
modernizing. And so, I think that is an important aspect, as
well as--as the DOT CIO mentioned--modernizing with security in
mind from the beginning.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Very good. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman, and I yield back.
Mr. Auchincloss. The Chair recognizes Mr. Malinowski for 5
minutes.
Mr. Malinowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to zoom out
a bit--no pun intended--and talk about the future of
transportation, 5, 10, 15 years from now, and get into how the
Department is guarding against new and emerging threats. And
then I want to ask Mr. Schachter for his thoughts, and Mr.
Marinos for his reaction.
I participated a few days ago in a tabletop exercise that
simulated a hostile power taking down our GPS system, something
that obviously would have incredibly dire implications, even
today, for nearly all modes of transportation: air, rail,
maritime, and more.
In the consumer automobile context, some of America's
largest companies--Tesla, Apple, Alphabet--are investing
billions of dollars in autonomous vehicle technology. I was in
a meeting just yesterday with Sundar Pichai, the CEO of
Alphabet, which owns an autonomous driving startup, Waymo, and
he reaffirmed his interest to us in bringing that technology to
the market.
So, while there is no expert consensus on precisely when
there will be widespread adoption of level 4, level 5 autonomy,
I think it is safe to say that we are going to have a huge
number of vehicles on the road, certainly by the 2030s, that
are heavily or even exclusively reliant on artificial
intelligence to make decisions about accelerating, braking,
turning, every road decision. And, in fact, today every car is
rolling off the assembly line packed with computers. Many have
internet-based, internet-enabled entertainment systems that are
pre-installed, and there is even more revolutionary
technological change to come, including, potentially, cars that
are charged by the highways that they drive on themselves.
As all of you know, any product, device, or service that is
connected to the internet, or that is otherwise reliant on
code, is going to be vulnerable, potentially vulnerable, to
compromise. And the stakes are going to be incredibly high when
we are talking about software-powered machines that are
carrying people at 70 miles or more down the freeway.
So, Mr. Schachter, recognizing your primary focus is on the
internal IT management of the Department, that you have only
been on the job for a few months, and you are not personally
writing the regulations related to autonomy or grid safety, I
do want to ask you some big-picture questions about how you and
your colleagues are thinking about the threats that are around
the corner.
What cyber-related challenges does the Department expect to
encounter in 5, 10, 15 years, when the technologies that we are
just talking about today become mainstream?
What is going to keep your successor up at night, and what,
if anything, are you doing now to prepare?
Mr. Schachter. Well, thank you very much for that question.
GPS and overall positioning, navigation, and timing are
very important issues that DOT is studying in multiple places.
The best example I can give you actually relates back to my
experience in New York City, where we were one of the three
national connected vehicle test locations through a Department
of Transportation connected vehicle pilot program.
And securely communicating with all of the test vehicles,
and standing up a security credential management system so that
the vehicles were communicating for basic safety information
like emergency braking, or even a traffic signal phase
warnings, like when you were about to approach a red signal, we
wanted to be sure, and the Federal Government wanted us to be
sure, that all of those transmissions were from authenticated
actors, and nobody was spoofing actors and potentially causing
harm to either the people operating vehicles, or other road
users, as well.
So, that is a future technology that is not so far away,
but certainly demonstrates the issue involved that you are
referencing, that those communications need to be secure, and
we need to know, both on the transmitting and receiving end,
they are from partners we recognize.
Mr. Malinowski. I guess I am out of time. I yield back.
Mr. Auchincloss. The Chair recognizes Miss Gonzalez-Colon
for 5 minutes.
Miss Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you, Mr. Chair. My question will
be to Mr. Larry Grossman. And the question will be--I just want
to bring to attention that the FAA decision to utilize section
804 to consolidate air traffic control operations in Miami for
the Caribbean Basin, which includes Puerto Rico, and San Juan
Airport operates with 1970s technology.
Yet the San Juan Flight Center handles more than 4,000
flights, mostly consistent--all flights, including arrivals,
departures, and overflights for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
Islands, the British Virgin Islands, and overflights from South
America, due to its 400-mile-long airspace, which can take
commercial airlines an hour to transit through. And this is the
same number of flights that Atlanta airspace covers, from
Charlotte to Savannah.
So, my question will be, while I understand that this has
been done to consolidate operations, and for cost savings, my
concern is, what are the assurances that a cyberattack on the
FAA facilities in Miami won't affect air traffic control
operations in Puerto Rico?
And what type of redundancies are put in place for smaller
airports in rural and remote places, should a larger airport's
air traffic control operations be affected by a cyberattack,
considering that we have the international airport, but, as
well, smaller airports around the island?
Mr. Grossman. Well, thank you very much for your question.
I am not, as I am sure you know, I am not responsible
specifically for facilities consolidation.
But from a cyber perspective, the protections that our air
traffic control systems have are virtually identical, whether a
facility is local, or whether it is remote and managed through
our secure communication protocols, which is a service that we
obtain. But that service is the same, whether you are dealing
with a local facility or a remote facility. The security
parameters are the same.
Miss Gonzalez-Colon. Mr. Grossman, you have been talking
about the aviation ecosystem. And with this concept in mind,
what kind of training do airport and air traffic control
workers get on cybersecurity?
Mr. Grossman. Well, I can't speak for airport workers that
are not specifically employees or our contractors, but I can
tell you that all air traffic controllers are required to take
yearly security awareness training, as are all our contract
employees, contract tower employees, et cetera. Employees--go
ahead, sorry.
Miss Gonzalez-Colon. After the first hearing we had on this
topic, some employees last month in the hearing said that they
were conducting personal business on work computers, or even
personal cell phones that exposed the companies they worked for
to cyberattacks. How can we ensure that the same does not
happen in airports around the country, or while airplanes are
in the sky?
Mr. Grossman. Well, I can assure you that there is no
personal business done on any mission-critical system or
service. Individuals' Government-issued workstations that they
get their email on, they are permitted to do limited personal
use, and that is very limited, you know, if someone needed to,
on their break time, log into the bank, or something like that.
Miss Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you.
Mr. Dorsey, if you don't mind, how often does DOT test its
security controls as part of the risk management issues the OIG
identified in 2021?
And what do those tests include?
And do we have any operating agency experience a full
cyberattack with different types of attacks?
Mr. Dorsey. Thank you for the question, Congresswoman.
We assessed the Department's areas in testing cybersecurity
controls based on the NIST cybersecurity framework in five
different areas. We determined whether or not the Department is
adequately testing security controls centered around
identifying and managing risk, protecting its IT systems from a
configuration management standpoint, from a daily access and
management standpoint----
Mr. Auchincloss. The gentlewoman's time has expired.
Miss Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you.
Mr. Dorsey. I will be happy to provide you with an updated
response on the record.
Miss Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you.
Mr. Auchincloss. The Chair recognizes Mr. Carbajal for 5
minutes.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
The shortcomings in our Nation's cybersecurity readiness
are apparent, both in the public and the private sectors, as
evidenced by the cyberattacks this year, including on the
Colonial Pipeline and JBS Foods. We cannot leave ourselves
vulnerable enough to allow bad actors to control essential
infrastructure such as energy supply, water management, supply
chains, and public transit.
Mr. Dorsey, as you noted in your testimony, your office has
identified information security as a top management challenge
in the Department of Transportation. But yet the DOT has not
resolved dozens of open recommendations by your office in the
last year.
In the report done by Clifton Larson Allen LLP released in
October of this year, they concluded that the DOT must develop
and communicate an organizationwide supply chain risk
management strategy and implementation plan to guide and govern
supply chain risks.
What do you see as barriers to this recommendation being
implemented?
And given the supply chain issues we are currently
experiencing, how urgently can the Department of Transportation
act on this recommendation to avoid future disruptions?
[Pause.]
Mr. Carbajal. I think you need to get unmuted.
Mr. Dorsey. Sorry. Thank you for the question, Congressman.
As noted in my testimony, I noted three key areas that the
Department needs to take immediate steps to address their
cybersecurity issues that we have identified over the years.
Similar to addressing supply chain risk management issues, this
applies to all of the cybersecurity issues associated with the
Department.
And what the Department needs to do, from the start, is
solidify its leadership at the Department's Chief Information
Security Office level to ensure that, working with the current
and new chief information officer, that they establish the
right type of framework and controls to ensure the enforcement
of the various recommendations that we have made over the
years.
The second thing that the Department needs to do is to
develop a comprehensive, DOT-wide cybersecurity strategy to
address our recurring weaknesses. Until they do so, which we
have made a recommendation--we have made an overarching
recommendation this year, and to the Department's credit, they
agreed to implement that particular recommendation. Once they
do that, and they meet the intent of the recommendation, then I
think that will go a long way with addressing some of the
concerns regarding supply chain risk management.
And the last thing the Department needs to do is to ensure
they put the proper controls in place to protect and secure its
IT infrastructure. And in regards to supply chain risk
management, that is a key area that we focused on during our
enterprise-level review this year, and we will continue to
report out on that as we move forward. Thank you.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Ms. Newhouse, leaving ourselves open to ransomware and
other cyberattacks puts people's lives in jeopardy. It is a
national security risk and threatens our economy. There needs
to be a better communication between the private sector and
Government to ensure we are prepared for future attacks.
In our hearing of November 4th, we heard concerns from
industry representatives that reporting mandates would create a
flood of information, resulting in pertinent information being
lost or skipped over by agencies.
What steps are being taken by the TSA to ensure reporting
mandates are collecting and processing pertinent information in
an effective manner?
And, two, can you walk me through how TSA takes in reported
cyber threats, and then processes the data?
Ms. Newhouse. Thank you, Congressman, I appreciate that.
And I am very proud of the fact that we have continued robust
engagement, a lot of engagement with a lot of stakeholders,
including those who served on the panel, the previous hearing.
Particularly, just myself in this past week, we have had
executive-level meetings with senior executives in rail and
passenger rail on this very topic. We have received their
feedback on what we call our draft security directives, and
that better informed our definition of what we were looking
for, in terms of a reportable cybersecurity incident. We have
made it more effective, less broad. So, it is an actual--or an
incident that is reasonably likely to have a devastating impact
on any of their systems.
So, it is also important to note that those reports go to
what we call CISA Central. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency has a centralized operation center. Our
directives mandate reporting of that information to CISA
Central.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. My time is up. I yield back.
Mr. Auchincloss. The Chair recognizes Ms. Van Duyne for 5
minutes.
Ms. Van Duyne. Thank you very much. I want to thank all of
you for being with us this morning.
My district is home to Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport, which is also the largest economic driver in the State
of Texas, and one of the Nation's most important airline hubs.
Over Thanksgiving weekend, we saw passenger numbers exceed 90
percent of pre-pandemic volume throughout the country.
DFW Airport is part of a working group with DHS and TSA,
and I have heard that they have benefited from transparency,
and have gained valuable information from working together,
while also making positive improvements after TSA conducted a
review.
Mr. Grossman, many of our airport critical systems, such as
radar systems, are hosted by airports around the country. Does
the FAA offer collaboration similar to what we have seen with
DHS and TSA for airports?
And the second question would be what more can the FAA do
to expand current collaboration and increase information
sharing with our airports?
Mr. Grossman. Thank you for those questions. I may have you
repeat the first one, but I will answer the second one first.
We collaborate extensively with airports through our
Aviation Cyber Initiative, as well as the Aviation Sector
Coordinating Council, which has airport authorities and AIA as
members. And so, our collaboration with airports is pretty rich
in substance. We share best practices with airports and, on
many occasions, when there was a vulnerability identified, I
believe on an airport lighting system that was a non-FAA
component, we immediately shared that across the airport
industry.
And I would just ask if you could repeat the first
question.
Ms. Van Duyne. So, the first question I talked about DHS
and TSA, and how they have collaborations in a working group
that is focused on transparencies and ways to better
collaborate, and I didn't know if--the question was, does the
FAA have a similar working group with airports, like the other
two do?
Mr. Grossman. Well, we participate with TSA on the airports
working group. And so----
Ms. Van Duyne. OK. OK. I have got a followup question for
Mr. Grossman and for Victoria Newhouse.
Everything that we have heard from airlines is that in
2022, that could be a record-breaking year, in terms of traffic
from Europe, the Middle East, and South America, given the
pent-up demand.
So, obviously, Omicron can throw a wrench into those plans,
but CBP staffing for international arrivals is going to be
critical. It could be a significant pinch point, if they are
not prepared. So how is the FAA preparing for further
disruptions in the system, as we move closer to the busiest
travel time of the year?
Mr. Grossman. Well, again, that is--I apologize, that is
not a cybersecurity-specific question. I believe our staffing
numbers are not going to be impacted by that.
Ms. Van Duyne. OK, so are you expecting further
disruptions, or no?
Mr. Grossman. I am not expecting any further disruptions,
no.
Ms. Van Duyne. OK, so there are no preparations being made,
then, for the increased travel in 2022?
Mr. Grossman. Well, we are staffed for that increased
travel. I guess I am not sure of----
Ms. Van Duyne. OK.
Mr. Grossman [continuing]. The question, specifically.
Ms. Van Duyne. OK.
Mr. Grossman. So----
Ms. Van Duyne. So, Ms. Newhouse, what is the TSA's plan to
ensure checkpoints have proper staffing, and wait times are
minimized for passengers?
Ms. Newhouse. Congresswoman, we are leaning forward very
heavily. As you may have heard from Administrator Pekoske over
this past year, we have worked very hard to hire as many
officers as we can. It is a very competitive labor market.
But we are also focused on ensuring real-time reporting. We
share that with our airline and airport partners daily, and
sometimes hourly, to ensure any sort of issues in the system,
whether it is equipment or personnel-related, is addressed
immediately.
Last, we do have our national deployment force that is
ready and able to deploy at a moment's notice to support
increased operations around the country. We have seen that
successfully for major sporting events, such as the Super Bowl,
spring training. Also, in the event of a natural disaster, we
are able to put our personnel in to support air operations,
while the personnel who are affected on the ground and their
families can evacuate safely. Thank you.
Ms. Van Duyne. I appreciate that. I, again, have gotten
lots of calls and questions from folks who are constituents in
the 24th Congressional District. They travel a lot, and there
is a lot of frustration that they are feeling like the lines
are getting much longer, that there are fewer TSA folks
working. So, I just want to make sure that that is a focus that
you guys are working on.
Thank you very much, and I yield back.
Mr. Auchincloss. The Chair recognizes Mr. Lamb for 5
minutes.
Mr. Lamb. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to all of our
witnesses.
Mr. Dorsey, I wanted to start with you. I took from your
testimony that, while there are several sort of technological
and purely cybersecurity issues at play here, there seems to
be, at the foundation, kind of a personnel issue of maintaining
consistent leadership in the key roles, and keeping people in
place, and bringing people up through the system so that they
understand it. And that is very similar to what I have seen on
other committees dealing not only with cybersecurity, but also
just kind of like talent--or technology acquisition and
implementation.
And so, it is not an easy problem to solve. I was just
curious if, in your work, you saw any commonalities about why
we were losing people, why we were failing to gain them in the
first place, or any suggestions about how we could start to fix
the personnel side of this.
Mr. Dorsey. Thank you for your question, Congressman.
Our assessments don't necessarily review what the
workforce-related issues are, with respect to the Department's
cybersecurity posture. So, I will not be able to provide you
with a direct answer.
What I will say is that I am very encouraged by the
Department's current chief information officer, and the various
discussions that I have had with him regarding the effort and
his plans, moving forward, with respect to addressing the
workforce issues.
What our reviews have found is that there has been
inconsistency at the top regarding the Department's leadership
from the chief information officer, as well as the chief
information security officer. And, as I noted in my testimony,
over the last year the Department had an acting chief
information security officer who said cybersecurity was not his
primary role and responsibility.
But what I will say is I am encouraged by the conversations
that I have had with the current chief information officer, and
I look forward to working with him, moving forward. Thank you.
Mr. Lamb. I appreciate that, thank you.
Do any of our agency witnesses want to weigh in on this
question?
Basically, what I am trying to get at is this is a common
problem for us, because, obviously, people with strong
cybersecurity management backgrounds are also in very high
demand in the private sector. So, I don't know if you have any
success stories or suggestions you could make to us about
trying to put ourselves on a firmer footing here, from a
personnel perspective.
Is that Mr. Schachter from DOT?
You are on mute, it sounds like.
Mr. Schachter. Thank you. Yes, I would like to respond to
that, and thank you for the question.
It gives me the opportunity to say that, after having noted
that improving cybersecurity at DOT is our number-one priority.
Our second priority is investing in our workforce, and that
means investing and helping them develop their careers, so that
they are not only able to perform at higher levels with their
current responsibilities, but they are adequately prepared for
future responsibilities.
It also includes recruitment and making sure that we hire
in the right people with the greatest potential, and that we
are looking at our own people for future professional
opportunities.
I will refer back to my experience as CTO and CIO at the
New York City Department of Transportation, where I served for
13 years. And in that role, we were able to achieve very low
levels of attrition, due to a robust training program that
invested in our staff, made them part of the agency's strategic
mission, where they felt ownership and empowered. And even
though the private sector often came calling with higher
salaries, we lost relatively few people.
And I understand, from industry information, that is a
frequent problem not only for the Government, but even private-
sector companies losing staff to one another as each tries to
outdo the others for the best food, or health club, in addition
to just cash compensation. And the Government is often at a
disadvantage when trying to compete in that arena.
So, I think what we can do, though, is we play to our
strengths, which is the importance of our mission, the
opportunity for people to make a contribution to improving--and
now, in this environment--the United States. And I believe that
we will have a compelling story to tell that will both attract
good new people, as well as help us keep the good ones that we
already have.
Mr. Lamb. I agree. We have to appeal to their patriotism.
And I hope, if there is a way that we can help any of your
agencies do that, you will let us know, because we know how
important it is. Thank you for your participation.
Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Mr. Auchincloss. The Chair recognizes Mrs. Steel for 5
minutes.
Mrs. Steel. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman
and Ranking Member Graves, for holding this important hearing.
During my tenure, while serving as Orange County Supervisor
and on the board of directors for the Orange County
Transportation Authority, there was a cyberattack on the OCTA.
Hackers froze some of OCTA's computer systems for 2 days and
demanded ransom to unfreeze them. We did not pay the ransom,
and chose to ignore the demand, and we had staff restore all
infected servers. We are very lucky about it.
So, I want to ask Ms. Newhouse, are there ways Federal
agencies can improve communication with State and local
government to best protect against these cyberattacks?
And do you think the United States has the proper workforce
to fight these current and future threats?
These threats are coming in from sometimes China, sometimes
North Korea. So, do you have that?
Ms. Newhouse. Thank you, Congresswoman, and we are very
proud of our relationships with our both Federal, State, and
local partners, many of whom operate critical transportation
assets throughout the country.
We have a very robust field operation now in place that
focuses solely on surface operations. That is one resource that
is available 24/7. Each region of our country--we have divided
it up into six regions--has a responsible executive, and an
entire team of personnel ready to go to engage one-on-one.
But you are absolutely--you hit it on the nail. That
continued collaboration and dissemination of information, it
could be anonymized, but it is important that we continue to
provide both threat and indicator information to all operators,
whether they are State or local or private, and we have
established a number of mechanisms to do that through our
directives.
We are also looking for [inaudible] reporting so that way
we can filter that, and make sure it gets sent out anonymized,
and work through CISA and CISA Central to make sure those
reports are getting disseminated in a very timely manner. Our
TSA Operations Center also serves that--I would call it a
redundancy.
Third, we do have what I think are pretty unique
information-sharing cells within the United States Government.
We actually have groups of individuals, both for surface
transportation and aviation, that can actually participate in
daily threat briefings with the TSA. They can do it remotely
from their locations, and that is another opportunity where we,
again, provide that persistent information, both indicators,
threat and tools.
We do also have--you point out that the nation-state
actors--CISA's security bulletins, just as recently as last
week, was issued referencing a nation-state actor. That is
where TSA, the DHS enterprise, works very closely with our U.S.
intelligence community. We rely closely and heavily on their
intelligence and assessments, along with our Federal Bureau of
Investigation and other law enforcement entities.
We do have the workforce in place in the United States
Government. I have a background in intelligence operations
myself, and I can say with personal knowledge that we do have
direct access to that intelligence and law enforcement
information.
Mrs. Steel. Thank you very much for your detailed answer.
Admiral, I have a question that--you know, protecting
against cyber threats is really critical for the Ports of Long
Beach and L.A. Right now, we have a supply chain crisis, as we
have about 175 ships waiting to unload. So, it is very
important.
So, Congress has made several changes to better integrate
cybersecurity planning and response. How is the Coast Guard
conducting vulnerability assessments of maritime critical
infrastructure?
Can you describe how the Coast Guard builds cyber
resilience in the Ports of L.A. and Long Beach to protect this
port and others like it from attack?
Admiral Mauger. Congresswoman, the current supply chain
crisis really highlights the importance of the MTS to our
national economy, and to our national security, and it really
emphasizes the need to put proper protective measures in place,
but then also be able to be resilient and respond to attack.
We have put together a comprehensive framework as the lead
Federal maritime regulator across the whole prevention and
response framework, to make sure that port communities and
maritime critical infrastructure are able to prevent attacks,
but then are able to respond and be resilient.
The Port Security Grant Program is a key program for
building resiliency into the ports. Through funding in fiscal
year 2021, we were able to fund 60 projects at about $18
million and provide key ports such as the Ports of L.A. and
L.B. the opportunity to increase their assessments.
And I am happy to follow up with a brief for you, ma'am,
afterwards, if desired.
Mrs. Steel. Thank you very much, Admiral. I have one more
question, but you know what? I am going to just submit this
question.
Thank you. My time is up, and I yield back.
Mr. Auchincloss. That concludes our hearing.
I would like to thank each of the witnesses for your
testimony today. Your comments have been insightful and
helpful.
I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing
remain open until such time as our witnesses have provided
answers to any questions that may have been submitted to them
in writing.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 days for any additional comments and information
submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in the record
of today's hearing.
Without objection so ordered.
The committee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 1:20 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]

Submissions for the Record

----------

Prepared Statement of Hon. Frederica S. Wilson, a Representative in
Congress from the State of Florida
Thank you, Chairman DeFazio, for today's hearing.
As our nation's critical infrastructure increasingly relies on
cutting-edge technology, cybersecurity must be a top priority to avert
attacks on facilities and systems, such as the Turkey Point Nuclear
Generating Station located in South Florida.
It is imperative that the federal government is a leader in this
space to help stakeholders implement the best cybersecurity practices.
Failing to do so will compromise critical systems that can have
devastating impacts on our safety, economy, and security.
I am grateful that the Biden administration has taken steps to
improve the nation's cybersecurity by issuing Executive Order 14028 to
improve the nation's infrastructure.
I am also proud to have supported the roughly $2 billion provided
in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to modernize and secure
our critical infrastructure.
I look forward to working with my colleagues and the private sector
to enhance cybersecurity preparedness, increase the cybersecurity
workforce, and protect citizens.
With that, I have a few questions.

Appendix

----------

Questions from Hon. Frederica S. Wilson to Cordell Schachter, Chief
Information Officer, U.S. Department of Transportation

Question 1. Mr. Schachter: Thank you for your testimony. As you
mentioned in your statement, there are multiple open findings from
previous cybersecurity audits, which puts DOT at risk. Some of these
findings were reported years ago. In some instances, even when
recommendations were reported as completed, they were not tested or
implemented properly, as was the case with the FTA's financial
management systems.
Mr. Schachter: What is the department's long-term plan to expedite
the implementation of cybersecurity recommendations and how will
current efforts, like the cyber sprints, help?
Answer. Thank you for the opportunity to address the issues raised
in this question. We take seriously open audit findings that require
action. Cyber Sprints accelerate progress by focusing Office of the CIO
and Operating Administration information technology staff efforts on
priority activities, eliminating obstacles to progress during frequent
checkpoints, and engaging additional or leadership resources if needed.
Among the criteria of tasks addressed in the sprints are open audit
findings.

Question from Hon. Garret Graves to Cordell Schachter, Chief
Information Officer, U.S. Department of Transportation

Question 2. I've read reports that there are some 500,000 vacancies
for cybersecurity professionals in the U.S. workforce, making it nearly
impossible for us to get a handle on the next generation of threats.
Additionally, we've heard from industry that they feel that talent is
relegated to SCIFs in the federal government, fusion centers, and big
technology companies--preventing talent from being available to
critical infrastructure at the local level. What can we be doing to
rethink the workforce model for cybersecurity-specific professionals?
Answer. Thank you for the opportunity to address the issues raised
in this question. DOT's Office of the Chief Information Officer
(OCIO)'s two top priorities are improving DOT's cybersecurity and
workforce development of OCIO staff, including recruiting high quality
cybersecurity experts. I believe the government mission is a compelling
``selling point'' to attract new staff. Similarly, working at US DOT
and helping protect the nation's critical infrastructure in
transportation is another compelling selling point for recruitment. We
will also continue working with our commercial and governmental
partners to engage the resources we need. Federal cyber workforce
training and education initiatives can be found at the Department of
Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology's National
Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), the National Science
Foundation's CyberCorps Scholarships for Service, and CISA's National
Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies.

Question from Hon. Seth Moulton to Cordell Schachter, Chief Information
Officer, U.S. Department of Transportation

Question 3. Mr. Schachter, America depends critically on GPS for
much more than just navigation with our smartphones, and we have no
alternative system. This creates a single point of failure, vulnerable
to both cyber and kinetic threats. In fact, after their government's
November 15 ASAT test, a Russian state television broadcast boasted
they could destroy all our GPS satellites at the same time. The
National Timing Resilience and Security Act of 2018 mandated the
Department Transportation have a backup and alternative system up and
running by December 2020, but the previous administration did nothing.
What is the Biden administration's Department of Transportation doing
to comply with the law and get a GPS complementary and backup system in
operation to decrease the severity of threats like these from Russia
and China?
Answer. Thank you for providing an opportunity to provide a
detailed response to this important question. Our Global Positioning
System (GPS) is the predominant technology in the field for
Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT). It supports critical
transportation infrastructure and is essential for national and
economic security in many other areas. There are an estimated 900
million GPS receivers across America, including those used for
emergency response, transportation safety, general navigation, timing
signals, and high-precision instruments for local-area climatology
studies, weather prediction, surveying, precision agriculture, machine
control, and scientific applications.
DOT conducted a GPS Backup and Complementary PNT Demonstration
involving 11 technology vendors in response to a requirement in the FY
2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The 2021 DOT
Complementary PNT Demonstration Report to Congress recommends that DOT
develop requirements, standards, test procedures, and performance
monitoring capabilities to ensure that civil PNT services, and the
equipment that utilizes them, meet necessary levels of interoperable
safety and resilience.
The ``Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018,'' (P.L.
115-282; December 4, 2018) included Sec. 514, ``Backup National Timing
System,'' also known as the ``National Timing Resilience and Security
Act of 2018.''
We support the proposed repeal of the National Timing Resilience
and Security Act in the President's FY 2022 Budget Request. This is
informed by recent federal analyses, reports, and technology
demonstrations, where DOT finds that 1) no single solution for the
provision of back-up PNT services can meet the diversity of critical
infrastructure application requirements, and 2) it would be inefficient
and anti-competitive for the Federal Government to procure or otherwise
fund a specific backup PNT solution for non-federal users.
Rather than building or otherwise procuring a new system, DOT, in
partnership with the Department of Homeland Security, is better
positioned to enable and encourage the owners and operators of critical
infrastructure to be responsible users of PNT, leveraging commercially-
available PNT technologies to secure access to complementary PNT
services.

Questions from Hon. Michael Guest to Cordell Schachter, Chief
Information Officer, U.S. Department of Transportation

Question 4. Each state has a designated CISA ``Protective Security
Advisor'' that coordinates with members of the critical infrastructure
community and works to help them prepare/defend against cyber-attacks.
Can you tell me about the interface your agencies have with these
Advisors and what role they play in your industries?
Answer. DOT's Office of Intelligence, Security, and Emergency
Response facilitates DOT's role as Co-Sector Risk Management Agency for
the Transportation Systems sector infrastructure. It partners with the
other Co-Sector Risk Management Agency, the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) and its Transportation Security Administration and U.S.
Coast Guard. DOT does directly engage with CISA's Protective Security
Advisors (PSAs). During incident response PSAs and DOT may act in
parallel. For example, during a hurricane, PSAs based in the region
impacted may provide local information about cross-sector
infrastructure concerns to DHS for integration with national response
efforts led by FEMA. DOT's Office of Intelligence, Security, and
Emergency Response may also provide information to inform FEMA's
national response.

Question 5. Earlier this year, in discussions with CISA Director
Inglis, we discussed the importance of protecting our digital
infrastructure, its supply chain, and preventing overdependency of
manufacturing critical digital goods by adversarial countries, which
they could possibly use against us. How can the FAA and DOT work
alongside private sector stakeholders and Congress to strengthen our
digital infrastructure supply chain, industry standards, and
enforcement of those standards when it comes to high level digital
hardware?
Answer. The FAA and DOT works in partnership with DHS and DOD
through the Aviation Cyber Initiative (ACI) Interagency Task Force in
engaging with a range of government, industry, and international
stakeholders to identify, assess, and analyze cyber threats,
vulnerabilities, and consequences within the aviation ecosystem through
research, development, testing, and evaluation initiatives. The ACI
mission is to reduce cybersecurity risks and improve cyber resilience
to support safe, secure, and efficient operations of the Nation's
Aviation Ecosystem. We also leverage industry expertise to develop and
update industry standards relevant to aviation cybersecurity. An
example is RTCA Special Committee SC-216, which is chaired by a
representative industry stakeholder and has an FAA policy
representative.\1\ SC-216 recently revised their Aeronautical Systems
Security standard (DO-365A). This past December, the committee also
published a new standard, Aeronautical Information System Security
Framework Guidance (DO-391). All of our efforts with Standards
Development Organizations (SDO) are geared towards developing industry
standards that can be used as an acceptable means of compliance to one
or more of our certification requirements. SDOs, like RTCA, ASTM and
SAE, often have counterpart working groups in the European standards
development community, which provides additional expertise and a wider
global acceptance of the developed standards.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ https://www.rtca.org/sc-216/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We also note that Chris Inglis is the National Cyber Director, a
position that is different than the Director of CISA. The Director of
CISA is Jen Easterly.

Question 6. Director Inglis also emphasized the need for
accountability in cybersecurity practices. Each one of you represents a
different set of industry stakeholders with vastly different needs in
this space. For bad actors within your jurisdiction that allow their
cybersecurity measures to fall below public or industry standards, what
are ways that Congress and your agencies can hold those folks
accountable? Many stakeholders mention that they are more robust in
developing cybersecurity measures and have been for decades. So, what
are ways to hold bad actors accountable without installing mandates
that may limit the private sector's own work in this space?
Answer. Thank you for the opportunity to address the issues raised
in this question. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the
Department of Transportation (DOT) are designated as the Co-Sector Risk
Management Agencies (SRMAs) for the Transportation Systems Sector. DHS,
specifically through the Transportation Security Administration (TSA),
worked with DOT and its Operating Administrations (OAs) to coordinate
industry outreach efforts aimed at informing and receiving feedback
from stakeholders on available cybersecurity training and resources;
and more recently, TSA's Security Directives and security program
amendments on cybersecurity. Additionally, TSA spearheads the
developments of the National Strategy for Transportation Security as
the lead for DHS. Further, TSA has worked extensively with CISA to
assess sector cyber risk, including the Pipeline Cybersecurity
Initiative (PCI) and the ACI, which conduct Validated Architecture
Design Review assessments of major pipeline and airport systems.
DOT is working closely with TSA, CISA, and the Department of Energy
in the implementation of the President's Industrial Control System
Cybersecurity Initiative for natural gas pipelines. The Initiative is a
voluntary effort by government and critical infrastructure owners and
operators. DOT is also participating in the CISA and NIST led effort to
develop cybersecurity performance goals for control systems and
critical infrastructure, as outlined in National Security Memorandum 5
(NSM-5) issued by President Biden last July. However, voluntary
measures alone in some cases may be inadequate to address the rapidly
evolving threat facing the critical infrastructure every American
relies on. TSA has issued cybersecurity-related Security Directives and
Information Circulars (IC) for critical elements of surface
transportation--including pipelines--and has also issued Security
Program Changes and an IC for aviation elements.
We have balanced responsibility with flexibility by prioritizing
certain operator practices as requirements and others as
recommendations using our authorities. These include each operator
designating a cybersecurity coordinator, implementing specific
mitigations measures to reduce cybersecurity risk, and developing plans
to minimize disruption in the event of a malicious cyber intrusion.

Question 7. Many industry stakeholders utilize early notification
networks. However, the public sector lacks a robust system to alert
private carriers or shippers of an attack across the system. To
critical infrastructure, the ability to limit damage seems crucial. Can
you expand on how early notification networks are used by the private
sector and why coordination with a federal government system is so
important?
Answer. CISA and FBI periodically issue joint Cybersecurity
Advisories (CSAs) which are posted on the CISA Alerts webpage. These
Alerts are also pushed to a wide-range of stakeholders, to include the
Sector Risk Management Agencies and Information Sharing and Analysis
Centers (ISACs) for further dissemination to sector stakeholders. There
are also several private companies who offer similar notification
products. The US Coast Guard and CISA are responsible for notifications
to the Maritime subsector.
In the railroad subsector, the Association of American Railroads
(AAR) utilizes the Railway Alert Network (RAN) to provide early
notifications to the private sector. Separately, when Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA) reporting is either required or deemed necessary,
the agency provides situational reports to AAR, the American Short Line
and Regional Railroad Association (ASLRRA), the Transportation Security
Administration (TSA), and the Surface Deployment and Distribution
Command (SDDC). These situational reports are generally disseminated to
the carriers participating in RAN.
In the commercial motor vehicle subsector, FMCSA leverages
GovDelivery, a web-based e-mail subscription management system, for
providing news and information emails and posts notifications about
jurisdiction-specific changes and updates in processes and guidelines.
Notifications can span the following subtopics: Announcements & News,
Registration & Licensing, Rules & Regulations, Rulemaking, Rulemaking
Notices, and Outreach.

Question from Hon. Nikema Williams to Cordell Schachter, Chief
Information Officer, U.S. Department of Transportation

Question 8. In last month's hearing on this topic, we heard about
the need for local transportation agencies to assess their own level of
``cyber maturity''--understanding what cyber protections they have and
what protections they need. Drawing both on your experience in federal
and local government, how can local transportation agencies best access
support and resources from the Department of Transportation to assess
and strengthen their own cyber protections?
Answer. Thank you for the opportunity to address the issues raised
in this question. DOT has many resources publicly available to local
transportation agencies to assess and strengthen their own cyber
protections. For example, the following webpage lists documents with
guidance on multiple cyber topics. https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/
gsearch?terms=cyber&maxResults=50&start=0
DOT's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) regularly provides
information about best practices gathered from agencies such as TSA and
the National Institute of Standards and Technology. FHWA supports its
stakeholders' work to improve their cybersecurity including reporting
and responding to cybersecurity incidents and providing training and
reference materials.
DOT has also been collaborating with CISA on establishing a common
baseline of cyber performance goals for critical infrastructure control
systems which will be finalized this summer. DOT will also be
contributing to the transportation sector-specific cybersecurity
performance goals which will build upon the common baseline and include
goals specific to the transportation sector and subsectors. More
information can be found here: https://www.cisa.gov/control-systems-
goals-and-objectives

Questions from Hon. Frederica S. Wilson to Larry Grossman, Chief
Information Security Officer, Federal Aviation Administration

Question 1. Mr. Grossman, in your statement, you mentioned the
National Academy of Sciences study on the FAA's cybersecurity
workforce, which was directed by Congress. The results of this study
were received in June 2021. Please elaborate on the study's
recommendations to increase workforce diversity and what specific
objectives and action items the FAA has in place to achieve that goal.
Answer. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recognizes the
importance of recruiting efforts to attract a diverse pool of qualified
employees. The agency's current initiatives include cybersecurity as
part of a broader aviation-focused engagement. In the FAA's Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Aviation and Space Education
(AVSED) program, youth from diverse backgrounds are inspired to pursue
aerospace careers, including those that are cybersecurity-focused. The
FAA currently leverages several federal hiring and personnel management
authorities afforded to cyber-specific employees, such as on-the-spot
hiring.
Pursuant to Section 549 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (PL
115-254), the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) published a report
examining the FAA's cybersecurity workforce challenges, reviewing the
current strategy for meeting those challenges, and recommending ways to
strengthen the FAA's cybersecurity workforce titled: ``Looking Ahead at
the Cybersecurity Workforce at the Federal Aviation
Administration''.\1\ FAA reviewed the NAS report and recently provided
a report to Congress regarding the results of the study.\2\ The
challenges identified in the study, along with opportunities and
recommendations, have validated existing FAA cyber workforce
initiatives and inspired potential new initiatives. Through the six
strategic outcomes, continued investment in existing initiatives, and
promoting new programs developed as a result of this study, the FAA
will strengthen its cybersecurity workforce today and in the future.

Question from Hon. Garret Graves to Larry Grossman, Chief Information
Security Officer, Federal Aviation Administration

Question 2. I've read reports that there are some 500,000 vacancies
for cybersecurity professionals in the U.S. workforce, making it nearly
impossible for us to get a handle on the next generation of threats.
Additionally, we've heard from industry that they feel that talent is
relegated to SCIFs in the federal government, fusion centers, and big
technology companies--preventing talent from being available to
critical infrastructure at the local level. What can we be doing to
rethink the workforce model for cybersecurity-specific professionals?
Answer. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recognizes the
challenging cybersecurity labor market, similar to many other
organizations seeking to hire and retain cyber personnel. There are
many programs in place in the federal government to accelerate and
simplify the hiring process for cybersecurity personnel.
The FAA recognizes the importance of recruiting efforts to attract
a diverse pool of qualified employees. The agency's current initiatives
include cybersecurity as part of a broader aviation-focused engagement.
In the FAA's Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Aviation
and Space Education (AVSED) program, youth from diverse backgrounds are
inspired to pursue aerospace careers. The program seeks to create a
consistent pipeline of aerospace professionals for the workforce of the
future, including those that are cybersecurity-focused.
While the FAA has some employees who work in a Sensitive
Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) environment very few members
of our cybersecurity workforce are relegated to a SCIF, rather they
will enter the SCIF only for classified discussions, then leave the
secure area to engage with other FAA staff and aviation stakeholders as
needed. Pursuant to Section 549 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018
(PL 115-254), the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) published a report
examining the FAA's cybersecurity workforce challenges, reviewing the
current strategy for meeting those challenges, and recommending ways to
strengthen the FAA's cybersecurity workforce titled: ``Looking Ahead at
the Cybersecurity Workforce at the Federal Aviation
Administration''.\3\ FAA reviewed the NAS report and recently provided
a report to Congress regarding the results of the study.\4\ The
challenges identified in the study, along with opportunities and
recommendations, have validated existing FAA cyber workforce
initiatives and inspired potential new initiatives. Through the six
strategic outcomes, continued investment in existing initiatives, and
promoting new programs developed as a result of this study, the FAA
will strengthen its cybersecurity workforce today and in the future.

Questions from Hon. Michael Guest to Larry Grossman, Chief Information
Security Officer, Federal Aviation Administration

Question 3. Each state has a designated CISA ``Protective Security
Advisor'' that coordinates with members of the critical infrastructure
community and works to help them prepare/defend against cyber-attacks.
Can you tell me about the interface your agencies have with these
Advisors and what role they play in your industries?
Answer. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
Protective Security Advisor program is within the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS). DHS serves as a tri-chair of the Aviation
Cyber Initiative (ACI) with the Department of Defense and the
Department of Transportation (DOT), with the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) representing DOT. Through this partnership, we
coordinate and collaborate with government and industry to improve
cybersecurity protections and response capabilities. ACI focuses on
cybersecurity protections within the aviation sub-sector of the
critical infrastructure community and includes an active Community of
Interest (COI) that includes over 1000 participants across the aviation
ecosystem from both the public and private sector. COI participants
include airlines and airfreight, aircraft and avionics manufacturers,
aviation industry associations and service providers, academia, and
Federally Funded Research and Development Centers. ACI includes both
domestic and international participants as cybersecurity protections
within the aviation community are a global concern. Current priorities
of ACI include aviation cybersecurity risk mitigation efforts, cyber
research and development, information sharing, cybersecurity training
specific to the unique aspects of the aviation environment, and
aviation cybersecurity exercises.

Question 4. Earlier this year, in discussions with CISA Director
Inglis, we discussed the importance of protecting our digital
infrastructure, its supply chain, and preventing overdependency of
manufacturing critical digital goods by adversarial countries, which
they could possibly use against us. How can the FAA and DOT work
alongside private sector stakeholders and Congress to strengthen our
digital infrastructure supply chain, industry standards, and
enforcement of those standards when it comes to high level digital
hardware?
Answer. The FAA and DOT continue to work in partnership with DHS
and CISA through the ACI Tri-Chair relationship to create a balance
between government and private partnerships. We also leverage industry
expertise to develop and update industry standards relevant to aviation
cybersecurity. An example is RTCA Special Committee SC-216, which is
chaired by a representative industry stakeholder and has an FAA policy
representative.\5\ SC-216 recently revised their Aeronautical Systems
Security standard (DO-365A). This past December, the committee also
published a new standard, Aeronautical Information System Security
Framework Guidance (DO-391). All of our efforts with Standards
Development Organizations (SDO) are geared towards developing industry
standards that can be used as an acceptable means of compliance to one
or more of our certification requirements. SDOs, like RTCA, ASTM and
SAE, often have counterpart working groups in the European standards
development community, which provides additional expertise and a wider
global acceptance of the developed standards.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ https://www.rtca.org/sc-216/.

Question 5. Director Inglis also emphasized the need for
accountability in cybersecurity practices. Each one of you represents a
different set of industry stakeholders with vastly different needs in
this space. For bad actors within your jurisdiction that allow their
cybersecurity measures to fall below public or industry standards, what
are ways that Congress and your agencies can hold those folks
accountable? Many stakeholders mention that they are more robust in
developing cybersecurity measures and have been for decades. So, what
are ways to hold bad actors accountable without installing mandates
that may limit the private sector's own work in this space?
Answer. The FAA advises a cautious approach when considering any
potential aviation-related cybersecurity mandates and highlights that
any such mandates would need to provide sufficient flexibility, in
terms of measures and timelines for implementing enhancements, to allow
industry participants to appropriately protect the diverse range of
systems used in the aviation sub-sector. The expected improvement to
the industry's defenses from any mandate must also be carefully weighed
against its associated costs, taking into account the highly
sophisticated nature of some attacks.
Within the realm of the FAA's responsibility as the aviation safety
regulator and air navigation service provider for the U.S., the FAA
finds it much more successful to engage with our industry stakeholders
to encourage the voluntary adoption of successful cyber-hygiene
protocols. Our stakeholders are highly motivated to keep their systems
secure from cyber-attacks, as breaches of vulnerable systems can equate
to economic loss, loss of public trust, loss of efficiency and loss of
market share. We must also remember that our stakeholders' systems and
security needs vary widely and security solutions must be tailored--one
size does not fit all.

Question 6. Many industry stakeholders utilize early notification
networks. However, the public sector lacks a robust system to alert
private carriers or shippers of an attack across the system. To
critical infrastructure, the ability to limit damage seems crucial. Can
you expand on how early notification networks are used by the private
sector and why coordination with a federal government system is so
important?
Answer. FAA regulations require reporting of a variety of aviation
safety-related issues, but are generally agnostic as to their potential
cause, which may be unknown at the time of initial reporting. DHS is
the lead agency to receive private sector reports of cybersecurity
incidents and to facilitate individual asset or whole of government
response during a significant cyber incident. DHS's National
Cybersecurity and Communications Center shares information across the
public and private sectors (including the Aviation Information Sharing
and Analysis Center) to protect against similar incidents in the
future. The sharing of information is usually in the form of Alerts/
Advisories and Bulletins, Initial Network Analysis Reports and/or
Cybersecurity Coordination Action and Response calls. These early
notifications provide an opportunity for the government and private
sector partners to minimize the impact of a cyberattack by proactively
implementing protection mechanisms to block attacks while focusing
monitoring on those assets that are potentially the most vulnerable.
The Department of Justice, through the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, is
the lead agency for threat response during a significant incident. With
respect to aviation specifically, recent Transportation Security
Administration updates to airport and aircraft operator security
program requirements established cybersecurity incident reporting
requirements for airports and aircraft operators with the relevant
types of security programs.

Questions from Hon. Nikema Williams to Larry Grossman, Chief
Information Security Officer, Federal Aviation Administration

Question 7. Mr. Grossman, millions depend on both the services and
economic activity from transportation systems in my district, and a
disruption to one part of the system can impact the rest. A disruption
to the Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport could reach
from Delta Airlines to international travelers to aviation workers who
live in my district. Could you please describe how the Federal Aviation
Administration supports and shares information with airports like mine
to help safeguard the transportation system that depends on them from a
cyberattack?
Answer. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) participates in a
variety of airport safety and security government partnerships and
initiatives that identify and mitigate cyber threats to the nation's
airports and collaborate with partner agencies to disseminate airport-
related cyber threat information. In addition, Department of Homeland
Security's (DHS) National Cybersecurity and Communications Center
shares information across the public and private sectors to protect
against cybersecurity incidents. Moreover, the Transportation Security
Administration (TSA) recently published updated requirements regarding
cybersecurity information sharing for the nation's airports. In
addition, the FAA is one of the tri-chairs of the Aviation Cyber
Initiative, and the FAA works collaboratively with DHS and Department
of Defense to improve cybersecurity across the Aviation Ecosystem. This
collaboration includes participants across the airports community.

Question 8. Mr. Grossman, Internet access is an airport essential.
In 2018, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport's Wi-Fi
connectivity had to be taken down amidst a city-wide cyberattack. Do
you have any recommendations that will ensure airports can provide
Internet access to travelers while minimizing their networks'
vulnerability to cyberattacks?
Answer. While outside of FAA's mission set, FAA supports and
encourages industry efforts for the development of cybersecurity risk
management programs, information security standards and best practices
consistent with the National Institute of Standards and Technology
Cybersecurity Framework. The city-wide cyberattack in Atlanta was
indeed a surprising and widespread outage. During a cyberattack,
sometimes user connectivity may be affected for the protection of both
the users and systems, any response to an event must be aligned with
the potential impact associated with that event. TSA, who does have
statutory authority over airport cybersecurity operations, recently
published guidance for the nation's airports regarding cybersecurity.
The Office of Airports, along with the rest of the FAA, is working
closely with TSA to support their efforts.

Question from Hon. Steve Cohen to Victoria Newhouse, Deputy Assistant
Administrator for Policy, Plans, and Engagement, Transportation
Security Administration, U.S. Department of Homeland Security

Question 1. When traveling--especially while in airports, train
stations, or buses--people often make use of public Wi-Fi connections,
public charging ports, and other resources to keep their devices
charged and connected to the internet. What precautions is TSA taking
to oversee these services to prevent cyberattacks through public
networks or to stop cybercriminals from setting up networks that mimic
the genuine ones?
Answer. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) recently
issued cybersecurity requirements to operators in the aviation,
surface, and pipeline modes of transportation, including cybersecurity
incident reporting requirements. While these requirements vary to some
extent based on the operational requirements of each mode, all are
aimed at establishing a baseline of cybersecurity protection. To the
extent a public-facing Wi-Fi network is under the control of a covered
owner/operator, it may be subject to the new requirements.
Public networks, Wi-Fi connections, or other internet connections
provided, operated, and maintained by persons who are not covered by
the cybersecurity requirements noted above are not regulated by TSA.
The federal government continues to review and analyze
cybersecurity requirements within the various transportation modes. To
the extent not covered by existing requirements for aviation and
surface operators, we may consider additional measures to ensure
Information Technology and Operational Technology systems operated and
maintained by third-party vendors and contractor meet appropriate
security standards.

Questions from Hon. Sam Graves to Victoria Newhouse, Deputy Assistant
Administrator for Policy, Plans, and Engagement, Transportation
Security Administration, U.S. Department of Homeland Security

Question 2. Now that TSA has issued its security directive for
railroads, transit, and passenger rail, will TSA work with the affected
industries to develop guidance and other helpful materials to ensure
the contents and requirements of the Security Directives are well
understood and to support compliance with their mandated actions and
measures? How will this be done?
Answer. TSA offers assistance to surface transportation owners/
operators in understanding and complying with the security measures
identified within the Security Directives (SDs) through a variety of
means. TSA has and will continue to host industry calls with surface
transportation owner/operators discussing the provisions within the
SDs. The calls provide an opportunity for TSA to answer questions to
ensure understanding of the requirements and support compliance with
the defined security measures. Within each SD, an email address is
provided to allow industry to contact TSA should they have questions.
As common-themed questions are identified, TSA issues Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQs) to all applicable owner/operators. TSA also has
developed and will supplement guidance documents to provide additional
support to covered entities. TSA will also work with the trade
associations representing the covered owner/operators to provide
informational webinars and share best practices for implementing the
provisions of the SDs.

Question 3. TSA's Security Directive Pipeline--2021-02: Pipeline
Cybersecurity Mitigation Actions, Contingency Planning, and Testing (SD

Questions from Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford to Victoria Newhouse,
Deputy Assistant Administrator for Policy, Plans, and Engagement,
Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Department of Homeland
Security

Question 4. A major concern we've heard about the pipeline security
directives was that they were developed without meaningful input from
stakeholders with expertise in pipeline safety and operations, creating
implementation issues. For instance, some pipelines need to shut down
operations to implement the requirements. When the Colonial pipeline
shut down, the effects were felt across the entire southeast when
energy prices increased as people lost access to critical energy
products.
a.  How is TSA ensuring it will have the resources and technical
expertise to address technical issues for these and potential future
rulemakings and security directives?
Answer. TSA partnered with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA), the United States Coast Guard (USCG), the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE), and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration (PHMSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation
(DOT) in the development of SDs to ensure the utilization of high-level
technical expertise from other federal agencies. In addition to
interagency support, TSA has and will continue to seek input from
subject matter experts from the pipeline industry.
CISA remains engaged in providing cybersecurity subject matter
expertise in support of the SD implementation process. TSA is
leveraging CISA guidance and assessments to conduct further mode-
specific research and identify mechanisms to obtain stakeholder cyber
measures, determine gaps, and work with the National Risk Management
Center to develop a prioritized list of cyber risks. In addition, TSA
has recently hired cybersecurity specialists to work both in policy and
operations.

Between October and November 2021, TSA Security
Operations, Surface Operations established a new Cybersecurity Branch
to conduct and facilitate surface cybersecurity related assessments and
outreach efforts. Ten of the eleven cybersecurity expert positions have
been filled. In addition to the establishment of this Branch, there are
five Transportation Security Inspectors currently undergoing
cybersecurity specialized training to become cyber assessors.

TSA created a Cybersecurity section within the Policy,
Plans, and Engagement Surface Policy Division, Industry Engagement
Branch. This section is led by one Section Chief and supported by seven
cybersecurity specialists. This section coordinates with Surface
Operation's new Cybersecurity Branch, CISA, and other subject matter
experts to ensure vulnerability information, guidance, and mitigation
measures are shared as appropriate.

b.  How is TSA leveraging the expertise of other federal agencies,
such as DOT, in development and implementation of its security
directives and cybersecurity requirements for the transportation
sectors?
Answer. TSA continues to leverage the subject matter expertise
within the Department of Homeland Security, including CISA, as well as
the DOT's modal administrations for both surface and aviation
transportation. All of these federal partners provided crucial input
into the development of the TSA Cyber SDs and Information Circular.
Furthermore, all parties provided detailed information on the specifics
of these Cyber SDs and Information Circular to surface transportation
stakeholders through numerous conference calls and other industry
engagements. TSA, CISA, DOT, and other partners continue to provide
opportunities for industry to raise concerns, ask questions, or request
additional clarification through direct contact with TSA. TSA
coordinates the appropriate responses with federal partners to ensure
the industry receives responses needed to support successful
implementation of the Cyber SDs and Information Circular actions.
In the case of pipelines, TSA partnered with CISA, USCG, DOE, and
PHMSA in the development of those SDs. The SDs include a provision that
allows operators to raise any safety concerns associated with SD
implementation, which are then shared with PHMSA for review and
feedback.

Question 5. The previous mandatory directives for pipelines
followed the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack. What incident or
security threats are necessitating a mandatory security directive and
requirements for freight rail, transit, and aviation? How does TSA plan
to ensure ongoing timely and secure communications about cyber threats
to the transportation and infrastructure sectors?
Answer. Cyber threats from attackers remain acute. Attackers use
cyber operations to steal information, influence populations, and
damage industry, including physical and digital critical
infrastructure. The Director of National Intelligence has stated that
our adversaries and strategic competitors possess cyberattack
capabilities they could use against U.S. critical infrastructure,
including U.S. transportation. Additionally, nation states' increasing
use of cyber operations as a tool of national power, including
increasing use by militaries around the world, raises the prospect of
more destructive and disruptive cyber activity against all U.S.
critical infrastructure, including transportation.
We remain concerned about the disruptive impacts of ransomware
attacks, as demonstrated by the Colonial Pipeline attack. The U.S.
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated in late 2020 that
ransomware attacks--which have at least doubled since 2017--are often
directed against critical infrastructure entities at the state and
local level by exploiting gaps in cybersecurity, and that
cybercriminals will increasingly target U.S. critical infrastructure to
generate profit, including through ransomware.
Cyber actors have demonstrated their willingness to conduct cyber-
attacks against critical infrastructure by exploiting the vulnerability
of Internet-accessible Operational Technology (OT) assets and
Information Technology (IT) systems. As shown by recent ransomware
attacks, the United States' adversaries and strategic competitors will
continue to use cyber espionage and cyberattacks to seek political,
economic, and military advantage over the United States and its allies
and partners.
Cybersecurity incidents affecting surface transportation are a
growing threat. Given the multitude of connected devices already in use
by the surface transportation industry and the vast amount of data
generated (with more coming online soon), protecting the higher-risk
freight railroads, passenger railroads, and rail transit systems has
become an increasing critically important and complex undertaking to
protect critical infrastructure from malicious cyber-attack and other
cybersecurity-related threats.
As an example: In April 2021, hackers breached several computer
systems of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the nation's
largest mass transit agency that transports millions of people in and
around New York City every day. The intrusion was discovered in late
April when hackers linked to the Chinese government exploited security
flaws in Pulse Connect Secure, a Virtual Personal Network that allows
employees to connect remotely to their employer's network. The
cyberattack impacted three of the transit agency's 18 systems.
TSA also continues to share the most relevant and timely
information with surface transportation stakeholders to counter this
persistent threat. Most recently, a joint cybersecurity advisory from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), CISA, the Australian Cyber
Security Centre, and the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security
Centre highlighted ongoing malicious cyber activity by an advanced
persistent threat (APT) group associated with the government of Iran.
The advisory cited: ``The Iranian government-sponsored APT actors are
actively targeting a broad range of victims across multiple U.S.
critical infrastructure sectors, including the Transportation Sector
and the Healthcare and Public Health Sector, as well as Australian
organizations.''
TSA has a number of methods to provide timely security
communications to regulated parties. The primary means is through the
Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN), by which regulated
entities have access to their appropriate security web-board. These
web-boards house security requirements, intelligence reports,
frequently asked questions, information circulars, advisories, and
other communications. TSA also routinely invites impacted regulated
parties to receive classified and unclassified briefings on ongoing
threats. TSA also has a number of working groups through which
information is shared.
With regard to ensuring ongoing and timely communications about
cyber threats are provided to the transportation and infrastructure
sectors, TSA continues to bolster its intelligence information sharing
efforts. TSA has also partnered with aviation and surface stakeholders
to increase two-way sharing of cyber security threats to critical
infrastructure. This includes the creation and resourcing of two full-
time threat intelligence cells: the Aviation Domain Intelligence
Integration & Analysis Cell and the Surface Information Sharing Cell.
TSA's Field Intelligence Officers also routinely engage with
stakeholders around the country directly by passing threat information
and providing tailored classified and unclassified threat briefings.
Since the issuance of the SDs, TSA collaborated with the White
House National Security Council and the Office of Director of National
Intelligence to provide SD-impacted pipeline senior executives with
classified threat information. TSA also provided classified briefings
to pipeline Chief Executive Officers and Chief Information Officers/
Chief Information Security Officers at TSA Headquarters. The TSA
Headquarters briefings were a combined effort between TSA, CISA, and
FBI. TSA will continue to provide classified briefings twice a year for
pipeline owner/operators.
TSA also provided a security briefing to members of the Freight
Rail and Passenger Rail industries impacted by the Rail SDs. Plans call
for additional security briefings for rail industry representatives on
a recurring basis.
With respect to airport operators and aircraft operators, TSA,
under 49 CFR sections 1542.303(a) and 1544.305(a), has the ability to
issue mandatory measures when the agency determines that ``additional
security measures are necessary to respond to a threat assessment or to
a specific threat against civil aviation.'' In the case of aviation
requirements, TSA is opting to issue new requirements under TSA's
standard ``Amendment by TSA'' process (see 49 CFR sections 1542.105(c)
and 1544.105(c)). An Amendment by TSA may be issued ``if the safety and
the public interest require an amendment.'' This process does not
require there to be an imminent security threat or incident to have
occurred to issue new security measures.

Question 6. Does TSA or other federal agencies share any analysis
of information provided by the transportation and infrastructure
sectors on cyber incidents, threats, or vulnerabilities? Will the
information these industries are required to report to DHS be analyzed
and shared to help bolster their cyber risk management?
Answer. Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 41 calls for Federal
cyber incident response agencies to share incident information with
each other to achieve unity of governmental effort (see PPD-41 Sec.
III.D). Information provided to CISA pursuant to the SDs will be shared
by CISA with TSA and also shared with the National Response Center and
other agencies as appropriate.
TSA is leveraging CISA guidance and assessments to conduct further
mode-specific research and identify mechanisms to obtain stakeholder
cyber measures, determine gaps, and work with the National Risk
Management Center to develop a prioritized list of cyber risks.
TSA has shared lessons learned from the first pipeline Security
Directive (SD01) with industry representatives via stakeholder calls
and trade association meetings.
When TSA issued the requirements for reporting cybersecurity
incidents, the regulated parties were told that the information
provided to the CISA and to TSA may be used in reports. Specifically,
it said ``TSA may use the information, with company-specific data
redacted, for TSA's intelligence-derived reports. TSA and CISA also may
use information submitted for vulnerability identification, trend
analysis, or to generate anonymized indicators of compromise or other
cybersecurity products to prevent other cybersecurity incidents.''
TSA has a number of methods to communicate timely and secure
communications to regulated parties. The primary means is through the
HSIN, by which regulated entities have access to their appropriate
security web-board. These web-boards house security requirements,
intelligence reports, frequently asked questions, information
circulars, advisories, and other communications. TSA also routinely
invites impacted regulated parties to receive classified and
unclassified briefings on ongoing threats. TSA also has a number of
outlets by which to share information such as trade associations and
their cybersecurity workgroups, sector coordinating councils, and
information sharing and analysis centers. Through the use of HSIN,
briefings, and those various information sharing outlets, industry
stakeholders are provided with multiple facets to increase awareness of
current events, and identified cybersecurity threats and
vulnerabilities.

Questions from Hon. Seth Moulton to Victoria Newhouse, Deputy Assistant
Administrator for Policy, Plans, and Engagement, Transportation
Security Administration, U.S. Department of Homeland Security

Question 7. Ms. Newhouse, new cybersecurity requirements for rail
carriers were announced the day of this hearing, which includes
designating a cybersecurity coordinator, reporting hacking incidents
within 24 hours, conducting a vulnerability assessment, and developing
an incident-response plan for breaches. During our previous
cybersecurity hearing, the rail industry representative seemed opposed
to federal regulations regarding cybersecurity mandates in the private
sector. Can you explain why the rail industry is considered high-risk
and in need of this directive? What benefits do you expect from
mandating these new measures compared to voluntary guidance?
Answer. Cybersecurity incidents affecting surface transportation
entities are a growing threat that pose a risk to the national and
economic security of the United States. The cybersecurity security
directives were issued to the rail industry (higher risk freight
railroads, passenger railroads, and rail transit agencies) due to their
criticality to the nation's economy and national defense. These
entities transport the largest volumes of cargo and people and have
been the targets of cyber threat actors. While many of these entities
have initiated protective measures for enhanced cybersecurity, TSA
determined that there was a need to establish a baseline of practices
such as those included in the security directives.
The surface transportation industry utilizes a multitude of
connected devices and generates vast amounts of data. Malicious actors
have increasingly demonstrated the capability to conduct cyber-attacks
exploiting the vulnerabilities of Internet-accessible OT assets and IT
systems. In recent years, cyber attackers have maliciously targeted the
critical infrastructure of surface transportation modes in the U.S.,
including freight railroads, passenger railroads, and rail transit
systems, with multiple cyberattack and cyber espionage campaigns.\1\ By
targeting the integrated cyber and physical infrastructure of surface
transportation entities, these actions threaten the safe, secure, and
uninterrupted daily operation of surface transportation systems relied
upon by the U.S. economy with potential to cause nation-wide impact.
Given the significant ongoing threat to the surface transportation
sector, protecting the higher-risk freight railroads, passenger
railroads, and rail transit systems from malicious cyber-attack and
other cybersecurity-related threats is critically important to
safeguarding the nation's critical infrastructure. To counter this
threat, TSA determined that the requirements of Security Directive
1580-21-01 and Security Directive 1582-21-01 were urgently needed to
protect the surface transportation sector by mitigating and eliminating
cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ These activities include the April 2021 breach of New York
City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (the nation's largest mass
transit agency) by hackers linked to the Chinese government; the
December 2020 ``Sunburst'' attack on transit agencies; the August 2020
attack on the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority; the
2017 ransomware attack on the Sacramento Regional Transit District; and
the November 2016 ransomware attack on the San Francisco Municipal
Transportation agency. This threat is ongoing: on November 17, 2021 the
FBI, CISA, the Australian Cyber Security Centre, and the United
Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre issued a joint cybersecurity
advisory highlighting ongoing malicious cyber activity by an APT that
these agencies associated with the government of Iran. The advisory
states that ``The Iranian government-sponsored APT actors are actively
targeting a broad range of victims across multiple U.S. critical
infrastructure sectors, including the Transportation Sector and the
Healthcare and Public Health Sector, as well as Australian
organizations.'' Alert AA21-321A (November 17, 2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congress granted the TSA Administrator broad statutory
responsibility and authority with respect to the security of the
transportation system. Under the authorities of 49 U.S.C. section 114,
TSA may take immediate action to impose measures to protect
transportation security without providing notice or an opportunity for
comment. This provision specifically recognizes that there are times
when action is necessary that does not provide for the rather lengthy
process necessary to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking and finalize
a rule.
TSA's regulations identify higher-risk owner/operators of freight
railroads, passenger railroads, and rail transit operations. These
determinations align with DHS's official definition of risk as the
``potential for an adverse outcome assessed as a function of threats,
vulnerabilities, and consequences associated with an incident, event,
or occurrence.'' TSA has determined that the higher-risk freight
railroads are those designated as Class I based on their revenue (over
$72.9 billion in 2013), as well as any freight railroad that transports
one or more of the categories of Rail Security-Sensitive Materials in a
high threat urban area. The Nation depends on these systems to move
freight in support of critical sectors and passengers.
TSA has determined the higher-risk rail transit systems and
passenger railroads in the context of resource allocations under the
Transit Security Grant Program using a model approved by the DHS
Secretary and vetted by Congress. These systems are all located in high
threat urban areas and carry the most passengers as a percentage of
daily ridership totals.
Although TSA continues to work with these industries to develop and
implement cybersecurity measures voluntarily, the industries have not
achieved 100 percent adoption of the recommended measures. To establish
a baseline of behavior for higher-risk operations to protect against
cyber-actors and ongoing cyberattacks against the transportation
sector, TSA worked with both private-sector and public-sector partners
to identify existing vulnerabilities, develop mitigation strategies and
cybersecurity measures, and install response and restore protocols to
more quickly address immediate threats through security directives.
Entities not covered by the security directives are still recommended
to implement the same measures through voluntary actions.
In accordance with the National Security Memorandum on Improving
Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Control Systems (Jul 29,
2021), TSA has issued these Security Directives due to the ongoing
cybersecurity threat to surface transportation systems and associated
infrastructure to prevent against the significant harm to the national
and economic security of the United States that could result from the
``degradation, destruction, or malfunction of systems that control this
infrastructure.'' In order to mitigate these threats, TSA believes
mandatory measures will ensure industry is taking appropriate actions
to mitigate potential vulnerabilities from the ongoing cybersecurity
threats.

Questions from Hon. Garret Graves to Victoria Newhouse, Deputy
Assistant Administrator for Policy, Plans, and Engagement,
Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Department of Homeland
Security

Question 8. Your testimony discusses information sharing between
TSA and the USCG to identify and manage threats in the Maritime
Transportation System (MTS). How does TSA communicate threats to our
individual ports as part of the effort to manage risks in the MTS?
Answer. USCG has primary responsibility to manage threats in the
Maritime Transportation System (MTS). If TSA has relevant threat
information affecting the MTS, it is made available to the USCG. TSA
also receives relevant threat information from the USCG for awareness.
TSA Surface inspectors and Field Intelligence Officers participate in
the quarterly Area Maritime Security Committee meetings, which include
facility security officers and other maritime stakeholders to share
intelligence and current maritime security and safety issues. Surface
inspectors also attend other maritime-related association meetings at
the local ports where similar information is shared.

Question 9. I've read reports that there are some 500,000 vacancies
for cybersecurity professionals in the U.S. workforce, making it nearly
impossible for us to get a handle on the next generation of threats.
Additionally, we've heard from industry that they feel that talent is
relegated to SCIFs in the federal government, fusion centers, and big
technology companies--preventing talent from being available to
critical infrastructure at the local level. What can we be doing to
rethink the workforce model for cybersecurity-specific professionals?
Answer. Cybersecurity touches all modes of critical infrastructure,
including transportation. TSA is working to expand the cybersecurity
workforce in a number of capacities including hiring cybersecurity
professionals to our Policy and Operational teams. Expanding TSA's
cyber threat analysis footprint supports TSA efforts to enhance cyber-
related intelligence analyses and products covering all modes of
transportation; strengthen cyber threat analysis by developing
integrated, repeatable processes for identification, analysis and
sharing of cyber incidents; and increase the engagement and sharing of
intelligence with stakeholders. Moving forward, the goal of all federal
agencies is to assist efforts private industry and at state and local
levels by ensuring information is classified at the lowest possible
level, which make information more accessible.
While DHS and TSA cannot directly influence the ability of
transportation providers to hire and retain cybersecurity
professionals, there may be options to create training and educational
opportunities that transportation providers could leverage to assist in
the development of their own workforces.

Questions from Hon. Michael Guest to Victoria Newhouse, Deputy
Assistant Administrator for Policy, Plans, and Engagement,
Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Department of Homeland
Security

Question 10. Each state has a designated CISA ``Protective Security
Advisor'' that coordinates with members of the critical infrastructure
community and works to help them prepare/defend against cyber-attacks.
Can you tell me about the interface your agencies have with these
Advisors and what role they play in your industries?
Answer. TSA works with both Protective Security Advisors (PSA) and
Cybersecurity Advisors (CSA) from CISA. TSA partnerships with regional
CSAs across the U.S. allow for an expanded coordination of expertise
and outreach into the transportation sector community. TSA has
collaborated at the regional level with CSAs in conducting a wide
variety of stakeholder and trade association cybersecurity related
workshops. Along with the CSA relationships, TSA is establishing a
surface transportation cyber information sharing network through the
development of the Surface Information Sharing Cell serving as the hub,
with spokes assuring engagement with organizations, including CISA and
voluntary industry partnerships, in each surface transportation mode
with necessary analytical support.
In one specific example of recent coordination, TSA partnered with
CISA PSAs to help raise industry awareness and to promote pipeline
owner/operators' participation in the Validated Architecture Design
Review program.

Question 11. Many industry stakeholders utilize early notification
networks. However, the public sector lacks a robust system to alert
private carriers or shippers of an attack across the system. To
critical infrastructure, the ability to limit damage seems crucial. Can
you expand on how early notification networks are used by the private
sector and why coordination with a federal government system is so
important?
Answer. Public/private partnerships are critical to prevent,
protect, mitigate, respond, and recover from cyber-actors' attempts to
disrupt the transportation sector or from ongoing cyberattacks to IT
and OT systems. These partnerships are important for a number of
reasons. First, information sharing. As a repository to collect
information on cybersecurity incidents, the federal government is able
to effectively analyze the information and send it out to other
impacted or potentially impacted parties. This may help to mitigate the
impact of an incident. Second, understanding incident impact/scope.
From the point of view of the impacted party, it may be difficult to
understand the scope of an incident. By sharing, the federal government
is able to piece together disparate pieces of information and fully
understand the full impact of an incident. Third, coordinated response.
The federal government's role in a cybersecurity incident will be to
coordinate the response effectively at the federal level, and all the
way down to the local level. In each of these cases, it is important to
keep in mind that all of this is possible due to the relationships
built between government agencies, as well as with private companies.
TSA continues to work with federal government partners and private-
sector transportation stakeholders to limit cyber related disruptions.
TSA routinely coordinates the sharing of both non-classified and
classified security information as appropriate with its transportation
sector partners. This includes the identification of new
vulnerabilities and the sharing of known mitigation measures to close
the identified security gaps.
Additionally, as recommended by the Surface Transportation Security
Advisory Committee to the TSA Administrator, TSA has begun to establish
a surface transportation cyber information sharing network on threats,
incidents, and security concerns and related alerts, advisories,
analyses, and assessments. This includes the establishment of the
Surface Information Sharing Cell to serve as the hub, with spokes
assuring engagement with organizations in each surface transportation
mode, for the exchange of reporting, analyses, advisories, and alerts
on cyber threats, incidents, and security concerns--with necessary
analytical support.

Questions from Hon. Frederica S. Wilson to Rear Admiral John W. Mauger,
Assistant Commandant for Prevention Policy, U.S. Coast Guard

Question 1. Admiral Mauger: Thank you for your service and today's
testimony. As chair of the Florida Ports Caucus and a strong supporter
of PortMiami in South Florida, protecting the maritime industry is very
important to me. You mentioned that MTSA-regulated vessels and
facilities are required to report transportation security incidents,
breaches of security, and suspicious activity without delay. How
effective has this provision been in helping the Coast Guard protect
our maritime industry and could similar provisions help improve
cybersecurity in other transportation sectors?
Answer. The timely reporting of Transportation Security Incidents
(TSI), Breaches of Security, and Suspicious Activity, to include cyber
incidents, by regulated vessels and facilities has proven effective and
allowed the Coast Guard to respond and, where necessary, deploy
resources, while also coordinating with other agencies as appropriate.
In 2016, the Coast Guard released a policy letter expanding on the
regulatory requirement for cyber incident reporting, which includes
more information on how to identify whether a cyber-incident is
considered a TSI, Breach of Security, or Suspicious Activity. This
policy letter also outlines that Coast Guard regulated entities can
report incidents to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA) in lieu of the Coast Guard. This is similar to the
reporting mechanism established through the Transportation Security
Administration's security directives. This policy remains in effect
today, and the Coast Guard may further refine it as government and
industry experience with cyber incident reporting continues to grow.
Details from a reported cyber incident, after vetting, may be
incorporated into a Maritime Cyber Alert or other suitable messaging to
share with the broader community to raise awareness of potential
threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences to the Marine Transportation
System (MTS), or through CISA to all sectors of critical
infrastructure.
The provisions are only mandatory for vessels and facilities
subject to Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA), which
does not capture all components of the MTS. Similar provisions could
improve cybersecurity awareness in other transportation sectors, or for
a broader portion of the MTS, so long as reporting requirements are
clear. This is particularly the case if multiple agencies have a role
in regulations and oversight of a transportation sector. The
Administration also supports efforts to mandate the reporting of cyber
incidents to critical infrastructure and the timely sharing of those
incidents with Sector Risk Management Agencies.

Questions from Hon. Garret Graves to Rear Admiral John W. Mauger,
Assistant Commandant for Prevention Policy, U.S. Coast Guard

Question 2. Your testimony discusses information sharing between
the U.S. Coast Guard and TSA to identify and manage threats in the
Maritime Transportation System (MTS). How does the USCG communicate
threats to our individual ports as part of the effort to manage risks
in the MTS?
Answer. The Coast Guard leverages several mechanisms for
communicating threats to our ports and MTS stakeholders, whether the
threats are to the MTS at-large, or to specific stakeholders.
Communication can take the shape of Marine Safety Information
Bulletins, Maritime Cyber Alerts, Coast Guard messages, articles, etc.
Dissemination of the information, regardless of form, can go through
multiple avenues based on need. These include Area Maritime Security
Committees, Port Security Specialists and Cyber Coordinators/Advisors
at the Area, District, and Sector level to pass information to their
network of contacts, CISA, the Maritime Transportation System
Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MTS-ISAC), Partners within the
Government Coordinating Council and Sector Coordinating Council, and
through other Sector Risk Management Agencies.

Question 3. Lack of resources and personnel has been a hurdle for
the U.S. Coast Guard to adapt to securing the MTS from cyber threats as
opposed to traditional facilities security. Has the U.S. Coast Guard
investigated opportunities to coordinate (and consolidate) its existing
cybersecurity initiatives across U.S. Coast Guard mission areas?
Answer. The Coast Guard continually reviews opportunities to
coordinate and consolidate new and existing cybersecurity initiatives
across mission areas. The Service recently published the 2021 Cyber
Strategic Outlook (CSO), which charts the path to meet the challenges
of a rapidly evolving cyber domain. Key to the CSO are three lines of
effort: (1) Defend and Operate the Enterprise Mission Platform, (2)
Protect the Marine Transportation System, and (3) Operate In and
Through Cyberspace. The Coast Guard continues to operationalize Marine
Transportation System cyber risk management from the headquarters
program level to the port level, including the incorporation of
cybersecurity into the Service's prevention and response framework.

Question 4. The U.S. Coast Guard uses the FEMA National Incident
Management System (NIMS) for physical security. Is the Coast Guard
working with FEMA to update NIMS to respond to cyber incidents?
Answer. Yes. The Coast Guard is working with other U.S. Department
of Homeland Security components, including the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and CISA, to examine the application of the National
Incident Management System as well as the National Cyber Incident
Response Plan to cyber incident response.

Question 5. It is my understanding that there is a current U.S.
Coast Guard-led Research and Development effort to develop a Threat
Intelligence Partnership for the Maritime Transportation System. Could
you provide an update on this partnership and detail how this system is
anticipated to be deployed to protect the MTS?
Answer. The Threat Intelligence Partnership is a Research and
Development effort to develop technology that improves data analytics
and information systems to better inform Marine Transportation System
entities of threats and provide recommended actionable improvements to
security. The system concept is in the early stages of development with
additional analysis required to determine when a production system
might be available. The project, and the experience of developing it
thus far, has confirmed a need to improve collaboration with U.S.
Government partners in the areas of critical infrastructure,
cybersecurity, homeland security, and maritime commerce.
This project is sponsored by Coast Guard Intelligence, funded by
the Naval Information Warfare Command, contracted through the Naval
Research Laboratories, and involves Louisiana State University and the
Stevenson Technology Corporation.

Question 6. The Maritime Transportation System community wants
actionable guidance from the U.S. Coast Guard on what they need to be
doing to protect against an ever more diverse set of cyber threats. Has
the U.S. Coast Guard investigated opportunities to provide (or require)
cybersecurity training to our maritime industries and ports, as the
U.S. Coast Guard currently requires trainings on physical and
facilities security?
Answer. Per Title 33 of the Code of Federal Regulations, vessel and
facility security personnel and non-security personnel can obtain
baseline security knowledge requirements through training or equivalent
job experience. Existing guidance in NVIC 01-20 ``Guidelines for
Addressing Cyber Risks at Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA)
Regulated Facilities'' recommends that Facility Security Plans describe
how cybersecurity is included as part of personnel training, policies,
and procedures, and how this material will be kept current and
monitored for effectiveness.
There is no Coast Guard-developed or approved cybersecurity
training for industry. The Coast Guard shares local training
opportunities through Area Maritime Security Committees at the port
level.
The Coast Guard will consider training requirements as it evaluates
future cyber regulations for the marine transportation system.

Question 7. I've read reports that there are some 500,000 vacancies
for cybersecurity professionals in the U.S. workforce, making it nearly
impossible for us to get a handle on the next generation of threats.
Additionally, we've heard from industry that they feel that talent is
relegated to SCIFs in the federal government, fusion centers, and big
technology companies--preventing talent from being available to
critical infrastructure at the local level. What can we be doing to
rethink the workforce model for cybersecurity-specific professionals?
Answer. The Coast Guard is working to ensure the Service's cyber
workforce is well-trained, effective, and retains talent using
workforce retention interventions (bonuses) for active duty and
civilian members to provide compensation commensurate to civilian
counterparts. Additionally, the Coast Guard is augmenting the cyber
workforce with Reserve and Auxiliary members to ensure adequate surge
capacity and providing opportunities to attain sought after
certifications and training opportunities within the Cyberspace
operations. The Coast Guard's workforce management initiatives continue
to evolve to meet the demands of a fast paced and growing cyber
community and our cyber professionals are fully prepared to meet the
Service's needs.

Questions from Hon. Michael Guest to Rear Admiral John W. Mauger,
Assistant Commandant for Prevention Policy, U.S. Coast Guard

Question 8. In your testimony you reference a shared responsibility
between Coast Guard and private industry. You list ``conducting
vulnerability assessments,'' ``Exercising plans,'' and ``reporting
cyber incidents'' as ways Coast Guard CYBER interacts with industry
stakeholders to boost or assess cybersecurity plans. On October 1, the
Coast Guard launched reviews of Facility Security Assessments and
Facility Security Plans of MTSA-regulated facilities (Maritime
Transportation Security Act).
a.  Prior to this initiative, could you give me a percentage of
facilities that actively cooperated with Coast Guard on these plans?
Answer. Beginning October 1st, 2021, facilities were required to
have cybersecurity incorporated, along with physical security, at their
first annual audit. Before that, the Coast Guard did not have clear
visibility as to whether or not facilities incorporated cybersecurity
into their overall security posture. Some facilities opted to include
cybersecurity in their required Facility Security Assessments and
Facility Security Plans, but the number is estimated to be less than 2
percent, and the degree to which cybersecurity was incorporated varied
from facility to facility. Additionally, a lack of cybersecurity
inclusion in Facility Security Assessments (FSA) and Facility Security
Plans (FSP) does not necessarily mean that some facilities were not
still considering cybersecurity.

b.  Additionally, is there any incentive or penalties for
facilities if they do not conduct assessments or adhere to industry
standards if they are attacked, especially for MTSA-regulated
facilities?
Answer. Facilities were provided with a 1-year period, ending
September 30, 2022, to incorporate cybersecurity into their FSAs and
FSPs, since no previous guidance existed. Beginning October 1, 2022,
all facilities must be in compliance, and will be subject to action by
Captains of the Ports (COTP) in cases of non-compliance. Options
available to COTPs include issuing deficiencies, imposing fines, and
civil penalties. The COTP may place operational controls on the
facility and/or seek enforcement actions (Letter of Warning, Notice of
Violation, Civil Penalty) on the owner/operator of the MTSA-regulated
facility.

Question 9. The National Cyber Director, Director Chris Inglis,
also emphasized the need for accountability in cybersecurity practices.
Each one of you represents a different set of industry stakeholders
with vastly different needs in this space.
a.  For bad actors within your jurisdiction that allow their
cybersecurity measures to fall below public or industry standards, what
are ways that Congress and your agencies can hold those folks
accountable?
Answer. Title 33, Code of Federal Regulations parts 105 and 106,
which implement MTSA of 2002, require regulated facilities to maintain
an approved FSP. Existing regulations require owners and operators of
MTSA-regulated facilities to analyze vulnerabilities associated with
radio and telecommunication equipment, including computer systems and
networks, otherwise known as cybersecurity. When cybersecurity
vulnerabilities are identified, an owner or operator demonstrates
compliance by providing its cybersecurity mitigation procedures in the
FSP. When a MTSA-regulated facility is found to not be following the
measures or procedures noted in their FSP, or are otherwise not in
compliance with the relevant regulations, the Captain of the Port may
place operational controls on the facility and/or seek enforcement
actions (Letter of Warning, Notice of Violation, Civil Penalty) on the
owner/operator of the MTSA-regulated facility.

b.  Many stakeholders mention that they are more robust in
developing cybersecurity measures and have been for decades. So, what
are ways to hold bad actors accountable without installing mandates
that may limit the private sector's own work in this space?
Answer. Although the MTSA regulations in 33 CFR parts 105 and 106
are mandatory, it is up to each facility to determine how to identify,
assess, and address the vulnerabilities of their computer systems and
networks. While there is a baseline of what is required, this does not
limit individual facilities from implementing additional protective
measures. For example, each individual facility should determine the
organizational structure; number of employees; the employee roles,
responsibilities, and access permissions; and, the employee training
needed so that its security personnel can address the facility's cyber
security risks. Each facility should also determine how, and where, its
data is stored and, if it is stored offsite, whether the data has a
critical link to the safety and/or security functions of the facility.
If such a critical link exists, the facility should address any
vulnerabilities. Other motivating efforts include engaging stakeholders
through multi-agency, multi-stakeholder initiatives such as Area
Maritime Security Committees, Harbor Safety Committees, and others that
encourage mutual efforts to bolster cyber risk management throughout
the MTS.

Question 10. Each state has a designated CISA ``Protective Security
Advisor'' that coordinates with members of the critical infrastructure
community and works to help them prepare/defend against cyber-attacks.
Can you tell me about the interface your agencies have with these
Advisors and what role they play in your industries?
Answer. The Coast Guard interfaces with CISA Protective Security
Advisors (PSA), Cybersecurity Advisors (CSA), and other CISA regional
personnel through the Area Maritime Security Committees (AMSCs) as well
as other Coast Guard points of contact. AMSCs are required by federal
regulations and serve an essential coordinating function during normal
operations and emergency response. They are comprised of government
agency and maritime industry leaders, and serve as the primary local
means to jointly evaluate cyber risks, share threat information, and
participate in cyber preparedness exercises. Coast Guard field
personnel work collaboratively with PSAs, CSAs, and other regional
personnel as needed, the AMSC, during Regional Resiliency Assessment
Programs, interagency/stakeholder meetings, local exercises, training
offerings, incidents, and special events. As there is a cyber-physical
security convergence with many threats we face as a country, the PSAs
and CSAs work together to bring that combined expertise, as well as
tools and resources, to our maritime partners.

Question 11. Many industry stakeholders utilize early notification
networks. However, the public sector lacks a robust system to alert
private carriers or shippers of an attack across the system. To
critical infrastructure, the ability to limit damage seems crucial. Can
you expand on how early notification networks are used by the private
sector and why coordination with a federal government system is so
important?
Answer. The evolving nature of cyber threats and vulnerabilities
includes the fact that incidents affecting one component of the MTS, or
other critical infrastructure sectors, could quickly and easily affect
other components. Early and detailed notifications enable responding
agencies and stakeholders to quickly assess, respond to, and recover
from a cybersecurity incident while allowing others to take appropriate
steps to prepare for and mitigate such incidents. Multiple government
agencies respond to cybersecurity incidents, which necessitates timely
reporting and shared information to facilitate a coordinated response.
Early notifications enable Coast Guard COTP to evaluate risks
associated with a cybersecurity incident and deploy resources or impose
appropriate operational controls when necessary (i.e. halt transfer
operations, require tug boats to assist a ship, etc.). Early
notifications also allow the Coast Guard's Cyber Command to support the
impacted company remotely or deploy a specialized Cyber Protection Team
to help them with the technical aspects of their assessment and
response.
Notification networks include the Coast Guard's National Response
Center, where MTSA-regulated facilities are required to report
Transportation Security Incidents, Breaches of Security, and Suspicious
Activity, to include cybersecurity events. Additionally, CISA receives
and shares reports of cybersecurity incidents. In addition to agency
messaging, the MTS-ISAC assists in the dissemination of key information
to stakeholders.

Questions from Hon. Frederica S. Wilson to Kevin Dorsey, Assistant
Inspector General for Information Technology Audits, Office of
Inspector General, U.S. Department of Transportation

Question 1. Mr. Dorsey, in your testimony, you highlighted that
DOT's weaknesses can be attributed to its lack of progress in
addressing previous audit recommendations. Between 2017 and 2020, the
number of weaknesses more than doubled to over 10,000 under the
previous administration. How will the $2 billion that was provided
under the Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act help the Biden
administration address this problem and how can DOT prevent such a
sharp increase in the future?
Answer. While the Act provides $2 billion for funding cybersecurity
improvements and other critical infrastructure needs, we do not have
any ongoing work that would allow us to assess how this funding may
help address the weaknesses identified in my testimony. As my testimony
stated, we made an overarching recommendation to DOT to require the
Office of the Chief Information Officer to develop a multiyear strategy
and approach--complete with objective milestones and resource
commitments--to implement the necessary corrective actions to address
these weaknesses and ensure an effective information security program.
Implementing this recommendation will allow the Department to
prioritize these weaknesses and calculate the resources necessary for
resolving recurring cybersecurity issues while also addressing new
concerns as they arise. An effective information security program will
help DOT mitigate risks of cyberattacks and prevent such a sharp
increase of recurring cybersecurity issues in the future.

Question from Hon. Garret Graves to Kevin Dorsey, Assistant Inspector
General for Information Technology Audits, Office of Inspector General,
U.S. Department of Transportation

Question 2. I've read reports that there are some 500,000 vacancies
for cybersecurity professionals in the U.S. workforce, making it nearly
impossible for us to get a handle on the next generation of threats.
Additionally, we've heard from industry that they feel that talent is

rethink the workforce model for cybersecurity-specific professionals?
Answer. While DOT OIG does not have any ongoing work regarding the
workforce model for cybersecurity-specific professionals, this
challenge is not unique to DOT. GAO has recognized cybersecurity among
the mission-critical skills gaps that contribute to the placement of
Strategic Human Capital Management on its annual High Risk List report.
Moreover, as illustrated by the examples of cyberattacks on local
government and private infrastructure noted in my testimony, there is
an acute need for cybersecurity talent outside the Federal Government.
As to the Federal workforce, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
recently launched the Cybersecurity Talent Management System (CTMS) to
help it recruit, develop, and retain top cybersecurity professionals.
If proven successful, this could serve as a model to be adopted
elsewhere.

Question 3. Each state has a designated CISA ``Protective Security
Advisor'' that coordinates with members of the critical infrastructure
community and works to help them prepare/defend against cyber-attacks.
Can you tell me about the interface your agencies have with these
Advisors and what role they play in your industries?
Answer. The CISA Protective Security Advisor meets with Department
staff. Given the Office of Inspector General's independent role, we do
not interface with the advisor. This question would be best answered by
someone at the Department level.

Question 4. Many industry stakeholders utilize early notification
networks. However, the public sector lacks a robust system to alert
private carriers or shippers of an attack across the system. To
critical infrastructure, the ability to limit damage seems crucial. Can
you expand on how early notification networks are used by the private
sector and why coordination with a federal government system is so
important?
Answer. While our office does not have any ongoing work
specifically related to early notification networks used by the private
sector, the importance of DOT's coordination with the private sector to
enhance cybersecurity is clear. As I stated in my testimony, DOT is a
lead agency, along with DHS, in protecting the critical infrastructure
of the Nation's transportation sector. As such, DOT must partner
effectively with other Federal agencies and the private sector to
mitigate vulnerabilities and ensure a robust cybersecurity posture. For
example, the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 directs
FAA to develop a comprehensive, strategic framework to reduce
cybersecurity risks to civil aviation. FAA's efforts to implement this
framework involve coordinating and collaborating on aviation
cybersecurity with DHS and the Department of Defense through the
Aviation Cyber Initiative. Protecting flight-critical systems--and the
safety of the flying public--from rapidly evolving cyber-based threats
also requires the cooperation of aviation stakeholders from industry,
airlines, airports, and manufacturers. This is a good start, but it is
only one step in what will be necessary for the development of a robust
coordination effort between the private sector and the Federal
Government to protect the transportation sector's critical
infrastructure.

Questions from Hon. Steve Cohen to Nick Marinos, Director, Information
Technology and Cybersecurity, U.S. Government Accountability Office

Question 1. In July, GAO highlighted pipeline-related weaknesses
that stemmed from TSA's own internal policies, which included
conducting risk assessments with incomplete information and using
protocols for responding to pipeline incidents that had not been
revised since 2010. Is there anything you would like to add regarding
GAO's review of these issues?
Answer. In July 2021, we testified that the Transportation Security
Administration (TSA), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS),
had not fully addressed pipeline cybersecurity-related weaknesses that
GAO had previously identified, such as incomplete information for
pipeline risk assessments and aged protocols for responding to pipeline
security incidents.\1\ Fully addressing our recommendations will better
ensure that TSA's actions are well-coordinated with other federal
agencies in response to a pipeline-related physical or cyber incident,
and that pipeline stakeholders understand federal agencies' roles and
responsibilities in helping pipeline owner/operators to restore service
after a pipeline-related physical or cyber incident.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ GAO, Critical Infrastructure Protection: TSA Is Taking Steps to
Address Some Pipeline Security Program Weaknesses, GAO-21-105263
(Washington, D.C.: July 27, 2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Specifically, GAO reports in 2018 and 2019 identified weaknesses in
TSA's oversight and guidance, and made 13 recommendations to address
those weaknesses.\2\ TSA concurred with GAO's recommendations. As of
November 2021, TSA had implemented 10 of the 13 recommendations but had
not implemented the following:

\2\ GAO, Critical Infrastructure Protection: Key Pipeline Security
Documents Need to Reflect Current Operating Environment, GAO-19-426
(Washington, D.C.: June 5, 2019) and Critical Infrastructure
Protection: Actions Needed to Address Significant Weaknesses in TSA's
Pipeline Security Program Management, GAO-19-48 (Washington, D.C.: Dec.
18, 2018).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  In 2018, we recommended that TSA should identify or develop
other data sources relevant to threat, vulnerability, and consequence
consistent with DHS's critical infrastructure risk mitigation
priorities and incorporate that data into the Pipeline Relative Risk
Ranking Tool to assess relative risk of critical pipeline systems. As
of July 2021, TSA officials reported meeting with representatives from
DHS and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to obtain their
input on the identification of sources relevant to threat,
vulnerability and consequence consistent with DHS's priorities.
According to TSA officials, further action on this recommendation had
been limited due to the agency's work on the pandemic response and the
lack of funding for contractor support.
2.  In 2018, we also recommended that TSA should take steps to
coordinate an independent, external peer review of its Pipeline
Relative Risk Ranking Tool. As of July 2021, DHS officials stated that
TSA intends to take steps to coordinate an independent, external peer
review of its Pipeline Relative Risk Ranking Tool after the agency has
addressed the above-mentioned open recommendation.
3.  In 2019, we recommended that TSA periodically review, and as
appropriate, update the 2010 Pipeline Security and Incident Recovery
Protocol Plan to ensure the plan reflects relevant changes in pipeline
security threats (including those related to cybersecurity),
technology, federal law and policy, and any other factors relevant to
the security of the nation's pipeline systems. According to TSA
officials, as of August 2021, the agency had completed a review of the
2010 Pipeline Security and Incident Recovery Protocol Plan and
determined that updates were needed.

We will continue to monitor TSA's efforts to implement our
recommendations.

Question 2. We have heard numerous reports of local governments
being targeted by ransomware and other cybersecurity threats. Local
agencies may be especially under-prepared to respond to the increasing
level of risk. As you know, the bipartisan infrastructure bill we
passed into law allocates $1 billion to improve state and local
government cybersecurity through a new Department of Homeland Security
grant program. Can you discuss how this funding may impact local
transportation agencies and if you have any recommendations for how the
federal government can better assist or coordinate with state and local
governments' cybersecurity efforts?
Answer. Increased funding may help to improve cybersecurity and
critical infrastructure for transportation agencies through grants to
states, local, tribal, and territorial governments from the State and
Local Cybersecurity Grant Program established by the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act.\3\ The act also calls for the establishment of
the Safety Data Initiative to promote the use of data integration, data
visualization, and advanced analytics for surface transportation safety
through the development of innovative practices and products for use by
federal, state, and local entities. This initiative is designed to
encourage the sharing of data between and among federal, state, and
local transportation agencies.

\3\ Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L. No 117-58, 135
Stat. 429, 1272, Sec.  70612 (2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally, the act also requires GAO to conduct a review of the
State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program including the grant
selection process by DHS and a sample of grants awarded. In light of
your interest in state and local governments' cybersecurity efforts, we
will reach out to your office during our review of the program.
On the subject of federal assistance to state and local
governments' cybersecurity efforts, DHS's Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) created CISA Central to be a
unified portal and point of contact for critical infrastructure
partners and stakeholders to contact CISA and request assistance.\4\
Furthermore, as the lead agency responsible for overseeing domestic
critical infrastructure protection efforts, CISA's ability to
effectively coordinate and consult with federal agencies; state, local,
territorial, and tribal governments; and the private sector is
critical. Consequently, in March 2021, we reported on CISA's
organizational transformation initiative and its ability to coordinate
effectively with stakeholders.\5\ Among other things, we reported on a
number of challenges that selected government and private-sector
stakeholders had noted when coordinating with CISA, including the lack
of stakeholder involvement in developing guidance.

Needed to Ensure Organizational Changes Result in More Effective
Cybersecurity for Our Nation, GAO-21-236 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 10,

To address these and other weaknesses, we made 11 recommendations
to DHS. Of these, three recommendations directly related to challenges
reported by stakeholders. The department concurred with our
recommendations and, as of September 2021, reported that it intends to
implement them by the end of calendar year 2022. As part of our ongoing
work, we will continue to monitor CISA's efforts to carry out its
mission to identify and respond to cyber and other risks to our
nation's infrastructure.

Question 3. I've read reports that there are some 500,000 vacancies
for cybersecurity professionals in the U.S. workforce, making it nearly
impossible for us to get a handle on the next generation of threats.
Additionally, we've heard from industry that they feel that talent is
relegated to SCIFs in the federal government, fusion centers, and big
technology companies--preventing talent from being available to
critical infrastructure at the local level. What can we be doing to
rethink the workforce model for cybersecurity-specific professionals?
Answer. Prior GAO reports have pointed out that the federal
government and private industry face a persistent shortage of
cybersecurity-specific professionals to combat cyber threats.\6\ In
November 2021, we reported that a potential method for developing a
talented and diverse cadre of digital-ready, tech-savvy federal
employees is the creation of a digital service academy--similar to
military academies--to train future civil servants in the digital
skills needed to modernize government.\7\ For example, staff with
knowledge, skills, and abilities to secure digital services could help
agencies more effectively manage risks associated with the
cybersecurity of systems in a cloud environment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ See, for example, GAO, High-Risk Series: Federal Government
Needs to Urgently Pursue Critical Actions to Address Major
Cybersecurity Challenges, GAO-21-288 (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 24, 2021).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Cyberspace Solarium Commission has made recommendations related
to cybersecurity workforce management challenges, including that the
U.S. government should take a number of cyber-oriented actions, such as
expanding federal cyber training programs.\8\ Particularly, the
Commission recommended that DHS, the National Science Foundation, and
the Office of Personnel Management expand the CyberCorps: Scholarship
for Service program, which agencies could use to increase the supply of
cybersecurity talent. This program provides scholarships and stipends
to undergraduate and graduate students who are pursuing information
security-related degrees, in exchange for up to three years of federal
service after graduation.\9\ In particular, the program is designed to
recruit and train the next generation of IT professionals to meet the
needs of the cybersecurity mission for federal, state, local, and
tribal governments.

Question 4. DOD has been implementing the Cybersecurity Maturity
Model Certification (CMMC), requiring CMMC credentials to qualify a
bidder for a federal contract and therefore providing additional
security to our federal systems. However, a downside to the CMMC system
is the financial burden of obtaining credentials, which hurts small
businesses in their efforts to receive DOD Contracts. As credentialing
spreads across other areas of the federal government, including to DOT,
do you have any suggestions for how other agencies can learn from the
DOD CMMC process to ensure a high degree of cyber security for our
contractors, while ensuring that small businesses have an opportunity
to participate in federal contracting?
Answer. In December 2021, we reported that the Department of
Defense's (DOD) Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)
process is ongoing due, in part, to delays in certifying assessors as
well as concerns from small businesses.\10\ The scope of the work we
have conducted so far has not directly related to how other federal
agencies can learn from the DOD CMMC process and ensure small
businesses have opportunities to participate in federal contracting.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\10\ GAO, Defense Contractor Cybersecurity: Stakeholder
Communication and Performance Goals Could Improve Certification
Framework, GAO-22-104679 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 8, 2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nevertheless, during the course of our review of DOD's
implementation of CMMC, government and industry representatives raised
a number of issues that are important to the future course of CMMC.
They include CMMC adoption by other federal agencies. In particular,
monitoring efforts other federal agencies are considering or taking to
adopt CMMC or similar requirements for their supply chains. In
addition, industry--especially, small businesses--expressed a range of
concerns about CMMC implementation, such as costs and assessment
consistency. For example, during our discussion group with small
defense contractors, a participant told us that small businesses may
consider the added cost and competitive uncertainty as incentives to
exit the government contracts marketplace. While DOD engaged with
industry in refining early versions of CMMC, it had not provided
sufficient details and timely communication on implementation. Until
DOD improves this communication, industry will be challenged to
implement protections for DOD's sensitive data.

Questions from Hon. Michael Guest to Nick Marinos, Director,
Information Technology and Cybersecurity, U.S. Government
Accountability Office

Question 5. Each state has a designated CISA ``Protective Security
Advisor'' that coordinates with members of the critical infrastructure
community and works to help them prepare/defend against cyber-attacks.
Can you tell me about the interface your agencies have with these
Advisors and what role they play in your industries?
Answer. As a legislative branch agency, GAO does not interface with
CISA's Protective Security Advisor (PSA) program unless there is a
request by congressional committees or subcommittees, or is statutorily
required by public laws or committee reports.
For fiscal year 2020, CISA's PSA program expended approximately
$38.5 million and had 127 staff. Specifically, CISA is increasing its
presence in the form of staff who work directly with critical
infrastructure partners and communities at the regional, state, tribal,
and local level. These staff include local and regional Protective
Security Advisors and Cybersecurity Advisors, among other personnel,
based in 10 regional offices.\11\ These advisors support critical
infrastructure owners and operators by providing products and services,
such as assessments, training, exercises, and workshops. For example,
Cybersecurity Advisors provide briefings and assessments of
cybersecurity and resilience for owners and operators.\12\ In addition,
Protective Security Advisors, complete surveys and assessments that
help identify the security and resilience of individual owners' and
operators' facilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ CISA's regional offices also include Emergency Communications
Coordinators who support federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial
government public safety communications mission partners.
\12\ A cyber resilience review assessment is a nontechnical
assessment to evaluate an organization's operational resilience and
cybersecurity practices.

Question 6. Many industry stakeholders utilize early notification
networks. However, the public sector lacks a robust system to alert
private carriers or shippers of an attack across the system. To
critical infrastructure, the ability to limit damage seems crucial. Can
you expand on how early notification networks are used by the private
sector and why coordination with a federal government system is so
important?
Answer. The importance of having early notification that a
cybersecurity incident is occurring on a network is highlighted in the
May 2021 Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity,
issued by the White House.\13\ The executive order requires the federal
government to employ all appropriate resources and authorities to
maximize the early detection of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and
incidents on its networks. While this topic of how early notification
networks are being used by the private sector is outside the scope of
the work we have conducted so far, we will be glad to discuss a
potential request for future work on this topic with your staff.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\ The White House, Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity,
Executive Order 14028 (Washington, D.C.: May 12, 2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the subject of federal coordination with the private sector, in
November 2021, we reported that CISA has a leadership role in
coordinating federal efforts intended to aid in the resilience of the
Communications Sector, an integral component of the U.S. economy, which
faces serious cyber-related threats that could affect the operations of
local, regional, and national level networks.\14\ The agency fulfills
its responsibilities to private sector owners and operators through a
variety of programs and services, including incident management and
information sharing. With respect to incident management, CISA is
responsible for coordinating federal activities to support
Communications Sector infrastructure owners and operators during
incidents, such as outages caused by severe weather. With respect to
information sharing, in addition to managing federal coordination
during incidents impacting the Communications Sector, CISA shares
information with sector stakeholders to enhance their cybersecurity and
improve interoperability, situational awareness, and preparedness for
responding to and managing incidents.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\14\ GAO, Critical Infrastructure Protection: CISA Should Assess
the Effectiveness of its Actions to Support the Communications Sector,
GAO-22-104462 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 23, 2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We found that CISA had not assessed the effectiveness of such
activities, despite DHS recommending that they to do so every four
years. As such, we made three recommendations to CISA, including that
the agency assess the effectiveness of support provided to the sector,
and revise the sector plan to include new and emerging threats and
risks, among other things. DHS concurred with the recommendations and
described initial actions under way and plans to address them in
response to our report.
