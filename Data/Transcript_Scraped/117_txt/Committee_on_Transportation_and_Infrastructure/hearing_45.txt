LOn August 5, 2021, President Biden approved a
more than $3.26 billion increase for the Hazard Mitigation
Grant Program (HMGP) \2\, which was authorized by COVID-19
major disaster declarations.\3\ The approval makes states
eligible for HMGP funds with a 75 percent federal share that
equal 4 percent of their COVID-19 disaster costs.\4\ This one-
time investment represents a 23 percent increase in HMGP
funding made available for declared disasters since the
program's inception in 1988; \5\

LOn September 2, 2021, FEMA announced it will now
accept additional forms of documentation to verify the
occupancy and ownership requirements of disaster survivors
seeking Individual Assistance (IA).\6\ The policy change has
made IA more accessible to underserved communities and
homeowners that do not have access to a deed or formal proof of
homeownership.\7\ The agency will also now provide Other Needs
Assistance (ONA) grants to qualifying homeowners and renters
that sustained real property damage but did not render their
home uninhabitable; revise inspection procedures and training
to better identify and address disaster caused mold; and
expanded assistance for disaster caused disability; \8\

FEMA'S 2022-2026 STRATEGIC PLAN

Every four years FEMA publishes a strategic plan to outline
the agency's vision and identify three goals to address
challenges. FEMA engaged with a diverse range of stakeholders,
including Tribes, FEMA employees, and external partners to
develop the 2022-2026 Strategic Plan.\15\ FEMA collected public
input through a Climate and Equity Request for Information.\16\
Upon review of the feedback, Administrator Criswell identified
the following goals as FEMA's priorities for 2022-2026.\17\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GOAL 1: INSTILL EQUITY AS A FOUNDATION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency
Assistance Act (Stafford Act, P.L. 93-288, as amended) requires
FEMA assistance to be delivered in an equitable manner without
discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion,
nationality, sex, age, disability, language accessibility, or
economic status.\18\ The Strategic Plan recognizes that FEMA's
programs are not being implemented equitably and asserts that
the agency will work to achieve equity.\19\ To meet this
objective, FEMA plans to curate a workforce that reflects the
nation's diversity, remove barriers to FEMA programs so that
they can be effectively accessed and leveraged by underserved
communities, and allocate resources to eliminate disparate
program outcomes.\20\ FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure
and Communities (BRIC) and Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA)
were selected during the interim implementation stage for Biden
Administration's pilot Justice 40 Initiative, which aims to
provide at least 40 percent of program benefits to
disadvantaged communities.\21\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GOAL 2: LEAD THE WHOLE COMMUNITY IN CLIMATE RESILIENCE

Climate change and the increasing frequency and severity of
natural disasters impacted an already prolonged amount of time
it takes for communities to recover from a disaster.\22\ FEMA
plans to make the whole emergency management community more
climate literate and resilient by building a foundational
understanding of climate science and climate adaptation
strategies, developing tools to anticipate climate risk,
allocating resources informed by future risk estimates, and
targeting investments to build resilience and enhance
equity.\23\ The Strategic Plan highlights that building to
modern hazard resistant codes and standards is also key to
avoiding future losses.\24\

GOAL 3: PROMOTE AND SUSTAIN A READY FEMA AND PREPARED NATION

The new frequency and intensity of natural disasters has
stressed FEMA's workforce.\26\ The change in tempo was marked
by the 2017 hurricane and wildfire seasons and has kept pace
due to the nationwide COVID-19 major disaster declaration and
other major hazard events such as the 2020 wildfire season and
Hurricane Ida in 2021.\27\ Prior to the 2017 disaster season
FEMA was managing 26 emergency and major disaster declarations;
by November 2020 it was managing 166 emergency and major
disaster declarations.\28\ To meet this challenge, FEMA plans
to increase capacity at the community level by implementing
revised training initiatives, recruiting a more diverse FEMA
workforce, developing a comprehensive readiness framework, and
improving interagency coordination to streamline the delivery
of disaster assistance.\29\

SUMMARY OF FEMA STAKEHOLDER PRIORITIES FOR 2022:

On February 16, 2022, the Committee received testimony from
emergency management stakeholders and the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) during the hearing titled ``FEMA
priorities for 2022: Stakeholder Perspectives.'' \30\ The
Committee received testimony from 16 additional stakeholder for
the hearing record. The testimony provided recommendations to
FEMA regarding all four phases of emergency management:
mitigation, planning, response, and recovery.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\30\ Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and
Emergency Management. (February 16, 2022). Hearing: FEMA Priorities for
2022: Stakeholder Perspectives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testimony submitted by the National Emergency Management
Association (NEMA) underscored that FEMA's programs, policies,
and response strategies have not kept pace with the heightened
threat of wildfire exacerbated by climate change and an
expanding wildland urban interface.\31\ Testimony submitted by
the International Association of Emergency Managers (IAEM)
praised FEMA's priorities for the 2022-2026 Strategic plan and
reiterated the need to consider equity in all FEMA
programs.\32\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\31\ Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and
Emergency Management. (February 16, 2022). Hearing: FEMA Priorities for
2022: Stakeholder Perspectives. Testimony submitted by Erica Bornemann.
\32\ Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and
Emergency Management. (February 16, 2022). Hearing: FEMA Priorities for
2022: Stakeholder Perspectives. Testimony submitted by Carolyn
Harshman.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
GAO's testimony identified four areas for improvement
within FEMA: workforce management, long-term recovery,
potential barriers to assistance and disparate recovery
outcomes, and disaster resilience and mitigation.\33\ GAO
identified these priority areas using evidence it has gathered
while drafting reports and recommendations during the 2015-2022
period.\34\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\33\ Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and
Emergency Management. (February 16, 2022). Hearing: FEMA Priorities for
2022: Stakeholder Perspectives. Testimony submitted by Chris Currie.
\34\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To improve workforce management, GAO recommends FEMA
address staffing shortages, implement new training initiatives
to produce a more qualified workforce, and expand its
contracting workforce to improve the quality of recovery
efforts.\35\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\35\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
GAO asserted that FEMA's recovery programs are complex and
slow to provide post-disaster assistance.\36\ To improve
recovery programs for communities and survivors, GAO recommends
FEMA reconsider its Public Assistance (PA) reimbursement model,
which most often requires state, local, Tribal, and territorial
governments to provide upfront funding for recovery projects
and seek reimbursement at a later date. This reimbursement
model is a recovery barrier for communities that lack the
upfront funds.\37\ Stafford Sec. 428 authorizes FEMA to develop
alternative procedures for PA for state, local, Tribal,
territorial, or non-profit applicants and provide upfront
funding for recovery projects based on a fixed-cost
estimate.\38\ However, the GAO's testimony reported that
communities utilizing the alternative procedures authorized by
Stafford Sec. 428 find the process of developing fixed-cost
estimates to be difficult and lengthy.\39\

Emergency Management. (February 16, 2022). Hearing: FEMA Priorities for
2022: Stakeholder Perspectives. Testimony submitted by Chris Currie.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
GAO also recommended that FEMA consider equity across all
its programs by identifying potential disaster recovery access
barriers and disparate outcomes, prioritizing flood map
investments for vulnerable populations, and developing
specialized disaster assistance for older and disabled
individuals. To address equity challenges in FEMA's IA Program,
GAO recommends the agency simplify the Individual Housing
Program (IHP) application process and make it more accessible
to low-income and vulnerable populations.\40\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\40\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, to build resilience prior to disaster and reduce
the need for complex recovery efforts, GAO recommends that FEMA
update flood maps and flood risk products.\41\ To ensure all
small, rural, and underserved communities can access hazard
mitigation grant funds, GAO recommends that FEMA reduce the
complexity and length of hazard mitigation grant
applications.\42\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\41\ Id.
\42\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONCLUSION

FEMA has been tested in recent years by COVID-19 and by
disasters that are becoming more costly and frequent.\43\ The
FEMA Administrator leads the federal government's crisis
management agency during a time of overlapping management and
mission challenges. This hearing provides the subcommittee an
opportunity to hear directly from Administrator Criswell how
the administration will achieve the Strategic Plan goals and
meet these challenges.

FEMA PRIORITIES FOR 2022 AND THE
2022-2026 STRATEGIC PLAN

----------

TUESDAY, APRIL 5, 2022

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public
Buildings, and Emergency Management,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:05 a.m. in
room 2167 Rayburn House Office Building and via Zoom, Hon. Dina
Titus (Chair of the subcommittee) presiding.
Members present in person: Ms. Titus, Mr. DeFazio, Mr.
Webster of Florida, Mr. Massie, Mr. Larsen of Washington, and
Mr. Graves of Louisiana.
Members present remotely: Ms. Norton, Ms. Davids of Kansas,
Mrs. Napolitano, Ms. Van Duyne, and Mr. Stanton.
Ms. Titus. The subcommittee will come to order.
I ask unanimous consent that the chair be authorized to
declare a recess at any time during this hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that Members not on the
subcommittee be permitted to sit with the subcommittee at
today's hearing and ask questions.
Without objection, so ordered.
As a reminder, please keep your microphone muted unless
speaking. Should I hear any inadvertent background noise, I
will request that the Member please mute their microphone.
To insert a document into the record, please have your
staff email it to
[email protected]
.
I want to thank our Administrator, Ms. Criswell, for
joining us today to discuss FEMA's priorities for 2022, and the
Agency's 2022 through 2026 strategic plan.
Since you were last here in June of 2021, this subcommittee
has heard from several panels of witnesses that climate change,
severe related weather events, and development in high-risk
areas have changed the emergency management landscape. Today's
disasters cause more damage, have greater impacts on
communities, and require more time and money to recover.
These new challenges to the recovery process make it
imperative that FEMA cut the redtape within its assistance
programs and deliver resources to individuals and communities
in need in a timely fashion and in an equitable way.
I continue to hear from stakeholders and witnesses that
bureaucracy is adding inordinate complexity to the recovery
process. As FEMA processes a record number of project
worksheets and a multitude of Individual Assistance
applications, it must become a priority to identify commonsense
ways to simplify these pipelines.
Make no mistake, I am impressed by the work that the men
and women of FEMA have done to rise to the challenge time and
time again, especially over the past 5 years, as the workforce
has been stretched to its limits. Now is the time to provide
reinforcements so that FEMA can meet its present and future
mission.
Last month, I introduced bipartisan legislation designed to
ensure FEMA has the tools it needs to recruit and retain
qualified workers for its cadre of disaster reservists.
The GAO and the RAND Corporation have stated that providing
FEMA's workforce access to adequate protections, training, and
benefits will enhance the Agency's capabilities and create
better outcomes for disaster survivors and communities.
The unprecedented number of emergency and disaster
declarations and capacity challenges burdening FEMA today must
also inspire us to make proactive investments that will reduce
the impact of future disasters and protect our communities.
Mitigation is a proven way to save lives and property, and it
is cost effective. I strongly support expanding funding for
mitigation projects at the local and individual level.
I hope the House will take a positive step today by passing
the bipartisan Resilient AMERICA Act, which I was pleased to
support with Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and
subcommittee Ranking Member Webster. This legislation will
boost resources for predisaster mitigation, including
assistance for communities interested in updating their
building codes.
It will also establish a pilot block grant program so that
States interested in assisting residents in the wilderness-
urban interface can enhance defensible space around their
property or install fire-resistant building materials.
Mitigation cannot be effective unless it is fairly
distributed across all communities. I am concerned about
stakeholder feedback that FEMA's mitigation assistance programs
are only reaching the largest and best resourced communities.
The complexity of the hazard mitigation application process
makes it nearly impossible for small, disadvantaged, and rural
communities to successfully access these funds.
I appreciate your attention to a letter sent by this
subcommittee's leadership which posed a series of questions
regarding FEMA's efforts to streamline the hazard mitigation
grants process. And I hope that implementing reforms to make
this process more accessible will continue to be a shared
priority of the committee and the Agency so we move towards
more equitable recovery programs.
Administrator, I want to thank you for your work, what you
have done to guide FEMA in a positive direction by
acknowledging and addressing the impacts of climate change,
prioritizing equity, and investing in mitigation and
resilience. We look forward to your testimony and discussing
how this committee can work with you to make additional
progress in supporting disaster survivors in 2022 and beyond.
[Ms. Titus' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Dina Titus, a Representative in Congress
from the State of Nevada, and Chair, Subcommittee on Economic
Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management
I'd like to thank Administrator Criswell for joining us to discuss
the Federal Emergency Management Agency's priorities for 2022 and the
Agency's 2022-2026 Strategic Plan.
Since our last hearing together in June of 2021, this subcommittee

I continue to hear from stakeholders and witnesses that bureaucracy

Make no mistake, I am impressed by the work the women and men at
FEMA have done to rise to the challenge time and time again, especially
over the past five years as FEMA's workforce has been stretched to its
limits. Now is the time to provide reinforcements so that FEMA can meet
its present mission.
Last month I introduced bipartisan legislation designed to ensure
FEMA has the tools it needs to recruit and retain qualified workers for
its cadre of disaster reservists. The GAO and the RAND corporation have
stated that providing FEMA's workforce access to adequate protections,
training, and benefits will enhance the agency's capabilities and
create better outcomes for disaster survivors and communities.
The unprecedented number of emergency and disaster declarations and
capacity challenges burdening FEMA must also inspire us to make
proactive investments that will reduce the impact of future disasters
and protect our communities. Mitigation is a proven way to save lives
and property, and it's cost effective. I strongly support expanding
funding for mitigation projects at the local and individual level.
I hope the House will take a positive step today by passing the
bipartisan Resilient America Act, which I led with Chairman DeFazio,
Ranking Member Graves, and the Subcommittee's Ranking Member Mr.
Webster. This legislation will boost resources for pre-disaster
mitigation including: assistance for communities interested in updating
their building codes to reflect the latest hazard resistant designs,
and establishing a pilot block grant program so that states interested
in assisting residents in the wildland urban interface can enhance
defensible space around their property or install fire-resistant
building materials to reduce risks.
Mitigation cannot be effective unless it is fairly distributed
across all communities. I am concerned with stakeholder feedback that
FEMA's mitigation assistance programs are only reaching the largest and
best-resourced communities. The complexity of the hazard mitigation
application processes makes it nearly impossible for small,
disadvantaged, and rural communities to successfully access these
funds.
I appreciated your attention to a letter sent by this
subcommittee's leadership, which posed a series of questions regarding
FEMA's efforts to streamline the hazard mitigation grants process. I
hope that implementing reforms to make this process more accessible
will continue to be a shared priority for Congress and the agency.
Administrator, I thank you for the work you have done to guide FEMA
in a positive direction by acknowledging and addressing the impacts of
climate change, prioritizing equity, and investing in mitigation and
resilience. I look forward to your testimony and discussing how this
committee can work with you to make additional progress on supporting
disaster survivors in 2022 and beyond.

Ms. Titus. I would now like to welcome our--[discussion off
the record]--I would like to now welcome our ranking member,
Mr. Webster, for his opening comments.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you, Chair Titus. I want to
welcome and thank the Administrator for coming today.
FEMA has a mission critical to our Nation and my home
State, Florida. And you, Administrator Criswell, despite being
in the Department of Homeland Security, are the principal
advisor to the President when it comes to disasters. The
congressional review of the response to Hurricane Katrina
indicated how critical it is for the lead emergency manager,
not the Secretary of Homeland Security, to advise the
President. And that experience and knowledge is needed even
more today.
In recent years, we have seen the number and cost of
disasters increase--from hurricanes, flooding, ice storms,
tornadoes, other things, and wildfires. Ultimately, we all must
work towards solutions that will lower costs and save lives
through mitigation and preparation. But we also need to look at
how declared disasters can be closed out faster so FEMA, State,
and local resources can focus more quickly on preparing for the
next disaster.
The only sub to that is in regard to flooding. In our area,
the floods don't come for maybe a month or two afterwards, when
the crest builds. So, we should be fast, but not too fast.
Building in mitigation has been a bipartisan priority of
this committee. Studies have proven that every dollar spent,
invested upfront, can avoid $4 to $11 in disaster damages.
While the committee has passed legislation that supports this
goal, it does not help if the funding does not get out the door
in a timely manner. While I appreciate the importance of many
of the objectives in FEMA's strategic plan, in order to achieve
these goals, it is important for us to identify concrete steps
in streamlining FEMA's processes.
It seems every time we pass reforms intended to make the
process more accessible and faster, redtape creeps back in, or
applicants in one State are told something different than the
ones in another State. In February, we received testimony from
various stakeholders and the GAO detailing ongoing challenges
in FEMA programs. A common theme in much of the feedback
related to the cumbersome process, inconsistent decisions, and
confusing communications. Unfortunately, these have been
persistent issues. We need to work to find solutions, and
solutions that are sustainable, clear to applicants, and
consistently applied.
I look forward to hearing what you have to say about FEMA
priorities and the strategic plan, and how it can help improve
our Federal emergency management system.

Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you, and I yield back.
Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Webster. I now recognize the
chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Mr. DeFazio.
Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thanks for holding
this timely and important hearing, and thanks to Administrator
Criswell for taking the time to be with us today.
It's critical that we discuss FEMA's short-term and long-
term plans to meet challenges posed by an evolving disaster
landscape. Natural disasters have become more frequent, more
intense, and, of course, more damaging and costly. And they are
having a greater impact on communities across the Nation. And
it is critical that FEMA have the capacity to respond to this
growing challenge.
And to meet this goal, I believe FEMA needs an expanded
workforce. We are also working on how we can help with
reservists who get called up. And we have to be able to be
certain that your programs are implemented as effectively,
efficiently, equitably, with as little redtape as possible, but
protecting against the potential for fraud and abuse.
My State, my home State, Oregon, we've got great natural
beauty, but we also have a great risk of natural disasters.
Flooding, wildfires, the potential for a massive, once-in-350-
to-500-year earthquake at 9 on the Richter scale, which would
bring tsunamis. And then, of course, we had the unprecedented
extreme heat events last summer, which caused mortality in
Portland, the second least air-conditioned city in the country,
because we never needed it before, and Seattle. We had
temperatures that were so far above the norm, it couldn't have
happened--there is a consensus of scientists--without the
impacts of climate change, and it will happen more frequently.
So, new challenges for FEMA and things that we need to
prepare for, as the Chair mentioned, with mitigation in
advance.
You have been stretched. And I think the whole committee
recognizes this. Your workers have done incredible things with,
in my opinion, inadequate resources. And, we want to hear more
about your 2022-2026 strategic plan, and how you intend to
expand your capacity and be able to deal with these disasters
as they happen.
I think you have been doing a great job at an Agency which
did fall into a little bit of neglect during the last
administration. You have taken us through the pandemic, a whole
different and new challenge. Hurricane Ida, Kentucky tornadoes,
while you are reforming programs at the same time, which is
long overdue.
I am pleased you have made equity a priority.
And the Agency continues to seek innovative ways to
restructure its programs, in particular the issue of
documentation. I first ran across this as a very significant
issue in Puerto Rico, when I was on a congressional trip down
there after the disastrous hurricane, where the courthouses
were wiped out. People had no way of providing the
documentation that was initially being demanded, and they were
all routinely being denied. And we have taken some steps to
mitigate that, but we need to do better.
We had a similar instance in southern Oregon with a
devastating wildfire which wiped out a number of trailer parks,
similar issues regarding lack of documentation because their
house trailer was parked in an a trailer park. We have to be
able to deal with these things. Again, we always have to be
wary and afraid of the potential for fraud and abuse, but we
don't have to get to the point where we are disqualifying
people who should be and are eligible and have gotten lost in
the bureaucratic quagmire being initially denied, not knowing
how to re-apply, or what other documentation they might be able
to provide. And I think you have made some strides there, but I
think more needs to be done.
As the Chair mentioned, resilience and mitigation are
absolutely key. I mean, the cost-benefit ratio is
extraordinary. And some of these programs--in particular,
mitigation--are not tremendously accessible to small, rural,
and disadvantaged communities who lack the expertise of a
sophisticated management staff. We need to be able to figure
out ways to help them better, apply and understand what they
could be eligible for in the wake of disasters or a
predisaster, in terms of mitigation and planning.
There is $1.7 billion that could yet be committed for
predisaster mitigation from the COVID-19 declarations alone,
and I am hopeful that we will find ways to usefully invest
those funds.
Thanks again for being with us today. Thanks again for your
work at the Agency, your expertise, and I look forward to your
remarks.
[Mr. DeFazio's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Peter A. DeFazio, a Representative in
Congress from the State of Oregon, and Chair, Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure
Thank you, Chair Titus, and thank you to Administrator Criswell for
taking the time to be with us today.
There is no better time than now to discuss FEMA's short-term and
long-term plans to meet the challenges posed by an evolving disaster
landscape. Natural disasters have become more costly and are having
greater impact upon communities across the nation. It is critical that
FEMA is equipped with the capacity to respond. To meet this goal, I
believe FEMA must expand its workforce and ensure its programs are
implemented as effectively, efficiently, and equitably as possible.
This mission is critical since the quality of FEMA's programs
significantly impact disaster survivors' recovery.
Oregon is home to a lot of natural beauty, and unfortunately, this
beauty also comes at the price of great risk of natural disasters. My
constituents are vulnerable to hazards including flooding, wildfires,
earthquakes, tsunamis, and extreme heat just to name a few, and climate
change is causing these disasters to impact the state in unprecedented
ways. In 2020, wildfires damaged more than 5,000 structures and forced
tens of thousands of Oregonians to evacuate. In 2021, record breaking
heatwaves in Oregon posed a major health risk to my constituents and
tragically caused over 90 deaths.
Unprecedented hazard events have not been confined to Oregon. The
record-breaking cost of the 2017 and 2018 disaster seasons and the
nationwide COVID-19 disaster declarations have stretched FEMA to its
limit. FEMA's 2022-2026 Strategic Plan acknowledges this challenge and
I look forward to discussing how FEMA intends to expand capacity and
adapt its programs to ensure disaster survivors receive the quality
assistance they deserve.
I am proud of the work FEMA has achieved under your leadership. You
have guided the agency though a pandemic, responded to complex
disasters such as Hurricane Ida and the Kentucky tornadoes, while
simultaneously implementing reforms that make FEMA's programs more
equitable. It is refreshing that this Administration has made equity a
priority and that the Agency continues to seek innovative ways to
restructure its programs.
I was especially pleased that the agency will now accept additional
forms of documentation to verify the occupancy and ownership
requirements of disaster survivors seeking Individual Assistance. This
policy change has made Individual Assistance more accessible to
underserved communities and homeowners that may not have access to a
deed or formal proof of home ownership. However, there is still a lot
of work remaining to fully incorporate equity into FEMA's programs. I
fully support these efforts and am open to considering statutory
changes.
Reforming FEMA's response and recovery programs is not enough.
Expanding mitigation and resilience efforts must be at the forefront of
any conversation regarding the increasing frequency, intensity, and
cost of natural disasters. Time and again it has been proven that
mitigation is a commonsense, cost-effective way to save lives and
property. That's why I strongly support finding ways to increase
funding for mitigation and resilience projects.
I echo Chair Titus' remarks that FEMA's mitigation programs must
become more accessible to small, rural, and disadvantaged communities.
I would also like to see FEMA use its full authorities to place money
in the pre-disaster mitigation fund. At present, there's another $1.7
billion in authority that can be committed to pre-disaster mitigation
from the COVID-19 declarations alone.
Thank you again for your time, testimony, and expertise. I look
forward to continuing our work together to drive needed reforms inside
FEMA and will work to ensure you have the authorities, resources, and
direction to achieve your goals and the agency's mission.
Thank you. I yield back.

Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would now like to
welcome our witness today, the Honorable Deanne Criswell, who
is the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
Thank you for coming and sharing with us your plans for
FEMA. We all look forward to hearing from you.
Without objection, our witness' full statement will be
included in the record.
Administrator Criswell, you have the floor.

TESTIMONY OF HON. DEANNE CRISWELL, ADMINISTRATOR, FEDERAL
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY

Ms. Criswell. Thank you very much. Good morning, Chair
Titus, Ranking Member Webster, and members of the subcommittee.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today.
The field of emergency management is at a pivotal moment.
We are seeing tremendous change in the landscape of risk and in
our professional roles.
While our mission has not changed, our operating
environment has: 10 years ago, we managed an average of 108
disasters a year; today, we are managing 311. That includes the
ongoing response to COVID-19.
The changing climate is the biggest crisis that is facing
our Nation. It is making natural disasters more frequent, more
intense, and more destructive. And this pattern will continue
for the foreseeable future. And at the same time, structural
inequities in our society are compounding the impacts of
disasters for our historically underserved communities. The
2022-2026 FEMA strategic plan identifies three ambitious goals
that we must achieve to address these challenges.
First, we must instill equity as a foundation of emergency
management. It is important to recognize disasters affect
individuals and communities differently. We must commit
ourselves to reducing barriers to access and commit to
developing equitable outcomes for all survivors. We must put
people first and reduce the burdens to individuals and
communities by making our programs simpler, more accessible,
and more user friendly.
We have already made important changes to the way we
provide assistance to make this true. For instance, some
homeowners had difficulty proving they owned their homes if
their property had been handed down informally through the
years. We expanded the types of ownership documentation that we
can accept, like receipts for major repairs or improvements,
court documents, public officials' letters, mobile park
letters, and even self-certification for mobile homes and
travel trailers as a last resort.
In addition, FEMA has changed the way we calculate the
threshold for property loss to qualify for our direct housing
program, such as a trailer or a mobile home. The change
resulted in more than 1,400 families receiving assistance who
would not have been considered for direct housing in the past.
That means 1,400 families with a roof over their head, a bed to
sleep in, and a stove to cook with.
These are just a few examples of where our ``people first''
approach has made a difference, but we can and will do more.
We also know that the more our workforce resembles the
Nation we serve, the better we will be at serving our Nation.
This is why our strategic plan focuses our recruiting efforts
to reach individuals from underrepresented communities,
including through partnering with organizations like
Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other
minority-serving institutions. Our goal is to create hiring
pipelines from these institutions into the field of emergency
management, opening new opportunities for underrepresented
communities who may not see themselves reflected in today's
workforce.
As you know, FEMA is not just a response and recovery
Agency. One of my highest priorities is to focus equally on
what we can do on the front end before a disaster. This is why
our second strategic goal is to lead the whole of community in
climate resilience.
We must recognize that we are facing a climate crisis. FEMA
can educate not only our own staff, but also the Nation, about
the impacts of our changing climate. We must integrate future
conditions into our planning efforts. We must think bigger
about how we approach mitigation and shift our projects to
those with communitywide impact. And, as with disaster relief,
we must eliminate barriers to underserved communities, the
barriers they face to receive mitigation assistance.
I would like to thank Congress for passing the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This legislation
provides significant funding to establish revolving loan funds
under the STORM Act, as well as for FEMA's other hazard
mitigation assistance grant programs. These investments will
only grow in importance as climate change continues to alter
the landscape of risk facing emergency managers across our
country.
I am also committed to making sure FEMA's workforce is well
equipped to advise our partners on the best ways to build
climate-resilient communities. I am directing a new
collaborative steering group comprised of FEMA leadership to
begin a multiyear initiative to incorporate the dynamics of a
changing climate into relevant training, planning, grant
eligibility, and exercises as appropriate. FEMA program offices
and the U.S. Fire Administration will also collaborate to
strengthen the capability of emergency management partners to
advance these critical issues within their pre- and post-
disaster work.
Our third strategic goal is to promote and sustain a ready
FEMA and a prepared Nation. The increase in frequency,
severity, and complexity of disasters has heightened demands on
FEMA's workforce and on the first responder workforces across
our Nation. To rise to this challenge, FEMA must expand its
approach to Agency readiness and to national preparedness. We
need a better understanding of the value and skill set
emergency managers bring to bear.
We also need to standardize emergency management career
paths, and FEMA's educational institutions are going to lead
that effort, making training available to emergency managers
anywhere they are at any time in their careers.
And FEMA is improving its ability to meet the increasingly
complex missions beyond the typical Stafford Act emergencies
and disasters. I want to thank Congress for including funding
in the recent omnibus for a non-Stafford Incident Management
Assistance Team.
We are also bolstering the support staff who enable our
Stafford Act disaster workforce to better meet the challenges
of the year-long operational tempo. This includes procurement
specialists who allow us to actually mobilize assistance,
computer specialists who facilitate data and information
sharing, those who ensure civil rights are protected in all
activities, and the personnel necessary to train the workforce,
manage operations, and focus on employee wellness.
Since I last appeared before this subcommittee in June of
last year, FEMA has been tested on many fronts, and our people
have risen to the occasion. As we look ahead, the FEMA
strategic plan is ambitious, but it is equal to the challenges
we face.
Thank you very much for this opportunity to testify today.
[Ms. Criswell's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Deanne Criswell, Administrator, Federal
Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Chair Titus, Ranking Member Webster, and Members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the
2022-2026 FEMA Strategic Plan, and our ongoing efforts to fundamentally
reshape and strengthen FEMA's abilities to help people before, during,
and after disasters.
The field of emergency management is at a pivotal moment. We are
seeing tremendous change in the landscape of risk and in our
professional roles. While our mission has not changed, our operating
environment has. Ten years ago, we managed an average of 108 disasters
a year. Today, we are managing 311--including the ongoing response to
the COVID-19 pandemic. The most recent report from the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is very clear that physical
changes in our climate--heat, cold, rain, drought, snow, wind, coastal
flooding, and more--are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of
years.
The changing climate is the biggest crisis facing our nation. It is
making natural disasters more frequent, more intense, and more
destructive, and this pattern will continue for the foreseeable future.
At the same time, structural inequities in our society are compounding
the impacts of disasters for historically underserved communities. Left
unaddressed, these twin challenges pose unacceptable risks to the
nation.
The 2022-2026 FEMA Strategic Plan identifies three ambitious goals
we must achieve to address these challenges.
First, we must instill equity as a foundation of emergency
management. It is important we recognize disasters affect individuals
and communities differently. We must commit ourselves to reducing
barriers to access and commit to delivering equitable outcomes for all
survivors. Disaster survivors have already experienced their worst day,
and we must ensure our policies and programs meet them where they are
and provide support and nothing less. Systems which create barriers and
result in inequitable outcomes serve no one, especially in times of
crisis. We must put people first and reduce the burdens to individuals
and communities by making our programs simpler, more accessible, and
more user-friendly.
We have already made important changes to the way we provide
assistance to make this true. For instance, some homeowners had
difficulty proving they owned their homes if their property had been
handed down informally through the years. We took action by expanding
the types of ownership documentation we can accept, including documents
like receipts for major repairs or improvements, court documents,
public officials' letters, mobile home park letters, and even applicant
self-certification for mobile homes and travel trailers as a last
resort. In addition, FEMA has changed the way we calculate the
threshold for property losses to qualify for our Direct Housing program
(such as a trailer or mobile home). Our goal--ensure equitable damage
evaluations regardless of the amount of damage to the home. Changing
the calculation of the threshold from a fixed dollar floor of $17,000
to a simpler $12 per square foot, resulted in more than 1,400 families
receiving assistance who would not have been considered for direct
housing in the past. That means 1,400 families with a roof over their
head, beds to sleep in, and a stove to cook with. This change
especially made a difference for survivors with lower value homes.
These are a few examples of where our people first approach has made a
difference. But we can do more. We will do more.
We also know, the more our workforce resembles the nation we serve,
the better we will be at serving our nation. Which is why our Strategic
Plan focuses our recruiting efforts to reach individuals from
underrepresented communities, including through partnering with
organizations like Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)
and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium of Tribal Colleges
and Universities and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). Our
goal is to create hiring pipelines from these institutions into the
field of emergency management, opening new opportunities for
underrepresented communities who may not see themselves reflected in
today's workforce, and as a result, may have been dissuaded from
joining the emergency management profession.
As you know, FEMA is not just a response and recovery agency. One
of my highest priorities is to focus equally on what we can do on the
front end, before a disaster--as this is often as important, if not
more important than what we do when a disaster strikes.
Which is why our second strategic goal is to lead whole of
community in climate resilience. We must recognize we are facing a
climate crisis. FEMA can educate not only our own staff, but also the
nation about the impacts our changing climate poses, and how this will
influence the work we do as emergency managers. We must integrate
future conditions into our planning efforts. We must think bigger about
how we approach mitigation and shift our projects to those with
community-wide impact, and, as with disaster relief, we must eliminate
barriers underserved communities face to receive mitigation assistance.
I would like to thank Congress for working with the Biden-Harris
Administration to provide FEMA with additional resources to reduce the
impact of climate change by passing the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act. This legislation provides significant funding to establish
revolving loan funds under the STORM Act, as well as for FEMA's other
Hazard Mitigation Assistance grant programs. These investments will
only grow in importance as climate change continues to alter the
landscape of risk facing emergency managers across the country. Which
is why we've made resources available, such as new Direct Technical
Assistance, for local communities to provide support for both project
and application-specific needs, as well as community-wide resilience
needs.
I am also committed to making sure FEMA's workforce is well-
equipped to advise our partners on the best ways to build climate
resilient communities. I am directing a new collaborative steering
group comprised of leadership from FEMA's program offices to begin a
multi-year initiative to incorporate the dynamics of a changing climate
into relevant training, planning, grant eligibility, and exercises, as
appropriate. FEMA program offices and the U.S. Fire Administration will
also collaborate to strengthen the capability of state, local,
territorial, and tribal nation partners to advance these critical
issues within their pre- and post-disaster work. I believe a more
climate literate workforce which considers the impacts of future risks
in disaster planning and understands how the natural world, in
conjunction with our current systems, can help or burden survivors,
will position FEMA to truly lead the way on hazard mitigation and
resilience.
Our third strategic goal is to promote and sustain a ready FEMA and
prepared nation. The increase in frequency, severity, and complexity of
disasters has heightened demands on FEMA's workforce and on the first
responder workforces in every state, tribal nation, county, and city in
the nation which comprise the broader emergency management community.
To rise to this challenge, FEMA must expand its approach to agency
readiness and to national preparedness. We will accomplish this in the
following ways. First, we need a better understanding of the value and
skill set emergency managers bring to bear, in other words, a clear
standard definition of the competencies, required to become a qualified
emergency manager.
Second, like other professions, emergency management must
standardize its career paths, and FEMA's educational institutions will
lead the effort to advance the emergency management profession by
supporting curricula for comprehensive emergency management training,
education, and professional development for our partners across the
nation by making training available to emergency managers anywhere they
are, at any time in their careers. We are modernizing their operational
design so the nation's federal, state, local, territorial, tribal
nation, non-governmental organization, and private sector emergency
managers can meet the risks posed by increasing hazards, and obtain the
training required to become certified within the National Qualification
System.
Third, FEMA is improving our ability to meet the increasing number
of current and emergent threats requiring federal support. As FEMA is
uniquely positioned to provide incident management and coordination
support for increasingly complex missions beyond typical Stafford Act
emergencies and disasters, we are envisioning, planning, and preparing
for incidents which do not fall into common disaster categories. I want
to thank Congress for including funding in the recent Omnibus for a
non-Stafford Incident Management Assistance Team (IMAT). Having this
capability will help us more rapidly and effectively provide incident
management support for these emerging threats.
We are also in the process of looking at the architecture of our
Stafford Act disaster workforce to better meet the challenges of the
yearlong operational tempo which is our new reality. As FEMA's incident
management and incident support workforce continues to grow, we are
prioritizing the growth of the support workforce which enables them,
such as the procurement specialists needed to execute the contracts and
mission assignments, which allows us to actually mobilize assistance;
the computer specialist who facilitate data and information sharing
within FEMA's IT infrastructure; those who ensure civil rights are
protected in all activities; and the personnel necessary to train the
workforce, manage operations, and the experts who focus on employee
wellness.
The last group is so critical. Dealing with an unrelenting pace of
a year-round cycle of disasters and crisis takes its toll on the FEMA
team. To be ready for the next disaster, whenever it comes, we must
look out for the physical, emotional and mental health of our people.
We are looking at our existing flexibilities to ensure that our people
can rest and reset, and take care of themselves and their families. We
cannot do what we do without our people. Since I last appeared before
this Subcommittee in June of last year, FEMA has been tested on many
fronts, and our people have risen to the occasion. Their adaptability,
dedication, and willingness to do the hard work is unquestionable and
unbelievable.
In closing, the 2022-2026 FEMA Strategic Plan is ambitious, but it
is equal to the challenges we face. I look forward to all we will
accomplish together as we continue to build a more ready and resilient
nation. Thank you for the opportunity to testify, and I look forward to
your questions.

Ms. Titus. Thank you very much for being here,
Administrator.
We will now move on to Member questions. Each Member will
be recognized for 5 minutes, and I will start by recognizing
Chairman DeFazio.
Mr. DeFazio. Thanks, Madam Chair.
Madam Administrator, I am noting that we haven't made a lot
of progress on implementing a national set of reasonable and
prudent alternatives to get the National Flood Insurance
Program into compliance with the Endangered Species Act. This
is particularly problematic because of litigation filed and
settled under the Obama administration.
Washington State has one set of standards, and then, with
further litigation, Oregon is expected to adopt a much more
extreme and unique set of standards. And there is also
potential for litigation in Florida and elsewhere, ending up
with a nationwide patchwork disqualifying people from access to
Federal flood insurance in ways that are not reasonable. We
need a Federal standard.
Just quickly, an example, when I looked at the potential
impacts of the so-called settlement for Oregon, I held a press
conference in front of the Coos Bay World newspaper, which is
about 8 blocks from the 101 Highway, which then, on the other
side is Coos Bay, and that is considered critical salmon
habitat. And any redevelopment of that area would be prohibited
from having Federal flood insurance. What kind of progress are
we making on this? What kind of timeline do you have to get
this in place, to have a nationwide standard for the whole
country?
Ms. Criswell. Chair DeFazio, thank you for raising this
very important issue. I know that this is incredibly important
to you in Oregon, but especially as we look at the way we are
going to implement projects across the country. And there are a
lot of unique challenges that you are specifically experiencing
in Oregon.
I know that my team has been continuing to work on this
issue. I believe that they have briefed your staff recently on
some of the progress that has been made. But I am happy to
follow up with my team and to meet with your staff to see
exactly where we are at in this process.
Mr. DeFazio. Yes, because many of our cities and counties
are about to go through a very expensive process to revise
their mandated State land-use plans in order to be in
compliance. Once they begin that process, I mean, they are
going to be spending money and resources they could better use
elsewhere if suddenly we are going to be looking at a new
national standard, versus the unique standard that has been
established for Oregon. So, I would appreciate that.
Ms. Criswell. Yes, sir.
Mr. DeFazio. And then the other question is--and this may
be something that the committee needs to address in conjunction
with you--the current post-disaster assistance model requires
survivors to file applications with multiple agencies. And
then, if you have filed over here and you get assistance there,
and then you file over here you are disqualified. And then
sometimes over here they want the money back. And over here you
could have--it gets incredibly complicated. And I know it
involves SBA and HUD.
Are we looking at memorandums of understanding, or any way
to streamline this in the future?
Ms. Criswell. Yes, absolutely, sir. The work that we do in
coordination with SBA and HUD is incredibly important to help
survivors, especially as they are beginning to go through the
process and try to get back on their feet. I know that it is
frustrating for them to have to put information into several
different applications.
What we have been doing here recently is--and I think we
are getting closer to this goal--is that we have been working
on ways to share our data better across the platforms. So, the
information that they put in with one application, say with
FEMA, then would transfer automatically over to SBA or HUD.
I think the data-sharing piece is one of our biggest
challenges that we are facing right now, and rightly so, with
all the privacy concerns that are out there. And we are making
steps to get closer on that. And it is--certainly happy to
provide any followup information on the specifics of where we
are.
Mr. DeFazio. OK. And if the committee needs to be helpful
with those other committees of jurisdiction here, I am certain
that the chair would be willing to hear from the Agency on any
assistance you need, as would I, and I am sure would other
members of the committee.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Ms. Titus. Thank you. Yes. As a matter of fact, I have been
talking to some people from the industry who would like to put
together a roundtable, which would be a more informal way for
them to have input, for you to address some of these issues,
and for the committee to be there in less structured, kind of
5-minute intervals. So, we are working on setting that up. So,
we will certainly keep you posted.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We will now recognize Mr. Webster
for 5 minutes.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you, Chair.
Administrator Criswell, the GAO has highlighted that the
significant percentage of FEMA workforce deployed is not
properly trained. Well, the people who work for FEMA joined
FEMA to help other people. And if they don't know how, it is
going to be pretty hard to carry out their duties. Can you give
just some examples or steps you are taking to make sure that
the FEMA workforce is properly trained?
Ms. Criswell. Yes, absolutely, Ranking Member. The GAO
report came out with three recommendations, and we concurred
with all three of those recommendations.
The workforce, again, it was one of my priorities as I was
going through the confirmation process, and it has been
embedded into our strategic plan going forward. The women and
the men that work here at FEMA, they are some of the best in
the business. And you are right, they are passionate about what
they do, because they do get to help people before, during, and
after disasters.
And we have taken steps in regards to the three
recommendations. In fact, I think we closed out the first two,
or I have asked to close out the first two recommendations in
that GAO report.
Specifically to the one regarding the training, we have
implemented new ways to encourage our reservist workforce to
accomplish the training during their off-duty hours, in
addition to the times when they are deployed. And we have also
implemented a new reservist--let me look up here--the reservist
performance management directive, so we can help track the
level of training and the level of performance that our
reservists are accomplishing on their disasters to better
identify any gaps and areas that we still need to improve, and
things that we may need to put in place to continue to help our
employees get the level of training that they need to perform
their jobs.
Mr. Webster of Florida. So, do you have also trouble
finding people to join up with the workforce?
Ms. Criswell. Recruitment and retention is one of the
things that--again, one of our biggest priorities. I think our
focus right now, sir, is focusing on recruiting a diverse
workforce, as I mentioned in my opening statement, reaching out
to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other
institutions to help build that workforce.
I think, as we go through--and I would like to thank
Congress, specifically Chair Titus and Congressman Katko, for
introducing legislation that mirrors what the Senate has put
forth that would give FEMA reservist USERRA protections. I
think having that type of protection going forward is going to
be transformational in how we can recruit our workforce, and
really build the level of expertise to meet the growing
challenges.
Mr. Webster of Florida. So, consistency and coordination
across Federal disaster assistance programs has been an ongoing
issue. Some stakeholders have proposed a universal application
for all disaster programs. What are your thoughts on that kind
of solution, so that if you ask one State and another State it
would be the same advice, same procedure, same stepping stone?
Ms. Criswell. Yes, again, sir, I think absolutely. If we
can find ways to help create more of a single type of
application, it is only going to make it easier for individuals
to access the assistance that is available to them during
disasters.
Again, I think we are making some progress in that stance.
Right now, working on our ability to share data, I think, is
going to be the biggest step forward. So, at least, if they are
entering information in one platform, it gets transferred
automatically over into another platform.
But we are going to continue to push on how we can bring
the different application processes together to make it simpler
and easier on the individuals that are applying for assistance.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Does it go across also--like, does
it bridge different kinds of disasters? Like, there are
hurricanes, there are also floods, there are also wildfires. Is
there some commonality there also?
Ms. Criswell. I think, if I am understanding your question
correctly, if an individual experiences a type of disaster--and
we are talking about individuals--then as they go into FEMA's
system to apply for assistance, it doesn't depend. It doesn't
matter what type of disaster they are trying to recover from.
The same information is out there. And then again, working with
HUD and SBA to try to share that data better so they can more
easily transition through their recovery programs, as well.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you so much. I yield back,
Chair.
Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Webster.
I so appreciate you, Administrator, for mentioning our
bill, Mr. Katko's and my bill about creating this reserve
force. We are really pushing hard to get that through, and I
think it will make a difference.
I will follow up on a question by the chairman about the
patchwork for floods. There are 10 different regions, and we
always hear that there is inconsistency in the decisionmaking
from one region to another. It is not just about flood
insurance. I wonder if you are planning to have some strict
guidance so people who are working in one area on these issues
will know the expectations, and they will be the same as those
working on another. And that also helps with the equity issue
that we think is so important.
Can you discuss how you are moving towards perhaps greater
consistency within the Agency?
Ms. Criswell. Absolutely, Chair Titus. I think I have heard
that same thing. I have been to many different States during
disaster response this last year, but also to follow up on some
of the recovery operations that are happening around the
country from previous years. And I have heard the same thing
many times about needing consistency in how we do things.
I think it needs to be a balance. Where I am focused, I
think consistency is incredibly important. But I also don't
want to lose the flexibility to be able to recognize that every
State, every jurisdiction is going to experience disasters
differently. And we want to be able to deliver our services
equitably and without being restricted to a one-size-fits-all
approach. And so, as we work to try to find that balance, I am
going to keep both of those in the front of my mind as
priorities of making sure we are interpreting policy
consistently, but also having enough room for flexibility that
we recognize every community experiences a disaster differently
and has different needs.
Ms. Titus. Well, I appreciate that. We know Las Vegas is
not like any other place, so we want to keep some flexibility.
But having that consistency, I think, is important.
Going back to the equity question, we often see that people
who have fewer resources, it is harder for them to apply or
know where to go or how to get the assistance. Same thing for
communities. Some small communities don't have a planner. They
don't have the money to put into a grant writer, so they are
less likely to get assistance. Can you talk about how you want
to make that a more just and equitable system when you have
those differences in resources?
Ms. Criswell. Yes, I can talk about that, Chair Titus, on
two respects, right?
So, first, on the individual side, we did make a lot of
changes to our internal policies last year going into hurricane
season to better allow individuals that are having trouble
navigating our system to be more eligible for assistance. And
so, we made changes to, again, the way we accept documentation,
which resulted in 42,000 homeowners being eligible for disaster
assistance from us that we would have previously denied in the
past.
I think making these simple policy changes that we did last
year has made a tremendous difference. And we are looking at
any other long-term legislative or regulatory changes that we
may also need to do going forward to continue to build on that
equity within the delivery of our Individual Assistance
programs.
On the second part of your question, when we talk about
delivery of our grants and our other programs to communities,
specifically I think about our BRIC program, the Building
Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program. I think I
heard in some of the opening comments about the difficulty in
communities to apply for even our grants because of the
requirements and the bureaucracy that come with that.
And so, what we did was, we are offering with that program
directed technical assistance that is really designed to reach
out to these smaller, more rural communities that don't
necessarily have the capacity. Now, if a jurisdiction can hire
a consultant to apply, then they don't need our technical
assistance. It is those communities that we know need our
assistance the most, but have the hardest time applying for our
assistance.
The first year, we only had 12 jurisdictions ask us for
this direct technical assistance, but we did a lot of outreach
last year to try to encourage more jurisdictions that we knew
needed help that had repeated disasters apply. We had over 70
communities apply for this assistance going into this round of
grants, which just really shows your point, that we have
communities that need this type of help, but they don't have
necessarily the capacity to navigate our grant process.
We are going to continue to work on that and how we can
better use the data we have to identify the communities that
need our help the most, and figure out ways to help them get to
that information or that resource.
Ms. Titus. Well, that is good news. If there is any way we
can help you do that, please let us know.
Just real briefly on the BRIC program, as I understand it,
the wildfire suppression is not covered by the BRIC program. It
is not eligible. Is there something we need to do to help you
have that authority, or do you already have it? Because this is
such a serious problem in the West.
Ms. Criswell. If I am understanding your question
correctly, so, wildfire suppression would be a response
activity. And we have programs through our Fire Management
Assistance Grant that can help reimburse communities for some
of their response activities.
When we talk about BRIC, it is for mitigation, and it is
eligible, fire mitigation is an eligible program under BRIC.
But there are some distinctions between whether that is
mitigation on State and local lands versus Federal lands. And
it would not be eligible for Federal lands, only for State and
local lands.
Ms. Titus. OK, I think we need to look at that. Well, thank
you very much.
I think we have now Mr. Graves.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Administrator, thank you for being here today, for joining
us. And I want to thank you for coming down to Louisiana in the
aftermath of Hurricane Ida. We spent some time together in St.
John Parish, and I really appreciate you doing that.
And I also want to tell you that I appreciate the comments
you made a little while ago about lowering--what did you say,
eliminating barriers to access for assistance. I think it is
critically important, and it is something that needs to be
addressed.
I have got some concerns that I want to discuss with you,
though, related to Risk Rating 2.0. So, I listened to you talk
about underserved communities, marginalized communities. And
under Risk Rating 2.0, that--I want to make note, these massive
changes did not go through Congress. They did not explicitly go
through Congress. This dates back to the Obama administration
who shelved it, the Trump administration shelved it, and now
the Biden administration has chosen to move forward.
One example, we had a house in Larose, Louisiana, preferred
risk, $572 a year was their rate. There was a clarification
because they were going to make their policy effective
September 30th. They actually had to move it to making it
effective October 8th, roughly a week later. And the rate went
from $572 to $5,531. We have got other examples where folks
have gone from $560 preferred risk policy to $7,000, $8,000 and
$9,000 a year.
I am having a lot of trouble understanding how you can be
talking about equity and addressing marginalized or underserved
communities whenever FEMA is thrusting--administratively--is
thrusting these types of actions on our constituents. Could you
please respond?
Ms. Criswell. Absolutely, Congressman Graves. So, Risk
Rating 2.0 really is about equity. And in our previous version
of our NFIP program, every homeowner had the same level of
premium and the same level of increase, regardless of what
their risk was to their property.
What Risk Rating 2.0 does, for me, is a couple of things.
From the equity side, Risk Rating 2.0 now takes into account
your unique, specific risk. And so, you are only paying for the
risk that your property has. And so, it is specific to that.
And individuals that have homes that are in lower risk areas
are not subsidizing homes that are in higher risk areas.
But I think what is more important about Risk Rating 2.0 is
that now homeowners truly understand what their risk is, which
means that they have a better idea of how they can plan to
protect their family. Now they know that they are actually at a
higher risk, or in a higher risk area, and can take appropriate
measures to prepare for that.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Madam Administrator, I want to be
really clear. I totally agree with you in conveying risk to
property owners, but let's go through a few things.
Number one, when these folks built their property, in most
cases they built it at the FEMA base flood elevation. They
complied with FEMA standards. This isn't a car or table that
you just move. This is a house. You can't move a house. Or, as
you are aware, using ICC funds limited to $30,000, it is not
near enough to actually elevate homes.
Number two, you are talking about charging people for risk.
In my home State of Louisiana, we have lost 2,000 square miles
of our coast, 2,000. That is like the State of Rhode Island
being wiped off the map. That is not because of the actions of
our constituents. It is largely the responsibility or actions
of the Federal Government that have done that.
Similarly, we are draining parts of Canada, New York,
Montana, and others. One of the largest watersheds in the
world, they are sending us more water--again, not things we can
control, yet you are charging our constituents for it.
First Street Foundation did an analysis looking at the
rates under Risk Rating 2.0. They found in their analysis that
the State of Louisiana was the only State that was actually
overcharged, that Risk Rating 2.0 overcharges Louisiana. We
asked your front office for an explanation of that. We asked
for it before our April 1st meeting, and they failed to provide
us a response. I want to ask if you could please get us that
information.
Lastly, Administrator, look, I know you have got a heck of
a job, and I heard you rattling off statistics about the number
of disasters. This whole thing about coming in and trying to
address inequities, look, the Wall Street Journal yesterday,
President Xi of China, he has abandoned their common prosperity
initiative because he is concerned about the actual impacts.
We have got to make sure we are moving forward on a merit-
based approach, those that have the greatest impacts are being
addressed. And I am very concerned about the lack of
transparency in terms of how this is going to be done, if it is
going to distort impacts or distort winners and losers here. I
would ask for clarity on how that is going to be administered
by FEMA, moving forward.
I yield back.
Ms. Titus. Thank you. I now recognize Ms. Norton.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, Madam Chair, for this important
hearing.
Administrator Criswell, FEMA lists its goals, strategic
plan, for the next 4 years. And on that plan is to create a
workforce that reflects the Nation's diversity. Could you
please elaborate on FEMA's plan to partner with Historically
Black Colleges and Universities and other minority-serving
institutions to establish a hiring pipeline in the field of
emergency management?
I am a Member representing a district with two HBCUs, so I
appreciate this effort, and would be interested in sharing the
details with my constituents.
Ms. Criswell. Absolutely, ma'am. Yes, I think one of the
most important things that we can do is build a workforce that
is representative of the communities that we serve.
I have seen, just by having conversation with our employees
as we were developing our strategic plan, as well as we have
been revising some of our programs to include even our
preparedness messaging, the importance of having individuals
here within our workforce be able to speak on behalf of the
different cultures across our country. So, our primary goal is
to make sure that we are building that workforce that
represents those communities.
We have started an initiative to reach out to Historically
Black Colleges and Universities and other minority institutions
to try to build that workforce. We have done a great job in the
last year of creating a better, diverse workforce as it regards
to gender over the last year. Much of my leadership team are
now women, which is exciting.
But we do have some work to go in building a culturally
diverse workforce, and initiatives like reaching out to the
HBCUs is one of our first steps to try to achieve that goal.
Ms. Norton. When disasters strike close to home, it is the
local communities that are impacted and are most ready to
serve. What efforts have been made to recruit and train a
diverse workforce pulled straight from local communities?
Ms. Criswell. I think that is a fantastic point, because
many of the employees that I have talked to came to FEMA
because they were a disaster survivor. And so, what we have is,
when we do have an incident, an event that happens, we have an
aggressive local hire program that we set targets for hiring
people from within the communities.
I think it does a couple of things, right? It, one, brings
people into our workforce that know their communities best, but
it also helps us build a workforce of the future that then
knows what it is like to be that disaster survivor and can help
us continue to change and evolve our programs to meet their
needs.
And so, our local hire program has been one of our best
tools to increase the number of employees we have that are
supporting the actual communities that have been impacted.
Ms. Norton. Well, I will be looking very closely at that
local hiring here, in the District of Columbia.
The New York Times, in June 2021, reported that White
disaster victims received more from FEMA than people of color,
even when the amount of damage to their homes and properties is
the same. Could you explain why this occurred?
Ms. Criswell. Yes, I have read that report, and I have read
other articles that have the same claims. And what we have
found is that we have made our policies very difficult, I
think, for those individuals that need our assistance the most.
That is one of the reasons that we made some changes to our
policies ahead of hurricane season last year by changing the
type of documentation that we accept for both homeowners, as
well as renters, which has accounted for close to 100,000
additional individuals being eligible for FEMA assistance that
in the past we would have denied.
But we have also, and I think maybe even more specific to
your question, we used to have a set threshold for individuals
to be eligible for our direct housing program, and it
inadvertently discriminated against people that have lower
incomes or lower value homes. And so, one of the other changes
that we made was moving from a set threshold to a price per
square foot. So, regardless of the home's value, everybody had
an equal opportunity to be able to be eligible for our program.
And that resulted in an additional 2,700 families being
eligible for direct housing after Hurricane Ida.
Ms. Norton. Thank you very much. I see my time is expired.
Ms. Titus. Thank you. We will now go to Mr. Massie.
Mr. Massie. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
In 2011 and 2012, I was a county executive in a rural
county, and we had been struck by floods, flooding, before I
came into office and when I came into office. And when I came
into office, we were still trying to get the disaster relief
from the previous event, from before I was elected to that
office. And then, when we had an event, it was understood that
help from FEMA would be months, if not years, away in this
process.
And I contrast that with these folks from the USDA--and I
am sorry I don't know the exact name of these programs--but
they came in at the speed of need and looked at the disaster
and said, ``OK, we are going to authorize this, and we will
reimburse you as soon as we can.'' These were, literally, roads
and bridges that had been washed away, and people needed to get
to work, school buses needed to go on these roads. And again,
it is a small rural county budget, where you don't--if you had
the resources to fix it immediately, you wouldn't need FEMA.
But we didn't have those resources.
So, that was always something that was frustrating. And I
wondered why the USDA, under a much smaller program, was able
to come in and do these things in a matter of days, whereas
FEMA was going to take months and years. And I am sure things
have improved somewhat since then. But can you talk about how
you might be able to coordinate, or how you have coordinated,
or will coordinate with other agencies to increase the speed?
I know you have trouble recruiting the people that will go
and do this assistance, but maybe those people already exist in
other agencies.
Ms. Criswell. Congressman Massie, I can't speak
specifically to what you are talking about with USDA. I am
happy to have my team get back with your staff to find out
exactly which specific program you are referencing. But there
are different authorities and different jurisdictions that
Federal agencies have responsibility for.
Some of our projects are very complex when we are going in,
and it may seem like a simple project to repair a road, but it
could be a very complicated project that has environmental
reviews. And so, we do work closely with the communities to
make sure that we are understanding what it is that they want
to do and they need to do.
We also have the ability to do expedited project worksheets
for some of the costs that they incurred early on, so we can
help get them back on that road to recovery quicker.
There are some other mechanisms that we can use to work
with communities to help them through this process because I do
understand, I was a local emergency manager in Aurora,
Colorado, and sometimes those resources are [inaudible] readily
available upfront. I mean, so, we do have teams that can work
with communities to better understand what their cash flow
needs are, and how we can assist them in getting these projects
off the ground.
Mr. Massie. Thank you very much. Yes, just understand that
for small rural communities, $200,000 provided within a week of
the disaster is sometimes worth $2 million that is provided a
year later, after the work has already been done and the county
has already had to put the money out. So, thank you for being
sensitive to that. We need help at the speed of need.
Another question that I have is the private sector employs
modern technology to more accurately and, in a timely fashion,
assess damages after an event, after a hurricane or a tornado
or something like that. And a small sampling of FEMA
assessments following Hurricane Michael indicated that the
private-sector method was more accurate in assessing damage.
Has FEMA explored testing new technologies to speed up the
process?
Ms. Criswell. Yes, absolutely. I think that one of the
things that we have actually learned through the last 2 years
with COVID-19 is our ability to do some of the things that we
would normally do in person using technology more. And we are
continuing to gather the information of where we were able to
improve the delivery of our assistance. In some cases, it
wasn't as effective. And we want to be able to use this
technology, though, to help us advance the way that we are
making these damage estimates going forward.
We have always used things like GIS to help us get a better
picture of what the overall extent of the damage is, and that
has really helped us get the declarations declared faster.
I think we do have work to do, and am happy to partner with
and get information about the specific private-sector
methodologies that you referenced that can help us continue to
improve how we are also doing that.
Mr. Massie. Thank you very much. I yield back.
Ms. Titus. Thank you. I now recognize Mrs. Napolitano.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Chairman Titus.
And Honorable Criswell, I have several questions. I might
have to submit them for the record.
But first of all, in your strategic plan, diversifying the
workforce or recruiting from minority-serving institutions, you
don't list the Hispanic-serving institutions. Because there is
quite a gap sometimes in getting information in the language
people understand. And as was said before, sometimes they are
not able to navigate the whole process.
I am concerned also about the GAO report on high turnover
and staff declining employment due to burnout. What mental
health services does FEMA provide to its member workforce who
are responding to repeated climate disasters?
Has there been an effort to recruit in the communities that
are experiencing repeated disasters, such as community colleges
and local technical schools? And that is the number-one
question.
Number two, the second goal of FEMA's strategic plan is to
make communities more climate resilient. What recommendations
does FEMA have for communities facing greater intensity of
natural disasters?
What agency do you work with to be able to provide
information also in coordinating, sharing information, such as
SBA and other agencies?
And what recommendation do you have for policy changes that
this committee might take into consideration?
And I understand one of my communities had flood damage
from the mud runoff from a mountain after a fire, yet they
didn't qualify because they had to be declared a Federal
disaster. Is there something they can apply for within the
Federal Government?
Ms. Criswell. Congresswoman Napolitano, on the workforce
side of things, thank you for bringing up the observation
regarding Hispanic institutions. We are working across all of
the different minority-serving institutions, as well, as part
of our recruitment campaign to try to reach out to this next
generation of emergency managers. I think that we have many
different aspects that we are trying to engage in, in order to
build that diverse workforce.
And one of the things that I think is really important that
we are doing is through our FEMA employee resource groups. I
mean, we have 10 different employee resource groups that
represent a variety of different cultures across our Agency,
and they have been great advocates in helping us in our
recruitment efforts to try and----
Mrs. Napolitano [interrupting]. Ms. Criswell?
Ms. Criswell. Yes, ma'am.
Mrs. Napolitano. I have a little time left, so I want to be
sure that I focus in on whether--like in California, for the
fire, are you recruiting California institutions? And which
ones, so I can work with them to make sure that information
about recruitment is in their hands.
Ms. Criswell. I would be happy to have my team follow up
with your staff on the specific institutions that we have been
working with, so----
Mrs. Napolitano [interposing]. Great, thank you.
Ms. Criswell [continuing]. You can help us in that
recruitment effort. And thank you very much for that.
On the climate resilience side--and I am sorry, could you
repeat the question, the second question that you had?
Mrs. Napolitano. What recommendations does FEMA have for
the communities facing greater frequency, and how are you
working with other agencies to share information to make the
barriers lower for people who can't navigate, or don't navigate
the system well?
Ms. Criswell. So, I think the amount of funding that we
have been able to put in last year to hazard mitigation, close
to $5 billion between the BRIC program and our HMGP program, is
really going to be instrumental in our ability to reduce the
impacts that we are seeing from disasters across the country.
Mrs. Napolitano. Such as what? What would you focus on? The
fires, the floods, the hurricanes?
Ms. Criswell. Yes, I think it depends on each specific
community, right? It is eligible for any of those activities.
And so, for example, in California, California received one
of the highest rated projects for wildfire mitigation under our
BRIC program. They also have funding under our HMGP program
that can be used for any of the other types of hazards that
they have.
And so, we are partnering with agencies like NASA and NOAA
to help better get data that is specific for jurisdictions to
use to understand what their risk is, so they can use that
knowledge to build the type of applications to better utilize
this funding to have more of a communitywide impact on their
specific risks.
Mrs. Napolitano. OK. Pardon me, but what about the mental
health process delivery to your employees?
Ms. Criswell. An incredibly important topic. The mental
health and well-being of our workforce has been one of my
primary considerations.
We just came off of responding to 2 years of COVID-19,
along with many other disasters. And my team, they are
strained, right? They have been doing some hard work and
helping people during their worst times. And so, we are always
very concerned about their mental health and well-being.
We have put some programs in place here, and we have
resources that are available. And one of the things that I have
gotten the most feedback on from our employees is that we
pushed out to everybody's mobile devices the Headspace app, so
they could have a resource and a tool that was available to
them any time that they needed it to just kind of take that
mental break.
But that is just one of many different things that we have
been doing here through--we have counselors that are here,
psychologists that are here to help individuals, and we do
webinars to really make sure that we are putting that mental
health first and foremost for our employees.
Mrs. Napolitano. Yes, but sometimes they don't realize they
need help.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I yield back.
Ms. Titus. Thank you. We will now recognize Ms. Van Duyne.
Ms. Van Duyne. Thank you very much.
And thank you very much, Administrator Criswell, for being
here.
I have yet to encounter a racist natural disaster, but it
seems to be what some of my colleagues here today are
suggesting. There are legitimate victims of natural disasters,
and I would hope that that would be where our focus is, and not
on those manufactured victims by identity politics. I am very
confused about what is happening here today.
I worked for HUD for 2\1/2\ years, and I worked at a time
during Hurricane Harvey, representing Texas, and great States
like Louisiana, through their hardships.
And there are some wonderful people at FEMA. Your RA,
region 6 RA, Tony Robinson, is phenomenal. He can tell you
firsthand about some of the experiences that we have had
working with people.
We are trying to give them streamlined help, going through
some of the worst experiences in their lifetime, and making
sure that they get the help that they need when they need it,
and that the other departments are working hand in glove, like
FEMA and HUD.
One of the most experienced people that I talked to during
this time was Representative Garret Graves from Louisiana. And
that is who I am going to yield the balance of my time to,
Representative Graves.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Ms. Van Duyne, and I
want to thank you for your work with HUD.
Administrator, Congresswoman Van Duyne brings up a really
good point. She brought up the fact that FEMA and HUD and
disasters are not--they don't discriminate in any way, shape,
or form. Yet under FEMA's policies, under FMA and under BRIC,
the Flood Management Assistance and the BRIC program through
the predisaster mitigation dollars, the programs are
participating in the White House Justice40 initiative, which I
will make note, again, was not something that Congress ever
passed. And under that program, a minimum of 40 percent of the
funds are going to go toward communities that are,
``disadvantaged.''
Look, we represent Cajun folks. We represent Tribal
communities, folks that have been disadvantaged by the Federal
Government. There is no transparency in how these funds are
going to be distributed, none. And I just want to know what we
need to be telling our folks at home. Are they going to be
discriminated against through this Justice40 initiative?
Ms. Criswell. I think that it is a really important topic
that we need to have a conversation about. When I talk about
underserved communities, I am talking about any community
across this country that we have seen that has been
disproportionately impacted by disasters. I have seen a number
of those communities in Louisiana. I have seen a number of
those communities in Texas.
Our goal with all of our programs is to make sure that we
are working really closely with our State directors to better
identify the communities within their States, because they know
their communities best, to help them apply for the assistance
that is available.
Because we are talking about small communities. I am
talking about rural communities in the Midwest that have staffs
of one or two people that just don't have the capacity to apply
and navigate the bureaucracy that we have to get the type of
resources that are available.
So, I am committed----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. So, I mean, but
what about communities in south Louisiana, in Texas, in
Florida, in New York, in New Jersey, in North Carolina and
other places that, in my opinion, are being discriminated
against by FEMA through Risk Rating 2.0 by the huge surge in
their flood insurance rates?
Are those people going to get a disproportionate amount of
assistance from FEMA to help to make these communities safer
whenever the vulnerability they are experiencing has nothing to
do with anything they have done?
Ms. Criswell. Yes, the numbers that we are showing right
now, as Risk Rating 2.0 has just been rolled out, is that 90
percent of the individuals had either a reduction or the same
level of increase that they would have had under the previous
program. In the previous program, everybody would have had an
increase.
But we do understand that there are some parts of the
program and there are some individuals that are going to see
much larger increases in this. And that is why there are two
things that we are working with, right? One is that nobody will
see an increase of more than 18 percent per year. But two, we
are working with Congress on an affordability plan, because we
do recognize that there are individuals that are going to have
a hard time with this.
We completely support the Affordability Act to make sure
that everybody has equitable access to the insurance premiums
that----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. But Madam
Administrator, what is happening under Risk Rating 2.0 is you
are charging people for ``increased risk'' that FEMA has
identified that these people had nothing to do with. They built
their home in compliance with standards.
The solution here is actually to build better flood
protection. That is the solution in every State, not to go out
there and charge these people unaffordable rates.
I want to make one last point. You have your climate--I am
sorry.
Ms. Titus. Sorry.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you.
Ms. Titus. OK, thank you. I just can't sit here and have
someone say we are making up racist disasters. I have to
respond to that.
You heard Ms. Norton quoting a New York Times article that
White communities were much more likely to get an extra amount
of Individual Assistance funds than Black communities. I mean,
the figures are there. This is not something you are making up.
Underprivileged communities are those that often are in the
most disaster-prone areas, whether it comes to flood, or air
pollution, or these heat zones. This is evidence out there in
the statistics. This is not something this committee is making
up to try to have some racist policy to benefit some groups
over others. We are trying to do away with that, and have a
more equitable policy. So, those kinds of, just, throwaway
remarks are just--you just--you have got to--there is no
evidence for that, and we are just not going to let it stand.
Now we will recognize Mr. Stanton.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, for the
opportunity to join the subcommittee here today. Administrator
Criswell, welcome.
The city of Maricopa in my home State of Arizona is growing
at an exponential rate. At incorporation in 2003, the city had
only 1,500 residents. Today, it has nearly 70,000, and is
averaging nearly 150 residential housing permits per month.
The city had been working with the Corps of Engineers on a
regional flood control solution, but it became too costly, and
would have required the city to remove a 1-mile swath of land
from development. Instead, the city proposes to build a project
that will protect residents and businesses from flooding
without hindering its growth.
The city submitted its first set of plans to FEMA in
February for review, and I, along with every Member of the
Arizona congressional delegation, sent you a letter requesting
an expedited review. How can FEMA expedite consideration of
this important project to ensure that the city is able to get
the flood protection it needs?
Ms. Criswell. Congressman Stanton, thank you very much for
that. We have received your letter regarding this map revision.
It is currently under review. I did check with my team recently
on the status of that. We do expect a response in the next 40
days or so on what the next steps are going to be as we work
with the city of Maricopa on what they need to do next.
Mr. Stanton. I appreciate that. We are anxiously awaiting
that response. This actually is not in my district, but it is
important to all of Maricopa County. So, myself and all of the
Arizona delegation anxiously await your response.
When migrant families arrive at our southern border, the
Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Government turn
to local communities to deliver humanitarian assistance
necessary to meet their needs. From shelter to food to
clothing, local NGOs provide these essential services.
One way that NGOs are able to provide this assistance is
through FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter Program. Now, in many
Arizona communities, those NGOs are not large entities. They
are small churches and small nonprofits with limited staff and
minimal resources.
The fiscal year 2022 funding bill includes $150 million for
the Emergency Food and Shelter Program to specifically provide
shelter and other services to families and individuals
encountered by the Department. How does FEMA ensure the notice
of funding opportunity for these resources reaches all
potential eligible applicants, including small nonprofits like
those in Arizona?
Ms. Criswell. Thank you, Congressman. The Emergency Food
and Shelter Program is an incredibly valuable resource for this
humanitarian mission, and we do have $150 million that is
available to go to nonprofits to help with this mission.
This program is a grant that is funded by FEMA, and it is
given to a board. And that board makes the decisions on how
that information or how that funding is distributed. I would be
happy to get back to you and your team with some specifics on
how they do their outreach when the funding is available.
Mr. Stanton. We would very much like that followup.
What opportunities exist to increase local NGO awareness of
these resources and provide expanded support to ensure that
they are able to apply for these funds?
Ms. Criswell. I think that we have many programs that we
can tap into to help increase that.
First, our Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood
Partnerships has done a lot of outreach to nonprofits to help
them understand the many programs that are available to them,
in addition to this one.
So, we can continue to work with your staff if there is
something specific that we are not reaching. Like, if there is
a specific example where we haven't been able to get to those
communities, I would like to know that so then we can work on
our outreach and engagement plan to ensure we are getting this
information out to all of those that could utilize some of
these resources.
Mr. Stanton. That is very much appreciated. We will look
forward to that followup, and having a deeper conversation
about some of the smaller organizations in Arizona that need
these resources, because they provide essential services to
communities in need.
With that, I yield back.
Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Stanton.
Well, that concludes the questions that we have. I am at
the end of the hearing.
But Mr. Webster, do you have any final remarks?
Mr. Webster of Florida. I don't, thank you.
Ms. Titus. Well, thank you so much, Administrator. We very
much appreciate your being here. We have got some answers and
some additional questions that we would like to follow through
with.
I also want to thank you and FEMA for all their help during
COVID. I know they were really on the front lines in Nevada,
and I am sure in other places, too.
I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing
remain open until such time as our witness provides answers to
any of the questions that may be submitted to her in writing.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 days for any additional comments and information
submitted by Members or the witness to be included in the
record of today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
And Administrator, I hope you will put somebody on your
team with our office, so we can talk further about having that
roundtable, which I think would be very valuable in getting
some people from the industry there, many of whom are former
FEMA employees, as well. So, we look forward to working with
you on that.
And the committee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:19 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Submissions for the Record

Prepared Statement of Hon. Sam Graves, a Representative in Congress
from the State of Missouri, and Ranking Member, Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure
Thank you, Chair Titus, and thank you to Administrator Criswell for
being here today.
On a bipartisan basis, this committee has worked to improve FEMA
and the federal government's emergency management system.
Unfortunately, what we continue to see on the ground is a slow and
confusing process of rebuilding after a disaster.
For example, despite the work we have done to ensure there is more
support for investment in mitigation, communities in my district are
still seeing a significant amount of red tape when they try to build-in
mitigation.
It helps no one when communities must spend significant resources
to figure out how to fill out FEMA paperwork and navigate the process.
They certainly should not find it this difficult to build-in
mitigation--a priority we all support.
That is why I introduced bipartisan bills, including the Preventing
Disaster Revictimization Act and the SPEED Recovery Act, to help
individuals and communities cut through the red tape in FEMA
assistance.
I look forward to hearing from Administrator Criswell today on
these and other issues.
Thank you, Chair Titus. I yield back.

Statement of the BuildStrong Coalition, Submitted for the Record by
Hon. Dina Titus
Thank you for the opportunity for the BuildStrong Coalition to
submit a statement for the record for the Subcommittee's hearing,
``FEMA Priorities for 2022 and the 2022-2026 Strategic Plan'' focusing
on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) priorities for the
upcoming year as well as for the strategic plan years 2022-2026.
Chairman Titus and Ranking Member Webster are to be commended for
leading the subcommittee in prioritizing the need for disaster
mitigation and resilience investments as a core component of the
national conversation on resilient infrastructure and communities. This
committee's leadership on the Resilient Assistance Mitigation for
Environmentally Resilient Infrastructure and Construction by Americans
(AMERICA) Act (H.R.5689), which overwhelmingly passed the House by a
vote of 383-41 on April 5, 2022, was a major step in having this much-
needed legislation enacted into law. This significant piece of
legislation will facilitate historical resources and incentives to help
American communities invest in cost-effective, risk reducing disaster
mitigation efforts that will help make our nation more resilient. Smart
investments in lifeline infrastructure and community resilience are the
best way to address the threat of worsening disasters. The BuildStrong
Coalition is honored to continue our role to drive the focus on laws,
policies, and programs that aid in the creation of a disaster resilient
nation. We remain ready to continue this work and are prepared to serve
as a resource to advance your commitment to enhancing our country's
resilience profile.
The BuildStrong Coalition, formed in 2011 to respond to an
increasing number of severe disasters, is made up of a diverse group of
members representing firefighters, emergency responders, emergency
managers, insurers, engineers, architects, contractors, and
manufacturers, as well as consumer organizations, code specialists, and
many others committed to building a more disaster resilient nation. The
BuildStrong Coalition has been a partner with Congress's work to
investigate causes of, and devise the solutions to, the rising costs
and impacts of disasters in the U.S. over the past decade. We have been
honored to present witnesses and participants in hearings, roundtables,
and briefings to identify opportunities for policy changes that promote
mitigation and the smart investment of federal resources to address our
country's increasing number of severe and costly weather events,
including informing several key provisions of this Subcommittee's
Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA) (P.L. 115-254) and we will
continue to work with your colleagues in the Senate on the Resilient
AMERICA Act to ensure its passage into law.
In our statement for the previous hearing on stakeholder
perspectives held in February, we outlined critical policy
recommendations and principles that are supported by data and science
that should be included in FEMA's community resilience priorities for
the year. These priorities included: securing more resources for
mitigation, increasing the resiliency of the nation's lifeline
infrastructure, including power and electric grids, facilitating the
creation of resilient homes and communities through strong building
codes, easing the administrative burden of the BRIC program, and
increasing technical resources and building the capacity and capability
to identify risks. The BuildStrong Coalition was delighted to hear the
FEMA Administrator emphasize the importance of these priorities
throughout her testimony.
Relevant to the committee's April 5 hearing, we'd like to highlight
some of these key priorities:
Driving Resilient Homes and Communities through Strong Building Codes
Individuals and communities are kept safe in times of disasters
through the strength of their homes. This is particularly prevalent as
we learn lessons from COVID-19 and begin to understand how to increase
resilience to wildfires. Disaster-resilient and sustainable
construction and the use of stronger building codes have been proven to
save lives, reduce the damage of natural disasters, and protect the
environment. Unfortunately, only a handful of states have adopted the
most modern building codes, and many lack the resources to adequately
implement codes. To help correct this paradigm at the federal level
involves creating incentives that encourage state and local governments
to adopt modern building codes, while simultaneously equipping
communities with the tools and resources needed to carry out meaningful
enforcement regimes. Through the BRIC program, some states without a
statewide adoption of building codes have a hard time being competitive
for funding to do code development or code enforcement projects when
having a statewide building code is part of the funding point scoring
system and in line with the intent of Congress and DRRA.
The President's 2023 Budget Request for FEMA includes a request for
``funding and personnel to continue the implementation of a Federal and
National Building Codes Strategy to advance the adoption of disaster-
resistant building codes at the State and local level.'' This will
place a Building Codes Specialist in every Region to better work with
State, Local, Tribal, and Territory (SLTT) and other external partners.
The BuildStrong Coalition is supportive of a Federal and National
Building Codes Strategy and would like to see FEMA work closer with
external partners to explore ways to utilize volunteers and/or
nonprofits to offer ways to provide additional technical assistance and
building code enforcement resources to communities, specifically more
vulnerable communities.
It is important to note that the Resilient AMERICA Act would assist
FEMA in their strategic priority of increasing building code adoption
and assist with the Federal and National Building Codes Strategy. If
passed into law, Resilient AMERICA would set aside no less than 10% in
BRIC (Stafford Sec. 203) to fund the adoption and enforcement of the
latest consensus-based building codes and standards. Eligible
activities will also include training of code-enforcement officials.
The adoption and enforcement of the latest building codes is one of the
most impactful steps in bolstering community resilience.
Easing Administrative Burdens for the BRIC Program and Increasing
Technical Resources
The BuildStrong Coalition was also pleased to hear Administrator
Criswell address a consistent criticism of the BRIC program that we
have heard repeatedly: that its dollars are going to wealthier areas
with better access to resources to pay for tools like consultants and
technical information/capabilities to build out application packets
that are, naturally, more competitive. Theoretically, localities that
are most in need of funding for mitigation are largely those that do
not have the reserves to spend on outside resources for applications.
FEMA currently provides BRIC technical assistance for up to twenty
low-income communities.\1\ We were delighted to hear that FEMA is
working to increase the number of communities that technical assistance
is being provided. The BuildStrong Coalition will continue to monitor
how FEMA is addressing this concern and we will continue to explore
ways that we can offer increased technical assistance to their
stakeholders.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ BRIC Direct Technical Assistance (fema.gov)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The BuildStrong Coalition and its members stand ready to partner
with the committee as it drives mitigation and resilience against
disaster and climate impacts. The compelling arguments for these policy
changes are grounded in overwhelming science and evidence. We are
excited to join congressional leaders like you as we identify
opportunities for policy changes that promote disaster resilience and
the smart investment of federal resources to address our country's
vulnerable infrastructure and the increasing number of severe and
costly weather events. Together, we can help save the lives and homes
of our citizens.

Appendix

----------

Questions from Hon. Peter A. DeFazio to Hon. Deanne Criswell,
Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of
Homeland Security

Question 1. What progress has FEMA made to help other federal
agencies implement the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and
achieve greater disaster resilience within their programs?
Answer. As co-lead of the Flood Resilience Interagency Working
Group, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides
indispensable leadership to Executive Branch efforts to implement the
Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (FFRMS). These efforts include
support to align federal grant requirements, programs, and data tools
to ensure successful implementation of the FFRMS and associated
floodplain management regulations. Given the importance of building
resilience for the entire nation and reducing federal investment
exposure to increasing flood risk, FEMA has begun implementing the
FFRMS to the full extent its current regulatory authorities allow. FEMA
shares both its partial and full implementation approaches with Federal
Agency partners, promoting faster, more consistent, and more effective
implementation across the Federal Government. FEMA's floodplain maps
and technical expertise are the foundation of the FFRMS, and FEMA has
launched an initiative to develop future flood conditions data and
mapping products that will provide actionable information necessary to
fully implement the three FFRMS approaches described in Executive Order
13690: Establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a
Process for Further Soliciting and Considering Stakeholder Input (i.e.,
Climate-Informed Science Approach, 0.2-Percent-Annual-Chance Flood
Approach, and Freeboard Value Approach). FEMA, together with the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, are working on the
development of a decision support tool that integrates FEMA mapping
products and will assist Federal and non-Federal partners in
determining whether their actions are subject to the FFRMS
requirements. Additionally, FEMA provides technical assistance and
training through consultation to other federal agencies on Executive
Order 11988: Floodplain Management, as amended by Executive Order
13690.

Question 2. The current post-disaster assistance model often
requires survivors to file applications with multiple federal agencies.
Has FEMA worked with SBA and HUD to develop a universal application for
assistance, so survivors aren't bounced back and forth between
agencies?
Answer. FEMA has discussed a universal application with the U.S.
Small Business Administration (SBA) and U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD), as well as other federal agencies, and plans
on continuing these discussions, which will help FEMA better understand
the SBA and HUD application processes and plan for integrating them
with FEMA's process. In addition, we continue to work with both SBA and
HUD on additional ways that we can share data to support survivors'
needs and streamline the application experience. FEMA is currently
working to streamline its own registration intake process to simplify
the experience for survivors.

Question 3. How does FEMA ensure accurate and timely cost estimates
are utilized in Section 428 proceedings?
Answer. FEMA ensures accurate and timely cost estimates are
developed or validated for Public Assistance (PA) Applicants during the
project formulation process, which includes adherence to deadlines,
applying technical expertise from subject matter experts, utilizing
industry standard resources and other sources of cost data, and
utilizing internal tools designed to facilitate efficient and effective
project formulation.
During the grant or project formulation phase of the PA grant
lifecycle, FEMA either validates an Applicant-provided cost estimate or
develops a cost estimate when the Applicant does not provide one.
FEMA's process for developing and validating cost estimates is the same
for projects formulated under both standard procedures and Alternative
Procedures for Permanent Work under Section 428 of The Robert T.
Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act Stafford Act, as
described in FEMA's Public Assistance Program and Policy Guide (PAPPG)
and other published PA policies, guidance, and fact sheets.
Deadlines
Applicants have up to 18 months from the disaster declaration date
to accept a Fixed Cost Estimate (FCE) for a project. Furthermore, once
FEMA transmits the offer of a FCE, the Grantee and Applicant have a
combined total of 30 calendar days from the date of FEMA's transmittal
to accept the offer, not to exceed the 18-month deadline. Projects
without an accepted FCE by the 30-day and 18-month deadlines revert to
standard procedures, instead of using Alternative Procedures for
Permanent Work.
Although the overall deadline for Applicants to accept a FCE is 18
months, FEMA averages 20 days to develop or validate the FCE at a PA
Consolidated Resource Center (CRC).
Technical Expertise
FEMA utilizes the technical expertise of professionally licensed
engineers and architects, qualified cost estimators, construction
managers, and staff with other areas of expertise as needed to develop
and validate cost estimates. Additionally, FEMA's project formulation
process requires that FEMA reviews all projects with Applicants to
ensure a project is accurate, including the Scope of Work and the
developed or validated cost estimate.
Cost Data
When developing a cost estimate, FEMA utilizes published unit costs
from national cost estimating databases. In applying this method, FEMA
confirms that the cost publication is current and for large permanent
work projects, prepares the cost estimate using the Cost Estimating
Format, a uniform methodology for determining the cost of eligible
permanent work for large projects, and the appropriate locality
adjustment factor. This published cost data may come from:

Industry standard construction cost estimating resources:
When appropriate local data cannot be developed or obtained, FEMA uses
industry standard construction cost estimating resources to prepare an
estimate against which to evaluate the reasonableness of the
Applicant's actual costs. These cost estimating resources include, but
are not limited to, RSMeans, BNi Costbooks, Marshall and Swift, and
Sweet's Unit Cost Guide, all of which are widely accepted in the
construction industry and available for nationwide use.

Federal, State, or Territorial unit costs: When industry
standard construction cost estimating resources do not provide work
items that are appropriate or applicable to the construction activities
required to complete the project, FEMA considers local cost data from
other Federal, State, or Territorial agencies responsible for
construction of similar facilities in or near the locality.

FEMA Cost Codes: FEMA maintains a database of regional
and national unit prices (cost codes). FEMA cost codes may be used when
a cost is not found in other published cost data resources or if the
FEMA cost codes are otherwise more applicable than other published
costs, such as for force account equipment.
Internal Tools
When validating an Applicant-provided cost estimate, FEMA utilizes
internal tools designed to facilitate efficient and effective project
formulation, including checklists. Specifically, FEMA evaluates an
Applicant-provided cost estimate for reasonableness based on the
criteria in the PAPPG, Chapter 6.I. Reasonable Costs using a checklist
described in Appendix L: Validation of Applicant Provided Cost
Estimates. If FEMA determines any of the costs to be unreasonable based
on its evaluation, FEMA may disallow all or part of the costs by
adjusting eligible funding to an amount it determines to be reasonable.
When determining the reasonable amount, FEMA may use the least-cost
alternative, the lowest bid received by the Applicant, or the pricing
of another Applicant's properly procured and selected contractor.

Question 4. Utilization of Section 428 implies that the recipient
accepts a fixed-cost estimate, but FEMA and GAO have both attributed
delays to the process of determining, validating, and establishing
consensus on fixed-cost estimates. Given the aim of expediting and
increasing flexibility of public assistance, how does FEMA intend to
incorporate Congressional intent into its guidance?
Answer. In the immediate term, FEMA has taken action to simplify
the grant development process particularly for large, complex projects
that are candidates for Section 428. These improvements include
deploying technical staff to work directly with Applicants earlier in
the process and ensuring that FEMA field senior leadership has final
approval on significant eligibility decisions. In addition, the PA
Division is assessing its program, the CRCs, and the PA National
Delivery Model to evaluate the impact on applicants and identify short,
medium, and long-term recommendations for change that improve
effectiveness and offer the maximum level of efficiency and support to
FEMA partners. The assessment is considering effectiveness of remote
personnel to support disaster needs, documentation requirements, and
program progress against established metrics. The PA Assessment team is
not specifically scoped to consider fixed-cost estimates under Section
428, but the Team will be exploring the issue related to delay in the
Section 428 process as an element of understanding root causes and
guiding development of recommendations toward streamlining the PA
process. Based on the findings, FEMA can incorporate it into our
guidance.

Questions from Hon. Dina Titus to Hon. Deanne Criswell, Administrator,
Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of Homeland
Security

Question 1. The 221,000-acre Caldor Fire caused tremendous
environmental damage to the Lake Tahoe Region and threatened
communities within the Basin. Post fire assessments show that fuel
reduction treatments and water infrastructure improvements
significantly helped mitigate the wildfire's impact in the Basin.
I understand that under the BRIC program, projects to help
municipal water infrastructure improve firefighting capacity to
mitigate a wildfire are not eligible for assistance. This includes the
installation of high-capacity water storage tanks, accelerated
replacement of undersized waterlines, and new fire hydrant
installation, all of which played a significant role in mitigating the
Caldor Fire.
1.a.  Why aren't proven water infrastructure projects for fire
suppression eligible for hazard mitigation assistance through FEMA?
1.b.  Does FEMA need additional authorities from Congress to allow
these projects to receive funding?
Answer to 1.a. & 1.b. The activities noted above are important fire
suppression functions in a community; however, these activities are not
long-term risk reduction measures as it relates to hazard mitigation.
FEMA has determined improving fire suppression capabilities is not
an eligible hazard mitigation activity because it does not directly
address the occurrence or severity of wildfires, but rather only
improves response capabilities. Other FEMA programs are better suited
to provide assistance for wildfire preparedness and response
capabilities, such as the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program and
the Fire Management Assistance Grant Program.
Specifically, hazard mitigation is defined as any sustained action
taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from
natural hazards and their effects. This definition distinguishes
actions that have a long-term impact from those that are more closely
associated with immediate preparedness, response, and recovery
activities.
Hazard mitigation is the only phase of emergency management
specifically dedicated to breaking the cycle of damage, reconstruction,
and repeated damage. Accordingly, States, territories, federally-
recognized tribes, and local communities are encouraged to take
advantage of funding that Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) programs
provide in both the pre- and post-disaster timelines.

Question 2. I understand that FEMA's disaster temporary housing
repair program was recently discontinued. This program allowed repairs
to damaged homes so storm survivors could shelter in place. During the
2021 hurricane season, the lack of housing resources resulting from
this discontinuation became problematic according to stakeholders I
have spoken with.
Does FEMA plan to launch another disaster housing program, perhaps
one that provides greater flexibility for state and local governments
to oversee the relevant FEMA funds? We saw during last hurricane season
that not having a plan pre-disaster was problematic.
Answer. FEMA does not have plans to re-authorize the Sheltering and
Temporary Essential Power (STEP) pilot program under Section 403 of the
Stafford Act. After piloting the STEP program in disasters, FEMA
analyzed the accomplishments of the STEP pilot program and found that
it could not be implemented effectively within FEMA's statutory
authorities. Also, the costs to implement the program were significant
compared to the useful life and durability of the repairs provided to
disaster survivors. FEMA's analysis determined the STEP pilot program:

Failed to address immediate threats to life and property
due to the extended time it took to identify properties and complete
temporary repairs; and

Failed to address the need for sheltering, as actual
repair timeframes did not relieve the pressure on congregate
sheltering.

This determination does not mean that FEMA does not recognize
direct repair activities may provide significant promise as a part of a
comprehensive strategy for housing recovery efforts following future
major disasters like Hurricane Ida, particularly when implemented by
state and local governments that have taken measures to scope and
prepare for implementing a housing repair program.
Section 403 of the Stafford Act limits direct repairs to only those
that would make a home livable as a shelter and Section 408 places a
very restrictive legal standard for FEMA to approve Permanent Housing
Construction (PHC). It requires FEMA to demonstrate that no alternative
housing resources, including temporary housing, are available. It then
requires FEMA to complete a business analysis that compares and
contrasts temporary housing against PHC, permitting PHC only where it
is practicable compared to temporary housing in terms of availability,
cost, and time. Despite these restrictions, Section 408 is a more
appropriate authority for providing repairs to owner-occupied
residences to assist displaced disaster survivors than Section 403
FEMA's authority to award grants to states under the Disaster Recovery
Reform Act (DRRA) pilot program expired on October 5, 2020. FEMA
remains committed to partnering with states to collaboratively explore
innovative solutions to improve how we deliver vital post-disaster
sheltering options and housing solutions following major disasters.

Questions from Hon. Michael Guest to Hon. Deanne Criswell,
Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of
Homeland Security

Question 1. Congress provides FEMA with supplemental appropriations
for disaster mitigation, but the recognized needs exceed federal
assistance. With respect to floodplain buyouts, recent research
concludes there is a growing urban-rural divide in terms of FEMA-funded
efforts. According to the University of North Carolina, for every
dollar in flood-related damages, highly urbanized areas receive
approximately $0.54 in mitigation funds, while rural areas receive
approximately $0.11.
1.a.  Why are rural areas so underserved? What role does local
government capacity play in rural areas versus larger urban areas in
terms of accessing FEMA's mitigation programs?
1.b.  Since rural areas are underserved by FEMA's mitigation
programs, and local government capacity may impact these discrepancies,
what would be FEMA's feedback regarding public-private partnerships in
these rural areas to accelerate recovery and mitigation activities,
like floodplain buyouts?
Answer to 1.a. & 1.b. We would need to review the University of
North Carolina study to have a better understanding of precisely what
parameters were under consideration. On the face of it, one would
expect to see relatively higher amounts of funding in urban versus
rural areas because of the higher concentration and greater numbers of
structures and infrastructure as compared to rural areas. At its most
basic level, mitigation is designed to reduce risk to people and
property (including structures and infrastructure) so it follows that
funding would be relatively higher in urban areas.
We do recognize that local capability and capacity play a large
role in determining who ultimately receives funding from our mitigation
grant programs. To that end we have been in a continuous improvement
process to increase and enhance local capability and capacity while
also distributing grant funding in a more equitable manner. Recent
directives such as Executive Order 13985--Advancing Racial Equity and
Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government and
the Justice40 Initiative, provide an overarching framework for how we
will administer mitigation grants going forward.
The different grants under FEMA's HMA program, including Hazard
Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Building Resilient Infrastructure and
Communities (BRIC), and Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA), have varying
amounts of control over funding priorities. Under HMGP and HMGP Post
Fire, recipients determine their own priorities, but under BRIC and
FMA, the priorities are set by FEMA through the annual Notice of
Funding Opportunity (NOFO). Applicants under all programs set their
mitigation priorities using their FEMA-approved Hazard Mitigation Plan
as a guide, which helps to inform project development and submission.
Floods are the most common natural hazards in the United States. As
such, over the last 30 years, HMA grant programs have provided
approximately $3.47 billion in Federal funding to acquire and demolish
over 50,000 properties. This is a significant investment in the
mitigation of flood-prone structures--eliminating the potential for any
future damage or loss of life on the associated parcels. Acquisition
projects have proven to be an effective means to immediately increase
community flood resiliency. While property acquisition is the most
common project type under HMA grant programs, there is a variety of
other eligible project types that also mitigate flood-related damages
and accelerate community recovery. These include, but are not limited
to, elevations, relocations, floodproofing of structures, and localized
flood risk reduction projects (e.g., retention/detention basins,
floodwalls, weirs, etc.). A priority of HMA is to ensure adequate
alternatives so communities can select the most appropriate project
type for its citizens.
BRIC and FMA are competitive grant programs where projects are
evaluated against the qualitative and technical criteria outlined in
each respective NOFO. BRIC and FMA have both revised their evaluation
criteria for future annual grant cycles to help underserved communities
that have been historically more vulnerable to natural hazards and
disproportionally affected by the impacts of climate change. Under
BRIC, applicants that are deemed ``Economically Disadvantaged Rural
Communities'' are eligible for up to a 90 percent federal cost share--
significantly higher than the standard 75 percent. The Swift Current
Initiative seeks to substantially speed up the award of FMA funding
after a flooding event and reduce the complexity of the application
process. The goal of FMA Swift Current is to obligate flood mitigation
dollars for NFIP-insured repetitive loss, severe repetitive loss, and
substantially damaged properties as quickly and equitably as possible
after a disaster event. In the first year of this initiative, FEMA is
making Swift Current funds available in four states across four FEMA
regions from which FEMA will be provided learning opportunities to
inform any future iterations of Swift Current.
By law, HMGP is a non-competitive program with funding tied to a
specific state, territory or tribe that receives a major disaster
declaration. Pursuant to regulation the entity receiving the major
disaster declaration establishes the priorities for the funding and
FEMA has limited influence over the types of projects each applicant
prioritizes for federal funding. This places a significant amount of
responsibility on states, locals, tribes, and territories (SLTTs) to
prioritize investments that benefit socially vulnerable populations in
underserved communities. The DRRA increased the amount of HMGP
management costs from 4.89 percent of the total HMGP award to 15
percent whereby 10 percent is designated to the recipient and 5 percent
to the subrecipients. This funding is 100 percent federal funding,
there is no non-federal cost share. This additional funding is for
management costs and is instrumental to subrecipients as it reduces the
financial burden grant development and oversight puts on underserved
communities. For all awarded HMA grants, costs related to the
development of the application prior to the date of the final approval
are identified as pre-award costs and may be eligible for
reimbursement. Pre-award costs may also contribute to the required non-
federal cost share of the award, further assisting financially strained
communities.
HMGP's strategic plan addresses issues of equity and program
delivery to underserved communities. The stated goals of the strategic
plan are to (1) improve program accessibility and enable equitable
outcomes, (2) strategically influence mitigation actions and outcomes,
(3) reduce complexity of the program and enhance state, local, tribal,
and territorial capability and capacity, and (4) improve internal
coordination, capability, and capacity to enhance program effectiveness
and efficiency. Another focus of this equity initiative is exploring
opportunities to partner with private non-profit organizations (PNPs),
charitable foundations, and the private sector to assist sub-applicants
with navigating the grants lifecycle and/ or providing funding to meet
local cost share requirements. Partnering with PNPs and/or the private
sector, could be especially beneficial for rural communities. These
organizations may lend their regional and programmatic expertise to
communities that do not have experience applying for HMA funding nor
the capability to apply for, implement and successfully closeout
mitigation grants. Additionally, these outside organizations or members
of the private sector could help local communities to meet the 25
percent non-federal cost share. A variety of outside organizations have
expressed interest in partnering with FEMA to achieve this goal. FEMA
is currently exploring the possibilities for forming these partnerships
within the current structure of our regulations and statutory
authorities.

Questions from Hon. John Garamendi to Hon. Deanne Criswell,
Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of
Homeland Security

Question 1. Section 70913 of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act (Public Law 117-58) requires the head of each Federal agency to
catalog all federal financial assistance programs administered by the
agency, review existing domestic content preferences, and identify all
``deficient programs'' that do not meet the Buy America policy in the
bill. Yet, despite a January 14th deadline, to my knowledge the
Department of Homeland Security has not submitted this required report.
Has FEMA or DHS completed this report, as is required by BABA/IIJA?
Answer. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-22-
11 ``Initial Implementation Guidance on Application of Buy America
Preference in Federal Financial Infrastructure Programs for
Infrastructure,'' issued April 18, 2022, provided the necessary clarity
on the definition of ``infrastructure project,'' which was needed to
complete the catalog of federal financial assistance programs. FEMA is
working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to identify
the FEMA grant programs that are subject to the Build America Buy
America Act (BABAA) requirements. Once the grant programs have been
identified, DHS will produce the report for all DHS grant programs.

Question 2. Full implementation of Section 70913 will occur on May
14 and this Subcommittee will be keeping a close eye on FEMA's efforts
to comply with the new law. In addition to the identification of
``deficient programs,'' I would like to know what specific efforts FEMA
is undertaking to prepare for BABA implementation across the many
federal financial assistance infrastructure programs it administers?
Question 3. Pre-disaster mitigation programs for infrastructure
hardening provided by FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and
Communities (BRIC) program and mitigation measures authorized FEMA's
Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) are well suited for the
application of these Buy America requirements. Unlike post-disaster
response and recovery spending, pre-disaster projects are undertaken in
non-emergency contexts, in which more careful and long-term planning
are feasible. Thus, they are planned and constructed in the same manner
as traditional infrastructure projects, and the urgency associated with
post-disaster efforts is absent. Can you please detail how FEMA will be
implementing BABA for pre-disaster projects?
Answer to 2 & 3. OMB issued Memorandum M-22-11 on April 18, 2022
which provides, ``Initial Implementation Guidance on Application of Buy
America Preference in Federal Financial Assistance Programs for
Infrastructure.'' FEMA and DHS are currently developing plans to
implement the Buy America requirements in line with the BABAA and OMB
M-22-11.

Question from Hon. Garret Graves to Hon. Deanne Criswell,
Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of
Homeland Security

Question 1. Communities and industry partnerships play an essential
role in emergency management, supplementing federal and state agencies
in times of emergency. Today, I wanted to highlight one of those
partners--Lamar Advertising, based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
In December 2020, FEMA announced an agreement with Lamar to fully
integrate Lamar's digital billboards, nationwide, with IPAWS. With
digital billboards across 43 states, Lamar is well positioned to help
FEMA and state agencies in any type of disaster event.
Digital billboards provide an opportunity to message the public in
real-time and to reach mass audiences quickly and effectively. Lamar's
operations center in Baton Rouge can instantly coordinate their digital
billboards with alerting authorities to display information in affected
geographic regions.
Do you agree that these industry partnerships are valuable in our
collective disaster response, and could you please give me an update on
how FEMA is utilizing the arrangement with Lamar?
Answer. Yes, establishing public private partnerships are an
important tool to assist emergency management in protecting property
and saving lives. The relationship we have established with Lamar
Advertising is just one example of how this partnership enhances public
safety information and elicits public response. Lamar plays generic,
creative (or paid advertisements) on a regular rotation. If a Wireless
Emergency Alert (WEA) is detected for its location, the billboard may
display the WEA content (depending on available/vacant ad space),
within its rotation cycle for a total of 30 minutes. Capable billboards
monitor the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) every
minute for applicable alerts based upon location and event type. In the
past two months alone, Lamar has displayed WEAs distributed by FEMA
nearly 141,000 times on its nationwide network of more than 4,000
digital billboards. Note: The arrangement between IPAWS and Lamar to
display IPAWS WEA alerts on Lamar billboards is non-exclusive. Neither
FEMA nor IPAWS endorses any non-government entities, organizations, or
services.

Questions from Hon. Troy A. Carter to Hon. Deanne Criswell,
Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of
Homeland Security

Question 1. Administrator Criswell, one of the key aspects of FEMAs
2022 plan is ``Instilling Equity as a Foundation of Emergency
Management'' as you know Risk Rating 2.0 went into full effect last
Friday, April 1 despite significant concerns that low- and moderate-
income communities would be priced out of their homes. Do you find it
acceptable or equitable for people's premiums to rise to unaffordable
rates that threaten homeowners to choose between forgoing coverage
completely or being priced out of their homes?
Question 2. Last week, I sent a letter asking for a delay in the
implementation of premium increases for existing policy holders under
Risk Rating 2.0. What is FEMA doing to address the serious concerns
around affordability of flood insurance coverage for lower income
renters and homeowners under Risk Rating 2.0?
Answer to 1 & 2. FEMA recognizes and continues to share your
concerns about flood insurance affordability for many families.
Affordability was a concern under the legacy rating system, and
affordability is a concern under Risk Rating 2.0 (RR 2.0). Currently,
FEMA does not have the statutory authority to consider affordability in
setting rates; however, the Administration has proposed to Congress an
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Flood Insurance Targeted Means-
Tested Assistance program to help low-and moderate-income households
obtain and maintain flood insurance. Such an affordability program
would offer a graduated discount that would scale the benefit to the
policyholder's income. Access to affordable flood insurance would
enable eligible households to obtain financial protection and recover
more quickly and more fully from flood disasters. Expanding NFIP
insurance coverage among historically underserved households would also
contribute to climate resilience by facilitating access to flood
mitigation grants and other resources that require flood insurance as a
condition of eligibility. FEMA look forward to working with Congress on
developing the authorities needed to implement an affordability program
for NFIP.
FEMA implemented phase 2 of RR 2.0 on April 1, 2022, with all
existing policyholders renewing into the new methodology. As of June 1,
2022, over 600,000 policyholders have renewed into RR 2.0, and more
than 20 percent of those policyholders are paying less than they did
under the old methodology. Under the legacy rating system, no
policyholders would have received premium decreases and instead would
be subject to rate increases for an indefinite time.

Question 3. With the increasing frequency and severity of flood
disasters and sea level rise accelerating, which of the issues that
FEMA raised in the RFI are the highest priority for proposing new
implementing regulations? To put it another way, of the issues raised
in the RFI, which would have the greatest benefit to increasing the
resiliency of the nation and the 22,000+ communities who participate in
the National Flood Insurance Program?
Answer. On October 12, 2021, FEMA issued a Request for Information
(RFI) on the NFIP Floodplain Management Standards for Land Management
and Use, and an Assessment of the Program's Impact on Threatened and
Endangered Species and Their Habitats. As part of the RFI, a series of
questions were asked to solicit feedback from the public and
stakeholders.
After the comment period closed on January 27, 2022, FEMA compiled,
analyzed, and summarized all 430 RFI comments received. We received 369
written responses on the eRulemaking portal, 12 additional FEMA and/or
other Federal agency written responses, and 49 verbal responses. Some
responses were one page/one comment, others were 60+ pages and 1,000s
of comments. One of the responses received included a spreadsheet with
13,000 commenters (people)--there were 42 unique comments in that
batch.
So, the 369 written responses received through the eRulemaking
portal, plus the 12 written responses, equals 381 written responses.
Adding the 49 verbal responses to the 381 written responses, we have a
sum of 430 total responses.
FEMA is currently conducting internal working sessions to review
comments and inform decisions about potential changes. Below is a
graphic of the process. Comments similar to this inquiry were received
during the RFI. The agency is working on assessing those comments to
understand how to best align the NFIP with our continued understanding
of risk.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Question 4. Another issue that FEMA raised in the RFI relates to
including future conditions like sea level rise, extreme weather
events, etc. on flood maps. My understanding is that Biggert-Waters,
which was passed in 2012, directed FEMA to include future conditions in
flood maps. How many flood maps has FEMA approved and been adopted by
communities that include future conditions? How many do not?
Answer. The bill directed the Technical Mapping Advisory Council
(TMAC) to provide a report on future conditions mapping and for FEMA to
incorporate the report recommendations into the mapping program.
The initial Future Conditions recommendations to FEMA were made in
2015. They were updated in 2016, and again updated in the latest 2021
TMAC report, which has not been published in its final form.
The TMAC recommendations focused on developing map layers and
advisory products that provided information for decision making. The
TMAC recommended incorporating actionable climate scenarios related to
Relative Sea Level Rise, long-term coastal erosion, impacts to waves
(notably on the Pacific Coast and Great Lakes), and land-use change.
The TMAC also noted a need for consistent methodology and guidance to
integrate future conditions analysis into the FEMA coastal flood
studies and a need to more comprehensively calculate and communicate
the uncertainty in the scenarios.
The TMAC also recommended providing future conditions flood risk
products and information for riverine areas that include the impacts of
land use change, erosion, and climate change as actionable science
becomes available. They noted that efforts to incorporate climate
change impacts into FEMA flood risk products and information should be
based on standardized scenarios defined by authoritative sources of
climate information. Where possible, FEMA should incorporate riverine
erosion hazard areas.
A focus of the TMAC recommendations is to ensure that future
conditions data and information is framed such that it communicates
flood risk messages in a way that more accurately reflect future
hazards and are understandable and actionable by stakeholders.
Below is a summary of FEMA future conditions pilots and relevant
findings.
FEMA Sea Level Rise (SLR) Advisory Map Proof of Concept Study, Puerto
Rico (2010)
FEMA used a 1.3 ft SLR scenario including wave analysis to evaluate
methods for developing SLR advisory data to supplement the Flood
Insurance Study.
SLR Pilot Study, Future Conditions Analysis and Mapping, San Francisco
County, CA (2016)
Evaluated feasibility of incorporating SLR and shoreline change
into analysis and mapping along dune bluff and armored Pacific coast
shorelines.
Advisory SLR Study: Hillsborough and Pinellas Counties, FL (2018)
Evaluated two SLR scenarios and tested a number of ways to
incorporate SLR superposition via modeling and superposition.
Region 1 Long Term Erosion study (2017-2020)
Mapped forecasted erosion over multiple time and SLR scenarios and
maps areas at risk due to future erosion. It included both sandy
shoreline and bluffs. A total of 1000 miles across all states in Region
1 were mapped, and the work included outreach meetings and webinars
with the communities. A web portal is also available. FEMA Region I
Coastal Erosion Hazard Map (arcgis.com)
FEMA has a small number of Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
showing future conditions information. However, most of these were
initiated before the reform bill. The existing FEMA policy was to allow
depiction of future conditions based on expected changes to land use
rather than climate change. The ability to show this information on the
FIRM is tied to local land use regulation, and the information shown on
the FIRM separately from the regulatory Special Flood Hazard Areas
(SFHAs) and Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) determinations. This approach
has significantly limited its implementation.
A key strategy for FEMA is to expand sharing of flood hazard and
flood risk information outside of the regulatory context of the FIRMs.
There is a substantial regulatory framework around the production and
publication of the FIRMs because of the impacts of the regulatory SFHAs
and BFEs on communities and property owners. The regulatory framework
adds significant cost and time to producing the FIRMs in order to
appropriately protect the rights of communities and property owners.
Further, too much non-regulatory information added to the FIRMs may
cause confusion for users and result in costly mistakes in regulatory
compliance.
Based on FEMA's Risk MAP strategy for increased non-regulatory data
sharing and the TMAC recommendations for FEMA to publish future
conditions as an advisory rather than regulatory product, FEMA intends
to make climate based future conditions information available as non-
regulatory products separate from the FIRMs.
Over the past several years FEMA has been working with the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers and others to develop a methodology and
modeling framework that improves analysis of current flood conditions
and allows FEMA to create science based future conditions products.
FEMA is initiating production of these products in Fiscal Year (FY)
2022. FEMA expects these data to be available for the entire East Coast
and Gulf Coast by 2025. These new analyses build on the updated coastal
flood hazard analyses that Risk MAP has been producing over the past 10
years and extend them to support credible, science based future flood
conditions products. FEMA is also developing an inland modeling
framework that will allow for similar future conditions products to be
created for inland areas where actionable data is available.

Question 5. The survivors of Hurricanes Laura and Delta have
experienced more frequent and more impactful natural disasters,
including a severe winter storm and a major flood event in May 2021.
Recently, FEMA issued a notice regarding monthly rent payments for
these survivors that are recipients of the Direct Housing Mission for
Survivors of Hurricanes Laura and Delta. Why has FEMA decided to
collect rent when funding for these survivors is not set to be in the
hands of these communities for several months?
Answer. The Stafford Act authorizes FEMA to provide Temporary
Housing Units (THUs) at no cost to survivors for up to 18-months after
a declared disaster. The period of assistance for THUs in Louisiana was
set to end on February 28, 2022, for FEMA-4559-DR-LA, but at the
request of the state of Louisiana, FEMA extended the period until
October 31, 2022, for FEMA-4559-DR-LA and FEMA-4570-DR-LA. FEMA's
policy, established in the Individual Assistance Policy and Program
Guide (IAPPG), is to charge rent for each month any occupant remains in
a THU during a direct housing extension period. Collecting rent is an
important means of ensuring THU occupants have financial incentives to
achieve permanent housing at the earliest possible time after receiving
temporary housing at no cost during the initial 18-month period of
assistance. This process is designed to ensure FEMA does not impose an
undue hardship on disaster survivors by reducing the amount of rent
based on each household's financial ability. FEMA authorized a
streamlined process for the survivors of Hurricanes Laura and Delta
that ensures economically disadvantaged households receive the greatest
amount of financial relief, while reducing the documentation burden for
all occupants.
FEMA calculates each occupant's monthly rent by applying the HUD
Fair Market Rent (FMR) based on the number of bedrooms in the THU and
the THU location for the FY in which Direct Housing Assistance is
extended. Any occupant who is unable to pay the FMR rate may appeal and
request a lower rent amount based on their financial ability within 60
days of receiving FEMA's notice of the requirement to pay monthly rent.
The streamlined process implemented for DR-4559 and DR-4570
provides the opportunity for survivors to work with FEMA to proactively
provide documentation of their post-disaster income without the need to
appeal. Households whose post-disaster income is less than, or equal
to, the HUD Very Low-Income Limit qualify for a fully reduced rent
amount of $50 per month without having to provide additional
documentation including pre- or post-disaster housing costs.
Households whose income is above the HUD Very Low-Income Limit will
only be required to submit documentation of post-disaster income and
housing costs to calculate their ability to pay rent and determine the
amount of rent that will be charged. FEMA will continue to actively
work with the State of Louisiana to assist each THU occupant in
identifying options, accessing additional financial resources available
from Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery, and
overcoming obstacles to obtain permanent housing.

Questions from Hon. Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon to Hon. Deanne Criswell,
Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Department of
Homeland Security

Question 1. Are there any FEMA funds obligated or allocated to
Puerto Rico at any risk of being clawed back or of being lost because
the work is not done? If so, we would require specifics of which are
most time critical.
Answer. Projects must be completed within the given regulatory
deadlines and any associated project extensions. Any de-obligations of
unspent funds would be tied to the closeout process, which includes a
final reconciliation of costs. Timelines for projects are discussed on
page 196 of PAPPG, v4; while timelines for submittal of projects are
discussed on page 200.
FEMA recognizes the unique challenges in Puerto Rico and continues
to work with the Government of Puerto Rico and FEMA's Central Office of
Recovery, Resiliency and Reconstruction (COR3) to support time
extensions and other requests related to documentation. These practices
help mitigate the risk of de-obligation and are key to moving recovery
forward in a timely and successful manner. The Commonwealth has
demonstrated progress in its recovery projects, which is an important
factor in determining extensions. Each request is considered on a case-
by-case basis. Likewise, FEMA provides ongoing guidance on project
periods of performance to avoid potential de-obligations and help
ensure the recovery is successful.
To validate recovery progress, FEMA is currently conducting site
visits to projects that are under construction across the island.
Reimbursement metrics established by COR3 through its Cash Management
and Payment policies are closely monitored to mitigate risk to
obligations and project completion.

Small Projects:
Question 2. Mayors in towns in Puerto Rico bring up a need for
enabling communities to attend to immediate needs for so-called ``small
projects'' that can be managed through simplified procedures. Today
that is a project under $124,000 which with rising costs is now too
easily exceeded.
Does the agency support HR 5641, the SPEED Recovery Act, recently
passed in the House, that increases to $1 million the threshold for
eligibility for assistance for what qualifies as a small project under
the Stafford Act?
Answer. The Administration has not yet taken a position on H.R.
5641; however, on August 3, 2022, Administrator Deanne Criswell
announced the agency is moving forward in reducing the administrative
burden on government entities and nonprofit organizations receiving
FEMA financial grants following a disaster. In the Spring 2022 Unified
Agenda FEMA provided notice of its intent to issue a regulation in
2022, ``Amendment to the Public Assistance Program's Simplified
Procedures Large Project Threshold'', to update the monetary threshold
for small projects. FEMA has implemented a regulatory change to
increase the small project maximum for the agency's Public Assistance
program to $1 million. FEMA intends that the new threshold will ensure
FEMA and recipients can more efficiently process Public Assistance
Project Worksheets, and an eligibility policy is forthcoming this year.

Power Grid:
Question 3. FEMA has allocated $9.5 billion in Federal Funding for
the rebuilding and upgrading of the Puerto Rico Electric Grid, and is
working with the Department of Energy in the PR100 study to determine
the best way to achieve 100% renewables goal.
Until that happens, we must secure reliable power for homes and
industries NOW. Factions in the Island have demanded that FEMA deny
funding to anything that is not distributed renewables, or even that
Congress should command that.
3.a.  Is it wise to micromanage this from DC, or should that be
subject to Puerto Rico's resources plan, and following the science?
Answer. FEMA obligates Federal funding in compliance with Stafford
Act authority, and accordingly, it is the responsibility of the
Applicant to determine how those funds will be used--here, within the
parameters set forth in the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority's
(PREPA) Integrated Resource Plan. As such, this matter is best managed
by Puerto Rico resource representatives, who have the necessary
expertise and firsthand knowledge on the issue.
In coordination with the Government of Puerto Rico and PREPA,
FEMA's intent is to go beyond simply replacing the power grid.
Transforming Puerto Rico's fragile electric system is the most
significant multi-year project in the island's modern history. An
undertaking of this magnitude takes time. As of June 3, FEMA has
approved funding for more than half of the FEMA Accelerated Awards
Strategy energy projects with scopes of work in its queue--a strong
indicator of progress. While the Agency recognizes the sense of
urgency, the people of Puerto Rico deserve a robust power grid that is
well planned, designed and executed. FEMA has assigned Public
Assistance. Hazard Mitigation and Environmental and Historic
Preservation subject matter experts to fully dedicate their knowledge
to energy projects. As of June 6, 2022, FEMA has fully complied with
the agreed schedule to approve projects as submitted by the Applicant.
FEMA remains committed to supporting Puerto Rico's recovery through
equitable, sustainable, and resilient solutions, working closely with
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to maximize the flexibility of FEMA
funding, including the ability to pursue renewable energy resources, in
accordance with President Biden's Executive Order 14008, Tackling the
Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad. The agency also works with the
Commonwealth help support the island's goals for energy grid recovery
and transformation, by encouraging communities to develop plans that
address long-term risks, such as climate change, and promote resilience
through hazard-resistant design to achieve risk reduction.
FEMA also coordinates with the COR3 to maximize the application of
Section 20601 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123). This
authority allows FEMA to provide restoration assistance to restore
disaster-damaged facilities to an industry standard, without regard to
pre-disaster condition--a flexibility that includes the ability to
pursue renewable energy resources. In addition, FEMA is currently
working with the U.S. Department of Energy and seven of its national
laboratories to evaluate scenarios and pathways to meet Puerto Rico's
renewable energy targets.

3.b.  We just experienced a massive outage in Puerto Rico due to
failure of a transmission system component that was 10 years beyond
design life. The FEMA funding includes over $8 billion for rebuilding
the transmission and distribution grid announced over a year ago but we
still do not have a clear vision of what happens when. One of the
apparent factors in the slow action is a high hesitancy to act without
absolute certainty of FEMA approval.
Is there anything FEMA can do to help accelerate this process?
Answer. FEMA is in a constant forward-leaning engagement with the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and continues to provide a historic level
of support to the Applicant, both financially and in the form of
technical guidance. While FEMA's stewardship of federal funds does
require an approval process timeline, the agency is also continuously
supporting the Commonwealth in the navigation of this process.
For example, through continuous interaction and communication with
the PREPA FEMA is able to clarify documentation requirements and
conditions to help avoid delays and ensure project formulation
processes can move forward. In addition, FEMA is taking proactive steps
to help expedite the recovery. A nearly $600 million project for the
purchasing of materials and equipment that are considered ``long-lead
items'' was recently approved. Since these items take longer than usual
to arrive on the island, the goal is to have the materials in Puerto
Rico so that construction can begin as soon as additional projects are
approved.
FEMA has assigned Public Assistance Hazard Mitigation and
Environmental and Historic Preservation subject matter experts to fully
dedicate their knowledge to energy projects. As of June 6, 2022 FEMA
has fully complied with the agreed schedule to approve projects as
submitted by the Applicant. FEMA Project Delivery Managers (PDMGs)
communicate with PREPA representatives daily to address any concerns
and pending issues. During weekly meetings between FEMA leadership in
Puerto Rico, COR3 and PREPA, priorities are aligned, and recurring
matters are identified and properly managed. It is FEMA's priority to
ensure all parties are provided with the tools to accelerate project
development while complying with the Agency's Environmental and
Historic Preservation (EHP) requirements.

Payments and Chargebacks:
Question 4. When FEMA makes a mistake in granting aid, and reverts
the decision then requires the grant to be given back, how do we deal
with a victim who is unable to pay back, when they may have already
spent the aid to rebuild? Mr. Graves and I are supporting H.R. 539,
pending in the Senate, to prevent that.
What steps is FEMA taking to ensure that decisions on approval of
both public and individual assistance is done both promptly and
accurately?
Answer. FEMA takes several steps to ensure Individual Assistance
(IA) eligibility decisions are prompt and accurate. Most decisions are
made through an automated system based on information provided by the
applicant and damages observed during a FEMA damage assessment of the
applicant's home. These payments are based on automated business rules
and are consistent and timely.
Complex cases and certain types of assistance may require
applicants to submit documentation that is manually reviewed by FEMA
staff. FEMA personnel receive training and have constant access to
guidance to accurately and consistently process applications for
assistance. In addition, FEMA utilizes a platform to provide necessary
updates and clarifications across all IA staff daily.
As part of FEMA's continuous improvement posture, the Agency
implements a full quality-control feedback loop with FEMA staff and
contracted personnel. This process is used to promptly identify and
remediate processing trends and errors as they are identified through
routine analysis and quality oversight. As trends are identified,
information is communicated to processing staff through notification
updates, instructional videos, and group and one-on-one coaching
sessions to mitigate further errors.
FEMA also works to minimize the burden on the applicant in
instances when FEMA identifies an error or improper payment. Per FEMA's
Individual Assistance Program and Policy Guide (IAPPG) and FEMA
Instruction 116-1-2: Individuals and Households Program Recoupment,
FEMA is not required to initiate recoupment actions for debts less than
$250, unless a significant enforcement principle is at stake. Once a
potential debt is identified, FEMA notifies the applicant of the
potential debt and provides them the opportunity to appeal with
additional documentation or information. If the applicant does not
appeal or FEMA is not able to cancel the potential debt based on
information received, the applicant is provided various options for
recoupment including the ability to establish a payment plan, request a
compromise, or request a waiver of the debt. 42 U.S.C. 5174a authorizes
FEMA to waive payments made in error under specific circumstances. FEMA
must review debt waivers based on the individual circumstances and may
waive the debt when:

The covered assistance was distributed based on FEMA
error.

There was no fault on behalf of the debtor.

The collection of the debt would be against equity and
good conscience.

There is no indication that the debt involves fraud, the
presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation by the debtor or
any party having an interest in the claim.

Question 5. As mentioned before, there is a perception in Puerto
Rico recovery that different parties move slowly out of not daring to
act without absolute certainty that FEMA approves and will not change a
decision. Puerto Rico created a Central Office of Recovery, Resiliency
and Reconstruction as a single point for handling FEMA Public
Assistance claims.
5.a.  What has been FEMA's experience working with COR3? With
communicating with community and municipal stakeholders?
5.b.  Can FEMA tell us how does the Puerto Rico situation compare
to others in terms of frequency of changes or reversals of decisions,
including appeals of denials?
Answer to 5.a. & 5.b. FEMA's experience with COR3 has improved over
time. Given multiple changes in FEMA and COR3 leadership during the
last few years, establishing an effective working relationship was
challenging. With permanent leadership from Puerto Rico and living on-
island now at the FEMA Puerto Rico level and at COR3, a more stable
communications structure has been put in place over the last 18 months.
Today, roles and responsibilities are better defined, and priorities
are aligned to help move recovery forward.
As the recipient of all FEMA funding, COR3 works directly with all
sub-applicants, which helps maintain uniformity in guidance and
messaging as well as consistency in implementing procedures, time
extensions, and other requests. COR3 serves as an important link to
hundreds of government agencies and nonprofits by channeling any
emerging issues to FEMA.
FEMA leadership holds meetings with mayors that may have recurring
issues or particularly challenging projects. PDMGs, are assigned to
municipalities and work closely with mayors and other municipal
officials to make sure their projects meet all eligibility criteria. In
addition, through FEMA's Intergovernmental Affairs specialists, mayors
and communities have open lines of communication for any additional
support or technical guidance they may need.
FEMA considers each project from each jurisdiction independently
and provides careful consideration on the project scope and what is
allowable within FEMA's policy and regulations. Thus, comparing
instances of jurisdiction reversals fails to consider the individual
circumstances inherent when reviewing each project. Further, looking
only at reversals ignores the overall number and rate of approvals that
would not be subject to an appeal. FEMA is supporting and has supported
Puerto Rico through thousands of approved projects with billions in
associated funding to facilitate the Commonwealth's recovery.
Nevertheless, when comparing Puerto Rico's appeals to other
jurisdictions, FEMA's initial review indicates they are comparable in
the number of appeals and their relative reversal rates.
GAO Reports:
Question 6. In a report on recovery efforts in Puerto Rico of May
2021, GAO made two recommendations:

That FEMA should, in coordination with the Government of
Puerto Rico and other federal agencies, identify and assess risks to
the remainder of the recovery, including internal and external factors
such as capacity to carry out projects. For example, taking into
consideration if we have the resources to start and finish projects
within a time limit or if more time is needed.

That FEMA should identify potential actions to manage
risks to the remainder of Puerto Rico's recovery and continuously
monitor risks.
6.a.  What has been done to follow up on these recommendations?
6.b.  Is there any way we can help the Agency succeed on this task?
Answer to 6.a. & 6.b. FEMA designed a 3-phase process to identify
and assess risk to the remainder of Puerto Rico's recovery. Phase-1
focused on a) internal environmental scanning to align to Agency risk
framework, b) analysis of internal program delivery operational risks,
and c) risk profiling to include a full risk assessment and development
of proposed mitigation measures. Phase-2 will focus on a) prioritizing
risks based on probability of adverse impact on recovery outcomes while
managing competing requirements, and b) developing joint and achievable
risk mitigation measures in collaboration with the COR3; the latter has
presented to FEMA a set of risks related to program delivery, grants
management and project execution. Phase-3 will focus on a) establishing
the regional risk management governance structure to support this
oversight and b) implementing the risk management plan as a Caribbean
Pilot to ensure Puerto Rico recovery outcomes are achieved.
On May 31, 2022, FEMA Region 2 held a discussion with the
Government Accountability Office (GAO) audit team to clarify their
recommendations for audit GAO 21-264 Puerto Rico and to provide
responses to same. The highlights of that discussion are presented
below:
Our approach to developing a risk management plan and later
implement it as a Caribbean Pilot is based on guidance from the
Agency's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework issued by the
Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO). The Acting DHS Deputy
Secretary has asked, by memo dated April 29, 2019, that each Component
make a commitment to continue to train and develop an ERM capability.
The ERM Framework is recommended by the Risk Management and Compliance
Office, OCFO, and describes a recommended end-state for an effective
and efficient FEMA ERM capability. At all organizational levels, FEMA's
ERM objectives are to:

Increase the likelihood of success in achieving FEMA's
mission and objectives.

Support FEMA leadership through transparency and insight
into risks that could impact the ability to execute FEMA's mission.

Quickly identify both current and emerging risks and
develop plans to respond to risks, as well as to take advantage of
opportunities.

Improve the understanding of interactions and
relationships between risks.

Establish clear accountability and ownership of risk.

Expand the capacity for continuous monitoring and
reporting of risk across the Agency.

Develop a common language (risk lexicon) and consistent
approach to organize risk management activities and inform decision-
making across the Agency.

to the question.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As stated above, the Region designed its risk management planning
efforts on FEMA's ERM prescribed objectives, as laid out in Figure
1.\
\ Since then, however, the timeline for achieving these
objectives has changed based on competing priorities across the FEMA
domains. In addition, the Region's risk management planning efforts
coincided with FEMA's new strategic plan and annual planning guidance,
which have since informed the remaining phases of this effort. Within
the next phases, FEMA will consolidate objectives already achieved and
reassess and realign those that require further collaboration with
internal and external stakeholders. The risk management planning
effort's realignment will be executed as follows:

Phase I--Analyze operational risks, develop risk profile,
and propose mitigation measures in the context of the Agency's new
strategic plan, its annual planning guidance and COR3 identified risks
to recovery as they relate to program delivery, grants management and
project execution.

Phase II--Prioritize risks based on impact to recovery
outcomes, and by September 30, 2022, develop joint mitigation measures
in collaboration with COR3 and other stakeholders. Finalize risk
management Plan by December 2022.

Phase III--Establish the regional risk governance
structure, implement the regional risk management plan as a Caribbean
Pilot focused on achieving Irma/Maria recovery outcomes, and
continuously monitor risk management activities to ensure implemented
risk management options achieve stated goals and objectives. Meeting
these objectives will include but not be limited to:

Identifying and finalizing resources for ERM delivery.

Submitting finalized Risk Assessment Report to GAO (by
December 2022)

Implementing risk mitigation measures in collaboration
with COR3

Training staff to establish a risk management culture
while providing standardized tools to use in managing risks and sharing
risk information.

Focusing tactical activities on metrics and milestones
for recovery operational and project execution success.

Continued Collaboration: In 2021 and 2022, Regional Administrators
(RAs) have met with the PR Governor, his executive leadership, as well
as his Authorized Representative. The focus of discussions has been on
setting priorities for the Puerto Rico recovery. While not yet fully
integrated into the Region's risk management plan, several risk factors
identified early on during the planning efforts have thus far been
mitigated across FEMA domains through joint solutions that have since
positively impacted the largest projects obligated. The commonwealth
has made a significant commitment to execute on over 2,000 PA projects
by end of the Calendar Year.

As part of the risk governance structure, the Puerto Rico
Joint Recovery Office FEMA Officials are the daily point of contact
with the Commonwealth on updates, management alerts and trends on
recovery.

The RA conducts the monthly FEMA Caribbean Executive
Steering Committee that brings together SES leadership and decision
makers from Office of Response and Recovery, PA, Federal Insurance and
Mitigation Administration FIMA, Hazard Mitigation, EHP, OCC, OCFO, and
Grants Program Directorate to discuss the status of recovery efforts
and key issues

LUMA and PREPA, with responsibility for the power
infrastructure, have each provided the region with a five (5) year
outlook plan, identifying estimated construction start dates and
timelines for all projects.

In August 2021, FEMA's Validate As You Go Tiger Team
conducted an assessment of the Commonwealth's internal controls for
payment and cash management through a sampling of executed financial
transactions. The results indicated that the Commonwealth still needs
to remediate issues around compliance with regulations and the document
completeness associated with handling transactions.

As a consequence of the results described above, FEMA conducted
grants management and financial compliance training for both the
Recipient and sub-recipients.
Additionally, over the past six (6) months, the Grants Division in
collaboration with the Recovery and Mitigation Divisions and the
Commonwealth has conducted several trainings and technical assistance
efforts to over 48 municipalities on grants management and effective
project execution to mitigate risks to inappropriate use of financial
assistance and reduce project delivery delays.
Next Steps: With newly appointed executive leadership in place, the
Region is better positioned to define success metrics and evaluate
those against current and future risks. This 3rd quarter, the Region
will focus on working with COR3 and other stakeholders to first
reconcile mitigated risks and further prioritize those remaining risks
and mitigation strategies to project execution. Thereafter, FEMA in
collaboration with COR3 will finalize the risk management plan to be
implemented and monitored throughout Puerto Rico's recovery

Question 7. FEMA's Strategic Plan notes that the future disaster
environment will not resemble that of the past, or even what is
experienced today. To build long-term resilience, communities must
understand their future risk--and have the resources and capacity to
reduce that risk. Accurate cost data specific to facilities and
infrastructure can support effective work planning and budgeting.
Importantly, data must reflect current, dynamic market conditions which
are often driven by the commercial construction market--including
modifications for local building conventions and material logistics
costs.
7.a.  Does FEMA rely on its Cost Estimating Format in its Hazard
Mitigation Assistance (HMA) program?
7.b.  Should FEMA use objective, real-time cost data to use as a
basis for pre-disaster mitigation and resilience construction efforts?
Answer to 7.a. & 7.b. FEMA does generally use objective, real-time
cost data as a basis for pre-disaster mitigation (PDM) and resilience
construction efforts. HMA non disaster and disaster grant programs such
as HMGP, BRIC, FMA, and PDM use a technical review process to evaluate
cost effectiveness and cost reasonableness.
HMA does not require its applicants to use the Cost Estimating
Format as is done in Public Assistance. For HMA programs, applicants
and subapplicants normally generate their own cost estimates in an
Excel spreadsheet template as part of a grant application process.
Subapplicants and their subject matter experts generate estimates based
on their knowledge of local construction and materials costs. The HMA
technical review teams use RS Means and similar national cost
estimating guides; and use FEMA Building Science data to review budgets
and determine reasonable costs. The RS Means updates cost data each
quarter and includes Key Materials and City Cost Index data. The HMA
technical review teams also consider, for example, increased
transportation costs associated with Hawaii or Puerto Rico; and
increased costs driven by shortened building seasons in northern states
like Wisconsin and Minnesota.
The applicant and subapplicant budgets generally reflect current
and dynamic market conditions. 2 CFR 200.404(c) defines reasonable
costs ``as market prices for comparable goods or services for the
geographic area.'' Applicants and sub applicants can also account for
local market fluctuations through contingency costs as described in 2
CFR 200.433(a). HMA grant awards are based on allowable estimated costs
established in a grant application budget.
Large scale disasters, however, often cause disruptions in local
building costs well past the large-scale disaster event. In practice
sustained scarce skilled labor and long-term material supply issues are
not always immediately reflected in RSMeans or FEMA Building Science
Data.

Other Procedural Issues:
Question 8. A complaint we have received is that there are times
when denials of assistance are caused by some incomplete documentation
at an early stage of the process, but that is not notified until after
the denial.
How can we update processes so that when there are necessary
documents missing, they are requested it immediately, instead of
waiting until late in the process?
Answer. In the grant, or project, formulation phase of the FEMA's
PA grant lifecycle, FEMA requires applicants to submit information and
documentation to substantiate the eligibility of a project, to include
the eligibility of the facility, work, and costs claimed. It is the
applicant's responsibility to provide information and documentation to
support its request for federal assistance through the PA program. If
the Applicant does not provide sufficient documentation to support its
claim as eligible, FEMA cannot provide PA funding for the work.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Public Assistance Program and Policy Guide (PAPPG), pages 63-64
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEMA's PA program is designed to continuously improve in order to
achieve the best possible recovery outcomes for applicants. Recently,
FEMA has made process adjustments to deploy liaisons from the
Consolidated Resource Centers to field operations to ensure that field
staff and Applicants have a complete understanding of the process and
the documentation necessary to substantiate claims. In addition, FEMA
is in the process of assessing the PA program with the objective of
simplifying Applicants' experience with the program. FEMA works closely
with stakeholders across state, tribal, territorial, and local
organizations to improve FEMA's grant development process. Examples
include updates to the Grants Manager/Grants Portal online system as
well as PA knowledge tools, such as tutorial videos and guides, to
better clarify to applicants what specific information and
documentation FEMA requires from them. FEMA is also committed to
ensuring communication with applicants throughout the grant development
process is continuous, clear, and transparent to achieve shared goals
of positive recovery outcomes for disaster-impacted communities.
With respect to FEMA's IA, Individuals and Households Program
(IHP), FEMA and applicants communicate by phone through FEMA's IHP
Disaster Assistance Helpline, email, online through
www.disasterassistance.gov, or letters sent through the U.S. Postal
Service. If the applicant requires communication in an alternative
format, such as letters in large print or braille, or they need
assistance understanding any form of FEMA communication, they may
contact FEMA's IHP Disaster Assistance Helpline or visit a Disaster
Recovery Center. All FEMA letters sent to applicants are written in
plain language. Most FEMA letters are automated and issued immediately
following the completion of a FEMA application and after the completion
of a FEMA home inspection.
Two types of FEMA letters assist applicants with notifications on
whether documentation is missing in their file for FEMA to make further
eligibility determinations:
Decision Notifications: Informs the applicant of decisions made on
the types of assistance FEMA has determined they are eligible and/or
ineligible to receive, the reasons an applicant is ineligible for the
applicable types of assistance, and an explanation of the appeals
process to include what documents they may submit to appeal the
decision or amount of assistance received.
Requests for Information: If FEMA requires more information to
process an applicant's request, an applicant may receive a letter
specifically stating what information is needed, as well as document
descriptions or examples of what can be submitted to satisfy the
information request.

FEMA works to identify any missing information as soon as
possible and will alert the applicant so they can provide the necessary
documentation. However, some processes are manual, and FEMA cannot
identify the documents missing until staff have manually reviewed the
applicant's case. Immediately following these reviews, staff will
attempt to contact the applicant by phone to explain what type of
documentation is missing and will send a letter identifying the
documentation needed in order to be considered for that specific form
of assistance. A note is also made in the applicant's case file so that
if the applicant calls back to FEMA's IHP Disaster Assistance Helpline,
any staff can clarify the documentation missing.

FEMA recently made several equity-related changes for
disasters declared after August 23, 2021, that do slightly delay the
process of informing applicants that they must submit documentation to
provide proof of occupancy or ownership of their disaster-impacted
primary residence. However, FEMA uses the time to take additional steps
to verify occupancy and ownership to minimize the number of applicants
that must submit documentation.

FEMA now issues inspections for applicants pending
verifications for occupancy and/or ownership to provide additional
support to them in an effort to verify these requirements at the time
of inspection. Inspectors may view documentation the applicant has on
hand or conduct outreach to landlords, utility companies, and other
entities to confirm occupancy and ownership.

Before requesting documents from applicants, FEMA also
reviews historical disaster assistance data to verify occupancy
(disaster data within the past two years) and ownership (all previous
disaster data) for the same damaged dwelling address.

When neither of these methods are successful, FEMA provides a
denial letter to the applicant, notifying them that they must submit
documentation to prove their occupancy or ownership of their disaster-
impacted primary residence. FEMA also prioritizes outreach efforts by
FEMA caseworkers to contact applicants that continue to be ineligible
due to occupancy or ownership verification to assist them with
navigating the document submission process.
