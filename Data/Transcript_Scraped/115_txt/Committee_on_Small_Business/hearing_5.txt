WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 2017

House of Representatives,
Committee on Small Business,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 11:00 a.m., in Room
2360, Rayburn House Office Building. Hon. Steve Chabot
[chairman of the Committee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Chabot, Luetkemeyer, Brat,
Radewagen, Knight, Kelly, Blum, Comer, Bacon, Fitzpatrick,
Marshall, Velazquez, Evans, Murphy, Lawson, and Adams.
Chairman CHABOT. Good morning. Right on time. The Small
Business Committee will come to order.
And before we get on to any of our important business, we
want to congratulate the gentleman from Mississippi. It happens
to be his birthday today. He is 26, I think, if I am not
mistaken. Something like that. All right. So let's hear it for
him.
Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Where is the cake?
Chairman CHABOT. Yeah, where is the cake? That is right.
So we wish him a great day here today. We wish all of you a
great day.
So I will call the Committee on Small Business Budget Views
and Estimates meeting to order.
Today's order of business is to consider the Views and
Estimates on the priorities of the Committee on Small Business
for fiscal year 2018. And I believe we should be able to get
through this relatively quickly, too.
Since its founding, the United States has relied on small
businesses. We are a nation of creators and inventors and risk
takers. Our economy was structured to be driven by
entrepreneurs and, in fact, most net job growth has been from
small firms. In the past few years, the growing number in
complexity of federal regulations, the healthcare law, and the
tax code have made it increasingly difficult for small
companies to compete and thrive globally, and to keep people
employed locally.
Although the economy is improving, small businesses still
face rough waters. As a result, more small businesses are
dependent on the programs of the SBA, the Small Business
Administration, and it is essential that these programs be
tailored to yield the most efficient and effective results.
The Small Business Administration, or SBA, has a vital role
to play in helping small business owners to expand our economy.
SBA's core functions make capital available, provide training,
and increase the use of small businesses as Federal Government
contractors. However, multiple investigations by the Government
Accountability Office, or GAO, and the SBA Inspector General,
the IG, have revealed an agency that has misplaced priorities
and management deficiencies.
SBA's first responsibility is to complete the task mandated
by Congress before it expends funds on its own untested
initiatives or entrepreneurial training that duplicates
longstanding and proven programs operated by the SBA and its
partners, such as the Small Business Development Centers and
SCORE. SBA's information technology has long been outdated, and
was found by GAO and the SBA IG to be a critical vulnerability.
The Views and Estimates recommend increasing the number of
personnel assisting small government contractors to compete in
the nearly $500 billion federal procurement marketplace. They
recommend establishing a more transparent regulatory process
for SBA's lending partners, strengthening enforcement so only
eligible small businesses participate in SBA programs,
reallocating funds from SBA's own initiatives to the
modernization of SBA's loan management system, and reducing
agency information technology vulnerabilities. The end result
would be a better SBA, one that delivers results for America's
small businesses and for taxpayers.
At this point I will yield to the Ranking Member, Ms.
Velazquez, for any comments she may have on the Committee's
Views and Estimates.
Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Consideration of this year's Views and Estimates comes
before we have a proposed budget to examine. While submission
of this document to the Budget Committee is an important aspect
of the Committee's work, doing so without an actual budget to
inform us is a questionable exercise. In the absence of a
budget, we are making up a broad document that focuses on
improving program functions at the Small Business
Administration. This is consistent with the Committee's
previous work.
As a result, we agree with the chairman on a number of
issues. For example, recommending SBA takes steps to better
manage its capital access, procurement, and entrepreneurial
development programs is prudent governance. Doing so advances
SBA's mission to assist small businesses and better protect
taxpayers. But I just want to make clear, we have to provide
the resources that will enable the Small Business
Administration to do its work. We just cannot come here and
criticize the Small Business Administration for not doing their
job while cutting their budget. We cannot do more with less.
We also agree with the chairman that SBA has repeatedly
failed to properly evaluate its pilot programs. Both the GAO
and this Committee have found that many of these are largely
ineffective and divert resources from proven programs. The
agency's funding of these initiatives, without a specific
authorization, is not in the best interest of taxpayers or
small businesses.
Additionally, we again concur with the chairman that SBA
should strengthen oversight of its lending programs. The agency
is guaranteeing record levels of investment in our small
business community while also reducing loan defaults, but it is
important that loans in the 7(a) and other programs are
targeted to businesses who need it the most, particularly those
that have been unable to secure capital through private
channels. To this point, we must ensure that those businesses
that receive loans truly cannot receive ``credit elsewhere'' as
required under law.
Despite my agreement in so many areas, there is one issue
where the chairman and I do not see eye to eye, and this is in
the area of the Regulatory Flexibility Act which we share
jurisdiction of with the Judiciary Committee. Yes, I am open to
investigating ways to better tailor regulations for the small
business community and reducing compliance costs. However, I
cannot support efforts that will halt broad health, safety, and
environment protections. That said, I look forward to finding
common ground with the chairman in the area of regulatory
policy, as we have done with so many other policy issues.
The success of the American economy depends on small
businesses leading the way, and the SBA is a vital part of this
formula. I thank the chairman for holding this markup and look
forward to continuing our work together to make the SBA an even
better resource for America's small businesses.
With that, I yield back the balance of my time, and I thank
you.
Chairman CHABOT. The gentlelady yields back, and I thank
her for her remarks.
Are there any other members who wish to be recognized for a
statement on the Views and Estimates on the priorities of the
Committee for fiscal year 2018?
Okay. Seeing no members, the Committee now moves to
consideration of the Views and Estimates. The clerk will read
the title of the document.
The CLERK. Views and Estimates of the Committee on Small
Business.
Chairman CHABOT. I ask unanimous consent that the Views and
Estimates be considered as read and open for amendment in its
entirety.
Does any member seek recognition for the purpose of
offering an amendment?
Seeing no amendments, we will move on. And the question is
on adopting the Views and Estimates on the priorities of the
Committee for fiscal year 2018.
All those in favor, say aye.
Those opposed, no.
In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The ayes
have it and the Views and Estimates are agreed to.
I will now recognize the ranking member for the purpose of
making a motion.
Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House rules, I
would like to give notice that the Committee Democrats will be
submitting additional views to the Committee on the budget.
Chairman CHABOT. Thank you.
Without objection, so ordered.
And the Committee is authorized to make technical and
grammatical corrections to the Views and Estimates.
And I believe that concludes the business before the
Committee today. So if there is no other business other than to
wish everybody a very, very merry Trent Kelly birthday today,
we hope you have a great day.
And if there is no further business to come before the
Committee, we are adjourned. Thank you.
