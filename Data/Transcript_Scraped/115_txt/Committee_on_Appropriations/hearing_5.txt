MEMBERS DAY

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES W. DENT

Mr. DENT [presiding]. Good morning. And welcome everybody to today�s
Members Day hearing for Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and
Related Agencies. Chairman Frelinghuysen has en�couraged all
subcommittee chairs to engage in these Members Day hearings so that
we have an opportunity to hear from all of you re�garding the fiscal
year 2018 appropriations process.
As a reminder, be sure to submit any requests for fiscal year 2018
to the Appropriations Committee Member Request Database when it becomes
available. That is more a message to the staff in the room.
At this time I have nothing further to say except I would like to
recognize and acknowledge the ranking member, Ms. Wasserman Schultz,
for any remarks she would like to make.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ

Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome to our
colleagues. I, too, appreciate the opportunity to hear from each of
our colleagues. We all have unique issues related to veterans and the
military and the opportunity to hear from each Member, particularly
those not on Appropriations, is one that al�lows us to really broaden
our perspective as we write and then markup the military construction
and the VA bill.
I know I always appreciate having a chance to go to committees and
talk about my constituents� priorities to those colleagues who
represent those issues every single day, and look forward to hearing
from the Members.
Appreciate the opportunity, and I yield.
Mr. DENT. Well, thank you.
And without objection, your written statements will be entered into
the record. And please feel free to summarize your remarks here within
5 minutes. I should let you know, too, I think we have six members who
are going to be presenting, and so Ms. Radewagen and Mr. Cleaver will
be our first two.
So with that, I would like to recognize the gentlelady from American
Samoa.
