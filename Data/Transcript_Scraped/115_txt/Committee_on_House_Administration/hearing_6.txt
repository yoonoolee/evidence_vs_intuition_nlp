MARKUP ON RESOLUTION TO APPROVE FRANKED MAIL ALLOWANCES FOR COMMITTEES

----------

TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 2017

House of Representatives,
Committee on House Administration,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 11:35 a.m., in Room
1310, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Gregg Harper
[chairman of the Committee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Harper, Davis, Loudermilk, Brady,
and Raskin.
Staff Present: Sean Moran, Staff Director; Kim Betz, Senior
Advisor; Max Engling, Franking Director; Cole Felder, Deputy
General Counsel; Erin McCracken, Communications Director; C.
Maggie Moore, Legislative Clerk; Rob Taggart, Deputy
Legislative Clerk/Oversight; Mary Sue Englund, Director of
Administration & Operations; Jamie Fleet, Minority Staff
Director; Matt Pinkus, Minority Senior Policy Advisor; Khalil
Abboud, Minority Chief Counsel; and Eddie Flaherty, Minority
Chief Clerk.
The Chairman. I call to order the Committee on House
Administration for today's Committee markup. A quorum is
present, so we may proceed.
The meeting record will remain open for 5 legislative days
so Members may submit any materials they wish to be included
therein.
We are here today to formally approve a Committee
Resolution to adopt franked mail allowances for committees for
the 115th Congress.
Each House committee needs a specific amount of resources
to conduct business. The resolution before us authorizes an
allowance of $5,000 per year for each committee's mail, the
same maximum amount that has been authorized for the past
several Congresses.
I believe this is an appropriate level that will meet the
needs of every committee.
I would now like to recognize the Ranking Member, Mr.
Brady, for the purpose of providing an opening statement, if he
wishes.
Mr. Brady. Mr. Chairman, I support this routine resolution,
and I urge its adoption.
The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Brady.
I would ask if any other Member of the Committee wishes to
be recognized for the purpose of providing an opening
statement.
Seeing none, I now call up and lay before the Committee the
resolution to approve franked mail allowances for committees
for the 115th Congress.
Without objection, the first reading of the resolution is
dispensed with, and the resolution is considered read and open
for amendment at any point.
[The resolution follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

The Chairman. Is there any debate?
Are there any Members who want to offer an amendment to the
resolution?
If not, I move the Committee adopt the resolution. The
question is on the motion.
All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
Opposed, say nay.
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and the
motion is agreed to.
Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon
the table.
Without objection, the markup is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:37 a.m., the committee was adjourned.]
