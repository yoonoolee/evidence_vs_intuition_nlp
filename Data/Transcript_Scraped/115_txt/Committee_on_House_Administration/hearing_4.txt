MARKUP OF H. RES. 173

----------

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 8, 2017

House of Representatives,
Committee on House Administration,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:53 a.m., in Room
1310, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Gregg Harper
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Harper, Davis, Smith, Loudermilk,
Brady, and Raskin.
Staff Present: Sean Moran, Staff Director; Kim Betz, Senior
Advisor; Bob Sensenbrenner, General Counsel; Max Engling,
Franking Director; George Hadijski, Director of Member
Services; Erin McCracken, Communications Director; C. Maggie
Moore, Legislative Clerk; Rob Taggard, Deputy Legislative
Clerk/Oversight; Cole Felder, Counsel; Alex Attebery, Staff
Assistant; Jamie Fleet, Minority Staff Director; Matt Pinkus,
Minority Senior Policy Advisor; and Eddie Flaherty, Minority
Chief Clerk.
The Chairman. I now call to order the Committee on House
Administration for today's Committee markup. A quorum is
present. So we may proceed. The meeting record will remain open
for 5 legislative days so Members may submit any materials they
wish to be included therein.
Today we will consider H. Res. 173, the Committee Funding
Resolution which authorizes the committee budgets for the 115th
Congress. Every Congress, the House looks to this Committee to
carry out our responsibility of determining the funding needed
for standing House committees this year and next. Our panel has
received input from the chairmen and ranking members of each
standing committee to help set appropriate funding levels. I
thank each of them for presenting a budget request that is
targeted to meet their legislative and oversight
responsibilities. I am confident that, with their assistance,
our Committee has put forward a funding resolution that applies
appropriate and targeted amounts to effectively support each of
the House committees as they continue their work.
I would now like to recognize the Committee's Ranking
Member, Mr. Brady, for the purpose of providing an opening
statement if he wishes.
Mr. Brady. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for calling
this meeting this morning.
And I am pleased to support the Committee Funding
Resolution. I will ask my colleagues to do same.
I also appreciate your bipartisan approach to this process,
working with me to protect the rights of the minority. On
behalf of my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, the
increase is very much needed, and it will be put to good use. I
hope we are able to take this matter to the floor quickly and
get our colleagues the resources they need.
You know, we hear from every one of our ranking members and
our chairmen, and all they keep saying is they have to get
qualified staff. We need qualified staff all around this
country. And in order to get qualified staff, you have got to
pay them. And we don't pay them nowhere near the level that
they would get paid in private service in the private sector.
So we appreciate, you know, their contribution to the American
people, and we appreciate the contribution to this here. And I
think that most of them--almost all of them--have said that any
increase would be going to staff and getting and keeping
qualified staff, so they don't leave, and being able to attract
qualified staff. So I think it is a good approach that we are
doing a little bit and a little bit more, a little bit more,
and maybe we can maintain and keep that level.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my
time.
The Chairman. The gentleman yields back.
I would ask if any other Member of the Committee wishes to
be recognized for the purpose of providing an opening
statement.
Seeing none, I now call up and lay before the Committee H.
Res. 173, the Committee Funding Resolution.
Without objection, the first reading of the Resolution is
dispensed with, and the Resolution is considered read and open
for amendment at any point.
[The bill follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

The Chairman. Is there any debate?
Are there any Members that want to offer an amendment to
the Resolution?
Seeing none, I move the Committee favorably report H. Res.
173.
The question is on the motion.
All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
Any opposed, by nay.
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it and the
motion is agreed to.
Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon
the table.
Without objection, the markup is adjourned.
Thanks.
[Whereupon, at 10:56 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
