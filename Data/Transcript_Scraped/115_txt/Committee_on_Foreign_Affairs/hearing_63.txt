THURSDAY, JULY 27, 2017

House of Representatives,

Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific,

Committee on Foreign Affairs,

Washington, DC.

The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:15 p.m., in
room 2172 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Ted Yoho
(chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Yoho. The subcommittee will come to order.
Good afternoon, everybody. We have called this markup to
order today to consider four important measures that touch on
pressing challenges the United States faces in the Asia-Pacific
region. After the conclusion of this brief business meeting we
will proceed immediately to our scheduled hearing on the
administration's fiscal year 2018 state and foreign operations
budget request for the East Asia and Pacific region.
Pursuant to notice, we have four bipartisan measures on our
agenda this afternoon. As members were notified yesterday, it
is the intention of the Chair to consider today's business en
bloc so that we can proceed promptly to our hearing. All
members may have 5 days to insert remarks into the record and
without objection, the following measures and amendments will
be considered en bloc: H. Res. 422, urging adherence to the one
country, two systems policy as prescribed in the Joint
Declaration between the Government of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and the Government of the People's Republic of
China on the Question of Hong King; H. Res. 445, honoring the
life and legacy of Liu Xiaobo for his steadfast commitment to
the protection of human rights, political freedoms, free
markets, democratic elections, government accountability, and
peaceful change in the People's Republic of China, and Sherman
Amendment 20 to H. Res. 445; H.R. 2732, the North Korea Travel
Control Act, with Sherman Amendment 21 in the nature of a
substitute to H.R. 2732; and H.R. 3320, to direct the Secretary
of State to develop a strategy to regain observer status for
Taiwan in the World Health Organization, and for other
purposes.
[The information referred to follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mr. Yoho. Before turning to our ranking member, I recognize
myself to speak on today's business.
H. Res. 422, introduced by Ranking Member Engel, will help
draw greater attention to recent developments in Hong Kong
where actions by the Government of China have interfered in
Hong Kong's autonomy and caused the civil liberties--and caused
a chill in civil liberties. The erosion of the one country, two
systems policy threatens to destroy what makes Hong Kong unique
and vibrant, so I commend the ranking member for introducing
this legislation.
Congressman Meadows' H. Res. 445 honoring the life of Liu
Xiaobo is a fitting way for the Congress to pay its respect to
this remarkable proponent of democracy and Nobel Prize winner.
Liu's widow, Liu Xia, remains detained by the agents of the
Chinese Government, raising the same concerns about access to
quality medical care that have been implicated in her husband's
death while he was in prison.
Ranking Member Sherman's amendment will strengthen the
resolution as it relates to Liu Xia. I am proud to support this
amendment as well as the underlying text.
Congressman Schiff's North Korea Travel Control Act will be
an important way for Congress to refine the administration's
recently-announced policy of banning travel to North Korea. I
am looking forward to sending this along to the full committee
with the fixes made by Ranking Member Sherman's substitute
amendment so we can get this important policy right.
Finally, H.R. 3320 responds to Taiwan's disinvitation from
the World Health Assembly this year. U.S. efforts led Taiwan's
inclusion over the last several years. And Taiwan punches above
its weight in the fight against global disease. Unfortunately,
China has taken a short-sighted policy to expel Taiwan from
this forum, and restricts its overall international space.
This legislation will update U.S. law on Taiwan's
participation in the WHO to improve our strategy to promote
Taiwan's place in the world health.
I now recognize our ranking member, Mr. Sherman, for any
remarks he may have.
Mr. Sherman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased that we
have in front of us four excellent bills and that they are
bipartisan, as the work of our committee usually is. I support
all four bills, namely the ones regarding Hong Kong, China,
North Korea, and Taiwan. I am a co-sponsor of all four.
The first bill, H. Res. 422, urges autonomy for Hong Kong
that is consistent with the one country, two systems policy. It
is critical that we send a strong message to China that we
value our relationship with Hong Kong, and that our relations
with the People's Republic will suffer if the PRC seeks to
interfere with the democratic processes in Hong Kong.
The second bill, H. Res. 445, honors the life and legacy of
Liu Xiaobo for his commitment to human rights and political
freedoms in China. Liu received the Nobel Peace prize in 2010.
He died, unfortunately, earlier this month while serving an 11-
year prison sentence, and died in part due to inadequate
medical care.
My amendment to this bill seeks protection for Mrs. Liu
Xia, the widow of Mr. Liu. This amendment urges the United
States Government to continuously advocate for Liu Xia's
release when meeting with Chinese authorities. It arises from
suggestions from our colleague, Congressman Levin.
The third bill is H.R. 2732, the North Korea Travel Control
Act, which requires travel restrictions on travel to North
Korea. This bill is authored by Representative Schiff and Joe
Wilson, and includes provisions that will prevent tourist
travel while allowing limited legitimate travel to North Korea.
I, as you noted in your opening statement, Mr. Chairman,
have an amendment in the nature of a substitute to this bill
that I believe reflects the consensus of the leadership of both
this subcommittee and our full committee.
The State Department has also announced that it will have a
policy to heavily restrict travel to North Korea. The State
Department is correct to restrict travel to North Korea and, in
effect, eliminate tourism to North Korea. However, we should
make it--make sure that aid workers, journalists, NGOs, and
experts are able to travel to North Korea when they can shed,
especially if they can shed light on conditions there. We
should allow travel when circumstances allow.
It is doubtful that we can enact this legislation in time
for so that it goes into effect before the State Department's
restrictions go into effect. So I hope this bill will serve as
a strong statement to the State Department that they need to
make sure in their action, and it will be their action that
will govern at least for awhile, ensure that the humanitarian
relief workers, journalists, and some other limited categories
of travelers, to include people traveling for family reunions,
may travel to North Korea when appropriate.
Finally, the fourth bill, H.R. 3320, asks the Secretary of
State to develop a strategy to regain observer status for
Taiwan in the World Health Organizations. This is important for
world health. You can't exclude a country like Taiwan for
political reasons if you are concerned with fighting disease
that affects people all over the world. Our chairman has also
indicated why this bill is important.
So I would hope that we would ultimately move to adopt my
two amendments and then to pass en bloc all four of these bills
with the support of this subcommittee to the full committee.
And I would yield back.
Mr. Yoho. I thank the ranking member for his comments. We
will next go to Mr. Steve Chabot from Ohio.
Mr. Chabot. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
The measures being considered today are both timely and
important. First of all I would like to speak on H. Res. 422,
urging China to adhere to the one country, two systems policy
with respect to Hong Kong.
The United States-Hong Kong relationship runs deep.
Unfortunately, it has become abundantly clear in recent years
that China is taking systematic steps to limit and restrict the
autonomy of Hong Kong and its people. Less than 2 weeks ago
four legislators were disqualified from serving on Hong Kong's
legislative council, or LegCo. All of these disqualified
members represent new political parties that support greater
autonomy for Hong Kong and self-determination of the city's
future relationship with China.
To add insult to injury, they are expected to pay hundreds
of thousands of dollars in fees for the government's legal
costs. This development to me reeks of China's central
government attempting to purge the LegCo of its pro-democracy
members.
Now, none of this is really surprising. However, it
emphasizes the importance of our support for the original
agreement that was struck between the U.K. and China as it
pertains to Hong Kong. That is exactly why I stand with my
colleagues who worked on H. Res. 422 as we together we want to
ensure that China adheres to the one country, two systems
policy and respects the rights of our brave friends in Hong
Kong.
Lastly, I would like to voice my support for H.R. 3320 I am
also a sponsor of. This bill requires that the State Department
develop a strategy for Taiwan to regain its inclusion in the
World Health Organization. Taiwan is an important contributor
to global health and has provided great research and
development to help combat some of the world's worse diseases.
I believe it would behoove our partners around the world to
give Taiwan a seat at the table at the very least.
I will add that almost 20 years ago I introduced the first
WHO Taiwan resolution, H. J. Res. 126, along with my colleagues
and Representative Sherrod Brown. Not sure whatever happened to
him. He is over in the Senate now.
I have long supported Taiwan's participation at the WHO,
and I am proud to be showing that continued support today.
I would also mention that relative to Taiwan, way back in
the day, my friend and colleague, Mr. Rohrabacher, and I were
the two Republicans who were co-founders of the Congressional
Taiwan Caucus along with two Democrats, one being that, that
other guy from Ohio, Sherrod Brown, that I just mentioned, and
Bob Wexler, Robert Wexler from, from Florida. Florida started
that and here at least the two of us still are.
Mr. Rohrabacher. My, we are getting old.
Mr. Chabot. For those who could not hear it, Mr.
Rohrabacher commented that he and I are both getting old. And
he is right.
Okay, yield back.
Mr. Yoho. I thank the gentleman. I appreciate your
comments.
Mr. Perry, do you have any comments?
Then we will next go and recognize Mr. Joe Wilson from the
great State of South Carolina.
Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Chairman Ted Yoho for your
leadership and for the opportunity to speak before the
committee today on H.R. 2732, the North Korea Travel Control
Act.
When Congressman Adam Schiff and I introduced this
bipartisan legislation in May, Otto Warmbier was still being
held illegally by the tyrannical regime in North Korea. In the
weeks following, a tragedy unfolded. Otto, a UVA student,
returned to the United States but in a coma from which he never
recovered.
Sadly, Otto's story, while tragic, is not unique. Otto was
one of 17 Americans detained by North Korea in the last 10
years. Three are still being held.
I have traveled to North Korea on a congressional
delegation in 2003, led by the former Congressman Curt Weldon,
which had been invited to the city of Pyongyang after Baghdad
had been liberated, getting the attention of the dictator.
While there I saw firsthand how every dollar in North Korea,
including the revenue from tourism, goes toward subjugation of
its citizens and toward the very weapons development program it
uses to threaten American families.
Additionally, the regime also has no reservations about
illegally detained Americans as bargaining chips in an attempt
to score credibility on the world stage. However, despite the
risks and despite knowing how the regime uses tourist revenue,
Western tourism to the regime is increasing, even knowing they
could be incarcerated.
It is time that we enact meaningful restrictions on tourist
travel to totalitarian North Korea. I urge the passage of this
legislation.
I yield back.
Mr. Yoho. Thank you, Mr. Wilson.
The Chair will now recognize Mr. Connolly from Virginia.
Mr. Connolly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thanks to the
ranking member, Mr. Sherman, for bringing these bills to the
subcommittee for its consideration today.
These measures reinforce longstanding U.S. foreign policy
with respect to Taiwan and Hong Kong; protect U.S. citizens
from the risks of travel to North Korea; and honor a giant of
the Chinese human rights movement, who will not be forgotten,
Liu Xiaobo.
I would like to talk in particular about two of the four
measures. I support all four.
H.R. 3320, to direct the Secretary of State to develop a
strategy to regain observer status for Taiwan in the World
Health Organization.
As co-chair of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus I
particularly want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for introducing
H.R. 3320 and for inviting me to be an original co-sponsor of
this bill, which recognizes Taiwan's longstanding participation
in the World Health Organization and works to improve U.S.
strategy for promoting Taiwan's observer status going forward.
Public health should not be a political football. Taiwan's
meaningful participation in the World Health Assembly is in the
best interests not only of the people of Taiwan but of the
entire international community. Taiwan has been a critical
partner in numerous global health issues, including the Ebola
crisis, and the United States should continue its support of
Taiwan's engagement with the World Health Organization and
other international organizations to address global health and
disease prevention needs.
The spread of diseases, especially our concern about
endemic viruses that could cross boundaries in a second, does
not respect political delineations. Taiwan is no different. We
need Taiwan's help and participation in the full international
health community.
The second bill I wanted to address, Mr. Chairman, is H.R.
2732. I also am co-chair of the Korea Caucus and also glad to
be an original co-sponsor of H.R. 2732, the North Korea Travel
Control Act. The North Korean regime's fatal exploitation of a
Virginia student, college student Otto Warmbier, demonstrates
the extreme risks facing any American who visits that rogue
state.
During the past 2 years, Kim Jong Un's regime has arrested
three other Americans, including another Virginian, Kim Dong
Chul, who remain in detention today. This bill protects U.S.
citizens from the risks of travel to North Korea by restricting
travel that would pose an imminent danger to the public health
or the physical safety of United States travelers. The
legislation provides important exceptions for several travel
purposes, including professional reporters, compelling
humanitarian considerations, official U.S. Government travel,
official intergovernmental organizational business, family
reunifications, or other licenses issued by the United States
Treasury Department.
I urge adoption of all four measures before us. I thank the
chair and ranking member for their consideration and support.
Mr. Yoho. Thank you, Mr. Connolly, for the comments.
Hearing no further requests for recognition, the question
occurs on approving the items considered en bloc.
All those in favor, say aye.
All those opposed, no.
Mr. Sherman. Mr. Chairman, a clarification. We are not
only--we are adopting my two amendments and.
Mr. Yoho. Thank you for that clarification.
Mr. Sherman. Thank you.
Mr. Yoho. The question occurs on approving all items
considered en bloc, including all amendments.
And, again, all those in favor, say aye.
All those opposed, no.
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and the
items considered en bloc are agreed to.
Without objection, the measures considered en bloc are
ordered favorably reported to the full committee, as amended,
and the staff is directed to make any technical conforming
changes.
That concludes the markup. The subcommittee stands
adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 2:54 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
