WEDNESDAY, MAY 24, 2017

House of Representatives,

Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere,

Committee on Foreign Affairs,

Washington, DC.

The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 1:09 p.m., in
room 2172, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Ileana Ros-
Lehtinen presiding.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. The subcommittee will come to order.
Pursuant to notice, we meet today to mark up four
bipartisan measures. As members were notified previously, to
ensure that we can move expeditiously to our hearing, we will
consider today's items en bloc.
And so without objection, the following items provided to
your offices earlier this week will be considered en bloc and
are considered as read: House Resolution 201, Expressing
support for the Government of Argentina for its investigation
into the terrorist bombings of the Embassy of Israel in Buenos
Aires on March 17, 1992; Smith amendment, which was worked out
between majority and minority staff last night and this
morning; House Resolution 259, Expressing concern and
condemnation over the political, economic, social, and
humanitarian crisis in Venezuela; the Duncan amendment in the
nature of a substitute to H.R. 259; the Castro amendment--that
is the good Castro--19 to the ANS; the Torres amendment 29 to
the ANS; House Resolution 336, Reaffirming a strong commitment
to the United States-Mexico partnership; H.R. 1918, the
Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act of 2017; and Ros-
Lehtinen amendment 23 to H.R. 1918.
[The information referred to follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Without objection, all members may have 5
days to submit statements and materials for the record.
In the interest of time, I plan to submit my remarks and
Mr. Duncan's remarks for the Congressional Record. I encourage
other members to submit their remarks for the Congressional
Record as well.
And I want to applaud the leadership and help of all of our
congressional subcommittee in bringing attention to all of
these terrible situations throughout the world.
And with that, I would like to turn to Mr. Duncan's ranking
member, Mr. Sires.
Mr. Sires. I have no comments. I agree.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. Thank you very much.
As you know, we have a series of votes on the floor, five
votes. And so I will turn now to the page that does it legally.
Do any other members seek recognition to speak on today's
business?
Seeing no members, the Chair now moves that the
subcommittee favorably report the items considered en bloc to
the full committee as amended.
All those in favor, say aye.
All those opposed, no.
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. The motion
is approved. House resolution 201, 259, 336, and H.R. 1918 are
reported favorably to the full committee as amended.
Without objection, staff is directed to make any technical
or conforming changes.
As you know, all of the members and the staff have been
working for 2 weeks now on this markup, so don't think that
they haven't been read and studied.
The chairman wants to thank all of the members and staff
for their assistance and cooperation on today's markup. And the
subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 1:12 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
