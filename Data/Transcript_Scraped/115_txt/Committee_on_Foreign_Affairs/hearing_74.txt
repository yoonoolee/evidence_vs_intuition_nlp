Chairman Royce. So before placing my prepared statement
into the record I want to briefly highlight one measure here.
H.R. 3329, which amends and strengthens the Hizballah
International Financing Prevention Act, which was signed into
law last Congress. In recent weeks we have seen alarming
reports that Hizballah and Iran are building illicit missile
factories on Israel's doorstep. This, combined with a reported
fourfold increase in Iranian support to Hizballah, is pushing
the region to the brink. We have got to further tighten the
screws on these terrorists.
In addition to the $800 million annual support funding that
they receive from Tehran, Hizballah continues to make millions
from its trafficking in cocaine and other narcotics and in
illicit cigarettes. This bill pushes back against Hizballah's
international financial network, against its Russian and Syrian
enablers, and against its sponsor, Iran. And I want to thank
Ranking Member Engel for working with me on this important
measure.
Without objection my full statement on all nine bills will
be entered for the record, and I now recognize the ranking
member, Mr. Engel.
Mr. Engel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for calling
this markup. I support all of the measures before us this
morning, and I know we are on a tight schedule, so I am going
ask that my statement in its entirety be entered into today's
record.
Chairman Royce. Without objection.
Mr. Engel. Before I yield back I want to recognize
Francisco Marquez, who is with us today, a former political
prisoner of the Maduro Government in Venezuela. He is here to
raise awareness about Congressman Wilmer Azuaje, another
political prisoner. The Congressman has been tortured,
isolated, and denied medical attention, as well as access to
his lawyer and family. Mr. Marquez, we have heard your story
and so many stories like it, and with the bill I introduce with
Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, the Venezuela
Humanitarian Assistance and Defense of Democratic Governance
Act, we are providing humanitarian assistance to the Venezuelan
people and raising the alarm about political prisoners and the
assault on the rule of law.
I also thank Senator Cardin for first offering this
legislation in the other body. So I will leave it there, but
again, I am glad to support all nine measures today. Mr.
Chairman, thank you as always for your leadership, and I yield
back.
Chairman Royce. Thank you, Mr. Engel.
Now, do any other members seek recognition?
Judge Ted Poe.
Mr. Poe. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I support all the
legislation. I also support Mr. Castro's amendment to my bill,
the Foreign Terrorist Organization Passport Revocation bill,
and especially appreciate Mr. Zeldin's legislation as well. And
I ask that all my statements for all bills will be made part of
the record.
Chairman Royce. Without objection.
Mr. Poe. I yield back.
Chairman Royce. Mr. Schneider?
Mr. Schneider. Thank you. And likewise, I commend the
committee for bringing this legislation to markup. I support
this legislation. I have an amendment to the Hizballah
Amendments Act, and I appreciate the support for that, and I
will submit my statement to the record.
Thank you very much.
Chairman Royce. Thank you. Mr. Schneider. Mr. Wilson?
Mr. Wilson. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you and
also the ranking member, Eliot Engel, for the legislation that
we have today, and I have prepared a statement in support,
which I have offered for the record.
Chairman Royce. Thank you, Mr. Wilson. Mr. Sires?
Mr. Sires. I would also like to say thank you to you and
the ranking member for all the hard work. I certainly support
all the bills that are here today, and thank you very much. And
for the sake of time--I appreciate it.
Chairman Royce. Thank you very much, Mr. Sires.
Hearing no further request for recognition the question
occurs on the items considered en bloc.
All those in favor say aye.
All those opposed, no.
In the opinion of the Chair the ayes have it, and the
measures considered en bloc are agreed to. And without
objection the measures considered en bloc are ordered favorably
reported as amended.
Staff is directed to make any technical and any conforming
changes, and the Chair is hereby authorized to seek House
consideration under suspension of the rules.
And that concludes our business for today. I want to thank
Ranking Member Engel and all of our committee members for their
contributions and their assistance with today's markup.
The committee is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 10:10 a.m., the committee was adjourned.]
