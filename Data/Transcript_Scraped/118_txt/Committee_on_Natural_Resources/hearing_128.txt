The Subcommittee on Federal Lands will hold an oversight hearing on
``Examining the President's FY 2025 Budget Request for the U.S. Forest
Service'' on Tuesday, June 4, 2024, at 10:15 a.m. in room 1324
Longworth House Office Building.

Member offices are requested to notify Will Rodriguez

their Member intends to participate in the hearing.

I. KEY MESSAGES

Despite receiving billions of dollars in recent years, the
U.S. Forest Service (USFS) is still struggling to confront
the myriad challenges facing the agency, most notably the
historic wildfire crisis that has destroyed lives and
property, degraded air and water quality, and irreparably
damaged millions of acres of wildlife habitat.

The USFS budget once again fails to address systemic
impediments to addressing the wildfire crisis, while
seeking significant increases in funding. Burdensome
regulations and frivolous litigation remain the primary
obstacles blocking better forest management outcomes.

This hearing will provide an opportunity to hold the USFS
accountable and get answers on the agency's plans to
confront our nation's wildfire crisis, increase timber
production, improve forest health, reduce the deferred
maintenance backlog, and address the effects of Biden's
border security failures on our nation's forests.

II. WITNESSES

Mr. Randy Moore, Chief, U.S. Forest Service, U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC.

III. BACKGROUND

Budget Overview--Chief Randy Moore will be appearing before the
Subcommittee on Federal Lands to discuss the Biden administration's
fiscal year (FY) 2025 budget request for the U.S. Forest Service
(USFS). The USFS's FY 2025 budget requests $8.9 billion in
discretionary funding (including roughly $2.4 billion for the Wildfire
Suppression Operations Reserve Fund), which reflects a $658 million
increase over FY 2024 enacted levels.\1\ The USFS manages 193 million
acres of National Forest System (NFS) lands, including 154 National
Forests and 20 National Grasslands across 9 USFS Regions.\2\ Most of
these lands are located in our western states. The USFS manages more
federal land in the eastern United States than all the other land
management agencies combined.\3\ Under the Multiple Use and Sustained
Yield Act, NFS lands are to be managed for timber production, outdoor
recreation, energy and mineral development, livestock grazing,
watershed protection, and wildlife habitat.\4\ Every year, NFS lands
host roughly 159 million visitors, contributing about $15.2 billion to
the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\5\

Wildfire Crisis--Since 2000, over 164 million acres have been
damaged by wildfire in the U.S., a collective area that is roughly
three times the size of the entire state of Utah.\6\ Prior to 2015, the
United States never had more than 10 million acres burn in a single
wildfire season. In the past decade, however, the country has now hit
that ominous mark three times during the worst wildfire seasons on
record (2015, 2017, and 2020).\7\ This crisis has wreaked havoc on
landscapes and communities across the western United States.
Catastrophic wildfires destroyed lives and property, degraded air and
water quality, and irreparably damaged millions of acres of wildlife
habitat. This year, more than 1.86 million acres have burned, largely
in Texas and Oklahoma during February wildfires.\8\ Historically, the
USFS has carried out only 2 million acres of treatments per year.\9\ At
this disappointing rate, it would take the USFS over 30 years to treat
the estimated 63 million acres of NFS land at risk for wildfire.\10\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite receiving roughly $11.5 billion from the Inflation
Reduction Act (IRA) and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA),
the USFS has failed to meaningfully ramp up the number of acres
treated.\11\ In fact, for the second year in a row, the USFS budget
proposes treating fewer acres than the year prior. The FY 2025 budget
seeks $207 million for hazardous fuels reduction, consistent with the
FY 2024 enacted amount.\12\ Although the request for funding is
constant, the USFS treatment goal for FY 2025 is 4 million acres, or
200,000 acres less than the previous year's target.\13\ This puts the
agency off by roughly 2 million acres from their own estimates
regarding how much land needs to be treated in the 10-year
``Confronting the Wildfire Crisis'' Strategy.\14\

Even this lackluster target is likely inflated, though, as the
budget fails to address investigative reporting that uncovered the USFS
has overstated its treatment numbers by more than 20 percent.\15\ The
discrepancy stems from the USFS recording multiple treatments (i.e.,
mechanical thinning, prescribed burning, chipping and piling, etc.) on
the same acre separately as if multiple acres had been treated.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The House Committee on Natural Resources has advanced legislation
to address inaccurate reporting of treated acres by USFS. H.R. 1567,
introduced by Subcommittee on Federal Lands Chairman Tom Tiffany (R-
WI), requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department
of the Interior to submit accurate reports regarding hazardous fuels
reduction activity and implement standardized procedures for tracking
data related to such activities. The legislation was reported by the
Committee on Natural Resources by unanimous consent on April 28, 2023,
and was passed by the House of Representatives by a vote of 406 to 4 on
September 13, 2023.

Wildland Fire Management--As wildfire seasons have grown in both
length and severity, so too have wildland fire management costs. In the
last decade, suppression costs averaged over $3 billion per year across
the federal land management agencies.\16\ The FY 2025 budget proposes
$2.6 billion for Wildland Fire Management activities, an increase of
$433 million from the FY 2024 enacted level.\17\ Unfortunately, the FY
2025 budget proposes shifting more than half of that total--
approximately $1.3 billion designated for wildfire pre-suppression and
suppression activities and firefighter salaries--from base
discretionary to emergency funding.\18\ In so doing, the FY 2025 budget
would free up base discretionary funding for pet projects of the Biden
Administration, including the purchase of zero-emission vehicles and
associated charging infrastructure.\19\ This budgetary gimmick would
divert funding from necessary wildfire management activities and
appears to be an attempted evasion of effective congressional oversight
and responsible budgeting practices.

Timber Targets--The USFS failed to hit its timber target in FY 2024
by roughly 260 million board feet, selling only 3.143 billion board
feet (BBF).\20\ Concerningly, the USFS lowered its timber target from
3.4 BBF to 3.2 BBF for the next two years.\21\ This troubling
trajectory for treatment and timber targets casts doubt on the USFS's
wildfire risk reduction efforts and reflects an ongoing threat to
sawmill infrastructure. Since 2000, over 1,500 sawmills, or roughly
one-third of the total number of sawmills in operation at that time,
have closed or curtailed capacity.\22\ The loss of this critically
important infrastructure and mill capacity greatly hampers efforts to
process hazardous fuels, thus exacerbating the wildfire crisis. A lack
of reliable federal timber is consistently cited as a primary cause
behind numerous mill closures in western states with large amounts of
federal land. Just last month, in April 2024, C&D Lumber, which began
operations in southern Oregon in 1890, announced its permanent closure,
citing ``timber supply issues'' among other challenges, that ``have
made it impossible for us to envision a sustainable future for the
company.'' \23\

Without a stable supply of timber, investments in new sawmills,
which often cost more than $100 million, make little sense for private
industry.\24\ The FY 2025 Budget includes $43 million to support Forest
Products, and the USFS has continued to emphasize its support to expand
markets for through Wood Innovations grants. Last year, USFS used $48
million to fund 104 Wood Innovations projects focused on expanding wood
products and markets.\25\ While innovative uses for wood products are
an important pursuit, they are not a replacement for the Forest
Service's need to do a better job harvesting timber resources to meet
the market's current demands.

Wildfire Prevention Studies--Despite heightened federal
expenditures on suppression activities, wildfires continue to increase
in size and severity across the U.S.\26\ Investments in wildfire
prevention, including through scientific studies of at-risk landscapes,
are a crucial step toward addressing the growing crisis.\27\
Unfortunately, the USFS FY 2025 budget request, while proposing
significant funding increases for other budget items, misses
opportunities to sustain needed prevention efforts. The Joint Fire
Science Program (JFSP), for example, ``provides funding and science
delivery for scientific studies associated with managing wildland fire,
fuels, and fire-impacted ecosystems to respond to emerging needs of
wildland fire and land managers, practitioners, and policymakers from
local to national levels.'' \28\ As such, the JFSP aims to function as
a ``primary clearinghouse'' for cutting-edge ``fire science information
and activities throughout the nation.'' \29\ Although this program
promises many prevention-related benefits, the USFS proposes to cut
funding for the JFSP for FY 2025.\30\

State, Private, and Tribal Forestry--Wildfires do not respect
manmade boundaries, so collaboration with states, tribes, local
communities, and other stakeholders is critical. The State, Private,
and Tribal Forestry organization within the USFS facilitates much of
this cross-boundary work.\31\ This organization provides resources and
assistance to non-federal stakeholders, focusing on improving forest
health and protecting communities from wildfires.\32\ The FY 2025
budget decreases that account by roughly $32 million, dropping by $305
million below FY 2024.\33\

Reforestation--In addition to addressing existing wildfire threats,
there is a clear need to restore previous landscapes damaged by
wildfire. In the last 20 years, the United States lost an average of 7
million acres per year to catastrophic wildfires, more than double the
average seen during the 1990's.\34\ Many of these catastrophic
wildfires burn so severely that natural regeneration is impossible. If
these lands are not artificially regenerated (i.e., by planting trees),
the lands will eventually transition from forests to shrublands. In
total, the USFS identified a 4 million-acre reforestation backlog, 80
percent of which is related to catastrophic wildfires.\35\
Unfortunately, the agency has only addressed less than 6 percent of its
post-wildfire planting needs annually.\36\ The IIJA removed the $30
million cap on the Reforestation Trust Fund (RTF), which receives funds
from the collection of tariffs on certain wood-product imports to fund
reforestation efforts on public lands.\37\ The USFS budget notes that
collections decreased to $158 million from $261 million in FY 2024.\38\
The budget seeks $140 million to increase ``organizational capacity in
nursery, genetics, and reforestation programs.'' \39\

Even though the USFS is requesting additional money for
reforestation, the agency's reforested acreage target is lowered in the
FY 2025 budget. The USFS aims to complete roughly 1.8 million acres of
reforestation over the next 10 years.\40\ Despite the considerable
increase in funding through the RTF, this reforestation goal is a
decrease from before the cap was removed when the agency was averaging
reforestation on 190,000 acres annually.\41\ More needs to be done to
address the estimated 4-million-acre reforestation backlog.\42\
Further, while reforestation is an important component of healthy
forest management, failing to properly thin and manage forests and
utilize wood products will mean that replanted trees will add fuel to
future wildfires.

Wildland Firefighter Pay--The IIJA provided $600 million to
increase the base firefighter salary by $20,000 (or 50 percent of their
current salary, whichever is lesser).\43\ Under the IIJA, $480 million
of this increase was for the USFS wildland firefighters, while $120
million was for the Department of the Interior (DOI).\44\ Congress has
extended this pay increase four times, and the current extension will
last through the end of FY 2024.\45\ To address wildland firefighter
pay, the USFS FY 2025 budget includes $2.6 billion for Wildland Fire
Management Activities, a $433 million increase from the FY 2024
level.\46\ The budget also includes $216 million for a permanent pay
increase for wildland firefighters.\47\ An increase of $69 million is
requested for cost of living adjustments, and $136 million to increase
Federal firefighting capacity.\48\ Finally, this budget seeks a $10
million investment to support health and wellbeing services for
wildland firefighters.\49\

Brave wildland firefighters, who routinely put their safety and
lives on the line to protect vulnerable communities, undoubtedly
deserve fair compensation. Unfortunately, the USFS has consistently
failed to transparently account for salaries and expenses, complicating
this issue. The FY 2025 budget fails once again to identify an offset
for any pay increases and suggests in numerous instances that the
agency may not even have enough money to pay normal salaries. For
example, the budget frequently states: ``The Forest Service will need
to rely on other funding sources for Salaries and Expenses and balance
hiring actions and attrition rates to stay within appropriations in the
operational year.'' \50\ The budget does not provide any further
analysis to accompany this vague statement, causing confusion about
whether the agency may need to request supplemental funds to continue
normal operations. This curious lack of detail compounds previous
concerns raised by Congress that the USFS had inaccurately asserted
wildland firefighters would face a pay cut when the agency had over
$100 million remaining to pay firefighter salaries.\51\

Old Growth and Mature Forests--In April 2022, President Biden
issued Executive Order 14072, directing the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) and DOI to define, identify, and inventory ``mature
and old growth forests'' on public lands and subsequently develop
policies to protect those forests.\52\ The interagency mature and old
growth initiative began in July 2022 with a Federal Register Notice and
public comment period, resulting in roughly 4,000 comments and more
than 100,000 signatures on various form letters from across the
country.\53\ In April 2023, the USFS published an ``initial draft''
seeking to define and inventory ``old-growth and mature forests'' and
even convened a ``Definition Development Team.'' \54\ Yet all these
efforts have failed to create a single, coherent definition for ``old-
growth'' or ``mature'' forests. This is a predictable shortcoming, as
no standard definition exists for ``old-growth forests'' and ``mature
forests,'' and they are not terms recognized in the scientific practice
of forestry. Despite this lack of clear definitions, the report
identified 91 million acres of ``old-growth and mature'' forested lands
on NFS lands, comprising 63 percent of all land managed by the
USFS.\55\

The Biden administration ultimately admitted that ``these
`definitions' are considered dynamic, not static, and thus are subject
to refinement as new information is incorporated (working
definitions).'' \56\ Despite lacking a real definition, the
administration released an introductory report in January that
identified wildfire, insects, and diseases as the leading threats to
mature and old-growth forests and even admitted that ``tree cutting''
is a minor threat that generally ``improved or maintained'' the stands
that had been managed.\57\ Continuing this misguided and incomplete
effort, the USFS published a Notice of Intent to amend all 128 national
forest land management plans to provide direction on how to manage,
conserve, and steward old-growth forest conditions.\58\ A draft
Environmental Impact Statement is expected this summer, and the
amendment process is expected to be completed in early 2025.\59\ This
misguided effort has unquestionably diverted time and energy away from
addressing the overwhelming wildfire crisis that is the true threat to
forest stands of every age class. This forest plan amendment process to
protect so-called ``old growth forests'' poses serious threats to
forest health and multiple use management. Committee Republicans are
continuing to fight against this unnecessary and unhelpful endeavor.

30x30 Initiative and Locking Up Lands--The Biden administration
continues to conduct orchestrated attacks on public lands, using a
variety of tools to further the 30x30 agenda. These preservationist
policies limit access, hurt local economies, and remove uses of public
lands that benefit Americans. The Biden budget continues to support the
30x30 Initiative, including through several references in the USFS
budget.\60\ On May 6, 2021, the USDA and other federal departments
released an ``interim'' report titled ``Conserving and Restoring
America the Beautiful,'' which outlined a 10-year campaign to preserve
30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030.\61\ In this report, the
administration proposed an American Conservation and Stewardship Atlas.
Nearly three years later, the administration finally published this
atlas, even though the USFS has already been implementing 30x30 without
clear goals or definitions and in whatever manner it considers
convenient on any given day.\62\ For instance, the decision to lock-up
roughly 16.7 million acres under roadless restrictions in the Tongass
National Forest in Alaska has been highlighted as an advancement for
30x30. Likewise, the misguided 225,000-acre mineral withdrawal in the
Superior National Forest in Minnesota was touted as a win for the so-
called ``America the Beautiful Initiative.'' These measures continually
threaten working lands, private landowners, and multiple uses of land.

Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA)--Since the passage of the GAOA
in 2020, the USFS received up to $285 million from the National Parks
and Public Lands Legacy Restoration Fund (LRF) each year to address the
deferred maintenance backlog.\63\ Despite this significant investment,
the USFS's deferred maintenance backlog increased from $5.22 billion in
FY 2019 to over $7.66 billion in FY 2022.\64\ While this increase is
not as large as those experienced by agencies like the National Park
Service, it still represents an astonishing 47 percent increase over a
relatively short period. The FY 2025 budget requests $285 million for
89 LRF projects. Of this amount, $33.86 million is for administrative
and contingency funds, which will do nothing to reduce the maintenance
backlog.\65\

The FY 2025 budget request also includes $218 million for the Land

land acquisition and $94.2 million for the Forest Legacy Program.\66\
Last year, the USFS acquired over 46,000 acres of land.\67\ Despite
this permanent and mandatory funding stream, the discretionary USFS
budget continues to carry a specific line item for land acquisition
above LWCF funding. Adding new acres to the federal estate for the USFS
to manage while the agency's deferred maintenance backlog steadily
rises will only exacerbate existing maintenance challenges.

Biden Border Crisis--The Biden Border Crisis is harming USFS lands,
primarily through the illegal cultivation of narcotics on USFS lands by
drug cartels. The USFS reported that 5,801 illegal cannabis cultivation
sites were detected on NFS lands during the 2011-2022 period.\68\ While
data is limited, the USFS estimated that it had removed 381,510 pounds
of trash, 479 miles of plastic irrigation lines, and 228 containers of
banned and illegal pesticides from these illegal cultivation sites over
a roughly 20-year period.\69\ This illegal cultivation also sparked
wildfires that burned over 265,000 acres.\70\ The USFS estimated that
illegal marijuana cultivation on National Forest System lands earns
cartels an estimated $56 million to $91 million annually.\71\ Even the
USFS's own budget documents acknowledge that the agency has
historically been ``underestimating the threat of this activity on
Federal public lands'' and only capturing a mere fraction of the
illicit activity occurring on NFS lands.\72\ For example, the USFS used
new technology to survey a mere four percent of three National Forests
and found 136 cultivation sites.\73\ Of these sites, 77 had gone
completely undetected over the previous 20 years.\74\ Despite the
promise of this new technology, the budget does not specifically ask
for any related increases to address President Biden's border crisis.
In fact, the only increases related to border enforcement are for
updated vehicles. With each officer of the USFS's Law Enforcement and
Investigations program patrolling, on average, a sprawling 370,000
acres of NFS lands,\75\ investments in enforcement technology and
personnel are sorely needed.

OVERSIGHT HEARING ON EXAMINING THE PRESIDENT'S FY 2025 BUDGET REQUEST
FOR THE U.S. FOREST SERVICE

----------

Tuesday, June 4, 2024

U.S. House of Representatives

Subcommittee on Federal Lands

Committee on Natural Resources

Washington, DC

----------

The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:15 a.m. in
Room 1324, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Tom Tiffany
[Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Tiffany, McClintock, Fulcher,
Stauber, Curtis, Bentz, Westerman; Kamlager-Dove, and Leger
Fernandez.
Also present: Representatives LaMalfa; and Stansbury.

Mr. Tiffany. The Subcommittee on Federal Lands will come to
order.
Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a
recess of the Subcommittee at any time.
The Subcommittee is meeting today to hear testimony on the
President's Fiscal Year 2025 budget request for the U.S. Forest
Service.
I ask unanimous consent that the following Members be
allowed to participate in today's hearing from the dais: the
gentleman from California, Mr. LaMalfa.
Without objection, so ordered.
Under Committee Rule 4(f), any oral opening statements at
hearings are limited to the Chairman and the Ranking Minority
Member. I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that all other
Members' opening statements be made part of the hearing record
if they are submitted in accordance with Committee Rule 3(o).
Without objection, so ordered.
I now recognize myself for an opening statement.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. TOM TIFFANY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN

Mr. Tiffany. I would like to begin by welcoming Chief Moore
back before the Subcommittee. Chief Moore, it is good to have
you here again. We appreciate you taking the time to answer our
questions on your agency's Fiscal Year 2025 budget request.
Improving the health of our nation's forests and combating
the devastating wildfire crisis are some of the most pressing
issues before this Committee. The scale of this challenge is
immense and cannot be overstated. For far too long communities,
particularly those out West, have had to bear the brunt of
catastrophic wildfire for years with seemingly no end in sight.
Unfortunately, the Forest Service's Fiscal Year 2025 budget
fails to rise to meet this challenge.
Due to reckless Democratic spending during the previous
Congress, the Forest Service received roughly $11.5 billion in
supplemental funding. This funding was touted as transformative
and the only tool the agency needed to increase the pace and
scale of forest management. Years later, it is hard to see any
difference this funding has made on the ground.
For the second year in a row, the Forest Service budget
proposes treating fewer acres than the year before, with a
target of 4 million acres treated. Based on the agency's own
estimates, this puts the Forest Service roughly 2 million acres
behind the goals they laid out in the 10-year wildlife crisis
strategy.
As we know from previous investigative reporting and
Committee oversight, these numbers are still likely inflated
due to Forest Service's policies of counting acres treated more
than once. I am happy that my bipartisan ACRES Act passed the
House last year, and I hope the Senate can consider this
legislation quickly. However, I am still disappointed that this
issue even requires legislation to fix.
Chief Moore, the American people deserve transparency and
accountability, and I would strongly encourage your agency to
improve the quality of this data.
Concerningly, the number of acres treated is not the only
Forest Service target that is being missed. Last year, the
Forest Service also fell short of its timber harvest targets by
roughly 260 million acres. And once again, this budget has
lowered the timber targets from 3.4 billion board feet to 3.2
billion board feet for the next 2 years.
[Chart.]
Mr. Tiffany. Throughout this Congress I have often shown
the chart behind me, which demonstrates the relationship
between failing to harvest timber and catastrophic wildfires.
There is a direct relationship between our continuing failure
to harvest timber and the historically catastrophic wildfire
years we are experiencing. It is therefore deeply troubling
that, instead of attempting to remedy the shortcomings of
failing to meet the agency's target this year, the Forest
Service has apparently chosen to lower its timber target by 400
million board feet.
This is not walking down the right path to forest
restoration. We have heard from our land managers, including
Chief Moore, about the need for a paradigm shift in the way we
manage our forests. I agree. But it continues to be abundantly
clear that funding alone will not deliver this shift, and we
must address the regulatory and litigation obstacles that
continue to impede management efforts.
This budget once again seeks more funding to do less
management, while also failing to offer any reforms to address
long-standing barriers to forest management. I am rightfully
skeptical.
While I have concerns with this proposed budget, I do
recognize the enormous challenges facing the Forest Service,
and hope that we can discuss ways to bring about the changes to
see better results. There is broad agreement on the need to
turn the tide against this wildfire crisis and restore health
and resiliency to our ailing forests.
We also know that we need to aggressively suppress
wildfires threatening our communities, take care of our brave
wildland firefighters in a fiscally responsible manner, and
support our local forest products industry.
I want to once again thank Chief Randy Moore for being here
today.
We are committed to working with you and your agency on
these solutions, and we look forward to hearing more from you
today.
With that, I now yield back and recognize Ranking Member
Kamlager-Dove for her opening statement.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. SYDNEY KAMLAGER-DOVE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Thank you, Chair Tiffany and Chief
Moore.
You are back before us again in the Federal Lands
Subcommittee, and I look forward to the conversation today.
Your time is valuable. We know this. And as we enter this
year's fire season, I would like to offer my sincere gratitude
for the work that you and your agency do each and every day,
especially for Californians and Angelenos.
The Forest Service is charged with sustaining the health,
diversity, and productivity of the nation's forests and
grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations.
That is no small task, as the nation's forests and grasslands
make up 193 million acres nationwide. And last month was the
hottest May on record and the 12th consecutive month to claim
that title. Let me repeat that: 12 straight months of record
highs. A full calendar of record busting temperatures, and not
just in the House Oversight Committee. This is unprecedented,
and should be indisputable affirmation that climate change is
affecting our public lands.
Such drastic climate changes make the work of the Forest
Service ever more complex and essential as fire seasons rage
longer, drought intensifies, and our forests face considerable
resiliency obstacles. So, it would make sense to me that we
would be aiming to meet the Forest Service's budget requests,
fully fund their vital mitigation and response accounts,
amplify the innovative work being done to modernize forest
products, and ensure that the agency has significant support
for staffing and capacity challenges. After all, that is how
you help government work.
Unfortunately, we have continued to see a cycle of chronic
and unsustainable underfunding for the agency, underfunding and
then blame gaming. In fact, just a few months ago the Chief
warned us that lower appropriated funds, required cost-of-
living adjustments, and inflated costs of operation are leading
to funding gaps in salaries and other internal services among
the Forest Service. We must listen to our agency leaders when
they express such significant concerns.
Democrats delivered with monumental investments from the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act,
which have certainly helped. I know that the firefighter pay
increase from the infrastructure law has been an important
hiring and retention tool for the Forest Service, and I am
pleased to see $216 million in the Fiscal Year 2025 budget to
continue this initiative, one which we must make permanent.
Despite the gains from these investments, the Forest
Service still faces vacancies in fire-related positions and
general staffing gaps in non-fire positions. Such gaps directly
tie to project delays and management challenges across the
agency that my Republican counterparts often attribute to the
legal burdens of environmental review.
However, we know that reviewing, permitting, and project
management activities require staff capacity more than anything
to execute the tools we have already granted the Forest
Service, tools such as the 12 new authorities Congress has
passed in the last 10 years meant to reduce the permitting
process or the role of judicial review in the project approval
proposal.
The Forest Service doesn't need new authority or additional
waivers of our bedrock environmental laws. It needs sustainable
funding and additional staff capacity. It is promising to see a
prioritization from the Biden administration to address
staffing challenges across the agency to support a growing
demand for outdoor recreation, restoration projects aimed at
adapting to a changing climate, protection of cultural
resources, and providing clean water resources nationwide.
Chief Moore, I look forward to hearing from you and
listening to our discussion today. I hope that my colleagues
and I can work together to support a beneficial and strong
Forest Service budget for Fiscal Year 2025.
With that, I yield back.

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Representative Kamlager-Dove. Now,
I am going to recognize the Chairman of the Full Committee, Mr.
Westerman, if he is ready for his opening statement.
Sir, are you prepared?
Mr. Westerman. Always prepared, Mr. Chairman.
[Laughter.]

STATEMENT OF THE HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS

Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chief Moore, thank you for being here today. It has been
good to work with you and visit with you and to understand the
challenges that forestry and America face, and I know you are
on the front lines of that. It is something I am very
passionate about. But as we look at the budget request from
this year and we see the increase, I think you can understand
why we have some heartburn when you look at the history of the
funding that we have sent to the Forest Service.
When I first came to Congress, the big issue was fire
funding. And we did the fire funding fix. And then we did the
Great American Outdoors Act, and included the Forest Service in
the Great American Outdoors Act. There was the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law of 2021 that gave more money to the Forest
Service. I did not vote for that one. I did not vote for the
Inflation Reduction Act. But all of those bills put more
funding into the Forest Service. And it doesn't appear that
anything is getting better with the health of our forests
across the country.
And I know you face a lot of challenges, and a lot of that
is because of Congress, and because we have failed to give you
the tools and the authorities to be able to go in and do the
work that you need to do. And we are in a situation now that
you and I have discussed, where it is kind of a triage mode.
There are a limited number of resources, there are a limited
number of people who can do management. And the areas that seem
most critical to protect are those wildland-urban interfaces,
their transportation corridors, transmission corridors,
watersheds.
And it is almost like, I will use the term ``the troops,''
that are out there to manage the forests are retreating back to
these areas and trying to create the last defense against
catastrophic wildfire, and this is something that has come
about because of years of not being able to manage the rest of
the forests. And we know that to be able to manage forests, we
have to have markets for the products.
Mr. McClintock has had success in passing legislation that
has been very beneficial down around South Lake Tahoe in doing
management that has stopped wildfire, yet there are hardly any
markets for those products that come off, and it ends up
costing the taxpayer a thousand to a couple thousand dollars an
acre to be able to go in and manage the forests simply because
the mill infrastructure is not there that was once available.
And we have seen that in many places in the West.
And being from Arkansas, where we have a vibrant forest
products economy, and I know you are from Louisiana, where they
have the same, my constituents probably don't understand, nor
should they have to understand why we have to spend Federal
dollars to be able to do management on the forests. That is a
foreign concept because, usually, when you do management on the
forests, it generates revenue to not only pay for itself but to
go back into the landowners' pockets, which in this case is the
Treasury and the taxpayer.
And there was one time in the history of this country where
the Forest Service actually put more money back into the
Treasury than it cost to run the Forest Service. We are not
anywhere remotely even close to that anymore, and we are seeing
the levels of fire danger increase. We are seeing the amount of
land that is subject to catastrophic wildfire increase. We are
seeing more mills close, and the train is going in the wrong
direction.
I know that you know this, I know this, and we ought to be
able to work together to figure out how to turn the train
around and make America's forests all that they should be. I
look forward to hearing your testimony and to having a dialogue
about how we can work together to use the resources that we
have to create a better situation for America's forests, which
means creating a better situation for America's wildlife, for
America's air quality, for America's water quality, and all the
other benefits that go with a healthy forest.
With that, I yield back.

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Chairman Westerman. We will now
move on to witness testimony.
Let me remind the witness that under Committee Rules, you
must limit your oral statement to 5 minutes, but your entire
statement will appear in the hearing record.
To begin your testimony, please press the ``on'' button on
the microphone. We use timing lights. When you begin, the light
will turn green. At the end of 5 minutes, the light will turn
red.
I would like to introduce Mr. Randy Moore, Chief of the
U.S. Forest Service.
Chief Moore, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF RANDY MOORE, CHIEF, U.S. FOREST SERVICE, U.S.
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, WASHINGTON, DC

Mr. Moore. Thank you, Chair Tiffany, Ranking Member
Kamlager-Dove, and the members of the Subcommittee. Thank you
for inviting me to testify today. We are grateful for your
continued support.
The President's budget names three primary goals for us: to
modernize wildland fire management, to sustain investments
critical to our mission, and to ensure equitable access and
benefits to Americans. Today, I will share our progress as we
put money to work to confront serious challenges. I will share
how our work will continue to be a sound investment.
We directly steward about 193 million acres of National
Forest System lands. We reach across boundaries to assist
states, tribes, communities, and private landowners to keep
millions more acres of healthy forests productive. Every
American benefits from these forests, directly or indirectly.
Together these lands provide basic needs for life, clean air
and water, while they contribute to energy production and
support local economies. National forests alone contribute more
than 410,000 jobs and $44.3 billion to the gross domestic
product.
To sustain productivity and health, forests must be able to
withstand threats posed by wildfire, climate change, drought,
insects, and disease, and on and on. We invested resources to
act and ensure that they do just that. Foremost, we prioritize
work to reduce wildfire risk, safeguard communities, and create
resilient forests.
In 2022, we launched a 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy and
we moved to implement it. Annual appropriations, coupled with
the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation
Reduction Act, provided an extraordinary opportunity to take
bold and strategic actions. We did just that. We progressed to
deliver on a promise to increase the pace and scale of our
treatments. We are not just treating any acre, we are treating
the right acres in the right places and at the right scale. We
focused initial efforts on 21 priority landscapes within
Western firesheds at the highest risk. They account for roughly
80 percent of wildfire risk.
These investments are paying dividends. Experts reported
roughly $700 billion worth of housing and infrastructure are at
risk within these priority landscapes. This includes $6.5
billion of municipal watersheds which supply drinking water to
12 million people. In the last 2 years, we reduced the average
wildfire risk to these assets by 8 percent for infrastructure,
8 percent for housing, and 12 percent for watersheds. That
means that we protected more than $300 million worth of homes
at risk.
In the Stanislaus National Forest, for example, 17
communities are at lower risk, including towns of Cold Springs
and Strawberry. A million socially vulnerable people are at
less risk. Nearly half of national forest lands and priority
landscapes are now considered unlikely to burn at high
intensity. We must remain on course and build on these gains.
We recognize the urgency of investing in a permanent and a
comprehensive pay increase to provide a more livable wage,
enhance recruitment, and stabilize retention. We must also
improve housing conditions and provide better care for our
firefighters' physical and mental health. We look forward to
seeing an end to reports of firefighters living in cars with
few benefits and limited mental health care.
In addition to work to address the wildfire crisis and
firefighters, we continue to take action that supports access
and benefits from forests. Visitor use, hunting and fishing,
energy and minerals development, forest products, and livestock
grazing generate 69 percent of the contributions to the
economy.
Thanks to the Great American Outdoors Act funds, we
relieved some of the pressures from the $8.6 billion of backlog
that we have. The budget requests $58 million to maintain
critical recreation services, with a focus on offering
welcoming and equitable opportunities.
We are also making a difference in our urban environments.
The Forest Service and partners are planting and maintaining
trees in cities and areas where 84 percent of Americans live.
Trees combat extreme heat and climate change, and they also
improve access to nature.
The 2025 budget returns basic funding to most programs.
This includes forest products, which are vital to sustaining
rural communities. This includes sustainable timber supply. We
know it is a critical component and is part of a complex,
market-driven system. And while we don't control markets, we
can support industry through forest products and wood
innovations which help mills adapt and modernize. And while the
current industry adapts, the agency has taken strides to
support the existing industry by investing nearly $80 million
over the last 3 years in directly supporting sawmills and other
forest products manufacturing facilities.
We have also expanded the wood basket for mills through the
build and timber transport program, and authorized extensions
to timber sale contracts to provide relief from the decline in
the demand for paper products.

In closing, we are fully committed to meeting the
challenges before us with the resources Congress provided. The
people of America deserve nothing less than to see their money
put to work to benefit all. Thank you, and I welcome your
comments.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Moore follows:]
Prepared Statement of Randy Moore, Chief, USDA Forest Service

Chair Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here today to testify on the
President's fiscal year (FY) 2025 Budget request for the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service.
The fiscal year 2025 President's Budget for the USDA Forest Service
discretionary appropriations totals $6.5 billion for base programs and
$2.4 billion for the wildfire suppression cap adjustment (through the
Wildfire Suppression Operations Reserve Fund). The fiscal year 2025
Budget focuses on three primary areas: modernizing the wildland fire
management workforce; sustaining the foundational investments critical
to the mission of the Forest Service; and ensuring equitable access to
and benefits from the National Forest System.
America's forests provide timber, clean air and water, forage, and
energy production. They support local economies through employment,
trade, recreation, tourism, green jobs, and livestock grazing. They
host and protect sites and landscapes of high cultural, spiritual, or
recreational value. These benefits are at risk from wildfires, pests,
diseases, invasive species, and drought, all of which are exacerbated
by climate change. It is vital to continue to act now to mitigate these
threats and protect our resources. Alongside our partners, the Forest
Service will continue to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires to
communities in FY 2025 through investments in the wildland fire
management workforce and throughout the high-priority landscapes
identified within the agency's 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy. The
investments highlighted below reflect services the Forest Service
delivers through work on National Forests, partnerships with State,
Private, and Tribal landowners, and our Research and Development
mission area. These investments enable the Forest Service to restore
long-term forest health and resiliency across landscapes the American
people rely on while ensuring equitable access to the resources on
National Forest System lands.
Recent analysis shows that in FY 2022, Forest Service programs and
work contributed approximately 410,400 jobs (average of annual full-
time, part-time, temporary, and seasonal) and $44.3 billion in Gross
Domestic Product (GDP). Recreational visitor use, hunting and fishing,
energy and minerals development, forest products, and livestock grazing
generated 69 percent of the economic activity. The Forest Service
continues to be a good place to invest and will maximize every dollar
invested into our agency, making every dollar work for the American
people. The citizens we serve deserve nothing less than to see the
value of their money at work for their benefit.
The President's FY 2025 Budget Request for Specific Priorities

The following investments align with and enhance the agency's
efforts to modernize and invest in our wildland fire management
workforce:

The 2025 Budget proposes $2.6 billion for base Wildland
Fire Management activities, investing in firefighter
compensation, benefits, mental health, and wellbeing, and
supporting the objectives of the agency's 10-year Wildfire
Crisis Strategy.

o  Provides $216 million to implement a permanent,
comprehensive pay increase for the wildland firefighter
workforce, providing a more equitable wage, enhancing
recruitment, and stabilizing retention.

o  $136 million for additional federal firefighting capacity
(570 more permanent firefighters and continued transition to a
more full-time workforce) to enable the Forest Service to more
effectively meet the demands of the increasingly year-round
wildfire season, while improving the work-life balance of
firefighters and support personnel.

o  $10 million for mental health and well-being assistance to
ensure our wildfire firefighter workforce are supported in
managing the mental and physical aspects of their mission.

In addition, the Budget proposes $25 million to address
the urgent need for suitable employee housing through
necessary maintenance and repairs of Forest Service housing
units.
The 2025 Budget proposes to fund the National Forest System at $2
billion, prioritizing recreation service delivery, climate smart land
management, forest products, law enforcement, and the Collaborative
Forest Landscape Restoration Program, while maintaining foundational
hazardous fuels treatments to reduce wildfire risk:

$207 million for Hazardous Fuels Reduction: to return to
previously enacted program levels and mitigate wildfire
risk on 4.0 million acres with a focus on high-priority and
high-risk firesheds, building on hazardous fuels funding
from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation
Reduction Act, and in aligning with the agency's 10-Year
Wildfire Crisis Strategy.

$58 million for Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness: to
provide critical recreation operations, planning, services,
and improvements, with particular emphasis on creating
welcoming, sustainable, and equitable recreation
opportunities for all Americans with a focus toward
underserved and Tribal communities.

$41 million for Forest Products: to support the
foundational funding needed to maintain the Forest
Service's ability to sell timber, which can be a critical
component to sustaining local rural communities.

$33 million for Vegetation and Watershed Management: to
provide support for healthy and resilient watersheds and
landscapes, sustain the production of clean and abundant
air and water, assist with meeting the Administration's
climate goals, and contribute to healthy and productive
communities and Tribal Nations.

$34 million for Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration
Program: to invest in communities and regions with a
collaborative, common purpose in reducing wildfire risk and
improving forest health and resiliency.

$21 million for Law Enforcement Operations: to provide
critical law enforcement response for the prevention,
detection, and criminal investigation of violations of
Federal laws and regulations for the protection of visitors
to National Forest System lands, Forest Service employees,
and natural and cultural resources.

$1.5 billion for National Forest System Salaries and
Expenses: to maintain the workforce needed to support the
agency programs critical for forest health and resiliency,
which complement the 10-Year Wildfire Crisis Strategy.

Further investments ensure that the Forest Service relies on the
latest science and technology to deliver results on the ground and for
the people:

$470 million for Information Technology Capabilities:
continue modernization of our Information Technology
systems that allow the public to better access our
services, sustain emergency communication systems, and
provide our workforce the tools they need to carry out our
conservation mission.

$316 million for Forest and Rangeland Research: continue
investments in research priorities, with a focus on climate
change-related research including reforestation, carbon
accounting, and fire and fuels research.

These investments continue to build on the historic investments
provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) (P.L. 117-58) and
the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) (P.L. 117-169). The Forest Service
will continue to strengthen our long-standing work and relationships
with States, Tribes, local communities, private landowners, and other
stakeholders to adapt lessons learned into a coordinated and effective
program of work to improve the resiliency of landscapes and watersheds,
reduce wildfire risk, protect and maintain infrastructure, support
outdoor recreation, establish tree canopy in nature-deprived
communities, and invest in the reforestation of America's impacted
landscapes.
The Forest Service cannot succeed in this work alone, especially
when addressing the firesheds highest at risk, which are typically in
multiple ownerships. Through meaningful communication, expanded
partnerships, and broader community support, the Forest Service will
increase the use of prescribed fire and other fuel treatments and the
management of unplanned ignitions to reduce long-term wildfire risks.
Fortunately, we have decades of experience working through partnerships
and collaboration based on common values and shared goals across shared
landscapes as set out over 20 years ago in the National Cohesive
Wildland Fire Management Strategy.
Ensuring Equitable Access to and Benefits from the National Forest
System

The Forest Service remains unwavering in its commitment to the
values of equity, inclusion, and equal opportunities for its employees
and the public it serves. The Forest Service maintains the intent to
focus on prioritizing activities that will provide benefits to
disadvantaged or underserved communities. The Forest Service vows to
proactively engage in actions that ensure a safe, resilient, and
harassment-free work culture where employees are treated with respect
and dignity.
The Forest Service will continue to invest in actions that
facilitate access to the vital resources our forests and grasslands
provide. This effort is twofold. First, we must ensure that those who
rely on these services and benefits can access those benefits safely.
Therefore, we are committed to improving the operation and maintenance
of our extensive infrastructure portfolio that includes buildings,
dams, communication sites, recreation sites, roads, trails, and
bridges. Second, to carry out this work effectively, the Forest Service
is committed to continued intentional internal and external engagement
with Tribal Nations and communities that live by, visit, and depend on
national forests. The Forest Service is committed to identifying and
removing barriers to access Forest Service programs and services for
historically underserved communities. This will be done by integrating
equity-centered criteria in the design, funding, and prioritization of
all policies, programs, and activities to center equity considerations
as part of the decision process. The Forest Service will also work to
remove barriers and boost economic opportunities through improved
access to contracts, grants and agreements, and permits.
Leveraging Additional Funding Authorities

It is expected that by FY 2025, much of the funding from the IRA
will have been invested, but along with the tools and investments
proposed in the FY2025 Presidents Budget, the Forest Service will
continue to leverage funding within the BIL to combat climate change
and confront the wildfire crisis, create new markets and technology for
wood products, and restore forest health and resiliency through
partnerships and collaboration across landscapes.
The BIL provided $1.4 billion for hazardous fuels treatments, while
the Inflation Reduction Act provided an additional $1.8 billion for
hazardous fuels work within the wildland urban interface. In February,
we announced $500 million for FY 2024 to expand work on the Forest
Service's strategy to reduce the risk to communities, critical
infrastructure and forests from the nation's growing wildfire crisis.
From 2022-2024, we have invested a combined $1.6 billion in the 21
high-priority landscapes identified under the agency's 10-Year Wildfire
Crisis Strategy as we continue moving these landscapes toward a
maintenance state. These investments will help reduce the risk of
wildfire to communities, Tribal lands, ecosystems, and critical
infrastructure, including utility corridors and public water sources.
Our work under the 10-Year Wildfire Crisis Strategy provides many
values the public depends on and cares about including beginning to
reduce risk to approximately 550 communities, of which 475 are
underserved; 2,500 miles of power lines; and 1,800 municipal
watersheds.
Through Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) (P.L. 116-152) funding,
the Forest Service continues to repair and upgrade vital infrastructure
and facilities in the national forests and grasslands through the
National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund (GAOA-LRF). In
both FY 2024 and 2025, increased emphasis was given to using GAOA-LRF
funding to address deferred maintenance on Forest Service-owned housing
units as one step toward helping our employees confront the housing
availability and affordability crisis in this country. In addition to
the $40 million Congress approved in FY 2024, we are proposing another
$30 million in housing-related GAOA-LRF projects to address this
critical need. It is estimated that in FY 2025, GAOA-LRF projects at FS
will contribute 3,200 jobs and $360 million in GDP.
In closing, the President's FY 2025 Budget request for the Forest
Service proposes a landmark investment that reflects the
Administration's ongoing commitment to building and sustaining a robust
and resilient Federal wildland fire management workforce, maintains
funding priorities for risk-based wildfire reduction, and improves
overall access to and utilization of our National Forests System. The
FY 2025 Budget request also highlights the importance of restoring and
creating resilient landscapes, improving infrastructure, and removing
barriers to access. We look forward to working with this Subcommittee
to fulfill the President's goals and our key responsibilities for the
long-term benefit of the Nation's forests and grasslands, and for all
Americans. I will be glad to answer your questions.

Questions Submitted for the Record to the Honorable Randy Moore, Chief,
U.S. Forest Service

The Honorable Randy Moore did not submit responses to the Committee by
the appropriate deadline for inclusion in the printed record.

Questions Submitted by Representative Westerman

Question 1. During the hearing, Representative Stauber asked about
a ``temporary'' cap on backcountry permits in the Boundary Waters Canoe
Area. In response, you said: ``So we are currently working with the
local community to do just what you described. To date we have not made
a lot of progress, but I would be willing to get back with you by the
week's end to give you more specifics on what we have been able to do
within the community.''

1a) Did you get back with Representative Stauber by week's end?

1b) If not, why not?

1c) Will you commit to lifting the ``temporary'' cap on backcountry
permits in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area?

1d) What progress has the Forest Service made in reopening our
national forests and ensuring we return to pre-pandemic levels of
access?

Question 2. This committee has deep concerns with the Biden
administration's disproportionate focus on protecting so-called ``old-
growth'' and ``mature'' forests, not least because it diverts agency
efforts from addressing the wildfire crisis and because such terms are
poorly defined. Yet the Forest Service recently published a Notice of
Intent to amend all 128 national forest land management plans to
provide direction on how to manage, conserve, and steward ``old-
growth'' forest conditions.

2a) In general, how long have forest plan revisions taken to
complete in the last 5 years?

2b) How long is the process of amending all 128 forest plans
expected to take?

2c) Please provide an estimate of the total hours that the Forest
Service's staff has already spent and plans to continue spending on
this ``old-growth'' amendment process.

2d) Absent this focus on ``old-growth,'' would Forest Service staff
have more time to spend working on wildfire risk-reduction and NEPA-
compliant forest management projects?

Question 3. In January 2024, the Forest Service and the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM) released an introductory report that identified
wildfire, insects, and diseases as the leading threats to ``mature and
old-growth'' forests and even admitted that ``tree cutting'' is a minor
threat that generally ``improved or maintained'' the stands that had
been managed. Given these findings, should the Forest Service instead
focus on expanding its forest treatment efforts?

Question 4. The 2012 Planning Rule consciously chose to leave old
growth issues to the individual plan development process, rather than
promulgating national standards or guidelines for old growth.

4a) What changed between the adoption of the 2012 Planning Rule and
April of 2021 when President Biden signed the Executive Order on Old
Growth that made a single national approach the correct one?

4b) You were regional forester in Region 9 when this took place. Do
you believe the Forest plans adopted in Region 9 when you were regional
forester were adequately or inadequately protective of old growth?

4c) Can you provide the committee with information regarding
whether old growth has increased or decreased in the region since 2009
when the forest plans were last revised?

Question 5. You mentioned that there is a large amount of timber
under contract that has not yet been cut. Can you please provide the
committee with the following information:

5a) The volume under contract for as many previous fiscal years as
possible, but at least the last 10 years.

5b) The type of timber under contract--sawtimber, pulpwood,
biomass, other convertible, etc.

5c) The volume of timber under contract but either under injunction
or withdrawn due to litigation, by Forest Service region.

Question 6. Can you provide the committee with a breakdown of the
amount of volume under litigation by Forest Service Region?

Question 7. Chief Moore, during the hearing, there were several
discrepancies regarding the amount of timber sold by the Forest Service
in recent years. Please provide the amount sold annually, in billion
board feet (BBF), by the Forest Service for the past 10 fiscal years.

Question 8. Does the Forest Service count personal use firewood as
a timber accomplishment? If yes, has this always been the case?

Question 9. How much has personal use firewood contributed to
timber outputs during the past four years?

Question 10. How many fuel breaks have been established under the
categorical exclusion that was created by the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act?

10a) Where are these fuel breaks located?

10b) How many total acres do they cover?

10c) Did the Forest Service use commercial timber harvest to
establish any of these fuel breaks? If so, please identify them.

Question 11. The committee has learned that of roughly 55 wood
product facility closures in the last several years, 21 of them were in
close proximity to the National Forest System.

11a) Do you believe that the Forest Service should be striving to
keep these facilities operating, so that they can help provide a market
for wood products on the National Forest System?

11b) If so, what is the agency doing to prevent future closures of
wood products facilities?

Question 12. Across the country, timber mills are shutting down or
significantly curtailing operations due to a lack of reliable timber
supply. Congress has tried to assist by giving your agency tools like
20-year stewardship contracting authority, but the Forest Service has
failed to fully utilize that tool. Given that your agency is planning
to reduce timber harvesting levels, what concrete steps can the Forest
Service take to sustain and expand forest products infrastructure?

Question 13. During questioning from Representative Pete Stauber,
you said that the Forest Service would have met its Fiscal Year (FY)
2023 timber-harvesting goal ``but for litigation.''

13a) Please provide a list of all litigation that prevented the
Forest Service from reaching this target.

13b) Please provide an estimate of the amount of timber, in BBF,
that each lawsuit or settlement cited above prevented from being
harvested in FY 2023.

Question 14. The Forest Service has lowered its timber-harvesting
goal from 3.4 BBF in FY 2023 to 3.2 BBF for both FY 2024 and FY 2025.

14a) Is the Forest Service currently on track to meet this reduced
goal for FY 2024? If not, why not?

14b) Did the Forest Service lower these goals at least partially as
a response to ongoing or anticipated litigation?

14c) If so, please provide a list of all litigation that influenced
this determination.

Question 15. The partial fix to the Cottonwood decision expired in
March 2023. Please describe the effects that the Cottonwood decision,
and litigation generally, continue to have on the Forest Service's
ability to actively manage our nation's forests.
Question 16. Road access is especially important in those U.S.
Forest Service lands that are located near and along the U.S.-Mexico
border. A few years ago, I toured the Coronado National Forest in
Arizona with CBP officials who stated that the inability to build
proper access roads diminished agent mobility and reduced the
effectiveness of border enforcement measures. This, in turn, poses
dangers to officer safety when they must engage in the pursuit or
apprehension of suspected perpetrators.

16a) Will you commit to supporting the construction of more roads
on Forest Service lands along the southern border to protect our law
enforcement officers and increase operational control of the border?

16b) Have you had any discussions with Homeland Security Secretary
Alejandro Mayorkas--or any top Homeland Security officials--about how
to address these challenges?

Question 17. President Biden's open-border policy has contributed
to increased drug trafficking and cultivation on federal lands. The
Forest Service recently detected more than 5,800 illegal cannabis
cultivation sites within our national forests. Since illegal
cultivation activities have sparked massive wildfires, their growing
presence on national forest lands remains a serious concern. In fact,
in this year's budget request, the Forest Service admits that it has
``likely underestimat[ed] the threat of [marijuana cultivation]
activity on Federal public lands.''

17a) What concrete steps is the Forest Service taking to reduce
illegal drug production in national forests?

17b) This year's budget request explains that when the Forest
Service recently used new technology to survey a mere 4 percent of only
3 national forests, it found 77 illegal drug cartel cultivation sites
that had gone undetected for 20 years. Given that this alarming figure
pertains to just a fraction of our national forests, does the Forest
Service plan to expand this kind of surveillance?

Question 18. The Forest Service budget requested decreased funding
for the Joint Fire Science Program, which funds scientific studies on
managing wildland fires. Why is this program being cut, while other
budget items that are wholly unrelated to forest health are receiving
increases?

Question 19. How many miles of road has the Forest Service
decommissioned per year from FY 2004 to FY 2024? Please break down the
annual figures by state, region, or both.

Question 20. How many miles of road will the Forest Service
decommission pursuant to the FY 2025 budget? Please break down this
figure by state, region, or both.

Question 21. In response to Chairman Tiffany's question, ``What is
a green job?'' you replied that a green job is a job that involves
``working with the environment to keep it healthy and resilient.''

21a) Earlier in the hearing, you stated that timber harvesting is
``necessary'' for effective forest management and reducing wildfire
risk. By this logic, should timber-harvesting jobs qualify as ``green
jobs''?

21b) If not, why not?

Question 22. The Forest Service has reduced its forest treatment
goal for this year to just 4 million acres, which--by the agency's own
estimates--is inadequate for confronting the nation's current wildfire
risk. I'm concerned that the Forest Service is now shifting the
goalposts to ``outcome-based'' metrics when, just a few short years
ago, your agency--not Congress--set acreage-based targets. The Forest
Service has also received $11.5 billion in taxpayer funding to achieve
this goal of treating 20 million acres in 10 years.

22a) How are we supposed to hold the agency accountable if we're
not measuring progress based on acres treated?

22b) How is this change in metrics consistent with the 10-year
Wildfire Strategy?

Question 23. Wildfires do not respect administrative boundaries,
which is why collaboration with states, Tribes, and other stakeholders
is crucial for fire prevention. Within the Forest Service, the State,
Private and Tribal Forestry organization is tasked with facilitating
much of this needed cross-boundary work. The FY 2025 budget, however,
decreases funding for that account by roughly $32 million.

The Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission's most
recent report found that federal agencies must do more to engage tribes
in meaningful co-management agreements. So, why is this funding being
reduced?

Question 24. President Biden's 30x30 Initiative is often described
as a campaign to conserve 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030.
Critically, however, the administration has failed to make clear what
counts as conservation. For example, on the newly created
conservation.gov, the administration lists most National Forest System
land as not contributing, or only pending additions, to the national
conservation goals.

24a) Does the Forest Service share the view, apparently held by the
Biden administration, that most of the National Forest System lands are
insufficiently conserved?

i) If so, please explain why.

ii) If not, please explain why not.

Question 25. There is broad international and domestic consensus
about the carbon benefits of using more wood products in construction.
In fact, at the December 2023 COP 28 summit in Dubai, the U.S. and 16
other countries agreed to increase sustainable forestry and the use of
wood products in construction as ``a vital decarbonization strategy.''
However, the U.S. currently imports about one third of its lumber. The
Forest Service manages about 188 million acres of national forests,
including some of the most productive forests in the world, but
provides very little of our demand for lumber and other wood products.

Do you believe that the Forest Service has a responsibility to
sustainably manage a portion of its lands in a manner that meets some
of our need for carbon friendly wood products?

Question 26. The Forest Service provides several important reports
for tracking the agency's timber sale program and harvest trends,
including the ``Forest Products Cut and Sold report,'' ``Periodic
Timber Sale Accomplishment Reports,'' and ``Harvest Trends on National
Forest System Lands.'' The most recent data available in the ``Harvest
Trends on National Forest System Lands'' report is from 2021.

Please provide an updated version of this report and make this
updated report available to the public on the Forest Service website.

Questions Submitted by Representative Fulcher

Just recently the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) forecasted a very
high risk for wildfires in the West this year. Low precipitation
combined with a high fuel mix creates a challenging problem for rural
communities and the electric utilities that serve them. Electric
cooperatives in my state are doing everything within their power to
mitigate wildfire risk but extreme weather conditions remain an
uncertainty and are ultimately hard to plan for because of the
unknowns. These utilities are not for profit and all additional costs
are borne by their customers.

Unfortunately, I understand the USFS is looking to charge utilities
with power line corridors through their lands nearly $3 million per
fire incident for strict liability damages. Smaller, rural electric
cooperatives and the communities they serve cannot bear this level of
damages. Already these utilities are finding it difficult to obtain
wildfire insurance. This level of damage would bankrupt these
utilities. I'm curious about your authority to unilaterally increase
strict liability damages for powerline corridors.

Question 1. Could you confirm that this is accurate, and if so,
will you work with my office to collaborate with utilities on this
matter?

Question 2. Under what authority can the USFS charge strict
liability damages and how does the agency justify this one-size-fits
all level of damages?

Questions Submitted by Representative Stauber

Question 1. Please provide an estimate of the number of acres of
National Forests within the state of Minnesota would be covered by the
old growth plan amendment, and specifically the number of acres that
are needed to satisfy the requirements laid out in the Service's Notice
of Intent (NOI) to provide for ``connectivity, ``recruitment,'' and
``adjacency'' in old growth management.

Question 2. As you state during the hearing, prescribed fires are
only one of the many critical tools used to prevent catastrophic fire
on our nation's public and private lands. Last May, the EPA finalized a
new ambient air quantity standard for fine particulate matter,
otherwise known as PM2.5 NAAQS.

2a) Can the Committee assume that the recent PM 2.5 NAAQS ruling
will have zero impact on federal, state, and private land managers'
ability to utilize controlled burns to safely manage our nation's
forests?

2b) As states develop implementation plans to meet EPA's new
standard, how will USDA and EPA work collaboratively to ensure that the
states implementing the new standard do not remove this critical fire
prevention tool?

2c) Further, because fire doesn't know boundaries between federal
and private lands and since private lands represent approximately 70%
of total working forest acres, how is USDA working to ensure that all
forests retain this critical management tool?

2d) Is the agency concerned about the impact the PM 2.55 NAAQS
ruling will have on the future success of wood products market
development, and if so, how is the Agency working to ensure that rural
economic health and public health can be achieved cooperatively?

Question 3. The inflation reduction act (IRA) directed the General
Services Administration (GSA) to acquire and install materials that
have substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions,
as determined by the EPA. In response, EPA developed a low embodied
pilot program and interim determination that prioritized concrete,
glass, asphalt, and steel as qualifying for the allocated IRA funding.
Products with lower embodied carbon, including bio-based materials,
were segregated into a separate category for ``further exploration,''
and tasked among others, USFS for developing guidance to support the
purchase of bio-based materials, including wood products.

3a) Your agency continues to invest in wood products through
programs like the Wood Innovation Grant Program and the Community Wood
Facility Grant Program. What steps has USFS taken to develop guidance
per EPA's request?

Question 4. One of the most effective ways to reduce embodied
carbon in buildings is to build with wood products. Structural wood
products do not require the same energy intensive manufacturing process
that is common for other building materials. Additionally, wood
products are unique in the fact that they store carbon--these materials
are approximately 50% carbon by dry weight.

4a) Given this, why has this administration chosen to prioritize
concrete, glass, asphalt, and steel?

4b) Given USFS's investment into wood products, has your agency
made any effort to ensure that wood products included in administration
policies which purport to lower carbon?

Question 5. On March 9, 2023, the Forest Service proposed changes
to its cost recovery regulations pertaining to Land Uses; Special Uses;
Strict Liability Limit and Insurance. The agency proposed dramatically
raising cost recovery fees for special use permits in the first four
categories of cost recovery, eliminating the current 50-hour exemption
for outdoor recreation permits. The 50-hour exemption was first
implemented in 2006 in the final cost recovery rule to lessen the
impact on small entities. The proposed rule increases cost recovery
fees starting at $255 for less than 8 hours of work and up to $3,313
for processing costs that require between 40 and 64 hours. The final
rule has not been published in the Federal Register.

5a) Is the Forest Service still planning to totally eliminate the
exemption for the first 50 hours of work?

5b) There are no refunds for categories 1 through 4 even if the
agency does not respond or complete the work paid for under cost
recovery. Are you planning to modify that portion of the rule to
provide a refund if the agency fails to act?

5c) Is the pre-decisional objection process for project-level
actions subject to cost recovery?

5d) When does the Forest Service expect to publish the final cost
recovery rule?

Question 6. The Forest Service has been encouraged to look at the
expansion of categorical exclusions (CATEX's) for routine special
recreation permit re-issuance. The agency has made some progress in
implementing CATEX's for ministerial permit renewal. However, in
designated wilderness, we are faced with hurdles outside the NEPA
process, such as the Minimum Requirements Analysis (MRA) for activities
that are prohibited in the wilderness but which may be necessary to
fulfill the purposes of the Act. Some so-called ``non-conforming'' uses
are authorized by Congress when a Wilderness is designated. An example
would be the authorization for motorboat towing service in the Boundary
Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

6a) Does the MRA apply to these congressionally authorized uses?

6b) Are there additional categorical exclusions and streamlining
actions the agency can take to improve the efficiency of issuing
recreational special use permits?

Question 7. In the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, the
Superior National Forest imposed a ``temporary'' cap on backcountry
permits at 80% of the previous cap in response to increased use during
the COVID-19 pandemic. When will this temporary cap be lifted?

Question 8. The Forest Service is revising SUDS, a web-based
application used by Special Uses administrators to authorize permit
leases and easements, amend these authorizations, and track billing
information in the Recreation and Lands Programs. Program managers use
the system to collect, analyze, maintain, and track data about special
use permits and revenue, including data about land use and cost
recovery.

8a) What is the status of that revision, how much does it cost, and
when do you expect it to be launched?

8b) Are there any issues complicating SUDS implementation?

8c) Will these changes interrupt the processing of special use
permit applications?

______

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Chief Moore, for your testimony. We
really appreciate that you are here today. And I will now
recognize Members for 5 minutes.
We are going to take a couple rounds of questioning here
before we break for votes. I recognize the gentleman from
Minnesota for 5 minutes.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Chief Moore, thank you once again for coming before the
Subcommittee.
Despite dramatic budget increases in Fiscal Year 2022 and
2023, we are seeing reduced access to outdoor recreation and
diminished public benefits across the National Forest System.
This has been evident in the Superior National Forest in
northern Minnesota, for example.
In the Boundary Waters Canoe Area a ``temporary cap on
backcountry permits,'' equal to 80 percent of their previous
cap, was put in place in response to increased demand and use
during the COVID-19 pandemic. During that time campsites in the
BWCA were also closed, but many of those campsites still have
not reopened today. Clearly, these caps are not temporary.
What progress has the Forest Service made in reopening our
national forests and ensuring we return to pre-pandemic levels
of access?
Mr. Moore. Thank you for that question, Congressman.
We are currently working with the local community to do
just what you described. To date, we have not made a lot of
progress, but I would be willing to get back with you by the
week's end to give you more specifics on what we have been able
to do within the community.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you. The Service is largely reliant on a
Ticketmaster-style online permit registration system involving
a mad dash to compete for a limited number of permits when they
are released. Oftentimes, people buy up large blocks of permits
that often go unused. And I recognize this isn't just an issue
for the BWCA or the Superior National Forest or the Forest
Service.
That said, what specifically is the Forest Service doing to
address this?
Mr. Moore. First of all, we want to be able to really
understand what is going on. And we are trying to be responsive
to what people are choosing to do by buying up blocks. So, we
are looking into it to see what opportunities we have to limit
what we see happening across that whole system. And to date, I
don't have any news to report to you in terms of the progress
that we have made on that.
Mr. Stauber. Chief, are you looking to limit the big blocks
of buying the permits for entry? Is that what you just said?
Mr. Moore. We are going to be looking at all of it,
including the big blocks.
Mr. Stauber. OK. Well, let me ask you this. Would
increasing the number of available permits and returning to
pre-pandemic levels of access help alleviate this issue or make
it worse?
Mr. Moore. Yes, I think it would, Congressman.
Mr. Stauber. Changing gears a bit, would you consider
timber harvesting to be an important tool for the Forest
Service to protect against wildfire risk?
Mr. Moore. Yes, timber is a necessary tool.
Mr. Stauber. In Fiscal Year 2024, the Forest Service missed
its timber harvesting target by approximately 260 million board
feet. That includes missing the mark on forests like the
Chippewa and Superior National Forests. You missed your 3.4
billion board feet goal by over 7.5 percent, almost 8 percent.
How does missing this timber harvesting goal affect the forest
system's wildfire risk?
Mr. Moore. Congressman, one of the challenges we have is
litigation. And if you look at the amount of litigation we have
with our problems, we would have exceeded our timber targets.
We have no control over that part of it. We just have to deal
with it.
Our plan was to meet or exceed our targets. We would have
done that, but for the litigation that we are currently under.
Mr. Stauber. The weaponizing of the court system is what
you are saying?
Mr. Moore. I am saying that we would have met our targets,
but for litigation.
Mr. Stauber. The Service has lowered its timber harvesting
goal from 3.4 billion board feet to 3.2 billion board feet for
the next 2 years. If the Forest Service is aiming to harvest
200 million less board feet of timber over the next year, how
do you plan to address this delta in terms of the wildfire
risk?
Mr. Moore. Well, actually, for the last 20 years, our
timber harvesting has gone up. In fact, if I look at the last
20 years, we have increased our timber harvesting by roughly 30
percent. I am not really sure about the numbers that you are
spouting, but I would be happy to meet with you separately to
look at the numbers that you have, and where you got those
numbers from, and compare to what we are showing in our books.
Mr. Stauber. We got them from the professionals in the
Forest Service.
And thanks in large part to the decreased availability of
timber from Federal lands, mills across this country are
closing, including several in my district, that have led to
layoffs for hundreds of employees.
And given that many of our national forests are working
industrial forests, does the Forest Service take into
consideration lost economic activity when it makes decisions
that limit responsible industrial use of our forests?
Mr. Moore. Yes, Congressman. I mean, any time a mill
closes, it hurts us, as well. And many of our employees have
grown up and lived in those same communities.
Mr. Stauber. I have 1 second left. I appreciate, Chief
Moore, that you said in your comments that you are looking at
national forests to produce energy and mineral development. The
Superior National Forest is a working industrial forest where
mining and timber harvesting are a desired condition. And we
want to keep that just as it is. Thank you very much.
I yield back, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Tiffany. Yes, I just add to the gentleman from
Minnesota we have talked to the Chief offline here. We want to
see those numbers where they are saying that those harvest
levels have actually gone up. We want to look at them in the
long term as well as the short term. And we will be working
with members of the Committee and with the Chief to compare
those numbers and see where the differences lie.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Tiffany. I would now like to recognize the Ranking
Member, Ms. Kamlager-Dove, for 5 minutes for her questioning.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
And thank you, Chief Moore, for your testimony. I just want
to add that a Fiscal Year 2022 economic analysis found,
actually, that the U.S. fire service programs contributed $44.3
billion in gross domestic product and contributed 410,000 jobs.
I think that is a very strong return on investment for the
appropriations that you all have received.
Can you share how the Forest Service is addressing the most
critical landscapes through the 10-year Wildfire Crisis
Strategy and the funding provided from the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act?
Mr. Moore. Yes, I would be happy to.
The Wildfire Crisis Strategy involves and includes about 21
different landscapes across the West primarily. In those 21
landscapes, we have identified 550 communities within it, 2,500
miles of utility corridor lines. And we also have about 1,800
municipal or priority watersheds that serve as drinking water
for 12 million people.
So, in that we are looking at the type of investment that
we are making in those landscapes that are so important to the
American people. And to date, just in the last 1\1/2\ to 2
years of implementation of the Wildfire Crisis Strategy, we
reduced the risk to homes by 8 percent. We reduced the risk to
utility corridors and that critical infrastructure about
another 8 percent. And then, on those watersheds that are so
important, we reduced the risk there about 12 percent.
And you may say, well, what does all of this mean? And what
it really means in other terms is that we reduced the risk to
about $300 million worth of homes. And we have also reduced the
risk to drinking water that serves 12 million people. This is
only after the first 1\1/2\ years of implementation of the
Wildfire Crisis Strategy. And we feel that, with sustained
investment, you will continue to see that investment improve
$700 billion worth of values just within those 21 landscapes.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Great. Has funding been dispersed to all
21 landscapes, including identified landscapes in Southern
California?
Mr. Moore. Yes. Southern California is one of the
landscapes. We also have some in Northern California, and we
have them across the West primarily, and we have about $1.8
billion that have been identified to work on that. And we have
treated approximately 1 million acres within the 21 landscapes
so far.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Great. And what will happen to your
progress treating critical landscapes when the funding runs
out?
Mr. Moore. I would like to ask Congress what happens if it
runs out, because all of the progress that we are building and
creating would be at risk or at jeopardy. Because once we
create these conditions, what we don't talk about quite often
is maintaining those conditions that we have invested in
creating, and it is very critical.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Yes, thank you. There have been some
narratives out there that conservation and climate resilience
is a misplaced priority. But the reality is that the
investments made possible from those funding bills have allowed
the Biden administration to support sustainable management and
restoration where there is an important need to reduce wildfire
risk or to restore ecosystem integrity. Do you want to add to
that?
Mr. Moore. Yes. I can't underscore the value that both the
BIL and IRA legislation has provided the Forest Service in
creating and really getting at what we consider the biggest
challenges to our forests, which are wildfire, disease, and
insects. And there are a lot of reasons for that, but it is
something that we continue to fall behind because we have not
had the resources to address the issues.
One example is when we look at the deferred maintenance
that we have across the agency, it was at $8.6 billion. With
GAOA, it has given us an opportunity to start looking at some
of that backlog that we have. And when you look at some of the
biggest challenges within that, roads, dams, and bridges create
about $5.4 billion of that $8 billion of backlog.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Thank you. There is also this narrative
that you all have still failed to meaningfully ramp up the
number of acres treated. But you have said before that the
performance is restricted by budget decreases and hazardous
fuels reduction, and across-the-board increases of operational
costs. In my last few seconds, do you want to add to that?
Mr. Moore. Yes, I think one of the really strategic
questions for this Committee and for us as well has to do with
how do we report, or what are our performance metrics? Because
the way that we have reported over the last 100 years, we need
to diversify how and what we report if we are going to move
into this future that is here.
And what I mean by that is not just outputs, but outcomes
of the work that we are doing on the landscapes because of the
values that it benefits and protects.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Thank you, I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize the
gentleman from Idaho, Mr. Fulcher.
Mr. Fulcher. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and, Chief Moore, it
is a pleasure to see you again. Thank you for being here and
for your work. We are clearly here to talk about the proposed
budget, but that is directly impacted by the use of resources
that your department impacts. So, I am going to kind of follow
a line of discussion in that vein if OK with you.
And you are familiar with my state, we have had
conversations before. We have about 34 million acres in Idaho
that is managed by the Federal Government. And the timber
industry is a huge part of that, and a major industry and a
major concern for us.
And Chairmen Westerman and Tiffany also talked about the
closures of mills and whatnot that is having an impact on all
of us. We are not immune from that. In fact, just within the
last few days, a major mill, Stimson Lumber Company in Idaho,
just announced that they will be closing. And I am going to
quote the CEO, a part of his statement here. According to the
CEO, ``Over time, the supply of the size of timber processes
has declined, and so we have had to reduce our production.''
And if I recall correctly, you have talked in the past, in
previous testimony, about the need for low-value materials and
markets for those materials. So, I just want to open this up
and get your feedback.
To me, it is pretty clear that we have an issue of access
to supply. That is one component. We have the issue of the
processing or the mills. And then we have the issue of the
markets. And if our numbers are correct, Chief Moore, about a
third, a little less than that, 30 percent of the U.S. supply
of lumber, of wood products comes from outside of the United
States, with Canada and China being at the top of those import
nations.
So, from my vantage point, it is not a market issue that we
have. It is an access to resource issue that we have. There is
not a shortage of timber in Idaho. There is not a shortage of
timber in the United States. But there appear to be very
significant constraints, and those constraints are shutting our
mills down.
I just want to open that up, and that is my monologue, but
I would like to get your commentary, as well.
Mr. Moore. Yes. Thank you, Congressman. This issue that you
raise, you are correct in so many different ways. Some of these
things that you may not be aware of, though, are the market
conditions, because markets are playing a role in this.
And to give you an example, I look at just Idaho alone. And
in Idaho, as of May 4 this past month, we sold 137 million
board feet there. Also, as of May 4 in Idaho, we have about 580
million board feet of timber that has been sold, but not yet
cut. So, it is not cut because of market conditions, and it is
playing a significant role in----
Mr. Fulcher. But Chief, if I could just interject for a
second, how are Canada and China able to come into our
country--maybe not Idaho specific, but into our country--and
compete, if that is true?
Mr. Moore. Well, it is true. And we do business with a lot
of countries, but I am only giving you the data that I have.
And I am saying, if I had to look nationally at that same
number, Congressmen, we have 8 billion board feet that have
been sold that is not cut.
So, there is a lot going on that is not being discussed or
talked about, and I think that we need to be really transparent
in what is really going on across the country. Because what you
are saying is correct, but also what I am saying is correct.
And there are conditions that we are not talking about that
also have a significant role in what is going on across our----
Mr. Fulcher. I know we are out of time, but I really,
sincerely want to connect with you and have further
conversations, because if there is a scenario where any other
country with a product, with the amount of freight involved and
processing and whatnot, that can ship to our country and
outcompete our domestic sourcing, there is something that has
to be looked at that is just not right, that needs attention.
And, unfortunately, I think it needs congressional
intervention.
Mr. Moore. Yes.
Mr. Fulcher. I am out of time. I thank you for your
exchange, and I sincerely want to continue this beyond this
discussion.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Moore. I would love to, by the way.
Mr. Fulcher. Thank you.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields. And as I stated
previously, and I am sure the gentleman from Idaho heard that,
we are going to be engaging with the Chief offline here, and
you are sure welcome to join us in regards to that. We want to
see the numbers that they are producing, as well as the other
numbers that are being produced by other folks who follow this
very closely.
Chief, I hope you can take a little break here, because we
do have to cast a couple votes. We will be back here as
promptly as possible.
The Committee stands in recess.
[Recess.]
Mr. Tiffany. The Committee will be in order.
I would now like to recognize the gentleman from Colorado
for 5 minutes of questioning.
Mr. Lamborn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chief Moore, last year, I asked you questions regarding
wildfire, specifically on thinning and fuels management. You
concurred that healthy forests should have between 50 to 80
trees per acre, as opposed to 250 to 300 that national forests
near my district have. As I said last time, in the fall of
2020, Colorado saw the two largest wildfires in state history:
the Cameron Peak Fire and the East Troublesome Fire. Most of
these happened on Federal land.
Despite robust funding, fuel material continues to pile up
on Federal lands. In fact, the Fiscal Year 2025 presidential
budget request asks for more money while targeting 200,000 less
acres than last year. Has there been any change since we spoke
on the Forest Service's position on tree thinning and fuels
management?
Mr. Moore. Yes, we are constantly looking at fuels
management. And in Colorado, particularly along the Front
Range, that is one of our priority landscapes. And we have
ramped up treatments in the Front Range landscapes, so we are
making, actually, a lot of progress there, Congressman, in
terms of what we are able to do in terms of treatments on those
landscapes.
Mr. Lamborn. OK, very good. Also, the last time that you
were in front of this Committee, you resisted the Forest
Service using fuel-related categorical exclusions, and that is
why I introduced the Locally-Led Restoration Act to provide
flexibility in stewardship contracts while focusing on wildlife
mitigation through fuel removal.
So, my question is, you mentioned collaborating with
community leaders. Please share what conversations, if any, you
have had regarding stewardship and timber contracts with
industry.
Mr. Moore. We have had a number of memoranda of
understandings and agreements with some of the industry folks.
One of the latest ones we have had was with NAFO, the
National Association of Forest Owners, and one of the contracts
there had to do with the timber owners or the landowners. We
have agreed to allow them to jump on a fire if it is in their
area during an initial attack. That has been in place for a
year now. And we went back and did an after-action review this
past winter to look to see if there was any value to that, and
we found out, with the timber and forest owners, that there was
value. In fact, we saw a couple of fires that they were able to
get to that could have grown into larger fires.
The other agreement that we have with the industry is to
look at opportunities after a fire for reforestation. So, we
entered into an agreement, actually, with Sierra Forest
Industries. And in that agreement, they have reforested some of
the national forest-managed land as they were doing theirs. And
I think we had about 120 acres this past year on that.
So, we are looking at a lot of different opportunities that
partner with industry and other community leaders to look at
bringing them into the decision space on what we do out there.
Mr. Lamborn. OK, that is good to see that progress being
made.
What this bill would do, as I just mentioned, is instead of
all-or-nothing contracts, it lets there be a counteroffer,
which is prevalent in the private sector but for some reason
doesn't exist with Forest Service. So, I would love to see that
legislation go forward, give you that authorization as another
tool in the toolkit and another way for industry to be relevant
in this space.
I have also proposed using private sectors in whatever
areas I can in all kinds of government service areas. There is
a shortage of lumber and wood products during the pandemic, for
instance, yet timber harvests have dropped since the early
1990s and wildfires have continued to skyrocket.
The United States produced 112 million board feet in 1987,
but in 2022 less than 5 million board feet. So, production has
gone down while wildfires have gone up. You mentioned the
problems with litigation. Are there other things that could be
done to restore some balance here?
No one is talking about clear cutting millions of acres,
but having some kind of balance with American jobs and products
so we don't have to import so much from other countries.
Mr. Moore. Yes, Congressman, I have committed earlier with
Chairman Tiffany to really take a look at our data because the
information that you just shared, I have different information
that says the opposite.
And I think you can sometimes have a seesaw effect from
year to year about what timber is, but my data is telling me
that we have seen slight increases over the last 20 years,
actually, to the tune of about 30 percent. So, I would like to
be able to sit down, and I have agreed already to sit down with
Committee members here to go into a bit more detail on sharing
that information.
Mr. Lamborn. OK. Thank you.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields. I would now like to
recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. McClintock, for
his 5 minutes of questioning.
Mr. McClintock. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Welcome, Chief Moore. I am having nostalgic feelings for
our meetings over the last 16 years, and I am very pleased to
welcome you as the Chief of the Forest Service here today.
A lot has happened in those 16 years, and it is
heartbreaking. I am sure you have had the same experience. In
my drives through the Sierra Nevada, whether it is to Yosemite
or Lake Tahoe, Sequoia-Kings Canyon, or drives up to the Oregon
border, beautiful forests that we used to take for granted are
now simply gone. They have been reduced to scrub brush and dead
tree trunks as far as the eye can see.
I asked my staff to look into that because, is this an
optical illusion, what do the statistics say? And their
estimate is that about 25 percent of our national forests have
burned down in the last 10 years. Does that comport with your
general figures?
Mr. Moore. Yes, I don't have the specific number, but I
wouldn't argue with that number, Congressman. A lot has burned.
Mr. McClintock. A quarter of our national forests gone,
simply gone. Now, I am sure they will grow back in a century or
two, but they are gone for all of us for the rest of our
lifetimes, and for our children's lifetimes.
The Forest Service was supposed to protect our forests, and
for generations they did.
[Chart.]
Mr. McClintock. And getting to Mr. Lamborn's point, I asked
our staff to chart the board feet harvested out of the Federal
forests and the acreage burned in our Federal forests. And this
goes back from 1962 to 2022. You see the blue bars here? That
is board feet harvested out of the national forests. The orange
bars, that is acreage burned. And there is nothing subtle about
this trend. It is dramatic.
And you are right, it may vary from year to year, but you
take a look at what has happened. As the Federal timber harvest
has dropped precipitously, acreage burned has grown
precipitously.
Mr. Moore. Yes.
Mr. McClintock. And we agree that about a quarter of those
forests have now been destroyed by these policies.
You and I both know that excess timber is going to come out
of that forest in only one of two ways. Either we are going to
carry it out or it is going to burn out. What do these charts
tell you?
Mr. Moore. Well, they don't tell me anything different than
what they are telling you. I mean, I don't think it is a big
secret we are not managing to the degree that our forests need.
We also don't have----
Mr. McClintock. And why aren't we? Because this is one of
the great ironies. You look at the private landowners. In
California, about half of the forests are privately owned. They
are kept in excellent condition, and the landowners make a lot
of money doing that. The Federal forests are absolutely
decrepit. Again, one quarter of them destroyed. Yet, we lose
money. What is the difference?
Mr. Moore. The difference, and you may or may not care to
hear this, but the difference is we don't have the resources to
manage the forests to the degree that they need to be managed.
Mr. McClintock. Well, we used to, and we used to do it for
a lot less. We used to make money harvesting this excess timber
out of the forests. Now it costs us money.
Mr. Moore. Yes.
Mr. McClintock. Not because of a lack of resources, but
because the laws that have been adopted in the 1970s make it
cost prohibitive for us to continue those sound forest
management practices. So, not a lot gets done. And until you
can acknowledge that, we are going to continue to have these
discussions and these disagreements, and we are going to
continue to watch our Federal forests die out and be burned
out.
I do want to compliment you on your administration of the
WIIN Act of 2016 that got a categorical exclusion from NEPA for
forest thinning projects under 10,000 acres. That was
administered in the Tahoe Basin under your leadership, and I
believe that that was exemplary. I have been trying to get
legislation to the Floor that will extend those policies
nationally. Would that help or hurt the cause of the forests?
Mr. Moore. Yes, Congresswoman McClintock, you and I go back
quite a ways. And one of the benefits that we have gotten from
some of your legislation was the 5,000-acre CE there on the
Tahoe area. And that was very beneficial in actually creating
and supporting an industry that was nearby.
So, there are opportunities to----
Mr. McClintock. I think it actually saved the city of South
Lake Tahoe from the Caldor Fire. It hit a treated tract under
that authority. The fire laid down, and firefighters were able
to put it out. But I am having a hell of a time getting that
onto the House Floor for a vote, despite the fact it came out
of this Committee with a somewhat bipartisan vote. And with
your experience with these policies, I would hope that we can
get that into law, but we have to overcome a problem here in
this House.
But thank you for being here today. Thank you for your work
all these years.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the
gentlelady from New Mexico for 5 minutes of questioning.
Ms. Stansbury. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chief Moore, thank you so much for being here with us
today. I am Melanie Stansbury. I represent New Mexico's 1st
Congressional District, which includes the Albuquerque area and
10 counties in central New Mexico.
I want to start by, first of all, saying thank you. We had
a fairly large wildfire break out in Lincoln County on the
southern tip of my district just 2 weeks ago. And your incident
command and all of the Forest Service guys who are out on the
ground have done just an exemplary job, and I wanted to commend
them and thank them for all of their work. In the early days of
that fire, there were some communication challenges with some
of the local residents, but your incident command got there,
and they now have it almost completely contained, folks are
back in their homes. So, I just want to say thank you.
Oftentimes, the Forest Service doesn't get their flowers
for the good work that they do, so we really appreciate it. And
I also want to say thank you to all the hotshot crews and
firefighters who are out there on the ground.
I am sure a lot of this has been covered this morning, but
obviously we are seeing a huge increase in both the number of
fires and intensity of fires. And in New Mexico, this is
certainly the case across the state. And the wildfire season is
shifting dramatically earlier. I mean, we are already having
fires across the state, and it is only May. And the questions I
wanted to ask today are really about community collaborations
with the Forest Service and resources that are available. And I
want to kind of ask them in two tranches.
One is about resources that are available to help
communities that want to engage in forest thinning and
treatments to help prevent fires, as well as some of the
challenges we are seeing working with utilities, especially
with climate change and how it is changing mitigation
activities.
So, if we could start talking about utilities, one of the
challenges that we are seeing in New Mexico is that the current
guidance, both from Forest Service and just the way in which
utilities have managed their power lines, and I know this is
true in California, as well, is that they had certain easements
and cutbacks in terms of how close the forest was allowed to
grow to the power lines. I believe it was 3 years ago we had
the McBride Fire in Lincoln County, where we had 90-mile-an-
hour winds, and we had a sapling that crossed with a power
line, and basically ignited a massive fire. And the utilities
were in the correct cutback zone, but with that kind of wind
intensity it still happened.
One of the things we are hearing, and I know this is a
problem across the West, is that utilities just don't have the
resources. And Forest Service, of course, is also strapped in
terms of manpower to get those mitigation easements cleaned up.
So, talk to us about what resources are available. In my
personal opinion, it is not acceptable to cut power to
communities for days at a time. And absent resources, that is
what our utilities are talking about doing. So, what is
available? How do we deal with this problem?
Mr. Moore. First of all, thank you for that question,
because we have been actively engaged with the utility industry
over the course of the last couple of years because we know
that that is a real critical area in the contributions to fire
or mitigation from fire.
Some of the things that we have done, and we started this
in California, where we have streamlined our processes so that
utility companies don't have to come and get permission every
time they do routine maintenance under their power lines. And
we have been doing that across the country over the last couple
of years, trying to see where and how we can streamline
processes so that we are not a limiting factor for treating
underneath those power lines.
The other issue, which we don't talk about too, though, is
the whole issue around liability. And it is something that is
there. We are going to have to have those tough conversations
around it. And there are no solutions right now, but that is
one of the biggest challenges that I see, particularly for the
small, rural cooperatives. They just don't have the ability
when fires strike.
So, it is a critical area for us. We have to look at that
because, just like you, I don't see any scenario where we are
not going to provide electricity to a lot of our rural users.
Ms. Stansbury. Yes. And at the end of the day, it is not
just a climate mitigation issue and a public safety issue. I
mean, this is people's lives on the line. We are talking about
in Lincoln County, for example, if they cut power to a
community like Ruidoso, we are talking hospitals, clinics. I
mean, this is going to actually impact real lives and the local
economy in this rural area.
The other piece I get asked all the time is that we have 23
Tribal Nations in New Mexico. They absolutely would like to
partner with the Forest Service to do forest treatments, but
are struggling to identify where the money is, how to engage in
those conversations. What part of the Forest Service is the
best point of contact to understand how to access these
infrastructure and IRA monies and those co-stewardship
agreements?
Mr. Moore. Well, typically, depending on the location, they
should be contacting the forest supervisor. And if that forest
supervisor is not available, I mean, the regional forester.
But my office, if you just can't get any help, for someone
like you, if you contact me or my office, that is another way
to get that pushed down.
But normally, if everything was working as it should be,
then our tribes should be working with the forest supervisor.
Ms. Stansbury. Excellent. Maybe a follow-up on this, and we
would love to engage with you all on this, is to ask your
forest supervisors at large to do more proactive engagement
with our tribes and consultation on funding resources
available.
Mr. Moore. Yes, Congresswoman, I don't know if you aware,
but we have developed a whole Tribal Action Plan, and a part of
that plan is to educate the entire workforce on tribal issues.
So, we have moved to make great strides in that area. In fact,
we have changed our State and Private Forestry name to State,
Private and Tribal. And we are making tremendous strides in
trying to improve the relationships with a lot of our tribal
communities.
Ms. Stansbury. Excellent. Well, I think at the end of the
day, it really comes down----
Mr. Tiffany. The gentlelady's time has expired.
Ms. Stansbury. Oh, I am just going to wrap up my sentence.
We would love to engage with you on that issue. It is
really important to our Tribal Nations.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it.
Mr. Tiffany. You are welcome for the extra time.
I would like to recognize the gentleman from Oregon for 5
minutes.
Mr. Bentz. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
And thank you, Chief, for being here today. I also want to
thank you for the prompt response to my concern raised at our
last meeting regarding the tribal stewardship contracts out in
Oregon. And there was a prompt reaching out, and we very much
appreciate that.
Also, I want to give a shout out to Merv George for his
work. It has been excellent, and we are very appreciative of
his work and yours in putting together the memorandum of
understanding on allowing private parties to suppress fires on
Federal land in Oregon. That is hugely important, given the
checkerboard nature of which you are all too familiar with of
that land. So, perhaps a comment of why you supported the MOU
that allows private parties to go on Federal land and put out
fires.
Mr. Moore. One of the things that we want to do is bring
the community into the decision space on some of the things
that are taking place. No one cares about the community better
than the people that live in those communities, so bringing
them to the table and not just to get their opinion, but also
giving them decision space, it is the right thing to do, and it
is the necessary thing to do.
And what we are finding, by bringing the community into
discussion, is that we are getting better-supported solutions.
And that is one of the solutions. You may or may not be
familiar with what just happened yesterday in the Bend area,
having a tentative agreement on the homeless issue there. And I
would say that just having a lot of different entities engaged
in solutions and discovering solutions has really been a win-
win for everyone.
Mr. Bentz. Well, we hope for that outcome in and around
Bend, for sure. It has been a long time coming. But yay.
Let's talk about the amount that people are being paid
right now to fight fires. And one of the situations that has
occurred is that the people actually that are contracting have
had pay increases imposed upon them for $10 an hour, I think,
for those that are out fighting fire. But that $10 did not
extend to the folks who had been there longer. And as a result,
what we have are people at the lower end of the pay scale
getting a $10-an-hour increase, but people at the higher level,
no. And that is creating incredible difficulties.
My understanding is that you folks have been working on
this, but there has been no resolution. Can you bring us up to
date on how this is----
Mr. Moore. Are you talking about the pay bump that the
firefighters got?
Mr. Bentz. Yes.
Mr. Moore. There was actually a $20,000 pay bump for GS-10s
and below. And a part of that was to get at the issue around
retention that we were having across the agency. And the other
thing is that we had to do this because you could work at a
fast food restaurant and make more than a number of our
firefighters were making----
Mr. Bentz. Right, I don't think I am talking about Federal
employees. I think I am talking about contract employees that
are working for people who are contracting to do firefighting.
Mr. Moore. Yes, I am not familiar with that. I know we are
required on the Davis-Bacon Act to pay appropriate wages. I
would be happy to follow up with you to get more specifics on
that particular issue.
Mr. Bentz. Please, if you would, we would very much
appreciate that.
Mr. Moore. OK.
Mr. Bentz. Also, there has been an issue raised that has to
do with the nature of Forest Service contracting when it comes
to going for the cheapest possible bid as opposed to the more
quality, experienced, long-term contracts. And this is a
decision made inside the Forest Service. And the result has
been perhaps less money paid out, but perhaps not the quality
of the project being done that all of us want. Can you talk
about that for a moment?
Mr. Moore. Yes. You may be talking about getting the
cheapest bid, or the best value bid would be another way. And
we have been looking at exploring the best value-type
contracts, because it gives a local contractor an opportunity
to win a number of those contracts.
Here again, if I had specifics on specific contracts, I can
give you a specific response or answer. And I would be happy to
follow up with you.
Mr. Bentz. No, thank you for that, and we will get you
those specific instances of where long-term folks who have been
doing the job quite well suddenly are being outbid by people
that come in from goodness knows where, and the job that gets
done is not what you, I think, or I would want from a quality
standpoint.
My last question has to do with the success of the
categorical exclusion as a device to get us into the woods.
What is your comment? What is your thought? Should we be, as
the Congressman from California suggested, expanding upon the
CEs?
Mr. Moore. Yes, as a matter of fact, I have looked at the
NEPA that we use across the country, and about 87 percent of
our NEPA is done through CEs, and that is about 1,134 CEs that
we have used, as opposed to about 150 EAs and about 7 EISs.
Mr. Bentz. Thank you so much.
I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields. I would now like to
recognize the gentlelady from New Mexico, Ms. Leger Fernandez.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you.
Mr. Tiffany. For 5 minutes.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you very much, and thank you,
Chief Moore. We talk often.
And I really want to thank you for advocating for
comprehensive pay, the $20,000 bump you just talked about for
housing, because we need to make sure that our forest fighters
and the people who not just fight the forests, but who care for
the forests have housing, addressing mental health, and the
well-being of our Federal firefighters. Those of us who live
among the forests and play among the forests know the hard work
that they do and the sacrifices that they endure on behalf of
the communities and those firefighters, and they are often from
those communities, and I think that that is really key.
I also want to thank the heroic men and women who are
presently fighting the Indios wildfire in my district. As you
know, we have several wildfires going in New Mexico.
And I was struck by the fact that in 2022, Congress
appropriated $10.8 billion to the Forest Service. Is that
correct?
Mr. Moore. Through the BIL and IRA, you mean?
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Yes.
Mr. Moore. Yes, that is right.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. And then, according to your written
testimony, that same year the Forest Service contributed $44.3
billion to our country's GDP. So, we invested $10.8 billion in
the Forest Service, we got 400 percent back as a return on
investment. And I think that that is really important for us to
think about when we are thinking about these budgets, is that
we are investing, that they are investments. They are not
something that goes away, they are not frivolous. It is not
waste. They are investments, and they are giving us a
tremendous return.
Now, when you are thinking about investments, though,
because of Republican cuts you are operating on an $8.2 billion
budget, and that is a 25 percent cut from 2022. Correct?
Mr. Moore. Right.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. So, I think we go back to that we have
to invest in those places that protect us and those places that
generate the kind of revenue we are talking about.
But I want to go to something that maybe might be seen by
some as small, but by the communities that are impacted, it is
very large, and that is cemeteries. It is my understanding that
if a cemetery is on Forest Service land and a community would
like to have that cemetery returned to them, the Forest Service
must go through an expensive process of evaluation: is there a
reason for transferring it, is there authority, what is the
dollar value? And there is a long, bureaucratic process for
transferring back to a community a place where they have buried
their ancestors, where you know you are not going to do
anything else with that cemetery because it is hallowed ground.
Is that right?
Mr. Moore. Yes, that is something that we should really
talk more about because you are right, we are not going to do
any kind of management activities on those lands. And as you
know, too, we are required to follow laws and procedures, but I
think we would be willing to sit down and see what would be a
wonderful solution to this issue that you are bringing up.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Right. I think an amendment to the
Small Tracts Act, so we will look forward to working with you
on that because I think anybody around this rotunda would
recognize that that is something that we are going to need to
transfer back to those people whose ancestors are there.
The other thing, Chief Moore, I think the first time you
and I spoke was after the first fire that the Forest Service
started in New Mexico that got out of control, and I know you
did a review, but we also asked for a Government Accountability
Office review, a GAO review. That is now coming to completion.
And while I welcome what you have done in yours, I think it
was essential that we have that independent look that looked at
all fires because we started with that one, and then we had a
second one where you walked away from the campfire, as I call
it. Nobody should walk away from the campfire. So, you haven't
seen the report yet, but I think I am going to be asking you
for a commitment to implement what the GAO has identified. Can
you give me that commitment?
Mr. Moore. Yes. In fact, I would be really interested in
seeing what the GAO report has.
As you may recall, right after that Hermits Peak Calf
Canyon Fire, I called a 90-day pause on all prescribed burns
across the agency. And in that process, we looked at all of our
prescribed burning, and we made some recommendations that we
are living by today in that.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Well, we are not living by all of the
recommendations, or not living by everything that you have
committed to me. I mean, we need to really make sure that the
drones and the infrared technology is being deployed for
prescribed burns. There are some things that we need to get
done. And in your initial report following Hermits Peak, there
were a lot of issues, and ``Oh, but we did everything right,''
and it is like you had a whole list of issues that were done
wrong. So, I think we need to be careful, because sometimes you
have wanted to have it both ways. We are going to be doing
this, but also then not truly, truly owning the mistakes that
were made.
So, hopefully, the GAO report will give us new insight, and
hopefully you will be willing to make sure they get
implemented.
Mr. Moore. Yes, and I can give you an example of it. I know
you are real big on the use of drones to monitor fires. And we
have committed to using drones where necessary and when
necessary.
One of the challenges that we really have from drones is
that we have a requirement that we cannot use drones with
Chinese products in them. And a drone without that, in many
cases, it costs us $80,000 for each one, as opposed to a much
cheaper drone using other types. So, we have to work that out
from a budget standpoint, as well.
But we are working on that. We are committed to it, and we
know that the technology is rapidly changing every day. And
while we may not have that opportunity now, we think that in
the future, because of the development of the technology, we
would be able to use that going into the future.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Right. Well, the Biden administration
has been real big on making sure that we bring manufacturing
back home.
But we have gone over our time. These New Mexican women, we
just want to have long conversations, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Tiffany. No comment.
[Laughter.]
Ms. Leger Fernandez. I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. I would just gently chide my colleague from
New Mexico in regards to the Republicans reducing funding in
the latest appropriations bill for the U.S. Forest Service.
Take a look at the number of people on the other side of the
aisle that voted for that bill that reduces funding.
I recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. LaMalfa, for
5 minutes.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the
opportunity.
Thank you, Chief Moore, for appearing today. We go back a
long way, don't we?
Mr. Moore. We do.
Mr. LaMalfa. To the West. So, let's talk about the harvest
numbers for a moment here. I would like to understand better
how you are arriving at a 30 percent increase over, how many
years was it, 20?
Mr. Moore. Yes, the last 20 years.
Mr. LaMalfa. Because with the chart I have, the information
and the trend seems to be over a much longer period of time,
where harvest being these olive-colored ones here, going from
this is still the late 1980s right here, 12 billion board feet
down to the low of about 2002. So, if you start at 2002 and
trend up from there, you could see a slight increase, but a
fairly flat one in board feet, but a dramatic drop-off from
here. And then doggone it, it coincides with acres burned,
vastly increasing at that point, too, as we have suffered so
much in the West especially on that.
So, I would like to understand how you are arriving at
board feet harvested, is that the terminology you would like to
use on that?
Mr. Moore. Sold, board feet sold.
Mr. LaMalfa. Sold, sold. So, does that mean it is
delivered?
Mr. Moore. That means it is sold. I will give you an
example. And we can break it down by each area.
Mr. LaMalfa. Well, time is short, and I am not going to get
New Mexico time, probably. But board feet sold versus actually
delivered. I want to know how many feet are coming out of the
forests in marketable timber, lumber.
Mr. Moore. Well, that was it. I mean, our target this year
is 3.2 billion board feet.
Mr. LaMalfa. Which is a lower number than last year, yet
there is projected to be a lower number for following years.
But we had these huge numbers years ago.
Mr. Moore. Well, it is more than what we actually achieved
last year.
Mr. LaMalfa. Achieved, yes, but you fell short of the goal
by about a quarter billion board feet of last year's goal.
Mr. Moore. Yes, there is a lot that is not being brought up
in this conversation, so I----
Mr. LaMalfa. And it is tough, 5 minutes at a time here. But
when you talked about litigation a bit earlier stopping you
from hitting that goal by a quarter billion feet. Just an idea,
I am not trying to be mean here, but why wouldn't you open more
bids so that you have more being litigated at the same time,
and more of them actually fall through the hole and make it,
and then reach the number?
Mr. Moore. Well, that would be an approach, Congressman,
but that is not the one that we are choosing to do, simply
because we don't have----
Mr. LaMalfa. Why don't you choose to do more? Because we
are suffering out here.
Mr. Moore. We don't have the ability to do more than what
we are currently doing----
Mr. LaMalfa. You just had a massive influx of money here
from the IRA recently. They told us at a hearing in Spearfish,
South Dakota, they said, ``We have more money right now than we
have ever had.'' Yet, they still wanted $20 million more to do
a project there that the Nyman Company needed. They have just
laid off 50 workers there at their plant in Spearfish because
they can't keep up. They can't get out in the forest enough to
do, they need about 120 million board feet to do the job. And
as of March, they only had 10 million over the whole year. So,
they have since subsequently laid off 50 people there. We have
lost 50 mills in the last 18 months or 15 months or so. I don't
know where the infrastructure is going to be to process what it
is the output is.
Let me ask a number from you here. If we are putting out
3.1 to 3.4 billion, how many board feet are being grown in your
forest in a year? How much are the trees just out there growing
per year?
Mr. Moore. There were about three or four questions there,
so----
Mr. LaMalfa. Well, just the one. How many board feet are
you growing on your 193 million acres, do you think, annually?
Mr. Moore. Well, how I am going to answer you is that there
are different ways to look at that. And I know some of your
friends in the industry are giving you a number. They are
looking at----
Mr. LaMalfa. I don't have a number off the top of my head.
No one has given me a number. I am asking you, sir.
Mr. Moore. Well, we are cutting below the ASQ, if I looked
at all the plans across the country. And we are cutting that
below ASQ because we don't have the resources to cut more than
what we are currently cutting.
Mr. LaMalfa. Do you think we are growing about 6 billion
board feet per year out in our forests, maybe?
Mr. Moore. I can't give you that with any confidence.
Mr. LaMalfa. It has to be in that ballpark, 5 to 6 billion.
But we are cutting 3, 3\1/2\ as a goal. So, over a period of
time, how are we going to ever keep up with the amount of board
feet that are growing and the density we are talking about?
Ms. Stansbury was talking about the power lines a little
bit, and I hope people can support the farm bill because I have
a piece in there to expand the gap between power lines and the
forests from 10 feet to 50 feet, and we had to pass a law in
2018 to direct your agency to be more timely in getting permits
out to take hazardous trees.
And we are trying to build upon that because 10 feet is not
a lot when the power line is shorter than the trees next to it.
I would like it even wider than 50, if you want to take it,
because, as Ms. Stansbury said, we are shutting down people's
power. Like in Tehama County, sometimes I drive through there
in the past, and the whole county is shut off at night in
Northern California because the wind might blow in this first-
world country and cause a power line problem.
So, we need a lot better output on board feet taken because
it is not keeping up. And I would certainly like to hear more
about your numbers on how you come up with that trend over the
20, 30 years versus an actual decrease in what you are
expecting to do the next 2 years with 200 million board feet.
Let me close on the idea that you are trying to free up
$1.36 billion to take it into emergency spending, which means a
lot more discretionary. Do you intend to purchase electric
vehicles with this freed-up money that is going to be in your
main budget now?
Mr. Moore. I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised if we
do purchase some electric vehicles.
Mr. LaMalfa. Will that be in the forest, or will they be
running around in DC with those?
Mr. Moore. Congressman, I understand your position on this.
Mr. LaMalfa. No, I am just asking the question, though. Are
you going to buy a bunch of electric vehicles?
Mr. Moore. Well, the other thing that we are trying to do
to complement that is also look at electric plug-in spots on
some of our campgrounds so that the people that do have
electric vehicles can plug in while they are out visiting the
recreation.
Mr. LaMalfa. But we don't have enough money to help the
Spearfish, South Dakota to be able to get their timber harvest
done.
I had better yield back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
Mr. Tiffany. We are off New Mexico time now. I would like
to recognize the gentleman from Utah.
Mr. Curtis. Thank you.
Mr. Tiffany. And before you start, Mr. Curtis, the Chief
has agreed that we are going to evaluate these numbers that are
being put out. We are seeing some discrepancies. And we are
going to work together with the Chairman of the Full Committee
and others to match our numbers up, and see exactly where we
stand. And I really appreciate the Chief and his willingness to
be able to do that.
Mr. Curtis.
Mr. Curtis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chief, thank you for being with us. I don't know how
familiar you are with Utah. Have you ever been to Utah?
Mr. Moore. Lots of times.
Mr. Curtis. Two-thirds of the land in Utah is owned by the
Federal Government. I have parts of my district that are 90
percent. So, you can see right off, if we are not getting the
help and the coordination that we need from the Federal
Government we are literally shut down as a state. And I would
like to bring up some specifics with you today.
As part of this experience in Utah and these amazing
recreational areas, we are very dependent on local guides who
can provide education, who can provide safety as people go into
these areas. You can see sometimes if people go into these
areas by themselves, it is hugely problematic. Yet, our local
guides are experiencing great frustration, as am I, in their
ability to get permits to do that. And my office has been
working with the leadership of the Salt Lake Ranger District to
address primarily two issues: first, the refusal to turn
temporary permits into long-term priority use permits; and more
recently, the termination of access to the Lone Peak Wilderness
Area, where guides have been going for decades, and was
recently reaffirmed in the 2022 permits, as is consistent with
the management plan.
Yet, frankly, I am frustrated, they are frustrated, and I
have sent you a detailed letter which I would like to enter
into the record that explains the situation.
Mr. Tiffany. Without objection, so ordered.

Congress of the United States

Washington, DC

June 3, 2024

Thomas J. Vilsack, Secretary
US Department of Agriculture
1400 Independence Ave SW
Washington, DC 20250

Re: Outfitter and Guide Permits on the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National
Forest

Dear Secretary Vilsack:

We write today with serious concerns regarding the management of
outfitter and guide permits on the Salt Lake Ranger District (SLRD) of
the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest (UWCNF). For many years, there
have been unnecessary limitations imposed on outfitters and guides
seeking to operate in this Ranger District. Before Members of Congress
became involved several years ago, the guides themselves made lengthy
and sincere efforts to address these issues with the Supervisor of this
forest, David Whittekiend. I enclose attached documentation of those
efforts with this correspondence. We write you today because the SLRD
has continued to limit access to the Forest. Most recently, the SLRD
instituted an unnecessary moratorium on temporary permit holders in the
Lone Peak Wilderness, which will also apply to priority permit holders
at permit renewal. Furthermore, the SLRD has declined to take steps to
issue long-term permits that would resolve many of these issues.
While Members of Congress and guides have tried to work with the
SLRD, we regret that none of the solutions suggested have met with Mr.
Whittekiend's approval. On the one occasion the Supervisor did agree to
Congressman Curtis's request to rescind the termination of all
temporary guide and outfitter permits last year, he subsequently
revoked the guides' and outfitters' access to the Lone Peak Wilderness
area where guides have worked for decades. The explanation provided by
the Supervisor contradicted his own decision to allow guiding in this
area just two years prior. The fact that the Supervisor revoked and
then reinstated access to this area in 2022, and is now doing so again,
causes confusion among the public and the guides, interferes with
public access to education and safety leadership, and disrupts the
activities of hard-working local business owners and their employees.
The guides and outfitters who serve the public through your permit
system are instrumental in providing access to forest lands for people
who are not able to visit on their own, whether due to a lack of
experience, skills, or equipment. It is important to remember these
people are part of the public we serve, and the public deserves an
opportunity to experience their public lands with the assistance of a
guide. The guides also promote safety education and Leave No Trace
practices which directly support the goals of the US Forest Service.
Uneducated visitors in a dangerous backcountry environment are a threat
to themselves and others, potentially straining search and rescue
resources.
The two primary concerns that have arisen in the last year involve:
(1) the revocation of access to the Lone Peak Wilderness area, which
has been available to guides for decades prior, and (2) the ongoing
lack of long-term priority use permits. The reasons given for both
actions appear vacuous and contradictory.
The basis provided for the inability to issue long-term permits (at
an in-person meeting with the forest service supervisor, his staff,
Congressman Curtis and his staff, and several guides and outfitters on
November 21, 2023) was lack of personnel. Implementing more long-term
permits would considerably alleviate the workload for agency staff (and
guides) by reducing the frequency of permit renewals from every six
months to every 10 years. The group pointed out that the Forest Service
Enterprise Program was created to assist local staff with projects such
as the development of long-term permit opportunities (see https://
www.fs.usda.gov/enterprise/skills-and-services.php). The group
questioned why permanent priority permits were not forthcoming to save
the extra work associated with the reissuance of temporary permits each
year and pointed to the Enterprise Program as a potential resource to
develop long-term permits. Nothing was accepted as a satisfactory
resolution. Only after Congressman Curtis described the Supervisor's
position as unacceptable did Mr. Whittekiend indicate he would consider
alternatives, including assuring Congressman Curtis he would work
toward the development of more long-term priority permit opportunities
for the temporary permittees.
Also of great concern, when winter season temporary permits were
issued in January of this year, approximately 8 weeks after the
November 21 meeting, the permits unexpectedly excluded the Lone Peak
Wilderness. This came as a great shock to the guides, to us, and the to
the public. Outfitting and guiding activities have occurred in this
wilderness area for decades, and for good reason--there are highly
desirable climbing, skiing, hiking, and camping opportunities that the
public wishes to experience with the expertise of a guide. The guides'
and outfitters' dismay at this development is unsurprising, as this
issue was reviewed and addressed in 2022 when access had previously
been revoked, then reinstated. The 2022 Letter To File (attached),
interpreting the 2003 Wasatch-Cache Land and Resource Management Plan,
states:

Given our reliance on outfitting and guiding companies to
provide the valuable educational services to the public, the
increased use of climbing areas in wilderness, and the
increased visitation of recreational visitors in the Salt Lake
Ranger District, it appears to be contradictory to limit
outfitter and guiding companies if the desired future condition
is to have a well-educated public that uses National Forest
system lands. (emphasis added).

This language shows that in 2022 the Supervisor recognized that
outfitters and guides are important for educating the public,
particularly as more people visit the forest. Nothing has changed since
2022 to warrant this change in position. Congressman Curtis wrote a
letter to Mr. Whittekiend requesting that he follow his prior 2022
interpretation and remove the prohibition on outfitting and guiding in
the SLRD Lone Peak Wilderness (see letter of March 28, 2024),
attached). Mr. Whittekiend refused, and specifically blamed Congressman
Curtis's prior request as part of the basis for this new decision.
``This approach was necessary to expedite the request by your office
and local outfitter and guides to issue winter temporary outfitter and
guiding permits.''
Learning to innovate and be creative in solving challenges is
something we do well in Utah and which this local office seems to
resist. We, the Utah delegation, would appreciate any assistance your
office can provide in reinstating outfitting and guiding access to the
Lone Peak Wilderness and taking steps toward the development of long-
term outfitting and guiding permits on the Salt Lake Ranger District.
Thank you for your attention to these very important issues.

Sincerely,

______

Mr. Curtis. Thank you. The Utah Wasatch-Cache National
Forest has been unwilling to work with us on finding creative
ways to meet the needs for more priority permit holders, as
opposed to temporary permit holders. Every time we meet with
the Supervisor, there is a half-hearted attempt to address the
limitations imposed on guides. However, a few weeks later those
promises are unfulfilled and we are actually further away than
when we started. That feels very punitive, and you can imagine
how my constituents feel about that who are dependent on a
living and provide a service to these people.
For example, after reluctantly agreeing not to terminate
all temporary guide and outfitter permits last year, only after
a personal plea from me and meeting with them, the Supervisor
subsequently revoked their access to the Lone Peak Wilderness
Area, even though he told me he wouldn't. This has led to this
amazing frustration, and I regret that we couldn't resolve this
with this local office and I have to bring it here in a public
manner to you, but I don't know what else to do.
So, my question is, will you take immediate steps to
provide more long-term outfitting and guiding permits in the
Salt Lake Ranger District?
Mr. Moore. Yes, Vice Chairman, I just recently became aware
of this very issue that you are bringing up here and the letter
that you sent to the Secretary. But the short answer is yes, of
course. I want to work with you on a solution to this.
Mr. Curtis. OK. If it is, and listen, I get it, a lack of
resources, I can't imagine what the people out in the field are
asked to deal with, with the lack of resources. Can we get the
resources needed into this district so these permits can be
issued?
Mr. Moore. Will you allow me to take a look at this issue,
get with the region and the forest so that I have a better
understanding of what is really going on?
But I will commit to you that I will work for a solution.
Mr. Curtis. Thank you. I will take you up on that, and
would love to work with you personally. You can see how
important this is, right? We have these access areas. If we
don't have the guides, people go in by themselves. We end up
costing more resources than otherwise. And this is a livelihood
for many people in our state. That is very, very important. And
when they get an answer and then it changes, you can see the
frustration that we have.
Mr. Moore. Sure.
Mr. Curtis. Thank you. I would like to bring up another
issue.
Not far from there is the Black Hawk Campground. In 2018,
there was a serious fire up in Payson Canyon. It destroyed the
campground, unfortunately. It was a very popular campground. It
took a lot of pressure off other areas because of this
campground. Also because of a lack of resources this campground
has not been reopened since 2018.
Likewise, I will just tell you, as I met with local
officials in the area last week they told me there is a sense
that the Forest Service is actually intentionally gradually
shutting down more and more access. And by not reopening this
campground, it plays into that narrative. The people on the
ground are willing to volunteer. They are willing to bring
local resources to get this campground back open.
Likewise, will you work with me to figure out how we can
get this campground back open?
Mr. Moore. Yes, I will work with you on that.
Mr. Curtis. Thank you. I can't ask for anything more than
that, and I appreciate your attention to these very important
issues.
Mr. Moore. Thank you.
Mr. Curtis. Thank you. I yield my time.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields, and I will turn to the
Chairman of the Full Committee, Mr. Westerman, for his
questioning.
Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Chairman Tiffany.
Thank you again, Chief Moore, for being here today.
I think you and I agree on a lot of things in your
testimony. In your written testimony, you use the word
``access'' 10 times, and I have said that we need to practice
conservation through access.
I was intrigued by the very similar graphs that Mr.
McClintock and Mr. LaMalfa put up that showed the harvest
levels and the amount of forest fires, and how there was an
inflection point. And I think we both agree that we want to see
more management done on the forests to keep them healthy.
So, if we go back to where that inflection point was, it
was in the 1980s and really in the 1990s where we quit
harvesting, and the amount of forest fires started increasing.
But if you look at the specific policies that happened then, in
the West you had the spotted owl controversy. And the idea was
we are going to stop harvesting and we are going to save the
spotted owl. Can you tell me what is happening to spotted owl
populations in the West since that policy went in place?
Mr. Moore. Well, I think, according to my knowledge, they
have continued to decline.
Mr. Westerman. At about 4 percent per year is what I have
read. So, the policy hasn't worked to save the spotted owl, and
we can, in hindsight, decades and decades later, look back and
say this was a weaponized rule just to stop management on the
forests, which was really a bad idea for the species and for
the forests, as well.
There was also another rule, and I emphasize the word
``rule,'' not a law, put in place by Congress called the
Roadless Rule. And I was visiting with folks from Finland the
other day, and they were talking about how much pride they take
in building roads and having access into their forests so they
can manage better. And they were just befuddled by the idea
that we build roads and then tear them out, which is a huge
cost. And it is also a way to deny access when we put roads in
and take them out.
How critical are roads to doing not only management, but
creating firebreaks and being able to get crews in to do fire
suppression when needed? How critical are roads to that?
Mr. Moore. Well, I mean, yes, they are necessary, critical.
Mr. Westerman. Yes. And if we don't have roads, we end up
spending a lot of money with tankers dropping fire retardants.
And it just seems like we made some really bad decisions
three or four decades ago that are really costing us on the
backside right now.
I have a lot of U.S. Forest Service land in my district,
and I have always defended the Forest Service because I think
the management on the Ouachita and the Ozark is as good as
anywhere in the country, although there is room for
improvement.
In Montgomery County in my district, about 85 percent of
the forests are Forest Service lands. I held a mobile office
there a few weeks ago. Twenty-five people came in, and their
issue was access on the Forest Service land. Some of them had
been given tickets for riding down roads that were closed that
they didn't know were closed, and then roads being closed off.
So, in what world does it make sense that we don't create
more access into these forests, and that we don't leave the
roads in place after we go in and do management?
I have seen it firsthand, a lot of money spent building a
road, you go in and do the management, and then a lot of money
spent tearing the road out and trying to return it back. Does
that really make sense to do that?
Mr. Moore. Well, I think some of the logic around that,
whether we can agree on that or not, and I don't know the
specific reason, but sometimes we build spec roads so that the
timber industry that won the bid can go in and remove the
timber, and when they are done with it, then we put the road to
bed, we close it. I don't know if that is the situation there
that you are referring to, but that has been somewhat of a
common practice.
Mr. Westerman. Yes, these are roads that have been open for
a long time. And it is the No. 1 complaint I hear on the
forests in my district are people have access denied to go on
these roads.
There is a crazy rule where you can drive a log truck or a
passenger vehicle, but you can't drive an ATV down these roads,
and that just doesn't make sense to the general public when
things like that happen.
So, I would hope that we would take another look at roads
and access on the forests, and use some common sense there. It
seems to me like it would be a huge benefit to the Forest
Service, as far as public relations go, when you don't have
Members of Congress' constituents calling them all the time,
saying, ``Why is the Forest Service doing this crazy rule? Is
it their job to keep taxpaying Americans off of the public
land?'' Because that is how they see it.
With that, I will yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields, and I am going to take a
few minutes here for questioning. And I want to piggyback on
what the Chairman was just asking there.
We just had that field hearing, as you know, Chief Moore,
up in Hayward, Wisconsin in regards to access, and heard some
very good stories. Currently, the Forest Service is
decommissioning an average of 2,000 miles of road annually. Is
that accurate?
Mr. Moore. I don't have that information available, but I
wouldn't be surprised by it, sir.
Mr. Tiffany. Yes, I think that number is, I mean, think
about that. That is 2,000 miles annually that are being reduced
for access.
And to the Chairman's point, sometimes that road that is
built to high specifications, when it is removed, it is removed
at the cost to the contractor. So, the contractor is having to
reduce their bid as a result of having to pay for the cost of
removing the road. So, the Federal Treasury actually ends up
with less money as a result of that.
And it goes back to what the Chairman was saying, is that
it just doesn't make sense to the public, and especially many
of them don't know what I just shared with you in regards to
the road removal. But when they hear it, they just go, duh, why
are we doing these things?
So, I guess my question is, this is a growing problem in
regards to access. Will you commit to working with us to bring
more access to the public?
Mr. Moore. Mr. Chairman, yes, I want to be able to work
with you and all of our public on access. I also want you to be
able to understand the challenges that we have, too, because
sometimes we can bring up individual pieces from a common-sense
standpoint, why are we doing this?
Let me just share with you, though, as I look across the
agency and what we are being asked to do. We are being asked to
manage a road system of about 371,000 miles. And in that
371,000 miles of roads, we are only funded at about 25 percent
to do that. I don't want to close roads, and yet I am not
funded to maintain the road system that we currently have. So,
it is a real dilemma for us in the Forest Service to be able to
do that.
So, I am not surprised. I am disappointed that we have some
common-sense kinds of things that we can't come to an
agreement, and I want to work on those types of things.
Mr. Tiffany. I would just share with you that I think there
are people locally that are willing to help in regards to this.
I think there needs to be greater engagement in that regard,
because that is what we heard at the hearing, is that there are
people, including private individuals, that are willing to help
out in this process to be able to make this happen.
The other thing is that some would say that the Forest
Service is far too passive in pushing back against those who
want to put the restrictions in place. In fact, in the Forest
Service, you have a broad range of ideologies, but there are
some in the Forest Service that actually want to see greater
restrictions. And that is where your leadership is valued so
much is to be able to cut through that, where somebody's
personal beliefs enter into public decision-making.
Mr. Moore. Yes, but Mr. Chairman, let's take a look at
that.
Mr. Tiffany. Do you want us to report the employees that
aren't----
Mr. Moore. No, I want to be able to go out on that road
that you are talking about, and let's see what is possible
talking with some of the public there.
Mr. Tiffany. OK. We will invite you up to meet my good
friend, Senator Rob Stafsholt, and he will give you a tour,
just as we had.
Mr. Moore. Great.
Mr. Tiffany. So, yes, let's see if we can do that.
And by the way, I want to thank--your staff in Wisconsin
was there, Director Youngblood, and we really appreciate that
she attended that access hearing.
So, the 2025 budget requests $124 million for new land
acquisitions. Is that a good idea with a backlog of
maintenance?
Mr. Moore. Well, here again, let's look at the specifics of
what has been requested, because sometimes land acquisition is
for better access to the public lands. Sometimes it is for more
efficient management.
So, without knowing these specifics of a particular area, I
would say there are different reasons for it.
Mr. Tiffany. Yes, I think with the maintenance backlog that
is going on, I mean, it should be a very high bar that we will
be adding to the Federal estate at this point when we hear that
there is this whole maintenance backlog. How much more money do
you need?
Mr. Moore. Well, if you doubled our budget right now, Mr.
Chairman, we would certainly make that work, but it wouldn't be
enough to do everything that is being asked. That is how
underfunded--and I just gave you an example, it was a 371,000-
mile road system, and we are only funded at 25 percent of it.
Mr. Tiffany. So, doubling the road budget would
accomplish----
Mr. Moore. Well, another example, because I can give you a
specific number, but in general, when I look at the deferred
maintenance backlog of over $8 billion, $5.45 billion of that
is for roads, bridges, and dams. So, there is a lot of work to
be done out there, and we are just not funded even to maintain
the system that we have.
Mr. Tiffany. Looking at those charts, two of them that you
saw earlier over to my right, isn't that one of the ways that
we could get there, is to harvest more wood?
Mr. Moore. Well, yes, there is no silver bullet, so to
speak. But yes, I mean, there are a lot of different ways to
help us get there.
Mr. Tiffany. In your testimony, you referred to green jobs,
amongst other things that are benefits. What is a green job?
Mr. Moore. Well, I don't know that I use that very much,
but a green job is one of those jobs that I think is going to
be working with the environment to keep it healthy and
resilient.
Mr. Tiffany. It was a recommendation that you put ``green
job'' in your testimony, I take it. You don't have to answer
that question. That is fine.
What is old growth?
Mr. Moore. Well, it depends on the species in terms of how
you define that. But I think, in general, it is large, older
trees.
Mr. Tiffany. Is it defined?
Mr. Moore. Yes, it is defined by species, but basically,
just for simple language, it is the older trees that we have in
the forests.
Mr. Tiffany. So, in an executive summary here that comes
from both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management,
it says the terms ``old growth forest'' and ``mature forest''
have not been consistently defined. Would you agree with that
characterization?
Mr. Moore. Yes, I would.
Mr. Tiffany. Because just this past week, some constituents
up in my district posed that question to staff, and they did
not have an answer, similar to what you are saying here. It is
not defined, correct?
Mr. Moore. I say it is defined by different species.
Different species have different age classes of what is
considered old growth.
Mr. Tiffany. But it is not defined, as it says in----
Mr. Moore. Yes, just trying to keep it simple, there is no
agreed-upon, I think, generally agreed-upon definition, other
than if you look at it by species, which varies.
Mr. Tiffany. I think the Biden administration came out with
a Land Management Plan Direction for Old Growth Forest
Conditions across the National Forest System. Are you familiar
with that?
Mr. Moore. I am.
Mr. Tiffany. And the Forest Service is considering amending
128 Land Management Plans, is that right?
Mr. Moore. That is correct, yes.
Mr. Tiffany. And doing it through a single EIS?
Mr. Moore. You mean for old growth?
Mr. Tiffany. Yes.
Mr. Moore. Yes.
Mr. Tiffany. Is that consistent with the law, to amend
those 128 Land Management Plans, individual Land Management
Plans, with one EIS?
Mr. Moore. Yes. I mean, obviously, we can do that. But you
have to amend all 128 plans.
Right now, one of the bigger challenges we have with old
growth is there is no consistent way of how we manage old
growth. So, this Forest Plan amendment is to come up with a
framework for how we manage old growth, but also leave
flexibility at the local level to make some decisions in how it
is managed.
Mr. Tiffany. Are you familiar with the 2012 Planning Rule?
Mr. Moore. I used to be. Somewhat still.
Mr. Tiffany. Yes. I mean, it rings a bell, right? I am not
asking you for specifics here, trying to trap you, anything
like that.
It says here among the 2012 rule's purposes was to provide
for a transparent, coordinated process. Whereas, with what is
being proposed with this old growth Land Management Plan, it
says the Forest Service's willingness is to now convert its
commitment to a transparent, collaborative process. Isn't there
a distinction between collaboration and coordination?
Mr. Moore. I mean, I think, generally, yes.
Mr. Tiffany. I mean, isn't coordination identified in the
law, that it is a specific process in working with local
municipalities?
Mr. Moore. Yes, it is about informing and being informed.
Mr. Tiffany. So, if 128 Land Management Plans are done
under one EIS, how are you going to coordinate with all those
local municipalities?
Mr. Moore. Well, it is going to be done at the local
individual forest level. Our approach is we basically
overhauled the whole planning process within the agency. So, we
have three planning teams across the country: one in the West,
one in the Midwest, and one in the East. And these teams will
be doing most of the legwork on the analysis.
And a part of the issue we have had in the agency, too, is
that you don't have the skill set at every forest to do this,
and there is so much other work to be done. So, these national
teams or these regional teams will take most of the brunt of
the work from the forest, so they are not overly encumbered
with a forest plan revision.
Mr. Tiffany. Let's take one, for example, the Chequamegon-
Nicolet National Forest in Wisconsin. Do you fully commit to
coordinate with local units of government when creating this
new plan?
Mr. Moore. Yes, that is an ordinary part of what we should
be doing out there, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Tiffany. Well, those folks are ready, willing, and able
to work with you in regards to this, and I appreciate you
making that commitment.
And now, I am way overboard on Wisconsin time here, so I
appreciate that you would take the additional time here to be
as forthright as possible, and I appreciate you taking the time
this morning, Chief Moore, to set a little time aside to have a
real personal discussion in regards to this stuff.
We will be doing some follow-up. We appreciate you and your
staff engaging with us in regards to that, because we are
interested. It is clear that you are sincere about wanting to
have the best outcomes possible, and we want to work with you
to be able to do that.
Members of the Subcommittee may have some additional
questions for you, and we will ask that the witness respond to
these in writing. Under Committee Rule 3, members of the
Subcommittee must submit questions to the Subcommittee Clerk by
5 p.m. on Friday, June 7, 2024. The hearing record will be held
open for 10 business days for those responses.
And if there is no further business, it sure doesn't appear
so, we are pretty lonely here, Mr. Chief, without objection,
the Subcommittee on Federal Lands stands adjourned.

[Whereupon, at 12:18 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
