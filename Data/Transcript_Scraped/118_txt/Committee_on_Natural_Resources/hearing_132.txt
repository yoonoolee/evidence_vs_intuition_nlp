I. KEY MESSAGES

The Republican bills on today's hearing have broad support
in their local communities and represent locally-led
efforts to promote each area's unique natural and cultural
resources.

Legislation offered by Representatives Scalise and
Stefanik would expand existing heritage areas to bolster
local economies without allowing the federal government to
acquire land or impose new regulations.

Bills offered by Representatives Hill and Franklin
highlight the dichotomy between conservation designations
with and without local support. Representative Franklin's
legislation would prevent the potential designation of
hundreds of thousands of acres of wilderness in southern
Florida. This proposed wilderness designation is opposed by
a bipartisan coalition of Members of Congress, the local
community, and Tribal stakeholders. In contrast,
Representative Hill's legislation would add new lands to
the existing Flatside Wilderness and is supported by a
broad coalition of state and local stakeholders.

III. BACKGROUND
H.R. 390 (Rep. Stefanik), ``Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley
National Heritage Area Enhancement Act''

In 1984, President Reagan signed bipartisan legislation
establishing the country's first national heritage area (NHA), which
broadly ``recognize certain areas of the United States that tell
nationally significant stories [and] conserve, enhance, and interpret
those nationally significant stories and the natural, historic, scenic,
and cultural resources of areas.'' \1\ Today, there are 62 NHAs in 36
states that ``illustrate significant aspects of the heritage of the
United States.'' \2\ NHAs are unique public-private partnerships that
allow for the promotion of natural or cultural resources without
federal management or ownership.\3\ In the typical NHA, land is not
federally owned but is instead held by state or local governments,
private landowners, or some combination of those groups.\4\ As such,
NHAs are not units of the National Park System, although the National
Park Service (NPS) may provide NHAs with financial and technical
assistance. Because NHAs are ``lived-in landscapes,'' they are designed
to empower locally-led approaches to resource conservation and economic
development.\5\ To elevate grassroots-level decision-making, Congress
frequently assigns a local coordinating entity (LCE), such as a state
or local agency or non-profit organization, to be an NHA's lead
management organization.\6\

NHAs receive funding from varied sources, including private
charities and donors, state and local governments, and federal
appropriators.\7\ Federal funding is usually divided during the annual
appropriations process between direct grantmaking support for
individual NHAs and general administrative costs for the overall NHA
program.\8\ NPS then distributes authorized federal funds to NHA
entities, typically through the designated LCEs.\9\ In turn, the LCEs
are generally required to match all federal funding received one-to-
one.\10\ Once distributed, federal funds can be used for locally guided
projects, such as rehabilitating important sites, developing tours,
establishing exhibits and programs, and improving public awareness of
the NHA.\11\ Most NHAs are subject to an annual funding limit of $1
million, but actual expenditures have historically tended to be lower
than that amount.\12\

After NHAs exploded in popularity, Congress passed the ``National
Heritage Area Act'' (NHA Act) during the 117th Congress to formalize
the NHA System and protect private property rights.\13\ The NHA Act
established the National Heritage Area System, set formal criteria for
designating NHAs, and created uniform funding and management
standards.\14\ Through these changes, the NHA Act sought to minimize
the differences and administrative inefficiencies that had resulted
from creating NHAs under separate enabling acts.\15\ The NHA Act also
set forth stringent requirements protecting private property rights and
development activity in NHAs, ensuring that designations did not confer
any regulatory or land use authority to the local LCE.\16\ In addition
to NHA Act requirements, an individual NHA's enabling statute often
includes provisions that protect the rights of existing property owners
within the designated area and prevent any federal land
acquisitions.\17\

Established in 1996, the Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley
National Heritage Area (Hudson River Valley NHA) was among the earliest
NHAs to be designated by Congress.\18\ Following the Hudson River for
154 miles of its course through New York state, the Hudson River Valley
NHA encompasses 10 counties, 250 communities, and approximately 3
million acres of diverse geography, woods, and farmland.\19\ From north
to south, the Hudson River Valley NHA extends from the confluence of
the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers near Albany down to the northern suburbs
of New York City.\20\ This vast region contains 107 distinct heritage
sites, reflecting the Hudson River Valley's natural, historic, and
cultural contributions to the nation.\21\ This includes sites related
to the American Revolutionary War, Civil War, and Underground
Railroad.\22\

Recognizing the vital importance of this region to the national
story, H.R. 390, the ``Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley National
Heritage Area Enhancement Act,'' would expand the boundaries of the
Hudson River Valley NHA to include all of Saratoga and Washington
Counties. Large portions of these counties are already within the
Hudson NHA, and this legislation would bring the federal boundaries of
the NHA in line with the state's boundaries.\23\ H.R. 390 would help
enhance the interpretation of the Hudson River Valley NHA and expand
opportunities for Saratoga and Washington Counties to attract more
tourism and support local economic development.\24\ This bipartisan
bill is led by Representatives Elise Stefanik (R-NY) Paul Tonko (D-
NY).\25\

H.R. 3971 (Rep. Hill), ``Flatside Wilderness Additions Act''

The Ouachita National Forest (ONF) is the oldest and largest
national forest in the southern United States, spreading across nearly
1.8 million acres in Arkansas and Oklahoma.\26\ The U.S. Forest Service
(USFS) manages the ONF for a variety of uses, including timber
harvesting, wildlife habitat conservation, outdoor recreation, and
resource protection.\27\ The ONF's large expanses of hickory and pine
draw an estimated 670,000 visitors annually.\28\ Congress has
designated six wilderness areas within the ONF, which account for
little more than 65,000 acres, or a mere 3.6 percent of the ONF's total
area.\29\ This includes the 9,507-acre Flatside Wilderness area near
the ONF's eastern boundary.\30\ The Flatside Wilderness contains
portions of the 223-mile Ouachita National Recreation Trail and ``a
popular, 1,550-foot-high rock outcropping called Flatside Pinnacle that
overlooks the Ouachita Mountains.'' \31\

H.R. 3971 would add four parcels totaling roughly 2,215 acres of
ONF lands to the Flatside Wilderness. USFS recommended the inclusion of
these parcels in 2021 after completing a Congressionally directed
study.\32\ Congress previously expanded Flatside Wilderness in the
115th Congress by 640 acres.\33\ H.R. 3971's additions include Forked
Mountain, whose distinctive topography culminates in a 1,350-foot
summit that offers panoramas of nearby waterfalls and streams.\34\ The
bill is supported by Arkansas Governor Sarah Sanders, Arkansas Parks

H.R. 6826 (Rep. Mfume), To designate the visitor and education center
at Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine as the
Paul S. Sarbanes Visitor and Education Center.

H.R. 6826 would name the visitor and education center at Fort
McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine (Fort McHenry) in
Baltimore, Maryland, as the ``Paul S. Sarbanes Visitor and Education
Center.'' Fort McHenry is known as the site of the 1814 attack by
British troops against 1,000 American soldiers, a battle which inspired
Francis Scott Key to write the Star-Spangled Banner.\36\ The Honorable
Paul S. Sarbanes served the State of Maryland in the House of
Representatives for six years and in the U.S. Senate for three decades.
During his tenure, Senator Sarbanes helped secure funding for
constructing the new visitor center at Fort McHenry, increasing
capacity and visitor access.\37\ Naming the visitor and education
center at Fort McHenry would honor Senator Sarbanes's long history of
service to Maryland and his connection with the Fort McHenry site. This
bipartisan legislation is cosponsored by the entire Maryland
Congressional delegation.

H.R. 6843 (Rep. Scalise), To expand the boundaries of the Atchafalaya
National Heritage Area to include Lafourche Parish, Louisiana.

In 2006, Congress established the Atchafalaya National Heritage
Area (ANHA), encompassing 14 parishes in Louisiana to promote the
``local cuisine, music, traditions, language, and cultural landscapes
of the Atchafalaya Basin in south central Louisiana.'' \38\ The
Atchafalaya is the nation's largest river swamp, containing almost one
million acres of vibrant bottomland hardwoods, swamps, bayous, and
backwater lakes.\39\ The area features a diverse range of physical
resources, such as ancient live oaks, towering cypress, sugarcane, and
cotton.\40\ The region is also home to a diverse population of people
of European, African, Caribbean, and Native American descent that
collectively contribute to the area's widely recognized ``Cajun
Culture.'' \41\ By promoting heritage development and ecotourism, the
ANHA offers amenities for residents and visitors that highlight the
region's varied culture and physical resources while contributing to
the local economy.\42\ Through the ANHA, projects have been funded to
build kayak launches and install new signage along the Mississippi
River that promotes the area's heritage.\43\ H.R. 6843 would expand the
boundaries of the ANHA to include Lafourche Parish, Louisiana. By
expanding ANHA to include Lafourche Parish, H.R. 6843 aims to enhance
the interpretation of Louisiana's diverse heritage while creating jobs
and celebrating the region's rich natural and cultural resources.

H.R. 8206 (Franklin), To ensure that Big Cypress National Preserve may
not be designated as wilderness or as a component of the
National Wilderness Preservation System, and for other
purposes.

In 1974, Congress created the 729,000-acre Big Cypress National
Preserve (Big Cypress) in southern Florida as the nation's first
national preserve.\44\ At the time, Big Cypress was ``a new land
management concept'' designed to facilitate compromise in land uses
after significant controversy erupted over the proposed construction of
an airport.\45\ To avoid the stifling land-use restrictions and lack of
access characterized by other land designations, such as wilderness
areas, Congress created Big Cypress with explicit protections for
certain specified activities.\46\ Foremost among these are the
traditional and customary uses of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of
Florida and Seminole Tribe of Florida.\47\ Protected tribal activities
include using timber to build traditional shelters, called
``chickees,'' harvesting plants, and sustainably hunting wildlife.\48\
Other specified uses of Big Cypress include the exercise of existing
private property rights, operating off-road vehicles, conducting
limited oil and gas exploration, grazing cattle, and hunting.\49\

Despite these popular and enduring comprises, the unique nature of
Big Cypress is now under threat from the Biden administration. In
August 2022, NPS released a planning document entitled ``Big Cypress
National Preserve Supplemental Draft Backcountry Access Plan/
Wilderness Study/Environmental Impact Statement,'' which contemplates
creating a new wilderness designation within Big Cypress.\50\ While
NPS's ``preferred option'' for planning would designate about 25
percent of the preserve as wilderness, the 2022 document concludes that
roughly 43 percent of Big Cypress is eligible for a wilderness
designation.\51\ While the exact percentages vary, each of the NPS's
three plans for Big Cypress would create a new wilderness area within
the preserve.\52\

NPS's plans to designate portions of Big Cypress as wilderness have
drawn stiff opposition due to concerns the designation would limit
access for the public and outdoor recreationalists, disrupt invasive
species eradication work, and impinge upon traditional Tribal
practices.\53\ In particular, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of
Florida expressed significant concerns the wilderness designation would
limit the ability of Tribal members to access Big Cypress and visit 15
historic cultural sites and numerous active ceremonial grounds. In a
letter to NPS, Chairman Cypress wrote: ``Rather than imposing arbitrary
lines on a map to keep our people out, the [National Park Service]
would be well-served exporting to its other parks Big Cypress's
capacity for multiple uses, freedom of access, and respect for
Indigenous rights.'' \54\ Bipartisan Members of Florida's Congressional
delegation also wrote a letter to Secretary Haaland expressing concerns
on behalf of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and
Florida Department of Environmental Protection that a wilderness
designation would harm the ability to address more than 900 non-native
plant and animal species in the preserve, including pythons.\55\ In
response, Representative Scott Franklin (R-FL) introduced H.R. 8206,
bipartisan legislation that would prevent any part of Big Cypress from
being designated as a wilderness area.\56\ This legislation would
ensure Big Cypress continues to provide important benefits to outdoor
recreation communities, achieve diverse conservation goals, and remain
undisturbed as a sacred site to the Miccosukee and Seminole Tribes.

H.R. 8219 (Rep. Tokuda), ``Lahaina National Heritage Area Act''

The town of Lahaina, located in Maui County, Hawaii, has a rich and
storied history. The former capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom under King
Kamehameha I and his successors from 1820 to 1845, Lahaina was
historically an economic and tourism hub with incalculable cultural and
historic significance for the people of Hawaii.\57\ The downtown
Lahaina Historic District held numerous cultural sites, including the
Lahaina Jodo Mission (a Buddhist temple), Pioneer Inn (the oldest hotel
in Lahaina), Waiola Church, and Old Courthouse.\58\ Lahaina is also
famous for its 150-year-old Banyan Tree, considered the largest in the
country, which remains at the center of town.\59\ Unfortunately, on
August 8, 2023, a wildland fire catastrophically damaged Lahaina and
became the deadliest wildfire in over a century.\60\ The scenic
waterfront, including much of the city center that served as a symbol
of the town's illustrious history, was left unrecognizable. Ultimately,
the fire destroyed more than 2,200 structures and caused approximately
$5.5 billion in damages.\61\ Many of the damaged and destroyed
structures lost dated back centuries and held immeasurable value to
Lahaina's people and culture.

As the town continues to recover from the trauma of a devastating
natural disaster, local leaders have been exploring options that would
allow the community to honor its past while promoting its natural and
cultural resources post-fire. H.R. 8219 would require the Secretary of
the Interior, in consultation with state and local partners, to study
the suitability and feasibility of designating the town of Lahaina as
an NHA. A feasibility study is generally the first step of an NHA
designation and ensures that the designated area meets the appropriate
criteria. Under the NHA Act, studies must assess whether an area's
resources reflect aspects of American heritage, whether an area would
benefit from public-private management, and which entities would be
capable of working together to support the proposed heritage area.\62\

STATEMENT OF THE HON. TOM TIFFANY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN

Mr. Tiffany. Today's hearing includes several pieces of
legislation that recognize the importance of local communities
in Federal decision making. As Chairman of this Subcommittee, I
have worked tirelessly to ensure the perspectives of local
communities are included in both the decision-making process
and the subsequent management of our Federal lands. Our work
has shone a light on the need for Federal land management
agencies to meet their requirements to coordinate, not just
consult, with local partners.
Why is this so important? Because the rural communities
located closest to our Federal lands are typically their best
stewards. Their residents have an unrivaled interest in
ensuring that nearby public lands are properly managed for
generations to come.
One of the bills we will be considering today,
Representative Franklin's bipartisan H.R. 8206, embodies this
ethic by preventing an unpopular wilderness designation from
being established in Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida.
Fifty years ago, a group of local stakeholders, including
tribes, conservationists, and sportsmen and women, came
together to create the nation's first national preserve with
Big Cypress. This new model reflected the unique needs of the
community, and has proven to be a lasting compromise that
balances multiple uses of the land, including outdoor
recreation, tribal practices, and environmental protection.
That balance is now in jeopardy, due to the Biden
administration's efforts to designate one-quarter of the
preserve as a wilderness area.
In a letter to the National Park Service, one of our
witnesses here today, Chairman Cypress of the Miccosukee Tribe
of Indians of Florida, stated, ``Rather than imposing arbitrary
lines on a map to keep our people out, the National Park
Service would be well served exporting to its other parks Big
Cypress' capacity for multiple uses, freedom of access, and
respect for Indigenous rights.''
I could not agree more with this sentiment. We have heard
time and time again from this Administration that they value
tribal voices and consult with tribal communities. Yet, from
Alaska to Florida, coast to coast, it is clear that this
Administration is only interested in listening to tribes when
it is convenient for them. It is high time for Federal land
managers to respect multiple uses of our public lands, and
access for the American public to those lands. And Federal land
managers who continually fail to coordinate with local
officials and members of the community will face the
repercussions of those decisions in this Committee.
While I have legitimate concerns about certain components
of the legislation on today's agenda, I do want to thank all of
today's bill sponsors for working on their respective pieces of
legislation, and I look forward to hearing their perspective
throughout the hearing.
We will also hear about two bills being led by
Representatives Scalise and Stefanik that expand existing
National Heritage Areas.
Representative Scalise's bill adds the Lafourche Parish to
the National Heritage Area that was established in 2006 by
including the Lafourche Parish, which was omitted from the
original designation. The region will be able to offer
additional programs highlighting the unique Cajun culture and
history that have made southern Louisiana famous around the
world.
Representative Stefanik's bill expands the boundaries of
the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area to include all
of Saratoga and Washington Counties. This boundary will put the
National Heritage Area in line with state maps, and provide
more tools to promote the region to tourists who visit the
area.
Additionally, we are considering a bill sponsored by
Representative Tokuda. The Lahaina National Heritage Area Act
requires the Secretary of the Interior to study the suitability
and feasibility of designating the Town of Lahaina as a
National Heritage Area.
Last August, I visited Lahaina and witnessed the utter
devastation left by a wildfire that destroyed 2,200 structures
and caused approximately $5.5 billion in damages. As the
community rebuilds from this tragic event, I look forward to
hearing how the National Park Service plans to work with local
officials to honor and protect this town's rich and storied
history.
While National Heritage Areas are managed locally and not
federally owned, we must ensure that the planning process does
not impede private property rights or restrict responsible
development. Only then can these designations be supportable.
I want to thank Members on both sides of the dais for their
work on today's bills.
I also want to express my appreciation to the witnesses who
have traveled long distances to offer their expert testimony.
With that, I now recognize the Ranking Member, who is not
in attendance at this point. We will move on.
I will now recognize the gentleman from Arkansas, Mr. Hill,
to share with us information in regards to H.R. 3971.
You are recognized, sir.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. J. FRENCH HILL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS

Mr. Hill. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the time this
morning. I thank you and my good friend from Arkansas, the
Chairman of the Full Committee, Bruce Westerman, for working
with me and including the Flatside Wilderness Additions Act to
this hearing.
As a ninth-generation Arkansan and a lifelong outdoorsman,
I have enjoyed many extraordinary natural places across our
state throughout my life. From hiking, to hunting, to camping,
to canoeing as a boy, those were critical years, and ingrained
the ethos of a critical objective of conserving our resources
and preserving our natural habitat.
Throughout my nearly decade in Congress, I have worked
tirelessly to support our natural landscape, expand
recreational outdoor opportunities in the 2nd Congressional
District of Arkansas for both Arkansans and the many millions
of visitors to our state. This morning, I would like to share a
story with you, a story that goes back to the 98th Congress,
back in 1984.
On a cold, snowy day four decades ago, in the winter of
1983, I had the pleasure of visiting a remarkable corner of the
rugged Arkansas Ouachita National Forest. The Ouachita
stretched west from my district all the way to eastern
Oklahoma. That day, I climbed a very sharp sandstone top called
Flatside for the first time, that lends its name to this area.
Efforts to protect Flatside and expand the recreation in the
area began with my predecessor, Congressman Ed Bethune, who
worked to add Flatside to the proposed Arkansas Wilderness Act
that Congress.
At that time, I was a staffer on the Senate Banking
Committee, working for John Tower of Texas. Through my
connection to the outdoors in Arkansas, I persuaded Senator
Tower to co-sponsor the Senate version of Ed Bethune's bill,
Senator Dale Bumpers' bill, which was in fact signed into law
in October 1984 by President Reagan. That bill created Flatside
Wilderness, which is located in Perry and Saline Counties.
When I came to Congress in 2015, I started working on
strategies to enhance Flatside, and was successful in adding
640 acres to the western edge of the wilderness area when my
bill, the Flatside Wilderness Enhancement Act, was signed into
law by President Trump in 2019.
Following that success, John Boozman, our senior Senator,
and I worked on a study by the U.S. Forest Service to see if
additional lands adjacent to Flatside were eligible for
inclusion in the area. That study was completed in the summer
of 2021, and recommended the study areas contained in this bill
for wilderness designation. These proposed additions were among
those originally proposed back in 1984 that were not included
in the original Act, and are currently managed by the Forest
Service as potential wilderness in accordance with the Ouachita
National Forest Management Plan.
After working with Chairman Westerman, his team, and
Chairman Tiffany over the last 2 years, I introduced the
Flatside Wilderness Additions Act last June. This bill would
add approximately 2,200 U.S. National Forest acres to Flatside
Wilderness. The bill would be the second and final iteration to
expand the wilderness area at Flatside.
Flatside is a beautiful area of the natural state, noted
for its ridges and summits that are part of the Ouachita
Mountains and rise above the forest to provide visitors with
amazing views. The wilderness houses multiple creeks,
tributaries, and waterfalls that provide an important source of
life to the area, and includes, importantly and interestingly,
a 9-mile section of the 223-mile-long Ouachita National
Recreation Trail.
My work to expand Flatside has been complemented by the
efforts of the state to grow and expand our outdoor recreation
in many ways. Related work was in June 2021. Then-Governor Asa
Hutchinson and I reached an agreement with the Ouachita
National Forest to transfer operation of their Lake Sylvia
Recreation Area to the state of Arkansas. It is now part of the
Arkansas State Park system, opening up this beautiful area in
the Ouachita to campers and visitors on an all-year-long
operation.
My legislation, Mr. Chairman, is fully supported by our
state's conservation and outdoor recreation advocates.
Additionally, the leadership of our state supports it, with
formal letters of support from Governor Sarah Sanders; the
Arkansas Game and Fish Commission; the Arkansas Department of
Parks, Heritage, and Tourism; and our local Perry County judge.
There is something really special about hiking, camping,
and hunting deep in the back country of our state that feels
like it has gone untouched by human hands. Finishing the
expansion of the wilderness area at Flatside will bring more
opportunities for both Arkansans and the many visitors to our
state to explore more of our natural qualities.
I am grateful for Chairman Tiffany's work. I appreciate the
Committee's consideration of H.R. 3971, and I hope today's
testimony can help progress this bill along the way to
enactment.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Representative Hill. And now I
believe we are going to move on to our second panel.
Let me remind the witnesses that under Committee Rules, you
must limit your oral statement to 5 minutes, but your entire
statement will appear in the hearing record.
To begin your testimony, please press the ``on'' button on
the microphone.
We use timing lights. When you begin, the light will turn
green. At the end of 5 minutes, the light will turn red, and I
will ask you to please complete your statement.
First of all, thank you for your patience this morning, and
being here in a timely basis while I was not.
First, I would like to introduce Ms. Joy Beasley, Associate
Director for Cultural Resources, Partnerships and Science at
the National Park Service.
Associate Director Beasley, you are recognized for 5
minutes.

STATEMENT OF JOY BEASLEY, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, CULTURAL
RESOURCES, PARTNERSHIPS, AND SCIENCE, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE,
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, WASHINGTON, DC

Ms. Beasley. Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and
members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to
present the views of the Department of the Interior on five
bills on today's agenda. I would like to submit our full
statement for the record, and summarize the Department's views.
Two bills would expand the boundaries of National Heritage
Areas. H.R. 390 would expand Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River
Valley National Heritage Area to include Saratoga and
Washington Counties in New York. H.R. 6843 would expand
Atchafalaya National Heritage Area to include Lafourche Parish
in Louisiana.
The Department recognizes that there could be potential
benefits to expanding these National Heritage Areas, but
recommends that the Committee defer action on the bills until
such time as the National Park Service determines if each
proposed boundary addition is appropriate. The National Park
Service recommends that the local coordinating entity for each
National Heritage Area submit a justification for the
respective boundary additions, and to document that there is
local public support for the expansion.
H.R. 6826 would designate the visitor center at Fort
McHenry National Monument and National Shrine as the Paul S.
Sarbanes Visitor and Education Center. Senator Sarbanes was a
champion of Fort McHenry throughout his long career. He helped
to promote the fort's objectives of commemorating the Battle of
Baltimore, while facilitating public enjoyment and
understanding of the historic events and people connected to
the site.
The National Park Service generally discourages naming of
park features, except when there is a compelling justification
and when at least 5 years have elapsed since the death of the
person. However, we recognize that Congress may also
specifically authorize the placement of such recognition, and
in this instance the Department defers to Congress and does not
object to H.R. 6826.
H.R. 8206 would prohibit Big Cypress National Preserve from
being designated as wilderness, or as a component of the
National Wilderness Preservation System. The Department opposes
H.R. 8206.
This bill appears to be intended to pre-empt any proposal
from the Administration or any congressional decision to enact
a wilderness designation within the Preserve. If Congress does
not wish to designate wilderness in the Preserve, it can
achieve that goal by not acting on any legislation designating
wilderness within the Preserve, as only Congress can designate
wilderness.
Additionally, the National Park Service has not recommended
wilderness in this area, and therefore this legislation is
unnecessary.
The establishment of the Preserve remains a remarkable
example of unity and compromise among diverse stakeholders,
including local conservationists, government representatives,
outdoor recreationists, environmental advocates, and the
Miccosukee Tribe of Indians and the Seminole Tribe of Florida.
The law designated the Preserve as a unit of the National Park
System, ensured protection of resources, while simultaneously
providing for hunting, fishing, off-road vehicle use, private
camp ownership, and traditional use and occupancy rights for
Native American tribes.
The NPS remains committed to working with stakeholders,
local and state officials, and tribes on all issues of concern
within the Preserve.
H.R. 8219 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to
conduct a study to assess the suitability and feasibility of
designating a Lahaina National Heritage Area. The Department
supports H.R. 8219, with amendments.
Lahaina has a rich history, and was the capital of the
Kingdom of Hawaii from 1820 to 1845. Tragically, in August of
last year, the area was struck by one of the deadliest
wildfires in U.S. history. Several Department bureaus were part
of immediate response efforts, including staff from Haleakala
National Park. The Department, the National Park Service, and
Haleakala National Park will continue to support the long-term
recovery efforts of the Maui community.
We would like to work with the sponsor and the Committee on
an amendment that would identify a local organization to serve
as the NHA management entity. Identification of a local
management entity would indicate on-the-ground support and
capacity for engaging in the NHA feasibility study process.
We also recommend an amendment that would require
consultation with Native Hawaiian organizations and the Native
Hawaiian community, state and municipal government entities,
and the local community on the appropriate timing for
initiating the study so as not to interfere with ongoing
recovery efforts.
Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, this concludes my
statement. I would be happy to answer any questions you or
other members of the Subcommittee may have. Thank you.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Beasley follows:]
Prepared Statement of Joy Beasley, Associate Director, Cultural
Resources, Partnerships, and Science,
National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior
on H.R. 390, H.R. 6826, H.R. 6843, H.R. 8206, and H.R. 8219

H.R. 390

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the
Department of the Interior on H.R. 390, the Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson
River Valley National Heritage Area Enhancement Act.
The Department recognizes that there could be potential benefits in
expanding the Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley National Heritage
Area (NHA), but recommends that the committee defer action on H.R. 390
until such time as the National Park Service (NPS) determines if this
proposed expansion is appropriate.
H.R. 390 would expand the boundary of the Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson
River Valley NHA to include Saratoga and Washington Counties in the
State of New York. Both counties are located within the Champlain
Valley National Heritage Partnership, and portions of both counties are
within the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor.
The Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area
NHA was authorized in 1996, to help preserve, protect, and interpret
the history and resources of the Hudson River Valley. The region played
an important role in the American Revolution and gave birth to
significant developments in American art and architecture. It was
important in the iron and textile industries and housed the first
women's labor union and secondary school. The NHA includes National
Historic Sites, National Historic Landmarks, New York State Parks, and
over 1,000 sites listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
The Hudson River Valley Greenway (Greenway) is the management entity
for the NHA and is comprised of the Hudson River Valley Greenway
Communities Council and the Greenway Conservancy for the Hudson River
Valley.
Prior to beginning any effort to designate an area as a national
heritage area, the NPS recommends that a feasibility study be conducted
to assess several factors, including: whether the landscape has an
assemblage of natural, cultural, historic and scenic resources that,
when linked together, tell a nationally important story; whether an
organization exists with the financial and organizational capacity to
coordinate heritage area activities; and whether there is significant
support for designation within the region.
A 1996 special resource study was conducted of 10 counties along
the Hudson River. It found that the area's resources were nationally
significant and provided insight into the effect of natural landscapes
on settlement, commercial and industrial growth, and into the
development of our national political and cultural identity. The study
found that the area, which had demonstrated successful partnership
management, qualified as a national heritage area. The NPS recommends
that the Greenway submit an addendum to the study that includes a
boundary justification for the inclusion of Saratoga and Washington
Counties. The addendum would document that the Greenway has reached out
to the affected communities and that there is public support for the
inclusion of their counties in the boundary of the NHA. Additionally,
the addendum will demonstrate that the proposed inclusion of the
counties supports the original intent of the NHA.
Once the Greenway completes the study addendum, the NPS will
undertake its evaluation. The NPS recommends that the committee defer
action on H.R. 390 until the study addendum is completed and the NPS
can make a determination on the proposed expansion.

H.R. 6826

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the
Department of the Interior on H.R. 6826, which would designate the
visitor and education center at Fort McHenry National Monument and
National Shrine the ``Paul S. Sarbanes Visitor and Education Center''.
The visitor and education center is located at Fort McHenry
National Monument and Historic Shrine in Baltimore, Maryland, just
outside the fort's primary historic area, and is accessed from its main
entrance on East Fort Avenue. The visitor and education center serves
as the first contact station for visitors entering the park and offers
an orientation film and exhibits regarding the Battle of Baltimore and
the history of the ``Star-Spangled Banner.'' Fort McHenry National
Monument and Historic Shrine is also one of the key sites on the Star
Spangled Banner National Historic Trail.
Senator Sarbanes was a tireless champion of preserving Fort Mc
Henry throughout his long career. In so many different ways, he helped
to promote the fort's chief objectives of commemorating the events of
the Battle of Baltimore while facilitating public enjoyment and
understanding of the historic events and people connected with the
site. Over decades, the Senator secured millions of dollars in federal
funds to enable critical repairs to the fort's deteriorating seawall,
masonry, and foundations, ensuring the site would be safe to visit for
generations to come. He also envisioned Fort McHenry's inclusion in the
Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail, championing legislation
to study and eventually create a National Trail to highlight the
British burning of the White House and Capitol in Washington, DC, the
Battle of Baltimore, and the bombing of Fort McHenry, which inspired
Francis Scott Key's composition of ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
Senator Sarbanes also worked to elevate the history of the War of
1812 in the national consciousness by introducing federal legislation
to commemorate the war's bicentennial. Through his service as Vice-
Chair of the Maryland War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission from 2007 to
2015, the Senator helped improve and protect relevant historic sites
like Fort McHenry and coordinated public and private events to
celebrate the anniversary. Finally, in the 2000s, the Senator was
integral in securing the funds that enabled the construction of a new
visitor and education center at the fort, replacing the old visitor
center from the 1960s with an ADA- compliant building that today
welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors a year as they learn about
one of the defining moments in our nation's history.
H.R. 6826 would designate the visitor and education center at Fort
McHenry National Monument and National Shrine as the ``Paul S. Sarbanes
Visitor and Education Center.'' The NPS generally discourages the
naming of park features except when there is a compelling justification
and at least five years have elapsed since the death of the person.
However, we recognize that Congress may also specifically authorize the
placement of such recognition. In this instance, the Department defers
to Congress and does not object to H.R. 6826.

H.R. 6843

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the
Department of the Interior on H.R. 6843, a bill to expand the
boundaries of the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area to include
Lafourche Parish, Louisiana.
The Department recognizes that there could be potential benefits in
expanding the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area (NHA), but recommends
that the committee defer action on H.R. 6843 until such time as the
National Park Service (NPS) determines if this proposed expansion is
appropriate.
H.R. 6843 would expand the boundary of the Atchafalaya NHA to
include Lafourche Parish and would add one member to the Atchafalaya
Trace Commission. The NHA was authorized in 2006, to help preserve the
local cuisine, music, traditions, language, and cultural landscapes of
the Atchafalaya Basin in south central Louisiana. The area is among the
most culturally rich and ecologically varied regions in the United
States, home to the widely recognized Cajun culture as well as a
diverse population of European, African, Caribbean and Native-American
descent. The NHA includes a part of Jean Lafitte National Historical
Park, Lake Fausse Pointe State Park, Cypremort Point State Park, a part
of Natchez Trace Parkway and National Scenic Trail, and the Atchafalaya
Water Heritage Trail. The Atchafalaya Trace Commission was authorized
as the management entity of the NHA and is composed of 14 members
appointed by the governing authority of each parish within the heritage
area.
Prior to beginning any effort to designate an area as a national
heritage area, the NPS recommends that a feasibility study be conducted
to assess several factors, including: whether the landscape has an
assemblage of natural, cultural, historic and scenic resources that,
when linked together, tell a nationally important story; whether an
organization exists with the financial and organizational capacity to
coordinate heritage area activities; and whether there is significant
support for designation within the region.
A 1998 special resource study found the Atchafalaya Basin to be an
outstanding example of a natural resource, possessed exceptional value
in illustrating and interpreting many key natural and cultural themes
of our nation's heritage, and offered exceptional opportunities for
recreation, public use and enjoyment, and scientific study. The NPS
recommends that the Commission submit an addendum to the study that
includes a boundary justification for the inclusion of Lafourche
Parish. The addendum would document that the Commission has reached out
to the affected communities and that there is public support for the
inclusion of their parish in the boundary of the NHA. Additionally, the
addendum will demonstrate that the proposed inclusion of the parish
supports the original intent of the NHA.
Once the Commission completes the study addendum, the NPS will
undertake its evaluation. The NPS recommends that the committee defer
action on H.R. 6843 until the study addendum is completed and the NPS
can make a determination on the proposed expansion.

H.R. 8206

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the Department
of the Interior's views on H.R. 8206, a bill to ensure that Big Cypress
National Preserve may not be designated as wilderness or a component of
the National Wilderness Preservation System, and for other purposes.
The Department opposes H.R. 8206.
H.R. 8206 would prohibit Big Cypress National Preserve (Preserve)
from being designated as wilderness or a component of the National
Wilderness Preservation System. The bill appears to be intended to
preempt any proposal from the Administration, or any Congressional
decision, to enact a wilderness designation within the Preserve. If
Congress does not want to designate wilderness in the Preserve, it can
achieve that goal by not acting on any legislation designating
wilderness within the Preserve, as only Congress can designate
wilderness. Additionally, the National Park Service has not recommended
wilderness in this area. Therefore, this legislation is unnecessary.
The historical establishment of the Preserve remains a remarkable
example of unity and compromise among diverse stakeholders, including
local conservationists, government representatives, outdoor
recreationists, environmental advocates, and the Miccosukee Tribe of
Indians and Seminole Tribe of Florida. In the 1960s, these groups
united to protect the Big Cypress Swamp from a major jetport
development that posed a threat to the area's invaluable natural and
cultural assets. Their collective efforts led to the establishment of
the Preserve, our nation's first national preserve, in 1974. The law
designating the Preserve as a unit of the National Park System ensured
protection of these resources while simultaneously providing diverse
public land uses, including hunting, fishing, off road vehicle use,
private camp ownership, and traditional use and occupancy rights for
Native American Tribes. The NPS remains committed to working with
stakeholders, local and state officials, and Tribes--the Miccosukee
Tribe of Indians and the Seminole Tribe of Florida--on all issues of
concern within the Preserve.

H.R. 8219

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the
Department of the Interior on H.R. 8219, a bill to require the
Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to assess the suitability
and feasibility of designating certain land as the Lahaina National
Heritage Area, and for other purposes.
The Department supports H.R. 8219 with amendments.
H.R. 8219 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct
a study, in consultation with appropriate State and local entities, to
assess the suitability and feasibility of designating an area in Maui
County, Hawai'i as the Lahaina National Heritage Area. The study area
would encompass the boundaries of the census-designated place of
Lahaina. The study would gather information to help determine whether
the area contains an assemblage of natural, historic, and cultural
resources that represent distinctive aspects of the heritage of the
United States; is worthy of recognition, conservation, interpretation,
and continuing use; and would be best managed through partnerships
among public and private entities. The study would include public
engagement and be conducted in consultation with the various
stakeholders in the area.
The Lahaina census-designated place, located on the northwest coast
of Maui, encompasses Lahaina town, Ka'anapali and Kapalua beaches, and
the lower slopes of the West Maui mountains. Lahaina has a rich history
and was the capital of the Kingdom of Hawai'i from 1820 to 1845. The
Lahaina Historic District, which encompasses downtown Lahaina, Front
Street, and its vicinity, was designated a National Historic Landmark
in 1962. Tragically, in August 2023, the area was struck by one of the
deadliest wildfires in U.S. history. The fire destroyed approximately
80% of Lahaina, and over 100 people lost their lives. Several
Department bureaus were part of immediate response efforts, including
staff from Haleakala National Park. The fires directly impacted
National Park Service employees, and several have familial and
community ties to the Lahaina area. The Department, the National Park
Service, and Haleakala National Park will continue to support the long-
term recovery efforts of the Maui community.
We would like to work with the sponsor and the Committee on an
amendment that would identify a local organization in the legislation
that would serve as a national heritage area management entity.
Identification of a potential local management entity would indicate
on-the-ground support and capacity for engaging in the national
heritage area feasibility study process. We also recommend an amendment
that would explicitly require consultation with State and local
historic preservation officers, State and local historical societies,
State and local tourism offices, and other appropriate organizations
and governmental entities, on the appropriate timing for initiating the
study so as not to interfere with ongoing recovery efforts.

Chairman Tiffany, this concludes my testimony. I would be happy to
answer any questions you or other members of the subcommittee may have.

an hour, because we do have quite a few amendment votes that
are going to be done in this series. So, there will be a
significant break here.
And once again, we really appreciate your patience in
helping us with this, because we really do look forward to your
testimony on these bills.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. KWEISI MFUME, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MARYLAND

Mr. Mfume. Thank you, Chairman Gosar, and to Ranking Member
Neguse in his absence for hosting this legislative hearing, and
including my bipartisan bill, H.R. 6826, which honors the
former long-standing U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland by
designating the Visitor and Education Center at Fort McHenry
National Monument and Historic Shrine as the Paul S. Sarbanes
Visitor and Education Center.
Fort McHenry, the National Monument and Historic Shrine, is
a unit of the National Park Service, and it resides in the
heart of my congressional district in Baltimore. As most of us
know, the fort was the site of the Battle of Baltimore in 1814,
which inspired Francis Scott Key to write the words to the
Star-Spangled Banner. Each year, hundreds of thousands of
people visit the fort to engage in outdoor recreation and to
learn more about one of the most defining moments of our
nation's history.
The late Senator Sarbanes was a champion of Fort McHenry,
and he firmly believed that the site is critical to
understanding and appreciating our national heritage and our
national identity. Throughout his career, the Senator worked
tirelessly to facilitate public enjoyment and real
understanding of the historic events and the people who are
still connected with that site.
Senator Sarbanes, as many of us will note, was a true
American patriot. He secured millions of dollars in Federal
funds to enable critical repairs to the fort's deteriorating
seawall, its masonry, and its foundations, and he worked for
the construction of a new visitor center. He also introduced
numerous bipartisan bills that eventually established the Star-
Spangled Banner National Historic Trail as the 26th such trail
in our nation.
As we know, Congress may at any time authorize placement of
a commemorative work, such as naming the Center in cases where
there is a compelling justification for the recognition that
would permanently express the noteworthy and nationally
relevant association between both the person and the site. I
believe, Mr. Chair, such is the case in this instance, and
passing H.R. 6826 would be both a fitting tribute to the
Senator's memory, and an appropriate acknowledgment of his
connection to and advocacy for this site, the state, and the
nation.
And I would ask and seek, Mr. Chair, our unanimous consent
that the Friends of Fort McHenry, which is the organization
that has been there forever supporting it, sent a letter in to
this Committee and to our delegation in enthusiastic support
for this bill, and with unanimous consent I would offer it for
the record.
Dr. Gosar. Without objection, so ordered.

Friends of Fort McHenry

Baltimore, MD

November 16, 2023

Re: Friends of Fort McHenry--Support for the ``Paul S. Sarbanes Visitor
and Education Center''

Dear Members of the Maryland Congressional Delegation:

We write today to express our enthusiastic support for a proposed
effort to name the visitor and education center at Fort McHenry in
memory of the late Senator Paul S. Sarbanes. With our stewardship role
at Fort McHenry, we were honored to have Senator Sarbanes as a tireless
champion of the fort throughout his long career. In so many different
ways, he helped to promote the fort's chief objectives of commemorating
the events of the Battle of Baltimore while facilitating public
enjoyment and understanding of the historic events and people connected
with the site. For all these reasons, we urge you to advance
legislation to designate the ``Paul S. Sarbanes Visitor and Education
Center'' at Fort McHenry.
Senator Sarbanes' legacy of public service can be felt across the
country, but nowhere is it stronger than at Fort McHenry, which he
often described as his favorite national park. The Senator considered
the site to be one of the great public gathering places in our state--a
guardian of our national heritage and a key recreational and
environmental resource for the residents of Baltimore.
Over decades, the Senator secured millions of dollars in federal
funds to enable critical repairs to the fort's deteriorating seawall,
masonry, and foundations, ensuring the site will be safe to visit for
generations to come. He also envisioned Fort McHenry's inclusion in the
Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail, championing legislation
to study and eventually create a National Trail to highlight the
British burning of the White House and Capitol in Washington, DC, the
Battle of Baltimore, and the bombing of Fort McHenry, which inspired
Francis Scott Key's composition of ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
Senator Sarbanes also worked to elevate the history of the War of
1812 in the national consciousness by introducing federal legislation
to commemorate the war's bicentennial. Through his service as Vice-
Chair of the Maryland War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission from 2007 to
2015, the Senator helped improve and protect relevant historic sites
like Fort McHenry and coordinate public and private events to celebrate
the anniversary. Finally, in the 2000's, the Senator was integral in
securing the funds that enabled construction of a new visitor and
education center at the fort, replacing the old visitor center from the
1960's with an ADA-compliant building that today welcomes hundreds of
thousands of visitors a year as they learn about one of the defining
moments in our nation's history.
The Board of the Friends of Fort McHenry, a non-profit organization
dedicated to ensuring the widest possible appreciation of Fort
McHenry's enduring legacy and the fort's survival as an ``historic
shrine'' for future generations of Americans, is very grateful that
Senator Sarbanes so steadfastly shared our passion and goals for the
fort. We wholeheartedly believe that designating the fort's welcome
center as the ``Paul S. Sarbanes Visitor and Education Center'' would
be a fitting tribute to the Senator's life and career and serve as a
permanent expression of his close association with the fort.

Best,

Patty Dowd,
Director

Dr. Gosar. Does the gentleman yield back?
Mr. Mfume. I do, Mr. Chair, I am sorry. Thank you for being
so gracious, and allowing me to waive on to this Committee. I
appreciate it.
Dr. Gosar. We are happy to have you.
Mr. Mfume. Thank you.
Dr. Gosar. Always a smiling face. I now recognize
Representative Franklin for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. SCOTT FRANKLIN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

Mr. Franklin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate
your attention to this important matter that affects the Big
Cypress National Preserve and many constituents in my district.
I also thank you for your Committee's willingness to consider
my bipartisan bill, H.R. 8206, which would protect this
preserve from Federal Government overreach in the Miccosukee
Tribe's access to their sacred lands.
Before I go any further, I would like to take a brief
moment to welcome Talbert Cypress, Chief of the Miccosukee
Tribe, serving as our witness today. Chairman Cypress grew up
on the reservation, and understands better than anyone the
adverse effect a wilderness designation would have on the
preserve and the Miccosukees' way of life. He has also been a
great partner, and I am pleased others will have the pleasure
of hearing from him today.
In the 1960s, plans emerged for the construction of an
airport in the heart of the Everglades. This project promised
to spur further commercial development that threatened Big
Cypress. In a compromise effort to protect their region,
conservationists, environmentalists, tribes, and gladesmen
teamed up to lobby Congress, and the result was our nation's
first national preserve, the Big Cypress National Preserve,
authorized by Congress in 1974. Representative James Haley from
my state was integral in that process.
Upon designation of the Big Cypress, Congress provided the
National Park Service with the authority to study the
wilderness suitability of the lands. This study was completed
in 1979, and concluded that there was no wilderness-suitable
acreage in the Big Cypress National Preserve, but NPS vowed to
restudy the preserve in the future, and in 2006 they began that
process. They released the findings publicly in the Big Cypress
National Preserve supplemental draft in August 2022, which
proposed that Congress could designate as much as 32 percent of
the Preserve as wilderness, the operative word being ``could
designate.''
The ambiguity in the statute, though, that the land could
be eligible for wilderness designation has led the Park Service
to begin managing these areas in what they like to refer to as
the ``little W wilderness'' in the interim, as though Congress
had authorized that, which is not the case. Currently, they are
managing approximately 148,000 acres of land, which is 25
percent of the Preserve, as wilderness.
And a wilderness designation sounds like a beneficial thing
until you really start to look into the details. This
qualification creates burdensome restrictions on Federal land,
including no inhabitants, no permanent structures, and no
motorized vehicles whatsoever. And due to the size and
geography of Big Cypress, which is essentially the size of the
state of Rhode Island, limiting traffic there means the
Miccosukee Tribe won't have access to their sacred burial
sites, hunters won't be able to help manage Florida's ongoing
invasive python invasion, and gladesmen who have used the land
for generations will have their access to the land severely
restricted.
And my bill, H.R. 8206, would release lands in the Big
Cypress National Preserve from further wilderness
consideration. If the Department of the Interior decides to
move forward with proposing wilderness at Big Cypress, it will
be against the will of not only the Miccosukee Tribe, but also
the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the Florida
Fish and Wildlife Commission, and Hendry and Collier Counties,
in which the Preserve is within their boundaries.
Executive overreach like this is why many Americans are
frustrated with the Federal Government. The Supreme Court seems
poised to scale back, or even return some of that authority to
Congress as it is looking at the Chevron deference case, and I
hope they do. Congress will be required to reclaim its Title I
authority and do the job it was always intended to do under the
Constitution. It will require all of us to be clearer and more
precise in the laws we write, and it will also expose the
absurd ways the Federal Government has exploited ambiguity or
wiggle room in statute to satisfy their own agendas, and much
of that has come at the expense of Americans. More legislation
like this will be necessary to clarify congressional intent and
agency authority, and I am fairly certain Congress never
intended the Park Service to have that level of authority to
manage Big Cypress as a wilderness without express approval of
Congress.
As an avid outdoorsman, I appreciate the need to strike a
balance between conservation and public access. And in Florida,
we know that often the best way to protect our state's natural
beauty is to leave it in the care of those who have been
charged with preserving it for generations. Agency decisions
should respect the will of Congress while benefiting our
cherished lands and the public's trust.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

Dr. Gosar. I thank you, Representative Franklin. I now
recognize Representative Tokuda for her 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. JILL N. TOKUDA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF HAWAII

Ms. Tokuda. Thank you. Chair, members of the Federal Lands
Subcommittee, thank you for including H.R. 8219, my Lahaina
National Heritage Area Act, in today's hearing, and mahalo for
the opportunity to speak in support of this important bill.
To Subcommittee Chair Tiffany, I want to thank him
personally for joining Chairman Westerman and other members of
this Committee in coming out to Lahaina in the immediate
aftermath of the fires to see the destruction firsthand and
offer words of support and comfort to our grieving community.
On August 8, 2023, Lahaina experienced a devastating
wildfire that destroyed the entire town and claimed the lives
of 102 members of our community. In just a single day,
centuries of history and culture were reduced to ashes, causing
significant physical damage and emotional trauma that will be
felt in Lahaina, on Maui, and throughout our entire state of
Hawaii for generations to come.
As we approach the 1-year anniversary of the fire, debris
cleanup continues and thousands of survivors remain in short-
term housing, many scattered across our islands and even the
continent, focused on rebuilding their lives. It is at this
moment in time that we reflect on how to honor the people and
places lost, and support our community in its recovery.
While this tragedy will be felt by our Hawaii ohana for
generations, it compels us to reflect on Lahaina's rich
cultural history and environmental beauty, elements that the
wildfire could never destroy. While Lahaina has been known
worldwide as a premier tourist destination, it holds a deeper
historical, cultural, and ecological significance that predates
its modern reputation. Lele, or Lahaina, as it has become
known, has always been a place of immense historical and
cultural importance, serving as the capital of the Kingdom of
Hawaii and the birthplace and home to many ali'i. As we look to
rebuild, it is about grounding this place in the history and
heritage from which it came.
Of the 62 National Heritage Areas in the United States,
none are in Hawaii. I can think of no better place to designate
as Hawaii's first National Heritage Area than Lahaina. This is
why I am proud to introduce the Lahaina National Heritage Area
Act, which would direct the National Park Service, in
consultation with state and local partners, to study the
suitability and feasibility of this designation for Lahaina.
Designating Lahaina as a National Heritage Area would
complement and sustain community-driven efforts being led by
lineal descendants and local leaders to preserve Lele's rich
history, tradition, and culture for future generations.
While I am humbled to introduce this bill, the idea and
effort to recognize and protect this special place comes from
those who have called Lahaina home for generations. During my
visits to Lahaina following the fires, it has become customary
to end my visits at Malauulu, once the home of King Kamehameha
the Third, and then walk over to the birthing stones in Lahaina
Harbor. Conversations held here with lineal descendants like
Archie Kalepa and Keeaumoku Kapu allowed us to imagine a future
where Moku'ula and Mokuhinia are restored, and Kihawahine is
finally returned to her home in Lahaina.
In recognizing the significance of this bill and its
sensitivity to survivors, I have personally spoken with
Governor Josh Green, Mayor Richard Bissen, and local cultural
practitioners. All support this bill and would be key to its
execution when passed. And I would like to ask unanimous
consent to enter their written testimonies into the record.
Dr. Gosar. Without objection, so ordered.

Statement for the Record
Honorable Josh Green, M.D.
Governor of the State of Hawai'i
Statement on H.R. 8219--Lahaina National Heritage Area Act

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, Members of the
Subcommittee:

Mahalo for the opportunity to submit testimony on H.R. 8219, the
Lahaina National Heritage Area Act. I write to you in my capacity as
the Governor of the State of Hawai'i.
On August 8, 2023, strong easterly winds caused by Hurricane Dora
to the south of the State of Hawai'i strengthened various wildfires
across the Counties of Maui and Hawai'i. The wildfire that began in the
western part of Maui Island decimated the town of Lahaina and is the
deadliest wildfire in U.S. history in the last 100 years. As of today,
the incident has resulted in 101 fatalities; billions of dollars are
estimated to have been lost to properties, facilities, and
infrastructure. Hundreds of businesses were destroyed, and hazardous
environmental conditions were created as a result of the fires.
This act would help to provide cultural significance and ensure the
preservation of important sites as we continue to work to rebuild
Lahaina and restore its heritage.
We greatly appreciate the subcommittee's time and attention to this
matter. Beginning the process of a heritage designation through a
feasibility study by the Department of the Interior would provide an
important step in recognition for the people and history of our state.
I would like to commend Congresswoman Tokuda for her time and
dedication for Lahaina's recovery. I am grateful that this legislation
was introduced by her.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide support for this
meaningful piece of legislation. My administration stands ready to
support the Department of the Interior with the feasibility study and
will continue to work with the County of Maui, Mayor Bissen, and
Congresswoman Tokuda for the people of the State of Hawai'i and

Statement for the Record
Richard T. Bissen, Jr.
Mayor, County of Maui
Statement on H.R. 8219--Lahaina National Heritage Area Act

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking MemberNeguse, members of the
subcommittee:

Thank you for allowing me to submit a statement on behalf of H.R.
8219, the Lahaina National Heritage Area Act. My name is Richard T.
Bissen, Jr. and I have been Mayor of Maui County since January 2023.
Prior to becoming mayor, I grew up, went to school, worked as a
prosecutor and judge on Maui and have called it home for many years.
Eight months after taking office, the town of Lahaina on the island
of Maui endured unspeakable tragedy. On August 8, 2023, wildfires
spread so quickly across Lahaina that some people were unable to
evacuate. Many others barely made it out or managed to survive, homes
and businesses were destroyed.
In total, 101 people died from the fires. Our beloved Front Street,
home to local businesses and a centerpiece of the memories of many who
have visited our island, is no longer recognizable. So much of what we
had is now gone, but we have started to recover and figure out what it
will take to rebuild and restore Lahaina for its new future.
One thing the fires could not take away is the historic and
cultural importance of Lahaina. Lahaina was once the capital city of
the Kingdom of Hawaii and served as the center of government for 50
years. Lahaina served as the residence of King Kamehameha I for decades
and was where kings and queens were buried. Its harbor was the
cornerstone of whaling and fishing for the Hawaiian Islands. Lahaina
also served as the location for so many firsts, such as the first high
school west of the Rocky Mountains and the first lit navigation tower.
I can think of no better place to be the first National Heritage
Area in the State of Hawaii.
This designation would provide critical assistance to bring back
important sites and help highlight the cultural significance of so many
locations throughout Lahaina. This will not only help us in our efforts
to rebuild and bring back Lahaina, but it is also a clear testament to
Lahaina's rich heritage and a recognition of its importance to our
people, our history, and to Hawaii.
H.R. 8219, the Lahaina National Heritage Area Act would begin the
process of this designation by initiating a feasibility study to be
conducted by the Department of Interior. If this designation is
approved in the future, the County of Maui stands ready to administer
and support accordingly. I wholeheartedly support its passage and thank
Congresswoman Tokuda for her all her time and attention toward
Lahaina's recovery and for introducing this legislation.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of H.R. 8219. I
look forward to the advancement of this bill and I am happy to answer
any questions the subcommittee may have.

Statement for the Record
Mr. Ke`eaumoku Kapu
Cultural Program Coordinator, Na`Aikane o Maui Community Foundation
Statement on H.R. 8219--Lahaina National Heritage Area Act

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, members of the
subcommittee:

My name is Ke'eaumoku Kapu, a lifelong Native Hawaiian cultural
practitioner and the cultural program coordinator at the Na`Aikane o
Maui Community Foundation. Since 2011, our organization has been
dedicated to helping guide Lahaina's future generations with our
traditional knowledge and practices.
I also serve as chair of the Native Hawaiian Historic Preservation
Council of the State of Hawai'i's Office of Hawaiian Affairs. Our role
is to perpetuate the cultural identity of Native Hawaiian people
through responsible stewardship of our traditions, practices, values,
and cultural and historic resources.
West Maui has been the ancestral home of my family for generations.
To the hills east of Lahaina lies the Kaua'ula Valley in which you can
find the plot of land that my ancestors were awarded in the Great
Mahele, which introduced private property ownership to Hawai'i for the
first time in our history. Doing so separated many Native Hawaiians
from the ancestral lands they lived on, including my own family.
Reclaiming this land where my family and I now live has been a decades-
long journey, but it shows how deeply we are tied as a people to the
`aina.
That is why I am proud to testify in support of Representative Jill
Tokuda's bill, H.R. 8219, the Lahaina National Heritage Area Act. For
kanaka maoli like me whose ties to West Maui span generations, Lahaina
has long been a spiritual and cultural capital for our people, even as
it was transformed from wetlands into sugar plantations and then into
the famous tourist hub it was for most of my life.
The fires last August changed everything. Our Na`Aikane o Maui
Cultural Center on Front Street was among the thousands of buildings we
lost. With it, hundreds of artifacts documenting the history of our
people were lost, including traditional feathered capes, historical
maps, and old land deeds that could have helped other Native Hawaiian
families reclaim their ancestral lands.
Despite all this loss, the work of Na`Aikane o Maui in protecting
our culture and traditions will not cease. We will rebuild and continue
our work. In the meantime, I have been focused on supporting our local
people and serving as a cultural advisor to our federal and state
relief and recovery efforts.
The fires have given us a new opportunity to rebuild and restore
Lahaina in a way that reflects its rich history and cultural heritage.
The community has rallied around the restoration of Moku`ula, a sacred
island once surrounded by the freshwater pond Loko o Mokuhinia and
formerly the site of King Kamehameha Ill's royal palace, that has long
been buried.
Establishing a National Heritage Area for Lahaina would go a long
way in supporting the community's efforts to preserve and protect this
place that is central to our history and culture, especially after the
fires last August. There is already a community-driven effort to
accomplish this, and the National Heritage Area designation would help
tell the important stories that Lahaina has to share with the rest of
Hawai'i, the United States, and the world.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide written testimony in
support of H.R. 8219. I would be pleased to answer any additional
questions the subcommittee may have on this bill.

______

Ms. Tokuda. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I want to also thank them for their testimony and support
of this designation.
I also would like to thank my colleagues who co-sponsored
this bill, especially members of this Natural Resources
Committee, including Ranking Member Neguse and Congressmen
LaMalfa, Huffman, Sablan, and Case. Your support is deeply
appreciated. Mahalo.
Lastly, I want to thank the National Park Service, which
has truly created a first-of-its-kind national model for
cultural consultation throughout the cleanup and recovery
process in Lahaina. The steps they have taken to meaningfully
engage with the local Native Hawaiian community and incorporate
the community's traditional practices in their plans has given
me confidence in their ability to effectively implement this
study with the kind of respect and honor that Native Hawaiians
and other Indigenous people deserve.
I hope this bill is the very first step in ensuring that
Lahaina finally gets the recognition that she has long
deserved. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I yield back.

Dr. Gosar. I thank the gentlelady. I will now recognize the
Chairman of Miccosukee Tribe of the Indians of Florida.
Chairman Cypress, you have 5 minutes. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. TALBERT CYPRESS, CHAIRMAN, MICCOSUKEE
TRIBE OF INDIANS OF FLORIDA, MIAMI, FLORIDA

Mr. Cypress. Good morning, Chair, Ranking Member, and
members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to
appear before you today. I am Talbert Cypress, Chairman of the
Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the federally
recognized tribe in the heart of the Everglades and Big Cypress
National Preserve. I appreciate the opportunity today to
discuss the importance of the Big Cypress National Preserve to
the Miccosukee people, and how wilderness designations in the
Preserve threaten our way of life.
The Miccosukee Tribe supports H.R. 8206, which would
prevent the Big Cypress National Preserve from being designated
as wilderness. The impact of wilderness designations too often
is to dispossess Native people of their lands in the name of
conservation. That is because the Wilderness Act is designed to
prevent occupancy, permanent improvements, or mechanized
vehicle usage on designated lands. As a result, Natives still
living on traditional lands have been removed, harassed, and
convicted of crimes related to their traditional practices
under the Wilderness Act.
The Wilderness Act must not be applied to the Big Cypress
National Preserve, ever. By preventing a wilderness designation
we can ensure that Big Cypress will continue to serve the
purposes for which it was created, with Indigenous inhabitants
to steward its lands, access for the public to experience its
abundance and beauty, and effective management of invasive and
exotic species.
Big Cypress is home to the Miccosukee and Seminole people.
There are 15 remaining traditional Miccosukee and Seminole
villages in Big Cypress National Preserve, as well as several
ceremonial grounds, burial grounds, and gathering sites in
every park unit within the Preserve. We live in Big Cypress,
and our ancestors fought and died there. They are buried there.
The Big Cypress is a part of us, and we are a part of it.
Our ancestors taught us and we teach our children that it
is the duty of every Miccosukee to preserve and protect our
lands. To that end, we are involved in multiple projects to
protect, preserve, and restore our ancestral lands. We are
finally in the driver's seat, and our voice is at the center of
Everglades restoration. By placing a legal obstacle between
tribes and their rights to use and occupy ancestral lands, the
government will pose an impossible choice: complying with
restrictions that impede our ability to use and manage our
ancestral lands, or risk prosecution and incarceration.
Application of the Wilderness Act to the Big Cypress can
prevent motorized access by Miccosukee tribal members to their
ancestral lands, large gatherings at our sacred ceremonial
grounds in the Big Cypress, and can prevent adequate management
of the invasive pythons and tree species that threaten the
ecosystems within the Big Cypress.
More fundamentally, a wilderness designation hinders our
ability to influence the management of these lands and
threatens to obstruct our traditional religious observance and
way of life. Our children will not be able to enjoy the fruits
of their ancestral lands, they will not see her beauty up
close, we will not be able to harvest our medicine, we will not
be able to bury our dead traditionally. Our annual religious
ceremonies will only continue on Federal lands if we violate
Federal law. That is injustice, and does not reflect the
highest ideals of the United States in the 21st century of
fulfilling promises made to sovereign tribes.
The Big Cypress is the sacred land of the Miccosukee. This
is our home and our responsibility. Don't just force regulation
and designations on my people. Follow our lead, permit us to
guide you to the right path forward in the Big Cypress, our
home. Through all of this, I am still optimistic that the
Tribe, Congress, and the Park Service can do what is right for
the Everglades and our sacred land. But designating or
proposing to designate any part of the Big Cypress as
wilderness is not the answer.
I truly appreciate the opportunity to address this
Subcommittee and thank you for your support that you have shown
to tribes and their sovereignty. I look forward to any
questions you may have.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Cypress follows:]
Prepared Statement of Talbert H. Cypress, Chairman, Miccosukee Tribe of
Indians of Florida
on H.R. 8206

Good morning, Chair Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of
the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you
today. I am Talbert H. Cypress, Chairman of the Miccosukee Tribe of
Indians of Florida, a federally-recognized tribe located in the heart
of the Everglades and Big Cypress National Preserve. I appreciate the
opportunity to discuss the importance of the Big Cypress National
Preserve to the Miccosukee people and how wilderness designations in
this Preserve would fundamentally alter our way of life.
The views expressed herein are those of the Miccosukee Tribe, a
sovereign tribe recognized pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act of
1934.
We support H.R. 8206, which would prevent Big Cypress National
Preserve from being designated as wilderness. While wilderness
designations are in theory designed as conservation tools, they have
developed a troubling history with respect to their impact on
Indigenous peoples. Wilderness designations have plagued Indian Country
ever since the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964. The impact of
wilderness designations, too often, is to dispossess native people of
their lands in the name of conservation. That is because the Wilderness
Act is designed to prevent occupancy, permanent improvements, or
mechanized vehicle usage on designated lands. As a result, Natives
still living on traditional lands have been removed, harassed, and
convicted of crimes related to their traditional practices under the
Wilderness Act. Big Cypress National Preserve is one of the few places
in the nation where Tribal rights reserved by treaty or statute are in
conflict with a proposed wilderness designation.
The Tribe supports H.R. 8206, which would prevent the Wilderness
Act from being applied in the Big Cypress. The Wilderness Act must not
be applied to the Big Cypress National Preserve, ever. Big Cypress,
occupying an area larger than the State of Rhode Island, was created as
the nation's first multi-use preserve. Congress's intent was to allow
for uses that would be prohibited in typical National Parks. The
essential reasons for creating a multi-use Preserve are in complete
tension with the limited uses allowed in wilderness areas. By
preventing a wilderness designation, we can ensure that Big Cypress
will continue to be serve the purposes for which it was created, with
indigenous inhabitants to steward its lands; access for the public to
experience its abundance and beauty; and effective management of
invasive and exotic species.
Big Cypress is home for Native American People

There are 15 remaining traditional Miccosukee and Seminole villages
in Big Cypress National Preserve, as well as several ceremonial
grounds, burial grounds and gathering sites in every park unit within
the Preserve. We live here. Our ancestors fought and died here. They
are buried here. The Big Cypress is part of us and we are a part of it.
The 1974 Enabling Legislation of Big Cypress National Preserve
recognizes this history, providing that ``members of the Miccosukee
Tribe of Indians of Florida and members of the Seminole Tribe of
Florida shall be permitted, subject to reasonable regulations
established by the Secretary, to continue their usual and customary use
and occupancy of Federal or federally acquired lands and waters within
the preserve and the Addition, including hunting, fishing, and trapping
on a subsistence basis and traditional tribal ceremonials.'' Public Law
93-440 (Oct. 11, 1974).
Our ancestors determined that it is the duty of every tribal member
to preserve and protect our lands. To that end, we are leading or
partnered on multiple projects to protect, preserve, and restore our
ancestral lands. We are negotiating a co-management agreement with the
National Park Service so that we can police the entire Preserve,
protect it from poachers and polluters, and provide support for the
enforcement of Preserve regulations. We are also working with the Army
Corps of Engineers to rehydrate the Western Everglades, including parts
of the Big Cypress National Preserve through the Comprehensive
Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). We are finally in the driver's
seat.
Now, the National Park Service is proposing a 147,000-192,000-acre
wilderness designation on top of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians and
Seminole Tribe of Florida's reserved rights within Big Cypress National
Preserve. We have been forced to gather the support of several other
tribes and Native non-profits to oppose this taking of tribal rights.
Nevertheless, we fear that the National Park Service is now awaiting an
opportune political moment to utilize the Wilderness Act to erode
Miccosukee tribal sovereignty.
Miccosukee have seen this before

It should come as no surprise that the Miccosukee experience with
federal policy surrounding our homelands has been, historically,
negative and rife with prejudice. For example, a 99,000-acre
reservation in Monroe County, granted to the Miccosukee, was revoked
when Everglades National Park was created. The Tribe no longer has
hunting and fishing rights within Everglades National Park and must get
permission to access historic tree islands within the Park for
religious, cultural, or burial purposes. In Everglades National Park,
we rely on the charity and good grace of the federal government. We
understand and appreciate the trust responsibility that continues to be
honored, but we are cognizant of the fact that shifts in society,
policy, the law of the land, or even a new Superintendent can threaten
our way of life.
This is what is at stake in Big Cypress for Miccosukee. This is
what a Wilderness Designation can affect. Wilderness is a threat to
tribal sovereignty because the plain language of the statute prohibits
``permanent improvement,'' human habitation, and requires the federal
government to make ``the imprint of man's work substantially
unnoticeable.'' The Miccosukee experience tells us that we shape the
land, we live within it, and we should make it better with our lives
for future generations.
This is why we see the Wilderness Act's statutory framework as
being in direct conflict with our way of life: instead of relying on
tribal knowledge and resources to ensure that land can continue to be
managed and used in accordance with the traditional ways, a wilderness
designation seeks to separate land from its Indigenous stewards.
Wilderness isn't always good for tribes or for conservation: Examples
of Legal Conflicts in other Park Units

Placing a legal obstacle between tribes and their rights to use and
occupy ancestral lands means that tribal members face an impossible
choice: complying with restrictions that impede their ability to use
and manage their ancestral lands, or risking prosecution.
This isn't just conjecture. Federal courts have grappled with these
very issues before, and the rulings have not come down in favor of
tribes. Federal courts have created a ``minimum requirements test''
that has a very narrow allowance for any deviation from the black
letter standards of the Wilderness Act. In United States v. Gotchnik,
222 F.3d 506 (8th Cir. 2000), two members of the Bois Forte Band of
Chippewa Indians were prosecuted for using motorized vehicles to cross
wilderness areas to exercise their treaty-protected rights to tribal
fishing waters. They were tried and convicted.
Relatedly, wilderness designations have in some cases been used by
environmental groups as tools to prevent agencies from taking actions
to save species or adequately manage invasive species. In Wilderness
Watch v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife, 629 F.3d 1024 (9th Cir. 2010), the
U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service built two water tanks on Wilderness lands
to help save the Bighorn Sheep population from severe drought in Kofa
National Wildlife Refuge. The Ninth Circuit rejected the adequacy of
the Service's analysis and deemed the tanks in potential violation of
the Wilderness Act without further justification by the Service.
Negotiations or accords do not reliably yield adequate
accommodations for tribes when attempted. The Ramah District of Navajo
Nation entered into an agreement with the Bureau of Land Management to
access their ancestral lands at El Malpais National Conservation Area
attempting to comply with the minimum requirements test set by federal
courts related to wilderness lands. This agreement allowed tribal
citizens to use a vehicle on the outer perimeter of the area but
limited the times of year for potential access, prohibited large
gatherings of tribal citizens, and required permission from Bureau of
Land Management staff to access their ancestral lands. The federal land
manager reported that the Ramah Navajo did not request access to El
Malpais for their ceremonies for 12 years after this narrow and
restrictive agreement was reached.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wilderness designation applied to the Big Cypress threatens all of
these harms to Miccosukee and the environment

There have been assurances from the National Park Service and from
the administration that their application of the Wilderness Act would
not affect tribal rights to use and occupancy guaranteed to the
Miccosukee and Seminole Tribe in the Big Cypress enacting legislation.
But the National Park Service's policies on wilderness state that
special management protocols start early in the process of considering
an area for designation as wilderness. According to National Park
Service Director Order #41, ``[t]hroughout the study process, eligible
lands continue to be managed to preserve their eligibility for
designation by protecting their wilderness character,'' and we would
anticipate that this policy would support many more restrictions on
tribal activity in Big Cypress than are in place today in order to
create the conditions required for a wilderness designation.
We fear that application of the Wilderness Act to the Big Cypress
would prevent motorized access by Miccosukee tribal members to their
ancestral lands. We fear that wilderness will prevent continued large
gatherings at our sacred ceremonial grounds in the Big Cypress. We fear
that wilderness will prevent adequate management of the invasive
pythons that permeate Big Cypress wetlands and hammocks. We fear that
wilderness will prevent the Miccosukee, the State of Florida, and
federal agencies from addressing invasive and exotic flora (e.g.
Brazilian Pepper, Melaleuca) which covered more than half the Preserve
in the 1990s and have only been pushed back by mechanical means,
resulting in an altered ecosystem within the Big Cypress and thwarting
the progress made to stop their spread over the last 50 years.
More fundamentally, our concern with a wilderness designation is
that it hinders our ability to influence management of these lands, and
threatens to obstruct our traditional religious observance and way of
life. Our children will not be able to enjoy the fruits of their
ancestral lands. They will not see her beauty up close; we will not be
able to harvest our medicine, and we will not be able to bury our dead
traditionally. Our annual religious festivals will only continue on
federal lands if we violate federal law. That is injustice and does not
reflect the highest ideals of the United States in the 21st century of
fulfilling promises made to sovereign tribes.

This is the sacred land of the Miccosukee, this is our home, this is
our responsibility. Don't just force regulation and designations on my
people, follow our lead. Permit us to guide you to the right path
forward in the Big Cypress.
Conclusion

I am optimistic that the Tribe, Congress, and the Park Service can
continue to do what's right for our Mother Everglades and our sacred
land, the Big Cypress. But designating, or proposing to designate, any
part of the Big Cypress as wilderness is not the right answer.
I truly appreciate the opportunity to address this Subcommittee and
thank you for the support you have shown to tribes and their
sovereignty. I look forward to any questions you may have.
______

Dr. Gosar. Thank you very much, Chairman Cypress. I now
recognize Justin Lemoine, the Executive Director of the, I am
going to try to get this right, Atchafalaya National Heritage
Area.
Mr. Lemoine, you now have 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF JUSTIN LEMOINE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ATCHAFALAYA
NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA, BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA

Mr. Lemoine. Good morning, members of the Subcommittee. My
name is Justin Lemoine. I am the Executive Director of the
Atchafalaya National Heritage Area.
I want to thank Congressman Scalise for introducing H.R.
6843, and for his ongoing support of our heritage area program.
I am respectfully submitting this testimony to support
expanding the boundaries of the Atchafalaya National Heritage
Area to include Lafourche Parish.
Lafourche Parish leadership approached our staff in 2021
with the desire to expand the boundary of our heritage area to
include their parish, as it was not included in the original
2006 legislation. Lafourche is the only parish through which
Bayou Lafourche flows that is not included in the heritage
area. Bayou Lafourche represents the eastern boundary of the
historic Atchafalaya Basin. This effort is supported by
Lafourche Parish Government; Nicholls State University; our
governing body, the Atchafalaya Trace Commission; the Louisiana
Landowners Association; the office of Lieutenant Governor Billy
Nungesser; many private entities, community groups, and all of
the cities and towns within the parish.
Our program is housed within the Louisiana Department of
Culture, Recreation, and Tourism, and works closely with the
Offices of Tourism, Parks, and Cultural Development. We also
work very closely with the State's Coastal Protection and
Restoration Authority, Louisiana Economic Development, the
Department of Education, the National Park Service, public
universities, and many local municipalities throughout our 14
parishes.
Our work annually leverages the Federal investment at well
above the one-to-one required match. The program provides
technical and financial assistance to local communities, and
helps to lead efforts related to cultural interpretation,
environmental stewardship, recreation enhancement, historic
preservation, and strengthening the region's identity. Our 14
parishes in south central Louisiana began at the confluence of
the Mississippi and Red Rivers, where 41 percent of the waters
in North America drain. From there, the Atchafalaya winds south
through the Acadiana region, paralleling the Mississippi River
as it heads to the Gulf of Mexico. Like the Atchafalaya River,
Bayou Lafourche is also a tributary of the Mississippi River.
The heritage area is comprised of four regions: the upper;
the area between two rivers; the Bayou Teche Corridor; and
finally, the coastal region. If this legislation is passed,
Lafourche Parish will join the parishes of Saint Mary,
Assumption, Terrebonne, and the coastal region. Lafourche
covers most of the length of Bayou Lafourche, and abuts
immediately Ascension and Terrebonne Parishes and the Gulf of
Mexico. It was originally the northern part of Lafourche
Interior Parish which consisted of the present-day parishes of
Lafourche and Terrebonne. The parish is tied closely to
Assumption and Ascension parishes, both culturally and
physically, through its connection with the Bayou Lafourche.
The Fresh Water District manages water quality,
accessibility, drinking water, and agricultural supplies, and
much more, while the friends group raises awareness and
importance of Bayou Lafourche and its revitalization through
education, outreach, and recreation improvements. ANHA has a
long-standing partnership with both organizations in Assumption
and Ascension Parishes, and hopes to continue that work through
Lafourche Parish.
The heritage area is a partner in the recently-designated-
by-NOAA Estuarine Research Reserve, with partners like the
University of Louisiana at Lafayette and LUMCON, the Louisiana
Marine Consortium of Universities. Nicholls State University, a
university in Lafourche Parish, would be an addition to that
team, and the Atchafalaya Heritage Area Program would be a
foundational partner in this network for education and
interpretation of this habitat and its connection to our
culture.
Lafourche Parish and its many cultural and natural assets
weave together with Terrebonne, Assumption, Ascension, and the
other heritage area parishes to preserve and promote the
authentic and important regional culture. The addition of
Lafourche Parish, a region that so fully honors our water story
and our French language cultural themes throughout the entire
Atchafalaya National Heritage Area, would allow the program to
tell a more complete story of this unique piece of the nation's
history. Thank you.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Lemoine follows:]
Prepared Statement of Justin K. Lemoine, Executive Director,
Atchafalaya National Heritage Area
on H.R. 6843

Chairman Westerman, Ranking Member Grijalva, Subcommittee Chairman
Tiffany, Vice Chairman Curtis, and other distinguished members of the
Subcommittee, my name is Justin Lemoine, and I am the Executive
Director of the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area (ANHA), a nationally
significant landscape stretching from the confluence of the Mississippi
and Red Rivers in Central Louisiana to the Gulf of Mexico at Morgan
City.
Your past and continued support of the National Heritage Area
program is greatly appreciated. I am respectfully submitting testimony
to support H.R. 6843, To expand the boundaries of the Atchafalaya
National Heritage Area to include Lafourche Parish, Louisiana
introduced by Representative Steve Scalise. S. 3542, a companion bill,
has been introduced by Senator Bill Cassidy.
Constituents of Lafourche Parish approached Atchafalaya National
Heritage Area staff in 2021 with a desire to expand the boundary of the
heritage area to include the region as, though physically and
culturally connected to the heritage area, it was not included in the
original 2006 enabling legislation. A review by ANHA staff revealed
that Lafourche is the only parish through which Bayou Lafourche flows
that is not included in the heritage area. Bayou Lafourche represents
the eastern boundary of the historic Atchafalaya Basin. The Louisiana
Landowners Association, Lafourche Parish Government, Nicholls State
University, the Atchafalaya Trace Commission (governing body of the
Atchafalaya National Heritage Area), the Office of Lieutenant Governor
Billy Nungesser, private entities, community groups, and the cities and
towns within Lafourche Parish have offered support of this boundary
expansion legislation.
Atchafalaya National Heritage Area Overview

The Atchafalaya National Heritage Area (ANHA) program is housed
within the Louisiana Office of Cultural Development, an office of the
Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism. The ANHA
program works closely with the Office of Tourism, the Office of State
Parks, and the many divisions within the Office of Cultural Development
to amplify their work and fulfill the ANHA program's goals of
supporting cultural, natural, and recreational resource preservation
and enhancement. Outside of its state agency, ANHA also works closely
with the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority,
Louisiana Economic Development, the Louisiana Department of Education,
and other state agencies, local municipalities, and public educational
institutions in fulfillment of its mission. ANHA's work annually
leverages the federal investment at well above the 1:1 match
requirement. Since its authorization, the program has provided
technical and financial assistance to local communities throughout its
parishes and helped to lead efforts related to cultural interpretation,
environmental stewardship, recreation enhancement, historic
preservation, and strengthening the region's identity.
The ANHA is comprised of 14 parishes in south central Louisiana.
The heritage area was first conceptualized as a driving loop called the
Atchafalaya Trace with a path looping around the Atchafalaya Basin
floodway. This path would highlight this signature water resource and
its role in the region's culture and economy. In the late 1990s, the
Louisiana legislature designated the Atchafalaya Trace as a state
heritage area. With broad local and state support, in 2006 the
Atchafalaya National Heritage Area was designated by Congress.
As the namesake of the heritage area, the Atchafalaya River and
Basin is the centerpiece of a region whose extensive network of
waterways strongly influence the region's culture and identity. South
Louisiana's water story is a core theme of the ANHA program. Those who
called the region home throughout history cultivated and continue to
nourish a unique culture along these waterways. Often identified by the
popular terms `Cajun' and `Creole,' the regional identity is a result
of the intersection of Native American, African, European, Caribbean,
and Acadian exiles whose language and traditions come together in this
dynamic alluvial region. The strong language influence of these
cultures developed the local Louisiana French dialect and the Kouri-
Vini languages. Woven with other regional cultural characteristics,
like the food and music, and this area has earned its moniker
`America's Foreign Country.'
The Geographical History of the Heritage Area

At its northern end, the heritage area begins with the Mississippi
River delta and the historic confluence of the Mississippi and Red
Rivers. From there, the Atchafalaya River winds through the Acadiana
region, paralleling the Mississippi River as it winds south to the Gulf
of Mexico at Morgan City. This southern portion of the heritage area is
often called Bayou Country. Like the Atchafalaya River, Bayou Lafourche
is also a distributary of the Mississippi River. This key waterway, a
former path of the Mississippi River, has historically been used for
commercial and recreational navigation. Bayou Lafourche also provides
clean drinking water to thousands in the region and serves the
agricultural economy. The bayou contributes to marsh nourishment and
land building along Louisiana's delicate coastline thanks to the
sediment and nutrient-laden waters it receives from the Mississippi
River at Donaldsonville.
At the junction of the Mississippi, Red, and Atchafalaya Rivers,
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Old River Control Complex
for flood mitigation. Built over the course of nearly half a century,
this 5-structure complex was intended to stabilize the Mississippi
River's path and maintain regional navigation for commercial shipping
vessels. If not for the construction of this complex in the 20th
century, the Mississippi River would most certainly have changed
courses from its current path to that of the Atchafalaya River,
bypassing major port cities of Baton Rouge and New Orleans and
adversely impacting commerce and industry for the entire central United
States.
The complexity of the Atchafalaya Basin's water story goes further
back in time and includes the history of Louisiana's native peoples,
early European settlers' use of it for navigation, and ultimately the
ongoing fight for flood control. This fight began as efforts of
individual property owners, then local and state entities. After the
Flood of 1927, Congress mandated flood control and mitigation as the
responsibility of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The continued
efforts to manage the Mississippi River and its many tributaries and
distributaries help to ensure that the lands in the states along their
many courses are inhabitable and that their fertile delta soils are a
productive part of the United States' robust agricultural economy.
After decades of public input, the U.S. Congress and the Corps
transformed the largest freshwater swamp in North America, the
Atchafalaya Basin. What was once an area that stretched from Bayou
Teche on the west to Bayou Lafourche on the east was now a fraction of
its original size. This new floodway became a critical component of the
USACE's efforts to control flooding along the Mississippi and Red
Rivers which drain 41% of the continental US.
The Regions of the Heritage Area

The Atchafalaya National Heritage Area is comprised of four
regions: the Upper Region, the Area Between Two Rivers, the Bayou Teche
Corridor, and the Coastal Region. Each region's relationship to water
is based upon its location along the Atchafalaya's varied hydrologic
system.

The Upper Region, which forms the beginning of the ANHA, includes
the parishes of Concordia, Avoyelles, and Pointe Coupee. Concordia
Parish, the northernmost point of the Upper Region, has rivers on three
sides that merge into one river. The parish is contained within levee
borders except for one side and has 300 miles of waterbodies
surrounding it. Lakes and rivers provide an abundance of water sports
and recreation while wildlife refuges make hunting and fishing popular.
Fertile, rich soil makes agriculture, music, historical agricultural
homesites, and museums the area's main attractions. Vidalia sits on the
banks of the Mississippi River.
Avoyelles Parish is south of Concordia Parish and contains the
banks of the old Mississippi River channel. Avoyelles Parish is home to
Grand Cote National Wildlife Refuge, Lake Ophelia National Wildlife
Refuge, Spring Bayou Wildlife Management Area, and other public lands.
ANHA's work in Avoyelles includes recreation improvements for paddle
access within public lands and creative placemaking initiatives in the
form of public art. The area was originally settled in 300 BC and today
is known for its traditions in music, food, and culture. Native
Americans play a significant role in this area evidenced by the
presence of three large pre-historic burial mounds. The parish is home
to the federally recognized Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana.
Pointe Coupee Parish is home to one of the oldest settlements in
the Mississippi River Valley and enjoys Creole culture at its finest.
False River, a lake located in the parish, is an example of an oxbow
lake formed when the Mississippi changed its course and cut off its
former path. The landscape in Pointe Coupee consists of prairies and
back swamp and also includes the Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge.
It is the physical location of the Morganza Spillway, one of the main
control systems the Army Corps of Engineers has in place to handle
major flooding. It is designed to divert water during floods from the
Mississippi River to the Atchafalaya Basin. The Morganza Spillway is a
human-made structure designed to prevent the Mississippi River from
forming a new channel to the Gulf of Mexico via the Atchafalaya River.
Here, ANHA interprets the water story through a series of interpretive
kiosks and supports community festivals and events.

The Between Two Rivers region consists of four parishes: East Baton
Rouge, West Baton Rouge, Ascension, and Iberville. The Baton Rouge
parishes were originally settled in 8000 BC. These parishes were home
to the Houmas and Bayougoula tribes. Baton Rouge, the capital of
Louisiana, is in East Baton Rouge Parish, and it is also home to a
state rural life museum, Louisiana State University, and Southern
University.
Across the river, West Baton Rouge Parish is home to the Cinclare
Plantation Historic District, a sugar cane mill with a town of its own,
and Port Allen. In Port Allen, you will find the Port Allen Lock which
connects the Mississippi River to the Intracoastal Waterway. It also
has several sites of interest including the West Baton Rouge Museum,
the city of Port Allen Railroad Depot, Mississippi Riverfront
Development, Scott's Cemetery, and the Port of Greater Baton Rouge.
Iberville Parish is a rural parish that is emblematic of humans
living in harmony with the natural environment. Waterways are a
dominant theme in the parish. The Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge
is found in Iberville parish as well as the Mississippi River, bayous,
and entrances to the 800,000 acres of the Atchafalaya Basin. Here, ANHA
has partnered with community groups to host cultural festivals, develop
multi-use cultural museums, and enhance outdoor recreation.
Ascension Parish covers over 300 square miles and spans both banks
of the Mississippi River. Several Native American tribes settled in
this area as hunters and farmers. They were known to use pottery,
baskets, and ceramics. Later, they were joined by the Acadians from
Nova Scotia who were exiled and eventually settled in this part of the
region. These groups were joined by many diverse settlers, such as
French, Italian, Spanish, German, African, and English, to name a few.
Once again, traditions melded together to create the rich Cajun culture
of the area.

The Bayou Teche Corridor consists of four parishes: St. Landry, St.
Martin, Iberia, and Lafayette. St. Landry Parish has a long history
dating back to prehistoric times. Two distinct Native American tribes,
the Appalousa, and the Attakapas, lived between the Atchafalaya and
Sabine Rivers. This area later became home to Acadians, French,
Spanish, Caribbean, French Creoles, Spanish Creoles, and Africans. In
1805, it was established as the largest parish in Louisiana but later
was divided into six parishes that include Calcasieu, Evangeline, Jeff
Davis, Beauregard, and Allen. Nationally protected areas in St. Landry
Parish are the Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge and the Jean
Lafitte National Historical Park Site. ANHA partners with cultural
organizations to preserve the area's unique Zydeco and Cajun music
assets and native plant groups to interpret the delicate Cajun prairie
ecosystem.
St. Martin Parish is unique in that it has three distinct
geographical areas--the Atchafalaya Basin, the prairie, and the Bayou
Teche area. St. Martin Parish reflects the beauty of nature in its bald
cypress trees, oak trees, moss, sugarcane fields, low-lying swamp, and
endless environment of lakes and rivers. ``Evangeline'' by Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow, tells of a young woman sitting on the banks of
Bayou Teche. The ANHA program has helped to interpret the story of
Evangeline while helping to preserve historic sites and enhance access
to cultural resources within the parish.
Originally settled by the Spanish, Iberia Parish is known for its
Cajun, Creole, and Asian cuisine. It also has several tourist
attractions such as tropical tours on tranquil islands, swamp tours,
stately home tours, outdoor sport and recreation options, the famous
Tabasco factory tours, festivals, fais do do street dances, fishing
rodeos, cook-offs, and much more.
Concluding the Bayou Teche Corridor parishes is Lafayette Parish,
the smallest parish in Louisiana. The French-speaking Acadians and
Creoles of African, West Indian, and European descent settled in this
area and brought their Roman Catholic belief system. Lafayette is the
heart of Acadiana and the Cajun and Creole cultures are its lifeblood.
It is a place where music, dance, love of family, storytelling, food,
and joie de vivre reign supreme. Lafayette is a place that reflects the
past through the present with beautiful scenery and a culture that
lives on but adapts to the challenges of each season with strength and
a determination to survive. Lafayette is also the home of the
University of Louisiana at Lafayette (ULL). Here, ANHA partners with
the Center for Louisiana Studies at ULL to compile the stories that
make up Louisiana's cumulative history and ensure that resources are
available in person and print for generations to come.

The parishes of St. Mary, Assumption, and Terrebonne make up the
Coastal Region. St. Mary Parish is 613 square miles of land and 506
square miles of water and is recognized as a gateway to the Atchafalaya
Basin. This parish is also home to Bayou Teche and the Bayou Teche
National Wildlife Refuge. The earliest settlers of the coastal region
were the Chitimacha Tribe who settled near the area bayous. Their name
means ``people of many waters.'' Their diet consisted of corn for
hominy meal, fish, wild game, and shellfish of the area. The tribe is
well-known for its baskets made with wild cane reed dyed naturally and
woven into geometric designs. Today the reservation encompasses 283
acres of land with 350 tribal members. Other groups that settled in
this parish were Dutch, English, Acadians, German, Danish, and Irish.
The numerous sugar plantations and sugar mills made this area an
important sugar port. The sugar industry continues to thrive today
through modern agricultural practices. St. Mary Parish has also been a
vital source of shrimp, fish, seafood processing, salt, boat building,
oil, gas, carbon black, and was once home to the world's largest
cypress sawmill.
Assumption Parish has natural waterways that connect the
Mississippi Industrial Corridor to the north and the Gulf of Mexico in
the south, while also providing a gateway to the Atchafalaya Basin.
Assumption Parish is known for its rivers, bayous, sugar, agriculture,
estuaries, scenery, recreation, historic communities, agricultural
industry, and ties to the French and Spanish cultures. The Louisiana
French language is still spoken throughout the parish and will be a
feature of a new interpretive center in development by local community
champions through a partnership with ANHA.
Terrebonne Parish is the second largest parish in Louisiana and its
entire southern coast is on the Gulf of Mexico. Over ninety percent of
the parish is wetlands or open water. The parish is home to the
Mandalay National Wildlife Refuge and Terrebonne Bay, as well as many
bayous and waterways including the Intracoastal Waterway. The
inhabitants of Terrebonne, like those of neighboring Lafourche, have
always lived on what nature provided. Terrebonne oysters are known
internationally as some of the finest oysters in the world. Seafood (20
percent of all Louisiana seafood), wildlife (hunting and trapping),
sugar cane, sugar mills, fur trading, logging, and oil and gas have
long provided a livelihood for the residents. Terrebonne Parish is
recognized as being a gateway port for one of the heaviest
concentrations of offshore oil service companies in the state. The
Houmas tribe were some of the first settlers in this area, followed by
the Acadians (exiled French colonists) and the Spanish. The authentic
Acadian culture, diverse environment, wildlife, agriculture, historic
homesteads, seafood, natural mineral resources, and unique location
offer many educational, recreational, and economic opportunities in
today's world.
Lafourche Parish

Lafourche Parish covers nearly all the length of Bayou Lafourche
and immediately abuts Assumption and Terrebonne parishes and the Gulf
of Mexico. Early European settlers explored the waterway known as
``LaFourche Des Chetimachas,'' the fork of the Chitimachas, which was
eventually shortened to ``Lafourche,'' hence the name of the parish and
the bayou that bisects it. The parish is located within the Barataria
and Terrebonne estuaries. Bayou Lafourche, or Fork Bayou, is a
distributary of the Mississippi River. Lafourche has 1,068 square miles
of land area and 406 square miles of open water and is the eighth-
largest parish in Louisiana by total area. It was originally the
northern part of Lafourche Interior Parish, which consisted of the
present parishes of Lafourche and Terrebonne.

Louisiana's coastal parishes house a wealth of economic industries
ranging from oil and gas to seafood to water-based recreation and
hunting. Lafourche Parish is home to many public waters and public
lands including East Timbalier Island National Wildlife Refuge, Lake
Boeuf Wildlife Management Area, and Pointe-aux-Chenes Wildlife
Management Area. Port Fourchon, a bustling port terminal where Bayou
Lafourche meets the Gulf of Mexico is not only a hub for the state's
energy industry, but also an access point for recreational activities
with developed recreational infrastructure.

Lafourche Parish is home to many historic communities including the
city of Thibodaux and the towns of Lockport and Golden Meadow. E.D.
White State Historic Site, a public museum located along Bayou
Lafourche, depicts the history of the parish, the agricultural industry
in the region, the many cultures of Lafourche, and the enslavement of
peoples as a part of the region's agricultural development. The site is
a reminder of the region's past that intrinsically ties the present to
life on the water. The parish is filled with dozens of historic sites,
all connected to the cumulative cultural identity of the Atchafalaya
region.

The Jean Lafitte National Park and Preserve Wetlands Acadian
Cultural Center (WACC) is located on Bayou Lafourche in Thibodaux, the
seat of the parish. The WACC tells the story of the Acadian exiles who
settled along Louisiana's bayous and created a distinctive Cajun
culture based on life in a watery realm. The center shares their way of
life through a film, special and permanent exhibits, musical
performances, and boat tours of Bayou Lafourche that connect to other
important sites like the E.D. White State Historic Site.

Bayou Lafourche, which begins at Donaldsonville in Ascension
Parish, is the parish's central waterway. Once a natural distributary
of the Mississippi River, it now is controlled by a pump station where
it begins at the Mississippi. Lafourche is inextricably tied to
Assumption and Ascension Parishes culturally and physically through
Bayou Lafourche. The Bayou Lafourche Fresh Water District (BLFWD) is
tasked with management of the waterway. The district balances water
quality, water quantity, recreational accessibility, drinking and
agricultural water supplies, and coastal nourishment through a
comprehensive management strategy. The Friends of Bayou Lafourche is a
nonprofit organization whose mission is to raise the awareness of the
importance of Bayou Lafourche and its revitalization through education
and informational outreach, and by the creation of recreation and
beautification opportunities along the bayou. ANHA has partnered with
both organizations in nearby Assumption and Ascension parishes
throughout its history and would continue that work into Lafourche
Parish upon approval of boundary expansion.

The commercial fishing industries in Lafourche Parish are strongly
connected to those in neighboring parishes within the ANHA. The coastal
fishing industry has been active for as long as the region has been
inhabited. Native Americans lived off the land and flourished in this
watery region. Their foodways and cultural traditions continue to this
day. Early Europeans and newly re-settled Acadians made home along
Bayou Lafourche. Their lifeways of hunting, fishing, and trapping have
been handed down through time. Many commercial operations are family-
owned and have been passed down from generation to generation. These
fishermen are often born and raised in the area and rarely leave the
bayou region. They are the torchbearers of the bayou culture of
Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes and the seafood they catch
contributes to the state's robust seafood industry. Lafourche lies in
the heart of the state's vast coastal wetlands. These bayous,
marshlands, and fertile farmlands are defining features of this area
and create an ideal environment for many seafood species including
shrimp, crabs, oysters, and finfish.

Water-based recreation along the coast includes recreational
fishing, ecotourism, and passive recreational boating throughout the
vast wetlands and marshes. These waterways play a vital role in the
culture and the region's sportsman economy. Tour groups and charter
fishing businesses work with the parish's tourism agency, Louisiana's
Cajun Bayou and those in Terrebonne, Assumption, and St. Mary parishes
to teach residents and visitors about the value of the ecosystem.
Nicholls State University is situated in the city of Thibodaux. The
university is currently building a new coastal center that, together
with other state universities, will drive research and innovation on
best practices for coastal management. The University, along with the
Barataria Terrebonne National Estuary Program (BTNEP), utilizes an
applied science approach along with community engagement to help tackle
the many challenges facing this delicate region. ANHA has a seat on
BTNEP's quarterly management conference board.

The Louisiana National Estuarine Research Reserve site, recently
designated by NOAA, further offers unique opportunities for partnership
between the ANHA and organizations located in the heritage area's
coastal parishes. The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium
(LUMCON), Nicholls State University, the heritage area, and other
regional groups in St. Mary, Terrebonne, and Lafourche parish, will
work with the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority
(CPRA) to partner on educational, outreach, and research opportunities
for implementation of the LaNERR management plan. The Atchafalaya
National Heritage Area serves as a vital partner in this network for
historical and ecological interpretation as the estuarine environment
provides yet another example of the critical waterbodies of the
heritage area and the culture it nourishes. The history of the region's
development, how the people have lived off the land, and the challenges
they continue to face in a dynamic coastal environment are what weave
these coastal parishes together like a traditional Chitimacha basket.

The Cajun identity that is strong throughout the Atchafalaya region
is found in Louisiana's Cajun Bayou: Lafourche Parish. Cajun music is
an art form unique to South Louisiana. While the once robust Cajun
music scene has faded over time, advocates are working hard to sustain
these traditions for future generations. The Cajun Music Preservation
Society (CMPS) was formed to ensure that traditional Cajun music
remains part of the vibrant culture in Lafourche for decades to come by
promoting traditional Cajun music, hosting live Cajun jams, and hosting
the Swamp Stomp Music Series. Adding Lafourche to the heritage area
boundary will enable the program staff to better engage with
organizations like CMPS to further preserve and enhance these cultural
organizations and amplify their impact. Lafourche is also home to the
Cajun Heritage Festival, a yearly event where locals express their
memory and talent in the form of wooden carvings. This event serves as
an educational program to teach younger generations about the wildlife
and culture of the region.

Lafourche Parish and its many cultural assets weave together with
Terrebonne, Assumption, and Ascension parishes to preserve and promote
the authentic and important Cajun culture. Incorporating Lafourche
Parish into the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area will enable the
program to support, preserve, and enhance the cultural, natural, and
recreational resources as it does throughout the area. To best serve
the bayou area, the program must be able to work throughout the entire
community. Water and culture know no boundaries. The addition of
Lafourche Parish, a region that so fully honors the water and French-
language themes of the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area, would allow
ANHA staff to tell a more complete story of this unique piece of the
nation's history.

Dr. Gosar. Thanks, Mr. Lemoine. I now recognize Ms.
Katherine Andrews, the Director of the Office of Outdoor
Recreation at the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage, and
Tourism.

Director Andrews, you have 5 minutes. Thank you.

STATEMENT OF KATHERINE ANDREWS, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF OUTDOOR
RECREATION, DEPARTMENT OF PARKS, HERITAGE, AND TOURISM, LITTLE
ROCK, ARKANSAS

Ms. Andrews. Good afternoon, and thank you to my fellow
Arkansans, Chairman Bruce Westerman and Congressman French
Hill, and the entire Committee for inviting me here today. My
name is Katherine Andrews, and I serve as Director of Arkansas'
Office of Outdoor Recreation within the Arkansas Department of
Parks, Heritage, and Tourism. I also chair the Confluence of
States, a bipartisan group of my outdoor recreation
counterparts across the United States.
It is a particular honor to appear before the Natural
Resources Committee again, and I am delighted to testify today
in support of H.R. 3971, the Flatside Wilderness Additions Act.
Arkansas is known as the Natural State for a reason. Our
pristine streams, unspoiled wilderness, and diverse outdoor
recreation opportunities including hiking, biking, floating,
and climbing. Our state boasts the Mountain Bike Capital of the
World, the Duck Hunting Capital of the World, the Trout Capital
of the USA, and we are rapidly becoming the Climbing Capital of
the South. We have the world's longest bayou, the highest
waterfall between the Rockies and the Appalachians, and the
nation's first national river, the Buffalo National River.
Additionally, Arkansas is the only state where you can hunt
both an elk and an alligator in the same state.
Our mission at the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage,
and Tourism is to protect and promote the state's natural,
cultural, and historical resources, contributing to a thriving
economy and enhanced quality of life. There are numerous
benefits associated with areas rich in outdoor recreation, such
as business attraction, workforce retention, public health and
wellness, getting kids outside and off screens, and the
conservation and preservation of our natural assets.
In addition, a robust outdoor recreation industry is not
just a luxury. It is essential and highly impactful. In 2022,
4.3 million visitors, a number larger than the population of
the entire state of Arkansas, spent an estimated $278 million
in local gateway regions while visiting National Park Service
lands in my state. These expenditures supported 3,900 jobs,
$107 million in labor income, and $362 million in economic
output for the Arkansas economy. Visitors and citizens alike
flock to places where they can spend time outside.
Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders has prioritized
improving outdoor experiences, and I, along with the Arkansas
Department of Parks, Heritage, and Tourism, am working
tirelessly to create outdoor recreation opportunities from our
incredible state parks to communities across the state. Their
executive order, the Natural State Initiative, has adopted a
bold approach, involving multi-agency and private partners
working together to break down silos and invite innovation into
our work and public lands.
Access to outdoor recreation inspires generations of
Arkansans to care for and champion the future of our natural
places, ensuring that we remain the Natural State. Our office
serves two main groups: industry and community partners. For
industry partners like bike shops, boat manufacturers, and
outfitters, we provide resources and help overcome growth
barriers. For community partners such as towns and advocacy
groups, we highlight the economic benefits of outdoor
recreation, and assist in securing grants and funding to
enhance their natural assets and infrastructure to attract
visitors and outdoor enthusiasts. This brings me to the reason
I am here today.
I am here to offer the Arkansas Office of Outdoor
Recreation's support of Congressman Hill's legislation, which
would designate approximately 2,200 acres as wilderness, and
add it to the Flatside Wilderness Area, part of the Ouachita
National Forest. The Flatside Wilderness Additions Act
represents the second and final phase to expand the wilderness
area at Flatside. The surrounding area is either part of the
Ouachita National Forest and unsuitable for wilderness
designation, or privately owned, therefore deserving
protection.
The addition to Flatside Wilderness will be a tremendous
benefit to central Arkansas, providing a fantastic destination
for hiking, camping, fishing, and other outdoor activities.
This addition will serve as a cherished outdoor haven,
enriching the quality of life for Arkansans and attracting
nature enthusiasts from far and wide.
As the population of Arkansas grows, the need to expand
outdoor access becomes crucial. Increased access to outdoor
spaces fuels the outdoor economy by encouraging activities like
buying hunting and fishing licenses, hiring guide services, and
purchasing outdoor gear. Additionally, fostering a larger
community dedicated to conservation ensures that these places
and many others will remain protected.
This legislation will open numerous opportunities for young
families and new residents, while providing seasoned residents
with joy and adventure in a cherished location. It will also
offer access to the rugged Ouachita Mountains and clear
streams, providing hiking and other recreational opportunities
for all.
On behalf of the Office of Outdoor Recreation and the
Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage, and Tourism, we support
this proposed legislation and ask for your support, as well.
Thank you.

Mr. Tiffany [presiding]. Thank you, Director Andrews.
Finally, I would like to recognize Mr. Sean Kelleher,
Historian for the town of Saratoga in New York.
Mr. Kelleher, you have 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF SEAN KELLEHER, HISTORIAN, TOWN OF SARATOGA,
SARATOGA, NEW YORK

Mr. Kelleher. Thank you to the Committee for allowing this
testimony. My name is Sean Kelleher. I am the Historian for the
Town of Saratoga, and I am here to urge your support for H.R.
390, the Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley National
Heritage Area Enhancement Act.
This is a critical piece of legislation that will help
preserve our country's history and drive economic growth in the
Hudson River Valley. The Town of Saratoga is committed to
initiatives that enhance our economic, historic, and
environmental well-being. The inclusion in the Hudson River
National Heritage Area will significantly bolster our efforts
to preserve our rich heritage, while fostering sustainable
development and tourism.
The opportunity is particularly timely as we approach the
250th anniversary of the American Revolution, and in 2027 will
commemorate the pivotal events of the Battles of Saratoga.
These battles played a critical role in shaping our nation's
history, and continue to be a source of pride and education not
only for our country, but across the world.
The Saratoga campaign in 1777 was a pivotal act of the
American Revolutionary War. British General John Burgoyne led
an army to seize control of the significant Hudson River
Valley. However, that campaign culminated with a defeat at the
Battles of Saratoga, forcing a surrender to the American
General Horatio Gates on October 17, 1777. This was an
unprecedented event. It was the first time in world history a
complete British army surrendered, and it had far-reaching
consequences. It enabled Benjamin Franklin to secure vital
foreign assistance, especially from France, that made the
various countries coming to the American cause, but it also
transformed our American Revolution into a global war spanning
North America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, and Europe.
The Battles of Saratoga were monumentally significant, and
it breathed life into the ideals set forth in our Declaration
of Independence. Until this point, the principles of freedom
and self-governance were merely words on a page, on a piece of
paper. But the American victory at Saratoga demonstrated the
viability of these ideas not just for our fledgling nation, but
for all of humanity. And it proved that the concepts of liberty
and independence could be triumphed against what were seemingly
insurmountable odds, and it set a powerful precedent for future
generations.
The Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area was
established 28 years ago. It encompassed 10 counties in the
Village of Waterford in Saratoga County. The primary purpose of
this heritage area was to commemorate the American Revolution
and highlight the ongoing commitment to the fundamental human
rights of liberty, equality, and dignity.
However, the original heritage area boundaries were
determined based upon congressional districts, rather than
recognizing the historical significant areas within the Hudson
Valley. Over time, the heritage area location has evolved
administratively to incorporate Saratoga National Historical
Park, which our county would like to see renamed as Saratoga
National Battlefield. But it is crucial to note that, while the
national park was added, the surrounding communities, which
witnessed some of the actual combat and where the British
surrendered, were not included. So, this is an opportunity for
Congress to expand that area to include that.
In conclusion, this law calls for the expansion of three
simple words, but it will allow and empower our communities to
better collaborate with both Federal and state agencies and
achieve our common goal. By supporting H.R. 390, you won't
throw away your shot to correct this historical oversight, and
we can boost our local economies and ensure a future that can
be fully appreciated.
I invite you to visit Saratoga County and witness our
historical significance, and see our community as we are
preparing for the 250th commemoration of the Battles of
Saratoga.
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity for this

Prepared Statement of Sean Kelleher, Historian, Town of Saratoga, NY
on H.R. 390

I stand before you today to urge your support for H.R. 390, the
``Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area
Enhancement Act,'' a critical piece of legislation that will preserve
our nation's history and drive economic growth in the Hudson River
Valley.
The Town of Saratoga is committed to initiatives that enhance our
economic, historical, and environmental well-being. Inclusion in the
Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area would
significantly bolster our efforts to preserve our rich heritage while
fostering sustainable development and tourism. This opportunity is
particularly timely as we approach our celebration of the 250th
anniversary of the American Revolution in 2027, which will commemorate
pivotal events such as the Battles of Saratoga. These battles played a
crucial role in shaping our nation's history and continue to be a
source of pride and education for our community.
The Saratoga Campaign of 1777 was pivotal in the American
Revolutionary War. British General John Burgoyne led an army to seize
control of the strategically crucial Hudson River Valley. However, his
campaign culminated in defeat at the Battles of Saratoga, forcing his
surrender to American General Horatio Gates on October 17, 1777. This
unprecedented event--the first surrender of an entire British army in
history--had far-reaching consequences. It enabled Benjamin Franklin to
secure vital foreign assistance for the American cause, transforming
the conflict into a global war spanning North America, the Caribbean,
Africa, Asia, and Europe. The Battles of Saratoga were monumentally
significant because they breathed life into the ideals set forth in the
Declaration of Independence. Until this point, these principles of
freedom and self-governance were merely words on paper. The American
victory at Saratoga demonstrated the viability of these ideals, not
just for our fledgling nation but for all of humanity. It proved that
the concepts of liberty and independence could triumph against
seemingly insurmountable odds, setting a powerful precedent for future
generations.
The Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area was established 28
years ago, encompassing 10 counties and the village of Waterford in
Saratoga County. Its primary purpose was to commemorate the American
Revolution and highlight our nation's ongoing commitment to the
fundamental human rights of liberty, equality, and dignity. However,
the heritage area's boundaries were initially determined based on
Congressional districts rather than on communities recognized for their
historical significance in the Hudson Valley. Over time, the heritage
area has evolved administratively, incorporating Saratoga National
Historical Park--which Saratoga County proposes renaming to Saratoga
National Battlefield Park. It's crucial to note that while the National
Park was added, the surrounding communities that also witnessed actual
combat and the British surrender were not included.
We deeply value Saratoga National Historical Park, its dedicated
staff, its stunning landscape, exceptional preservation efforts, and
outstanding interpretive programs. However, we recognize that the park
is distinct from the communities where part of the Battles of Saratoga
actually unfolded. Our towns and villages in Saratoga and Washington
counties, each with their unique heritage and historical significance,
bear the responsibility of preserving this vital part of American
history. Unlike the National Park Service, our communities lack
substantial resources to fulfill this important duty effectively.
The proposed Enhancement Act would expand the Heritage Area to
include all locations where fighting occurred, where patriots made the
ultimate sacrifice, and where American independence was secured. This
region is of international importance, and our communities require your
support to continue this critical conservation work and develop
economic independence. By including these areas, we can ensure a more
comprehensive preservation and interpretation of the events that shaped
our nation's history.
The proposed addition of Saratoga and Washington Counties to the
Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area through H.R. 390 is crucial
for preserving and promoting our region's rich history. This inclusion
aligns perfectly with the goals of the Saratoga County 250th
Commission, established by the Saratoga County Board of Supervisors to
educate the public about the Battles of Saratoga, increase heritage
tourism, and enhance infrastructure at historic sites.
The 250th anniversary commemorations of the Battles of Saratoga
will be landmark events featuring gatherings of patriotic
organizations, parades, reenactments, fireworks, and scholarly
symposiums. Inclusion in the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area
would significantly enhance these efforts by providing additional
resources, expertise, and national recognition. This designation would
improve coordination with other Revolutionary War sites along the
Hudson, facilitate access to federal funding, and expand commemorative
events.
The goals of the County's 250th Commission complement those of the
Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area.
Inclusion in the Heritage Area will increase visibility for historic
sites, potentially leading to higher visitation and improved
preservation efforts. It will also foster collaboration with other
sites in the heritage area, enhancing the coordinated 250th-anniversary
celebrations along the Hudson River.
Our communities stand to benefit economically from increased
heritage tourism. For instance, Schuylerville is transitioning from an
aged mill community to a heritage tourism center. The Heritage Area can
bring resources to assist this transformation by improving
infrastructure and supporting preservation efforts. Additionally, it
can provide expertise in creating enhanced educational resources for
local schools and communities.
The economic impact of National Heritage Areas is significant. A
2018 report to Congress stated that these areas leveraged $5.50 for
every $1 of federal funding received and created approximately 920,000
jobs nationally. By joining the Hudson River Valley National Heritage
Area, Saratoga and Washington Counties can tap into these benefits,
fostering economic growth and preserving our historical legacy for
future generations.
For more information about the Saratoga County 250th Commission and
its initiatives, please visit Saratoga250.com.
National Heritage Areas have generally been considered successful
across the United States, and the Hudson Valley National Heritage Area
has had specific successes. Studies have shown that national heritage
areas contribute significantly to local economies. A 2012 study found
that they contribute $12.9 billion annually to the national economy by
supporting job creation, particularly in the tourism and preservation
sectors. The Hudson Valley National Heritage Area has supported the
preservation and interpretation of numerous historic sites, including
those related to the American Revolution. In addition, the Hudson
Valley National Heritage Area has supported efforts to preserve and
celebrate the diverse cultural heritage of the Hudson Valley, including
Native American, Dutch, and African American histories, which are also
important themes of the American Revolution. Most importantly, the
Hudson Valley National Heritage Area has helped to strengthen regional
identity and pride in the Hudson Valley's heritage. The Hudson River
Valley is the identity of our communities. The Hudson River defines our
community.
In conclusion, adding three simple words to existing legislation
will empower and facilitate our communities' better collaboration with
federal and state agencies to achieve our common goals. By supporting
H.R. 390, you will not throw away your shot to correct a historical
oversight, thus boosting local economies and ensuring that future
generations can fully appreciate the birthplace of American
independence. I invite you to visit Saratoga County and witness our
heritage's significance and preparations for the 250th Commemoration of
the Battles of Saratoga.
Thank you for considering my testimony. For more information,

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Mr. Kelleher. I now recognize
Members for 5 minutes for questions.
The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Franklin, you are up for 5
minutes, if you choose.
Mr. Franklin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Ms. Beasley, I appreciate you being here today to respond
on these, has Congress ever granted the Park Service Authority
to manage areas of Big Cypress National Preserve as wilderness?
Ms. Beasley. No, sir. Only Congress has the authority to
designate wilderness.
Mr. Franklin. So, when Big Cypress was first created, it
was specifically going to be a preserve, and not used as
wilderness. So, it was commentary at the time that the Park
Service was planning to do a subsequent study at some point in
the future to look at the feasibility of designating some of
those lands as wilderness, and I think it was 2022 the study
was released, and it listed three options in there. The third
option, the Alternative 3, would propose that Congress
designate approximately 147,910 acres of land, which was 25
percent of the original preserve, as wilderness.
Has the Park Service ever come forth to Congress to submit
that proposal, and request that it be redesignated as
wilderness?
Ms. Beasley. No, there is not a proposal currently for
designation as wilderness.
Mr. Franklin. OK. Would you agree that the Park Service is
currently managing that land, the 147,910 acres, as wilderness?
Ms. Beasley. Well, the Wilderness Act directs Federal
agencies to study their lands for potential inclusion in the
National Wilderness Preservation System, so we seek to follow
that mandate. The National Park Service's management policies
direct us to manage areas that are found eligible or are
proposed for wilderness to be managed as wilderness.
Mr. Franklin. As the Park Service has determined eligible,
or as Congress has approved?
Ms. Beasley. Based on the findings of a wilderness study,
as directed by the Wilderness Act.
Mr. Franklin. OK, so the Park Service will conduct its
study, make its determination, but without them getting
subsequent approval from Congress, will just go forth and carry
that out as though it had Congress' permission.
Ms. Beasley. Well, again, the Wilderness Act directs
Federal agencies to study their lands for potential inclusion
in the National Wilderness Preservation System. The National
Park Service seeks to preserve wilderness qualities in order to
allow for a future potential designation, should Congress
choose to make a formal designation.
Mr. Franklin. I understand and appreciate that. But you do
appreciate, though, that that final authority should rest with
Congress. Do you agree with that?
Ms. Beasley. Yes, sir. Only Congress has the authority to
designate wilderness.
Mr. Franklin. Thank you. And in fairness, from the
conversations we have had, the relationship currently is very
amicable, but there is concern about the future, what that
could evolve to, eventually, and particularly in the absence of
any official designation by Congress.
Chairman Cypress, I would like to hear your thoughts, your
concerns about the future of what this could hold for these
tribal lands. And then also, could you comment on other areas
of tribal lands around the country where this maybe has not
worked out so well for the tribes?
Mr. Cypress. Yes. We have had a more amicable relationship
with the National Park Service of late, but this designation,
we believe, is the wrong answer to some of these issues that
are being brought up, and the Tribe is willing to co-manage
with the Park Service, and use our resources to help out. And
we have had discussions, internal discussions. But this
designation seems to be one of the major pushes that they are
making.
And in the written testimony we have examples of certain
areas that have been designated wilderness, like I think with
the Chippewas, and they lost access to their lands. So, we
don't want to end up in that same situation. We have been given
assurances by the National Park, but assurances don't coincide
with the language in the Wilderness Act.
Mr. Franklin. Thank you, Chairman Cypress.
And Mr. Chairman, I would urge the Committee's strong
consideration of support for this bill. There is a time and a
place for wilderness areas, but it needs to be done properly
and in accordance with the way Congress has set this process
out. And in this case, we feel that that has not been followed,
the will of Congress has been thwarted, and I would urge our
colleagues' adoption of my bill.
Mr. Tiffany. So, is it correct, Mr. Franklin, that you or
no Member of Florida has introduced a bill to take some of
these lands that are in question and put them into wilderness?
Mr. Franklin. No. In fact, this bill would specifically
prevent this.
Mr. Tiffany. But no one from Florida has introduced a bill
to move this into wilderness?
Mr. Franklin. No, and quite the contrary, this is very
bipartisan with our delegation.
Mr. Tiffany. Thank you for your questioning.
Mr. Franklin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Tiffany. I am going to take a few minutes here for
questioning also.
Ms. Beasley, management plans for the National Heritage
Areas involve partnerships between the National Park Service
and state or local groups. While these designations can be used
for tourism purposes, there are also concerns about if it
infringes on private property rights. What assurances does the
Park Service have that National Heritage Area designations or
expansions will not restrict any type of private development or
private property rights?
Ms. Beasley. Thank you for your question, sir. This is an
important point, and an important distinction to make.
Designation as a National Heritage Area does not confer any
ownership or other authority to the Federal Government to
restrict what private property owners may or may not do with
their property. It does not require private property owners to
participate in national heritage activities, or to allow, for
example, public access to their land. And most authorizing
legislation for National Heritage Areas includes specific
provisions for the protection of private property rights.
And I will also note that the National Heritage Area System
Act also contains specific and stringent provisions protecting
the rights of private property owners.
Mr. Tiffany. And there are no buffers or boundaries that
are set up under a National Heritage Area that could infringe
on someone's property, restricting their ability to be able to
use that property?
Ms. Beasley. No, sir. Again, designation as a heritage area
does not put any restrictions on private property owners. It
does not create specific requirements for private property
owners that are within the National Heritage Area.
Mr. Tiffany. Thank you.
Chairman Cypress, in your testimony you stated that Natives
still living on traditional lands have been removed, harassed,
and convicted of crimes related to their traditional practices
under the Wilderness Act. Can you expand on this concern, and
highlight a few issues that may surprise people who generally
support the idea of conservation, but might not understand some
of the unanticipated consequences of wilderness designations?
Mr. Cypress. Yes, I don't have the specific incidents where
it has happened. It is in my written testimony that I have
submitted to the Committee. But I know, for us, the Tribe, we
have had the experience of the Everglades National Park being
established, and stripping away thousands of acres from the
Miccosukee Tribe when that happened. So, that is just one
instance of where the Park Service has done an action that they
don't listen to the tribes when they move forward with some of
these issues.
Mr. Tiffany. Does it surprise you, or have you heard that
we have seen that the Biden administration, via I believe it
was the Bureau of Land Management, did not fully take into
account consultation with tribes up on the North Slope of
Alaska? First of all, have you heard about that?
Mr. Cypress. No, not----
Mr. Tiffany. Does it surprise you that the Federal
Government has not taken into account their concerns, that they
did not go through the official consultation process?
Mr. Cypress. Yes, that is surprising. They have been very
good about meeting and consulting with us, but I don't believe
we are being listened to on some of these issues. I think true
consultation means taking our advice that we give, and using
that when they propose these different ideas.
Mr. Tiffany. As the Chairman of Federal Lands, it has been
very surprising to me when we hear an administration that talks
all the time about, boy, we consult, we coordinate, and we work
with the tribes, we always consider them pre-eminently in our
discussions when we make decisions, and to see issues like this
that fly in the face of those words, that they are actually not
consulting with the tribes.
Ms. Andrews, it is good to have you back here before the
Committee. And your office recently sent a letter with more
than 250 organizations calling for the Senate to pass the
EXPLORE Act.
Can you explain why it is so important for the Senate to
take up and pass the EXPLORE Act? Give us a couple of examples
of why you think it is really important for this to move to the
President's desk.
Ms. Andrews. Yes. Thank you for the question, and first I
would like to congratulate you all on moving that through the
House. That has been years in the making by hundreds and
hundreds of people working on that bill. So, the momentum right
now that we have is critical to be able to get that and move
that through the Senate.
For us and in the Office of Outdoor Recreation, the access
to public lands is critical. The growth of the outdoor economy,
public health and wellness, all of the benefits related to
economic development, we see that when outdoor recreation
access is achieved. And by passing the EXPLORE Act through the
Senate, that will ensure that for future generations all of
this will come to pass. So, I look forward to seeing that pass
through the Senate very soon.
Mr. Tiffany. Well, it is certainly a consistent message in
regards to access. We have been hearing it across the country,
people looking for access to our Federal lands and also not
denying access, as we are hearing today in testimony.
Mr. Lemoine, in your role as Executive Director, how do you
partner with local outfitters to promote partnerships that
provide jobs and opportunities?
Mr. Lemoine. Thank you for your question. We partner with a
number of different community groups, recreation groups, and
fresh water districts on a number of different waterways
throughout the heritage area not only to help develop strategic
plans for action for their waterways, for restoration, for
recreation enhancements, but we also do a lot of work in
partnership building within those different parishes and within
the different state agencies to sort of help make sure that the
people in our smaller communities have access to the technical
and financial resources that are available to them both on the
state and Federal level.
Our work often acts as the go-between to make sure that the
people in our smaller communities, who don't often get access
to the technical knowledge, are given those connections.
Mr. Tiffany. Yes. Another really consistent message we have
heard throughout this Committee is local communities,
oftentimes small communities that are near these areas, that
they get the opportunity to thrive also.
Mr. Kelleher, I really appreciate your testimony. I love
hearing about Burgoyne and the Redcoats and Saratoga, and all
the rest here, taking us in the way-back machine to the history
books, back in grade school. And tell us how Representative
Stefanik's legislation will help the Town of Saratoga as you
prepare for the 250th anniversary just a couple years down the
road.
Mr. Kelleher. Thank you, Chairman, for the question.
It is really an opportunity to help our collaboration up
and down the Hudson River. When you look at communities
planning for the 250th anniversary, the strongest ones in our
area are Westchester County and Saratoga County.
Geographically, we are pretty distant. But what we have in
common is we have the Hudson River. It is what defines our part
of the state, it defines our area. And that is what this
heritage area does.
And we are able to use these strengths through the heritage
area, whether it be Westchester County or Saratoga County, we
are able to bring along some of the other counties that may not
have as much strength. So, we can kind of rise that boat in the
Hudson River all together by working through this partnership
which gets facilitated by the National Park Service.
Mr. Tiffany. We look forward to visiting in 2026.
Mr. Kelleher. Thank you. We look forward to having you.
Mr. Tiffany. Yes, I want to thank the witnesses here today.
Lots of stuff going on here, a little delay, and I appreciate
your patience. Most of all, I appreciate you taking the time to
come here, oftentimes from far distances. We appreciate that
more than you know.
Members of the Subcommittee may have some additional
questions for our witnesses today. If they do, we will ask that
the witnesses respond to those in writing.
Under Committee Rule 3, members of the Subcommittee must
submit questions to the Subcommittee Clerk by 5 p.m. on
Tuesday, July 2, 2024. Getting close to the Fourth of July,
aren't we? The hearing record will be held open for 10 business
days for those responses.
And if there is no further business, without objection, the
Subcommittee on Federal Lands stands adjourned.

[Whereupon, at 1:10 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

[ADDITIONAL MATERIALS SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD]

Statement for the Record
U.S. Forest Service
U.S. Department of Agriculture
on H.R. 3971--Flatside Wilderness Additions Act

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and Members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for inviting the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's (USDA) Forest Service, to discuss H.R. 3971, the
``Flatside Wilderness Additions Act.''

H.R. 3971 amends the Arkansas Wilderness Act of 1984, adding 2,215
acres in the Ouachita National Forest as wilderness under the National
Wilderness Preservation System. This parcel would be an addition to the
existing Flatside Wilderness. The bill also renames the newly expanded
Flatside Wilderness, including the 2019 addition, as the ``Flatside-
Bethune Wilderness.''

USDA recognizes the importance of wilderness areas, and the Forest
Service embraces its mission to steward and safeguard wilderness
character in Congressionally designated wilderness. USDA supports H.R.
3971 and would like to work with the Subcommittee and the sponsor of
this bill to address some technical concerns.

The Forest Service would like to draw attention to the 720 acres of
non-federal mineral rights underlying the proposed wilderness, all
believed to be in private ownership. The proposed wilderness would be
subject to pre-existing mineral rights and potential development even
if Congress were to designate these additional parcels as wilderness.
We are currently exploring options for consolidating these mineral
rights into federal ownership and would like to work with the
Subcommittee as we explore options.

The legislation as written establishes a 60-foot setback for Forest
Service Road 793. The Forest Service recommends changing this setback
to 66 feet, which would make the proposed wilderness addition
consistent with the current Flatside Wilderness boundary legal
description.

Renaming all portions of the wilderness, including the existing
Flatside Wilderness, the 2019 addition, and the current proposed
addition to ``Flatside-Bethune Wilderness'' will allow the Forest
Service to maintain consistency in signage and minimize confusion. The
Forest Service supports this consistent naming convention.

Thank you for the opportunity to testify on H.R. 3971. I welcome
any questions from the Subcommittee.

Submissions for the Record by Rep. Neguse

Prepared Statement of the Hon. Joe Neguse, a Representative in Congress
from the State of Colorado

Thank you, Chairman Tiffany.

Good morning, everyone. It's been another busy week for the Federal
Lands Subcommittee, with a legislative hearing on six bills today.

From historic sites associated with the War 1812 to studying new
heritage areas in Maui and designating new wilderness in Chair
Westerman's home state of Arkansas, I'm sure we'll cover a lot of
ground today.

The bills on today's docket serve as a reminder of the wide range
of benefits and uses associated with our parks and public lands--they
protect natural ecosystems, safeguard our cherished cultural heritage,
and provide the backdrop for a wide range of outdoor recreational
activities.

So, it is imperative that we continue to identify new places worthy
of conservation and we fight to secure sufficient resources so that
federal land managers have the resources they need to steward and
protect them for present and future generations to come.

As members of the Federal Lands Subcommittee, we collectively have
the opportunity to champion new conservation opportunities--something I
was proud to lead when I served as Chair of this Subcommittee, and
continue to advocate for today.

Despite the debate and disagreements we often engage in regarding
the management of our public lands, it is clear that we need to do more
to protect the health of our public lands.

As made clear by today's hearing, there are still plenty of places
throughout the country that deserve increased protection and
conservation, and I'm eager to learn more about each of these bills.

Importantly, this is one of the first hearings we have held in the
entire 118th Congress that features conservation designations.

This is a great first start, and I thank the Chairman for including
these measures in today's hearing. But I would also like to remind my
friends across the aisle that there is a long running list of
additional bills--sponsored by members of both parties--to create new
national parks, designate new wilderness and withdrawals, and protect
some of the most special places across our great nation.

This includes my CORE Act, which I've talked about many times in
this Subcommittee, and so many more. Our constituents support real
conservation, enhanced recreational opportunities, and even ways to
accelerate tribal co-stewardship and enhance protections for sacred
sites.

But first, let's turn to today's agenda.

H.R. 309 and H.R. 6843 expand the boundaries of existing National
Heritage Areas, while H.R. 8219 will direct the Secretary of the
Interior to conduct a study to determine the suitability and
feasibility of designating Lahaina as a National Heritage Area.

Driven by grassroots initiatives, National Heritage Areas preserve
areas of significant importance to communities through natural,
cultural, and historic resources. These sites also serve the community
by providing recreational and economic opportunities. I'm particularly
glad to see H.R. 8219 from my friend Rep. Tokuda on today's agenda, as
I am a proud original cosponsor of the bill.

Then we have H.R. 6826 to redesignate the visitor and educational
center at Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine in honor
of Paul S. Sarbanes, who was instrumental in ensuring the preservation
of the vaunted site. This is a fitting tribute.

Finally, turning to the other key topic on today's agenda:
wilderness.

Enacted in 1964, the Wilderness Act established the National
Wilderness Preservation System to protect the natural environment,
which today stands at approximately 111 million acres of protected
land.

Only Congress can designate new wilderness, and while many have
supported these designations throughout the country over the years, as
is the case with H.R. 3971, which would expand the Flatside Wilderness
Area in Arkansas, new designation also come with concerns regarding
limitations on access for historical and traditional uses.

H.R. 8206 serves as an example of these potential concerns and
conflicts. This legislation would prohibit any future wilderness
designations within the boundaries of the Big Cypress National Preserve
in Florida.

My understanding is that this bill was developed as a response to
the National Park Service draft Backcountry Access Plan for future
management in this area.

In particular, the Miccosukee Tribe has expressed specific concerns
about their traditional access and use of Big Cypress.

I look forward to hearing directly from Chairman Talbert Cypress
and hope that we can identify a solution that allows the planning
process to proceed.

With that, I yield back.

[all]
