3(o).
Without objection, so ordered.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. PAUL GOSAR, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA

Dr. Gosar. I want to thank everyone for joining us today
for this critically important hearing, especially the witnesses
who have taken time out of their day and their jobs just to be
here.
Speaking of showing up for your job today, I would like to
point out that we are missing a government witness today, CEQ
Chairman Brenda Mallory, who declined to attend today's
hearing, citing official business travel, appears to be working
from Hawaii on a taxpayer-funded junket. While I agree that
soaking up the sun and making grant announcements in Hawaii
sounds nicer than answering to Congress, sometimes you just
need to face the music.
Today, we are here to discuss the themes of the executive
branch, specifically with the current Administration, and what
can happen when that branch of government expands its power
beyond the scope of its original intent.
America's founders were gravely aware of the dangers of
concentrated power, and intentionally designed a system of
separating government powers into the legislative, executive,
and judicial. In the 20th century, as our nation grew, the
size, scope, and the intrusion of the government activity
increased exponentially. Today, the size and the breadth of the
Federal Government would be unrecognizable to our nation's
founders. The growth of the executive branch in both size and
power has far outpaced the growth of other branches, and has
resulted in more concentrated power and less accountability to
the public.
The Biden administration has continued on a relentless
march towards expansion, particularly by trying to reimagine
the energy sector as a puppet of environmental activism.
Instead of attempting to work with Congress and pass
legislation, President Biden has ruled by fiat, abusing
executive orders to radically restrict America's energy
independence. These actions include canceling the construction
of an energy pipeline and halting leasing on large swaths of
Federal lands for oil and gas production on his first day in
office; issuing an executive order that utilized the executive
branch as forces for social and cultural movements for the
left, rather than good governance; and issuing executive orders
that inject principles of environmental justice into nearly all
Federal actions.
Time and time again, we have seen President Biden abuse
executive authority to promote his radical eco-agenda created
by academics and social activists, regardless of the reality on
the ground for the American public. The results of President
Biden's radical eco-agenda have been catastrophic. We have seen
the highest inflation in 40 years, crushing energy prices for
American consumers and increased reliance on our foreign
adversaries, notably China.
I am certain that my friends on the other side of the aisle
will extoll the virtues of these executive orders today, in
particular as it relates to climate change and environmental
justice. But I ask you: at what cost? The left's race to
achieve a clean energy standard is simply unsustainable, at
least on the timeline that the Biden administration has set
forth. Experts say a quantum leap in science and technology
would be necessary to replace carbon-based energy sources on
the timeline proposed by the Biden administration. I again ask
you: at what cost?
In the United States, we utilize the best available
practices, standards, and science in terms of extraction,
manufacturing, and labor. The same cannot be said for our
counterparts in China, Russia, Venezuela, and the African
nations. We have lower greenhouse emissions, stringent labor
laws, yet continually seek to move the goal posts, which
results in nothing more than outsourcing our resources needs to
countries that routinely violate human rights laws. The last
time I checked, benevolent dictators don't really care about
permits or anything closely resembling NEPA.
And what happens at home, the end result of all this
nonsense? In my district, I can tell you. Some of the most
vulnerable, those who identify as environmental justice
communities, are still not being heard by this Administration.
They are paying more for the few services they do have, and
losing out on opportunities for new income streams, like fully
utilizing oil and gas allotments on their homelands.
Today, we take the first step at exposing the radical
executive overreach of President Biden as we work to reverse
course and inject a dose of restraint and reason into America's
energy policies. And perhaps most important of all, restore the
balance of powers between the executive and legislative
branches.
With that, I turn and recognize Ranking Member Stansbury,
my neighbor from the Southwest and neighboring New Mexico, for
any statement she may have.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. MELANIE A. STANSBURY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO

Ms. Stansbury. Good afternoon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and
thank you to all of our witnesses for being here today.
I do want to just take a moment before I make a few
statements about the content of today's hearing just to note
that, while we are aware that the Administration is unable to
join us today, we also want to be clear that the reason why
they are unable to join us is there was not sufficient notice
given in order for them to be here. So, we look forward to
working with the Majority in order to make sure that they can
attend a future hearing.
We are going to hear a lot today about domestic energy
production. We are going to hear a lot today about permitting,
about climate change, and about environmental justice. Why are
these topics so important, and why do we continue to have
hearings about these?
First and foremost, as we all know, the science is telling
us and the latest report from the IPCC has indicated that if we
do not take climate action now, our planet is facing a major
nexus in terms of potential planetary disaster. And that is why
we in the Majority, the Democrats during the last Congress,
passed the most significant infrastructure and climate action
bills ever in the history of the United States, including the
Inflation Reduction Act, which is really aimed at reducing
climate emissions by 40 percent by 2030.
But let's talk a little bit about domestic energy
production. It is important to understand that over the last 20
years, the United States has actually become the second
largest, not only consumer of energy in the world, but the
second largest producer of energy in the world. In fact, we
have the second highest crude oil production in America ever,
and the highest natural gas production ever. And in my home
state of New Mexico, in the Permian Basin, we are seeing the
highest production ever in the history of our state.
So, the oil and gas industry is not struggling in the
United States, and certainly that is not what is driving prices
at the pump, as our colleagues across the aisle would like to
have us believe. We are, in fact, coming out of a major global
pandemic in which our communities, like probably everyone who
is sitting here in this hearing room, spent at least a year, if
not more, inside our homes. We were not driving, we were not
consuming petroleum products on the level we had historically.
And as a result, oil and gas production actually reduced, due
to the lack of demand. And also, that affected the price of oil
and gas. We then saw, of course, last year Russia invaded
Ukraine. That caused another spike in global oil and gas
prices. And then there was an effort by OPEC+ and Russia to
restrain oil production globally. All of these global forces
have affected the global supply and demand of oil and gas,
which drives the prices at the pump.
Our President, this Administration, and the Congress that
is sitting before you have done everything we can within our
toolbox to try to address these issues so that we can lower
prices at the pump for Americans. But at the end of the day,
much of this is outside of the power of the individuals who are
sitting on this dais or are sitting at the other end of
Pennsylvania Avenue.
I think it is crucial as part of this conversation to
acknowledge we are going to hear a lot today, probably, about
permitting and leasing, that because of the limitations on our
ability to affect global oil and gas prices, the argument that,
ultimately, at the end of the day, what is constraining prices
at the pump is leasing on public lands is just factually
untrue. Really, at the end of the day, what it is about and
what is driving that argument is the desire by the oil and gas
industry to make future oil and gas leases in order to keep
their business plans afloat, especially as there has been
consolidation in the industry and over-capitalization. It is
not a permitting problem. It is not a leasing problem. So, it
is crucial that we stay focused on the facts.
Now, the reason why the Administration has advanced
multiple efforts in this Congress, this past Congress under
Democratic leadership has advanced environmental justice
initiatives is because our communities for far too long have
borne the brunt of development of our oil and gas and other
natural resources without seeing the benefits of those. So, it
is crucial that we ensure, as we are investing in a more
sustainable transition, a more climate-just future that our
communities have the opportunity to get access to those
resources, that they are able to plan for their own future, and
to determine what they would like to see as their own economic
future for their communities.
I want to thank our witnesses once again for being here. We
are fortunate to be joined by one of our nation's foremost
experts on NEPA, which is one of the environmental policy bills
that we are going to discuss today.
And I just want to end by saying that we know that we have
to take climate action now, and it is our job to ensure that we
create a more sustainable, a more just, and a more equitable
future for our communities.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.

Dr. Gosar. I thank the gentlelady from New Mexico. I have
to correct the lady from New Mexico. We did give 2 weeks'
notice as required. They just said that she had travel plans.
So, they are not entitled to their facts; those are the facts.
She was given ample time.
I now want to turn to the Full Committee Chair, Mr.
Westerman, for his opening statement.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS

Mr. Westerman. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you to
Subcommittee Chairman Gosar for holding this important hearing
today, as well as the witnesses and Members for their time and
for showing up.
And speaking of showing up, we have a key witness who
declined to attend today. And again, that is Brenda Mallory,
the Chair of the Council of Environmental Quality. And this is
not the first time we have had issues with attendance from CEQ,
although her office did note she looks forward to showing up
soon. But I am not holding my breath. Apparently, she is
tweeting from Hawaii today instead of being here with us. And
all I can say is we are working closely with the Appropriations
Committee and looking at their budget every chance we get. I am
sure Hawaii is fun, but it is not a valid reason to skip coming
here and taking care of the people's business.
Decisions made by CEQ have real impacts on American
families, and it is time to face those facts. As of this
morning, the average price of gasoline was $3.53 a gallon. That
is nearly a full dollar higher than when President Trump left
office. If last summer is any indication, this number will
skyrocket right as families begin to head out on road trips.
And speaking of road trips, the price of a new car is a
whopping $48,000, and even used car prices average around
$26,500. And I would like to note for the record that the
average cost of a new vehicle right now is higher than the
median household income in my hometown of Hot Springs,
Arkansas.
So, why is this relevant to our discussion? The Biden
administration continues repeating the same talking points
about the need to invest in infrastructure, underserved
communities, and social and environmental justice. Time and
again, these lofty words result in more red tape, bigger
bureaucracies, and higher prices for American families. It is
all talk with not any action in the right direction.
Look no further than the dramatic growth of the Council on
Environmental Quality, commonly known as CEQ, in both size and
mission creep. From 2019 to 2023, CEQ's baseline budget
increased by 63 percent, in addition to receiving a massive
cash infusion from the Inflation Reduction Act to further
inject radical environmental justice initiatives in the
government. Those taxpayer dollars still haven't been spent,
yet President Biden's latest budget request calls for even more
money to CEQ.
Despite this Administration's best efforts, we can never
spend our way out of the problems that America is facing. We
need proactive, long-term solutions to get our economy back on
track, to shore up our national security, and hold Federal
agencies accountable. House Republicans have already advanced
many of those solutions this Congress, and we remain committed
to turning over every stone and ensuring taxpayer dollars
aren't going to waste here in DC.
CEQ and our current permitting processes, primarily through
NEPA, blanket the American energy sector in red tape. And I
said the American energy sector, not just oil and gas, but the
entire sector. It is keeping shovel-ready projects and good-
paying jobs on the back burner, while bureaucrats twiddle their
thumbs. Just last week, the editorial board of The New York
Times, that is New York Times, not Wall Street Journal,
described the red tape for energy transmission projects as ``a
jumble of approval processes'' that ``causes environmental
damage.'' Given the length of time it takes to get new projects
reviewed and approved to fix the mess, the Times editors called
for decisive action to reform ``unnecessarily cumbersome
regulations,'' including NEPA.
I couldn't agree more. Our own regulations are killing us.
I have often used the illustration of Aesop's fable of the
eagle that was flying high overhead, and he was struck by an
arrow, and as he fluttered to the ground with his lifeblood
pouring out, he looked back at the arrow and said, ``Alas, I
have been mortally wounded by an arrow that is feathered with
my own plume.'' That is what we are doing to ourselves in this
country. We are killing our country with our own means, and I
can't figure out for the life of me for what reason, because it
is not doing anything to help the environment. It is certainly
not helping the economy. And I don't understand the purpose or
the reason behind these actions.
And that is why we passed H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs
Act, and that is why we have continued advancing solutions to
get our country back on track. Our businesses, families, our
communities, and America deserve better, and that is what we
are going to continue working to make sure that this country
stays strong, that this country continues to lead the world in
environmental stewardship, in human rights, and that we can
lead the world in energy and manufacturing, and be an example
instead of being a donor to countries like China and to OPEC
that our current policies are making us dependent on.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

Dr. Gosar. I thank the Chairman for his opening statement,
and now I am going to introduce our witnesses.
First, we have Ms. Diana Furchtgott-Roth. Did I say that
right?
Ms. Furchtgott-Roth. Yes.
Dr. Gosar. Bingo. Director, Center of Energy, Climate, and
Environmental Policy, The Heritage Foundation.
A personal friend of mine, Mr. Jeremy Harrell, Chief
Strategy Officer from ClearPath.
Good to see you, Jeremy.
Ms. Jamie Pleune, Associate Professor, S.J. Quinney College
of Law, University of Utah.
Thank you.
And Mr. Kenny Stein, Director of Policy, Institute for
Energy Research.
Let me remind the witnesses that under Committee Rules,
they must limit their oral statements to 5 minutes, but their
entire statement will appear in the hearing record.
To begin your testimony, please push the ``on'' button so
we can hear you.
We use timing lights. When the light turns green, you have
5 minutes. When it turns yellow, you have 1 minute. And when it
turns red, please summarize and try to complete your statement.
I will also allow all witnesses to testify before Members'
questioning.
I now recognize Ms. Furchtgott-Roth for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF DIANA FURCHTGOTT-ROTH, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR
ENERGY, CLIMATE, AND THE HERBERT AND JOYCE MORGAN FELLOW IN
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION, CHEVY
CHASE, MARYLAND

Ms. Furchtgott-Roth. Thank you very much. Chairman
Westerman, Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member Stansbury, and
members of the Subcommittee, I am honored to be invited to
testify before you today.
Creeping executive overreach not envisaged by Congress in
the original messages or purposes of cabinet agencies is
driving up the price of energy and energy-related products.
This is raising automotive and electricity costs for all
Americans, and poor and middle-class Americans are
disproportionately paying the price. This is not environmental
justice or any kind of justice to have to pay higher prices for
necessities such as electricity, gasoline, and cars. Led by the
White House, mission creep can be found at many agencies,
including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Council on
Environmental Quality, the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
President Biden's higher prices for electricity and
transportation bring no climate benefits. Even completely
eliminating all fossil fuels from the United States would
result in less than \2/10\ of 1 degree Celsius in temperature
mitigation by the year 2100, according to research using EPA's
own climate models. So, these higher prices are all for
nothing.
EPA's attempt to regulate regional emissions through a
novel attempt of the Clean Air Act, known as the Clean Power
Plan, was deemed executive overreach by the Supreme Court in
West Virginia v. EPA. Creeping executive branch oversight of
energy started on the first day in office, when President Biden
revoked the permit for Keystone XL pipeline. In August 2021,
the President issued an executive order that, by 2030, half of
new vehicles sold in the United States must be electric,
including fuel cell electric plug-in hybrids and full battery
electric.
Last month, EPA proposed costly regulations on automobile
emissions that would require new car sales to be 60 percent
battery powered electric by 2030 and 67 percent by 2023,
compared to fewer than 6 percent in 2022. This will make cars
more expensive, less safe, and cost American auto workers jobs.
United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain came out on April 26
saying, ``Shame on Congress for doing this, shame on the
President for doing this,'' because it is costing his workers
jobs. Stellantis is laying off 3,500 people. They closed a
plant in Illinois in December.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which
regulates banks, has appointed a Chief Climate Risk Officer to
assess and monitor climate-driven risks to banks. This is going
to discourage investment in fossil fuels, and will allow the
investigations of companies and banks that OCC believes are
making the wrong investment.
The Council on Environmental Quality issued new guidance on
January 9, 2023 requiring Federal agencies to use the NEPA
process to reduce emissions from greenhouse gases. That means
that projects that result in higher greenhouse gas emissions
will find it harder to get NEPA approval. The guidance takes
effect immediately, without even waiting for CEQ to address
comments from the public and regulated industries. Some
agencies are including in their compliance with NEPA factors,
factors that Congress did not originally intend. This is an
example of harmful arbitrary and capricious policy.
The Securities and Exchange Commission also wants to stick
its fingers into energy production. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler
has proposed rules to require companies to disclose information
about government and management of climate risks, making it
more difficult to get approval for fossil fuel investments.
Meanwhile, China is increasing its construction of coal-fired
power plants. America has 225 and China has 1,118. China has
increased carbon emissions by over 5,000 million metric tons
over the past 16 years; the United States has reduced it by
about 1,000 million metric tons.
Americans, particularly the poor and middle class, are
bearing the costs in higher electricity prices, higher food
prices, and a forced switch to electric vehicles without
benefits for the environment. This is not environmental
justice, social justice, or any kind of justice.
Thank you very much.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Furchtgott-Roth follows:]
Prepared Statement of Diana Furchtgott-Roth, Director, Center on
Energy, Climate, and Environment and The Herbert and Joyce Morgan
Fellow
in Energy and Environmental Policy, The Heritage Foundation
My name is Diana Furchtgott-Roth. I am the director of the Center
for Energy, Climate, and Environment at The Heritage Foundation. The
views I express in this testimony are my own and should not be
construed as representing any official position of The Heritage
Foundation.
Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member Stansbury, Members of the
Subcommittee, I am honored to be invited to testify before you today on
the subject of, ``The Biden Administration's Executive Overreach and
Its Effect on American Energy Independence.''
In addition to my role at The Heritage Foundation, I am also an
adjunct professor of economics at George Washington University. My
professional training is in economics. From 2019 to 2021, I was deputy
assistant secretary for research and technology at the U.S. Department
of Transportation. Previous positions include acting assistant
secretary for economic policy at the U.S. Department of the Treasury;
chief economist at the U.S. Department of Labor; chief of staff of the
Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush; and deputy
executive secretary of the Domestic Policy Council under President
George H.W. Bush.
In the last State of the Union, President Biden said, ``The climate
crisis doesn't care if your state is red or blue. It [the climate
crisis] is an existential threat.'' \1\ The President has used the so-
called existential climate crisis to expand dramatically the power of
different executive branch agencies with the object of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ President Joe Biden, State of the Union Address, February 7,
2023, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/
02/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-
prepared-for-delivery/ (accessed May 8, 2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This creeping overreach, not envisaged by Congress in the original
missions or purposes of these agencies, has driven up the price of
energy and energy-related products. A runaway government is trying to
control our lives for no apparent benefit, but guaranteeing
impoverishment of opportunity, safety and security. Government is
sticking its fingers into every aspect of our lives, making it more
difficult and more expensive to get ahead. By creeping over the limits
on its power, government is switching off the power for growth.
Some government agencies noted for mission creep include, but are
not limited to: the Environmental Protection Agency, the Council on
Environmental Quality, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, and the White House itself.
Overreach is sometimes used when Congress declines to pass a bill
into law. Rather than accept the status quo, the president takes
matters into his own hands with rules or guidance from executive branch
agencies. The result is policies outside of congressional
authorization. In this case, poorly-considered policies are forcing all
Americans to pay more for electricity and transportation, for little or
no benefit--because the new regulations will have a minimal effect on
global temperatures. These costs are falling disproportionately on poor
and middle-class Americans, many of whom voted for President Biden, who
pay a higher share of their income in food and energy costs.

Sadly, there are many examples of regulatory overreach.

The Environmental Protection Agency's attempt to regulate regional
emissions through a novel interpretation of the Clean Air Act, known as
the Clean Power Plan,\2\ proposed in 2015 under President Barack Obama,
was deemed executive overreach by the Supreme Court in West Virginia v.
Environmental Protection Agency. Ruling 6-3 on June 30, 2022, the
Supreme Court decided that the Clean Air Act does not allow the EPA to
move from regulating individual power plants to regulating regional
emissions.

22842.pdf (accessed May 9, 2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although the Clean Air Act allows the EPA to set maximum levels of
new and existing emissions sources, the Clean Power Plan \3\ went
further. If emissions exceeded the EPA's requirements, a state, or
group of states, would be required to shut down power plants or to
install renewable energy sources. The plan was similar to the American
Clean Energy and Security Act, introduced by Democratic Congressmen
Henry Waxman and Edward Markey in 2009, and the American Power Act,
introduced by Senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman in 2010. Neither
bill became law, despite sizable Democratic majorities in both
chambers.

The opinion in West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency,
written by Chief Justice John Roberts, cited the major questions
doctrine, according to which Congress must ``speak clearly if it wishes
to assign to an agency decisions of vast economic and political
significance.'' \4\ Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts
stated that ``EPA claimed to discover an unheralded power representing
a transformative expansion of its regulatory authority in the vague
language of a long-extant, but rarely used, statute designed as a gap
filler. That discovery allowed it to adopt a regulatory program that
Congress had conspicuously declined to enact itself.'' \5\ Justice Neil
Gorsuch elaborated on the major questions doctrine in a concurring
opinion, writing, ``The framers believed that the power to make new
laws regulating private conduct was a grave one that could, if not
properly checked, pose a serious threat to individual liberty.'' \6\

The case has far-reaching implications for other agencies that
could currently be exceeding their statutory limits. The Securities and
Exchange Commission, for example, has proposed requirements for
companies to disclose their exposure to climate risk and to provide
details about the climate effects of their operations. The Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency has appointed a chief climate risk
officer who has decided to do the same.
Executive overreach could also be occurring in other areas. Courts
are in the process of examining whether the Department of Education can
unilaterally cancel or reduce student loans. Meantime, the National
Labor Relations Board is considering making franchise businesses such
as McDonald's accountable for the actions of local franchises. Such
rules could find themselves on the wrong side of the Court's approach,
which found the EPA's rulemaking to be an example of ``agencies
asserting highly consequential power beyond what Congress could
reasonably be understood to have granted.'' \7\ If the Court had found
the other way, EPA could have changed the entire vehicle fleet to
electric vehicles through a change in a regulation.

When federal agencies exceed their authority, opportunities for
ordinary people are stifled. Severe, government-imposed cuts in carbon
emissions raise the cost of electricity and American-made goods. Under
the Clean Power Plan, some states or groups of states would have had to
meet EPA targets by ensuring plants cut emissions or by financing
reductions in other ways, such as suppressing consumer demand or
investing in more costly renewable energy. In any case, carbon
emissions are declining naturally without the plan. Emissions of
energy-related carbon dioxide declined by 18 percent from 2007 to 2021,
according to the Energy Information Administration.\8\ Between 2014,
when the Clean Power Plan was proposed, and 2021, four years after the
Trump administration rescinded it, these emissions fell by 9
percent.\9\

Creeping executive branch oversight of energy started early in the
Administration. On his first day in office, President Biden revoked the
permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have brought 850,000
barrels of oil per day from Canada to be refined in U.S.
refineries.\10\ This reduced energy independence, and higher gasoline
prices and inflation soon followed. President Biden the following year
asked Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to produce more oil. In addition to
eliminating the Keystone XL pipeline, President Biden has reduced oil
and gas production \11\ by expanding the boundaries of the Grand
Staircase-Escalante, Bears Ears, Northeast Canyons, and Seamounts
Marine National Monuments, preventing oil and natural gas production in
those areas.\12\

Charging will also cost more. At the same time as EPA issuing new
rules for automobile emissions, it is also planning new rules for
emissions from power plants, The New York Times has reported.\22\
According to the reports, EPA will regulate carbon dioxide and other
so-called greenhouse gas emissions from both new and existing natural
gas and coal-fired power plants, and require carbon capture systems or
a switch to hydrogen fuels. These systems for capturing carbon are
costly and will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher
electricity rates. Drivers will find it more expensive to use
electricity for all purposes, including charging their electric
vehicles, harming poor and middle-class drivers the most.

Three-quarters of vehicles sold are previously owned cars.\23\ In
2019, the last year for which complete data on used car sales are
available, Americans bought 41 million used cars and 13 million new
cars.\24\ But people do not want to buy used electric vehicles, because
it is difficult to evaluate how long the battery will last. Replacing
an EV battery can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000.\25\ The poor
and the middle class will suffer most from higher prices for used
vehicles, because they cannot afford the new electric vehicles.

Mandating electric vehicles would reduce Americans' standard of
living. Back in the early 1900s, when Henry Ford started producing
cars, only rich Americans could afford them. Throughout the 20th
century cars became less expensive, and many households could afford
not one but two. Cars are already becoming more expensive, and the
proposed rule accelerates that trend, taking America back a century,
when new cars were only for the rich.
Recharging an electric vehicle from empty can take over an hour,
compared to 5 minutes to fill up with gas.\26\ If there is a line to
use the charging station the wait can double. Manufacturers suggest not
allowing EV batteries to go below 20%, and the charging rate goes down
when it is charged over 80%.\27\ Throughout America the poor rarely
have access to indoor garages for overnight charging, and in most large
cities, such as New York City, the middle-class also have no access to
indoor charging. Using charging stations on the street, if available,
risks theft of expensive charging cables.

Battery-powered vehicles lack sufficient range to satisfy most
customers. Although 60 to 70 miles of range is enough for most trips,
people buy cars for all circumstances, including long trips and cold
weather. Batteries lose up to 40% of their range in cold climates and
manufacturers suggest using heating systems.\28\ A study by Autocar
\29\ shows that electric vehicles lose, on average, a third of their
range in the winter, which reduces the typical 240-mile range to 160
miles. If a heat pump is added to the car, the loss is less, but still
the 240-mile range would shrink to 180.

Minerals such as lithium and cobalt are essential for batteries.
Mining for these minerals is energy-intensive, and the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) has substantial access to global mineral sources
for battery production, resulting in a loss of American independence.
Lithium is mined in western China's Qinghai Province, aided by
government funding, and China purchases cobalt for electric batteries
from Kisanfu, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\38\ Our federal
government makes opening new mines in the United States virtually
impossible, even though the jobs generated would help all Americans,
particularly the poor and the middle class. Thus, the rule will result
in a massive increase in mining in countries that have no respect for
the environment or human welfare. The mining of minerals as a result of
the rule will be bad for the environment and is frequently performed by
child workers.

The Council on Environmental Quality, part of the Executive Office
of the President, issued new guidance \39\ on January 9, 2023,
requiring federal agencies to use the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) process to reduce emissions from greenhouse gases. That means
that projects that result in higher greenhouse gas emissions will find
it harder to get NEPA approval. The guidance takes effect immediately,
without waiting for CEQ to address the comments. Some agencies are
including in their compliance with NEPA factors that Congress did not
originally intend. This is an example of a harmful, arbitrary, and
capricious policy.

Other Executive Branch agencies are deviating from traditional
roles of approving investments and instead are slowing production and
transportation of oil and natural gas. For instance, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission proposed a new policy \40\ on February 17, 2022,
that would have made it even harder to put new pipelines in place to
carry oil and gas from the interior of the country to the coasts, where
it can be exported. FERC was intending to ``consider a proposed
project's impacts on existing pipelines'' as well as the environmental
effects of the new pipeline. The February 2022 policy statement was
pulled back and deemed a ``draft'' in March 2022 due to public
pressure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even though the policy statements have been downgraded to ``draft''
status, they have not been officially withdrawn, and regulatory
uncertainty at FERC is slowing the development of pipelines. Last week
FERC Commissioner James Danly said at a hearing before the Senate
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, ``The consequences of
premature retirements and resource scarcity are even more acute when
you consider the constraints on natural gas supply resulting from the
underdevelopment of interstate natural gas infrastructure--again,
driven by the FERC's maladministration of the Natural Gas Act. Although
I am genuinely delighted that the Commission has recently increased the
pace of natural gas pipeline reviews, the policies FERC recently sought
to promulgate have had the very effects I predicted at last year's
hearing: according to the Energy Information Administration, 2022 saw
the lowest quantity of additional capacity added to the natural gas
pipeline system since 1995, the obvious result of the FERC's slow
walking natural gas pipeline applications over the last two years and
the chilling effect of the regulatory uncertainty created by the
Commission's issuances. Interstate natural gas infrastructure is
absolutely critical: as coal, nuclear and hydroelectric generators
retire due to subsidies and public policy choices, the need for natural
gas to ensure system reliability continues to grow.\41\

The Defense Department, whose mission is to defend the United
States, wants to use biofuels to make its military vehicles and jets
more climate friendly. Such vehicles are less resilient and more
costly, so the Pentagon would be able to afford fewer of them, with
major effects on national security.
The Federal Trade Commission is considering investigating oil and
gas companies for price gouging--even though people know that lower
supply always leads to higher prices.
With prices of new and used cars higher, the biggest loser from
runaway government is the American consumer, who will purchase fewer
new cars, which have additional safety features and better fuel
economy. More people will be injured or killed in car crashes.
Mandating electrics won't solve problems of environmental justice.
Requiring sales of electric vehicles discriminates against low-income
Americans who cannot as easily afford expensive electric cars. Upper-
income urban Americans buy Teslas; lower-income rural Americans buy
pickup trucks and large vehicles. Mandating sales of electrics helps
the rich and hurts the poor.

plants. America has 225 coal-fired power plants, and China has 1,118
(half of all the coal-fired plants in the world).\53\ That is one
reason why China has increased carbon emissions by over 5,000 million
metric tons over the past 16 years.\54\ In contrast, America's carbon
emissions have declined by over 1,000 million metric tons over the same
period due to the use of clean natural gas.\55\

Rather than kowtowing to China, companies should reject
environmental policies that raise the costs of doing business and favor
the CCP. The rush to a green energy future, driven more by politics and
virtue-signaling than economics and emissions reductions, will only
enrich China at America's expense and place vital energy supply chains
at mercy of Beijing.
China has not committed to reducing emissions until 2027. Research
by Dr. Kevin Dayaratna, chief statistician and senior research fellow
at The Heritage Foundation, has shown that even completely eliminating
all fossil fuels from the United States would result in less than 0.2
degrees Celsius in temperature mitigation by 2100.\58\ Americans,

STATEMENT OF JEREMY HARRELL, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER, CLEARPATH,
WASHINGTON, DC

Mr. Harrell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Great to see you, and
great to see many other familiar faces on both sides of the
dais. My name is Jeremy Harrell, and I am the Chief Strategy
Officer of ClearPath, and thank you for the opportunity to
testify today.
America's energy demands are rapidly increasing. By some
estimates, the United States will need to double the capacity
of the grid by 2050 to meet expected energy demand.
Unfortunately, building energy infrastructure at that pace is
procedurally impossible in today's regulatory environment.
Never has the phrase ``time is money'' been more appropriate.
The combination of permitting delays and ping-pong decisions
from administrations past and present make projects exceedingly
expensive.
Fortunately, fixing this outdated system is at the top of
the congressional agenda. This Committee has rightly put
permitting reform front and center, passing with bipartisan
support the Lower Energy Costs Act as H.R. 1. The bill
addresses many bottlenecks that make the current system a
quagmire: unnecessary duplication, a morass of reviews across
multiple agencies, and superfluous legal action. Solving these
challenges will create jobs, boost energy security, and reduce
global emissions, all while providing safety and environmental
protection for all our communities.
Project developers are ready to build today. The important
thing is for policymakers to keep an eye on the prize. The next
step in the process cannot be to water down H.R. 1 into
something milquetoast that fails to change our broken system.
As bipartisan efforts continue in both the House and Senate, I
would like to highlight three pillars of reform that must be
expanded upon to unlock our energy future: (1) restore
predictability to the system; (2) provide more streamlined
litigation; and (3) improve coordination between Federal,
state, and local governments.
To restore predictability, we must flip the permitting
paradigm from a system that favors stopping a project to one
that expedites the approval of projects that bring net
benefits. The status quo is overwhelmingly tilted toward those
who seek to delay or block projects. That may have made sense
four decades ago, but today it is actually resulting in
increased emissions and environmental degradation. We need a
system that promotes good outcomes, both economic and
environmental. That means projects that do not have an
environmental impact should be granted immediate approval. This
approach, similar to permit-by-rule concepts some states have
implemented, allow pre-qualified technologies proven to have
minimal environmental impacts and immense positive outcomes to
move forward without delay.
Additionally, designating a list of pre-qualified
geographic areas such as brownfields is also reasonable. The
environmental impacts of new development in these locations is
minimal and, in many cases, they are near the communities that
need the redevelopment the most. That would be a win-win for
the environment and the economy. And if you take those no-
brainer projects out of the way, you have more time and
resources to focus on more complicated projects.
Critically, Federal action can no longer vacillate
according to political whims, particularly when the Congress
has acted. Developers must be able to rely on decisions from
one administration to the next. We have seen this pointedly,
particularly in mining, like the Resolution Copper mine in
Arizona or the Twin Metals Project in Minnesota. This
Administration's tortured approach increases U.S. reliance on
minerals sourced from overseas, including from countries that
lack basic environmental and human rights protections. Our
system should create jobs here, promote American innovation,
and foster better global environmental outcomes.
Second, once a project is approved, any further
adjudication should move quickly. Litigation under NEPA has
become the favored tools of those who seek to indefinitely
delay projects. Such prominent examples include the Cape Wind
Project off the coast of Massachusetts and the Atlantic Coast
pipeline connecting the Utica and Marcellus gas fields to
Appalachia, where excessive legal challenges to Federal and
State permits forced developers to cut their losses.
Recent history has shown clean energy projects are not
immune to these delay tactics. Any changes to judicial review
must balance a plaintiff's right to be heard with the goal of
reaching finality on a more predictable timeline. This could be
accomplished by immediately elevating any legal challenge under
NEPA to Federal appellate courts. Ultimately, legal disputes
must be resolved in less than a year.
And finally, it is important to embrace federalism where
appropriate, and return more permitting authority to the people
who know the communities the best. One recent example is Class
VI wells for carbon capture projects. While many states have
long held enforcement authority for other well classes, only
North Dakota and Wyoming have been granted primacy by the EPA
for permanent CO
2
storage. To gain primacy, a state
must prove their standards are as rigorous as the Federal
standards. Whereas the EPA has taken 6 years to permit a Class
VI well, it took North Dakota only 5 months to do so after
receiving primacy.
These Federal delays are particularly egregious, given that
the Department of Energy is investing billions of dollars to
deploy new carbon capture technologies that we need. These
types of measures would improve efficiency with no different
environmental outcome. So, why wouldn't we shift the authority
to the people closest to the geology?
In conclusion, the challenges are numerous, but Republican
and Democratic policy-makers have never been more closely
aligned on the need for permitting reform. Whether the
motivation is climate, economic growth, or energy security, it
is well past time to fix what is broken. ClearPath looks
forward to working with this Committee to push reform across
the finish line. Thank you.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Harrell follows:]
Prepared Statement of Jeremy Harrell, ClearPath, Inc., Chief Strategy
Officer
Good afternoon Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member Stansbury and members
of the Committee. My name is Jeremy Harrell, and I am the Chief
Strategy Officer of ClearPath, a 501(c)(3) organization that develops
and advances policies that accelerate innovations to reduce and remove
global energy emissions.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today and for holding this
important hearing. America's energy demands are rapidly increasing.
Some estimates say the U.S. will need to double the capacity of the
grid by 2050 to meet expected clean energy demand. To support that grid
modernization and U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, America will
simultaneously need to construct tens of thousands of miles of new
pipelines carrying natural gas, hydrogen, and captured carbon dioxide
from power plants and industrial facilities.
Financing and building enough energy infrastructure projects to
meet our nation's need for reliable, affordable cleaner energy is an
immense challenge. Recent projections show that 1,300 gigawatts of new
clean energy would need to be added by 2035. This would more than
double the grid's current capacity within the next 12 years. But under
the current regulatory environment, this pace of deployment is
procedurally impossible.
Never has the phrase ``time is money'' been more appropriate.
Regulatory delays that can last nearly a decade are making projects
more expensive, and impeding the U.S.' ability to deploy billions of
dollars of capital that would create American jobs, enhance U.S. energy
security, keep consumer costs affordable, and reduce emissions.
The Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) own data shows that on
average it takes agencies 4.5 years to issue a Record of Decision for
an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).\1\ But the average belies the
real challenge. In reality, 10 percent of projects took 10 years or
more to reach a Record of Decision. The projects most likely to be held
up in permitting purgatory are those that have the potential to offer
the greatest benefits to the United States, including reduced energy
costs, enhanced energy independence, increased economic opportunity,
and lower global emissions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current system is broken. The structures in place are
overwhelmingly titled toward those who seek to delay or block projects
as opposed to those who seek to build. While that dynamic may have made
sense four decades ago when policymakers enacted these laws as a
response to environmental disasters, today, those laws are being used
to block projects that will reduce emissions and improve environmental
quality. We need a system that promotes good outcomes--both economic
and environmental. The pace and scale necessary to build clean energy
infrastructure projects to reliably meet America's energy demand and
reduce emissions is not something the authors of the 1970s
environmental laws could have imagined.
The energy infrastructure we need today is simply not getting built
fast enough, and throwing federal money at the projects or the agencies
reviewing them is not going to substantially change that problem. The
combination of permitting delays and ``ping-ponged'' decisions from
Administrations past and present have disrupted the U.S. ability to
build to fulfill needs. As a result, it can now take six years to
permit carbon dioxide storage locations needed to store billions of
tons captured from industrial sites, 16 years to permit an offshore
wind farm in Massachusetts, and up to 15 years for a new transmission
line from Wyoming to Utah.
2,3,4
Another important example is
the need for timely approval of a new LNG terminal as well as any
necessary interstate natural gas pipelines to supply these new
terminals. These are just a few of the hundreds of projects held up by
the status quo of the current system.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fortunately, fixing this outdated, broken system is at the top of
the agenda this Congress. This Committee has rightly put permitting
reform front and center this year, passing with bipartisan support its
signature energy package, the Lower Energy Costs Act, as H.R. 1.
This bill addresses bottlenecks that make the current system a
quagmire: unnecessary duplication, a morass of reviews across multiple
agencies, and superfluous legal action. Solving these challenges will
reduce emissions, increase production and boost U.S. energy security,
all while providing safety and environmental protection for local
communities.
Project developers are ready to build today. There is real
opportunity for this Congress to work on a bipartisan basis to
modernize the permitting process. The important thing is policymakers
keep an eye on the prize. Senate action cannot simply water down H.R. 1
into something milquetoast that fails to fundamentally change the
current regulatory regime.
This is underscored by recent proposals released this month, as
leaders in the key Senate committees on both sides of the aisle have
put forward their own proposals, including many concepts that match
themes included in H.R. 1.

As the permitting reform effort continues in both the U.S. House
and Senate, I will highlight three key solutions that have been
identified by project developers, former federal officials, academics
and environmental non-governmental organizations.

1. Restore predictability to the system;

2. Provide more streamlined litigation; and

3. Improve coordination between and among federal, state and local
governments.

American entrepreneurs have the wind at their backs to deploy more
energy projects now. Congress has come together in a bipartisan manner,
with bills like the CHIPS and Science Act and the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), to bring new technologies to the market
and invest in American supply chains. 2022 saw record industry
investment in energy, with the largest boost in recent years coming
from the power sector.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2022/
overview-and-key-findings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
But again, simply spending more money on new projects will not
necessarily make them a reality. Without meaningful permitting reform,
there is a real risk that these major investments in technologies that
the globe needs, such as carbon capture, advanced nuclear, and
geothermal will go unrealized. And the U.S. will miss out on an
opportunity to lead a global energy transformation.
While these challenges are numerous, Republican and Democratic
policymakers have never been more closely aligned on the need for
significant permitting reform. Whether the motivation is climate,
economic growth, more energy production, or energy supply chain
security, it is well-past time to fix what is broken, as America's
energy, environmental, and economic future depends on sweeping reform.
Restore Predictability to the System

Reform must flip the permitting paradigm from one that favors
stopping a project to one that expedites the approval process for
projects that bring net benefits and comply with the legal requirements
meant to ensure clean water and clean air. This approach would rely on
a three-pronged approach that automatically advances projects with
significant net benefits, focuses environmental and permit review on
uniquely local conditions of a project on an accelerated timeline
review, and keeps the relevant agencies within the boundaries of the
laws Congress has enacted. Many of these concepts were included in H.R.
1, and it is important a final bill doubles down on the concept and
maximizes their impact.

First, projects that do not have an environmental impact should be
granted immediate approval. For example, replacing a retiring power
plant with a zero-emissions advanced nuclear generator at an existing
site or building a solar project on a brownfield site should not
require a yearslong permitting process. Advancing these types of
projects without delay is a win-win. The economic and environmental
benefits of these projects should not be delayed by unnecessary
bureaucracy.
There should be criteria to prequalify technologies that are proven
to have minimal environmental impacts and immense positive outcomes--
similar to ``permit-by-rule'' concepts some states have implemented. In
other words, there should be a presumption of project approval so long
as the specifics of a project satisfy certain predefined criteria. In
many cases, this would alleviate the requirement to do unnecessary
boilerplate re-analysis.
One starting point could be to automatically advance projects that
have nationally significant outcomes, like enhancing resilience of the
grid or a significant reduction of global emissions, where the
environmental impacts of development are well known. For example, a
carbon capture retrofit of an existing facility, the modernization of a
grid substation, or powering of a non-powered dam. H.R. 1 took a
similar tack for energy storage projects at existing facilities and
maintenance or upgrades to existing transmission and distribution
infrastructure.
Similarly, designating a list of prequalified geographic areas to
encourage project sponsors to seek out specific locations, would go a
long way toward accelerating projects with the lowest impact. Such
areas could include previously disturbed locations or well categorized
sites, such as brownfield sites that present opportunities to use
existing electrical or mechanical infrastructure or former military
bases. The environmental impacts to these locations related to energy
deployment are minimal, and in many cases these locations are in or
near communities that need the redevelopment most urgently. Congress
could also consider regulatory incentives to direct investment toward
areas where impacts are already well understood.
Another opportunity could be to pair existing financial incentives,
such as the ``Opportunity Zones'' or ``Energy Communities''
classifications established by Congress, with a streamlined permitting
process to further boost investment. Both Opportunity Zones and Energy
Communities were established by Congress to drive investment in
distressed areas and communities that would benefit the most from new
energy investments. Matching financial incentives with regulatory
certainty will create a clear signal to project developers during the
site selection process. Coordinated incentives like these can help
drive investment to previously underserved areas and ensure the
benefits of clean energy reach these communities without unnecessary
delays.
Some of the most egregious problems of our broken system would be
solved by this type of reform. For example, nonsensical approaches to
geothermal exploration inhibit our ability of scaling baseload clean
energy at scale. The Department of Energy estimates that geothermal
generation could double by 2035 if our immense potential was unleashed.
But concurrently, the Department found that ``because additional steps
and NEPA analyses are required, confirming the resource is more costly
and risky,'' translating to permitting timelines of 5-7 years, rather
than a 1-3 year period that would otherwise be available with a
categorical exclusion.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2019/06/f63/
GeoVision-full-report-opt.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Geothermal energy uses similar technology as oil and gas
exploration and drilling activities. When oil and gas uses this
technology, these resource confirmation (e.g. exploration) activities
benefit from statutory authority enacted by the Energy Policy Act of
2005 that expedites five types of development activities. However, when
the same mechanisms are used to confirm a geothermal energy resource,
the expedited pathway does not apply. As a result, two very similar
methods to test for resource feasibility must undergo substantially
different permitting reviews despite both having negligible
environmental impact. The Bureau of Land Management has the authority
to administratively grant this same expedited pathway for geothermal
energy resources, yet has wrung its hands for years rather than simply
updating its regulatory guidance. This system is clearly broken.
Further, departments should proactively consult with other agencies
to identify existing NEPA categorical exclusions available to
accelerate development of energy infrastructure projects. DOE's recent
Request for Information (RFI) to adopt new Categorical Exclusions is a
model that should be replicated across other federal agencies.

Second, reform must streamline the approval process for projects
where there are unique environmental impacts. In these cases, the
review process could focus specifically on issues of the highest
impact, resulting in more efficient timelines that still ensure
compliance with existing environmental laws.
There are several provisions that have earned broad bipartisan
support, including applying the ``One Federal Decision'' framework to
energy projects. Similar support exists to reuse existing environmental
review documents when a project will have substantially similar impacts
as one previously studied. These provisions are both included in H.R. 1
and other proposals that have been recently made public. Those
principles should be expanded upon.
One immense opportunity that could be fostered by reforms like this
is in new nuclear technologies. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) has publicly stated it anticipates at least 13 applications for
advanced reactors by 2027, technologies that could bring safe,
flexible, and reliable clean energy to our energy system.\7\ Decades of
operation have shown that nuclear energy has a minimal environmental
impact. Future designs hold the same promise.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML22038A001
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the dawn of the nuclear age in the 1950s, nuclear reactors
have been supplying Americans with clean, reliable, and affordable
energy. On a bipartisan basis in the 115th, 116th, and 117th
Congresses, legislation has been passed that strengthens the U.S.
nuclear industry. However, except for the Vogtle Unit 3 reactor that
recently came online in Georgia, the vast majority of nuclear plants in
the United States were constructed over 40 years ago.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=228&t=3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is changing today. The advanced reactor market is at an
inflection point. Investors and potential end-users are closely
watching first-of-a-kind utility-scale projects eyeing the late 2020s
and early 2030s for commercial operation. American electric utilities
are projecting a need for 90 GW of new nuclear power by 2050, nearly
doubling our nuclear energy capacity in the next 30 years.\9\
Simplifying the permitting for projects like TerraPower's flagship
project in Kemmerer, Wyoming, which is leveraging the infrastructure at
a retiring coal plant, is a no brainer. A nuclear facility is different
from a coal-fired power plant, but many of the environmental factors
that must be considered are similar. Additionally, many advanced
reactors are looking to develop alongside industrial facilities or
existing nuclear sites, where previous environmental analysis and
community engagement has been extensive. A rational permitting system
would leverage that work to accelerate exciting projects, not force
needless duplication.

Third, federal action can no longer vacillate according to
political whims, particularly when the Congress has acted. Given long
development timelines needed to bring a project from financing to
construction, project developers need to be able to rely on regulatory
certainty from one Administration to the next. This need is perhaps
most acute for projects that seek to unlock critical minerals.
While the Administration has announced award selections worth a
combined total of nearly $5 billion for critical minerals demonstration
projects funded by the bipartisan infrastructure bill and other new
programs, there remains one glaring omission in the critical minerals
supply chain: none of these selected projects addresses our inability
to extract new materials domestically.\10\ The International Energy
Agency (IEA) predicts that demand for energy-related minerals like
lithium, cobalt, graphite, and nickel could grow by 20-40 times by
2040.\11\ The U.S. will not be able to recycle its way out of this
demand for critical minerals.

\10\ https://www.clearpath.org/clearpath-infrastructure-tracker/
\11\ https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-
clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is difficult to overstate the U.S. dependence on foreign supply
chains, including reliance on China. According to the 2023 U.S.
Geological Survey's Mineral Commodities Summary, the U.S. was 100
percent net import reliant for 12 of the 50 individually listed
critical minerals and was more than 50 percent net import reliant for
an additional 31 critical mineral commodities.\12\ Meanwhile, China was
the leading producing nation for 30 of the 50 critical minerals.\13\
Regardless of where the minerals are mined, China exerts dominant
control over the refining process for many of these critical minerals.
Rising demand for minerals will place major stress on global supply
chains and undermine the ability of the U.S. to deploy more clean
energy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\12\ https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/mcs2023
\13\ ibid
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the most prominent examples of America's inability to permit
mines is Resolution Copper, which Congress explicitly authorized when
the Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act was enacted
into law with the Carl Levin and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (P.L. 113-291). Once
approved, the proposed mine is expected to become the largest copper
mine in North America, capable of producing up to 25 percent of U.S.
copper demand each year.\14\ The proposal received a final EIS in
January 2021, only to have it unpublished by the Biden administration
two months later.\15\ The Administration is explicitly subverting
Congressional intent with this project. These unnecessary delays
precede a decade of construction before operations can begin, bringing
the project timeline to at least two full decades from its inception.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\14\ https://resolutioncopper.com/project-overview/
\15\ https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r3/home/?cid=FSEPRD858166
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This back and forth regulatory review is far too common. The
Resolution Copper Mine is just one of many examples. And the regulatory
overreach deters investors, increases capital costs, and delays the
energy security benefits of developing a robust domestic supply chain
for clean energy and related infrastructure.
Absent a clear, predictable, and streamlined process, America will
continue to rely on critical minerals sourced from overseas, including
from countries that pose national security risks or those that lack
basic environmental and human rights protections. The choice should be
clear: producing American resources here at home creates jobs, promotes
innovation, increases energy security, and leads to better global
environmental outcomes.
Provide more streamlined litigation

Once a project is approved, any further adjudications should be
addressed as expeditiously as possible to ensure that protracted
litigation does not undermine project viability. Judicial review is the
biggest wildcard in the current permitting system, and H.R. 1
appropriately recognized it as an area that could have the most
meaningful impact toward efficient project deliverability. Establishing
requirements where any legal disputes must be resolved in less than one
year would meaningfully address this uncertainty.
In the spirit of the current system rewarding those who seek to
delay rather than those who seek to build, litigation under NEPA has
become the favored tool of those who seek to indefinitely delay
projects through procedural lawsuits. Such prominent examples include
the saga of the proposed Cape Wind project off the coast of
Massachusetts, where protracted litigation, including more than 20
administrative and judicial challenges to both federal and state
reviews, ultimately led utilities to cancel power purchase agreements,
effectively killing the project.\16\ While no single suit ever
specifically terminated the project, the purposeful delay tactics
requiring evermore environmental analysis ultimately led investors to
pull the plug. This same playbook is now being used to protest the
approval for the Vineyard Wind project, despite new state laws that
mandate utilities to procure offshore wind energy.\17\

capecodonline/graphics/pdf/GridFMNotice.pdf
\17\ https://www.eenews.net/articles/4-lawsuits-threaten-vineyard-
wind/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP) is another prime example in which
legal uncertainty contributed to an untenable business environment
leading project developers to cancel the project and take a loss. ACP
was intended to bring natural gas access to residential, commercial,
defense, and industrial customers in Virginia and North Carolina, but
legal challenges to federal and state permits contributed to more than
three years of delays and increased project costs from $8 billion from
an original estimate of $5 billion.
Additionally ,the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) from northwestern
West Virginia to southern Virginia has also attracted extensive
Congressional attention because of similar uncertainty. No doubt, the
expected build out of gas, hydrogen, and CO2 pipelines needed to meet
our future system demands requires a more predictable process for the
private sector to deliver on these projects.
As more clean energy projects enter the permitting process, clean
energy projects will increasingly find themselves subject to these
delay tactics. Such actions too often delay significant economic and
environmental benefits, like new clean energy generation from that wind
farm or the net reduction in global emissions from the use of lower
emissions U.S. gas relative to dirtier Russian supplies in Europe.
These increases in emissions or environmental harm are the very
outcomes that NEPA was enacted to avoid and prevent.
Any changes to judicial review must balance a plaintiff's right to
have his or her day in court with the goal of reaching finality on a
more predictable timeline. One such proposal would be to immediately
elevate any legal challenge under NEPA to the federal appellate court
where the project is to be constructed or alternatively the DC Circuit.
This would be similar to the process already used to challenge agency
decisions, including those made by FERC.
Improve Coordination with State and Local Governments

Finally, it is important to recognize and address, to the maximum
extent practicable, challenging permitting projects at the state and
local level--without trampling on federalism.
An example of an unpredictable regulatory environment is the
prolonged delay to review and approve permits for Class VI underground
injection control wells needed to permanently sequester carbon dioxide.
Class VI wells are a necessary part of the carbon capture equation of
preventing more emissions and are the only authorized method permitted
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to sequester carbon
dioxide in permanent geologic storage.
While many states have long held primary enforcement authority for
other well classes, only North Dakota and Wyoming have received primacy
for this newest well class established in 2010. Congress rightly
included provisions in the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act and the
IIJA directing the EPA to support states applying for Class VI primacy
and to actively improve the Class VI permitting review process.\18\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The advantages of state primacy for Class VI wells are readily
apparent in North Dakota. Whereas the EPA has taken an average of three
years to permit Class VI wells, it took North Dakota only five months.
The EPA currently has more than 70 pending applications across eight
states awaiting regulatory approval.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\19\ https://www.epa.gov/uic/class-vi-wells-permitted-epa
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This backlog is a prime example of where this Administration is
working against its own priorities. The Department of Energy is
investing billions of dollars to deploy new carbon capture technologies
now, while the EPA muddles through reviews of storage sites at a
palatial pace and the Department of the Interior stands in the way of
related infrastructure projects across regions prime for commercial
scale up.
The most egregious example may be in Louisiana. After years of
delay, the Administration finally issued the draft rule necessary to
approve Louisiana's request for Class VI primacy earlier this month.
This initiates a 60-day comment period and a subsequent EPA response
period that historically can take upwards of a year for a state to be
granted final authority.\20\ Once final, the decision is likely to have
an immediate impact as 10 of the current outstanding Class VI permits
are located in the state, which could unlock up to 6 million tons of
carbon dioxide per year in Louisiana alone. If Republican and
Democratic policy makers did not lean into the federal agencies in
recent oversight hearings, this rule would likely still be stuck in the
bureaucracy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is clear that the time to transfer Class VI authority should be
improved for the other states looking to obtain primacy such as
Pennsylvania, Arizona, Texas, and West Virginia, which are preparing
applications for Class VI primacy. To date, primacy is the number one
tool to get these projects permitted quickly, while preserving the
safety of local communities. Additionally, this would allow federal
agencies to focus their energies on permits in states not-yet equipped
to take on permitting primacy or accelerate review of storage
opportunities on federal lands or the Outer Continental Shelf, which
have immense potential to contribute to our long-term energy future.
Similar barriers exist for proposed transmission lines that can
better connect both new and existing generation assets to load as
timelines to get new transmission projects developed now routinely
stretch to over a decade.
One example is the SunZia line, designed to move power from New
Mexico to California. The 550 mile line required cooperation from 10
federal agencies, 5 state agencies, and 9 local authorities while
incorporating input from a host of additional state, local, and federal
stakeholders. Projected to come online in 2025, the 3.5 GW project,
which would provide power for millions of customers, will have taken
over 17 years from proposal to completion.\21\ These timelines,
complicated by the intersection of different requirements from federal,
state, tribal, and local regulators, impede the ability of new projects
to interconnect to the grid.

\21\ https://www.power-grid.com/td/sunzia-transmission-line-is-a-
win-but-also-a-lesson-in-what-not-to-do/#gref
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, there are 2000 GW
of electricity and storage waiting in the interconnection queue to be
connected to the grid.\22\ While not all of these projects will be
built, this figure is nearly double the current system capacity as it
exists today. This backlog is especially relevant as hundreds of
gigawatts of clean energy projects spend years stuck in the
interconnection process, awaiting evaluation by transmission providers
to determine their impact on the broader system. An average completion
rate of 21% and queue wait time of 4 years makes meeting any target for
a reliable and affordable clean energy system infeasible.\23\ It is
also important to note that analysis recently conducted by the regional
transmission organization (RTO) PJM estimates that 40 GW of baseload
generation, more than 21 percent of current installed capacity, is at
risk of retirement by 2030 without reliable generation lined up to
replace it and keep up with demand growth.\24\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While there is no silver bullet to rapidly and reliably modernize
the grid, a combination of process improvements, permitting reforms,
and technological innovation will help avoid clean energy deployment
from hitting a wall.
Conclusion

The current permitting system stymies clean energy resources and
broadly delays the highest impact projects from delivering benefits. It
is imperative that Congress address both aspects of the permitting
process to maximize public and private sector investments and put steel
in the ground. These pillars of pre-qualification to expedite review,
more streamlined litigation, and improved coordination with state and
local governments are priorities that merit consideration as the
process to reach a permitting deal moves forward.
These reforms are ambitious by design as half measures have failed
to move the needle for more than two decades. Anything less will only
prolong the inability of the U.S. to build big things.
We look forward to working with this Committee to both further
legislative action on regulatory reform and to reign in executive
branch overreach. I look forward to today's discussion.

STATEMENT OF JAMIE PLEUNE, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR (RESEARCH), S.J.
QUINNEY COLLEGE OF LAW, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, SALT LAKE CITY,
UTAH

Ms. Pleune. Thank you, Chairman Gosar, Ranking Member
Stansbury, and members of the Committee for the opportunity to
be here today. My name is Jamie Pleune. I am an Associate
Professor at the University of Utah Law School. We have done
extensive empirical research on NEPA and its implementation
times.
Little is known about the National Environmental Policy Act
and its process. The data that is available focuses exclusively
on environmental impact statements. To address this shortage of
information, my colleagues, John Ruple and Erik Heiny, and I
undertook the most comprehensive analysis of NEPA decision
making that has been conducted. We analyzed 16 years of Forest
Service data, which was 41,000 NEPA decisions.
The first question that we sought to answer was how long
does the NEPA process really take? We found that the median
time to complete an EIS was 2.8 years. For an EA, it was 1.2
years. And for a CE, it was only 4 months. These evidence-based
time frames are dramatically shorter than the anecdotal time
frames that are often cited.
We also reaffirmed the GAO estimate. The EISs are an
extremely small percentage of all NEPA decisions. Specifically
within the Forest Service, who conducts more EISs than any
other agency, EISs constitute only 2 percent of all decisions.
The other 98 percent face less rigorous review. To put this in
perspective very roughly, when we looked at the evidence over
16 years, only 200 decisions took longer than 4 years, and
33,000 took less than 1 year. The median time for projects that
have identified, known, well-understood, and insignificant
impacts is 4 months.
We also looked for reasons for delay. We developed a
regression analysis that was able to look at NEPA-specific
factors, and we found that those could only predict 25 percent
of the variation. This meant that the primary causes of delay
were external to the NEPA regulatory process. We found that the
primary causes of delay are a lack of agency capacity,
specifically projects hit bottlenecks when there are
insufficient staff members to review a permit, or when there
are not enough staff members with the expertise that is
necessary to review a permit.
Additionally, unstable budgets and outdated technology
caused delays. There were also delays in waiting for
information from the operator.
And finally, compliance with other laws and coordinating
with other agencies or coordinating within a team that is
approving a permit also caused delay. This finding was
consistent with an observation made by the Congressional
Research Service that NEPA often functions as an umbrella
statute. That is, it serves as a framework for compliance with
other laws and regulatory requirements. Delays caused by
compliance with those other legal standards are reflected in
the NEPA process, but NEPA itself is not the cause of delay.
This interplay is visible in a study conducted by Amanda
Miner regarding Forest Service litigation. Her research
recognized that NEPA litigation usually involves multiple legal
claims. Focusing on the cases in which the Forest Service lost,
her research showed that 69 percent of the time the Forest
Service would have lost, even if NEPA did not exist. This is
important because reforms that focus solely on speeding up NEPA
completion times may compromise agency's ability to comply with
the mandates of other laws, which would ultimately create more
delay in implementing projects.
After completing the study of Forest Service decision
making, we looked at the mine permitting process. We found the
same three primary causes of delay have consistently been
identified in research investigation since 1999. So, what does
this tell us about permit reform?
First, the biggest source of delay is a lack of staff and
unstable budgets. The most important thing to improve permit
processing time is to bolster agency capacity. They must have
sufficient staff and staff with relevant expertise. With
expanded capacity, agencies can engage in pre-application
meetings with project sponsors and encourage early engagement
with stakeholders.
This will address the second cause of delay: waiting for
information from operators.
Finally, encouraging coordination between permitting
authorities is a way to streamline the permitting process and
make it more predictable. The procedures incorporated through
FAST-41 have been effective in achieving predictability,
transparency, and improved timelines. Significantly, this is
important because these are the most complex projects
available. Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Professor Jamie Pleune, University of Utah, S.J.
Quinney College of Law
Thank you, Chairman Gosar and Ranking Member Stansbury for the
opportunity to testify today. My name is Jamie Pleune. I am an
Associate Professor of Law (Research) at the S.J. Quinney College of
Law, University of Utah and a Wallace Stegner Center Fellow.
The Wallace Stegner Center provides objective and actionable
research on contemporary environmental issues. The non-partisan Law and
Policy Program at the Wallace Stegner Center has done extensive
empirical research into different aspects of the National Environmental
Policy Act and its implementation. My testimony today reflects the
results of that research and my personal observations. I do not speak
on behalf of the University of Utah, and the views I express do not
necessarily represent the views of the state of Utah, or the University
of Utah.
I. Research Does Not Substantiate the Claim that NEPA Causes Delays

The National Environmental Policy Act is often blamed for delays in
the permitting process. However, research does not support that
characterization. Multiple studies have found that the NEPA analysis is
rarely the primary cause of delay, even though delays may be reflected
in the NEPA process.\1\ Analysis on a project may stop and restart for
external reasons such as funding, engineering requirements, changes in
agency priorities, delays in obtaining non-federal approvals, or
political opposition to the project.\2\ These delays create the
appearance of a long NEPA process, because the NEPA process marks a
public beginning and ending, even though the NEPA analysis did not
cause the delay.\3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally, the NEPA process may provide the structure for
multiple different and independent permitting decisions. As the
Congressional Research Service observed, ``Most agencies use NEPA as an
umbrella statute--that is, a framework to coordinate or demonstrate
compliance with any studies, reviews, or consultations required by any
other environmental laws.'' \4\ This can create confusion because the
need to comply with another law may be identified during the NEPA
process, but NEPA is not the source of the obligation.\5\ In fact,
there is some evidence that the structure provided by the NEPA analysis
actually reduces decisionmaking times.\6\

designations subject to NEPA review were completed an average of 93
days faster than those that were not subject to NEPA review).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The NEPA process can also reduce costs by identifying design
problems before implementation of a project begins. A study prepared
for the Transportation Research Board emphasized this potential
benefit. ``Spending more monies during planning and design will reduce
the time and cost required for construction by avoiding unforeseen
conditions, reducing to a minimum design errors and omissions, and
developing schemes that will support the most efficient approach to
construction.'' \7\ For these reasons, projects exempted from NEPA may
not be faster or cheaper. Instead of achieving speed by exempting
projects from NEPA, permit reform should distinguish between productive
and unproductive delays in the permitting process,\8\ and focus on
eliminating the latter.

II. NEPA Decisionmaking Times Vary Significantly and Projects That
Encounter Extensive Delays Are the Exception, Not the Norm

Working with my colleague, John Ruple, and another colleague, Erik
Heiny, at Utah Valley University, we analyzed 41,000 NEPA decisions
made by the Forest Service at all levels of review.\9\ This is one of
the most comprehensive investigations into NEPA decisionmaking times
that has been undertaken.\10\

President, Council on Env't Quality, Environmental Impact Statement
Timelines (2010-2018) 1 (June 12, 2020) (providing description of
government-wide EIS decisionmaking times).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first question we sought to answer was, ``how long does the
NEPA process actually take?'' We found that the median time to complete
an EIS was 2.8 years. For an EA, it was 1.2 years. And for a CE, the
median was only 4 months.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ Id. at 293.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
More importantly, only 2 percent of all decisions were made through
an EIS.\12\ The other 98% of NEPA decisions faced less rigorous review.
The median time for projects with well-understood and insignificant
impacts was only 4 months.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\12\ Id. at 289. See also Government Accountability Office, GAO-14-
379, National Environmental Policy Act: Little Information Exists on
NEPA Analyses 8 (Apr. 2014) (estimating that government-wide, less than
1% of NEPA decisions are EISs, 5% are EAs, and 95% are CEs).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This approach makes sense. Projects with insignificant and well-
understood impacts should receive quick approval, and the research
shows that they usually do. On the other hand, projects that will
impose significant impacts on communities, create hazards to health,
threaten clean water, compromise clean air, or destroy natural
resources deserve more rigorous review. The permitting process ensures
that each project adheres to basic environmental and safety standards.
The NEPA process creates a mechanism to explore whether a potentially
harmful project can be adjusted to avoid, reduce, or mitigate harmful
consequences. This approach has protected communities and resources
from poorly contemplated projects for over 50 years.
While there are ways, which I will discuss, to improve the
efficiency of permitting and the NEPA process, eliminating
environmental standards or reducing analytical rigor is a poor choice
that does not address the true sources of unproductive delay.
III. True Causes of Delay Can Be Addressed Without Compromising
Environmental or Safety Standards

Permit reform should be driven by accurate data that defines the
scope of the problem. The available data indicates that only a small
percentage of NEPA decisions encounter excessive delays of the type
that are commonly relied upon as anecdotal evidence.
For example, in 2016, the Government Accountability Office studied
processing times for mine permit applications.\13\ Between 2010 and
2014, the BLM and the Forest Service approved 68 mine plans of
operations. The majority (55%) were processed in less than 18 months,
and 63% were processed in under two years. The remaining 37% were
spread across a wide timeframe, with only six applications (less than
10%) taking longer than four years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\ GAO, Hardrock Mining: BLM and Forest Service Have Taken Some
Actions to Expedite the Mine Plan Review Process but Could Do More 6-7
(2016).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A similar trend is visible in the Forest Service data. Only
projects in the 75th percentile of EISs took longer than four
years.\14\ Because there were only 870 EISs total, that means roughly
217 documents took longer than four years over 16 years. In contrast,
at least 28,552 decisions were made in less than 1.2 years.\15\ In
other words, efficiency is possible, and it happens. It is also
important to keep the big picture in focus. The commonly cited
statistic that permits take six years represents less than 1% of all
NEPA decisions.

NEPA supra note 3 at 297.
\15\ Id. at 289 and 297 (showing that there were 6,881 EAs, 50% of
which were completed in less than 1.2 years and there were 33,143 CEs,
at least 75% of which were completed in less than one year).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moreover, analytical rigor does not appear to be the primary cause
of delay.\16\ When we used a regression model to identify causes of
delay, we learned that NEPA specific factors could not predict whether
a project would encounter a delay.\17\ Instead, the most common causes
of delay were functional and external to the NEPA analysis. Those were:
(1) agency capacity, which includes both staff availability and
appropriate expertise; (2) delays attributable to the operator
including waiting for information, changed plans of operation, and
shifting priorities; and (3) compliance with other laws, which includes
coordination with other permitting authorities.\18\

\17\ Id. at 300-306.
\18\ Id. at 306-322.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notably, both the GAO and the National Research Council made the
same observations regarding delays in the mine permit application
process.\19\ Three prominent causes of delay were: (1) insufficient
resources, including staff, expertise, funding, or technology; (2)
waiting for operator responses following vague applications or changes
to a mine plan; and (3) compliance with other legal standards and/or
ineffective agency coordination during the mine plan review
process.\20\

\20\ See Pleune, Playing the Long Game supra note 8 at 10900-10906
(discussing these studies).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even permits that can be processed quickly are affected by these
factors. A 2014 investigation by the Office of Inspector General into
BLM permit processing times for oil and gas wells emphasizes this
point.\21\ The BLM receives approximately 5,000 new APDs each year,
which are processed at 33 different field offices. According to the
BLM, the average processing time in 2012 was 228 days, but this number
only tells part of the story. Even though each field office is governed
by the same legal standard, the permit processing times varied widely.
Buffalo, WY and Miles City, MT took more than 300 days to process
permits. In contrast, five field offices took less than 100 days.
Anchorage, AK averaged 37 days.

Onshore Oil and Gas Permitting, U.S. Dept. of Int., Report No. CR-EV-
MOA-0003-2013 (June 2014).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This dramatic variation in permit processing times cannot be blamed
on NEPA or environmental standards because each field office was
applying the same legal standard to the same activity. Sources of delay
were a lack of staff, poor data management, and weaknesses in oversight
and accountability.\22\ Even though BLM had repeatedly identified
staffing shortages as a problem, limited budgets combined with a high
cost of living made it difficult to attract and retain employees. Field
offices with staff shortages experienced prolonged review times. Permit
coordination and management also mattered. Most field offices did not
assign a manager to oversee the APD process, resulting in an open-ended
process where applications languished and no one could predict when the
application would be finished. Field offices that did assign field
managers processed permits in less than half the average time.\23\ In
other words, improving permit coordination resulted in faster permit
processing times.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\22\ Id. at 6.
\23\ The Field Office in Silt, CO which uses supervisors, averaged
108 days in FY2012 versus the bureau wide average of 228 days. The
field office in Carlsbad NM uses a field manager, as well as an in-
house automated tracking system. Its processing times average 110 days.
Id. at 7.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The consistency of these findings across time, agencies, and
practice constitute reliable evidence as to the real causes of delay in
permit processing. These delays can be summarized as: (1) agency
capacity; (2) delays attributable to the operator; and (3) permitting
coordination. These findings demonstrate that the choice between speed
and environmental standards is a false dilemma. Each of the true
sources of delay can be addressed without compromising environmental
standards that protect safe, healthy, and clean communities.
IV. Permit Reform That Addresses the True Causes of Delay

We can improve permit processing times by bolstering agency
capacity, fostering early communication with permit applicants, and
improving permit coordination. Notably, improved communication and
better coordination depend on sufficient agency capacity. So the first
step for permit reform should be to focus on agency capacity.
1. Building Agency Capacity Requires Long-Term Funding and Strategic
Workforce Planning.

Wisely, Congress has already taken a step in the right direction.
The Inflation Reduction Act contained roughly $1 billion directed
toward improving agencies' environmental review processes and NEPA
implementation. These funds are a critical--and encouraging--first
step; however, the journey is not over. Agencies must rebuild from
chronic shortages. Additionally, the funding must be reliable and
sustained to allow agencies to implement strategic workforce plans,
retain experienced staff, and engage in proactive planning that can
facilitate faster decisionmaking. Finally, agencies must have
flexibility to spend the funds in the area of greatest need.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\24\ See Office of Inspector General, Department of the Interior,
Onshore Oil and Gas Permitting, U.S. Dept. of Int., Report No. CR-EV-
MOA-0003-2013, 10 (June 2014) (noting that Congress had allocated
funding to seven field offices as a pilot project for improving oil and
gas processing times through expanded capacity; however those field
offices no longer carried the heaviest workload due to shifting
development patterns and the act did not allow BLM to transfer the
special funding to offices with the greatest need).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many agencies that were already understaffed suffered extreme
losses of staff under the last Administration. The Bureau of Land
Management offers an instructive case study.\25\ Since 2011, it has
been on the GAO's list of programs at high risk and vulnerable to
waste, fraud and abuse due in part to a lack of staff. This problem was
further exacerbated in July 2020, when the last Administration abruptly
decided relocate BLM's headquarters from Washington D.C. to Grand
Junction, Colorado. The Headquarters Office, which develops guidance
and regulations, should be staffed by 311 career positions. However, it
was already severely understaffed with 132 vacant positions before the
relocation announcement. In response to the relocation announcement, 81
more staff left, leaving the leadership at 31 percent capacity. The
remaining leadership team were dispersed among multiple offices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\25\ This discussion draws heavily from the following article.
Jamie Pleune & Ted Boling, This Permit Reform Works. Why Aren't Mine
Projects Using It? 53 Envt'l L. Rep. ___ (forthcoming June 2023)
[hereinafter Pleune & Boling, This Permit Reform Works]. See also Gov't
Accountability Off., GAO-20-379R, Bureau of Land Management: Agency
Reorganization Efforts Did Not Substantially Address Key Practices for
Effective Reforms (Mar. 6, 2020) and Gov't Accountability Off., GAO-22-
104247, BLM, Better Workforce Planning and Data Would Help Mitigate the
Effects of Recent Staff Vacancies (Nov. 2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Numbers do not tell the whole story. The BLM also suffered a loss
of experienced staff. Every BLM staff member interviewed reported that
the loss of experienced staff negatively affected their offices'
ability to conduct its duties. For example, the loss of institutional
knowledge about laws and regulations meant that the BLM could not
provide knowledgeable input on proposed rules and legislation. Other
staff admitted that the rapid loss of experienced staff hindered
knowledge transfer. In a follow-up report, a year later, all BLM staff
interviewed by the GAO reported challenges in completing their duties
due to headquarters vacancies. As a result of delays in creating or
clarifying guidance or policies, some staff relied on outdated policy
guidance to make decisions. Other staff reported delays implementing
upgrades to information technology systems, which GAO had previously
recommended be updated. Obviously these institutional challenges would
affect permitting times. Applicants could not receive good guidance
from experienced staff, and staff members processing permits had little
instruction on how to proceed effectively. The BLM is not alone.
Multiple agencies with permitting or infrastructure responsibilities,
are short-staffed and underfunded.
Filling vacancies requires strategic workforce planning, but few
agencies have engaged in that process. When the GAO investigated the
BLM's workforce planning in 2020, it found that the BLM had no way of
tracking vacancies and no recruitment plan for filling vacancies.\26\
When asking for data on the total number of positions and vacancies
agency wide, the GAO was told that BLM does not maintain a list of
vacancies for state offices. As a result, it was not possible to
determine the proportion of positions that are vacant at any given time
or the specific positions that are vacant. This lack of information
obviously creates a problem for improving capacity in a way that
results in improved efficiency. Strategic workforce planning is
critical to ensuring that agencies spend wisely and build a workforce
capable of fulfilling agency missions. Additionally, agencies must be
confident that the funding will not disappear. Unstable budgets do not
build durable workforces.

Agency Reorganization Efforts Did Not Substantially Address Key
Practices for Effective Reforms GAO-20-379R, 10 (Mar. 6, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Pre-application meetings, early stakeholder engagement, permit
sequencing, and transparent schedules are proven methods for
improving efficiency without compromising environmental
standards or public participation.

With expanded capacity, agencies can address other sources of delay
such as communication with permit applicants, and interagency
coordination. The best practices and procedural requirements of FAST-41
target both problems and serve as a valuable test case for their
efficacy.\27\ Wisely, Congress has also appropriated funding to support

implement these practices.

Pre-application meetings with project proponents speed permitting
by avoiding delays later in the process.\28\ Meeting with regulators
and stakeholders early allows project sponsors to incorporate
environmental and social sensitivities at the design phase, when impact
avoidance is still feasible and cost-effective. Additionally, project
sponsors can benefit from agencies' experience with addressing
controversial or complex impacts in other similar projects. This
results in fewer modifications later in the process. It also reduces
permit review times by minimizing the amount of additional information
agencies must request during the review process. Especially in complex
areas with conflicting or overlapping jurisdictions, the analytical and
public comment procedures imposed by the NEPA process can actually
speed project approval by providing a framework for analysis and
bringing multiple permitting authorities to the table.

For example, the NEXUS Gas Transmission Project, was a 250-mile
natural gas pipeline traversing Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and
Michigan.\29\ During the pre-application process, which included
extensive public participation, the project sponsors incorporated 239
route alternatives and variations in the pipeline design to address
landowner requests, avoid sensitive resources, or respond to
engineering restraints. This feedback resulted in a 91 percent change
from the original proposed route design--a number of modifications that
would have been prohibitively expensive at the end of the review
process. Using this information at the beginning of the process
improved efficiency and arguably resulted in a better end-result and a
final application that was processed more expeditiously.\30\

opposition in three Ohio towns).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early stakeholder engagement is also consistent with the results of
recent research conducted by MIT investigating sources of delay for
renewable energy projects.\31\ Two critical sources of delay were
opposition from affected landowners due to real or perceived harms that
the project would bring, and inconsistency between overlapping
authorities, such as local, state, tribal, and federal jurisdictions.
Based on their empirical research, they concluded that ``incorporating
all stakeholder perspectives from the outset of a siting process will
probably save time and money.'' \32\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is not to say that early stakeholder engagement will eliminate
all opposition. The NEXUS Gas Transmission Project demonstrates a
conundrum with finding permitting success stories. The ideal result of
implementing a best practice, like pre-application meetings, is the
avoidance of a bad result, like project delays from unexpected impacts
or local opposition. If the best practice works, the bad result will
not occur. Which means that that a success story must prove a negative.
It makes sense intuitively that such substantial route alterations
would address many concerns and reduce opposition, but there is no way
to prove what would have happened if the pipeline design had proceeded
as originally designed. Moreover, the absence of opposition is an
unrealistic standard to demonstrate success. With large projects, like
the NEXUS Transmission Gas Line, it would be virtually impossible to
avoid all opposition.\33\ Thus, recognizing success requires enough
familiarity with the process to understand what could have happened in
a given scenario.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\33\ Gorovitz, Cities and Towns Seethe supra note 30 at 907-934
(detailing some local opposition to the pipeline).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAST-41 procedures also focus heavily on avoiding delays caused by
poor inter-agency coordination.\34\ In early stakeholder meetings,
agencies develop a Coordinated Project Plan that encourages the
development of concurrent, rather than sequential, analyses. Early and
coordinated stakeholder engagement enhances the efficiency of this
process. The Permitting Dashboard creates accountability, reducing the
likelihood that a decision will linger on the back of someone's desk.
Finally, enhanced oversight from the Executive Director of the
Permitting Council creates an opportunity for conflicts between
jurisdictions to be addressed early, and in a coordinated manner. The
Permitting Council's 2020 Annual Report to Congress offered both
quantitative and qualitative evidence of the program's success. Between
2010 and 2018, the average time across all agencies for a project to
complete an EIS was 4.5 years. In contrast, the average time to
complete an EIS for projects that went through the FAST-41 process by
2020 was 2.5 years. Perhaps more persuasively, the report included
testimonials from project proponents praising the transparency and
efficiency of the process.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\34\ For a thorough discussion of these issues, see Pleune &
Boling, This Permit Reform Works supra note 25.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A GAO investigation, also found evidence of the program's success
that extended beyond federal agencies.\35\ Although FAST-41 only
directly affects federal agencies, the opportunities for coordination
extend to state, local, and tribal permitting authorities. Early
engagement creates opportunities for permitting authorities to enter
into Memorandums of Understanding establishing roles and
responsibilities As an example, the GAO report discussed the Mid-
Barataria Sediment Diversion project, which was a complex FAST-41
project focused on restoring ecosystems damaged by coastal erosion and
the Deepwater Horizon Oil spill, which oiled over 684 miles of wetlands
across the Gulf of Mexico, particularly in the Barataria Bay.\36\ With
the Army Corps of Engineers as lead agency, six federal agencies
entered into a memorandum of understanding with several Louisiana state
agencies, accelerating the environmental review and permitting process
by nearly two years.\37\ Due to the complexity of this project, many
project participants believe that it would not have been possible
without the coordination procedures afforded through the FAST-41
process. The GAO attributed this efficiency to enhanced interagency
coordination.\38\ In summary, efficient permitting is possible without
compromising environmental standards.

V. Renewable Energy Projects Face Permitting Delays Unrelated to
Environmental Standards Due to Serious Problems with the
Interconnect Queue and Regional Transmission Organizations

A recent study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found
that there are over 2,000 GW of total generation and storage capacity
waiting for approval to connect to the grid, 95 percent of which are
solar, wind, or battery storage.\39\ The combined wind and solar
capacity actively seeking connection to the grid is approximately 1,250
GW, which is roughly equal to the current installed capacity of the
entire U.S. power plant fleet and consistent with what is necessary to
achieve the 2030 target.\40\

\40\ Id.; see also Emma Penrod, Why the Energy Transition Broke the
U.S. Interconnection System Utility Dive (Aug. 22, 2022) (quoting
Bhaskar Ray, vice president of interconnection and development
engineering for energy developer Qcells USA as estimating that if all
the capacity currently waiting in the interconnection queue today were
built by 2030, the U.S. would meet the 80% clean energy share
milestone).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The hurdles facing these projects involve issues with the
interconnect queue, regional control of transmission, and a lack of
high power transmission lines. The wait time for projects in the
interconnect queue is steadily rising.\41\ Between 2000-2007, the time
between an initial connection request and a fully built, operational
plant was typically less than two years. Between 2018-2022, that
timeframe doubled to an average of almost 4 years, with an increasing
trend. By 2022, the median time between an interconnection request to
commercial operations date reached almost 5 years.\42\ The increased
volume of proposed renewable projects sitting in the queue promises to
continue amplifying this problem. For example, at least two regional
transmission organizations, the entities responsible for approving
requests to connect to the grid, have announced pauses on accepting new
projects until they can process their backlogs. The nation's largest
electric grid operator, PJM Interconnection, coordinates electricity
movement in 13 states and the District of Columbia.\43\ It has
announced that it will not process any new applications until the end
of 2025.\44\ Similarly, CAISO,\45\ a California grid operator, declined
to accept any new projects in 2022 while they processed their backlog.
Both entities are looking for systemic solutions to improve the grid
connection process. The interconnect queue, regional control of
transmission, and a lack of high power transmission lines are serious
problems delaying implementation of green technology. These problems
are worthy of permit reform and require Congressional attention.
Strengthening federal authority to facilitate interstate transmission
power transmission may be one solution. Regardless of the solution to
these complex problems, delays caused by the interconnect queue should
not be conflated with NEPA and environmental standards.

VI. Good Decisions Are More Important Than Rushed Decisions

The discussion around permit reform often focuses exclusively on
decisionmaking times. A legitimate sense of urgency to implement clean
energy projects drives many to seek shortcuts. However, rushed
decisions have consequences. For example, the GAO recently investigated
the Department of Energy's management of $1.1 billion in funding for
carbon capture sequestration projects.\46\ It found that between 2009
to 2022, the DOE provided $684 million to eight coal projects. Every
project went over budget and exceeded timelines. Only one project went
into operation, and even that project eventually shut down because it
was not economically viable. In summary, none of the projects
succeeded.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\46\ Gov't Accountability Off., GAO-22-105111, Carbon Capture and
Storage: Actions Needed to Improve DOE Management of Demonstration
Projects (Dec. 2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rushed decisionmaking contributed to the DOE's poor judgment and
money management, according to the GAO. Eager to spend funding from the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the DOE bypassed its
usual selection procedures and committed to coal projects at their
initial selection. Additionally, DOE used expedited timeframes for
project negotiations--shortening them from one year to three months.
Bypassing procedures reduced DOE's ability to identify and mitigate
risks, resulting in a $684 million loss for the American people.
Like mismanaged money, environmental resources, communities, and
human health are not replaceable. The BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill
offers a cautionary tale against expediting permitting by eliminating
analytical rigor and environmental analysis.\47\ The Macondo well never
underwent NEPA's hard look requirement due to a broad categorical
exclusion.\48\ Additionally, staff within the managing agencies were
subject to 30-day deadlines and instructed to approve permits as
quickly as possible, without creating unnecessary delays.\49\
Furthermore the industry had grown more quickly than the agency,
resulting in a offices that were short-staffed and lacked training or
expertise to understand the implications of the technology being
used.\50\

\50\ Id. at 73-74.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to NEPA streamlining procedures, short review deadlines, and
insufficient agency capacity, risks that might have been exposed
through the NEPA process went undetected. For example, BP's emergency
response plan for a subsea blow-out was to drill a relief well.\51\
When this became the only option for containing the spill, BP revealed
that drilling the relief well would take at least three months.
Meanwhile, the spill kept gushing over 50,000 barrels of oil per day
into the Gulf.\52\ This risk should have been caught by agency staff at
the permitting stage, but it wasn't. Because the permit was not subject
to public comment or circulated to other agencies, no one else saw it
either. We cannot know if a more rigorous permitting process would have
avoided the spill. But we can learn from the past.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good decisions are more important than rushed decisions. Many
reform proponents emphasize statutory exemptions for favored projects,
expanding the use of categorical exclusions, imposing short deadlines
and page limits, restricting public comment opportunities, and reducing
the rigor of environmental analysis.\53\ As the Deepwater Horizon
example demonstrates, these reform proposals are likely to
underestimate risks and overlook problems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
VII. Conclusion

Despite its ubiquity, the phrase ``permit reform'' is misleading.
There is no single ``permit law'' that can be amended to eradicate
delays. Complex projects, like transmission lines, mine permits, and
renewable energy projects implicate a variety of legal standards and
permitting authorities, each focused on protecting different resources
such as clean air, clean water, endangered species, and cultural
resources.
Used properly, the NEPA process can facilitate coordinated
information gathering and decisionmaking and streamline the permitting
process. Improved inter-agency coordination, shared data management,
and strategic permit sequencing facilitate concurrent review between
permitting authorities. Enhanced communication with the project
sponsor, implementation of permitting best practices, and greater
accountability for permitting authorities avoid inefficient delays.
Early stakeholder engagement creates an opportunity to identify, avoid,
and mitigate harms at the most cost-effective phase of a project's life
cycle. All of these improvements depend on robust agency capacity.
These reforms are not easily encapsulated in a pithy soundbite, but
they do address the true causes of delay in permitting without
compromising environmental or safety standards.

Questions Submitted for the Record to Professor Jamie Pleune,
University of Utah, S.J. Quinney College of Law
Questions Submitted by Representative Westerman
Question 1. Can you explain how Congress can modernize and clarify
the CEQ regulations to facilitate more efficient, effective, and timely
NEPA reviews by Federal agencies by simplifying regulatory
requirements, codifying certain guidance and caselaw relevant to those
proposed regulations, revising the regulations to reflect current
technologies and agency practices, eliminating obsolete provisions, and
improving the format and readability of the regulations?

Answer. There has been intense focus on revising CEQ's NEPA
regulations and codifying certain changes to NEPA in order to improve
decisionmaking timelines. In addition to CEQ's ongoing efforts to
revise its NEPA implementing regulations,\1\ each agency also has its
own implementing regulations tailored to the practices and challenges
of implementing NEPA within the context of work accomplished by each
agency.\2\ While there may be some regulatory provisions that merit
revision, research suggests that the regulatory requirements of NEPA
are only a small factor in the variation between decisionmaking times.
External factors such as agency capacity, budgets, technology, project
management, compliance with other laws, changes to the scope of the
project, and litigation aversion appear to have a heavier influence on
efficient and timely NEPA reviews.\3\

Rather than focusing on regulatory changes that reduce analytical
rigor and environmental protections without offering a substantive
benefit, a more productive approach to improving NEPA efficiency would
focus on improving agency capacity, promoting strategically-sized
analyses for long-term efficiency, using NEPA as a framework for
structured inter-agency (and inter-governmental) collaboration, and
utilizing the NEPA process to develop consensus.\4\ The procedures
adopted through FAST-41 appear to improve predictability, transparency
and timeliness for complex projects.\5\

Additional promising practices have been publicized in the annual
Best Practices Reports issued by the Federal Permitting Improvement
Steering Council.\6\ The early iterations of these reports (2017 &
2018) were particularly creative and identified specific practices that
had been implemented by different agencies with positive results for
efficiency. Many of the best practices identified in these reports
could be replicated to improve efficiency across agencies. For example,
the Army Corps of Engineers improved its web-based application for a
general permit, including creating an online permit application, with a
video tutorial on how to fill it out, and specific contact information
for assistance. This reduced the frequency of incomplete or inaccurate
applications, which reduced processing times. It also freed up staff
members to focus on more complex permits.\7\ These reports identify
manageable, affordable, and replicable practices that improve
efficiency. Unfortunately, later iterations of the best practices
report focus less on success stories. In particular, the format adopted
in 2022, which requires a Quarterly Agency Performance Report, imposes
an additional workload on the Permitting Council and agencies without
providing the same overview of creative measures adopted by different
agencies that test improved practices and assess their value.

Question 2. Yes or No--the study on NEPA implementation you co-
authored, Evidence-Based Recommendations for Improving National
Environmental Policy Act Implementation, only analyzed NEPA decisions
completed by the U.S. Forest Service. If yes, please explain the limits
of extrapolating data and conclusions from a study on one government
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
agency and applying those conclusions to other government agencies.

Answer. Yes. The article, Evidence-Based Recommendations for
Improving National Environmental Policy Act Implementation, used a
database of NEPA decisions issued by the U.S. Forest Service. To our
knowledge, the Multi-Year Trend Report database compiled by the Forest
Service is the most comprehensive, detailed, and reliable set of data
regarding NEPA decisions gathered by any agency.\8\ It would be
valuable for other agencies to develop similar databases in order to
compare practices.\9\ The MYTR database also has limitations. It was
designed as a tracking system to facilitate compliance with public
disclosure duties.\10\ The information that it contains is specific to
NEPA decision documents, which are distinct from the time required to
implement a project following its approval. Additionally, the database
does not track when work on a NEPA decision document is paused due to
changes in the scope of the project, political priorities, or budgetary
limitations. Finally, the MYTR database offers information regarding
decisionmaking times, but it does not provide a way to test whether the
NEPA process produces better projects through the twin aims of
meaningful public engagement and careful consideration of environmental
impacts. Valuable information about avoided impacts, improved time to
implementation, and reduction of community opposition to a project are
not visible in this database.

Despite these limitations, there are two reasons to believe that
the information we obtained regarding Forest Service NEPA practice is
informative for the practices of other agencies. First, the Forest
Service conducts more EISs than any other agency.\11\ Second, when we
turned our attention to the mine permitting process, multiple reports
identified the same underlying causes of delay in the mine permitting
process that we observed in the Forest Service's NEPA practices.\12\
For these reasons, we believe that the information regarding Forest
Service practice is informative, even if it is not perfect.

Question 3. The study you co-authored on NEPA implementation in the
U.S. Forest Service, Evidence-Based Recommendations for Improving
National Environmental Policy Act Implementation, found that the
administrative region had a ``significant influence'' on decision-
making times. Can you explain the regional differences that affected
the variation in completion times and why further research is necessary
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
to explain the regional differences in decision-making times?

Answer. The regression model revealed that the Forest Service
administrative region responsible for overseeing a NEPA analysis has a
significant influence on decisionmaking times. This finding surprised
use because each Forest Service region is implementing the same laws,
subject to the same regulations, pursuant to the same administrative
guidance, involving the same activities. If delays in decisionmaking
times were caused solely by the NEPA process, we would expect similar
mean completion times across regions. The regional variation suggests
that factors external to the NEPA process was affecting decisionmaking
times. We posited some potential influences including ecological
differences, cultural differences, and different budgetary structures.
However, these were simply ideas. We have no way to test these
hypotheses, which is why further research is necessary. Understanding
why some regions complete the NEPA process more quickly may reveal
administrative and management efficiencies that could be replicated.
Conversely, understanding why some regions tend toward slower decisions
could identify barriers to efficiency that can be eliminated.

Question 4. Regarding the study you co-authored on NEPA
implementation in the U.S. Forest Service, Evidence-Based
Recommendations for Improving National Environmental Policy Act
Implementation, can you explain the correlation between regional
decision-making time and wildfire suppression costs?

Answer. Throughout our study period, fire borrowing affected the
staff and resources available to complete NEPA projects and thereby
increased NEPA compliance times.\13\ Additionally, the uncertainty
caused by wildfire suppression activities was identified by Forest
Service staff and stakeholders as a cause of delay that complicated
NEPA compliance.\14\ Sources of delay included unstable budgets as well
as staff reductions and shifting staff from project management to
wildfire duties.\15\ Additionally, according to a 2006 report by the
Office of Inspector General, some regions bore an ``inequitable
wildfire protection burden'' because wildland fire protection
agreements between the Forest Service and other agencies had not been
renegotiated to reflect appropriate WUI protection
responsibilities.\16\ Finally, due to ecological differences, some
regions have higher wildfire hazards than others. There appeared to be
some correlation between regions with longer decisionmaking times and
those with greater wildfire burdens. However, other than observing the
overlap, we had no way to test the relationship. It is worth noting
Congress stabilized funding for wildfire suppression costs in 2018.
However, the effect of this legislation was not visible during the
period of study for our research.\17\ This could be a productive area
of study.

Question 5. Would additional resources for wildfire management help
reduce NEPA decision-making times [for] areas with higher wildfire
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
suppression costs?

Answer. According to a 2019 report from the Congressional Research
Service, ``Fire expenditures continue to climb, affecting the
implementation of other programs . . . through personnel and funds
transferred to fire control.'' \18\ A series of roundtables conducted
with stakeholders engaged with the Forest Service NEPA process also
described how the high priority of wildfire suppression activities
affect decisionmaking times. ``Budget shortfalls and statutory mandates
on funding for fire response, combined with a shortage of trained
employees in areas other than fire and/or a frequent diversion of staff
to emergency response or shifting priorities, hamper the ability of the
Agency to make progress on other important forest and grassland
resource management efforts.'' They also noted that ``staffing levels
are not adequate to meet the current demand'' and that ``timelines are
often lengthened due to the need for hiring or onboarding additional
staff, including `holes' in interdisciplinary team specialist
representation'' \19\ Based on these reports, it appears likely that
stabilizing budgets and bolstering agency capacity in non-fire
suppression roles would improve decisionmaking times and efficiency in
the NEPA process.

Question 6. Can you provide more information on how America needs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
permitting reform for transmission lines?

Answer. A recent study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
found that there are over 2,000 GW of total generation and storage
capacity waiting for approval to connect to the grid, 95 percent of
which are solar, wind, or battery storage.\20\ However, these projects
face long wait times and uncertainty when attempting to connect to the
grid. Between 2000-2007, the time between an initial connection request
and a fully built, operational plant was typically less than 2 years.
Between 2018-2022, that timeframe doubled to an average of almost 4
years, with an increasing trend. By 2022, the median between an
interconnection request to commercial operations date reached almost 5
years. The increased volume of proposed renewable projects sitting in
the queue promises to amplify this problem. For example, at least two
regional transmission organizations, the entities responsible for
approving requests to connect to the grid, have announced pauses on
accepting new projects until they can process their backlogs. The
nation's largest electric grid operator, PJM Interconnection,
coordinates electricity movement in 13 states and the District of
Columbia.\21\ It has announced that it will not process any new
applications until the end of 2025.\22\ Similarly, CAISO,\23\ a
California grid operator, declined to accept any new projects in 2022
while they processed their backlog. Both entities are looking for
systemic solutions to improve the grid connection process. In addition
to these challenges, transmission lines also face siting challenges,
especially within communities that do not benefit from the power line.
The interconnect queue, regional control of transmission, and siting
high power transmission lines are serious problems that deserve a
national strategy and are worthy of permit reform.

Question 7. How would having a lead federal agency for permitting
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
benefit getting more energy projects up and running.

Answer. Experience within the FAST-41 program demonstrates that
identifying a lead federal agency and tasking it with the
responsibility to convene stakeholders early in the permitting process
can improve the transparency, predictability, and timeliness of
permitting.\24\ Tasking a lead agency with the responsibility for
coordinating multiple different permitting authorities, sequencing
permitting decisions, identifying information that must be gathered,
developing data management protocols, and coordinating stakeholder
engagement can promote efficiency. For example, the Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA) utilized the NEPA process to overcome the
challenge of inter-agency variance in decisionmaking for multiple
federal, state, and local entities affected by a proposal to improve
intercity passenger rail service in the Northeast Corridor.\25\ By
engaging multiple agencies early, and identifying points of contact
within each agency, the FRA ensured that partner agencies could provide
timely information that the technical team utilized, avoiding conflict
down the road. Communication protocols enabled the creation of an
interactive dataset encompassing multiple local and state
jurisdictions, transportation authorities and watersheds that could be
used for subsequent environmental analyses. This created a framework
for collaboration that would foster continued efficiencies beyond
project implementation because future projects can utilize the
established inter-jurisdictional database and communication protocols.

Question 8. Can you further explain permitting delays caused by
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
litigation aversion of agency staff?

Answer. In 2018, the Forest Service launched an agency-wide effort
to improve processes related to Environmental Analysis and Decision
Making (EADM).\26\ The acronym EADM includes the NEPA processes, as
well as underlying environmental decisions such as forest planning,
issuance of special use permits, implementation of forest management
activities, and fulfilment of other statutory obligations, including
compliance with the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and
the National Historic Preservation Act. As part of that effort, the
Forest Service asked the National Forest Foundation to assist in
hosting ten regional partner roundtables across the country with the
objective of collecting diverse feedback to inform ways to improve
decisionmaking processes. During the roundtables, concern over
litigation aversion featured prominently in every region.\27\ According
to participants in the roundtables, Forest Service staff avoid making
controversial decisions for fear of affecting opportunities for
promotion.\28\ A controversial decision may sit on the back of
someone's desk until that person is promoted or sent on detail, leaving
someone else to bear the political or professional backlash of signing
a decision that gets litigated. Additionally, litigation aversion leads
to unwieldy, bulky, time-consuming documents. Participants in the
roundtables explained, ``Risk aversion and a history of legal
challenges to USFS decisions have led to the `bullet-proofing of
environmental analysis documents and specialist reports'' resulting in
documents where ``the complexity and size of analysis is often
inconsistent with the complexity and size of the project.'' \29\ These
observations are consistent with external research on Forest Service
NEPA practice, which found that the threat of litigation had more
influence on the decision to prepare an EIS or an EA than the degree of
environmental impacts.\30\ Practitioners also recognize the problem. As
one observed, ``[i]t has been the author's frequent experience that BLM
and Forest Service delay decision-making in order to prepare more and
lengthier documents in an effort to bulletproof their decisions from
appeal. As a result, the diversion of agency resources and attention to
the preparation of up-front disclosures under NEPA means less attention
and resources are devoted to on the ground efforts such as monitoring
the effects of agency decisions.'' \31\ Helen Leanne Serassio, a lawyer
with more than 14 years in the Department of Transportation, suggested
that ``the most effective action agencies can take to increase
efficiencies in the NEPA review process is to get back to the basics
with NEPA and halt efforts to make NEPA documents litigation-proof.''

Litigation aversion, which is a cultural problem that affects an
untold number of decisions, is different from delays caused by actual
litigation. Government-wide, only about two-tenths of one percent of
more than 50,000 NEPA decisions that are documented each year result in
litigation.\33\ An investigation by the GAO regarding Forest Service
fuel reduction projects from fiscal years 2006-2008 revealed that only
29 out of 1,415 decisions were litigated and the litigation impacted
only 1% of lands slated for fuel reduction projects.\34\ In summary,
the fear of litigation appears to create far more delay than litigation
itself.

Question 9. How can litigation reform reduce delays caused by
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
litigation aversion by agency staff?

Answer. According to participants in the EADM roundtable
discussions, Forest Service staff fear that their opportunities for
promotion will be reduced if they sign a NEPA decision that is
litigated.\35\ Assuming the accuracy of these reports, the best way to
reduce delays caused by litigation aversion is to reward agency
officials who make prompt, well-supported decisions, regardless of
whether the decision is litigated. This shift in focus would enable
agencies like the Forest Service to encourage field officers to act
decisively and exercise discretion to focus the NEPA analysis on
significant issues identified during the scoping process.\36\ As Helen
Leanne Serassio observed, ``Agencies must recognize and use their
discretion to determine the necessary length of their NEPA documents,
the methodologies to use, and the depth of the analysis necessary to
make an informed decision. . . . If the agency's decision is not
`arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in
accordance with law,' it will withstand judicial review.'' \37\ It is
also worth noting that the NEPA process itself can help an agency avoid
litigation by addressing stakeholder concerns through impact avoidance,
reduction or mitigation.\38\ It can also help ensure that a contentious
agency decision is defensible. Through NEPA's public participation
procedures, the agency has an early opportunity to identify issues that
may be litigated and justify its decisions regarding those issues.
``Courts do not typically overturn NEPA decisions when the
administrative record demonstrates that the agency has followed NEPA's
procedural steps, when there are minor deficiencies in the NEPA
document, or when an agency documents why it has chosen to exclude
information.'' \39\ Without the public participation process afforded
through NEPA, an agency may not understand the weaknesses in its
decision until it is too late. Finally, eliminating a cause of action
under NEPA will not protect a weak or unjustified agency decision from
litigation. A study analyzing 20 years of Forest Service land
management litigation recognized that most lawsuits involve multiple
claims arising under different statutes.\40\ In cases involving
multiple statutes, the majority of the time, the Forest Service would
have lost even if NEPA did not exist.\41\ The importance of this
observation comes into sharper focus when one considers the
proliferation of local, regional, and state regulations that can also
provide a cause of action to challenge a controversial action.

Question 10. Yes or no--do you agree that the Biden administration
push to electric vehicles, and other so-called ``clean energy''
technologies, will require an increase in mineral production, i.e.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
mining?

Answer. Yes. According to the Biden Administration's Report,
Building Resilient Supply Chains, Revitalizing American Manufacturing,
and Fostering Broad-Based Growth, demand for critical minerals and
materials ``is projected to surge over the next two decades,
particularly as the world moves to eliminate net carbon emissions by
2050.'' \42\ The report provided the following examples, ``global
demand for lithium and graphite, two of the most important materials
for electric vehicle batteries, is estimated to grow by more than 4000
percent by 2040 in a scenario where the world achieves its climate
goals.''

Answer. Yes. On May 10, 2023, the Biden Administration identified
several steps ``to expand and accelerate responsible domestic
production of critical minerals in a manner that upholds strong
environmental, labor, safety, Tribal consultation, and community
engagement standards.'' \44\ Promising reforms include updating the
General Mining Law and providing legal clarification for laws affecting
re-mining and remediation projects. These are two examples of arenas
where legal ambiguities caused by complexities in the law create
delay.\45\

Question 13. Yes or no--the main producers of critical minerals--
such as China, Congo, and Indonesia--don't have nearly the same
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
environmental standards on mining as the United States, correct?

Answer. I am not an expert on international environmental law.
Based on my limited knowledge, it appears that China, Congo, and
Indonesia have lower environmental standards. Other main producers,
including Canada and Australia, appear to have comparable environmental
regulatory regimes.

Question 14. Yes or no--the main producers of critical minerals--
such as China, Congo, and Indonesia--do not have as many protections
for human rights or labor as the United States, correct?

Answer. I am not an expert in international human rights or labor
practices. Based on my limited knowledge, it appears that China, Congo,
and Indonesia have fewer human rights protections. Other main
producers, including Canada and Australia, appear to have comparable
human rights and labor regimes.

Questions Submitted by Representative Grijalva

Question 1. Republicans are demanding 22% across-the-board cuts to
annual appropriations. How would cuts like those affect the speed of
permit processing, which they claim they are trying to improve?

Answer. Common causes of delay in the permitting process can be
summarised into three categories: (1) a lack of agency capacity, which
includes insufficient allocation of resources (e.g., number of staff,
staff expertise, funding, infrastructure, training, and or computer
technology); (2) waiting for information from an applicant,
particularly following a permit application that was vague or
incomplete, or following a change to a proposed plan; (3) compliance
with other legal requirements and/or ineffective agency coordination or
collaboration during the permitting process.\46\ Notably, these three
categories are not independent. The first category--agency capacity--
affects the other two. Without sufficient staff or expertise, an agency
cannot provide support or training to assist operators in submitting
complete applications with the required information. It is also
unlikely that they will effectively engage in proactive coordination.
Thus, a lack of agency capacity exacerbates the other two causes of
delay.

Question 2. What impact does Executive Order 14096, Revitalizing
Our Nation's Commitment to Environmental Justice for All, have on
energy independence?

Answer. Executive Order 14096 reduces the risk that we will repeat
mistakes of the past by failing to account for the disproportionate
impacts that often fall to minority, underrepresented, and socially or
economically deprived communities.

Question 3. Would extending or even expanding the use of fossil
fuels make us more competitive or less competitive when compared to
countries that are racing toward a renewable energy economy?

Answer. This is outside my area of expertise.

Question 4. Would extending or even expanding the use of fossil
fuels increase our national security or weaken it?

Answer. According to the Secretary of Defense, ``No country can
find lasting security without tackling the climate crisis.'' \47\
Expanding the use of fossil fuels will exacerbate the climate crisis
and consequently weaken our national security.

Force and Federal Chief Sustainability Officer (Oct. 2022).

Question 5. What is the connection between NEPA and energy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
independence?

Answer. One way to achieve energy independence is transitioning to
a renewable energy economy, which means building massive
infrastructure. It also will require cooperation between agencies with
different jurisdictional duties, states, local communities, and tribes.
Without a framework for coordinating analysis, considering stakeholder
input, identifying potential hazards, and avoiding, reducing, or
mitigating those impacts, this build out of infrastructure would be
practically impossible. One barrier to the deployment of renewable
energy projects is opposition from affected landowners due to real or
perceived harms that the project would bring, and inconsistency between
local, state, tribal, and federal laws.\48\ A research team from MIT
concluded ``incorporating all stakeholder perspectives from the outset
of a siting process will probably save time and money'' by addressing
concerns early and avoiding sustained political opposition. The NEPA
process is a familiar tool that can be used to engage stakeholders
early and streamline renewable energy deployment. The NEPA process also
serves as a tool for decisionmakers to defend justified decisions. It
offers a public process for deliberation. It helps decisionmakers
identify issues of concern. It provides a forum to justify use of
agency discretion. It provides a preview potential sources of conflict
and a mechanism for avoiding, reducing, or mitigating impacts. And it
helps agencies understand legal vulnerabilities of a decision before
it's made.

Energy Projects in the United States, 165 Energy Policy 112922 (2022).

Question 6. What would weakening NEPA mean for frontline
communities, communities that have historically borne a
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
disproportionate burden of environmental harms?

Answer. Weakening NEPA would harm these communities. NEPA's ``look
before you leap'' mandate requires agencies to disclose environmental
impacts, weigh alternatives, and consider public comment before
committing public resources to a course of action.\49\ Looking to the
past is highly relevant to the future. Prior to NEPA's enactment,
agencies were free to implement decisions without regard to the
collateral damage on communities or natural resources. For example, the
Federal Highway Act of 1956 initiated construction of the interstate
highway system.\50\ Focused on speedy implementation, the Department of
Transportation routed highways through low cost, low opposition lands,
which tended to be parks, historic sites, recreation areas, and working
class or low-income neighborhoods. As a result, low-income communities
were disproportionately harmed during the build out of the interstate
highway system. One example is a segment of I-95 that cut through an
innercity community outside of Miami, Florida. Overtown, known at the
time as the ``Harlem of the South,'' was a thriving black community.
The selected route for I-95 cut straight through the community, even
though a less destructive route along a nearby abandoned railroad
corridor was available.\51\ In a 2009 report, the Federal Highway
Administration acknowledged that the selected route ``had a disastrous
impact on the economic and social structure of the community'' with
lingering effects that to this day fuel anger, resentment, and distrust
toward the Department of Transportation.\52\ Many other communities
suffered similar fates due to one-sided planning focused on finding the
cheapest route, without regard to the collateral impacts. As one group
of scholars described, ``Take any major American city, and you're
likely to find a historically Black neighborhood demolished, gashed in
two, or cut off from the rest of the city by a highway.'' \53\ The
disclosure requirements imposed through NEPA were intended to avoid
similar ill-advised and harmful uses of federal power and funding. As
the nation considers how to build a new interstate energy
infrastructure system, the lessons of the past should serve as a
cautionary tale.

it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking

Question 7. Under the Trump administration, the Bureau of Land
Management lost significant numbers of experienced staff when they
tried to move the agency's headquarters out of D.C. While the Biden
administration has taken important steps to address the bureau's
workforce challenges. Based on your research, would you please explain
the expected impact of the Trump BLM relocation on permitting times,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
and why it is important to provide sufficient and stable funding.

Answer. The Bureau of Land Management is one of several agencies
that suffered extreme losses of staff under the prior
administration.\54\ Since 2011, it has been on the GAO's list of
programs at high risk and vulnerable to waste, fraud and abuse due in
part to a lack of staff. This problem was further exacerbated in July
2020, when the Trump Administration abruptly decided relocate BLM's
headquarters from Washington D.C. to Grand Junction, Colorado. The
Headquarters Office, which develops guidance and regulations, should be
staffed by 311 career positions. However, it was already severely
understaffed with 132 vacant positions before the relocation
announcement. In response to the relocation announcement, 81 more staff
left, leaving the leadership at 31 percent capacity. The remaining
leadership team were dispersed among multiple offices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accountability Off., GAO-22-104247, BLM, Better Workforce Planning and
Data Would Help Mitigate the Effects of Recent Staff Vacancies (Nov.
2021).

Numbers do not tell the whole story. The BLM also suffered a loss
of experienced staff. Every BLM staff member interviewed reported that
the loss of experienced staff negatively affected their offices'
ability to conduct its duties. For example, the loss of institutional
knowledge about laws and regulations meant that the BLM could not
provide knowledgeable input on proposed rules and legislation. Other
staff admitted that the rapid loss of experienced staff hindered
knowledge transfer. In a follow-up report, a year later, all BLM staff
interviewed by the GAO reported challenges in completing their duties
due to headquarters vacancies. As a result of delays in creating or
clarifying guidance or policies, some staff relied on outdated policy
guidance to make decisions. Other staff reported delays implementing
upgrades to information technology systems, which GAO had previously
recommended be updated. Obviously these institutional challenges would
affect permitting times. Applicants could not receive good guidance
from experienced staff, and staff members processing permits had little
instruction on how to proceed effectively. The BLM is not alone.
Multiple agencies with permitting or infrastructure responsibilities,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
are short-staffed and underfunded.

When the GAO investigated the BLM's workforce planning in 2020, it
found that the BLM had no way of tracking vacancies and no recruitment
plan for filling vacancies.\55\ When asking for data on the total
number of positions and vacancies agency wide, the GAO was told that
BLM does not maintain a list of vacancies for state offices. As a
result, it was not possible to determine the proportion of positions
that are vacant at any given time or the specific positions that are
vacant. This lack of information obviously creates a problem for
improving capacity in a way that results in improved efficiency.

\55\ Government Accountability Office, Bureau of Land Management:
Agency Reorganization Efforts Did Not Substantially Address Key
Practices for Effective Reforms GAO-20-379R, 10 (Mar. 6, 2020).

In order to resolve workforce challenges, agencies require stable
funding that will enable strategic workforce development. Additionally,
agencies must be confident that the funding will not disappear.
Unstable budgets do not build durable workforces. Shortchanging
agencies of staff and funding will cause delays in the permitting
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
process.

Question 8. You've talked about the importance of staff but have
emphasized that certain staff attributes are important as well. What do
we need to see in those staff, and how can we make that happen?

Answer. Strategic workforce planning is critical to ensuring that
agencies spend wisely and build a workforce capable of fulfilling
agency missions. The Army Corps of Engineers developed a comprehensive
strategic workforce plan in 2017 that demonstrates how this type of
planning can achieve long-term efficiencies at all levels of agency
operations.\56\ The Corps developed planning strategies to align human
capital with changing workloads and missions using real-time workforce
data for decision-making.\57\ For example, they initiated a Workload to
Workforce Assessment, which is an annual planning activity conducted by
workforce managers agency-wide to assess the capacity, competency, and
balance of the workforce to meet the projected workload in the next 1
to 3 years.\58\ Based on the results, managers prepare action plans to
address any potential workforce capacity, competency, or balance gaps.
They also created Civilian Workforce Dashboards, which are an
interactive online display that provide workforce managers at all
levels of the organization with direct access to the most current human
capital information for planning purposes.

with Additional Actions GAO-22-104053 (Dec. 2021).

\58\ Id. at 10.

The Corps also created a strategy to address all four stages of the
human capital life cycle. The recruiting stage involves sourcing and
acquiring top talent to accomplish current and future missions, shaping
the workforce to meet mission needs, and marketing missions to attract
the workforce of the future.\59\ The Corps human resources managers
created a talent acquisition team to support the recruitment program.
They also utilized tools to attract talent including direct-hire
authorities. Use of direct hire authorities reduced vacancy fill time
and allowed managers to quickly hire top talent.\60\ Additional tools
included policy guidance for managers to offer monetary and non-
monetary incentives as tools to attract and retain personnel.
Incentives include student loan repayment; recruitment, relocation,
retention, and enhanced retention incentives; credit for prior non-
federal work experience and certain military experience for determining
annual leave accrual rate; and superior qualifications appointment and
special needs pay-setting authority.\61\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The second stage of the workforce life cycle is the developing
stage, which focuses on ensuring a culture of continuous skill
improvement throughout the organization and fostering technical and
leader development.\62\ To address career development challenges, the
Corps provides career specific training, development, and mentoring
activities to its workforce. This includes job-related training, an
Emerging Leaders Program, and a Senior Leader Academy.\63\ In addition
to training new staff, the mentoring and leadership training programs
have the added benefit of preserving and passing along institutional
knowledge within the agency.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\62\ Id.
\63\ Id. at 14-15.

The final stage is the sustaining, or retention stage, which
focuses on preventing critical talent loss and improving organizational
performance by valuing and engaging employees at all levels. Some
strategies utilized at this stage include an online exit survey tool
for departing employees to capture the underlying causes of talent
loss. Some offices also implemented a ``stay survey'' to measure
employee engagement during their tenure as a proactive alternative to
surveying staff that are leaving. The Corps also utilizes the annual
Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey as a tool to make improvements. The
Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey is an existing tool with valuable
information about workforce problems. The Corp directs managers at all
levels to analyze the annual survey results for their workforce and
develop action plans to address areas of concerns. Since adopting this
strategy, survey response rates and scores have steadily risen. For
example, employees satisfied with the organization rose from 55 percent
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
in 2013 to 71 percent in 2019.

Using these strategies, the Corps has been able to determine
critical skills and competencies needed, and align its workforce to
those needs. One strategy is through employee performance reviews. The
missions of the Army and the Corps are incorporated into each
employee's performance plan and evaluation. Employee progress reviews
link back to the mission and goals of the organization. Managers
provide feedback and recommend training to assist the employee in
reaching individual goals.\64\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\64\ Id. at 31.

Another strategy is agency-wide Workload to Workforce Assessments,
which assess the status of the workforce--such as vacancy fill rates--
to forecast the ability to meet the future workload and the type and
experience level of employees that will be needed.\65\ Use of the

Question 9. What is the biggest barrier to renewable energy
transmission projects, and what is the evidence for that conclusion?

Answer. A recent study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
found that there are over 2,000 GW of total generation and storage
capacity waiting for approval to connect to the grid, 95 percent of
which are solar, wind, or battery storage.\67\ However, these projects
face long wait times and uncertainty when attempting to connect to the
grid. Between 2000-2007, the time between an initial connection request
and a fully built, operational plant was typically less than 2 years.
Between 2018-2022, that time frame doubled to an average of almost 4
years, with an increasing trend. By 2022, the median between an
interconnection request to commercial operations date reached almost 5
years. This is a major barrier to energy transmission. Additional
hurdles include siting challenges, and cost-benefit allocation for
transmission lines that pass through communities without offering a
benefit.

Question 10. My friends on the other side of the aisle have claimed
that litigation slows energy projects. What effect does NEPA have on
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
litigation of major energy projects?

Answer. The NEPA process creates an opportunity to discover and
mitigate concerns with a proposed project before finalizing an action,
which can often avoid litigation that could delay implementation of an
action.\68\ The NEPA process can also reduce costs by identifying
design problems before implementation of a project begins. A study
prepared for the Transportation Research Board emphasized this
potential benefit. ``Spending more monies during planning and design
will reduce the time and cost required for construction by avoiding
unforeseen conditions, reducing to a minimum design errors and
omissions, and developing schemes that will support the most efficient
approach to construction.'' \69\

during the [NEPA] scoping process, stakeholders may raise concerns late
in the process or through litigation . . . [and] some of those concerns
may require collecting additional baseline data that may have been
easily collected at the beginning of the permitting process'').

For example, the NEXUS Gas Transmission Project, was a 250-mile
natural gas pipeline traversing Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and
Michigan.\70\ During the pre-application process, which included
extensive public participation, the project sponsors incorporated 239
route alternatives and variations in the pipeline design to address
landowner requests, avoid sensitive resources, or respond to
engineering restraints. This feedback resulted in a 91 percent change
from the original proposed route design--a number of modifications that
would have been prohibitively expensive at the end of the review
process. Using this information at the beginning of the process
improved efficiency and arguably resulted in a better end-result and a
final application that was processed more expeditiously.\71\ Similar
efficiencies could be achieved with other major energy projects.

opposition in three Ohio towns).

The NEPA process can also provide a mechanism to build consensus,
which can reduce the risk of litigation. For example, in 2012, the
Forest Service completed the 4FRI EIS. The project goal was to restore
the ponderosa pine forest stretching across northern Arizona, while
reducing communities' exposure to wildfire threats, rehabilitating
ecosystems, and sustaining the forest industry operating in local
communities.\72\ The EIS analyzed the largest number of acres in Forest
Service history, stretching across four different national forests, for
restoration-based mechanical forest treatments. Despite its ambitious
scale, the EIS was completed more quickly than the average time frame
for EISs completed that year, and when it came time for implementation,
the Forest Service was not delayed by litigation. Using the NEPA
process as an opportunity for collaborative decisionmaking developed
consensus among diverse stakeholders that had long-term benefits and
ultimately sped up implementation of the project.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\72\ Ruple et al., Evidence-Based Recommendations for Improving
Implementation of NEPA supra note 20 at 338.

This brings up another important distinction. Although NEPA's
detractors often blame litigation for delay, the evidence shows that
litigation is rare. Government-wide, only an estimated 0.22% of NEPA
decisions are litigated.\73\ An investigation by the Government
Accountability Office regarding Forest Service fuel reduction projects
from fiscal years 2006-2008 revealed that only 29 out of 1,415
decisions were litigated, and litigation impacted only 1% of lands
slated for fuel reduction projects.\74\ In other words, used properly,
the NEPA process is more likely to avoid potential litigation than
cause it. Proposed reforms like short deadlines and page limits
threaten to undermine NEPA's capacity to serve as a flexible tool for
structured and transparent deliberation.

Dr. Gosar. I thank the gentlelady.
I now recognize Mr. Kenny Stein for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF KENNY STEIN, DIRECTOR OF POLICY, INSTITUTE FOR
ENERGY RESEARCH, WASHINGTON, DC

Mr. Stein. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to
testify at this hearing.
For nearly 50 years a constant over-riding concern of
United States energy policy was the shortage and scarcity of
oil and natural gas. Dependence on foreign oil was seen as a
national security crisis. Numerous half-baked policy ideas,
regulations, and subsidies were spawned to address this
perceived crisis, many of which survive to this day, continuing
to distort markets and increase energy costs: fuel efficiency
mandates, ethanol subsidies and mandates, solar and wind
subsidies, export controls, subsidies for domestic production.
All of this and more was done in the name of energy
independence and security, and all to little effect.
But today, we have just about achieved that long-sought-
after energy security. Since lows in the mid-2000s, the United
States has more than doubled domestic oil production, and
almost doubled natural gas production. In 2019, the United
States became a net exporter of petroleum. The United States
became a net exporter of natural gas in 2017, and the United
States is also a net exporter of coal and refined products. The
United States is the largest oil and natural gas producer in
the world.
This position has completely changed this country's energy
posture, making the United States the most energy secure that
it has been since at least the first half of the 20th century.
This success did not come from government. It took years of
experimenting with and perfecting hydraulic fracturing and
directional drilling. It took companies taking the risk of
investing in new areas and new formations and new depths with
no guarantees of success. It took government actually getting
out of the way of exporting LNG and crude oil, providing new
markets for U.S. production. And it needed a lack of Federal
Government hostility.
For all its environmental radicalism, the Obama
administration recognized the need for domestic energy
production. They somewhat reduced production on Federal lands
through policy interference, but mostly left production on
private and state lands to its own devices. In short, the many
decades of government interference intervention did not solve
the energy security problem; the private sector did when it was
allowed to escape from the help of the Federal Government.
But just as we have just about achieved this long-sought
energy security, the Biden administration has launched a full
spectrum assault on domestic energy production, trying to crush
production on Federal lands while looking to regulate non-
Federal production into oblivion, all while subsidizing
promoting energy sources whose inputs and supply chains are
controlled by China and Chinese state-owned companies. It is an
agenda to replace independence with dependence, and dependence
on one of the countries in the world most hostile to the United
States, no less.
The Administration has grasped for any lever it can to
pursue its promotion of Chinese energy and suppression of U.S.
energy. This includes many of the laws and regulations passed
over the decades attempting to address the old crisis of
scarcity, which the Administration is now seeking to repurpose
in often illegal ways to support the crusade to eliminate the
new abundance.
As just a few examples of the Administration's war on
domestic energy, the Administration is actively seeking to halt
oil and gas production on Federal lands by any means in direct
contravention of congressional intent; the Council on
Environmental Quality is writing new guidelines for the
National Environmental Policy Act designed to turn an already
burdensome NEPA process into a cudgel to crush domestic energy
production; the Administration has participated in numerous
sue-and-settle deals with environmental groups so that they can
use the settlements to prevent oil and gas production without
going through Congress or the normal regulatory process; in a
brazen and illegal move, the Administration, for the first time
in our history, has refused to finalize an offshore leasing
plan entirely; the Administration is attempting to use old fuel
efficiency mandates to mandate electric vehicles; and finally,
the Administration has, without statutory mandate from
Congress, sought to inject vague notions of environmental
justice into every decision-making process. This concept is not
scientific or measurable. It is entirely in the eye of the
beholder. It is simply a tool for arbitrarily halting
development that the Administration does not like.
These actions, and the hundreds of other additional and
related actions are cumulative. Every action making it harder
to produce energy domestically reduces the desire of companies
to invest domestically. Oil and gas production requires ongoing
investment just to keep production stable, much less increase
it. Reduced investment means reduced production down the line,
and that reduced production erodes our hard-won energy
security. It ends with the spectacle of the President of the
United States, leader of the world's largest oil-producing
country, going hat-in-hand to beg Saudi Arabia for more
production, or cowardly seeking to relax sanctions against one
of the most brutal regimes in the Americas to get more oil
supply from Venezuela.
U.S. oil production still has not reached the level seen at
the end of 2019, just before the start of the pandemic. That is
not because the oil isn't there or there isn't demand. It is
because the companies are concerned about making the
investments needed when there is a hostile Administration
willing to use any means to destroy their industry. These
investments then get made in other countries, with the United
States left having to import to meet our future needs.
The Biden administration's regulatory assault on domestic
energy is an assault on this nation's security and prosperity.
It is a dependence agenda that makes energy more expensive and
less available, while at the same time making our energy system
dependent on foreign supplies from China. That this is being
done by regulatory fiat using questionable authorities, or even
in direct conflict with laws passed by Congress is, frankly, a
crisis of our democratic system.
Thank you, and I look forward to taking your questions.

The administration has grasped for any lever it can in pursuit of
its promotion of Chinese energy and suppression of US energy. This
includes many of the laws and regulations passed over the decades
attempting to address the old crisis of scarcity, which the
administration is now seeking to repurpose, often in illegal ways, to
support their crusade to eliminate abundance.

To list just a few examples of the Biden administration's war on
domestic energy:

The administration is actively seeking to halt oil and gas
production on federal lands by any means, in direction
contravention of Congressional intent.

The Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) is writing new
guidelines for the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
designed to turn the already burdensome NEPA process into a
cudgel to crush domestic energy production.

The administration has participated in numerous sue-and-
settle deals with environmental groups so they can use the

efficiency mandates to mandate electric vehicles.

And the administration has, without statutory mandate from

______

Dr. Gosar. Thank you, Mr. Stein. I thank all the witnesses
for your testimony. I will now recognize Members for 5 minutes
for their questions. I am going to start with the Chairman for
the Full Committee, Mr. Westerman.

Mr. Westerman. Thank you again, Chairman Gosar, and thank
you to the witnesses for being here today.
Ms. Pleune, you made a pretty solid argument about the
efficiency of NEPA. And if I understand from your testimony,
your position would be that NEPA is OK like it is, and it
doesn't need any reforms. Is that correct?
Ms. Pleune. NEPA is capable of efficiency, and it is done
efficiently under the existing regulations. However,
inefficiency also happens. What we found, however, is that the
sources of inefficiency are not the regulatory problems. If
they were, then we wouldn't see quick decisions.
In fact, what we are finding is that the primary sources of
inefficiency are a lack of staff capacity, a lack of regulatory
people with relevant expertise in order to make a decision. I
will just give you a quick example.
Mr. Westerman. I have some more questions.
Ms. Pleune. OK.
Mr. Westerman. Did you see any changes in the data when
administrations would change, where maybe permits were issued
quicker under one administration than another administration?
Ms. Pleune. We looked for that trend, and we did not see
that trend. But one, I think, really poignant example was a
study that the GAO did of application for permit-to-drill
processing times. And what they found is that, even though the
different field offices had significantly different times in
processing them, ranging from 300 days in Miles City to 37 days
in Anchorage--exact same standard, exact same law--and the
difference was a lack of capacity and how well the permitting
process was managed.
Mr. Westerman. Has that process increased since the--I
think it was in the IRA, or maybe the Infrastructure and Jobs
Act--there was a huge amount of money put out for agencies for
permitting. Have you seen any change in the numbers since there
has been a flood of money into the agencies?
Ms. Pleune. We have. And in fact, one of the things that is
showing quite significant improvements in permit processing
times are the reforms, and also the attention and support that
has been given to projects that are going through the FAST-41
process. And those improved processing times are quite
remarkable, first because the projects that go through FAST-41
are chosen because they are complex, they involve multiple
agencies, lots of different laws, and the permit processing
times within there are much shorter.
For example, in 2020, the average time for projects that
went through FAST-41 was about 2.5 years for EISs. Other
projects are going even more quickly, notably----
Mr. Westerman. Having done engineering work before I came
to Congress, when I hear 2.8 years or 2.5 years, that causes
people real problems that are actually trying to do projects,
to have it delayed that long where you are waiting for
permitting. Plus, it is not just NEPA. If you are building
something, you end up with clean air permits, water discharge
permits. So, these permits get stacked on top of each other.
But my real question here is, do you think that permitting
reform is necessary for America to meet the Administration's
clean energy goals?
Ms. Pleune. There are things that need to be reformed, and
some examples are the interconnect queue, the process for
approving transmission lines. The interconnect queue--right now
projects are waiting an average of 5 years because it is so
long to get through the regional transmission organizations.
Mr. Westerman. Is there anything in H.R. 1, the Lower
Energy Costs Act that we proposed on permitting reform, such as
putting one Federal agency in charge, limiting the length of
the permit applications, would any of that be beneficial, or do
you think that is just some kind of political gamesmanship?
Ms. Pleune. Identifying a lead Federal agency is a
productive practice that was implemented through the FAST-41
Act, and it does work.
You have multiple different permits that you have to
obtain, and the NEPA structure can provide a way for agencies
to coordinate that decision-making process, and that is what
they use the FAST-41 for.
Imposing time limits on NEPA process creates a possibility
that you won't be able to use the process in order to address
all of those different permits, especially where there are also
state, local, or tribal interests or permit requirements
imposed.
Mr. Westerman. You think there is any problem with
litigation on NEPA, litigation that may not be justified, that
it is used for more political purposes than to actually achieve
the objectives of NEPA?
Ms. Pleune. I think there are two elements of litigation
that are important to recognize. The first is that the amount
of litigation is extremely small. It is an estimated 0.22
percent of all NEPA decisions, and secondly, I don't think NEPA
litigation itself slows down very many projects.
However, there is a distinction between delays that are
caused by litigation and delays that are caused by litigation
aversion. In our research, we found that agency staff members
are concerned that their opportunities for promotion will be
limited if they sign a document that gets litigated. As a
result, the document sits on the back of the desk. It doesn't
get signed until that person gets promoted or they go on
detail. And that is a real significant delay that doesn't
benefit anyone.
So, creating a system where we reward agency members for
quick decisions, even if they are litigated, would be one way
to avoid delays that are caused by the fear of litigation.
Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I am out of time, even
though this is a fun discussion. Thank you.
Dr. Gosar. It was a fun discussion. Thank you, Chairman.
I now recognize Mrs. Lee from Nevada.
Mrs. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I want to thank all of the
witnesses today.
This hearing today can feel like it is tailor-made to
highlight the disagreements that those of us on this dais have
had and continue to have regarding energy policy. But I always
try to highlight areas where we can be in agreement. And I will
begin by asking you all a simple yes-or-no question.
Would you agree that, as a general rule, Americans get the
biggest bang for our buck when we prioritize energy development
and exploration in non-sensitive areas where there is also a
high likelihood of finding and harnessing significant energy
resources?
And I will start with you. Just a yes-or-no answer. Do you
agree with that statement?
Ms. Furchtgott-Roth. Energy companies have their own ways
of deciding which are the best investments, and sensitive or
less sensitive is not an objective manner of describing a
particular area.
Mr. Harrell. Yes, we need to produce more American energy.
Ms. Pleune. Yes, I think producing energy in a way that
reduces harms, avoids harms is a good idea.
Mr. Stein. Again, repeating the previous statement, the
sensitive versus not sensitive is a very subjective term, so it
is a little hard to agree or disagree with that----
Mrs. Lee. What about in areas with a higher likelihood of
producing energy?
Mr. Stein. Well, yes, but I think that is where investments
go.
Mrs. Lee. All right. Well, I represent a state that has an
incredibly wide range of energy sources. I come from Nevada. We
have critical minerals like lithium and, obviously, our
sunshine, a source of renewable. But what we don't have are
great quantities of oil and natural gas. Nonetheless, the GAO
reports that a shocking two-thirds of total acreage nominated
for onshore oil and gas leasing nationwide from 2009 to 2019
was in my home state of Nevada. That is 60.7 million out of
86.8 million acres.
BLM officials in Nevada have said that it took their staff
over 5 years just to review and process 28 million acres
nominated in my state in 2014, most of which did not result in
any energy production. In fact, of the 61 million acres
nominated in Nevada across this 10-year period--get this--out
of 61 million, only 3.5 million acres were ever actually
leased, including more than 2 million acres leased non-
competitively due to a lack of industry interest.
Professor Pleune, I would like to ask you, is it fair to
say that American taxpayers and our public lands both stand to
benefit from bipartisan policy-making that would shift focus
away from speculative and ultimately unproductive oil and gas
leasing in places like Nevada toward projects with a more
promising return on investment?
Ms. Pleune. That certainly sounds reasonable to me. The
last time I looked at the statistics, a significant number of
parcels do not get bid on.
And moreover, a large number of parcels do not go into
production. A GAO investigation looked at the number of APD
permits that were processed, whether or not they actually went
into production. And roughly half of all APD permits that are
processed never actually go into production, which is actually
quite a bit of waste of time, given that we have limited staff
capacity.
Furthermore, there is no system for regularly tracking
lease suspensions. So, the amount of leases that are currently
being held, even though they haven't gone into production, they
are in a suspended state and there is no systemic way of
identifying where they are, how long they have been suspended,
the reasons for suspension, and whether those reasons are still
justified.
Mrs. Lee. Yes. So, not only is this an incredible time suck
on behalf of staff, it also costs us taxpayers a lot of money.
I have just a few seconds remaining. I just wanted to ask
you, with NEPA, can you explain how prioritizing early
stakeholder consultation during the permitting process would
help the process along, and help industry build and avoid
costly changes and delays?
Ms. Pleune. Absolutely. One of the most productive methods
that we have seen toward improving the timelines of permit
processing is early engagement with stakeholders. That includes
all of the agencies that need to issue a permit on a project,
state and local governments, as well as people who are likely
to be affected by the project.
Agencies like FERC have even engaged in pre-application
meetings. This allows the permit applicant to identify at the
design phase sensitivities and regulatory standards that they
need to when it is least expensive in a project's life cycle. A
good example of this is the Nexus pipeline. They engaged in
early stakeholder engagement and, through a large process of
stakeholder engagement with the public, they ended up with
almost a 91 percent change in the course of the pipeline, which
would not have been something you could have done if it was
later in the cycle of the project. But because it was so early,
they were able to do it and avoid both sensitivities, as well
as opposition.
Mrs. Lee. Thank you. I am over my time.
Dr. Gosar. I thank the gentlewoman from Nevada. Great
conversation. I recognize the gentleman from Montana, Mr.
Rosendale, for his 5 minutes.
Mr. Rosendale. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Wow, this is fascinating. Ninety percent of the land in
Nevada didn't have oil and gas on it. I can tell you, spending
a little bit of time in the oil and gas industry myself, that
there is nothing more disappointing for someone who goes out
there and drills than to find a dry hole.
There is so much investment and research and development
that takes place to try to develop an oil field. And I assure
you that the people that are funding that are not expending
funds to enrich the state of Nevada; they are doing so because
they think that possibly that there is a resource underneath
the surface that they can develop. Unfortunately, most of the
oil and gas resources that they are tapping into are about 2
miles below the surface, so it is sort of hard to use a
divining rod and try to identify where they are.
Moving on to other permitting problems, which is not
anecdotal, I can tell you, coming from Montana, I testified at
the first public hearings to simply permit a pipeline, the
safest, most monitored pipeline that had been proposed in our
nation's history, and it was called the Keystone XL. And it
took 10 years from the time that those first hearings began
until it was finally permitted through an executive order, in
order to make sure that we could get those additional
resources, roughly 850,000 barrels a day of crude oil into our
country--150,000 barrels a day, which would have come from
Montana and North Dakota, so that we could increase our
domestic production.
And yet with the stroke of a pen, on his first day in
office, President Biden killed that pipeline, a pipeline. We
are not talking about drilling. We are talking about a pipeline
to transport these products. Again, the safest, most monitored
pipeline that had been proposed in the nation's history. That
cost the state of Montana $60 million a year in tax revenue
losses. And it was going through some of the poorest counties
in the state, places where that would have taken care of the
expense of the roads, and the schools, and the medical
facilities for those counties with populations of 1,500 to
2,000 people.
We haven't had a new mine permitted for 20 years. A lot of
this is our fault, right here, because Congress has continued
to write legislation that is so subjective, and then turn the
rulemaking authority over to the agencies to do. So, that is
our fault.
But I will also tell you that there is an awful lot of
litigation that takes place. We have activist judges that tie
these projects up, and there are attorneys and law firms that
get enriched because of it. And then agencies that overstep
their bounds, as evidenced by the most recent case that was
decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, West Virginia v. EPA, where
they did get outside of their lane, and they were told that,
no, you can't make those decisions, that the U.S. Congress
does.
All that being said, I would like to ask a couple of
questions to Ms. Furchtgott-Roth.
Ms. Furchtgott-Roth, who would you say, as far as a
specific demographic, is affected most by the Biden
administration's aggressive, climate justice-focused agenda,
and how, when it comes to energy?
Ms. Furchtgott-Roth. The lowest income are the most
affected, because they pay the highest proportion of their
income in electricity, motor fuel, and automotive costs. So,
the bottom 20 percent pay, on average, around 10 percent of
their income. The top 20 percent pay about 1 percent. So, when
you increase electricity and automotive costs, it is the poor
who are hurt most. This is not justice, not social justice, not
environmental justice.
Mr. Rosendale. Thank you. And in your testimony you speak a
lot on the Administration's push for electric vehicles. Can you
please delve deeper into the potential consequences this push
has had for the middle- and lower-income Americans if they are
forced to transition to electric vehicles, especially in the
more rural states and colder states like Montana?
Ms. Furchtgott-Roth. Right. Well, only 6 percent of new
vehicle sales last year were electric. It is because Americans
are smart, they know that electric vehicles are more expensive,
they have smaller range, they lose 25 to 40 percent of their
battery power in cold climates. It is hard to heat them in cold
climates.
That is why, for example, Wyoming has about 500 electric
vehicle registrations, even fewer in Montana, North Dakota,
South Dakota. They are just not practical. When people have
them, it is generally as a second, third, or fourth car. They
have an SUV, or a minivan, or a pickup truck if they want to go
on long trips. So, it is more expensive. It is a toy for the
upper-income groups. And having 60 percent of vehicles be
electric would impose a huge burden on low-income Americans.
Plus, we don't have the charging infrastructure for it yet,
especially since the Environmental Protection Agency has come
out with a new power plan this week that would make electricity
more expensive, due to the need for carbon sequestration.
Mr. Rosendale. Thank you so much.
Mr. Chair, I see I have expired my time. I would yield
back.
Dr. Gosar. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman from
California, Mr. Huffman, is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Huffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And it feels like
Groundhog Day here. We are once again discussing the apparently
dire need to attack and gut NEPA so that we can speed up fossil
fuel development and mining. This is a broken record that we
hear played all the time by our friends across the aisle.
And it is like a bad ventriloquist act when their lips are
moving, or when the fossil fuel industry's lips are moving,
Members of Congress are talking, and you can see it pretty
clearly. They don't like NEPA. They don't want to have to do
alternative analysis. They don't want to have to limit
environmental impacts. They don't want to have to actually
provide notice and get public input from disadvantaged
communities that are going to be hurt by their projects. So, we
have to take this industry speak with a grain of salt.
But when it comes to this latest narrative that has been
suggested a couple of times today, that clean energy and
electric transmission improvements require gutting NEPA, this
is especially false and reckless, and we need to start calling
it out. I am leading a task force for the Progressive Caucus
that is zeroing in on the real causes for delay.
So, Professor Pleune, I was especially interested in your
testimony because you have been doing the same thing. What we
are finding is that many of the biggest problems that have
delayed the kind of infrastructure and investments that we want
to see moving quickly, including transmission, have been
resolved by legislation already in the last couple of years,
and by new funding, and by executive orders on agency
coordination. And there are other major improvements that
actually are in the works under existing authorities, including
at FERC. And that is why, as you said, Professor, projects
actually are beginning to move faster. NEPA is becoming a less
compelling boogeyman all the time.
And I would like to just follow up, Professor Pleune,
because you talked about this very small percentage of
permitting projects that are actually subject to a full NEPA
analysis. And let me get this right. It is less than 1 percent,
is that right, a full EIS?
Ms. Pleune. The GAO estimated, government-wide, it is less
than 1 percent. When we looked at the Forest Service, they do
about 2 percent.
Mr. Huffman. You also alluded to the possibility that the
NEPA process, if it is done right, can actually move complex
projects faster by early engagement of communities that may be
impacted by that. Could you expand on that a little bit?
Ms. Pleune. I can. I actually have two examples of evidence
that shows that the NEPA process does speed up decision making.
The first is a natural example that was set up by a circuit
split, where in some areas identifying designated critical
habitat required a NEPA analysis and in the other circuits it
did not. And for those critical habitat designations that went
through the NEPA process, they were finished, on average, 3
months faster than the critical habitat designations that did
not go through the NEPA process.
There is another very interesting study done by the Office
of Investigation on APD permits. They found that the average
time to process the APDs was about 228 days. Pinedale was doing
it in 49 days. And the reason is that Pinedale had undergone a
very thorough programmatic EIS. It thoroughly understood the
well fields that it was developing, and so the implementation
piece was much faster.
Mr. Huffman. Would you agree that the biggest barrier to
renewable energy and electric transmission capacity is not
NEPA, but the interconnection, the dysfunctional and broken
interconnection queue at FERC?
Ms. Pleune. Yes, and it is often conflated with the NEPA
process because it is a part of the permitting process, but it
has nothing to do with environmental standards or NEPA.
Mr. Huffman. And FERC has proposed some major reforms to
fix this problem with the interconnection queue using existing
authority. My understanding is that, if the Senate would simply
confirm a fifth FERC commissioner, these reforms could move
forward. Is that your understanding?
Ms. Pleune. That is beyond my expertise.
Mr. Huffman. All right. I also understand----
Ms. Pleune. It sounds right.
Mr. Huffman. I also understand a certain Senator that is
targeting NEPA is the one holding up the confirmation of that
fifth FERC commissioner. So, these things get very interesting.
But perhaps the biggest delay I have heard with some of
these projects is market risk and financing, things that we
addressed last year in the Inflation Reduction Act. Would you
agree that these are game-changers, these new laws that we have
put on the books in this space?
Ms. Pleune. Absolutely. The new laws are game-changers.
And I will also note that, with the projects that have gone
through FAST-41, the things that they have found is, with the
structures that are in place, there is more predictability, and
that addresses that concern of not knowing when they will get a
permit approved.
Mr. Huffman. Thank you very much. I yield back.
Dr. Gosar. I thank the gentleman from California. The
gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Hunt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank the
witnesses, as well. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you
for being here. We really appreciate it.
In 2019, then-candidate for President Joe Biden said, and I
quote, ``We are going to ban fossil fuels. I guarantee it.''
Well, when tyrants speak, believe them. And one could argue
this will be the only campaign promise that Biden plans on
following in the future. With the radical climate lobby that
helped to put Joe Biden in the White House in the first place,
no matter how much American families suffer from the increased
energy prices directly resulting from Biden's policies, the
White House will continue to pursue this flawed and failed
agenda.
Energy bills for the people that I serve in Tomball, Texas,
which is actually the northern part of my district in a Houston
suburb, have doubled under Joe Biden. The Houston Chronicle, a
local publication, says that the natural gas bills in Houston
are soaring, and yet Biden and the climate cartel have spent
the last 2 years propagandizing an energy transition. And we
are transitioning all right, right into poverty.
The truth is, if you plan on continuing to live in a free
and prosperous society, then fossil fuels aren't going anywhere
for the foreseeable future. And here is where fantasy meets
reality. You see, on one hand, this Administration killed the
Keystone XL pipeline and placed a moratorium on all oil and gas
leases on Federal land. But then on the other hand, the Biden
administration wrote a letter to several oil companies
demanding they increase oil production and refining capacity.
Now, why would an energy company do that, if they know that
their industry is going to be killed in the not-so-distant
future? That is not capitalism and that is not America. That is
ridiculous.
On one hand, Biden wants to mandate that Americans drive
EVs. But then, on the other hand, he prohibits the domestic
mining of necessary materials to build these vehicles and their
batteries.
On the one hand, Biden says he wants to reduce carbon
emissions, and then turns around and he taxed the energy source
that is responsible for lowering U.S. emissions. And that,
ladies and gentleman, is natural gas.
On the one hand, Biden says that he wants to transition our
entire energy future, and he even said that he wants to make
sure that all government vehicles are powered by a renewable
source by 2035. And I am an Apache helicopter pilot. Good luck
with that. But then on the other hand, he has set up a
permitting and regulatory system that, as you mentioned in your
statement, Mr. Harrell, is procedurally impossible, and thank
you for being honest on that.
I am from Houston, Texas. Houston, Texas is the energy
capital of the world. I deem myself to be the energy
Congressman of the world. And I want to tell my friends on the
opposite side of the aisle something that is very important.
Every single oil and gas executive that I have spoken to in my
district in the energy corridor has never said anything
disparaging about renewable energy. Never. Not one. In fact, we
need more electrons. And we in Congress have to stop talking
about an energy transition, because that is a lie. This is
about energy addition.
In this country, we are sitting on the Marcellus Shale,
which I was told is the Saudi Arabia of natural gas. Now, for 2
years, when I was in the military, I was stationed in Saudi
Arabia. You want to talk about vast resources? The insinuation
that our country is sitting on a resource remotely close to the
oil in Saudi Arabia is unbelievable, and it is God-given. But
at the same time, New York has outlawed fracking, and the
Marcellus Shale is sitting right at their feet. Yet, the
Northeast would rather import heating oil from foreign
countries than tap the resource that is sitting right beneath
them.
This lack of coherent leadership is dangerous for our
country and for our children's future. We can only ride the
coattails of the good policies of the Trump administration for
so long. Joe Biden came for your gas stoves. He came for your
cars. Apparently now it is your dishwasher.
And as I said in the very beginning, Joe Biden said, and I
quote, ``We are going to ban fossil fuels.'' Promises made,
promises kept.
Thank you all so much for being here. And with that I yield
back.
Dr. Gosar. I thank the gentleman from Texas. The
gentlewoman from New Mexico, the Ranking Member, is recognized.
Ms. Stansbury. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the
opportunity to have this discussion. It is important that we
talk about energy and the energy transition, but it is also
important that we remain clear about what we are talking about.
I think that this has been a very muddled conversation this
afternoon. I have heard electricity conflated with heating
fuel, conflated with oil and gas, conflated with the vehicle
sector. So, there is a lot of confusion, I think, in this
conversation about what we are talking about in terms of energy
security here in the United States. So, I want to just re-
clarify.
Again, this is the second highest year of energy production
in American history. There has not been a ban on energy
production in the United States. In fact, the Administration
has approved recently several new lease plans in New Mexico,
which is my home state. Not only do we see the highest
production of oil and gas ever in our state's history, we are
seeing the highest profitability and first quarter profits of
oil and gas companies ever in the history of our state. Those
are the facts.
And as we have heard today, and I really want to thank Ms.
Pleune for being here today, when we look at the science, not
just anecdote, and I was really struck by your comments that
you analyzed over 41,000 NEPA decisions, 41,000 decisions, the
science shows that it is not the regulatory structure of NEPA
that causes delays.
So, I want to reiterate the three factors that were shared
here today, and then ask a couple of questions: the first is
staffing and capacity; the second is operator delays, meaning
the individuals who are seeking to have a decision approved may
not provide the appropriate paperwork that is required or, in
other cases, they may choose to not move forward with a project
because they don't have financing, the market conditions are
not right, and in fact, when we talk about many of these energy
mixes, the reason why they are not moving forward with these
projects is they are no longer profitable because technologies
have changed or there are other energy mixes coming online; and
the other is other laws.
So, I want to just take one moment, because the reason why
NEPA passed in 1969 and was signed into law by President Nixon,
a Republican administration, why the Council on Environmental
Quality was established in NEPA was because there were rivers
on fire, because we were strip mining our forests and precious
natural resources, and we were destroying sources of water
across the United States and significantly impacting what we
now call frontline communities, and especially those
communities that did not have a voice in these decision-making
processes.
And particularly significant for my state, in New Mexico,
are tribal voices and tribal consultation. And I do want to
take umbrage with something that was said just a few moments
ago, because there was a comment made about Resolution Copper
being delayed because of NEPA. That is factually untrue. Myself
and the Chairman of this Committee, excuse me, Ranking Member
of this Committee, Grijalva, had been working along with
Congresswoman Leger Fernandez to ensure that there is
appropriate tribal consultation to make sure that an
international mining company does not strip mine a tribal
sacred site that is protected by treaty and over 150 years of
Federal law. And that is why that project has been delayed, not
because of NEPA.
But let's talk about what can be done. Ms. Pleune, you said
in your testimony that good decisions are more important than
rush decisions. And I want to ask you, first, we are hearing a
lot of comments here, and we continue to hear these arguments
that we should just weaken NEPA or take it away, and somehow
that will solve the problem. What are the risks to our
communities and the environment if we were to do that?
Ms. Pleune. The risk of weakening NEPA is that NEPA is a
look-before-you-leap statute. It simply says look at what you
are going to do, and disclose the impacts. It provides an
opportunity to think before you do it, is there a way that I
can avoid, reduce, or mitigate risks or harms to communities?
It also provides an opportunity for communities to speak
and effect change on things that affect them. Weakening NEPA
weakens all of these opportunities.
Furthermore, a lot of delays that projects encounter are
due to different laws, there are overlapping laws. There are
different jurisdictions, and communities can use those
differences to stop a project if it is going to be harming
them. That is the whole point of laws; they protect people.
And using NEPA as a structure to bring people to the table
to understand the effects of a project, to synthesize the way
it is going to be analyzed and come to an agreement about
whether or not it goes forward is a productive, transparent
process that is appropriate to the democracy we live in.
Ms. Stansbury. Thank you, Ms. Pleune. I don't think I could
state it any more clear, so we appreciate you being here and
bringing good science and facts to this conversation.
Ms. Pleune. Thank you.
Dr. Gosar. I thank the gentlelady. The gentlelady from
Florida, Mrs. Luna, is recognized. Sorry. You should have
been----
Mrs. Luna. It is OK. Thank you, Chairman. Actually, since
we are clarifying facts, I just wanted to add some e-mails to
the record showing that CEQ did receive sufficient notice to
testify at today's hearing, if that is OK with you.
Dr. Gosar. So ordered.

[The information follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Mrs. Luna. Thank you very much. I wanted to read you guys
some facts. And I had actually heard what Ms. Diana Roth had
stated earlier.
When I sit up here and I hear legislators, on both sides
sometimes, talking about how we need to fully go green without
taking into account the impacts that it has, especially on
those that are not as fortunate in this country, I look at that
as rather tone deaf.
Some of these stats that I was able to look up during this
hearing, in 2021 the average salary of Black Americans is
$46,400 a year. In 2020, for Hispanics it was about $55,000.
And the poverty rate for Indigenous Americans is about a
quarter. So, when I see that the average cost for an electric
vehicle is $66,000, and then I hear that we need to be pushing
for more green initiatives, I think that that is done by people
who have maybe never even experienced the struggle.
I just got back recently from Indonesia on a congressional
delegation where we met with the President, where we met with
their parliament, and where we heard that American companies
were going there to mine things like cobalt and lithium, things
that we use here in the States to produce our own electric
vehicles because we know that this Administration, through the
Inflation Reduction Act and their war on fossil fuels, has been
pushing this. But when we asked the Indonesians what they were
doing for their own people, they said, ``Well, we use fossil
fuels.''
When we were in South Korea, even though they are moving
toward nuclear energy, they are still also using fossil fuels.
Yes, they have embraced going green. However, they are not
stupid enough to completely cut off their arm in the process
and hurt their own people in order to do so.
And, of course, then you have China, who doesn't really
care about the environment and is busy destroying it. So, when
I hear about these climate disasters, I take those things into
account.
My question is for you, Ms. Roth. How has the Biden
administration enabled our adversaries through these green
initiatives like China and Russia?
Ms. Furchtgott-Roth. China makes most of the components of
electric vehicles. They make the batteries, they make the
components, they make about 70 or 80 percent of wind turbines
and solar panels. So, the big question we have before us is
this: Is displacing American energy-intensive manufacturing and
sending it to China, does that help the environment at all?
Does that help the global climate? Does it help climate change?
And I would argue that the answer is no, because what we
are doing is giving up American jobs in energy-intensive
manufacturing sectors, giving up auto jobs. And these
individuals are hurt, and the Chinese are gaining. The Chinese
subsidize labor. They have forced labor from Xinjiang. They
subsidize energy. They have these coal-fired power plants that
we are not allowed to have here. They subsidize capital with
interest, very low interest loans to favored companies. And
they are gaining, and we are losing, and it is not helping the
environment.
That is the fundamental question before us: Is this harm we
are doing to America helping reduce emissions? I would answer
that the answer is no.
Mrs. Luna. Do you believe that politicians that lecture the
American people on climate justice should adhere to their own
ideologies? For example, should they ride bicycles to
Washington, DC? Do you think they should stop eating steak?
Because we have heard that cows contribute to and their
flatulence contributes to climate change and global warming. I
mean, don't you think that those people should embrace their
own ideologies?
Ms. Furchtgott-Roth. Food security is very important and
fossil fuels are needed for fertilizers. And we need to keep
the price of food low.
Again, it is low-income individuals that are hurt the most
because food is a high proportion of their income. And it is a
little strange to see people lecturing about the evils of
carbon emissions on planes, and then flying their own jets to
Davos to take part in conferences.
Mrs. Luna. Oh, that is my favorite. You watch them going in
on their G6 and you can see that they clearly have no clue on
how their legislation and their crazy ideologies are impacting
the rest of the world.
But thank you for your time.
Chairman, I yield back.
Dr. Gosar. I thank the gentlelady. I will recognize myself.
So, Mr. Harrell, a comment was made that a tribal site was
being condemned at Resolution Copper. Is that true,
particularly to the historian from the San Carlos Tribe?
Mr. Harrell. It is not true. And just to clarify my
statement in my testimony, I didn't use NEPA as the barrier for
Resolution Copper. I used it as the example of where we need to
have faith in decisions by the administration.
Over the last 9 years, since Congress enacted the land
exchange to move that project forward, a significant NEPA
process was done to move it forward. There was a record of
decision that was made almost 9 years later, and then 2 months
into this Administration they reversed that. There were
significant requirements for tribal consultation that were
followed by Interior over the course of that EIS, and we are
simply just disadvantaging ourselves in producing a robust
copper supply in this country.
Dr. Gosar. Well, I just wanted to make sure that the
consultation, based on historical sites, was not part of the
deal. So, just to set that straight.
My good friend from California made the comment about
financing. Can you tell me a little bit about ESG and some of
the threats in regards to getting financing for actually
applications for energy?
Mr. Harrell. Yes, absolutely, happy to talk about financing
for clean energy as a whole.
We need regulatory predictability. In the end, the biggest
thing that drives up private sector capital moving into
projects, whether it is wind, solar, transmission, nuclear
power, carbon capture, is regulatory uncertainty. In the end,
there needs to be confidence there is going to be a return on
investment, and folks simply need predictability.
So, I would argue that we have an environmental imperative
to more efficiently move energy and clean energy projects
forward.
Dr. Gosar. So, streamlining the process, I mean, there is
always improvement. I mean, as a businessman I have always
looked at that. As a dentist I have always looked at that. Is
there a way that we might have, like, a point person that
actually calibrates this? Instead of doing it linear, you are
doing it all at once. Could that be a benefit?
Mr. Harrell. Absolutely. And NEPA is just one piece of the
puzzle, right? There are a wide variety of the permits that
need to be done across agencies that have jurisdiction. We need
a lead person driving these type of things forward, and kind of
being that ombudsman, effectively, and ensuring the agencies
are working in tandem to approve things in an expeditious
manner.
Dr. Gosar. So, Ms. Roth, going back to this ESG phenomenon,
we had this in Oversight just yesterday. So, if you don't
pertain or hold to the particular nomenclature or let's say the
Administration's belief, you can't get funding. Does that cause
a problem?
Ms. Furchtgott-Roth. It causes a major problem for
companies who are downgraded by the Securities and Exchange
Commission because their projects might have climate risks and
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for banks,
because those projects might have climate risks. And it is very
difficult to measure these things. That is called Scope 1,
which is the immediate greenhouse gas consequences. Then there
is Scope 2, which is do your suppliers have any greenhouse gas
consequences for their suppliers? Then there are the suppliers
to the suppliers.
It is difficult to measure, and it gives our foreign
competitors an advantage because they do not have the
equivalent of the OCC or the SEC breathing down their necks, so
it makes their imports to us, their exports to us less
expensive, and it gives them an advantage. It drives down
American manufacturing, drives up American prices, hurts the
poor. And that is not any kind of justice.
Dr. Gosar. And I found it fascinating that investors were
actually talking that they could actually make up money based
upon ESG rulings, because they don't deliver the same kind of
punch for the dollar in investment purposes. I find that very
disingenuous because maybe we ought to go back to the way the
Fisher people look at things, and that is we do better when our
clients do better. We ought to be forthcoming about that. So,
this is an intricate web that is here.
I am known for my last question: Each one of you, what was
the question you most wanted to have asked and what is the
answer?
I am going to start with you, Ms. Roth.
Ms. Furchtgott-Roth. I think you could have asked about the
feasibility of net zero. And I just want to say that fossil
fuels are going to be with us as far as the eye can see.
First of all, if we imagine that the United States is
covered with solar panels and wind turbines, we need backup
natural gas plants to operate the source of electricity when
the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine.
Second, we need fossil fuels to actually make the wind
turbines and make the solar panels. So, the idea that we can
get rid of fossil fuels together is just a myth. It is just a
fantasy.
Third, I want to make it clear that the air and water in
the United States is getting cleaner. You look at the EPA
website, six criteria pollutants. They are all going down. So,
shifting manufacturing and energy production offshore where
there are more lenient rules for production is not helping.
Telling our companies they cannot drill for oil, going to Saudi
Arabia and Venezuela, asking them to produce oil rather than
our Canadian friends in the north, that does not help or reduce
global emissions. It increases global emissions.
We are doing a great job here of being energy independent.
We need to stay that way. We don't want to cede our
independence to China.
Dr. Gosar. Thank you.
Mr. Harrell?
Mr. Harrell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity
on that, a question about the feasibility of meeting our long-
term energy needs, both from an affordability and a climate
perspective.
When push comes to shove, we need to be focused on reducing
emissions, not on different fuel types as a whole. Natural gas
can play a huge role, both globally in reducing emissions and
meeting our energy needs here. We need more transmission, we
need more wind and solar, we need more nuclear power. We need
all of those technologies. We need to potentially double the
capacity of our grid to meet some of these energy and climate
objectives.
And one common thing is true: we are simply not building
technologies fast enough to meet those goals. So, we need to
find ways to cut down some of these timelines from 2\1/2\, 4\1/
2\ years to 18 months, things like that. And that does involve
proactive engagement with communities. It is trying to make
sure that we are doing a lot of the work up front.
But the one clear fact here is, if we are going to meet
those objectives, we simply cannot operate under the status
quo. We cannot deploy technologies at the pace and scale needed
under the status quo.
Dr. Gosar. Thank you.
Ms. Pleune?
Ms. Pleune. Thank you for this opportunity. I think I would
have liked to have been asked a little bit more about what are
the procedures in FAST-41 that do promote more efficiency, and
why is that?
And the main thing I would like to talk about is the way
that it has been able to promote coordination between
permitting authorities as a way to streamline the permitting
process. The procedures have been effective in achieving
predictability, transparency, and improved timelines, all
without compromising environmental standards or transparency.
Additional promising practices include encouraging the
development of MOUs between permitting authorities, especially
state, local, and tribal authorities. To do that, the agencies
need the funds, the time, the people, and the people with the
expertise to get that done.
Second, encouraging details between agencies to facilitate
interagency coordination. That way they will understand how
each other work, and be able to coordinate better.
Third, developing protocols for data sharing, mapping, and
permit sequencing. This way we don't have to re-analyze
decisions every time they come up.
Fourth, propagating best practices through training and
interagency collaboration, one thing the Permitting Council has
already started. And just through that it is already showing
improvements, not only in the complex permitting processes but
in the more simple ones.
I think these are very promising practices. I think they
offer the opportunity to speed the pace of implementation and
permitting without compromising environmental standards. Thank
you.
Dr. Gosar. Thank you. You do know I am from Wyoming, from
Pinedale, Wyoming, do you not?
Yes, just a reason I understand the Pinedale model.
Mr. Stein?
Mr. Stein. Yes, I would have liked there to have been a
little more discussion of the role of litigation in all these
delays that we have discussed. A lot of the focus of the NEPA
discussion was on the procedural within the administrative
state. And while that is slower than it should be, that is not
the true delay. It is the process through the courts, it is the
uncertainty in the courts, too. Unfortunately, Congress has
left far too much of NEPA implementation to court
interpretation.
So, a lot of the uncertainty that slows down some of the
administrative decisions and slows down financing decisions is
that uncertainty of litigation, sometimes litigation that is
funded by the Federal Government itself, and lack of clarity
about what is required to actually perform a NEPA analysis
correctly.
Dr. Gosar. Thank you. I think we have had a wonderful
discussion across the board, and I think there is more that
needs to happen in regards to clarity, transparency, and
accountability. And I think some of it belongs to us. I think
Congress has to recoup its power of the purse and balance this
baby off.
I want to thank all the witnesses for their valuable
testimony and the Members for their questions.
The members of this Committee may have some additional
questions for you. We will ask them to respond with those in
writing. Under Committee Rule 3, members of the Committee must
submit questions to the Subcommittee Clerk by 5 p.m. on May 16.
The hearing record will be held open for 10 business days for
those responses.
If there is no further business, without objection, the
Committee stands adjourned.

[Whereupon, at 3:44 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
