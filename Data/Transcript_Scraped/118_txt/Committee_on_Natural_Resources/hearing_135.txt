III. BACKGROUND

H.R. 3283 (Rep. Miller-Meeks), ``Facilitating DIGITAL Applications
Act''
An affordable and reliable connection to high-speed internet, or
broadband, is vital to many aspects of modern life.\1\ Broadband access
requires the support of various technologies, including cable,
telephone wire, fiber, satellite, and mobile and fixed wireless
transmitters.\2\ From online education to telemedicine and ecommerce,
essential activities, experiences, and interactions increasingly occur
online.\3\ For large segments of the population, however, the
transition into the digital world remains elusive.\4\ Deploying
broadband technology in rural areas presents challenges due to lower
population densities, vast distances, and rugged topography.\5\ To
reach rural and tribal areas, much of this infrastructure must be
installed on federal land.\6\ However, broadband providers must endure
burdensome permitting requirements and application processes imposed by
federal, state, and local governments.\7\ These regulatory hurdles
raise the costs of, and bring delay and uncertainty to, broadband
development plans.\8\ As a result, rural and tribal areas ``tend to lag
behind urban and suburban areas in broadband deployment and the speed
of service offered.'' \9\ This discrepancy in broadband accessibility
is so pronounced it now broadly known as the ``digital divide.'' \10\

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service
(USFS) process the most applications and communications use
authorizations to install communications facilities on federal
property.\11\ Communications use authorizations are requests for
easements, rights-of-way, leases, or other authorizations ``to locate
or modify a transmitting device, support structure, or other
communications facility'' on public lands.\12\ Presently, USFS manages
over 1,400 communications sites and administers more than 4,000
communications use authorizations on national forests and
grasslands.\13\ Communications facilities support over 10,000
``wireless uses'' for governments, utility companies, private
businesses, and individuals.\14\ Similarly, on public lands, BLM
administers more than 1,500 communications sites and has authorized the
installation and operation of more than 4,000 additional communications
facilities.\15\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite these figures, the Department of the Interior (DOI) and
USFS impose formidable regulatory barriers to broadband deployment.\16\
Before they can construct or operate the necessary facilities on
federal land, broadband providers must typically participate in a pre-
application meeting, complete the Standard Form 299 application
materials, and undergo extensive review periods.\17\ The agencies face
a statutory requirement to grant or deny these applications within 270
days.\18\ In practice, however, this process can be much lengthier. The
U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently reported that
roughly half of the communications use applications submitted to the
BLM and USFS from fiscal year (FY) 2018 to FY 2022 either exceeded the
270-day deadline or lacked sufficient data to conclude whether the
deadline had been met.\19\ Broadband developers report that fiber
deployment in rural areas takes, on average, between five to 10 years
to complete.\20\ These lengthy wait times dissuade many would-be-
providers from even applying in the first place. Without lowering these
obstacles, the ``digital divide,'' and its harmful consequences, will
persist.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expanding public access to broadband requires making targeted and
complementary reforms to the existing regulatory system. H.R. 3283
seeks to ameliorate these challenges by making transparent key federal
efforts to streamline broadband deployment in rural and tribal areas.
Specifically, the bill would require the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to regularly
report to Congress on the extent to which DOI and USFS established
online portals for accepting, processing, and disposing of a Form 299
for communications use authorizations.\21\ H.R. 3283 requires the NTIA
to submit these reports every 60 days until the portals are
established.\22\ Such reporting would allow for improved tracking of
efforts to deploy broadband on federal land.\23\ This bipartisan
legislation is sponsored by Representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-
IA-01) and cosponsored by Representative Debbie Dingell (D-MI-06).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.R. 3299 (Rep. Cammack), ``DIGITAL Applications Act''

H.R. 3299 is complementary legislation to H.R. 3283. Whereas H.R.
3283 requires reports on online portals for processing Form 299s for
communications use authorizations, H.R. 3299 sets the requirement for
DOI and USFS to establish these separate online portals.\24\ The
legislation also requires DOI and USFS to notify the NTIA within three
business days of establishing their respective portals.\25\ After that,
the NTIA must create links to those portals from its own website.\26\
Together, these provisions create an online, ``one-stop-shop'' for
applicants to apply for communications use authorizations from federal
land managers.\27\ In the process, the bill promises to bring
transparency and accountability to an important application system.
This bipartisan legislation is sponsored by Representative Kat Cammack
(R-FL-03) and co-sponsored by Representative Doris Matsui (D-CA-07).

H.R. 5401 (Rep. D'Esposito), ``9/11 Memorial and Museum Act''

The National September 11 Memorial & Museum is located in lower
Manhattan at the site of the former World Trade Center in New York
City. Also known as the 9/11 Memorial & Museum, this unique facility
serves as the principal tribute of remembrance and honor to the nearly
3,000 people killed in the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center
site on September 11, 2001. It also honors the six victims killed in
the World Trade Center bombing on February 26, 1993. Since its
dedication on September 11, 2011, the Memorial has attracted more than
72 million visitors, while the nearby Museum has drawn over 22 million
visitors since opening to the public in 2014.\28\ The World Trade
Center Foundation, Inc., a private, not-for-profit organization,
operates the 9/11 Memorial & Museum. In fulfilling its important
mission, the 9/11 Memorial & Museum has shouldered substantial costs.
Construction of the facility totaled $700 million and operating
expenses are approximately $111 million annually.\29\ Security for the
premises, which must always be sustained at high levels, costs
approximately $1 million per month.\30\

.epsAfter nearly 23 years since the 9/11 attacks, it has grown
increasingly important to educate younger generations about the tragic
events of that day, the national response the attack elicited, and the
broader consequences of terrorism.\31\ Yet the passage of time also
makes funding more difficult to obtain.\32\ In the face of diminishing
financial support, the 9/11 Memorial & Museum may also find itself
vulnerable to increased security risks.\33\ Accordingly, H.R. 5401
provides a one-time grant--from $5 million to $10 million--from the
Department of Homeland Security to assist the 9/11 Memorial & Museum
defray its significant costs.\34\ Grant funding would come out of
appropriations to the Department of Homeland Security. Specifically,
the authorized funding would help the 9/11 Memorial & Museum continue
operations, increase safety measures, and provide free admission for
military veterans, first responders, and victims' families.\35\ This
legislation is sponsored by Representative Anthony D'Esposito (R-NY-04)
and 37 additional bipartisan cosponsors.\36\

H.R. 6012 (Rep. Carbajal), ``Fire Safe Electrical Corridors Act of
2023''

Overgrown, unhealthy, and fire-prone federal forests are
tinderboxes that pose significant threats to Western communities in the
wildland-urban interface. Downed hazard trees within utility rights-of-
way (ROW) remain one of the biggest ignition threats and have sparked
some of the most significant and deadly fires in the country's history.
For example, the largest single wildfire in California state history,
the Dixie Fire, ignited when a tree fell onto electrical lines.\37\
Catastrophic fires in Maui and Texas over the last two years have also
been linked to downed utility lines.\38\ To address these threats,
utility companies attempt to maintain clear ROW and fell hazard trees
within their utility corridors under a special use permit from the
USFS. To dispose of the felled timber, however, utilities companies are
currently required to go through a lengthy timber sale process.\39\
This frequently leads to wood waste stacking up in piles and not being
removed, further heightening wildfire risk. This unnecessarily costly
and time-consuming process for removing hazard trees in needlessly
preventing active management in some of the highest risk areas of our
national forests.\40\ H.R. 6012, the ``Fire Safe Electrical Corridors
Act,'' would allow USFS to permit utility companies to fully remove
hazard trees and other vegetation within the vicinity of distribution
or transmission lines without going through a separate timber sale. If
the utilities eventually sell the used material, this legislation
requires the proceeds to be returned to USFS, accounting for any
transportation costs. This bipartisan legislation is sponsored by
Representative Salud Carbajal (D-CA-24) and co-led by Representative
Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-OR-05).

H.R. 7976 (Rep. Holmes Norton), ``Civil War Defenses of Washington
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
National Historical Park Act''

By the end of the Civil War, the nation's capital was heavily
fortified by ``68 forts, supported by 93 detached batteries for field
guns, 20 miles of rifle pits, and covered ways, wooden blockhouses at
three key points, 32 miles of military roads, several stockaded
bridgeheads, and four picket stations.'' \41\ These forts and defenses
not only protected the residents of Washington, D.C. but ``many
enslaved people came to the fort system for protection and settled
nearby.'' \42\ Today, the remaining sites are collectively known as the
``Civil War Defenses of Washington'' (CWDW) and are dispersed among
Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia. 17 of the original forts
associated with the CWDW are managed by the National Park Service
(NPS), with other sites under state, local, or private ownership.\43\
Collectively, these sites tell an important story about the Civil War
and the efforts of the Union Army to make the nation's capital ``one of
the most heavily fortified cities of the world.'' \44\ They also serve
as hallowed reminders of the sacrifices made to protect democracy,
freedom, and the union during the Civil War.

H.R. 7976 redesignates the CWDW as the ``Civil War Defenses of
Washington National Historical Park.'' National Historical Parks (NHP)
are considered the most appropriate designation for NPS units with
multiple historic sites included within the boundaries. Included in
this designation are 18 federally owned forts or batteries. The bill
designates four additional areas as affiliated units with the CWDW NHP.
The bill requires several studies to evaluate potential additional
areas for inclusion or affiliation with the NHP, as well as a study on
broader Civil War history. This legislation will ensure the rich and
storied history associated with the CWDW carries on through generations
and told in a more holistic, organized, and cohesive manner.

H.R. 8012 (Rep. Waltz), ``Jackie Robinson Commemorative Site Act''
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6224.002

.epsIn 1946, Brooklyn Dodgers manager Branch Rickey invited Jackie
Robinson to spring training in Daytona Beach, Florida, following a
standout college baseball career.\45\ At the time, Jim Crow laws
prevented integrated baseball throughout the South. However, Rickey
worked with city officials and convinced the mayor to provide an
exception for Robinson. On March 17, 1946, the first racially
integrated spring training game was played at what is today known as
the Jackie Robinson Ballpark in Daytona Beach.\46\ Throughout the rest
of spring training, many games outside of Daytona Beach were canceled,
despite high demand from many tourists to support Robinson in the
stands.\47\ Robinson would go on to lead the Montreal Royals, the
Triple-A affiliate of the Brooklyn Dodgers, to a minor league
championship later that year.\48\ Following this success, on April 10,
1947, Jackie Robinson signed his first National League contract. Five
days later, Robinson would make his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut
in front of over 26,000 spectators at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. In
doing so, Robinson broke the MLB's color barrier, becoming the league's
first African American to play in an MLB game in the modern era.\49\ He
would go on to finish his career with a .311 batting average, amass
over 1,500 hits, and become a six-time all-star.\50\

H.R. 8012 would designate the Jackie Robinson Ballpark in Daytona
Beach, Florida, as the ``Jackie Robinson Ballpark National
Commemorative Site.'' As a National Commemorative Site, the ballpark
would not be a unit of the National Park System. The bill includes
provisions to prevent any interference with the rights of private
property owners, local zoning ordinances, or land use plans.
Additionally, the new National Commemorative Site would be included in
the African American Civil Rights Network.\51\ By designating the
ballpark as a National Commemorative Site, H.R. 8012 recognizes the
facility's historic role in advancing civil rights without adding to
the federal estate or using taxpayer dollars. The legislation is
sponsored by Representative Michael Waltz (R-FL-06) and has 50
bipartisan cosponsors.

U.S. House of Representatives

Subcommittee on Federal Lands

Committee on Natural Resources

Washington, DC

----------

The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:15 a.m. in
Room 1324, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Tom Tiffany
[Chairman of the Subcommittee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Tiffany, Stauber, Bentz; and
Porter.
Also present: Representatives D'Esposito, Miller-Meeks,
Waltz; Hoyle, and Norton.

Mr. Tiffany. The Subcommittee on Federal Lands will come to
order.
Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a
recess of the Subcommittee at any time.
The Subcommittee is meeting today to consider six bills:
H.R. 3283, by Representative Miller-Meeks; H.R. 3299,

Without objection, so ordered.
I will now recognize myself for an opening statement.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. TOM TIFFANY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN

Mr. Tiffany. The bills on today's legislative agenda take
important steps to broaden access to the digital world of the
future, while also honoring our past by supporting important
historical and commemorative sites across the country.
Affordable and reliable high-speed Internet or broadband is
vital to many aspects of modern life, including telemedicine
and online education. Too often, however, rural and tribal
areas have difficulty fully participating in the digital world.
To expand access to these areas, additional broadband
facilities must be deployed on Federal land.
Unfortunately, the current regulatory climate places
considerable obstacles in the way of rural broadband providers,
ranging from burdensome permitting requirements to lengthy
application processes. In fact, broadband developers have
reported that deployments on Federal land often take between 5
and 10 years to complete. It is no wonder, then, that the
digital divide remains so persistent, including in my home
state of Wisconsin.
According to a 2023 report from the Wisconsin Governor's
Task Force on Broadband Access, 10 percent of Wisconsin's homes
and businesses lack basic access to the Internet, and more than
20 percent don't have access to any high-speed broadband
services. Those are the statewide figures. But in Wisconsin's
rural areas, including the communities in my district, the
number of homes without access to broadband jumps
exponentially.
Through joint targeted reforms, H.R. 3283 and H.R. 3299
would improve the current permitting system. Specifically,
Representative Cammack's bill would require the Department of
the Interior and the U.S. Forest Service to establish online
portals for accepting, processing, and disposing of
communications use authorizations. Representative Miller-Meeks'
legislation complements this effort by adding needed mechanisms
for transparency and accountability, and setting up these
portals. These bipartisan bills will help set up a digital one-
stop-shop for communications use authorizations, making it
easier for providers to build new broadband infrastructure on
Federal lands. This is a common-sense fix that will help make
the broadband permitting process less cumbersome and time-
consuming.
Representative Miller-Meeks and Cammack's legislation is
the latest in a series of bills this Subcommittee has
considered to expand broadband access. Earlier this year, the
Committee marked up legislation from Representative Fulcher,
the BARS Act, that addressed NEPA delays with siting broadband
infrastructure on Federal lands in previously disturbed rights-
of-ways. Taken together, these bills will help close the
digital divide by adding transparency, accountability, and
efficiency to a flawed Federal communications system.
The remaining three bills recognize and support important
historical sites across the country.
Representative D'Esposito's legislation would provide a
one-time grant to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum in New York
City. The Memorial and Museum is the principal tribute of
remembrance and honor to the nearly 3,000 people killed by
terrorists on September 11, 2001. Security costs for protecting
the site, its staff, and its visitors remain high. The single
grant authorized by this bill would provide needed funding to
this hallowed site to help ensure that future generations
continue to learn the lessons of this tragic historical event
in American history.
Additionally, we are considering a bill sponsored by
Delegate Holmes Norton that would designate the Civil War
Defenses of Washington, DC as a national historical park.
Included in that designation are a collection of forts,
artillery batteries, and other defense structures that were
built to protect the nation's capital during the Civil War.
Eighteen of those sites are already federally owned, while the
remaining locations will be incorporated into the historical
park as affiliated sites governed by locally-led cooperative
agreements with the National Park System.
Finally, H.R. 8012, sponsored by Representative Waltz,
would designate the Jackie Robinson Ballpark in Daytona Beach,
Florida as the Jackie Robinson Ballpark National Commemorative
Site. Before going on to break Major League Baseball's color
barrier in 1947, Jackie Robinson broke the racial divide that
segregated players in the minor leagues. This bill would
commemorate the ballpark where that momentous event occurred
without adding to the Federal estate or using taxpayer dollars.
Jackie Robinson's story is a powerful reminder of the unifying
power of sports, and this legislation is an appropriate honor
for his extraordinary legacy.
Finally, I would like to highlight the bipartisan Fire Safe
Electrical Corridors Act offered by Representatives Carbajal
and Chavez-DeRemer. This legislation would make it easier for
utility companies to clear overgrown vegetation and hazard
trees in rights-of-way. This legislation would support more
active management of our overgrown, fire-prone forests, and
protect communities in the wildland-urban interface from the
risk of catastrophic wildfire.
As of yesterday, catastrophic wildfires have already burned
another 2.8 million acres this year. A few weeks ago, this
Committee marked up the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act by voice
vote, a bill that I am co-sponsoring. I look forward to working
with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that we
can get meaningful, historic, and desperately-needed forest
management reforms enacted into law this year.
I want to thank Members on both sides of the dais for their
work on today's bills. I also want to express my appreciation
to the witnesses appearing before us today.
I appreciate you taking the time to travel to be here to
provide your expert testimony.
OK. We are going to start with our first panel, and I would
like to recognize Representative Miller-Meeks for 5 minutes in
regards to H.R. 3283.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. MARIANNETTE MILLER-MEEKS, A
REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF IOWA

Mrs. Miller-Meeks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you
for inviting me to speak in support of my bipartisan bill, H.R.
3283, the Facilitating Digital Applications Act.
This bill requires the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration to submit a report on the
development of online portals for processing applications for
communication use authorizations.
As Members from all over the country that represent rural
districts understand, broadband deployment in rural areas is
both expensive and time-consuming. Broadband for providers face
multiple regulatory hurdles, particularly when infrastructure
build-out covers a portion of Federal land. Under the current
system, the Bureau of Land Management requires providers
applying for right-of-way permits to download a standard Form
299, arrange for a pre-application meeting with the BLM staff,
and submit a completed application either in person or through
the mail, in addition to undergoing extensive review periods.
These forms can be filed multiple times a day by a single
applicant.
Agencies often exceed the 270-day statutory time limit for
approving or denying applications. This lengthy process jams up
states' build-out plans, and creates economic uncertainty for
providers, and I have witnessed this firsthand in my state of
Iowa. The current method is inefficient and, frankly, outdated.
A permitting regime that incorporates an online portal
submission process for applications would allow for the rapid
exchange of information between applicants and Federal
agencies. This would cut down on the time that it takes
agencies to process paperwork, and it would lessen the burden
on the applicant by creating a central hub for project
information.
The Facilitating Digital Applications Act is a key
component of this mission to make permitting more efficient. It
directs NTIA to submit a report to Congress on the progress of
launching an online submission portal for applications within
90 days of the bill's enactment, and every 60 days thereafter
until the portals are established. It is a complement to
Representative Cammack's bill, which begins the process of
delineating how online applications should be structured. By
requiring these reports, Congress can gain deeper insight into
the Federal permitting process and take a crucial step in
eliminating barriers to a more efficient broadband
infrastructure deployment.
The need for this bill is evident. Many families and
businesses across the country still lack access to broadband.
As we look across our districts, we know that this service gap
can result in negative impacts on Americans' health, education,
and financial outcomes. Nothing exposed this reality for rural
areas more acutely than the COVID-19 pandemic. In today's
economy, it is more important than ever that we reduce
bureaucratic red tape and make common-sense solutions to close
the digital divide.
I thank the Chairman once again for holding this important
hearing. I thank the witnesses in advance for their testimony.
I yield back.

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Representative Miller-Meeks, for
your testimony. And now we are going to move on to the
testimony from Delegate Holmes Norton in regards to H.R. 7976.
Ma'am, you have 5 minutes. Welcome to the Committee.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, A DELEGATE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

Ms. Norton. Thank you, Chairman Tiffany, for holding this
hearing and allowing me to testify on H.R. 7976, the Civil War
Defenses of Washington National Historical Park Act.
The Civil War Defenses of Washington, including forts,
unarmed batteries, and rifle trenches created a ring of
protection for the nation's capital during the Civil War. The
bill would recognize and preserve the Defenses of Washington
located in the District of Columbia, Virginia, and Maryland by
re-designating the 22 Defenses of Washington currently under
National Park Service jurisdiction as a National Historic Park,
and allowing other sites associated with the Defenses of
Washington that are owned by DC or a unit of state government
to be affiliated with the National Historic Park through
cooperative agreements.
This bill would also require the Secretary of the Interior
to facilitate the history of the Civil War, including the
history of the Defenses of Washington and the Shenandoah Valley
Campaign of 1864 being assembled, arrayed, and conveyed for the
benefit of the public.
The Defenses of Washington were constructed at the
beginning of the war in 1861 as a ring of protection for the
nation's capital and for President Abraham Lincoln. By the end
of the war, these defenses included 68 forts, 93 unarmed
batteries, 807 mounted cannons, 13 miles of rifle trenches, and
32 miles of military roads.
The major test of the Defenses of Washington came from the
Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1864, when Confederate Lieutenant
General Jubal Early, directed by General Robert E. Lee, sought
to attack the nation's capital from the north, causing Union
forces threatening to attack Richmond, the capital of the
Confederacy, to be withdrawn. General Early was delayed by
Union Major General Lew Wallace at the Battle of Monocacy on
July 9, 1864, and was stopped at the northern edge of
Washington at the Battle of Fort Stevens on July 11 and 12,
1864. The Shenandoah Valley Campaign ended when Union
Lieutenant General Philip Sheridan defeated General Early at
the Battle of Cedar Creek, Virginia, on October 19, 1864.
Nearly all the individual forts in the Defenses of
Washington on both sides of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers
were involved in stopping General Early's attack, and the
Battle of Fort Stevens was the second and last attempt by the
Confederate Army to attack Washington. Taken together, these
battles were pivotal to the outcome of the war and the freedom
and democracy that the war represented for this country. It is
therefore fitting that we recognize the Defenses of Washington
by re-designating them as a National Historic Park.
Again, I thank you for holding this hearing and allowing me
to testify, and I look forward to working with you to pass this
bill.

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Delegate Holmes Norton. And now I
would like to recognize Representative D'Esposito for 5 minutes
in regards to H.R. 5401.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. ANTHONY D'ESPOSITO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK

Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you very much, Chairman Tiffany and
the entire Subcommittee, for taking on this critical
legislation today.
I would also like to thank Mr. Joe Quinn, who traveled here
today to speak on the importance of this legislation.
Mr. Quinn, I am extremely sorry for your loss, and remind
you that we will never, ever forget.
On September 11, 2001, nearly 3,000 Americans tragically
lost their lives on a Pennsylvania field, the World Trade
Center in New York City, and at the Pentagon, just miles away
in Virginia. Over 20 years later, we continue to lose people to
9/11-related illnesses. Each year for over two decades, our
nation has vowed to never forget the friends, the families, the
brothers, the sisters, the mothers, the fathers, the daughters,
or the sons that we lost that day; to never forget the heroism
of the first responders that ran into the towers to save their
fellow man at the cost of their own lives; to never forget the
national resilience this nation witnessed in the days and weeks
that followed.
Today, here in 2024, every kid that is in high school was
born after 9/11, making our nation's vow to never forget and to
educate the next generation more critically important than
ever.
Mr. Chairman, on the wall of the National September 11th
Memorial and Museum there is a quote from Virgil: ``No day
shall erase you from the memory of time.'' The Memorial and
Museum in New York City sits on the site of the World Trade
Center and memorializes every individual who lost their lives
on September 11th. In the museum, you can listen to the last
phone calls made from the towers and on those planes to loved
ones to say goodbye. You can look at photos of the nearly 3,000
victims and see some of their belongings that helped tell the
story of their life. You can see the posters of desperate loved
ones looking for their friends or family in the days and the
weeks following that devastating attack on our American soil.
You could see for yourself the destruction and devastation
caused that day.
Mr. Chairman, it is impossible to walk out of that museum
unchanged by what you have seen, what you have heard, and, more
importantly, what we have learned. The National September 11th
Memorial and Museum upholds this nation's promise to never
forget, and it is absolutely critical that the museum has the
resources it needs to continue to educate both Americans and
visitors from every corner of this world.
My legislation would authorize up to $10 million in
additional funds for the museum to help them continue to tell
these critical stories and ensure the next generation
understands what our nation lost that day. It will also help
keep the museum and all its visitors and staff safe from, God
forbid, another attack.
As a lifelong New Yorker and a retired NYPD detective who
lost and continues to lose friends, I am proud to have
introduced this legislation. And to the families and survivors
of 9/11, I will never, ever stop fighting on your behalf in
Congress.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Representative D'Esposito. Now I
would like to recognize Representative Waltz for 5 minutes in
regards to H.R. 8012.
Sir, the floor is yours.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. MICHAEL WALTZ, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

Mr. Waltz. Thank you, Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member
Neguse, and members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the
opportunity to testify today in support of my bipartisan and
bicameral H.R. 8012, led in the Senate by Senator Rubio, the
Jackie Robinson Ballpark Commemorative Site Act to honor Jackie
Robinson's legacy by memorializing the stadium where Jackie
Robinson played his first professional game and broke
baseball's color barrier.
This bill would designate the Jackie Robinson Ballpark in
Daytona Beach, Florida as a National Commemorative Site.
Additionally, this bill would add the ballpark to the African
American Civil Rights Network, as well as direct the Secretary
of the Interior to conduct a feasibility study to start the
process designating the stadium as a National Historic
Landmark.
The City of Daytona Beach and the then-named Daytona City
Island Ballpark were the first city and stadium to allow Jackie
Robinson to play during the 1946 season spring training.
Robinson signed to play then for the AAA Montreal Royals, who
held spring training in Florida with the Brooklyn Dodgers.
Local baseball affiliates in Jacksonville and Sanford, believe
it or not, they locked their stadiums to not allow Robinson and
the Royals to play. They forced the cancellation of exhibition
games due to local laws and ordinances that prohibited mixed
race athletics.
Thankfully, and I am proud to say, Daytona Beach permitted
the game. And on March 17, 1946, Jackie Robinson played his
first professional baseball game in Daytona City Island
Ballpark, helping to change the course of American history.
Jackie Robinson would go on to lead the Royals to a minor
league championship in 1946. The next year he was promoted to
the Dodgers, and then broke Major League Baseball's color
barrier.
Importantly, Mr. Chairman, the Dodger Stadium has since
been torn down. So, this stadium in Daytona Beach would be the
living and still standing landmark commemorating this historic
event.
In his book, ``My Own Story,'' Jackie Robinson reflected on
the importance of this first game, stating, ``I knew, of
course, that everyone wasn't pulling for me to make good, but I
sure know that the whole world wasn't lined up against me. When
I went to sleep the applause was still ringing in my ears.''
Now home to the Daytona Tortugas and the oldest active
ballpark in minor league baseball, Jackie Robinson Stadium is a
historic landmark, a reminder of the Civil Rights Movement and
the integration of modern professional baseball.
Mr. Chairman, I urge this Subcommittee to preserve and
honor Jackie Robinson's legacy and the impact he had on the
future of this country. We have over 50 co-sponsors on this
bill.
I thank the Subcommittee for allowing me to speak today on
this bill, and I hope we can preserve this ballpark for
generations to come.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield.

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Mr. Waltz, for your testimony. We
are going to move on to our second panel now.
Let me remind the witnesses that under Committee Rules, you
must limit your oral statement to 5 minutes, but your entire
statement will appear in the hearing record.
To begin your testimony, please press the ``on'' button on
the microphone.
We use timing lights. When you begin, the light will turn
green. At the end of 5 minutes, the light will turn red, and I
will ask you to please wrap up your statement.
First, I would like to introduce Mr. Chris French, Deputy
Chief of the National Forest System at the U.S. Forest Service.
Deputy Chief French, welcome back to the Committee. You are
recognized for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF CHRIS FRENCH, DEPUTY CHIEF, NATIONAL FOREST
SYSTEM, U.S. FOREST SERVICE, WASHINGTON, DC

Mr. French. Thank you, Chairman Tiffany and members of the
Committee. My name is Chris French, the Deputy Chief of the
National Forest System for the U.S. Forest Service. Thank you
for the opportunity to provide the perspective of the USDA
Forest Service in support of these three public land bills
under consideration today.
The Forest Service manages 193 million acres of public
national forests and grasslands that provide a wide range of
benefits including jobs, drinking water, food, wood and fiber,
and extensive recreational opportunities. The agency also
supports important services for the benefit of the American
people by way of permitting nearly 66,000 special uses across
the National Forest System, including communication sites and
power line corridors.
The bills we are discussing today aim to support the
agency's mission and supporting the communication needs of the
American public, and helping to maintain safe corridors for our
electric infrastructure. The USDA supports the intent of H.R.
3299 and H.R. 3283, which addressed the permitting of
communications infrastructure on National Forest System lands.
The Forest Service has made some recent advances in
establishing an online portal system that are relevant to these
bills. We defer to the Department of the Interior and the
Department of Commerce on elements of the bill and their
purview.
H.R. 3299 aims to improve the agency's communication
permitting program by requiring the agency to establish a
public-facing online portal system to accept, process, and
dispose of applications for communication use authorizations.
H.R. 3283 would require the Forest Service to submit
information to the Assistant Secretary for the Department of
Commerce, who would be responsible for reporting to Congress on
whether USDA and other agencies have established online portals
for communication use authorization.
We acknowledge the need for an online portal system. Such a
system will help us ensure that we can effectively process and
permit critical infrastructure that provides communication
services, including broadband, to the American people. With
this in mind, the Forest Service is already investing heavily
in developing a robust digital permitting system that we hope
will improve our applicants' experience and potentially
significantly improve the entire approval process.
We would like to work with the bill's sponsors in the
Committee to offer some technical changes, given our ongoing
efforts to develop enhanced digital services, and to address
concerns about the potential burden of reporting requirements
within the bill.
H.R. 6012 would grant the Secretary of Agriculture
authority to allow electric utilities operating under special
use permits or easements on National Forest System lands to cut
and remove vegetation adjacent to power lines without requiring
a separate timber sale. Vegetation can fall on or damage power
lines, sometimes causing costly fires, power outages, and
resource damage. Power line rights-of-way on National Forest
System lands need constant maintenance to ensure safe delivery
of electric power to the American people. H.R. 6012 intends to
help facilitate the removal of unsafe vegetation adjacent to
power lines, which would greatly reduce the risk of fires.
Funding for vegetation removal can be a barrier to needed
maintenance, especially for small, rural utilities. H.R. 6012
would hasten the removal of unsafe vegetation by eliminating
the need to prepare and process a timber sale.
In addition, any proceeds from the sale of any merchantable
fiber by the utility can be applied to the cost of transporting
unsafe vegetation adjacent to power lines to market. The bill
would not change required compliance with any environmental
laws or regulations.
USDA supports the intent of H.R. 6012, and would like to
work with the Committee and the bill's sponsors to fully
realize the bill's intention to facilitate the removal of
unsafe vegetation adjacent to these power lines.
That concludes my remarks today, and I look forward to
answering any questions you have.

[The prepared statement of Mr. French follows:]
Prepared Statement of Christopher French, Deputy Chief, United States
Department of Agriculture, Forest Service
on H.R. 3299, H.R. 3283, and H.R. 6012

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and Members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on
several bills pertaining to the USDA Forest Service. We defer to the
U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) for its views on those elements
of the bills that would affect federal lands under its jurisdiction.
H.R. 3299, ``DIGITAL Applications Act''

H.R. 3299 would require DOI and USDA each to establish an online
portal to accept and process applications for communications use
authorizations and to notify the Assistant Secretary of Commerce of the
availability of the online portal.
USDA recognizes the Forest Service's important role in permitting
critical infrastructure that provides communications services,
including broadband, to the American people. USDA fully supports the
bill's establishment of an online portal to accept and process
proposals and applications for communications use authorizations, and
the Forest Service has already started developing digital permitting
services.
Until recently, a proposal or application for a communications use
was submitted by email or through regular mail to the local Forest
Service office. A longstanding goal of the Forest Service has been to
automate this process by developing and deploying enhanced digital
permitting services.
As an interim solution, the Forest Service recently created a
publicly available online portal for submission of communications use
proposals and applications (available at: https://www.fs.usda.gov/
managing-land/special-uses/communications-uses/fiber-optic-cable). The
portal allows the agency to track communications use proposals and
applications at the national level, thus providing an additional level
of oversight. Meanwhile, the Forest Service is investing in more robust
digital permitting services that will include several features, such as
the ability for proponents to submit and track their proposals and
applications online and digitally sign their authorizations.
To promote the goal of more robust digital permitting services, the
Forest Service has obtained additional skills and capacity through an
agreement with the General Services Administration's Technology
Transformation Services (known as GSA 18F). This effort will support
research and customer engagement to enhance the digital permitting
services' utility, functionality, and user interface. The enhanced
digital permitting services will promote efficiency in processing all
proposals and applications, reliability of proponent and agency data,
and agency transparency and accountability. All these enhancements will
significantly improve customer service and satisfaction.
USDA recently received funding from the Federal Permitting
Improvement Steering Council to support the Forest Service's
development and deployment of enhanced digital permitting services. Our
efforts to enhance digital permitting services can be complemented by
the agency's use and expanded availability of categorical exclusions
(CEs) we have adopted under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, such CEs C-4
through C-8 concerning new communications uses, including broadband,
from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration;
and CEs A-4 (communication towers) and A-6 (fiber optic cable) from the
Department of Commerce.
USDA supports the intent of H.R. 3299 and would like to work with
the bill sponsors and Committee to offer technical assistance given the
Department's ongoing efforts to develop and fund enhanced digital
services and to address concerns about the Department of Commerce
notification requirement.
H.R. 3283, ``Facilitating DIGITAL Applications Act''

H.R. 3283 would require the Assistant Secretary of Commerce to
submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on whether
DOI and USDA have established online portals to accept and process
applications for communications use authorizations.
USDA is already working toward establishing an online portal to
accept and process applications for communications use authorizations
and welcomes Congress's interest in this endeavor.
As an interim solution, the Forest Service recently created a
publicly available online portal for submission of communications use
proposals and applications (available at: https://www.fs.usda.gov/
managing-land/special-uses/communications-uses/fiber-optic-cable). The
portal allows the agency to track communications use proposals and
applications at the national level, thus providing an additional level

the bill sponsors and Committee to offer technical assistance given the
Department's ongoing efforts to develop and fund enhanced digital
services and to address concerns about the Department of Commerce
reporting requirements.
H.R. 6012, ``Fire Safe Electric Corridors Act of 2023''

H.R. 6012 would grant the Secretary of Agriculture authority to
allow electric utilities operating on National Forest System (NFS)
lands under a special use authorization to cut and remove vegetation
within the vicinity of their authorized powerline facilities without
requiring a separate timber sale. Any vegetation management conducted
under this authority would have to be consistent with the applicable
land management plan and applicable environmental laws and regulations.
USDA supports the intent of the H.R. 6012 and appreciates
Congress's efforts to facilitate more efficient management of powerline
facility rights-of-way on NFS lands. Current forest management
authority allows for disposal of some timber associated with vegetation
management for powerline facilities and other administrative uses
without a separate timber sale. Our existing authority is limited by
the Agency's overall maximum cutting volume and does not directly
address disposal of felled hazard trees in or adjacent to a powerline
facility right-of-way without a separate timber sale.
USDA looks forward to working with the Committee and bill sponsors
to fully realize the bill's intention of addressing the limitations in
Forest Service's existing authority. We are interested in a clear
authority to cut and dispose of hazard trees in or adjacent to
powerline facility rights-of-way that would not require a timber sale
or need to compensate the federal government. We would like to work
with the committee to ensure that the authority to cut and dispose of
hazard trees along power line ROWs is clear and that the disposal of
hazard trees is not subject to valuation and timber sale requirements.

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Deputy Chief French. I would now
like to introduce Mr. Mike Caldwell, Associate Director for
Park Planning Facilities and Lands at the National Park
Service.
Associate Director Caldwell, you have 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF MIKE CALDWELL, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, PARK PLANNING,
FACILITIES, AND LANDS, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, WASHINGTON, DC

Mr. Caldwell. Chairman Tiffany and members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the
Department of the Interior's views on two of the bills on
today's agenda. I would like to submit our full statements for
the record and summarize the Department's views.
I would also like to submit a statement for the record for
two other bills, H.R. 3299, the Deploying Infrastructure with
Greater Internet Transactions and Legacy Applications Act; and
H.R. 3283, the Facilitating the Deployment of Infrastructure
with Greater Internet Transactions and Legacy Application Act.
This statement was prepared by the Bureau of Land Management,
and we would request that any questions about these bills be
referred to them.
H.R. 7976 would re-designate the Civil War Defenses of
Washington as the Civil War Defenses of Washington National
Historical Park. These defenses were a ring of forts and
buttresses that encircled the capital city as a safeguard from
invasion by Confederate troops, and made Washington the most
heavily fortified city in the world at the time. The park would
include the 19 National Park Service sites that are currently
associated with the Civil War Defenses of Washington.
H.R. 7976 would allow the National Park Service to
affiliate with any site in the District of Columbia, Virginia,
and Maryland that is associated with the Civil War Defenses of
Washington for possible inclusion in the park, and provide the
option to purchase these properties.
The bill would also direct a study and report of the
history of the Civil War to consider ways these stories could
be conveyed for the benefit of the public.
The Department recognizes the important contribution to
America's story that is represented by the Civil War Defenses
of Washington sites, and supports the bill's goal to expand the
public's understanding of the significance of the Defenses of
Washington and the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1864. However,
rather than designating the sites as a standalone National Park
Service unit, the Department believes the current management
system effectively protects the existing resources while
affording interpretive education and recreational opportunities
across the sites.
The National Park Service continuously seeks ways to
collaborate with local governments and stakeholder groups to
elevate public awareness and appreciation of these special
places. If the Committee decides to act on this legislation, we
would like to have the opportunity to work with the bill's
sponsor and the Committee on amendments.
H.R. 8012 would designate Jackie Robinson Ballpark in
Daytona Beach, Florida as a national commemorative site. The
bill would also add the site to the African American Civil
Rights Network, and it would authorize a special resource study
of the Jackie Robinson Ballpark.
The Department views the achievements and legacy of Jackie
Robinson, who paved the way for integration in the national
sport of baseball, as an important and inspiring story in our
nation's history, and supports authorizing a special resource
study of the Jackie Robinson Ballpark. The Department
recommends deferring action on designating the ballpark as a
national commemorative site until after the special resource
study is completed, and recommendations for preservation and
interpretation of the site are submitted to Congress.
We also recommend pursuing inclusion of the site on the
African American Civil Rights Network through previously
authorized administrative process, rather than adding it
through H.R. 8012.
The special resource study authorized by H.R. 8012 would
provide an opportunity for the National Park Service to
evaluate the Jackie Robinson Ballpark and make recommendations
to Congress about whether it would be a good candidate for
inclusion in the National Park System, while also considering
alternatives for preservation, protection, and interpretation
of the site by other governmental or non-governmental entities.
Designating the site as a national commemorative site prior to
completing the study would be premature. A special resource
study would provide valuable information in determining how
best to designate and manage the ballpark to recognize Jackie
Robinson and his incredible legacy.
The Department recommends amending H.R. 8012 to authorize a
special resource study to be completed within 3 years of
funding being made available, rather than 2. We would be happy
to work with the Committee and the sponsor on amendment
language.
Mr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony. I am happy to
answer any questions that you or other members of the
Subcommittee may have.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Caldwell follows:]
Prepared Statement of Michael A. Caldwell, Associate Director, Park
Planning, Facilities and Lands, National Park Service,
U.S. Department of the Interior
on H.R. 7976 and H.R. 8012

H.R. 7976

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the Department
of the Interior's views on H.R. 7976, the Civil War Defenses of
Washington National Historical Park Act.
The Department recognizes the important contribution to America's
story that is represented by the Civil War Defenses of Washington sites
and supports the bill's goal to expand the public's understanding of
the significance of the Defenses of Washington and the Shenandoah
Valley Campaign of 1864. However, rather than designating the sites as
a stand-alone unit of the National Park System, the Department supports
maintaining the existing comprehensive system of parks that interpret
the historic forts and also provide recreation opportunities, preserve
substantial tracts of forests, and protect water resources in and
around the Nation's Capital.
H.R. 7976 would redesignate the Civil War Defenses of Washington as
the Civil War Defenses of Washington National Historical Park. The park
would include the National Park Service (NPS) sites that are currently
associated with the Civil War Defenses of Washington. H.R. 7976 would
also allow the NPS to affiliate with any site in the District of
Columbia, Virginia, and Maryland that is associated with the Civil War
Defenses of Washington for possible inclusion in the park; it would
further provide the NPS with the option to purchase these properties
from willing sellers. The bill would also direct a study and report of
the history of the Civil War to consider what ways these stories could
be conveyed for the benefit of the public.
The Civil War Defenses of Washington are historically significant
to the Nation for being instrumental to the protection of Washington,
DC, during the Civil War. At that time, a ring of forts and buttresses
encircled the capital city as a safeguard from invasion by Confederate
troops. It was composed of 68 forts supported by 93 detached batteries
and 20 miles of rifle pits. In record time, the Union built a fort
system that made Washington, DC, the most heavily fortified city in the
world.
The remaining federally owned sites originally were to have been
connected by a Fort Circle Drive in accordance with the 1902 McMillan
Commission Report. The drive was not completed, and the forts and
parcels of land purchased for the drive were divided among Rock Creek
Park, National Capital Parks-East, and the George Washington Memorial
Parkway to manage. Today, the NPS manages 19 Civil War fort sites in
the District of Columbia, Virginia, and Maryland. Other sites are
managed by local governments in Maryland and Virginia while the rest
have been torn down or lost to other purposes. The NPS preserves the
historical integrity of the fort remnants that are an important part of
the Capital's rich Civil War history, and these sites also function as
community parks and a greenbelt of open space for outdoor recreation
for the benefit of residents and visitors.
Because the Civil War defenses are spread across three NPS units,
the NPS has developed a management system to coordinate across park
boundaries within our existing staffing and funding capacity. A Civil
War Defenses of Washington program manager and two rangers provide
education, interpretation, event planning, and program coordination for
all 19 NPS sites. The Department believes this management system
effectively protects the existing resources while affording
interpretive, education, interpretive, and other opportunities across
the sites. The NPS continuously seeks ways to collaborate with local
governments and stakeholder groups to elevate public awareness and
appreciation of these special places.
If the Committee decides to act on this legislation, we would like
to work with the bill sponsor and the Committee on amendments that
would align the bill's language with that Congress typically uses for
other legislation authorizing new units of the National Park System,
including referencing a legislative map. We would also like to discuss
whether the study that would be authorized by this bill could be
tailored to meet more specific goals.
Chairman Tiffany, this concludes my statement. I would be happy to
answer any questions that you or the other members of the Subcommittee
have.

H.R. 8012

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the Department
of the Interior's views on H.R. 8012, a bill to establish Jackie
Robinson Ballpark National Commemorative Site in the state of Florida,
and for other purposes.
The Department views the achievements and legacy of Jackie Robinson
as an important and inspiring story in our nation's history and
supports authorizing a special resource study of the Jackie Robinson
Ballpark in Daytona Beach, Florida, as provided for in H.R. 8012. The
Department recommends deferring action on designating the ballpark as a
national commemorative site until after the special resource study is
completed and recommendations for preservation and interpretation of
the site are submitted to Congress. We also recommend pursuing
inclusion of the site on the African American Civil Rights Network
through the previously authorized administrative process, rather than
adding it through H.R. 8012.
H.R. 8012 would designate Jackie Robinson Ballpark as a national
commemorative site. The bill would also add the site to the African
American Civil Rights Network, a program managed by the National Park
Service (NPS). Additionally, the bill would authorize a special
resource study of the Jackie Robinson Ballpark to assess its national
significance, suitability, and feasibility for establishment as a unit
of the National Park System, and consider alternatives for
preservation, protection, and interpretation of the Site by Federal,
State, or local government entities, or private and nonprofit
organizations.
Jackie Robinson, the son of South Georgia sharecroppers, made
history by breaking the race barrier in Major League Baseball (MLB) as
the first African American to play in a regularly scheduled MLB
professional game in the modern era. On March 17, 1946, he played his
first exhibition game at Daytona Beach's City Island Ball Park in
Florida. His remarkable performance, including a stolen base and a run
scored, captured the nation's attention. Robinson challenged
segregation in both presence and performance and paved the way for
racial integration in the national sport of baseball. He went on to win
the National League's pennant and Rookie of the Year honors and became
the first African American player inducted into the Baseball Hall of
Fame. His legacy transcended the sport of baseball, and he continued to
serve as an ardent civil rights activist until his death in 1972.
In 1990, the City Island Ball Park, along with the associated ball
field and grandstand, was renamed Jackie Robinson Ball Park--a tribute
to his impact on baseball and the nation's fight for racial equality.
The special resource study authorized by H.R. 8012 would provide an
opportunity for the NPS to evaluate the Jackie Robinson Ballpark for
its potential for inclusion in the National Park System, consider
alternatives for preservation, protection, and interpretation of the
site by federal, state, or local government entities, or private and
nonprofit organizations, and report these findings to Congress.
Designating the site as a national commemorative site prior to
completing the study would be premature. A special resource study would
provide valuable information in determining how best to designate and
manage the ballpark to recognize Jackie Robinson and his legacy.
Furthermore, the Department has concerns about the use of the term,
``national commemorative site,'' since the term has no definition by
law or custom and the public may be confused about its significance.
The NPS is aware of only three examples where Congress has used this
designation: the Quindaro Townsite National Commemorative Site in
Kansas, the Kennedy-King National Commemorative Site in Indiana, and
the Charleston High School National Commemorative Site in Arkansas. The
NPS recommends that Congress define the term along with a programmatic
context prior to designating any new national commemorative sites.
Additionally, legislative designation of the Jackie Robinson
Ballpark as part of the African American Civil Rights Network would
circumvent an established administrative process that ensures that all
nominated properties meet the network's criteria.
The Department recommends amending H.R. 8012 to authorize a special
resource study to be completed within three years of funding being made
available, rather than two. We would be happy to work with the
Committee and the sponsor on amendment language.
Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement. I would be pleased to
answer any questions that you or other members of the Committee might
have.

Questions Submitted for the Record to Mr. Mike Caldwell, Associate
Director--Park Planning, Facilities, and Lands, National Park Service,
Department of the Interior

Mr. Caldwell did not submit responses to the Committee by the
appropriate deadline for inclusion in the printed record.

Questions Submitted by Representative Westerman

Question 1. In his testimony, Deputy Chief Chris French of the U.S.
Forest Service (USFS) stated that USFS supports the intent behind H.R.
3283 and H.R. 3299 and acknowledges the need for an online portal
system to process communications use authorizations for USFS-
administered lands.

1a) Does the BLM similarly acknowledge the need for creating an
online portal system to process communications use authorizations for
BLM-administered lands? Please explain why or why not.

1b) If not, by what alternative means would the BLM seek to improve
its current application-processing system?

Question 2. In his testimony, Mr. Romano indicated that online
portals should ``not only facilitate the submission of applications,''
but should ``also provide greater visibility into the status of such
applications--including identification of where they stand in terms of
review and any items that might be deemed as lacking or missing in the
submission.''

2a) Does the BLM agree that, to be effective, an online portal
should have features that enable an applicant to track the status of
their applications for communications use authorization? If so, please
explain how the BLM would plan to create these features.

2b) If not, please explain how the BLM would otherwise work to
ensure that applicants have more transparency regarding the status of
their applications.

Question 3. In his remarks to the Committee on H.R. 8012, Associate
Director Michael Caldwell of the National Park Service (NPS) stated
that the Department of the Interior (DOI) ``recommends deferring action
on designating the [Jackie Robinson Ballpark] as a national
commemorative site until after the special resource study is completed
and recommendations for interpretation and preservation and
interpretation of the site are submitted to Congress.'' Associate
Director Caldwell also explained that the DOI recommends that H.R. 8012
be amended to give the DOI three years, rather than two, to complete
the special resource study authorized by the legislation.

3a) Why does the DOI need a full three years to complete the
special resource study?

3b) Has the NPS ever completed a special resource study in less
than 3 years? If so, please list instances when this has occurred.

Question 4. In its Statement for the Record, the BLM states that
the agency ``place[s] a high priority on working with applicants on
their proposed [rights-of-way (ROW)] to process the application
expeditiously'' and ``strives to provide ROW applicants a decision
within 60 days from the receipt of the completed application.'' In a
report dated April 10, 2024, however, the U.S. Government
Accountability Office (GAO), observed that roughly half of the
communications use applications submitted to the BLM during fiscal
years (FY) 2018 to 2022 either exceeded the 270-day statutory deadline
or lacked sufficient data to conclude whether the deadline had been
met.

4a) What explains these failures by the BLM to meet the statutory
deadline and achieve its own goals for ``expeditiously'' processing
requests for commercial use authorizations?

4b) Please describe, in detail, all steps that the BLM has taken to
address the deficiencies highlighted in the GAO report cited above.

Question 5. In response to questioning from Chairman Tiffany,
Deputy Chief French stated that the USFS is already investing heavily
in a digital permitting system to improve the approval process of
requests for communications use authorizations.

5a) Please describe all efforts currently underway at the BLM to
develop or use digital systems to process and approve requests for
communications use authorizations.

5b) If no such efforts are underway, please explain why not.

Question 6. During his testimony, Associate Director Caldwell
stated that the DOI supports H.R. 7976's goal to increase public
understanding of the Civil War Defenses of Washington (CWDW). However,
Associate Director Caldwell explained that, rather than designating the
sites as a standalone NPS unit, the DOI believes that current
management system, under which the CWDW are spread across three NPS
units, ``effectively protects the existing resources while affording
interpretative, education . . . and other opportunities across the
sites.'' Which other NPS units are currently managed under a cross-unit
management system?

Question 7. In his testimony, Michael Romano, Executive Vice
President of NTCA--The Rural Broadband Association (NTCA), described
the considerable difficulties that small, community-based
telecommunications and broadband services providers face when working
with federal authorities. Mr. Romano declared that ``NTCA members can
share many `lessons learned' regarding permitting processes that are
inefficient, outdated, understaffed, or simply not working otherwise as
intended.''

7a) Is the BLM aware of this general perception among rural
broadband providers? Does the BLM acknowledge that applying for
communications use authorizations on BLM-administered land is often a
lengthy and difficult process?

7b) Does the BLM regularly solicit feedback from broadband
providers about their experiences in trying to obtain communications
use authorizations on BLM-administered land? If so, please describe
that process.

7c) If not, will the BLM commit to establishing a system for
soliciting and obtaining such feedback?

Question 8. In his testimony, Mr. Romano shared the concern of many
NTCA members that ``the delays and costs that already exist within
permitting processes will only grow as efforts to deliver on universal
broadband connectivity ramp up in coming years.''

8a) Does the BLM share this concern? Why or why not?

8b) What does the BLM plan to do to address this problem? Please
provide concrete steps.

Question 9. During the hearing, Chairman Tiffany asked how the NPS
would ensure that private property rights and local decision making
would be protected alongside the creation the National Historical Park
proposed by H.R. 7976. In response, Associate Director Caldwell said
that preserving the affiliated sites would be sufficient to respect
private property rights. Using specific examples, please elaborate on
how the NPS's affiliated sites preserve private property rights.

Question 10. In his testimony, Associate Director Caldwell stated
that ``NPS continuously seeks ways to collaborate with local
governments and stakeholder groups to elevate public awareness and
appreciation of these special places [within the CWDW].''

10a) Please provide a few examples of how NPS has gone about this.

10b) Are certain concerns commonly raised by these groups? If so,
please describe those concerns.

Question 11. Broadband developers have reported that deploying the
necessary communications facilities on federal land often takes years
to complete, largely due to the complex permitting system imposed by
federal land management agencies.

11a) Is the BLM concerned that the significant delays and costs
associated with its current permitting and application systems are
dissuading many broadband providers from even applying for
communications use authorizations in the first place? Please explain
why or why not.

11b) Does the BLM agree that the significant delays and costs
associated with its current permitting and application systems are more
likely to cause greater harm to small broadband providers than to their
larger competitors? Please explain why or why not.

11c) Does the BLM believe that the regulatory requirements it
imposes on applicants for communications use authorizations contribute
to the disparity in broadband access that is commonly referred to as
the ``digital divide''? Please explain why or why not.

Question 12. In its Statement for the Record, the BLM explained
that, despite supporting the goals of H.R. 3299, the agency believes
that the one-year timeframe the legislation establishes for creating
the online portal ``is not achievable given current resources.''

12a) Given that the USFS has already established an interim online
portal and has not raised concerns about H.R. 3299's timeline, why does
the BLM believe it cannot meet the deadline?

12b) According to Mr. Romano, the workflows that federal agencies
will encounter in reviewing communications use authorizations ``likely
will become more overwhelming'' in the next few years, which ``could
lead to even greater delays and costs.'' Given this dynamic, wouldn't
the BLM be better served by establishing an online portal as quickly as
possible?

Question 13. Associate Director Caldwell's testimony states that,
if H.R. 7976 were to be advanced in Committee, the NPS would ``like to
discuss whether the study that would be authorized by [H.R. 7976] could
be tailored to meet more specific goals.'' Please describe in greater
detail the ``more specific goals'' that the NPS would like the study to
be aimed at achieving.

Question 14. In his testimony, Mr. Romano stated that delays and
costs associated with lengthy processing of applications for
communications use authorizations ``can be confounding,'' especially
when the applicant proposes merely to install facilities in
``previously disturbed terrain.'' As an example of this, Mr. Romano
mentioned that applications to make a simple switch from copper wiring
to fiber in existing ROWs still take a long time to process.

14a) Does the BLM agree that this indicates that its current
application-processing system is flawed? Please explain why or why not.

14b) Does the BLM have any proposals for streamlining its review of
applications for maintaining, updating, or repairing existing
communications facilities on previously disturbed terrain? If so,
please describe those proposals in detail. If not, please explain why
not.

Question 15. The BLM states that it ``added the ability to submit
SF-299 applications for communications use'' online in June 2023. What
prompted the BLM to institute this change?

Question 16. The BLM admits in its Statement for the Record that
its existing online portal handles only the submissions of Standard
Form 299 (SF-299) applications for communications use, whereas the
applications are processed and ultimately approved or rejected by staff
working offline.

16a) In his testimony, Mr. Romano recounted how NTCA members have
struggled to identify the proper agency personnel to contact for
questions regarding their applications. Does the BLM believe that the
offline processing of these applications is more efficient than using
an online portal? Please explain why or why not.

16b) According to testimony from Deputy Chief French, the USFS is
``investing in more robust digital permitting services that will
include several features, such as the ability for proponents to submit
and track their proposals and applications online . . .'' Does the BLM
have similar plans to move more of its application processing online?
If so, please describe those plans. If not, please explain why not.

Question 17. Associate Director Caldwell's testimony on H.R. 8012
states that the NPS would prefer that the Jackie Robinson Ballpark be
added to the African American Civil Rights Network ``through the
previously authorized administrative process, rather than adding it
through H.R. 8012.''

17a) Please explain why the NPS takes this position.

17b) Please provide an estimate of the amount of time it would take
to add the Jackie Robinson Ballpark to the African American Civil
Rights Network through ``the previously authorized administrative
process.''

Question 18. In his testimony, Mr. Romano stated that many NTCA
members have reported that ``permitting offices and agencies can fall
silent for long stretches of time regarding the status of
applications'' after the initial submission. Further, these ``episodes
of silence'' are often followed by repeated data requests that would
have been easier for applicants to have addressed at the beginning of
the process.

18a) Please describe all steps that the BLM is currently taking to
ensure that applicants for communications use authorizations have
greater visibility into their application status and are more promptly
informed of any additional information they need to provide for their
applications to be fully processed.

18b) Does the BLM believe that an online portal could help resolve
these issues? If not, please describe the BLM's alternative solution.

Questions Submitted by Representative Moylan

Question 1. Associate Director Caldwell, can you please speak on
any ongoing projects and efforts by the National Park Service to help
facilitate the connection of our rural communities, especially those in
the Pacific?

Question 2. What actions can be taken by Congress to make these
efforts more effective?

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Associate Director. I will now
recognize Mr. Michael Romano, Executive Vice President of NTCA,
the Rural Broadband Association.
Mr. Romano, you have 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF MICHAEL ROMANO, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, NTCA,
THE RURAL BROADBAND ASSOCIATION, ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA

Mr. Romano. Chairman Tiffany, members of the Subcommittee,
thank you for the opportunity to testify. My testimony focuses
upon two bills: H.R. 3283, the Facilitating Digital
Applications Act; and H.R. 3299, the Digital Applications Act.
I am appearing today on behalf of more than 850 community-
based broadband providers serving the most rural parts of the
country. Despite facing typical densities of about six
locations per square mile and having fewer than 30 employees on
average, these small businesses have deployed cutting-edge
broadband networks that rival anything available in urban areas
today. These network deployment efforts have provided
substantial experience with permitting on Federal lands, among
other rights-of-way. At the same time, these providers have
more to do to upgrade their remaining customers, and they are
actively engaged in expanding their networks to reach unserved
locations in other areas, giving them a substantial interest,
as well, in finding ways to make permitting procedures more
efficient.
We are grateful for the chance to share some of these
experiences and to highlight how H.R. 3283 and H.R. 3299 can
help in providing greater access and transparency in
applications to place broadband facilities on Federal lands.
NTCA is thankful to Representatives Miller-Meeks and Cammack,
respectively, for sponsoring these bills, and to
Representatives Dingell and Matsui, respectively, for showing
bipartisan support for them.
In many rural areas, providers often have no choice but to
install networks that touch BLM, National Park Service, or
Forest Service property. Re-routing even just a small portion
of a project can be infeasible due to massive distances,
impassable terrain, or the inability to access private land if
any happens to be nearby. My testimony shared examples of
challenges that providers have faced in obtaining approvals to
deploy broadband networks. Such concerns could become even more
severe, however, as private investment ramps to meet increasing
broadband demand, and as the largest broadband funding program
in our nation's history prepares to launch.
The broadband related bills under consideration today
tackle an important piece of the broader permitting puzzle,
specifically, how providers seek permission to deploy broadband
networks on Federal lands using Form 299. My testimony includes
data from a GSA report that tracks activity related to Form
299. I won't go into this data in detail as part of the opening
remarks, but suffice to say they show that more applications
are being submitted than approved each quarter, and that a
backlog is therefore growing. The GSA report also highlights
some of the challenges that Federal property managing agencies
encounter even just in databasing the substantial paperwork.
NTCA members report that Form 299 itself is relatively
straightforward to complete, although, to be clear, subsequent
levels of environmental and historical review take
significantly more work and time. But the lack of an online
portal has led at times to frustration, confusion, and delay.
For example, one NTCA member reported difficulty in identifying
the proper agency personnel for receipt of an application.
Obviously, an online portal would mitigate such concerns.
Similarly, another member indicated that the use of an
online portal for state-level permitting has made it more
efficient to track progress, highlighting the promise of such
an approach at the Federal level, as well. H.R. 3283 would
prompt the creation of such a portal by directing the Commerce
Department to consult with Interior and Agriculture to submit a
report to Congress regarding creation of a portal. H.R. 3299
would compel the Interior and Agriculture Departments to create
such online portals within a year.
We support both of these bills and we encourage the
Subcommittee to advance them. In closing, I want to highlight a
few other related issues raised in my written testimony.
First, I cannot emphasize enough growing concerns about the
workforce needed to process permit applications. NTCA members
commonly report that Federal agencies and other permitting
offices are overwhelmed by what is already before them. As tens
of billions of dollars flow into much-needed broadband
deployment efforts in the next few years, these concerns will
likely be exacerbated. Even as an online portal will be a much
welcomed improvement in Federal land permitting processes, the
promise of such a portal could be undermined if there are
insufficient skilled eyeballs on the other side of that portal
to promptly process the information received.
Second, any online portal should not only receive Form 299,
but also facilitate better communication. NTCA members report
that permitting agencies can fall silent for stretches of time
after applications are submitted. These episodes of silence can
be followed by serial requests for additional information. NTCA
hopes that any online portals created will not only facilitate
the initial submission of applications, but also provide
greater visibility into their status and identification of open
issues still to be resolved.
Thank you for providing NTCA with the opportunity to share
these thoughts on behalf of its rural, community-based
broadband provider members. We look forward to working with
this Subcommittee, other Members of Congress, the Federal
agencies of jurisdiction, and other stakeholders to realize and
sustain our nation's shared vision of universal broadband
access.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Romano follows:]
Prepared Statement of Michael Romano, Executive Vice President, NTCA--
The Rural Broadband Association
on H.R. 3283 and H.R. 3299

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, Vice Chairman Curtis, and
members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify
at this legislative hearing. My testimony today will focus upon two
bills--H.R. 3283, ``Facilitating the Deployment of Infrastructure with
Greater Internet Transactions and Legacy Applications Act'' or the
``Facilitating DIGITAL Applications Act,'' and H.R. 3299, ``Deploying
Infrastructure with Greater Internet Transactions and Legacy
Applications Act'' or the ``DIGITAL Applications Act.''
I am Michael Romano, the Executive Vice President of NTCA--The
Rural Broadband Association. I oversee NTCA's public policy, government
affairs, and business development initiatives, the educational mission
of the Foundation for Rural Service, and several areas of internal
association operations. My prior work experience and educational
background are detailed in the curriculum vitae provided to the
Subcommittee. My remarks today are on behalf of the NTCA membership,
which consists of over 850 small community-based providers of
telecommunications and broadband services in some of the hardest-to-
serve parts of rural America across 45 states. Despite having
approximately 6,000 customers on average over thousands of square
miles, facing typical densities of approximately six locations per mile
(less than the entire State of Montana), and operating with an average
of fewer than 30 employees, these providers have deployed advanced
networks in deeply rural spaces; NTCA's latest survey indicates that on
average more than 80% of members' customers have fiber connections and
100 Mbps symmetrical broadband service levels or greater.
This good work has not been easy, however. It has taken
extraordinary effort by these providers to serve their neighbors,
friends, and family--and this work rests atop a unique mix of
commitment to their communities, entrepreneurial spirit, and effective
governmental policies and programs that help make and sustain the
business case for investing and continuing to operate networks in
deeply rural areas. Moreover, it is worth noting that for all this
compelling progress, there is more to be done. Even as more than 80% of
NTCA members' rural customers on average can receive service that
rivals what many urban and suburban users enjoy, and even as this
percentage continues to climb year after year, much work remains to
deliver the same high levels of service to the remaining customers.
And, in rural areas not fortunate enough to be served historically by
community-based providers like those in NTCA's membership, the picture
is less promising still--in these other areas, far more rural Americans
long for the kind of broadband access needed to participate
meaningfully in an increasingly online world.
NTCA members' progress in upgrading networks in their own
historical serving areas over the past several years is remarkable, and
they have been proactive in seeking to expand into rural markets
traditionally served by larger providers as well. As just one example,
NTCA members collectively have been among the most active applicants
for, and among the largest recipients of, ReConnect program funding
through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (``USDA''). Looking forward,
I expect that many NTCA members will seek to participate in the
Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (``BEAD'') program. In short,
NTCA members are leaving no stone unturned in seeking to improve
connectivity in small towns and unincorporated areas across rural
America--even beyond their historical footprints.
But this brings us to this important hearing. Based upon this
extensive history of network deployment--upon not only the federal
lands that are under the purview of this Subcommittee, but also along
interstate, state, and local roadways, under railroad crossings, on
poles, and/or in private rights-of-way--NTCA members can share many
``lessons learned'' regarding permitting processes that are
inefficient, outdated, understaffed, or simply not working otherwise as
intended. We are grateful for the chance to share some of these
experiences, and to highlight how H.R. 3283 and H.R. 3299 can help in
providing greater access and transparency with respect to the process
of applying to place broadband facilities on federal lands--and
ultimately in expediting such broadband deployment. NTCA is thankful to
Representatives Miller-Meeks and Cammack, respectively, for sponsoring
these bills, and to Representatives Dingell and Matsui, respectively,
for showing bipartisan support for these bills as original co-sponsors.
As context for why measures like these are so important, I will
first provide a few brief examples from rural network deployments to
highlight how permitting processes can affect the achievement of
universal broadband. NTCA members are particularly concerned that the
delays and costs that already exist within permitting processes will
only grow as efforts to deliver on universal broadband connectivity
ramp up in coming years. After discussing these examples, I will
discuss how H.R. 3283 and H.R. 3299 would help in addressing an
important part of these processes. Finally, I will highlight a few
additional considerations for Congress in relation to permitting.
EXAMPLES OF BROADBAND PERMITTING ISSUES

NTCA members across the nation indicate that our country's
broadband availability and affordability goals could be undermined by
inefficient or ineffective processes to apply for and obtain permits
for network deployment. This appears to be a shared concern for
providers of all kinds--large and small, rural and urban, wireline and
wireless.

Obtaining access to federal lands for broadband facilities
installation--or otherwise obtaining a permit when a project is
considered a ``major federal action'' under the National Environmental
Policy Act (``NEPA'') and/or a ``federal undertaking'' pursuant to the
National Historic Preservation Act (``NHPA'')--is a common concern of
rural providers. Given the nature of the areas these providers serve,
they often have no choice, for example, but to install fiber under a
road touching Bureau of Land Management (``BLM''), National Park
Service, or Forest Service property, as re-rerouting even just a small
portion of a project may be infeasible due to substantial distances,
impassible terrain, or the inability to obtain easements on privately
held land (if any is nearby). (It is also worth noting that providers
must comply with NEPA and NHPA processes even if they are not
installing facilities on federal lands; for example, if the deployment
is funded by a ReConnect or BEAD grant, providers must adhere to NEPA
and NHPA regardless of whether the project is on federal lands.)
Members recount delays of up to two years in some cases to apply for
and obtain permissions to build. Indeed, even if a project touches
federal land for only a short distance as part of a larger deployment
(or not at all in some cases), the entire project can still be delayed
by the need to obtain approvals for the part under an agency's purview.
As just a few brief examples to provide context:

One NTCA member sought to place fiber under a road on BLM
land. The project was meant to improve redundancy and
reliability of the operator's network, and the portion
touching BLM land was a small percentage of the overall
project. The initial permit application was not accepted as
complete for nearly a year, however, during which time the
provider received sequential requests for additional
information.

Another NTCA member utilized ReConnect funding to connect
consumers via fiber in a rural area. Although the entire
project was in a previously disturbed right-of-way and
subject to a NEPA ``Categorical Exclusion'' (the most
streamlined level of NEPA review), the provider was not
granted final approval to begin construction and receive
funds for 9 months. This resulted in an even greater delay
than that, however, as the project is in a part of the
country where frozen ground prevents construction for
approximately 5 months of the year--meaning construction
could not commence for another several months thereafter.

One member experienced significant delays receiving
permits for two separate projects funded by the ReConnect
program. In each case, the projects were primarily in
previously disturbed terrain, but historical preservation
and consultation processes under NHPA nevertheless took
approximately two years to complete.

Another NTCA member was informed that final release of
ReConnect grant funds would require securing more than two
dozen wetlands permits, which could not be obtained without
submitting more detailed engineering and network design
plans, even as such plans were already included in the
ReConnect grant application in the first instance.

An NTCA member reports having to plan for phases of a
construction project so that any work on U.S. Forest
Service lands will be undertaken last because of a lack of
sufficient staffing in the agency to process the voluminous
amount of information required in connection with
environmental reviews; in turn, these delays have made
already-difficult parts of the projects even more expensive
due to inflationary impacts as calendar quarters and years
go by awaiting approval.

As these examples highlight, NTCA members and providers like them
can face lengthy delays--and the need to expend substantial sums beyond
the actual costs of deployment--to access federal lands or other
rights-of-way for broadband infrastructure installation. Especially in
the case of installation of facilities in previously disturbed terrain,
delays in application processing can be confounding and
counterproductive to upgrading of existing networks. NTCA members have
serious concerns that, without proactive planning and concrete action,
issues of this kind could become more severe as private investment
ramps to meet ever-increasing broadband demand--and as the largest
broadband deployment funding program in our nation's history prepares
to launch to amplify and augment these private sector efforts.
H.R. 3283 AND H.R. 3299

The broadband-related bills under consideration today aim to tackle
an important piece of the permitting puzzle--how providers apply for
and obtain permission to deploy networks on federal lands.
Specifically, Form 299 (SF-299) was created by the General Services
Administration (``GSA'') pursuant to a 2012 mandate from Congress for a
common application to install, construct, or maintain certain
communications facilities on federal property. A report prepared for
the third quarter of 2023 by GSA indicated the following activity in
recent quarters across federal property-managing agencies related to
Form 299 submissions:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6224.003

.epsSource: GSA, Executive Order 13821, ``Streamlining and
Expediting Requests to Locate Broadband Facilities in Rural America,''
Q3 FY 2023 Quarterly Report (available at: https://www.gsa.gov/system/
files/Executive_Order_13821_Quarterly_Report_Q3FY23.pdf)

Data such as these underscore the importance of processing
applications as efficiently as possible, with dozens of applications
authorized each quarter but far more submitted and more still under
consideration from prior quarters. Moreover, this same GSA report
indicated (at page 7) that BLM, which is ``typically responsible for
80% of the volume of reported applications,'' had switched to a new
record-keeping system ``that may have contributed to field offices
having challenges querying their databases'' and ``likely resulted in
fewer applications being reported than are present in their
inventory.''
NTCA members report that Form 299 itself is relatively
straightforward to complete (even as subsequent layers of environmental
and historical preservation review can take much more work and time as
noted in the examples I shared earlier). But the lack of an online
portal for submission has led at times to frustration, confusion, and
apparent delay. For example, one NTCA member reported concern in
identifying the proper Forest Service personnel to whom to route an
application; obviously, an online portal would mitigate unnecessary
delays and confusion in this regard. Similarly, another member has
indicated that the use of an online portal in connection with State-
level permitting processes has yielded efficiencies in tracking
progress of review and approval, highlighting the promise of such an
approach at the federal level as well.
H.R. 3283 would help to prompt the creation of such an online
portal by directing the Department of Commerce to consult promptly with
the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture (the two most
significant property-managing agencies in NTCA members' experience) and
then to submit a report to Congress within 90 days regarding the status
of efforts in those agencies to create an online portal for submission
of Forms 299 and any barriers thereto. Meanwhile, H.R. 3299 would take
the additional step of compelling the Interior and Agriculture
departments to create such online portals within one year. NTCA
supports both H.R. 3283 and H.R. 3299, and we encourage the
Subcommittee to advance these bipartisan measures as important steps in
improving the effectiveness of Form 299 and ultimately making it easier
for providers and property-managing agencies alike to process broadband
deployment applications.
ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

Before ending my testimony, I wanted to address a few other matters
related to the ultimate effectiveness of any online portals and the
streamlining of permitting processes generally.
First, I had the privilege to testify last year before the
Subcommittee on Communications and Technology of the House Committee on
Energy and Commerce. That hearing reviewed a few dozen bills aimed at
streamlining permitting issues to expedite broadband deployment. It is
useful to highlight one particular aspect of that testimony here
related to the definition of ``communications facility,'' which is
drawn from the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 and
is cited in the legislation before us today (H.R. 3283 and H.R. 3299).
While the section of the 2012 law in which it appears is entitled
``Wireless Facilities Deployment,'' and while a good portion of that
section speaks to the placement of wireless towers or base stations,
the definition of a ``communications facility installation'' is
expressly defined to include ``wireline transmission'' as well. I raise
this here again simply to underscore that it will remain important for
all parties--from Congress to the property-managing agencies to
providers--to recall that provisions seeking to improve online
application processes or to streamline permitting otherwise must apply
with equal force to wireline and wireless deployments alike.
Second, I would be remiss in discussing the processing of
applications if I did not raise concerns about the workforce needed to
fulfill these obligations. NTCA members have seen firsthand that
federal agencies and other permitting offices are overcome by the
requests and applications before them now, leading to the kinds of
delays described above. One NTCA member, for example, shared that BLM
had only two staff people to process applications in a large western
state--and this was for access not only for communications uses, but
for oil and gas extraction as well. As tens of billions of dollars flow
into much-needed broadband deployment efforts in the next few years,
the workflows to review permit applications likely will become more
overwhelming and could lead to even greater delays and costs. In
addition to improving the technology by which applications can be
submitted and processed, we must ensure that these agencies and offices
have the resources and skill sets needed to meet this demand. The
promise offered by an online portal will be undermined if there is
insufficient trained and skilled agency staff on the receiving end to
process those applications.
Finally, any online portal should be designed not only to receive
Forms 299 in the first instance, but also to facilitate better
communication among stakeholders regarding the status of them. NTCA
members report that permitting offices and agencies can fall silent for
long stretches of time regarding the status of applications or what
else might be needed to deem an application ``complete,'' despite
repeated inquiries by providers and their engineers and contractors.
These episodes of silence can be followed at times by serial requests
for additional information that could have been caught earlier or
avoided altogether with better guidance and communication upfront. This
dynamic in turn undermines the purpose of the ``shot clock''
established by federal law for review and approval of applications
because the application is not deemed complete and thus subject to a
mandatory 270-day review period until much longer after filing. NTCA
therefore hopes that any online portals created will not only
facilitate the submission of applications, but that they will also
provide greater visibility into the status of such applications--
including identification of where they stand in terms of review and any
items that might be deemed as lacking or missing in the submission.
Thank you again for providing NTCA with the opportunity to share
these thoughts on behalf of its rural community-based broadband
provider members. We look forward to working with this Subcommittee,
other Members of Congress, the federal agencies of jurisdiction, and
other stakeholders to realize and sustain our nation's shared vision of
universal broadband access.

Questions Submitted for the Record to Mr. Michael Romano, Executive
Vice President, NCTA--The Rural Broadband Association

Questions Submitted by Representative Moylan

Question 1. Mr. Romano, can you please discuss actions Congress can
take to support localbroadband development and deployment in rural
areas, especially in island communities?

Answer. I thank Delegate Moylan for this question and for the
opportunity to provide thoughts regarding further steps that Congress
can take--in addition to passing the two bills (H.R. 3283 and H .R.
3299) that NTCA supported at this legislative hearing--to facilitate
broadband deployment on federal lands and in other rural areas,
including especially island communities.
As an initial matter, I had the privilege of testifying in April
2023 before the Communications and Technology Subcommittee of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee at a hearing entitled ``Breaking
Barriers: Streamlining Permitting to Expedite Broadband Deployment.''
In my testimony at that hearing, I highlighted a number of issues that
providers far too frequently face in deploying broadband in rural areas
(including specifically federal lands) and spoke in support of several
still-pending bills that could help address these concerns.
For example, I shared in my prior testimony that obtaining access
to federal lands for broadband facilities installation--or otherwise
obtaining clearances pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act
(``NEPA'') and/or the National Historic Preservation Act (``NHPA'') is
a common concern for rural providers. Given the nature of the areas
these providers serve and the significant distances between customer
locations and network points of presence, rural providers often have no
choice but to cross a Bureau of Land Management road or touch Forest
Service property, for example. Yet the process of obtaining permissions
through the environmental, historic preservation, and other
consultation processes required by NEPA and NHPA can take many months
or even years to complete; the myriad overlay of federal (including
military in some places like Guam), state, and local regulatory regimes
complicate this even further. While federal agencies have undertaken
commendable efforts in recent months to attempt to streamline these
processes through ``program comments'' and ``categorical exclusions,''
these measures do not always apply, and providers and agencies alike
may not even be fully aware when such relief is available. Thus, bills
like the ``Reducing Barriers for Broadband on Federal Lands Act'' (H.R.
3297) and the ``BROADBAND Leadership Act'' (H.R. 3295) would likely be
very useful to expedite deployments by giving more meaning to ``shot
clocks'' that govern permit review and providing clearer and consistent
exemptions from the most stringent layers of review for certain kinds
of projects.
Relatedly, we often hear from small rural providers--including
network owners in Guam and other island communities--particular
frustration with the process for upgrading existing network facilities
in existing rights-of-way. As I mentioned at this legislative hearing
on July 9, it makes little sense to require providers to jump through
significant hoops simply to replace one technology with another in an
existing right-of-way where there is previously disturbed terrain. This
concern is both a deterrent to upgrading networks in the ordinary
course of business to deliver better services to consumers, and it can
be of even greater importance and impact when a provider is looking to
restore existing networks on islands like Guam that can from time to
time contend with severe weather such as typhoons. Especially given the
desire for resilient networks (and particularly in areas like Guam
where mission-critical networks serve strategic national interests),
the ability to upgrade plant in existing rights-of-way with buried
infrastructure that can even better withstand natural disasters should
be seen as an essential aspect of improvements to permitting processes.
We would also submit that Congress could play an important role by
ensuring that the fees associated with permitting and use of public
rights-of-way are reasonable and do not saddle the relatively fewer
customers in rural areas with even higher costs for deployment. One
example of legislation that could address this concern is the ``BEAD
FEES Act'' (H.R. 3298), which would, at least in the context of the
upcoming Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (``BEAD'') program,
prompt states and territories to ensure that fees for access to public
rights-of-way and other areas necessary for deployment of BEAD-funded
projects will be cost-based and publicly disclosed.
Finally, as I mentioned at the July 9 legislative hearing, even the
best streamlining measures still depend ultimately upon sufficient
resources in terms of skilled staff within federal, state, and local
permitting agencies to process applications promptly. As the hearing
reinforced, many of these agencies already face a growing backlog of
applications--and as programs like BEAD are poised to inject tens of
billions of dollars more into much-needed broadband deployment--these
backlogs are likely only to grow unless smart streamlining is paired
with attention to the skilled workforce needed at all levels of
government to make sure the streamlining works as intended and
designed. We would urge Congress to probe further into these concerns
as well, so that any legislation adopted to improve permitting
procedures can in fact realize its promise.

Mr. Jaworski, you have 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF JIM JAWORSKI, GENERAL MANAGER, DAYTONA TORTUGAS,
DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA

Mr. Jaworski. Chairman Tiffany and members of the
Subcommittee, my name is Jim Jaworski, General Manager for the
Daytona Tortugas professional baseball team, Single-A affiliate
of the Cincinnati Reds located in Daytona Beach, Florida. This
is my 15th year with the organization, and I am honored to be
here with you today. Thank you for the invitation, and a
special thanks to Representative Waltz. Today, I am here to
talk about Jackie Robinson and a historic event that took place
in Daytona Beach.
Baseball has been played on City Island Daytona Beach since
1914, making it the third oldest active professional baseball
field in the United States, only behind Wrigley Field and
Fenway Park. On March 17, 1946, Jackie Robinson broke the
professional baseball modern-era color barrier when he stepped
to the plate at then-City Island Ballpark, later to be named
Jackie Robinson Ballpark, in Daytona Beach as a Montreal Royal,
the Brooklyn Dodgers' top farm club, in an inter-squad game
against the Dodgers. This historic event took place at what is
now called Jackie Robinson Ballpark, and was largely made
possible by the local advocacy of Mary McLeod Bethune, founder
of Bethune-Cookman University, with the local city commission.
On that Sunday morning in Daytona Beach, Black churchgoers
listened to sermons about Robinson before heading to the
ballpark hand in hand. Dodgers officials invited African
American veterans from an Army hospital to attend a game. These
veterans, about 250 in number, sat wherever they wanted for the
game, disregarding the segregation of the bleachers. Thus,
before the game even began, City Island Ballpark was
integrated.
One year after his debut, Robinson began his Major League
Baseball career in Brooklyn, demonstrating that African
American players could excel in the League. He led in stolen
bases, won the National League Rookie of the Year, and later
earned the Most Valuable Player title. He made six all-star
appearances and secured a World Series victory in 1955. His
achievements swiftly earned him induction to the Baseball Hall
of Fame in 1962.
In 1990, City Island's historic field was renamed Jackie
Robinson Ballpark, and features a statue of Robinson behind
home plate. The statue portrays Robinson passing a baseball to
two young children, symbolizing his enduring impact on future
generations. Each year on Jackie Robinson's Major League
Baseball debut anniversary, baseball honors his monumental
contributions. In 1997, then-Commissioner Bud Selig retired
Robinson's number 42 across Major League Baseball in a ceremony
before a Dodgers Mets game.
In addition to the number 42 being retired in Daytona
Beach, we also have retired Robinson's number 9, worn during
his time in Daytona Beach. On April 15, all of Major League
Baseball honors Robinson by wearing the number 42. In a similar
way, the Daytona Tortugas honor Robinson and commemorate the
events of the barrier-breaking game by wearing the number 9. In
2022, Minor League Baseball launched The Nine, an initiative
and outreach program celebrating Black baseball pioneers and
civil rights leaders, named after Robinson's Minor League
number in Daytona Beach.
As we look forward to continuing to champion Jackie's
legacy in Daytona Beach and across the country, the passage of
H.R. 8012, the Jackie Robinson Commemorative Site Act, would be
of enormous benefit to this effort and our community.
Designating Jackie Robinson Ballpark as a national landmark
would provide even more opportunities to showcase all he did
for the game and for bettering the communities in which we
live.
To this day, the home plate at Jackie Robinson Ballpark
stands in the same spot that it did on that historic day in
1946. Every year, hundreds of athletes step up to the plate
into Jackie Robinson's footsteps. This story continues at
Jackie Robinson Ballpark as the HBCU Bethune-Cookman
University's baseball team continues to practice and play their
games at the ballpark. This is a partnership that Mary McLeod
Bethune, recently memorialized in Statuary Hall, would
certainly be proud of.
As a Single-A affiliate for the Cincinnati Reds, Jackie
Robinson Ballpark continues to be the first step for Minor
League players, and a memorable one at that. As we take Jackie
Robinson Ballpark into the future, our goal is to preserve the
history that took place on the grounds and showcase it for
years to come. The ballpark is currently undergoing roughly $30
million of improvements to ensure that baseball will be played
for generations to come in Daytona Beach. This private-public
effort is being led by Mayor Derrick Henry, City Manager Deric
Feacher in Daytona Beach, the club and leaders from the
Cincinnati Reds, and Major League Baseball. These improvements
are transformational for us, and envisioned to include a Jackie
Robinson Museum on site.
A National Landmark designation will further increase
visibility and traffic to the ballpark, making the local
economic impact of the park even more compelling. Jackie
Robinson Ballpark is so much more than baseball, and as Jackie
famously once said, ``A life is not important except in the
impact it has on other lives.'' The national landmark status
and passing of the Jackie Robinson Commemorative Site Act would
only help cement this philosophy through shining a light on his
life for generations to come. Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Jim Jaworski, General Manager, Daytona Tortugas
on H.R. 8012

My name is Jim Jaworski, General Manager for the Daytona Tortugas
Professional Baseball Team, Single-A Affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds
located in Daytona Beach, Florida. This is my 15th year with the
organization, and I am honored and extremely excited to be here with
you today. Thank you for the invitation.
Today, I am here to talk about Jackie Robinson and a historic event
that took place in Daytona Beach. Baseball has been played on City
Island in Daytona Beach since 1914 making it the third oldest, active
professional baseball field in the United States only behind Wrigley
Field and Fenway Park.

STATEMENT OF JOE QUINN, VISIONARY NETWORK MEMBER, NATIONAL
SEPTEMBER 11 MEMORIAL AND MUSEUM, NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK

Mr. Quinn. Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and
members of the Committee, thank you for allowing me to testify
today on H.R. 5401, the 9/11 Memorial and Museum Act. Thank you
to the Committee for your support in the past, and thank you to
Representatives D'Esposito and Goldman for your continued
support.
H.R. 5401, sponsored by Representative D'Esposito, is an
important piece of legislation that will ensure the Federal
Government partners with the 9/11 Memorial and Museum for its
ongoing protection, safety, and security for its millions of
annual visitors from across the country and across the world.
My name is Joe Quinn. I am a 9/11 family member and a
military veteran. During my senior year at the United States
Military Academy at West Point, 9/11 happened. I remember that
day like it was yesterday, seeing the Twin Towers burning at
the top like smokestacks from my television.
My brother, Jimmy, worked on the top floor of the North
Tower. My brother was everything to me. He wasn't only just my
brother, but he was also my best friend. During the 1993
bombing of the World Trade Center, my brother and I were just
teenagers with our entire futures ahead of us. We really didn't
understand why someone would attack the World Trade Center,
nonetheless why they would attack it again, providing a false
sense of security when my brother would accept his first job
out of college in finance with Cantor Fitzgerald at just 23
years old. My brother Jimmy would tell people that he worked on
top of the world, and that is how he felt until it all came
crashing down on September 11, 2001.
From my room at West Point, I watched the North Tower
collapse with my brother inside of it. The next day, I made my
way down to Manhattan. I made my way to as close to ground zero
as possible before being stopped by a police officer who told
me I couldn't go through. I told him my brother was in there.
We both stared at the fire, smoke, and rubble, and knowingly
said nothing to each other. We both knew my brother couldn't be
in there.
That day, I vowed to never let something like this happen
again. So, after graduating West Point I was commissioned as an
officer in the United States Army, doing two tours in Iraq as a
soldier and one tour in Afghanistan as an advisor. After
getting out of the Army, I studied terrorism at Harvard
University, and then became an instructor at West Point's
Combating Terrorism Center. And one of my greatest takeaways
from that period of study is the importance of symbolism for
targets of terrorism.
While it didn't make sense to me as a teenager, it now made
sense to me why terrorists would attack the World Trade Center
in 1993 and then again in 2001. It is because the World Trade
Center was a symbol of freedom, economic power, and the power
of our diversity as a nation where every race, religion, and
creed was attacked on 9/11, to include citizens from more than
90 countries.
The site of the World Trade Center, the 9/11 Memorial and
Museum, will continue to be a target not only because it
represents our strength and our diversity, but it now
represents our resilience and unity as a country.
Twenty-three years later, I still struggle with the loss of
my brother. It is not only that he was killed, it was how he
was killed. I picture him being scared. He was asthmatic and
scared of heights. As the smoke billowed up, he had to peer
down 102 stories and choose between smoke inhalation and
jumping to his own death. And I couldn't do anything to protect
him.
Twenty-three years later, I am now living back in New York
City with my family. I followed my brother's footsteps, working
in finance for the firm called Drexel Hamilton, where we have
the mission of hiring veterans, and where I bring veterans to
the 9/11 Memorial on a monthly basis. I am also lucky enough to
be married to a Gold Star family member, where my wife's oldest
brother was killed in Iraq. We have three wonderful kids, 7, 5,
and 3 years of age, where we take them to the 9/11 memorial
often to visit their Uncle Jimmy, since his remains were never
found.
In conclusion, I was humbled when asked to testify today,
but I hesitated because life is busy, especially with three
little kids. And today is my 13th wedding anniversary, so I am
in a bit of trouble on the way home.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Quinn. But I am here because I didn't want to be the
one who didn't support this 9/11 bill. I failed to protect my
brother. But collectively, we can protect the children,
veterans, and millions of our fellow citizens going forward,
and preserve the 9/11 Memorial Museum as a beacon of national
unity.
Thank you for your support for this important piece of
legislation, and thank you for honoring America's promise to
never forget. Thank you.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Quinn follows:]
Prepared Statement of Joe Quinn
on H.R. 5401

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and Members of the
Committee, thank you for allowing me to testify today on H.R. 5401, the
9/11 Memorial & Museum Act. Thank you to this Committee for your
support in the past, and thank you to Representatives D'Esposito and
Goldman for your continued support and for providing testimony today.
One-third of the U.S. population was too young to remember or has
been born since 9/11/01. That's 100 million Americans having no lived
memory of the worst terrorist attack in history--a day that changed our
lives forever.
H.R. 5401, the 9/11 Memorial and Museum Act, sponsored by
Representative Anthony D'Esposito, is an important piece of legislation
that will ensure the federal government partners with the Memorial &
Museum for the ongoing protection, safety, and security of the 9/11
Memorial and Museum, it's millions of annual visitors, and its staff.
The 9/11 Memorial and Museum is considered a high-value target by
malicious actors and terrorist groups.
My name is Joe Quinn. I'm a military veteran and member of the 9/11
Memorial community. During my senior year at the United States Military
Academy at West Point, 9/11 happened. I remember that day like it was
yesterday, with my roommate Joe Peppers calling out to me, saying,
``Joe, turn on the TV, the Twin Towers are on fire.'' I turned on the
television to see the towers burning at the top like smokestacks. Then
my phone rang. It was my mother. She said, `Are you watching this?
We're at war. You're at West Point and we're now at war,'' not even
thinking of the safety of my brother Jimmy who worked for Cantor
Fitzgerald on the 102nd floor of the North Tower.
My brother Jimmy was everything to me: my best friend on top of
being my brother. We were bunkbed mates in our shared room of our home
in Brooklyn, New York.
During the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, my brother and I
were just teenagers with our entire futures ahead of us. We really
didn't understand why someone would attack the World Trade Center,
nonetheless why they would attack it again, providing a false sense of
security when my brother would accept his first job out of college with
Cantor Fitzgerald at just 23 years-old.
My brother Jimmy would tell people that he worked on ``Top of the
World,'' and that's how we felt, until it all came crashing down on
September 11th, 2001.
From my television set in my room at West Point, I watched the
North Tower collapse with my brother inside of it, and I collapsed to
the floor with it. My roommate Joe Peppers picked me up off the floor,
and I eventually made my way out of my room and down to Ground Zero the
next day.
I made my way as close to Ground Zero as possible before being
stopped by a police officer who told me I couldn't go through. I told
him my brother was in there. We both stared at the fire, smoke, soot
and rubble and knowingly said nothing to each other. We both knew my
brother couldn't be `in there.'
That day I vowed to never let something like this happen again, so
after graduating West Point, I was commissioned as an officer in the
United States Army--doing two tours in Iraq as soldier and eventually a
tour in Afghanistan as a civilian advisor.
After getting out of the Army, I'd study terrorism at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government and then became an Instructor at West
Point's Combating Terrorism Center, and one of my greatest takeaways
from that period of study is the importance of symbolism for targets of
terrorism.
While it didn't make sense to me as a teenager, it now made sense

then again in 2001. It's because the World Trade Center was a symbol of
freedom, economic power and the power of our diversity as a nation--
with every race, religion and creed being attacked on 9/11 to include
citizens from more than 90 countries.
The site of the World Trade Center--the 9/11 Memorial & Museum--
will continue to be a target, not only because it represents our
strength and diversity, but it now represents our resilience and unity.
23 years later, I still struggle with the loss of my brother,
Jimmy. It's not only that he was killed, but it was how he was killed.
I picture him being scared. He was asthmatic and scared of heights. As
the smoke rose, he had to peer down 102 stories and choose between
smoke inhalation or jumping to his death, and I couldn't do anything to

23 years later, I'm now back living in New York City with my
family. I've followed my brother's footsteps working in finance, for
the firm, Drexel Hamilton, where we have a mission of hiring veterans,
and where I bring veterans to the 9/11 Memorial on a monthly basis.
I'm also lucky enough to be married to a Gold Star family member,
where my wife's oldest brother was killed in Iraq. We have three
wonderful kids now--7, 5 and 3 years of age, where one of them is named
after his uncles--and who we take to the 9/11 Memorial often to visit
their Uncle Jimmy, since his remains were never found.
How much is it worth to protect my children and the thousands of
children who visit the 9/11 Memorial every year?
How much is it worth to protect my parents and the 8,000 9/11
family members who gather at the Memorial every year?
How much would we give to protect more than 77 million visitors
from every state in the U.S., from all walks of life, from 175
countries that have visited over the last 10 years--including tens of
thousands of active, retired and veterans who visit every year?
If you close your eyes, and remember how you felt on September
11th, 2001, then the answer is simple.
I'd give anything for my brother to be alive, but I've learned the
hard way that there's nothing I can do for him now, after failing to
protect him.
But there's something I can do now, there's something we can all do
now, to protect our children, to protect our veterans, and to protect
our fellow citizens from terrorist's number one target--the 9/11
Memorial & Museum site--where we can protect its legacy as place of
healing, resilience and unity.
Thank you for your support for this important piece of legislation
and thank you for honoring America's promise to Never Forget.
9/11 Memorial & Museum

The 9/11 Memorial & Museum remembers and honors the 2,983 people
killed in the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001 and the February
26, 1993 World Trade Center bombing, as well as those who risked their
lives to save others and all who demonstrated extraordinary compassion
in the aftermath of the attacks. It fulfills this mission through
commemoration, exhibitions, and education. Since its dedication on
September 11, 2011, the 9/11 Memorial has welcomed 77 million visitors
from all 50 states and 175 countries; and the Museum has welcomed more
than 23 million individuals since its dedication on May 15, 2014.
In the middle of the World Trade Center site is the 9/11 Memorial
plaza, eight acres dedicated to remembering every individual killed on
September 11, 2001, the six individuals killed as a result of the
terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center on February 26, 1993, and
all who are sick or have died as a result of exposure to toxins at and
around the attack sites during the recovery efforts post-9/11, and
those who have become sick or have died due to exposure to toxins
during recovery efforts at the three 9/11 attack sites. Anchoring the
plaza are two twin reflecting pools with waterfalls, each about an acre
in size and set within the footprints of the original Twin Towers. The
Memorial is a powerful reminder that visitors are standing on the
physical site where the attacks occurred.
Situated 70 feet below the plaza and within the archaeological
heart of the World Trade Center site, the 9/11 Memorial Museum is
comprised of 110,000 square feet of exhibition and public space. It
tells the story of 9/11 and its continuing significance through
multimedia displays, archaeological excavations, in situ historical
remnants, artifacts, recorded testimonies, and compelling narratives.
The Museum houses two core exhibitions. In the footprint of the
North Tower is the historical exhibition, which presents the events of
September 11, 2001 as they unfolded that day, the historical
antecedents leading up to the attacks, and the recovery efforts and
acts of compassion, volunteerism, and public service evidenced in the
days, months, and years following the attacks. The Museum's memorial
exhibition, In Memoriam, located in the South Tower footprint, tells
the personal stories of the nearly 3,000 individuals who were killed in
the terrorist attacks of 2001 and 1993. Other galleries are dedicated
to changing exhibitions, or special installations related to 9/11 and
the World Trade Center site. The Museum also offers a slate of
educational and public programming that fulfills the institution's
mission. The primary goals of these programs are to accurately convey
what happened on 9/11 and in its aftermath, to connect audiences to the
human impact of the attacks, and to underscore the ongoing relevance of
the attacks today. The Museum is an active collecting institution,
caring for more than 75,000 objects.

Memorial: We are the proudly designated custodian responsible for
monitoring a site with extraordinarily complex infrastructure and
mechanical systems that require constant attention: 24 hours a day,
seven days a week, 365 days a year. The continuous operation and
maintenance of the Memorial plaza and Museum is of utmost importance,
ensuring through the highest standard of care that it can exist in
perpetuity.
The 9/11 Memorial & Museum was consciously designed and constructed
to incorporate sustainable practices for a healthy, efficient, carbon-
and cost-saving green facility. The 9/11 Memorial was awarded LEED Gold
Certification in July 2015 based on sustainable design elements and
practices that address the impact of the site's carbon footprint,
including optimized energy usage, water conservation and storm water
management, as well as a heat island effect with green roof and
landscaping. The eight-acre site has ample public green space,
including over 400 swamp white oak trees and 45,750 square feet of
groundcover. Existing sustainability and green practices include a
green roof that sits on layer of structural soil, which allows
landscaping, including trees, groundcover, and grass, to grow freely
without being confined to planters. Additionally, during non-drought
conditions, 100% of the landscape irrigation demand is met by a storm
water harvesting system, whereby rain that falls on the plaza flows to
four harvest tanks where the water is filtrated for landscaping
purposes.

Security: In 2024, the 9/11 Memorial remains one of the busiest
tourist sites in New York City and, as such, safety for the thousands
of daily visitors is of the utmost importance, representing one of the
institution's highest annual expenses. Furthermore, with the 9/11
Memorial & Museum situated at a site that was the target of two
terrorist attacks, it remains a site of significant risk. The 9/11
Memorial security staff, working in coordination with local, state, and
federal law enforcement, is responsible for the safety and security of
all who visit the Memorial.
Security personnel are stationed on the plaza to monitor visitors'
behavior, including possible damage to Memorial parapets; from walking
through protected areas; ensuring animals and pets do not enter the
Memorial grounds; and enforcing the site's list of prohibited items and
rules regarding unauthorized media and expressive activity on the
plaza. Simultaneously, other on-duty security personnel are posted
throughout the Museum interior screen visitors entering the Museum to
ensure all guests comply with TSA style (e.g., x-ray, magnetometer)
screening; safekeep of exhibitions and individual artifacts on display;
and monitor the loading dock and employee entrance according to
industry standards.

Education: 9/11 Memorial & Museum currently offers a diverse slate
of programs which aim to accurately convey what happened on 9/11 and in
its aftermath, to connect our audience to the human impact of the
attacks, and to underscore their ongoing relevance today. Inquiry-based
and interdisciplinary, they provide an accurate historical
understanding and foster the critical thinking skills and empathy
required to tackle this challenging content. Key programs include:

9/11 Anniversary Digital Learning Experience (DLE):
Offered annually on the Anniversary, this commemorative
program (formerly known as Anniversary in the Schools)
introduces students and teachers from around the world to
9/11 through first-person accounts of the attacks and their
aftermath and a live chat with Museum staff. For many
students, this is their first time learning about 9/11. For
many educators, the program serves as an introduction to
our work and mission. In 2023, 22% of participating
students were in elementary school, 41% in middle school,
and 37% in high school. To date, the DLE has reached over
3.2 million individuals from all 50 states and 60
countries, with ample room to grow.

9/11 Memorial & Museum Field Trips (In-Museum/Virtual):
Our inquiry-based field trips introduce 9/11 and its
aftermath through guided tours. To convey this history, the
programs focus on the stories of those affected and draw
from the Museum's permanent collection of more than 21,500
artifacts. An increased investment in education will enable
outreach to specific target markets across the country.

Professional Development for Educators (PD): We offer a
diverse slate of programs to help elementary, secondary,
and pre-service educators teach 9/11 in their classrooms.
Our Educator Conference Series invites educators into the
Museum, providing interdisciplinary tools and strategies
for teaching this challenging content. In summer 2023, we
launched the Institute for Educators bringing educators
from around the country for a more in-depth weeklong
experience. Museum staff also regularly delivers
professional development sessions to education conferences
around the country. Presentations focus on current topics
within the social studies, civic education, and 9/11
scholarship. Our research estimates that for every teacher/
educator we reach, they in turn teach anywhere from 30-150
students.

Digital Education Toolkit: We currently offer a range of
online resources for educators and learners, including
interactive lesson plans, the 9/11 primer, digital
exhibitions, and interactive timelines. Funding will assist
Education staff in expanding these offerings for students
and teachers; for example, by creating additional lesson
plans geared toward these grades and supporting the filming
and archiving of Professional Development workshops on our
website.

Youth and Family Programs: We offer a variety of programs
for visitors with children. All activities use age-
appropriate language to help children learn more about 9/11
and how people responded to the attacks. Current programs
include the 9/11 Memorial Art Cart, 45-minute Youth &
Family Tours of the Museum, and art-based Activities at
Home.

9/11 Memorial & Museum's Mission

The National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade
Center bears solemn witness to the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001 and February 26, 1993. Respecting this site made sacred through
loss, the Memorial & Museum remembers and honors the nearly 3,000
victims of these attacks and all those who risked their lives to save
others. It further recognizes the thousands who survived and all who
manifested extraordinary compassion and leadership in the wake of the
attacks. Demonstrating the consequences of terrorism on individual
lives and its impact on communities at the local, national, and
international levels, the Memorial & Museum attests to the triumph of
human dignity over human depravity and affirms an unwavering commitment
to the fundamental value of human life.

May the lives remembered, the deeds recognized, and the spirit
reawakened be eternal beacons, which reaffirm respect for life,
strengthen our resolve to preserve freedom, and inspire an end to
hatred, ignorance, and intolerance.

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Mr. Quinn, for your testimony. That
concludes our panelists' testimony. We are going to move on to
questions from Committee members.
First, I would like to recognize the gentleman from
Minnesota, Mr. Stauber, for 5 minutes of questions.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and Mr. Quinn, thank you
for your testimony.
Mr. D'Esposito, thanks for your professional service as a
law enforcement officer. As one of just a few myself that have
worn the uniform, I can assure you we will never forget.
As a Representative of Minnesota's 8th Congressional
District, I understand the importance of broadband access for
rural America. That is why I am proud to support the
legislation brought by my colleagues that will improve the
permitting of rural broadband technology and infrastructure on
Federal lands.
Mr. Romano, can you go into greater detail on why having an
online portal for Form 299 submissions will help expedite this
permitting process?
And without this online portal, how is a provider supposed
to submit this necessary paperwork?
Mr. Romano. Thank you, Congressman, for the question.
The way that the form is submitted today, it could be any
number of ways physically. It is USPS, UPS, Fed-Ex, or you can
do it by e-mail, as well.
The legislation that is before you would help in several
ways. I can think of four in particular. The first is to allow
you to figure out where to send it, to make sure you can get it
to the right place in the agency. The second is to get a
confirmation of receipt, instead of having an e-mail or
something go to essentially a blank post office box, and not
knowing where it ends up. Third is to track the status of the
application, hopefully, and figure out where that stands in the
process of review and approval. And the fourth is to enable
communication back and forth with the permitting agency to
understand if there are any questions.
Mr. Stauber. And I think that is important for the people
submitting the Form 299, that they understand where it is at,
and what position it is at, and when they are going to get an
answer, et cetera.
So, Mr. Romano, absent this portal, there may be a
completely different process virtually every time a provider
needs to submit a Form 299, as you just said. It can be
completely different, based on which Federal land manager they
are seeking approval from or which field office or national
forest or park system unit they are seeking to construct
necessary infrastructure on.
Do you think, as far as a permitting reform, do you think
that it will streamline and be easier for not only the agency,
but the applicants, as well?
Mr. Romano. Certainly, yes. The form is common, but the
process is not necessarily common. Each agency has its own way
of administering these things and reviewing these things. I am
not sure of every agency's processes, but I know, for example,
for the Bureau of Land Management, they have field offices and
units that handle information. I heard from a member in one
Western state there were two people involved in the processing
of communications facilities, gas pipelines, and other
facilities on BLM land. So, there are different processes by
different agencies.
I would hope that an online portal could be used not only,
again, for submission and receipt, but also for some
commonality and streamlining in the review across different
agencies. Each agency will have its own needs and challenges,
to be sure, but hopefully this would lend itself to greater
commonality across all of those.
Mr. Stauber. And I want you to repeat it for the public.
Without this online portal, how is a provider supposed to
submit this necessary paperwork? You mentioned some. Repeat
those.
Mr. Romano. Sure. I have heard tell of U.S. Postal Service,
UPS, Fed-Ex, and e-mail, just in inquiring in the last several
days with members about different ways they have sent it in.
Mr. Stauber. And this is a good bill to streamline that.
And we are talking about permitting reform. And this is
incredible. I don't think any type of infrastructure investment
enjoys such broad, bipartisan support than rural broadband
infrastructure. But our permitting system, it is so backwards
we can't even make these investments because of the permitting
system. And this is directly affecting rural communities like
those in northern Minnesota.
One more, Mr. Romano. I agree with you that we need to
increase transparency around the permitting process for rural
infrastructure investments, and creating a public online portal
for Form 299 submissions is one of the easiest, most
straightforward things we can do. That said, we know this is
just the start of what has to be done. Mr. Romano, does
frivolous litigation pose a significant challenge for rural
broadband providers to build and invest in rural broadband
infrastructure?
Mr. Romano. Congressman, I have certainly heard of
litigation in other contexts related to placement of facilities
or environmental clearances and the like. Our members are small
businesses. They can't afford to engage in litigation, and
oftentimes they need to get a project done quickly because they
are serving their neighbors, their friends, their family. So,
they tend not themselves to engage in litigation on this. They
look to find ways to make this work and get it through.
Improving those processes will be incredibly important for all
of these reasons.
Mr. Stauber. And we hear that, unfortunately every week in
this Committee, where litigation halts good projects or delays,
and tends to be more expensive because of the delay. We need
permitting reform, and we need reforms to the judicial review
process to be part of that, as well.
I thank all of you for your testimony today.
And Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields. I now turn to the
gentlelady from Oregon for 5 minutes of questioning.
Ms. Hoyle. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
First of all, Mr. Quinn, I want to thank you. I know it is
difficult, and it is so meaningful that you are here, you share
your experience, and that we never forget what happened.
I was in Germany on 9/11 and had family members that were
firefighters on the scene. We didn't know for days whether or
not they were alive. I have a cousin who still has lung damage,
as he searched for survivors that just weren't there. So, we
can't forget. And, again, I am sorry for your loss, and I just
want to thank you. This is critical and important.
But that is not what I came to speak about. So, with that,
I would like to speak in support of H.R. 6012, the Fire Safe
Electrical Corridors Act from my colleague, Representative
Carbajal. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation.
As we speak, western Oregon is in the middle of a record
heat wave. Today in Eugene, Oregon, it is set to peak at 104
degrees. This is not normal. There is also a red flag warning
in place due to increased fire risk throughout the Willamette
Valley and central Oregon. I have the fire map that I look at
every morning. From the time I looked at it yesterday morning
until the afternoon, there were 10-fold more fires that had
started. And we haven't even gotten into the lightning season
yet.
So, I want to thank the first responders who are out there
in this 100-plus-degree heat, working to keep our communities
safe. My constituents are very aware of the threat of
wildfires, we have our to-go bags ready and packed at all
times, and in particular the wildfire risk that power lines can
create on Federal lands.
In 2020, during the historic Labor Day fires, we had seven
mega-fires at the same time. The Archie Creek Fire just west of
me, caused by power lines, burned over 125,000 acres and
devastated communities in my district.
We have learned a lot. Utilities in Oregon have been
working hard to fireproof their infrastructure to prevent
future disasters, and it is in all of our best interests to
reduce the red tape to make it easier for utilities to reduce
wildfire risk from power lines. We cannot allow bureaucracy to
get in the way of saving lives in our communities, which is why
I strongly support this bipartisan bill to allow utilities to
remove hazard trees near power lines on Federal lands without
going through the timber sale process. This is bipartisan. This
is good legislation, and it is a common-sense solution to a
serious issue.
I want to thank my colleagues who supported it,
Representative Carbajal for bringing it forward, and I urge my
colleagues to support the bill. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. Thank you for your questions and comments. And
now I recognize Mr. D'Esposito for 5 minutes of questioning.
Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And Mr. Quinn, thank you again for being here today, not
only on behalf of your family, but for all the families of the
victims of 9/11 and, like I mentioned in my opening remarks,
the victims who are still being taken from 9/11.
And I have to say that this questioning, at least for me,
it seems sort of ridiculous, because we know the answers to it,
and we know how important the 9/11 Museum is to not only New
Yorkers, but to Americans and, quite frankly, to people from
across the world. But I want to get some of these answers on
the record, because I think it is important to our colleagues
and those who perhaps have in the past not always been
supportive of the efforts that we have had in New York on
behalf of the 9/11 Memorial.
So, why do you believe that it is so important that we
continue to educate future generations about the attacks on
September 11, 2001?
Mr. Quinn. No, I appreciate that, and a great question.
As a military veteran, I actually just spoke to a group of
ROTC cadets, and the core of my talking points about military
service was based on the first question of where were you on 9/
11, and everyone was sheepish. I thought it was just a shy
class until a brave cadet raised his hand and said, ``Sir, we
weren't born yet.'' And for me, emotionally, as you could
probably see, to me it feels like yesterday every day in my
life. And I think for many Americans it feels that way. So, to
think that it has been 23 years, we sometimes assume that we
are still on the forefront of preventing threats in downtown
New York, particularly around the World Trade Center and the 9/
11 Memorial Museum. But it remains a high value target for many
reasons.
And then second of what I just said as far as people tend
to forget. And it is not their fault. About 100 million
Americans either weren't born or are too young to remember that
day. So, to have a museum remember not what happened that day,
but how we reacted, the resilience, the unity we had as a
country, the reminder, but also have those educational programs
that teach the next generation what happened that day and what
we need to do to continue to prevent threats and the emotional
tie and the resilience we have all experienced on September 12
as Americans.
Mr. D'Esposito. I know that you mentioned that not only do
you take regular visits to the museum, but you have brought
people from your firm and veterans to the museum. And,
obviously, over the years since it has been open, some of the
initiatives have changed, some of them have remained the same,
some of them have expanded.
If you could, just tell us a little bit about some of the
initiatives you think that have gone on at the museum that are
so critical, or ones that we know about that are in the
planning stages that will obviously be beneficial to this
funding in this bill.
Mr. Quinn. Definitely. One of the reasons I mentioned my
story is that I came back to New York. I am raising my family
in New York City. So, when I take my 3-year-old, my 5-year-old,
who is named after his uncle, and my 7-year-old, we go to the
Memorial Museum, and visit the pools, and to see their Uncle
Jimmy on a consistent basis. So, I see the security, I see the
need for the security in an open plaza. And then, just as we
came in here there was security, you need security into the
museum.
And then, I can't stress this enough, the importance of the
9/11 Memorial Museum to military veterans. I have seen more
veterans cry just showing up there and letting out such emotion
for being there, because it was the impetus for service for
millions and millions of Americans from all 50 states of
America that joined the military and come back, and have that
connection to it.
So, whether it is events, educational programs, or just the
experience of the museum, you said yourself with the Virgil
quote, it is just something that needs to be preserved and
protected for the long haul.
Mr. D'Esposito. I was going to ask you what you thought the
benefits were to Americans and those that live outside the New
York City area. But you have answered the question in totality,
and I think it is clear that this memorial, this museum serves
as a beacon, and it serves individuals who were not directly
affected by 9/11, those who perhaps are being affected by 9/11
now, but I think you just made a great point, men and women who
left the safety and security of this beautiful country to fight
for something greater, to defend the greatest country on the
planet. And they come there and find a place of solace to learn
and to remember the history of that day and to make sure that
we will absolutely never forget.
And Mr. Quinn, happy anniversary. I hope you get home safe.
Please know, for my days in Congress, as long as they will be,
and I hope they are long, I will continue to fight for every
resource for this museum, and I will make sure that my
colleagues and the rest of this country never forget 9/11.
Mr. Quinn. Thank you.
Mr. D'Esposito. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Mr. D'Esposito, for bringing this
bill forward to the Subcommittee.
Now, I would like to recognize the gentlelady from, not
right? How about if I go into questions, then?
Mr. French, thank you for being back before the Committee
here. The GAO, the Government Accountability Office, expressed
concern about statutory deadlines not being met. And you share
their conclusion that the Forest Service needs to reform its
application processing system.
Mr. French. I do, and we are. We put an interim portal, and
we have seen our response times go from meeting that deadline
about 55 percent of the time to about 75 percent of the time.
Mr. Tiffany. How would the legislation before us, and will
it, take us from an interim to a more permanent one-stop-shop
portal?
Mr. French. It is very helpful and supportive. We currently
have a grant right now where we are working on that system.
Having the authority behind it and for us to do this will be
very helpful.
Mr. Tiffany. I think there was some concern expressed in
regards to staffing also. With this portal will there be
sufficient staffing to be able to expeditiously move these?
Mr. French. Well, I think there are a couple of things to
think about here.
One is whenever you put together IT, you have to maintain
it over time. So, we have to have the funding and staffing to
make sure that in 5 years we don't have the resources to keep
it updated, which is actually a chronic issue with IT systems
within the Federal Government. We usually have the money to
build it, we don't necessarily always have the resources to
continue it.
We have 66,000 special use permits across the agency. This
year we have received about 4,400 new applications. We have
processed and completed 3,400 of those with a staff of
essentially 16 to 100. That is the biggest chronic issue we
have, is staffing. The portal helps us by us being able to see
in a one-time place where the applications are occurring, and
to move capacity to help do that and keep the local units on
track for being accountable for those time frames. Otherwise,
we can't see it.
Mr. Tiffany. I don't know if you have studied this, is this
an instance where perhaps artificial intelligence might be able
to help to be able to process them?
Mr. French. Yes, we are seeing artificial intelligence help
us on many fronts right now, from being able to review comments
that come in, looking at common environmental issues, providing
information back, environmental compliance, but also looking at
where you are seeing surges for applications and helping us
think more proactively about how we deploy personnel and
resources.
Mr. Tiffany. Switching to the corridors, the Fire Safe
Corridors, a lot of devastating wildfires have been started as
a result of these power lines sparking. And why is it important
that utility companies have greater flexibility?
And actually, I think you have worked extensively on this
issue, haven't you?
Mr. French. I have.
Mr. Tiffany. Why is that important that they have greater
flexibility?
Mr. French. We have 18,000 miles of power lines that cross
the National Forest System, from large, big power lines to very
small power lines that are running through communities. The
proper maintenance of those is critical to protect our
communities from forest fires, bottom line. Small, rural
electric cooperatives are challenged to find the funding to do
this sort of maintenance work. And our processes at times take
too long in order to keep up with that.
There are four things that I think are critical for
managing our power lines right now: funding, the proper
staffing, getting things done in a timely manner, and there are
growing issues with companies being able to manage the strict
liability associated with our permits. They have trouble
finding insurance and things like that.
This bill helps on the efficiency side of things. We don't
feel it necessary to be required. Trees are considered property
of the Federal Government, so we have to value those and sell
those under very strict timber sales. For the protection and
safety along with power lines, removing that stipulation would
be very helpful in terms of efficiency and time to approve
these.
Mr. Tiffany. So, will this combination, of course, we had
the Fix our Forests Act that I referenced earlier, and now this
Fire Safe Corridors. Will that combination help to be able to
alleviate that challenge that is before you?
Mr. French. Yes, it will.
Mr. Tiffany. Mr. Caldwell, how is the Park Service going to
ensure that private property rights and local decision-making
will be protected with the National Historic Park here in
Washington, DC?
Mr. Caldwell. Concerning the Civil War Defenses Park? I
think what the Department believes with the proposed bill is
that we are preserving those 16 different units, 16 different
sites affiliated with the Civil War Defenses on site within
three of our units, within one region of the National Park
Service. We believe that is certainly sufficient to preserve
those sites while respecting private property rights.
Mr. Tiffany. You expressed a concern, I believe, in your
testimony in regards to the stadium in Daytona Beach. Have you
communicated them with Mr. Jaworski or anyone that is with the
ballpark?
Mr. Caldwell. First, I think that certainly the Department
recognizes the incredible history that Jackie Robinson
represents.
It is our belief that we should conduct a special resource
study prior to any designation of the stadium. We believe that
would allow us to take a look at the resource, take a look at
the significance, see if it is feasible for inclusion in the
National Park System, or what other arrangements could be
arranged in partnership with maybe state and local governments
or the private sector.
And most importantly, we feel strongly that a special
resource study process gives us an opportunity to have a public
input with stakeholders and the local communities as we
complete the special resource study and provide Congress our
recommendations.
Mr. Tiffany. Has this been communicated to you, Mr.
Jaworski, other than today?
Mr. Jaworski. Not at this time, no.
Mr. Tiffany. OK, so this is the first that you know about
this.
Mr. Jaworski. Correct.
Mr. Caldwell. And Mr. Caldwell, will you be providing
information to Mr. Jaworski or his cohorts to make sure that
they can get to the right people and understand what your
concerns are?
Mr. Caldwell. Yes, we will, sir. Thank you.
Mr. Tiffany. OK, I am going to close with Mr. Romano.
We have the Federal concerns that are before us. I would
like to shift a little bit away from the bills here. Do you
also run into some local concerns? In particular, I think about
zoning and things like that. What are the principal concerns
that you are finding locally or at the state level?
Mr. Romano. The first one I will mention, and it is
something you brought up in your opening remarks with respect
to previously disturbed land, we find repeatedly that the
processes of trying to upgrade facilities in previously
disturbed earth seem to take longer than one might think at
first blush. Especially in our case, for example, we are
replacing copper. Our members, the telephone companies way back
in the day who started up when that was the unserved issue,
they are now trying to replace that, and have replaced it in
many cases, with fiber. But it is a bit startling to see how
long that process takes to get clearances for historic
preservation and environmental review associated with something
as seemingly simple as upgrading facilities within an existing
right-of-way to move them from copper to fiber, for example.
So, that is one thing I think we see at Federal, state, and
local levels alike.
The second thing--
Mr. Tiffany. Can I just follow up on that first one?
Mr. Romano. Yes, please.
Mr. Tiffany. So, you are just saying to basically use a
different type of material, but you are going to be in
basically the same footprint, and yet you are running into
extensive reviews that sometimes happen. Is that accurate?
Mr. Romano. That is correct, yes. So, it may be a culvert
along a roadway, where we are taking out the fiber or taking
out copper and putting fiber and conduit. Yes, sir.
Mr. Tiffany. OK, thank you.
Mr. Romano. A second issue I would mention, again, and just
to put another highlight on this, is the staffing question,
because that is something we see especially at state and local
levels, where there is insufficient staffing in order to
process the number of applications they see. So, as a result,
even the most efficient system becomes a bit of a bottleneck
because there are one, two, or three people in a given office.
I will say this has gotten better since COVID, when it was
really probably most problematic, but it continues to be a
challenge. And we are particularly concerned about this in the
context of there are billions of dollars of Federal funding and
state funding flowing right now into broadband deployment,
which is fantastic, we are going to hopefully overcome the
digital divide, but there remains a concern that will there be
the parties to handle this? We hear a lot about the fact that
it takes years for deployment. This is often the long pole in
the tent.
The last thing I will mention just briefly, and this is a
little bit of an aside from state and local, but railroad
crossings. Railroad crossings, especially in rural areas,
continue to be a rather significant impediment. There are not a
lot of ways to get around a railroad track. You have to go far
down one way or the other to get around that. And the amount of
time, the amount of expense that it takes to get across a
railroad crossing, underneath a railroad crossing is
surprisingly large, given the several hours of work and having
a few people out there to flag. You want to be concerned about
safety.
But at times it appears to be, again, another long pole in
the tent, and a very expensive one when it comes to placement
of facilities in rural areas.
Mr. Tiffany. Where does that problem lie?
Mr. Romano. In terms of jurisdictionally, who has
jurisdiction over that? That is a great question, Mr. Chairman.
States have passed laws with respect to this to try to deal
with this. There is some thought that maybe the FCC has some
authority, pursuant to its ability to pre-empt state laws and
local laws that might create barriers in terms of the amount of
hoops that one has to jump through to get through railroad
crossings. It is certainly something we would encourage
Congress to take a look at, and other stakeholders have joined
us in the communications industry to----
Mr. Tiffany. Do you think it is a Federal problem?
Mr. Romano. It is a nationwide problem, for sure. Right
now, though, a lot of railroad crossings are governed by state
laws. The question is, I think at least the very least, we
would encourage Congress to take a look at it to see whether
the state laws are working, whether there is a place for a
Federal regime that might be more streamlined. And in
particular, whether certain communities have become harder to
reach as a result of some of these issues.
So, I would say that it is probably a Federal-State
partnership, but I do think there is a role for Congress to
play and potentially agencies to play in at least looking at
the problem and scoping and sizing it to determine where the
solution may lie best.
Mr. Tiffany. Thank you.
Finally, Mr. Jaworski, this is an active ballpark that we
are talking about here. This is just not a museum set piece or
anything like this, and you anticipate that this will continue
to be an active site here as we go forward. Is that accurate?
Mr. Jaworski. Yes, that is correct.
Mr. Tiffany. Is there anything that you were not able to
cover in your testimony that you would like to share with the
Committee?
Mr. Jaworski. I think I covered just about most of it. I
mean, to your point about being an active site, we are
currently affiliates of the Cincinnati Reds. As I mentioned
briefly, we are working on $30 million of renovations to the
ballpark.
Briefly, back in 2019, when Major League Baseball was going
through their restructure, we were at risk of losing the
affiliation, and losing our Major League Baseball partnership.
And that is when a lot of the renovations and the construction
that is ongoing is going to take place to allow us to be able
to continue to play baseball at Jackie Robinson Ballpark, and
that is something that, obviously, we are extremely proud of to
carry on, and continue that message, to continue to share that
story for generations to come. And to say that it is pretty
special is definitely an understatement, for sure.
Thank you for your time here today.
Mr. Tiffany. Yes, I appreciate your testimony.
Members, if you have another question, I will allow it. And
Ms. Hoyle, if you have anything that you wanted to follow up
on, you are welcome to.
If not, Mr. D'Esposito?
Mr. D'Esposito. I am good, Mr. Chairman, thank you.
Mr. Tiffany. Well, I would like to thank all the witnesses
for their testimony and Members for your questions.
The members of the Subcommittee may have some additional
questions for our witnesses today, and we will ask that they
respond to those in writing. Under Committee Rule 3, members of
the Subcommittee must submit questions to the Subcommittee
Clerk by 5 p.m. on Friday, July 12, 2024. The hearing record
will be held open for 10 business days for those responses.
If there is no further business, without objection, the
Subcommittee on Federal Lands stands adjourned.

[Whereupon, at 11:32 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

[ADDITIONAL MATERIALS SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD]

Statement for the Record
Bureau of Land Management
U.S. Department of the Interior
H.R. 3299, DIGITAL Applications Act
H.R. 3283, Facilitating DIGITAL Applications Act

Thank you for the opportunity to provide this Statement for the
Record on H.R. 3299, the Deploying Infrastructure with Greater Internet
Transactions And Legacy Applications Act (``DIGITAL Applications Act'')
and H.R. 3283, the Facilitating the Deployment of Infrastructure with
Greater Internet Transactions and Legacy Applications Act
(``Facilitating DIGITAL Applications Act''). H.R. 3299 requires the
establishment of online portals for applications for rights-of-way for
communications use, and H.R. 3283 contains reporting requirements for
the Department of Commerce regarding the establishment of such portals.
The BLM supports the goals of H.R. 3299. However, we believe that the
timeframe specified for establishment of the required online portals is
not achievable given current resources.
The BLM defers to the Department of Commerce regarding potential
impacts associated with H.R. 3283.
Background

The BLM manages approximately 245 million surface acres, located
primarily in 12 western states, and approximately 700 million acres of
subsurface mineral estate. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act
(FLPMA) sets forth the BLM's multiple-use mission, directing that
public lands generally be managed for a broad range of uses, such as
renewable and conventional energy development, livestock grazing,
timber production, hunting and fishing, recreation, wilderness, and
conservation--including protecting cultural and historic resources.
FLPMA also requires the BLM to manage public land resources on a
sustained-yield basis for the benefit of current and future
generations.
Under Title V of FLPMA, the BLM is authorized to grant, issue, or
renew rights-of-way (ROW) over, upon, under, or through public lands
for specific projects, such as roads, pipelines, transmission lines,
and communication sites. A ROW grant authorizes rights and privileges
for a specific use of the land for a specific period of time.
Generally, a BLM ROW is granted for a term appropriate for the life of
the project.
The BLM currently administers more than 1,500 communications sites
on public lands in the 11 Western states and Alaska. Most
communications sites on BLM-managed public lands are located at
geographic elevations and consist of one or more facilities (such as
towers, antennas, or other buildings) owned by private or governmental
entities. Activities at each site are managed by a local BLM field
office under a resource management plan and a site-specific management
plan. To date, the BLM has authorized the construction and operation of
more than 4,000 facilities--ranging from radio and television
transmitters to cellular and wireless broadband towers--using ROW
grants.
H.R. 3299 & H.R. 3283

H.R. 3299 requires the Department of the Interior (Department) and
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish online portals to
accept, process, and dispose of Standard Form 299 (SF-299) applications
for communications use within one year of enactment. The bill further
requires the Department of Commerce to publish links to these portals
on the website of the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA). H.R. 3283 requires the Department of Commerce to
provide a report to Congress within 90 days of enactment and every 60
days thereafter until such online portals are established. The bill
requires the reports to describe any barriers to the establishment of
the online portals. In addition, H.R. 3283 would require the Department
and USDA to provide notice to NTIA within three days of establishing
their respective portals.
The BLM places a high priority on working with applicants on their
proposed ROW to process the application expeditiously while ensuring
the protection of resource values. The BLM strives to provide ROW
applicants a decision within 60 days from the receipt of a completed
application. The BLM also notifies applicants after 30 days if the
application processing will take longer and provides a date when a
decision on the application can be reasonably expected.
The BLM notes that it has already established an online portal for
the submission of SF-299 applications for communications use. The BLM's
Mineral and Land Records System (MLRS) is an online platform for
delivering and reporting mineral and land records transactions,
tracking, and mapping. In June 2023, the BLM added the ability to
submit SF-299 applications for communications use electronically via
MLRS. The BLM does not currently have an online portal dedicated to the
processing or approval/rejection of these applications; these tasks are
handled by staff at the applicable BLM office, who work with applicants
directly.
While the BLM supports the goals of H.R. 3299 to establish an
online portal to process and dispose of SF-299 applications for
communications use, the agency would be unable to do so within the one-
year timeframe specified in the bill given current resources. The BLM
notes that the development and refinement of MLRS, which includes the
modernization of a number of legacy systems, has been a resource-
intensive, multi-year effort. As such, we would like to work with the
Sponsor and the Subcommittee on a more reasonable timeframe to develop,
or incorporate into existing platforms, a fully functioning platform
that can authenticate and process SF-299 applications for
communications use. We would also like to work with the Sponsor to
clarify their intent with respect to the terms ``acceptance'' and
``disposal'' in the bill.
The BLM defers to the USDA regarding any impacts associated with
H.R. 3299 on the USDA Forest Service. Regarding H.R. 3283, we defer to
the Department of Commerce on the provisions affecting their interests.
Conclusion

Thank you again for the opportunity to provide this Statement for
the Record.

Thank you, Chairman Tiffany.
Good morning, everyone. It's good to be back after the July 4th
holiday last week.
The bills on today's agenda once again serve as a reminder of the
wide range of benefits and uses associated with our parks and public
lands--and the work that we can get done under this subcommittee.
It is imperative that we continue to identify new places worthy of
recognition, while bolstering our protection of those that have already
been identified.
As members of the Federal Lands Subcommittee, we collectively have
the opportunity to champion new conservation opportunities--something I
was proud to lead when I served as Chair of this Subcommittee, and
continue to advocate for today.
Some of the bills on our agenda today serve as a way for us to
recognize the historical and diverse stories across our nation, and I'm
looking forward to hearing more about these bills.
This hearing continues a promising trend of considering more
conservation and commemorative bills. As we have heard in our last two
subcommittee hearings, there are still plenty of places throughout the
country that deserve increased protection and conservation.
But I would also like to remind my friends across the aisle that
there is a long running list of additional bills-sponsored by members
of both parties--to create new national parks, designate new wilderness
and withdrawals, and protect some of the most special places across our
great nation.
This includes my CORE Act, which I've talked about many times in
this Subcommittee, and so many more.
Our constituents support real conservation, enhanced recreational
opportunities, and even ways to accelerate tribal co-stewardship and
enhance protections for sacred sites.
Two of the bills that we are considering today have already
received legislative hearings, been marked up, and advanced unanimously
through the Energy and Commerce Committee.
H.R. 3283 and H.R. 3299 both seek to promote accessibility and
transparency in the permitting process for locating or modifying
various types of communications or broadband equipment and
infrastructure on public lands.
There is significant support from both sides of the aisle for these
bills and increasing the deployment of broadband across public lands.
There are many other pieces of legislation that are still waiting
for a hearing and consideration by our Subcommittee.
For example, one of the bills we are considering today is the
Jackie Robinson Commemorative Site Act.
I know the Park Service has expressed concerns with commemorative
site designations because they do not include any direct federal
management or other nexus, and while this bill only scratches the
surface of the long list of bills we need to consider by the end of the
year, I still think it represents a good start.
This bill would continue to bolster the Robinson legacy in the
world of professional baseball and beyond, and I appreciate the
entirety of the Florida delegation for bringing the history of the
stadium in Daytona to the Federal Lands Subcommittee so we can learn
more about the best way to achieve this goal.
Also on the agenda is H.R. 5401 to authorize a one-time grant from
the Department of Homeland Security to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum in
New York City to assist with operations, security, and maintenance of
the facilities.
The 9/11 Memorial and Museum is the principal tribute of
remembrance and honor of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the terror
attacks at the World Trade Center in 2001 and the six killed in the
World Trade Center bombing in February of 1993.
I look forward to hearing more about this initiative and would like
to encourage cooperation among all interested parties in the continued
operation of the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. To that end, I ask unanimous
consent to enter into the record a letter from a coalition of
interfaith organizations with constructive recommendations for this
bill moving forward.
Next, we have Representative Carbajal's Fire Safe Electric
Corridors Act, which would allow for the removal of hazardous trees
near power lines without requiring a timber sale.
As Co-Chair of the Wildfire Caucus, I am pleased to see this bill
on our agenda as there is much to be done to improve our wildfire
preparedness and mitigation, and I am excited to work with
Representative Carbajal on this initiative.
And last, but certainly not least, H.R. 7976 from my colleague and
friend Representative Holmes Norton would designate the Civil War
Defenses of Washington National Historical Park.
Washington, DC. served as the Union's capital during the American
Civil War and dozens of sites in the area are currently managed by the
National Park Service--but not given the full recognition that a
unified National Historical Park would bring.
I look forward to hearing from the Congresswoman about the history
and significance of these sites.
I'd like to close by repeating my message from earlier in my
opening statement. We need to be listening to our constituents and
hearing bills that are important to them, and I hope the Chairman will
work with me to ensure we are also taking up bills to protect and
conserve our nation's public lands.
We still have a lot of work to do, and only six months left to do
it--but I look forward to working to get this done.
With that Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

Statement for the Record
9/11 Advocacy Coalition
H.R. 5401, 9/11 Memorial & Museum Act

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and Members of the
Committee,
We, a broad coalition of faith and secular leaders, advocates,
historians, educators, and directly impacted 9/11 family members, write
to express our concerns regarding H.R. 5401, which proposes increased
funding for the National 9/11 Museum. While the Museum operates as a
non-profit, it continues to disregard public input and fuels anti-
Islamic rhetoric. There are significant opportunities for improvement
in its governance, transparency, and inclusivity.
The Museum has faced challenges in managing funds and has taken
public funds while operating in a manner that does not always align
with the guidelines of public institutions and the norm of
transparency. The Board has resisted incorporating the powerful legacy
of inter-religious response, recovery efforts, and reconciliation work.
Additionally, the Museum has maintained certain exhibits, such as the
20+ year old video ``The Rise of Al Qaeda,'' which could benefit from
updates to reflect a more balanced perspective. Furthermore, the
Museum's leadership has continued to support Board member Debra
Burlingame, despite her history of controversial statements, including
publicly sharing anti-Muslim sentiments by calling Muslims ``weird
animals'' and connecting the practice of Islam to extremism and
violence.

Our coalition is committed to working collaboratively to ensure
that the Museum can fulfill its mission in a way that is inclusive and
respectful of all communities. To this end, we propose the following
recommendations for the Subcommittee's consideration:

1.  Reinstate a Multifaith Advisory Committee: The Museum should
reinstate a multifaith advisory committee to review exhibit
content and meet with the board and leadership quarterly.

2.  Ensure Transparent Governance: The Museum should commit to
transparent governance, adhering to budget targets and
development strategies aligned with philanthropic
standards.

3.  Implement an Academic Review Process: The Museum should create an
academic advisory council to ensure scholarly rigor and
prevent the conflation of Islam with Al-Qaeda in its
exhibits.

4.  Highlight Diverse Contributions: The Museum should explicitly
address the diverse contributions of Americans of all
faiths and backgrounds in the aftermath of September 11,
2001.

5.  Enhance Public Engagement: The Museum should institutionalize
public-facing processes and community engagement, creating
multiple platforms for community participation, including
directly impacted families.

In addition, we suggest considering the Memorial's operation under
the National Park Service, with the museum and its archive managed by
the Smithsonian.
We strongly oppose Congress passing H.R. 5401 to provide more
funding for the Museum due to its refusal to engage in constructive
dialog with groups such as this diverse coalition that includes those
who lost loved ones during 9/11, historians, clergy, and civil society
leaders. Addressing the public's concerns regarding the content shared
with the thousands of visitors each day is crucial.
We believe these steps will help the Museum operate in a manner
that is inclusive, transparent, and reflective of the diverse fabric of
our nation. We urge the Subcommittee to withhold additional funding
until these recommendations are addressed.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter. We look
forward to working together to support the Museum in becoming a beacon
of inclusivity and understanding.

Husein Yatabarry
Muslim Community Network
H.R. 5401, 9/11 Memorial & Museum Act

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and Members of the
Committee,

Thank you for allowing me to submit written testimony regarding
H.R. 5401, the 9/11 Memorial & Museum Act. My name is Husein Yatabarry,
and I am the Executive Director of the Muslim Community Network.
As a Black Muslim of West African descent, my roots in New York run
deep. My father immigrated to the US in 1987 and my mother followed in
1991. On September 11, 2001, I was just 9 years old. That day remains
vividly etched in my memory. I was in my 4th grade classroom at PS53 in
The Bronx, confused as teachers urgently gathered in the hallway. My
mother's sudden appearance, her face lined with worry, only added to my
confusion. ``The twin towers have been struck by planes,'' she told me.
Those towers held a personal connection for us; we had photos from
family visits, and my father had worked at a restaurant there in the
late 90s. As we watched the tragedy unfold on television, the gravity
of the situation and the identities of the perpetrators became starkly
clear.
In the immediate aftermath, the nation's focus was not on
understanding the intricate dynamics of global politics and the rise of
extremist groups. Instead, a wave of fear and suspicion engulfed
communities, particularly targeting Muslims and Islam. The Muslim
community in the US faced swift and severe backlash, marked by public
hostility and undue scrutiny from government entities. My world, once
familiar and secure, was suddenly filled with anxiety and uncertainty
about our place in this country. The US, my birthplace and home, felt
increasingly alien and hostile. The media and institutions often
silenced our diverse perspectives, favoring oversimplified narratives
of ``us versus them.'' This oversimplification denied the American
public the opportunity to engage with and understand the rich, complex
narratives of Muslims and Islam.
While I understand the noble intent behind H.R. 5401, which seeks
to ensure federal support for the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, I must
express deep concerns that need to be addressed before additional
funding is granted.
The 9/11 Memorial and Museum, despite its status as a non-profit
institution, has repeatedly ignored public input and allowed anti-
Muslim rhetoric to persist within its exhibits. This is deeply
troubling and must be rectified. There have been significant issues
with the Museum's financial transparency and adherence to the high
standards expected of public institutions.

For years, the Board has resisted incorporating the rich and
powerful legacy of inter-religious solidarity, recovery efforts, and
reconciliation work that followed the 9/11 attacks. To address these
serious concerns, I propose the following actions:

First, the Museum must reinstate a multifaith advisory committee.
This committee should review exhibit content to ensure that diverse
perspectives are represented and meet with the board and leadership
quarterly to provide ongoing input and guidance.

Second, the Museum must commit to transparent governance. This
means adhering to budget targets and aligning development strategies
with philanthropic standards. Transparent governance is critical to
building trust and ensuring responsible management of public funds.

Third, an academic review process must be implemented. Forming an
academic advisory council will ensure scholarly rigor and prevent the
conflation of Islam with Al-Qaeda in exhibits. This council can offer
expert oversight to ensure that content is accurate and balanced.

Fourth, the Museum should explicitly recognize the diverse
contributions of Americans of all faiths and backgrounds in the
aftermath of September 11, 2001. Highlighting these contributions will
foster a more inclusive narrative that reflects the unity and
resilience that emerged in the wake of the attacks.

Fifth, enhancing public engagement is essential. The Museum should
create multiple platforms for community participation, including
directly impacted families. Institutionalizing public-facing processes
and community engagement will ensure that the voices of all
stakeholders are heard and valued.
Additionally, we recommend that the operation of the Memorial be
considered for transfer to the National Park Service, with the museum
and its archive managed by the Smithsonian Institution. This would
leverage the expertise and resources of these respected organizations
to benefit the Memorial and Museum.
I strongly oppose the passage of H.R. 5401 to provide more funding
for the Museum until these critical recommendations are implemented.
The Museum must engage in constructive dialog with a diverse range of
groups, including those who lost loved ones during 9/11, historians,
clergy, and civil society leaders. Addressing public concerns regarding
the content shared with visitors daily is vital.
Implementing these steps will help the Museum operate inclusively,
transparently, and reflect the diverse fabric of our nation. I urge the
Subcommittee to withhold additional funding until these necessary
changes are made.

H.R. 7976, Civil War Defenses of Washington National Historical Park
Act

I thank Chairman Tiffany and Ranking Member Neguse for holding this
hearing and allowing me to testify on H.R. 7976, the Civil War Defenses
of Washington National Historical Park Act.
The Civil War Defenses of Washington, including forts, unarmed
batteries and rifle trenches, created a ring of protection for the
nation's capital during the Civil War. This bill would recognize and
preserve the Defenses of Washington located in the District of
Columbia, Virginia and Maryland by redesignating the 22 Defenses of
Washington currently under National Park Service jurisdiction as a
national historical park, and allowing other sites associated with the
Defenses of Washington that are owned by D.C. or a unit of state
governments to be affiliated with the national historical park through
cooperative agreements. This bill would also require the Secretary of
the Interior to facilitate the history of the Civil War, including the
history of the Defenses of Washington and the Shenandoah Valley
Campaign of 1864, being assembled, arrayed and conveyed for the benefit
of the public.
The Defenses of Washington were constructed at the beginning of the
war, in 1861, as a ring of protection for the nation's capital and for
President Abraham Lincoln. By the end of the war, these defenses
included 68 forts, 93 unarmed batteries, 807 mounted cannons, 13 miles
of rifle trenches and 32 miles of military roads. The major test of the
Defenses of Washington came with the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of
1864, when Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal Early, directed by
General Robert E. Lee, sought to attack the nation's capital from the
north, causing Union forces threatening to attack Richmond, the capital
of the Confederacy, to be withdrawn. General Early was delayed by Union
Major General Lew Wallace at the Battle of Monocacy on July 9, 1864,
and was stopped at the northern edge of Washington at the Battle of
Fort Stevens on July 11-12, 1864. The Shenandoah Valley Campaign ended
when Union Lieutenant General Philip Sheridan defeated General Early at
the Battle of Cedar Creek, Virginia on October 19, 1864.
Nearly all the individual forts in the Defenses of Washington--on
both sides of the Potomac and Anacostia rivers--were involved in
stopping General Early's attack, and the Battle of Fort Stevens was the
second and last attempt by the Confederate Army to attack Washington.
Taken together, these battles were pivotal to the outcome of the
war and the freedom and democracy that the war represented for this
country. It is therefore fitting that we recognize the Defenses of
Washington by redesignating them as a national historical park.
Again, thank you for holding this hearing and allowing me to
testify. I look forward to working with you to pass this bill.

Statement for the Record
Steve Powell
President and Chief Executive Officer
Southern California Edison

Chair Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the
Subcommittee, my name is Steve Powell, the President, and CEO of
Southern California Edison, and I am here today to express support for
H.R. 6012, the Fire Safe Electrical Corridors Act, legislation
sponsored by Representatives Salud Carbajal and Lori Chavez-DeRemer.
I want to first share my appreciation to this Committee for its
strong commitment to addressing the threat of catastrophic wildfires
facing the West and, increasingly, throughout other parts of the United
States. As we have all seen, wildfires are growing in frequency and
burning with greater intensity.
Furthermore, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the importance
of the Fire Safe Electrical Corridors Act, and the role this
legislation will play in reducing wildfire threat in our National
Forests. Passage of this Bill will encourage preservation of forest
lands and enhance wildfire protection. Currently, vegetation mitigation
practices on Forest lands do not provide flexibility to remove felled
timber and vegetation debris. This is a deficiency that would be
addressed by H.R. 6012.
Southern California Edison is an electric utility that delivers
power to 15 million people across Southern, Central and Coastal
California. SCE has facilities within eight National Forests, seven of
which are managed by the Pacific Southwest Region (Region 5) of the
U.S. Forest Service. They include Angeles, Cleveland, Inyo, Los Padres,
San Bernardino, Sequoia, and Sierra National Forests. This legislation
would also have an impact on SCE's work in Humboldt-Toiyabe, which is
located in Region 6.
Wildfire mitigation has been an integral part of SCE's operational
practices for many years, and we are continuing to strengthen our
programs to manage and reduce the risk we face. We have stepped up our
comprehensive mitigation efforts and have made substantial progress
through our Wildfire Mitigation Plans. Our efforts include hardening
the grid, increasing our situational awareness, and improving our
operational practices, including vegetation management.
On an annual basis, SCE's vegetation management program inspects
roughly 1.6 million trees in our service area, including 745,000 trees
located in High Fire Risk Areas. Roughly half of these trees require
pruning. In addition, in High Fire Risk Areas, we inspect trees that
could pose a hazard by falling or blowing into our electrical assets.
Since 2018, our certified arborists have assessed over 400,000 unique
trees that potentially pose a hazard, with roughly 5% requiring removal
as the form of mitigation. In 2024, we plan to assess approximately
240,000 potentially hazardous trees and mitigate about 7,500 of them.
For Forest Service lands in particular, SCE has historically
mitigated approximately 19,000 trees annually. Going forward, SCE
anticipates mitigating approximately 10,000-15,000 trees annually.
However, mitigation volumes may increase, especially following natural
disasters such as wildfires, windstorms, or beetle infestations.
For the past several years, the electric utility industry has been
working with the federal land management agencies, principally the
Forest Service and BLM, to address wildfire risk on federal lands. In
2022, Forest Service Chief Randy Moore formed a government-industry
working group to address issues like streamlining the permitting
process to allow utilities to perform wildfire mitigation activities
more quickly and efficiently. Despite much progress, the working group
continues to face regulatory challenges which limit the effectiveness
of utility wildfire mitigation efforts on federal lands. One of these
challenges is how timber felled through wildfire mitigation activities
can be efficiently removed from the National Forests.
Electric utilities currently receive special use permits, which
provide authorization from the Forest Service to fell dead, diseased,
dying, and green hazard trees located in their respective service
territory through permitted vegetation management operations. In order
to remove the felled trees, current regulations require utilities to
purchase the felled trees from the Forest Service through a timber sale
contract or give the trees away to certain designated entities through
a time consuming and inefficient process. 36 CFR 223--the Sale and
Disposal of National Forest System Timber--proscribes specific
authorities by which the Forest Service can allow an entity to remove
felled trees including: a timber sale; giving them to a Native American
tribe; or reducing them to firewood at a campsite.
Utilities have suggested other options including the use of
categorical exclusions or stewardship agreements, but the Forest
Service has indicated that these options do not give them the legal
authority needed to allow timber to be removed by utilities. They are
effectively restricted by regulations based on current law.
The options provided under current law are not always practical or
efficient for utilities. The result, in many cases, is that the
utilities are forced to leave the felled trees onsite in the National
Forests. This worsens an already vulnerable situation from a wildfire
perspective, as debris and felled timber from previous years'
vegetation mitigation operations remain in the forest landscape. In
essence, the accumulation of this debris increases the intensity of
wildfires. Removal of this fuel benefits the forest by helping to
create fuel breaks and reduce wildfire intensity should a wildfire
occur.
Representatives Carbajal and Chavez-DeRemer have recognized the
problems with existing law and are working to provide a solution. The
legislation we are discussing today, the Fire Safe Electrical Corridors
Act, would grant the USDA the authority to allow electric utilities
with proper permits to remove timber that is felled within the vicinity
of its power lines. This commonsense, bipartisan, legislation will
reduce the amount of fuel in our National Forests and help us manage
the wildfire risk on federal lands.
Thank you for the opportunity to share Southern California Edison's
support of H.R. 6012, the Fire Safe Electrical Corridors Act.
