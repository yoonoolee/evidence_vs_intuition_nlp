I. KEY MESSAGES

The Biden administration's proposed budget for the Bureau
of Land Management (BLM) and the National Park Service
(NPS) is out of touch with the issues everyday Americans
are facing, like high energy costs, inflation, and lack of
access to public lands. The budget harms rural communities,
families, and small businesses.

The BLM budget is a fundamental threat to the Western way
of life, focusing on topics like climate change,
environmental justice, and clean energy at the expense of
rural Americans whose jobs depend on the multiple uses of
our public lands.

The NPS budget inexplicably cuts programs that improve
access to our nation's crown jewels and reduce the deferred
maintenance backlog to fund vague and undefined
administration priorities.

In contrast, Committee Republicans have advanced
commonsense, bipartisan solutions that allow access to our
abundant federal lands to support American energy
dominance, national security, and rural economies.

Bureau of Land Management

Overview--The BLM manages 245 million acres of public lands,
heavily concentrated (99 percent) in the 11 western continental states
and Alaska, and 714 million acres of federal subsurface mineral
estate.\1\ The BLM manages approximately 1 out of every 10 surface
acres and 1 out of 3 subsurface acres in the U.S.\2\ Under the agency's
enabling statute, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976
(FLPMA), BLM manages public lands based on a multiple-use and sustained
yield mandate (multiple-use mandate) that supports livestock grazing,
energy and mineral development, recreation, timber production,
watershed protection, and wildlife and fish habitat.\3\ In FY 2022,
activities undertaken on BLM-managed lands supported almost $263
billion in economic output and approximately 1 million jobs.\4\ BLM
lands attract over 82 million visitors annually.\5\ The President's FY
2025 budget includes $1.556 billion in discretionary appropriations for
the BLM, a 7.1 percent increase from the FY 2024 annualized Continuing
Resolution (CR). This includes an additional 104 full-time equivalents
(FTEs), or staff.

Onshore Oil and Gas Program--In FY 2023, Federal oil production
on Federal and Native American lands totaled 588 million barrels, and
natural gas production on Federal and Native American lands totaled
roughly 4 trillion cubic feet.\6\ While oil and natural gas production
increased on Federal lands from FY 2022, production dropped on Native
American lands.\7\ Federal and Native American leases generated
approximately $8.94 billion in bonus bids, royalties, rents, and other
revenues in FY 2023.\8\ Nearly half of the revenue from Federal leases
was distributed to states in accordance with statutory revenue-sharing
provisions.\9\

The Mineral Leasing Act explicitly states that ``lease sales shall
be held for each State where eligible lands are available at least
quarterly and more frequently if the Secretary of the Interior
determines such sales are necessary.'' \10\ In his first days in
office, President Biden imposed an indefinite pause on new oil and
natural gas leasing on U.S. federal lands and waters.\11\ On June 15,
2021, a U.S. District Court judge placed an injunction on the
Department of the Interior's (DOI's) unlawful moratorium and ordered
DOI to restart the leasing process.\12\ In response, the Biden
administration appealed the decision and continued to delay scheduling
lease sales.\13\

Despite these actions, the Biden administration has attempted to
take credit for the increase in production on Federal lands, even
though most, if not all, of production is occurring on leases issued by
previous administrations. The Biden administration did not hold an
onshore Federal lease sale until June 2022 and only held 19 lease sales
over its first three years.\14\ By contrast, the Trump administration
held 82 lease sales over its first three years.\15\

The BLM's FY 2025 budget request would continue the Biden
administration's war on domestic energy production and small businesses
by requesting a new onshore oil and gas inspection fee, repealing the
enhanced oil recovery credit and the marginal well credit, and
proposing to end expensing of intangible drilling costs and the use of
percentage depletion with respect to oil and gas development.\16\ The
President's budget does not explain how BLM will address the permitting
backlogs for oil and gas drilling permits, which stood at 5,492 pending
permits in the latest published report.\17\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally, the BLM has recently taken new regulatory actions to
further impede future oil and gas production on federal lands. Last
month, for example, the BLM issued a final rule to update its oil and
gas leasing regulations.\18\ The rule would formally implement
provisions from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which increased the
royalty rate for production on federal lands but would also make major,
non-statutory changes to the BLM's onshore leasing program.
Specifically, the rule proposes ending nationwide bonding and
increasing the minimum bond amounts for individual lease bonds and
statewide lease bonds from $10,000 to $150,000 and from $25,000 to
$500,000, respectively. These significant increases would tie up
capital that would otherwise be put back into production. This result
is unjustifiable, given that only 37 orphaned oil and gas wells are on
BLM-managed lands.\19\ The rule would also formalize the use of
``preference criteria'' to inform the BLM's selection of lands for
lease sales.\20\ The BLM's stated rationale for this change is to avoid
conflict in areas with cultural, wildlife, and recreation
resources.\21\ This nebulous methodology could be especially
problematic if BLM field offices avoid leasing in all areas with
endangered or threatened species, critical habitat, or a nearby
recreation area. Additionally, this new criterion would be legally
binding and could open the BLM up to increased litigation if the agency
leased in areas with these resources. Lastly, the rule proposes to
create new fees and increase existing fees while limiting the use of
lease suspensions and drilling permit extensions.\22\ H.R. 6009, which
was introduced by Representative Boebert to nullify the rule, passed
the House of Representatives by a vote of 216-200.\23\

Last month, the BLM also finalized its ``Waste Prevention,
Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation'' rule.\24\
This rule aims to regulate methane emissions for oil operations on BLM
lands by forcing companies to pay royalties on uncaptured methane. The
rule builds off of a similar regulation that was finalized during the
Obama administration and later vacated by the Federal District Court
for the District of Wyoming.\25\ Judge Scott Skavdahl, an Obama
appointee, stated in his decision that ``although the stated purpose of
the Rule is waste prevention, significant aspects of the Rule evidence
its primary purpose being driven by an effort to regulate air
emissions, particularly greenhouse gases.'' \26\ In addition to
exceeding its statutory authority by trying to regulate air emissions,
Judge Skavdahl also found that BLM failed to adequately consider the
rule's costs, benefits, and impacts on marginal wells.\27\

The new final rule would require operators to submit either a Waste
Minimization Plan (WMP), including certification of a valid, executed
contract to sell the associated gas, or a self-certification of 100
percent capture of associated gas with oil-well applications for permit
to drill (APDs).\28\ The final rule would also set time and volume
limits on royalty-free (RF) flaring. It would not allow operators to
request that flared oil-well gas be deemed RF based on case-by-case
economic assessments.\29\ The new requirements in the rule would
significantly impact small oil and gas producers and marginal wells.
Concerningly, the economic analysis that the rule relies on is
incomplete. At the end of last month, the states of North Dakota,
Wyoming, Montana, and Texas filed a claim against the final regulation,
alleging that BLM has once again exceeded its statutory authority and
that BLM's cost-benefit analysis fails to meaningfully account for the
rule's impact on operators.\30\

On September 8, 2023, BLM issued a proposed rule, ``Management and
Protection of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska'' (NPR-A),
further limiting oil and gas leasing in the NPR-A.\31\ The final rule,
issued earlier this month, was largely unchanged and would require BLM
to review and gather public input at least every ten years to determine
whether BLM should create, expand, or add resources to Special Areas
within the NPR-A.\32\ In the rule, the BLM essentially reinterprets the
Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976 (NPRPA) by treating
13.1 million acres of Special Areas in the NRP-A as de facto
wilderness.\33\ However, NPRPA clearly states that DOI must ``conduct
an expeditious program of competitive leasing of oil and gas in the
Reserve.'' \34\ The entire Alaska delegation, along with a majority of
stakeholders on the North Slope, opposes the rule. They openly
criticize the administration for ignoring their concerns and limiting
engagement.\35\ In response, Representative Stauber introduced the
``Alaska's Right to Produce Act of 2023,'' which passed the House of
Representatives by a vote of 214-199.\36\

Renewable Energy Program--While the Biden administration has taken
action to stifle conventional energy sources on BLM lands, it continues
to push renewable energy development forward. The FY 2025 budget
justifies this bias by citing the administration's unrealistic
commitments to achieve a carbon-pollution-free power sector by 2035 and
reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\37\ Through the Renewable Energy
Management Program, the BLM oversees the processing of rights-of-way
(ROW) applications and leases for wind and solar energy, geothermal
energy leasing and production, and transmission development. The budget
request includes $53.1 million for BLM's onshore renewable energy
program, which is $12.1 million above the 2024 CR level.\38\ The BLM's
increased request aims to help with the permitting process by hiring
more staff. Still, it fails to include any meaningful legislative
proposals to streamline permitting processes, like reforming the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which continues to hamstring
renewable energy development. House Republicans passed provisions in
H.R. 1, the ``Lower Energy Costs Act,'' sponsored by Rep. Scalise, that
would streamline the NEPA process for all forms of energy, including
renewables.\39\

The BLM furthered its bias for renewable energy through recent
rulemakings. In May, BLM finalized its ``Rights-of-Way, Leasing, and
Operations for Renewable Energy'' rule to update its procedures
governing renewable energy and right-of-way programs. Title V of the
Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) requires ROW
grant holders and leaseholders to pay the ``fair market value'' for
using public lands.\40\ The fair market value is paid to BLM in the
form of rental fees and megawatt capacity fees. The BLM's final
regulation would significantly reduce acreage rents and capacity fees
by 80 percent for renewable energy sources on BLM land through 2035.
BLM is citing the authority provided to the agency in the ``Energy Act
of 2020,'' which allows BLM to ``reduce acreage rental rates and
capacity fees'' to ``promote the greatest use of wind and solar energy
resources.'' \41\

In January, BLM published its Draft Programmatic Environmental
Impact Statement (PEIS) for Utility-Scale Solar Energy Development
(Western Solar Plan) in the Federal Register.\42\ The Western Solar
Plan amends the 2012 Western Solar Plan to include 11 western states
(there were only 6 in the 2012 Plan) and identifies 22 million acres of
land open for solar applications.\43\ The proposed alternative has
caused dissent among western Republicans, who believe it will limit the
multiple uses of federal lands. Environmental special interest groups,
on the other hand, argue that too much land is currently being made
available for leasing. Additionally, the solar industry and the State
of Nevada both disagree with the revisions, claiming that they are too
restrictive and do not make enough land available for solar
leasing.\44\

Hardrock Mining--While no recommendations for streamlining the
permitting process for new hardrock mines are included in the budget
request, DOI issued a report from the Interagency Working Group (IWG)
on Mining Reform in September 2023.\45\ Although the report aimed to
identify recommendations to alleviate permitting delays, some
suggestions--like imposing a royalty on production and shifting the
mining claims system to a leasing system--would be detrimental to the
hardrock mining industry.\46\ On February 12, 2024, BLM posted a notice
seeking comments on vague mine permitting metrics which were informed
by the IWG report.\47\ This notice was posted to BLM's website instead
of the Federal Register.

Despite the Biden administration's acknowledgment that the U.S.'s
``over-reliance on foreign sources and adversarial nations for critical
minerals and materials [pose] national and economic security threats,''
DOI continues to shutter domestic mineral development.\48\ In January
2022, the Biden administration canceled Twin Metals Minnesota's two-
decades-old mineral leases and simultaneously began the withdrawal
process of over 225,000 acres of mineral-rich land in the same area,
effectively barring new extraction of minerals such as copper, nickel,
cobalt, platinum, and iron ore.\49\ In response, the House of
Representatives passed H.R. 3195, the ``Superior National Forest
Restoration Act,'' by a vote of 212-203 to reverse these
counterproductive measures.\50\

More recently, on April 19, 2024, BLM recommended the ``no action''
alternative in the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) for the Ambler Mining District Industrial Access Road (Ambler
Road) in Alaska.\51\ BLM's decision to refuse a ROW permit on the small
section of the proposed 211-mile Ambler Road that crosses federal lands
not only impedes access to an estimated $7.5 billion in copper and
other minerals such as zinc, cobalt, silver, and gold, it also hinders
development that could bring Alaska over 65,000 jobs, $5 billion in
wages, and $1.3 billion in state and local revenues.\52\ During a May
1, 2024, hearing before the full Committee, Secretary Haaland testified
that DOI has ``. . . approved 40 mining or mining modification permits
since the President has been in office, that includes five critical
mineral mines.'' \53\ However, she was unable to answer questions about
which minerals these mines would extract, and DOI has yet to provide
the Committee with requested, specific data on these actions.

applies specifically to the oil and gas leasing program, the
administration continued its ban on coal leasing. On August 15, 2022, a
federal judge fully reinstated the coal moratorium on new leasing.\54\

30x30 Initiative and Locking Up Lands--The Biden administration
continues to conduct orchestrated attacks on public lands, using a
variety of tools to further the 30x30 agenda. These preservationist
policies limit access, hurt local economies, and remove uses of public
lands that benefit Americans. The Biden budget continues to support the
30x30 Initiative, including through several references in the BLM
budget.\57\ On May 6, 2021, DOI and other federal departments released
an ``interim'' report titled ``Conserving and Restoring America the
Beautiful,'' which outlined a 10-year campaign to preserve 30 percent
of U.S. lands and waters by 2030.\58\ The administration proposed an
American Conservation and Stewardship Atlas in this report. Nearly
three years later, the administration finally published this Atlas,
even though DOI has already been implementing 30x30 without clear goals
or definitions and in whatever manner it considers to be convenient on
any given day.\59\ These measures continually threaten working lands,
private landowners, and multiple uses of land.

BLM Public Lands Rule--The BLM announced its final so-called
``Conservation and Landscape Health'' rule (Public Lands Rule) on April
18, 2024.\63\ The Public Lands Rule will fundamentally upend the
agency's longstanding, statutory multiple use and sustained yield
mandate and cede control of federal lands to wealthy elites and
environmental extremists. The final rule, published on May 9, 2024,
will broadly allow the BLM to lease lands under new and vaguely defined
restoration and mitigation leases and change standards around land use
decisions. If the administration determines uses authorized under
FLPMA, such as grazing, energy production, mining, or recreation, are
incompatible with a lease, land health standards, or an Area of
Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), those uses would not be allowed.
They could be prohibited indefinitely from those lands. This would
effectively lock up lands for multiple uses, including potential
historic uses of the land. To prevent such abuses, Representative
Curtis introduced H.R. 3397, the ``Western Economic Security Today
(WEST) Act'' in May of 2023. The bill, which would prevent the BLM from
implementing the final rule, passed the House of Representatives with a
bipartisan vote on April 30, 2024.\64\

Biden Border Crisis--President Biden's policies continue
exacerbating the southern border crisis. Some of the most dangerous
areas along the U.S.-Mexico border are the estimated 693 miles of
federal land, representing approximately 35 percent of the total 1,965
miles of the southern border.\65\ Of this total, BLM managed 172.8
miles, or roughly 25 percent, of federal borderlands.\66\ Although the
federal government seeks to protect the ecological and recreational
value of these lands, such areas are often targeted by criminals, drug
smugglers, and human traffickers because they are remote, thinly
populated, and less frequently patrolled.\67\ The illegal dumping of
trash and wildfires sparked by campfires from illegal border crossers
threatens wildlife, destroy habitat, and deprive the public of access
to federally owned lands.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\65\ Note: This estimate ranges from 632 miles to 820 miles.

Despite the increasing severity of the Biden Border Crisis, the
word ``border'' appears just once in the entire 260-page DOI budget
document, specifically with reference to a $1 million investment in
water infrastructure along the Texas border and a $11 million reduction
in requested funds for ``Unites States/Mexico Border Issues--Technical
Support.'' In contrast, the word ``climate'' appears 128 times, and the
word ``justice'' appears 33 times (usually in reference to racial and
environmental justice).\68\ Within the BLM budget, the word ``border''
only appears one time in the context of the southern border. The BLM's
only proposed increase for law enforcement along the southern border is
$250,000 to hire a Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness
Coordinator.\69\

Forest and Rangeland Health--While the BLM's budget proposes $11.03
million for Public Domain Forest Management, an increase of $276,000,
most of this increase comes from rising fixed costs. The budget
actually proposes a $63,000 decrease in forest management, which ``will
result in slightly fewer acres treated'' compared to FY 2023 and a
reduction of 50,000 for seedlings re-planted.\70\ Perhaps even more
concerningly, the BLM budget proposes reducing timber outputs by 19
percent in Western Oregon ``to focus on protection of mature and old-
growth forests and improving forest health and fire resilience.'' \71\
This exemplifies the misguided and unscientific approach the Biden
administration has taken to managing old-growth forests. In fact, the
administration's own report on old-growth forests found that wildfire,
insects, and diseases were the leading threats to old-growth forests,
and ``tree cutting'' generally ``improved or maintained'' managed
stands.\72\

National Park Service

Overview--NPS manages 429 park units covering over 85 million acres
in all 50 U.S. states and territories.\73\ Unlike the BLM, which
manages lands for multiple use, NPS manages units of the National Park
System ``to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects
and the wildlife therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same
in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the
enjoyment of future generations.'' \74\ NPS's FY 2025 budget requests
$3.58 billion in discretionary funding, an increase of $101.1 million
over FY 2024 CR levels.\75\ This will support an estimated 19,953 FTEs,
an increase of 134 employees.

Deferred Maintenance Backlog--Deferred maintenance at sites and
facilities throughout the National Park System has proven to be a
perennial issue plaguing NPS despite unprecedented investments from the
Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA). Four years after GAOA's passage,
the NPS backlog has inexplicably risen from $12.7 billion in FY 2019 to
$23.3 billion at the end of FY 2023 (the most recent year for which
data is available), a staggering $10.6 billion increase.\76\ Between FY
2022 and FY 2023, the backlog rose by nearly $1 billion.\77\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\76\ Id. p. SpecEx-2.
\77\ Id.

One of the most perplexing questions about NPS's rising deferred
maintenance backlog is the agency's methodology to track and report
deferred maintenance projects. Earlier this year, the DOI Inspector
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
General testified before the subcommittee that:

NPS was unable to effectively identify and manage its deferred
maintenance, in large part due to inaccurate and unreliable
data. Furthermore, the NPS applied a blanket 35 percent markup
to its FY 2021 deferred maintenance, which resulted in a $3.7
billion increase to the estimated costs of the NPS' deferred
maintenance in just one year.\78\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\78\ House Natural Resources Committee, Testimony Greenblatt,
https://naturalresources. house.gov/uploadedfiles/
testimony_greenblatt.pdf.

In its FY 2025 budget justification, NPS stated that it ``continued
to transition assets to the new methodology,'' although it is unclear
when the methodology will fully be put into place.\79\ If NPS continues
to have unreliable and inconsistent data on its backlog, both the
agency and Congress will be unable to appropriately address the issue
or provide meaningful solutions.

For FY 2025, NPS listed 50 priority projects to receive the final
round of GAOA funding.\80\ Included in the priority project request was
$40 million in repairs for the Gateway National Recreation Area in New
York, the same unit that the Biden administration is currently using to
house thousands of illegal immigrants.\81\ It is unclear whether any of
these funds will be used to construct or improve housing for illegal
migrants or how much the misguided decision to use NPS facilities for
migrant housing exacerbated any deferred maintenance issues. The
priority project list also included $45 million in repairs for the
White House. Rather than focusing funding on crown jewels, the
administration is once again spending tens of millions of taxpayer
dollars in liberal, urban centers like Washington, DC. Concerningly,
the project list allocates more than $97 million for the ``Contingency
Fund.'' The Contingency Fund is designed to ``address cost increases,
unforeseen site conditions, and adapt project methods'' in addition to
supporting ``successful completion of major [Legacy Restoration Fund
(LRF)] projects that encounter challenges, ensuring projects are not
delayed.'' \82\ The $97 million allocated for the Contingency Fund is
higher than all other 50 projects on the priority list and represents 8
percent of the total amount for FY 2025 projects. Given the 35 percent
markup NPS has already applied to each deferred maintenance project, it
is concerning that the agency is overestimating and overinflating the
cost of individual projects.

Facility Operation and Maintenance--One of the most concerning
aspects of NPS's budget is a $25 million decrease in repair and
rehabilitation projects in the Facility Operation and Maintenance
account. Instead, this account proposes $3.1 million for ``Increasing
Representation on Our Public Lands.'' \83\ Repair and rehabilitation
projects are critical to ``address complex repair needs that arise on
an infrequent or non-recurring basis'' and ``halting or correcting
deterioration where preventive maintenance is no longer sufficient to
maintain the condition of the facility or infrastructure.'' \84\ By
decreasing funding for these vital maintenance projects to ``preserve
funding for Administration priorities,'' NPS is only ensuring that the
deferred maintenance backlog will continue to grow.\85\

Centennial Challenge--The budget proposes a $2 million reduction
for the Centennial Challenge Fund, a popular and successful public-
private partnership that matches federal funding 1:1, at a minimum,
with private donations. These projects ``repair and modernize NPS
infrastructure, expand recreational opportunities and access to the
public, and develop new and improved educational and interpretive
programs for visitors.'' \86\ The budget estimates that this reduction
will result in eight fewer projects being completed nationwide. Once
again, the budget justifies this decrease through the vague rationale
of ``preserv[ing] funding for Administration priorities.'' \87\
Reducing funding for the Centennial Challenge Fund will hamper efforts
to increase access to our nation's parks and reduce the deferred
maintenance backlog.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outdoor Recreation and Visitation--Visitation throughout the
National Park System continues to rise as hundreds of millions of
people across the globe travel annually to experience the unparalleled
scenery that so many of our nation's crown jewels have to offer.
Visitation totaled over 325 million in 2023, marking the fourth year of
consecutive growth.\88\ Recreation visits are up 11 percent compared to
the beginning of the decade.\89\ In 2022, visitors spent $23.9 billion
in local gateway communities, supporting 378,000 jobs, $29 billion in
economic value added, and $50.3 billion in total economic output.\90\
Unfortunately, the FY 2025 budget proposal is largely silent on how NPS
will work to maximize partnerships with rural gateway communities. Even
more concerningly, the budget proposes a $9.0 million decrease in the
National Recreation and Preservation account. Most of these cuts are to
programs that assist local communities, including gateway communities
that face significant challenges.

In contrast to this approach, Committee Republicans are committed
to expanding access to outdoor recreation opportunities on our nation's
public lands. Chairman Westerman's ``Expanding Public Lands Outdoor
Recreation Experiences (EXPLORE) Act'' is bipartisan, bicameral
legislation that streamlines permitting processes for small businesses,
improves visitor experiences, and increases access and opportunities
for recreation.\91\ The bill would also address the pressing needs of
gateway communities, including overcrowding and a lack of affordable
housing. It successfully passed the House last month by voice vote.

Biden Border Crisis--NPS manages approximately 195.1 miles along
the Southern border, or 28 percent of federal borderland.\92\ This is
the largest share of federal borderlands among all federal land
management agencies. Despite this footprint, the NPS budget only
proposes a paltry $8,000 increase for the Southwest Border Resource
Protection Program. The NPS budget admits border security is a prolific
problem, with individual units ``consistently experience[ing] serious
resource damage due to illegal crossborder activities traversing the
parks.'' \93\ The budget goes on to state that: ``thousands of miles of
unauthorized roads and trails have been created, major ecological
processes and the migration patterns of wildlife have been disrupted,
important historic sites have been vandalized, and archeological sites
have been looted.'' \94\

Housing--As housing costs continue to rise nationwide, finding
affordable housing for NPS employees has become increasingly
challenging. This burdens the agency's recruitment efforts and makes it
difficult to retain park staff. In March 2023, Director Sams testified
before the House Appropriations Committee, highlighting the declining
workforce at NPS.\95\ The FY 2025 budget request only allocated $9.0
million in new funding for additional employee housing while providing
$4.2 million for Zero Emission Vehicles.\96\ Given the important
implications of this issue for the agency's overall success, it is
concerning that NPS is devoting millions of dollars to frivolous and
inefficient climate goals rather than basic necessities for its
employees.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. TOM TIFFANY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN

Mr. Tiffany. Welcome, Director Stone-Manning and Director
Sams, back to the Committee to discuss the National Park
Service and Bureau of Land Management's budget request for
Fiscal Year 2025.
It is unsurprising, although still disappointing, that
President Biden's budget is once again underwhelming. It
features more of the same radical priorities, broken promises,
and extreme proclamations that we have seen from this
Administration over the past 3 years. These priorities are out
of line with the American people and the communities, families,
and small businesses that live and operate closest to Federal
lands.
With alarming consistency, these budget requests cater to
environmental extremists at the expense of local communities
who depend on access to Federal lands for their way of life.
They double down on the Biden administration's commitment to
American prosperity and energy independence, and pick winners
and losers based on ideological concerns.
The budgets allow unelected DC bureaucrats to enact their
radical agendas without any accountability from the people they
serve, all from the comfort of their home offices.
The BLM has drifted so far from its mission that it has
become unrecognizable. It is transforming into the Bureau of
Land Mismanagement.
Before me today are eight rules and land use plans that the
BLM recently published in the Federal Register. Together, they
comprise 6,290 pages of rules and regulations that the BLM
rushed to get out, instead of meaningfully listening to and
coordinating with local stakeholders. The only people happy
with that stack out in fly-over land in America are the paper
mills.
Each one of these documents claims to protect ecological
and sensitive resources on Federal lands. However, these are
little more than thinly veiled attempts to lock up millions of
acres of land from multiple uses and shirk the agency's
statutory multiple use mandate. These rules and land use plans
harm rural America, make us less energy independent, and
threaten our national security.
Today, we will address this shift away from
congressionally-mandated uses of the land to partisan
priorities, which include a decrease in forest management to
increase environmental justice efforts; a backlog of deferred
maintenance that has been allowed to grow out of control so the
agencies can buy more electric vehicles; and ranchers, energy
producers, and outdoor recreationists getting pushed off their
land so that they can be locked up indefinitely in the name of
preservation.
We will also talk about the complete dereliction of duty
the Department of the Interior has committed with respect to
Federal lands along the southern border. If ecological and
resource protections are so critical, then the agencies must
address the enormous environmental degradation that is
occurring at the southern border.
Combined, the National Park Service and Bureau of Land
Management account for 53 percent of the Federal land along the
southern border. Trash from illegal immigrants, wildfires
sparked by migrant campsites, an abundance of illegal trails,
and the lack of safety for lawful visitors is astonishing. We
would never accept this level of destruction and vandalism on
our Federal lands anywhere else in the country, so why is it
acceptable on the southern border?
Despite the increasing severity of the Biden border crisis,
the word ``border'' appears just once in the context of the
southern border in the BLM's entire 364-page budget request.
The word ``climate'' appears 77 times, however, and the term
``environmental justice'' appears 11 times.
Today, we will also address the Administration's reckless
spending, particularly the failure of the National Park Service
to rein in the out-of-control deferred maintenance backlog.
Earlier this year, this Subcommittee heard testimony from
Interior's Inspector General, who described the Park Service's
accounting for deferred maintenance as akin to a house of cards
built upon a house of cards. The Fiscal Year 2025 budget
request does little to reassure Congress or the American people
that these issues have been resolved, let alone taken seriously
by the agency.
It should also go without saying that, after years of
complaints from states across the nation saying they weren't
having any projects funded, the Park Service would choose to
spend $45 million updating Joe Biden's home.
While that is the bad news, the good news is that we have
recently passed a host of bills on the House Floor with
bipartisan support to reverse these troubling trends. They
include the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act to secure mining in
this country; the Alaska's Right to Produce Act, which reverses
a harmful decision limiting oil and gas production in Alaska;
the WEST Act to stop an illegal, vague rule that will upend the
multiple uses of BLM land; the Superior National Forest
Restoration Act, which would facilitate the permitting of a
very important mine in Congressman Stauber's district; and
finally, the EXPLORE Act, which would cut red tape for small
recreation businesses and improve outdoor access.
Having Democrats join Republicans on each of these bills to
stop the out-of-control preservationists and hurtful policies
of the Biden administration should be a wake-up call, but I
fear it won't be. Leadership in DC must listen to local
stakeholders, engage meaningfully with communities, and, above
all, follow your mandatory coordination requirements.
House Natural Resources Committee Republicans will continue
holding the Administration accountable, demanding answers, and,
when needed, passing legislation to stop harmful decisions.

With that, I yield back and recognize the Ranking Member,
Mr. Neguse, for his opening statement.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. JOE NEGUSE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO

Mr. Neguse. I thank the Chairman. I want to thank both of
the witnesses for being here today for this important hearing.
I would be remiss if I just did not take one moment to note
my strong disagreement with a number of statements made by the
Chairman. Only in Washington can colleagues of mine on the
other side of the aisle rationally argue that the budget
proposed to fund these incredibly important land management
agencies are, I think the word that was used was underwhelming,
after having voted against the appropriation bills that funded
the very agencies that we are discussing today. Only in
Washington.
House Democrats have been working for years to appropriate
sufficient resources so that the hard-working people at the BLM
and the National Park Service can do the important work that
they are statutorily authorized and compelled to do; so that
the hard-working folks who are at the BLM in Colorado, just by
way of example, the western headquarters in Grand Junction in
my district, and across our great country can continue doing
their important work.
It is shameful, in my view, that House Republicans, not
all, certainly most members of this particular Subcommittee,
including the Chairman, and most members of the Full Committee,
have chosen a different course. I understand that they have
disagreements with respect to particular priorities that the
Biden administration is pursuing. That is their prerogative.
But the caustic way in which these two agencies have been
described by my colleagues, I think, is deeply unfortunate.
I, for one, am grateful to have both Director Sams from the
National Park Service and Director Stone-Manning from the
Bureau of Land Management here with us today to talk about the
important missions of your respective agencies and the work
that you are doing to be stewards for our national parks and
our public lands.
I want to say that, again, while I think we can argue,
disagree, and discuss interpretations of the two management
frameworks with respect to both of your agencies, and, of
course, members of this Subcommittee and the Full Committee
have been doing so for decades, I am grateful for the work that
you two are doing and the Biden administration is doing more
broadly to manage our public lands with future generations in
mind. I think that is important. It matters a great deal for
our children, for my 5-year-old daughter, for future
generations to come.
It is the same approach that we took in the 117th Congress,
when I chaired this Subcommittee. We worked to ensure that we
would invest billions of dollars into the future of our public
lands. And it is unfortunate, as I said, in my view, that my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen a
different course, have not scheduled a single hearing in this
Subcommittee, for example, to even discuss the climate crisis.
I think that is unfortunate. Instead, they have done the
opposite. They pursued any number of policies that ultimately
would put polluters over the people that we are here to serve.
At BLM, Director Stone-Manning, your agency has advanced
rules that ensure public lands are managed for the greater
good, putting conservation on par with other uses, and
advancing a framework to promote renewable energy. Now, I don't
know if, in the stack of regulations here, this prop that the
Chairman has decided he will use for this hearing, which I
think is beneath this Subcommittee, but nonetheless I don't
know if included in this package are the regulations pertaining
to the Thompson Divide. I hope so, because I will tell you that
my constituents in Colorado are deeply grateful, deeply
grateful for the actions that the BLM took to protect the
Thompson Divide.
And as I said, while I recognize that we can have
reasonable disagreements about the extent or propriety or depth
of some of these particular policies and programs that the BLM
and the NPS are implementing, I hope we can do so with a degree
of respect for the witnesses who are here and for the agencies
that they represent.
I want to say thank you to both of you and your respective
workforces, and I look forward to the conversation.
I yield back.

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you for the opening statement, Ranking
Member Neguse. I now recognize the Chairman of the Full
Committee, Mr. Westerman.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS

Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Chairman Tiffany.
Thank you, Director Sams and Director Stone-Manning, for
appearing before the Committee today.
As Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, I have
focused on advancing policies that achieve four primary
objectives, and those are access, conservation, innovation, and
transparency. When it comes to the Biden administration's
policies and the proposed budget, it seems like there is almost
an antithesis of these values. And instead of promoting access
to our public lands, the Administration is locking up millions
of acres of land and resources, making it harder to produce
energy, graze cattle, and feed our families.
And we have to maintain and restore access. And I realize
that there are forces above the levels that you all work in the
Federal Government, and you are being good soldiers and doing
your job in the positions that you are in. But for the sake of
our Federal lands, we need to actively manage them for multiple
uses that they offer, whether that be energy development,
outdoor recreation, timber harvesting, or wildlife habitat.
And I will state it again: Conservation is an ethic. It is
not a use, as this Administration is trying to create a new
lexicon. Conservation should be at the core of what we do, not
a misinformed headline that has no substance but sounds good to
the casual listener.
Conservation has taken a hit in this Administration, but
the policies that we advance in this Committee can help right
the ship. This includes the WEST Act, which nullifies the BLM's
Public Lands Rule, as well as the EXPLORE Act, which expands
outdoor recreation access.
Both of these pieces of legislation passed with bipartisan
support earlier this year.
While the budget is just a wish list that is never actually
going to become law, we can't lose sight of the fact that
policies concocted here in DC have a real effect on the local
communities closest to those lands. I have seen that firsthand
with the proposed renovations at the Buckstaff Bathhouse in my
district. Originally, the Park Service proposed renovating the
bathhouse in a manner that would lay off 37 employees. And I
appreciate Secretary Haaland and Director Sam's recent
commitments to work with Buckstaff to ensure that we avoid that
kind of an outcome.
I look forward to hearing the testimony today, and look
forward to hearing the questions.
With that, I yield back.

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We will now move on
to witness testimony.
I would like to remind the witnesses that under Committee
Rules, you must limit your oral statement to 5 minutes, but
your entire statement will appear in the hearing record.
To begin your testimony, press the ``on'' button on the
microphone.
We use timing lights. When you begin, the light will turn
green. At the end of 5 minutes, the light will turn red, and I
will ask you to please complete your statement.
First, I would like to introduce Ms. Tracy Stone-Manning,
Director of the Bureau of Land Management.
Director Stone-Manning, you have 5 minutes for your
testimony.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. TRACY STONE-MANNING, DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF
LAND MANAGEMENT, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, WASHINGTON,
DC

Ms. Stone-Manning. Thank you, Chairman Westerman, Chairman
Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the
Subcommittee. I am Tracy Stone-Manning, the Director of the
Bureau of Land Management. Thank you for the opportunity to
testify on the Fiscal Year 2025 budget priorities and the
mission of the BLM.
We are the nation's largest land manager, responsible for 1
in 10 acres in this country. The multiple-use, sustained-yield
mission established by the Federal Land Policy and Management
Act, or FLPMA, directs us to sustain the health, diversity, and
productivity of 245 million acres of public lands and 700
million acres of mineral estate for multiple uses. These lands
provide food, fiber, minerals, energy, clean water, habitat,
and lifetime memories for countless families.
We owe a great deal of gratitude to the nearly 10,000 BLM
civil servants that do the hard work of balancing our mission
day in and day out.
In Fiscal Year 2022, public lands managed by the BLM
supported $262 billion in economic output and 1 million jobs.
In addition, last year public lands generated more than $9.6
billion in revenue. The country's economic return on its
investment in the BLM is remarkable. For each dollar Congress
provided us in Fiscal Year 2023, we generated $6 in revenue, 6
to 1. And, of course, this return does not consider how we pay
forward to the future in our work to conserve, protect, and
restore public lands and waters for the benefit of current and
future generations.
The President's Fiscal Year 2025 budget request of $1.6
billion ensures that we can meet our multiple use and sustained
yield responsibilities under FLPMA. While the budget request
advances many important Administration priorities, I will focus
on two: prioritizing landscape health and resilience, and the
transition to a clean energy economy.
The budget request proposes continued investments to
prioritize the health and resilience of public lands and waters
that are increasingly facing impacts of climate change,
including prolonged drought, increased spread of invasive
weeds, and more frequent and intense wildland fires. The budget
requests $317.4 million to improve the health of public lands
through restoration efforts, including eradicating and
controlling invasive species and re-establishing native plant
communities.
Each of the landscape health activities supported by the
budget request is key in supporting the multiple use and
sustained yield of our public lands into the future, helping to
improve the health and resilience of public lands and conserve
important wildlife habitat as we facilitate responsible
development. That approach of managing so that present and
future generations can enjoy the benefits of our public lands
is a through line in all of our work and in the rulemakings we
have recently finalized.
How we approach the future of energy is also central in
that work. President Biden has asked us to ensure an
electricity sector free of carbon pollution by 2035 and
economy-wide by 2050, and our public lands play an important
role in that effort. The budget proposes $53 million to support
siting, leasing, and oversight of renewable energy projects and
transmission lines on public lands which provide excellent
solar, wind, and geothermal energy potential.
During this Administration, the BLM has approved over 7.3
gigawatts of renewable energy projects, helping to surpass the
Administration's goal of permitting 25 gigawatts of clean
energy projects on public lands by 2025. We also leased lands
in solar energy zones that will yield another 2 gigawatts. To
help foster the work, the BLM published the final Renewable
Energy Rule earlier this month, which will lower consumer
energy costs, improve project application processes, and
incentivize developers to continue responsibly developing solar
and wind projects on our public lands.
While the BLM has made great progress transitioning to the
clean energy future, oil and gas production continues to be a
substantial part of the BLM's energy portfolio. Our work has
ensured that conventional energy development is as
environmentally responsible as possible, and that it provides a
fair return to the American taxpayer. To that end, BLM recently
published the first comprehensive update to the onshore oil and
gas leasing regulations in many decades. This update implements
congressional direction in the Inflation Reduction Act and will
help protect critical wildlife habitat, cultural resources, and
recreation.
We also finalized a rule to ensure that we reduce the
wasteful practice of venting or flaring natural gas.
Both of these efforts are key in helping to modernize the
oil and gas program, and ensuring it is fair to the American
taxpayer for whom the BLM stewards our public lands.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I
welcome any questions you may have.

[The prepared statement of Ms. Stone-Manning follows:]
Prepared Statement of Tracy Stone-Manning, Director, Bureau of Land
Management, U.S. Department of the Interior

Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and Members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on the
Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Budget priorities and mission of the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM). The BLM's 2025 Budget proposal supports the
critical role the Bureau plays in achieving the environmental,
conservation, and economic goals of the Biden-Harris Administration,
while working in partnership with thousands of communities nationwide,
mostly across the American West and in Alaska.
Introduction

Managing the BLM's portfolio of approximately 245 million acres of
surface land and 700 million acres of subsurface mineral estate on
behalf of the American people is a tremendous honor. As directed by the
Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), the BLM
sustains the health, diversity, and productivity of the nation's public
lands for multiple uses, such as conventional and renewable energy
development; livestock grazing; conservation; mining; watershed
protection; and hunting, fishing, and other forms of recreation. This
multiple-use, sustained yield mission demands a thoughtful, science-
based approach to management of our public lands and waters, as it
enables the BLM to sustain the economy, create jobs, and produce
domestic energy, while generating revenues for Federal and state
treasuries. The BLM is also charged with conserving, protecting, and
restoring public land resources and nationally significant landscapes
for the benefit of current and future generations. To advance this
broad mission as pressures increase on our public lands, the BLM
recently announced new rules to help protect critical wildlife habitat,
cultural resources, and recreational values, and ensure a fair return
for American taxpayers. Combined, these rules will guide balanced
management of America's public for decades to come.
America's public lands are strong economic drivers, and the BLM's
work contributes significantly to the national economy as well as the
financial health of the States where BLM lands and resources are
located. According to the BLM's estimates, activities associated with
BLM-managed public lands and minerals contributed an estimated $262
billion to the nation's economic output, supporting approximately one
million jobs in FY 2022.\1\ In terms of receipts, in FY 2023,
productive uses of BLM-managed public lands generated more than $9.6
billion, including a significant share for the States where the
revenues were generated. The country's economic return on its annual
discretionary appropriations investment in public lands is remarkable:
more than six dollars are generated for each dollar provided to the
BLM.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Overview

The Bureau's FY 2025 Budget requests $1.6 billion, including $1.4
billion for the Management of Lands and Resources (MLR) appropriation
and $120.8 million for the Oregon and California Grant Lands (O&C)
appropriation--the BLM's two main operating accounts.

The BLM's FY 2025 Budget request advances the Administration's
priorities in the following areas:

Strengthening climate resilience by investing in landscape
health;

Facilitating the transition to a clean energy economy;

Enhancing and expanding outdoor recreation;

Improving the management of wild horses and burros;

Conserving and protecting nationally significant
landscapes;

Strengthening Tribal sovereignty and self-determination;
and

Supporting underserved and disproportionately affected
communities.

Strengthening Climate Resilience by Investing in Landscape Health

The FY 2025 Budget request demonstrates the BLM's enduring
commitment to addressing the impacts of climate change by continuing to
prioritize investments that promote the health and resilience of public
lands and waters that are increasingly facing those impacts, including
prolonged drought, increased spread of invasive species, and more
frequent and intense wildland fires. For example, the Budget requests
$317.4 million under the BLM's Land Resources activity to improve the
health of public lands through restoration efforts, including
eradicating and controlling invasive species and re-establishing native
plant communities. Efforts to improve landscape health supported by
this request will complement the Bureau's ongoing ecosystem restoration
and resilience work, including activities funded through the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act--more commonly referred to as
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)--and the Inflation Reduction
Act (IRA).
In addition to $11 million for the Public Domain Forest Management
program, the Budget requests $105.8 million in the BLM's Western Oregon
Resources Management program. Combined, these funds will support timber
sales, help restore forest structure and composition to improve
wildfire and climate resilience, identify and manage carbon sinks, and
implement projects for reforestation and to protect mature and old-
growth forests.
The FY 2025 Budget requests $153.4 million in the BLM's Wildlife
Habitat Management program to identify, protect, conserve, and restore
wildlife habitat; maintain and improve wildlife corridors and habitat
connectivity; enhance ecosystem diversity; and improve drought
preparedness and response. Together, these efforts will help respond to
the effects of climate change on priority wildlife and plant species
and habitats. This program supports the development of the native seed
supply chain, the foundational underpinning of all of the BLM's land
restoration efforts, and provides significant support to conserve
greater sage-grouse and sagebrush habitat. This work is bolstered by
one-time funding provided by the BIL and IRA and coordination with many
Federal, State, Tribal and other partners. The Budget request also
includes $59.9 million for BLM's Aquatic Resources program to enable
the Bureau to continue to work to conserve remaining high-quality lands
and waters, restore degraded land and water resources, and ensure the
connectivity of these systems.
Each of the landscape health activities supported by the FY 2025
Budget request will be complemented by the Conservation and Landscape
Health Rule, which the BLM finalized on May 9, 2024. Informed by more
than 200,000 comments from individual Americans, State and local
governments, Tribes, industry groups, and advocacy organizations, the
final rule will support multiple use and sustained yield of the public
lands into the future, helping to improve the health and resilience of
public lands in the face of a changing climate, conserve important
wildlife habitat and intact landscapes, facilitate responsible
development, and better recognize unique cultural and natural resources
on public lands. The FY 2025 Budget also supports the Administration's
America the Beautiful initiative, a ten-year, locally led effort to
protect, conserve, connect, and restore the lands, waters, and wildlife
upon which we all depend.
Facilitating the Transition to a Clean Energy Economy

As conventional energy sources continue to play an important role
in our economy, the BLM is advancing the development of renewable
energy by providing sites on public lands for environmentally sound
renewable energy production and transmission projects. BLM-managed
public lands provide excellent solar, wind, and geothermal energy
potential and are an important component of the Administration's
broader strategy to rapidly reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at
least 50 percent by 2030 and achieve a carbon pollution-free
electricity sector by 2035.
Consistent with the Energy Act of 2020, the BLM continues to
accelerate responsible permitting of renewable energy projects on
public lands. Since January 21, 2021, the BLM has permitted projects
that are expected to produce over 7.3 gigawatts of clean energy--enough
to power over 2.8 million homes. In addition to specific project
approvals, the BLM has also leased eight new areas in Solar Energy
Zones with the capacity to generate nearly 2.5 gigawatts of additional
clean energy. These efforts contributed to the Administration recently
surpassing its goal of permitting 25 gigawatts of clean energy projects
on BLM-administered public lands by 2025. As of April 2024, the BLM is
currently processing 65 utility-scale onshore clean energy projects--
including solar, wind, geothermal, and transmission interconnect
projects--with a combined potential to add approximately 32,500
megawatts of renewable energy. The BLM is also undertaking the
preliminary review of almost 200 applications for solar and wind
development, as well as almost 100 applications for solar and wind
energy testing.
In addition, on May 1, 2024, the BLM finalized its Rights-of-Way,
Leasing and Operations for Renewable Energy Rule, which will lower the
cost of developing solar and wind projects, improve renewable energy
project application processes, and incentivize developers to continue
to responsibly develop solar and wind projects on public lands.
Consistent with the Administration's commitment to create high-quality
jobs in the clean energy economy and support American manufacturing,
the final rule includes incentives for projects to use project labor
agreements and American-made materials.
The complexities involved with authorizing bulk energy generation
and the associated transmission lines necessitate extensive stakeholder
engagement and coordination and thorough environmental reviews of
project proposals. To that end, the FY 2025 Budget proposes $53.1
million in the Renewable Energy Management program to support siting,
leasing, processing rights-of-way applications, and oversight of
renewable energy projects and transmission lines on BLM-managed public
lands. The BLM expects renewable energy demand and workload to continue
to increase significantly as more utility companies and States seek to
diversify their energy sources or require increased amounts of
renewable energy in their electric power portfolios. Helping to drive
the expected demand is the nearly $400 billion in Department of Energy
loans for clean energy and transmission infrastructure enacted in the
IRA. This investment is anticipated to further increase permitting
workloads on Federal lands through at least 2030.
While the BLM has made great progress facilitating renewable energy
development, a substantial part of the BLM's energy portfolio consists
of oil and gas production from public lands. Since January 21, 2021,
the BLM has approved more than 11,000 new drilling permits--including
over 3,800 in 2023 alone--and onshore oil production from Federal lands
is at an all-time high. At the same time, the BLM has focused on
efforts to ensure that conventional energy development is
environmentally responsible and provides a fair return to the American
taxpayer.
On April 23, 2024, the BLM finalized its Fluid Mineral Leases and
Leasing Process Rule, which codifies fiscal provisions that were
enacted in the IRA. These changes revise outdated fiscal terms for the
onshore Federal oil and gas leasing program, including royalty rates
and minimum bids, and will increase returns to the public and
disincentivize speculation. The rule also strengthens bonding standards
to help ensure that taxpayers are not saddled with paying industry
cleanup costs. The rule is the BLM's first comprehensive update to the
federal onshore oil and gas leasing framework since 1988, the first
update to minimum bonding levels since 1960, and the first increase in
royalty rates in more than a century. The rule also implements
recommendations from the Department of the Interior's Report on the
Federal Oil and Gas Leasing Program and will guide BLM efforts to focus
oil and gas leasing in areas that are the most likely to be developed--
areas with existing infrastructure and high oil and gas potential--
providing transparency and clarity for industry, while better managing
public lands for other important uses.
Additionally, on April 10, 2024, the BLM finalized its Waste
Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation
Rule to curb the waste of natural gas during the production of oil and
gas on Federal and Tribal lands. The final rule modernizes regulations
that are more than 40 years old. The updates will help hold oil and gas
companies accountable by requiring operators to avoid wasteful
practices and find and fix leaks, while ensuring that American
taxpayers and Tribal mineral owners are fairly compensated through
royalty payments. By building on technological advances and best
management practices to help reduce waste, the rule is expected to
generate more than $50 million in additional natural gas royalty
payments each year to taxpayers and Tribal mineral owners, while
conserving billions of cubic feet of gas that might otherwise have been
vented, flared, or leaked from oil and gas operations.
Finally, given the importance of critical minerals to the clean
energy transition, the BLM is working across the Federal government to
update mining policies, strengthen permitting efficiency, and promote a
robust, environmentally and socially responsible domestic mining
industry. Some of these efforts, including much needed reforms to the
General Mining Law of 1872, will require the assistance of Congress.
The BLM looks forward to continuing to work with the Subcommittee on
this issue.
Enhancing & Expanding Recreation

The BLM is a key part of connecting Americans to the outdoors, as
more than 120 urban centers and thousands of rural towns are located
within 25 miles of BLM-managed public lands and waters. Public lands
and waters are widely recognized as a ``backyard to backcountry''
treasure, affording a variety of accessible recreation opportunities--
from neighborhood trails to world-class destinations and a diverse mix
of camping, boating, off-highway vehicle riding, recreational shooting,
horseback riding, hunting, fishing, wildlife viewing, and many others.
As a result of the unique opportunities, resources, and experiences
our public lands offer, recreational use has skyrocketed. In FY 2023,
the BLM recorded more than 82 million visits, representing a 41 percent
increase in use since 2012, with almost a third of that increase
occurring since 2020. In response to this significant growth in
recreation, the BLM last year released its Blueprint for 21st Century
Outdoor Recreation (Blueprint), which is intended to guide investments,
partnerships, outreach, and program development, so the Bureau can more
effectively respond to current demand and chart a course to meet future
needs. The FY 2025 Budget request for the Recreation Resources
Management program is $61.5 million to implement the Blueprint; enhance
and increase access to recreational opportunities, including access by
disadvantaged or underserved communities; and maintain, repair, and
construct recreational trails, facilities (including campgrounds, day-
use areas, and trailheads), kiosks, and directional signs. The request
will also support recreation site and trail design improvements to
mitigate recreation conflicts with sensitive natural resources, such as
by altering traffic and concentrated use patterns.
Improving the Management of Wild Horses & Burros

The overpopulation of wild horses and burros across the West
continues to present unique challenges to the BLM's ability to improve
and maintain landscape health. As of March 2024, there were
approximately 73,500 wild horses and burros across the 177 herd
management areas that the BLM administers--exceeding the nationwide
appropriate management level (AML) of 27,000 animals by over 46,500. Of
the 177 herd management areas, almost 80 percent are above AML. The
Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 requires that the BLM
manage wild horses and burros in a manner ``designed to achieve and
maintain a thriving natural ecological balance on public lands,'' and
the AML is the population range the BLM sets to best maintain that
thriving natural ecological balance. The BLM has worked diligently in
the last few years to address this problem, reducing the on-range
population from a peak of 95,000 wild horses and burros in 2020 to
approximately 73,500 today, but we have more work to do. Climate
change-induced lack of forage and water, as well as competition among
wild horses and burros, big game species, and livestock over these
limited resources, have made it even more difficult for the BLM to
maintain this necessary ecological balance, resulting in further
degradation of the range and undermining other BLM land health
investments.
The BLM is focused on addressing the management challenges with
this program, particularly through use of fertility control treatments
and permanent sterilization efforts and through private placements of
animals. However, the substantial growth in the cost of off-range
holding has impacted the BLM's ability to deliver fertility treatments
or remove wild horses and burros from the range while balancing the
obligations to ensure the wellbeing of the approximately 63,000 horses
off-range in our care (as of May 2024). The FY 2025 Budget requests
$170.9 million in the BLM's Wild Horse and Burro Management program,
which will help to offset rising program costs and conduct on-range and
off-range management activities. This includes a $15 million increase
to support permanent sterilizations. Given the substantial challenges
associated with the management of wild horses and burros in the face of
a changing climate, and the fact that about two-thirds of the program's
budget is now allocated to the care and feeding of horses off range,
the BLM would welcome the opportunity to work with the Subcommittee to
address the many challenges with this issue.
Conserving & Protecting Nationally Significant Landscapes

As specified in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, the
BLM's National Conservation Lands ``conserve, protect, and restore
nationally significant landscapes that have outstanding cultural,
ecological, and scientific values for the benefit of current and future
generations.'' The National Conservation Lands currently encompass 905
units covering over 37 million acres, including national monuments,
wilderness, wilderness study areas, wild and scenic rivers, national
conservation areas, and national scenic and historic trails. Designated
by Congress or the President, the National Conservation Lands represent
some of the nation's most spectacular landscapes and are also the
current and ancestral homelands of Tribal Nations and Indigenous
peoples, many of whom have deep cultural, historic, and spiritual
connections to these places.
An estimated 12.5 million people visit units of the National
Conservation Lands each year, providing significant economic benefits
to surrounding communities and sustaining long-term jobs within them.
To support the conservation and management of these special places, the
FY 2025 Budget requests $65.8 million in the BLM's National
Conservation Lands program, $19.6 million in the Wilderness Management
program, and $7.1 million in cross-cutting funds for wild and scenic
rivers.
Strengthening Tribal Sovereignty & Self-Determination

The BLM's management of heritage resources informs the public about
climate change and human interactions with the natural environment;
offers educational, interpretative, and recreational opportunities to
the public; and affirms public, Native American, and other descendent
community connections to the landscape. Under the Native American
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, the BLM has a
responsibility to identify Native American human remains, funerary
items, and objects of cultural significance in its museum collections
and consult with Tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations to repatriate
these remains and objects. The FY 2025 Budget includes an increase of
$250,000 in the Cultural Resources Management program to support and
expedite this critically important work.
Supporting Underserved & Disproportionately Affected Communities

The impacts of climate change and environmental degradation in the
United States are not evenly distributed across our society.
Communities of color, low-income families, and rural and Indigenous
communities have long suffered disproportionate and cumulative harm
from air pollution, water pollution, and toxic sites. The BLM, as part
of its work, dedicates time and resources to engage a wide range of
stakeholders and communities in all its land management decisions, as
well as to conduct formal consultation with Tribes in recognition of
the Federal government's trust responsibilities.
The FY 2025 BLM Budget will advance the Administration's efforts to
create good-paying jobs through its program to remediate and reclaim
orphaned wells and abandoned mines. These jobs will support communities
that may have been disproportionately affected by energy and mining
activities and ease the transition for oil and gas field workers, coal
miners, and conventional energy and mining communities as the market
transitions toward cleaner energy sources. The FY 2025 request in the
BLM's Oil and Gas Management program includes over $23 million to
enable the agency to continue remediating wells on Alaska's North
Slope. The BLM expects to address orphaned oil and gas wells in the
Lower 48 states with funds provided by the BIL (through the
Department's Energy Community Revitalization Program), in addition to
annual appropriations. Plugging these wells will mitigate risks to
groundwater and air pollution. The request also includes $58.4 million
in the Abandoned Mine Lands and Hazardous Materials Management program
for the remediation of both physical and environmental impacts of
legacy abandoned mine lands and the prevention, mitigation, and
remediation of the effects of hazardous substance releases.
Conclusion

The BLM's FY 2025 proposed Budget reflects the Administration's
continued commitment to managing America's public lands in a balanced,
science-based manner. It is incumbent on us as stewards of our public
lands to ensure their use is sustainable and beneficial to current and
future generations of Americans, regardless of who they are or where
they live, and we take that responsibility seriously. I look forward to
working with the Subcommittee to ensure that the BLM has the tools and
resources necessary to achieve these important objectives. Thank you
for the opportunity to testify here today.

Questions Submitted for the Record to the Honorable Tracy-Stone
Manning, Director, Bureau of Land Management

The Honorable Tracy-Stone Manning did not submit responses to the
Committee by the appropriate deadline for inclusion in the printed
record.

Questions Submitted by Representative Westerman

Question 1. How much funding has the Bureau of Land Management
(BLM) spent to initiate, administer, and grow the 30x30 initiative?

Question 2. How many acres of federal lands under the BLM's
jurisdiction are already under some level of protected or restrictive-
use status?

Question 3. How will Congress know if the administration has
reached its 30x30 goal? Will you commit to promptly informing Congress
once the 30x30 goal is reached?

Question 4. What happens after the administration reaches its 30x30
goal?

Question 5. On conservation.gov, there is a diagram that summarizes
the Biden administration's ``preliminary framework for assessing
progress toward the nation's goal of conserving at least 30 percent of
U.S. lands and waters by 2030.'' Notably, BLM lands ``that are
conserved and restored'' are listed as only ``potential additions'' to
the ``National Conservation Goals.''

5a) How many acres of BLM lands are currently listed as ``potential
additions''?

5b) What data is required before this acreage can be added to the
``National Conservation Goals''?

5c) What steps has the BLM taken to get this acreage added to the
``National Conservation Goals''?

5d) What are the current uses of the specified BLM lands? Please
give a percentage breakdown of primary uses (e.g., x percent is
primarily used for wildlife habitat, y percent is primarily used for
timber harvesting, z percent is primarily used for grazing, etc.).

Question 6. The final Public Lands Rule states:

``Some commenters raised concerns about the ability of foreign
entities to use conservation leases to block development of
critical mineral or energy projects on public lands or to
obtain conservation leases near military bases or other
sensitive government installations.''

``In response to these and other comments on the potential use
of conservation leases in ways that would excessively interfere
with other uses or to intentionally block development, the BLM
clarified that restoration and mitigation leases may only be
issued for two discrete purposes: restoration of degraded
landscapes or mitigation to offset the impacts of
development.''

6a) To confirm, does this mean that the BLM will not issue a
restoration or mitigation lease to block development of critical
mineral or energy projects on public lands?

6b) Will the BLM commit to not issuing restoration or mitigation
leases near military bases or other sensitive government installations
to any entity?

Question 7. The final Public Lands Rule states that the BLM will
not issue any restoration or mitigation leases to foreign entities. The
rule also states that the BLM will use standard lease adjudication
processes to determine whether an applicant is a foreign entity. The
processes cited in the rule, however, say nothing about determining
whether an entity is foreign-controlled or not.

7a) What specific processes will you put in place to ensure that a
foreign entity--especially a bad actor, like China or Russia--will not
obtain a restoration or mitigation lease under the guise of a non-
profit or American entity? For example, U.S.A. Conservation Leasing
Group LLC may sound fine, but what if it's an entity funded by China?

7b) Does the BLM have employees who are trained to identify
foreign-owned or--controlled entities? If not, whom will the BLM use to
make such identifications?

7c) Will restoration and mitigation leases be subject to a
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) review?

7d) Has the BLM ever conducted a similar process before or will a
new system have to be put in place to verify these leases are not held
by foreign entities?

Question 8. Will the BLM commit to not issuing any restoration or
mitigation leases that would block development of critical mineral or
energy projects on public lands that are necessary to counter China's
influence?

Question 9. Can any citizen, group, organization, non-governmental
organization, or similar entity--assuming that it meets the minimum
requirements--apply for and potentially secure a restoration or
mitigation lease?

Question 10. Can the same leaseholder infinitely renew their
existing restoration or mitigation lease?

Question 11. What safeguards are there to prevent one of the many
anti-multiple-use groups from leasing federal lands to prevent wind and
solar development, transmission infrastructure, grazing, mining, or oil
and gas development?

Question 12. What safeguards are in place to keep the DOI from
identifying and leasing public lands for conservation that have
significant benefits for other multiple-use activities in an effort to
administratively bar those other activities from taking place?

Question 13. Please explain how restoration and mitigation leases
and required avoidance and mitigation portions of BLM's Public Lands
Rule will not preclude all other multiple-use activities on public
land?

Question 14. What does Section 103(l) of FLPMA say? How does the
BLM interpret this?

Question 15 The Public Lands Rule clarifies that conservation is a
use on par with other uses of public lands under FLPMA's multiple-use
and sustained yield framework.

15a) Can we expect additional and competing ``uses'' of public
lands out of this Administration?

15b) Will the BLM elevate another ``use?''

Question 16. Will each restoration and mitigation lease be subject
to a NEPA analysis?

Question 17. If a restoration lease is proposed on an area at high
risk for wildfire, will the BLM require the restoration lease to treat
the area to reduce its risk of wildfire?

Question 18. Will lease applications for restoration or mitigation
leases, or both, be public? Once approved, will leases for restoration
or mitigation be public?

Question 19. What guidance have you given state directors and field
managers on restoration and mitigation leases? What do they do if
someone walks in the door with a proposal for a restoration or
mitigation lease?

Question 20. Will this guidance be finalized and made available to
the Committee before June 10, 2024?

Question 21. Have you provided any direction to current users of
the land for what to expect concerning restoration and mitigation
leases?

Question 22. Have you provided any direction to any outside groups,
like environmental and non-profit organizations, concerning restoration
and mitigation leases?

Question 23. Will you commit to sharing information about the
process of the new leasing system with all current users of BLM land
when developed, not just to certain groups?

Question 24. The final Public Lands Rule states:

``Sec. 6102.5.1 Mitigation

(a) The BLM will apply the mitigation hierarchy to avoid,
minimize, and compensate, as appropriate, for adverse impacts
to resources when authorizing uses of public lands. As
appropriate, the authorized officer may identify specific
mitigation approaches or requirements to address resource
impacts through land use plans or in other decision
documents.''

24a) Are grazing permits included in the land uses that require
mitigation?

Question 25. Are there circumstances under which you believe that a
grazing permittee in good compliance with their permit and terms and
conditions would be required to mitigate their grazing management?

Question 26. Does the BLM consider grazing to be a form of
conservation?

Question 27. Does the BLM consider forest management to be a form
of conservation?

Question 28. The final rule references uses that it claims are
compatible with conservation, like ``sustainable recreation.''

28a) What is sustainable recreation?

28b) Which types of recreation does the BLM believe to be not
sustainable?

28c) Is rock climbing, including the use of fixed anchors, in a
wilderness area considered sustainable recreation under this
definition?

28d) Please provide a definition and example of unsustainable
recreation.

Question 29. Private investment in restoration and mitigation
leases will require an expectation of durability for the investor. Did
the BLM meet with potential investors in restoration and mitigation
leases before finalizing the Public Lands Rule?

Question 30. The rule provides for the agency to do landscape
health analyses for uses other than grazing but says that, until new
processes are developed for ecosystems other than rangeland, no
assessments shall occur. When does the agency expect assessments for
other ecosystems will be developed?

Question 31. Which BLM lands are available for a restoration or
mitigation lease? Will all 245 million acres of BLM land be available
for restoration or mitigation leases? If not, how is this distinction
between leasable and non-leasable BLM lands to be made?

Question 32. Pursuant to the final Public Lands Rule, would it be
possible to have a wilderness area in an ACEC in a national monument
and then issue a restoration lease on the land?

Question 33. The National Park Service (NPS) FY 2025 budget
justification states that illegal immigration along the Southern border
is a serious problem affecting our parks. Specifically, the NPS
document states that some of its units along the U.S.-Mexico border
``consistently experience serious resource damage due to illegal cross-
border activities traversing the parks.'' The budget goes on to say
that ``[t]housands of miles of unauthorized roads and trails have been
created, major ecological processes and the migration patterns of
wildlife have been disrupted, important historic sites have been
vandalized, and archeological sites have been looted.''

33a) Do you agree with the NPS's assessment that illegal
immigration is causing significant amounts of damage to our federal
border lands?

33b) Why is BLM's budget justification virtually silent on the
border?

Question 34. The U.S.-Mexico border has become the site of a large-
scale humanitarian disaster. How many migrants and suspected migrants
have perished on BLM lands along the U.S.-Mexico border since 2021?
Please provide annual data.

Question 35. In a response to the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee's Ranking Member Barrasso during your confirmation,
you promised: ``If I am confirmed as BLM Director, I will work with the
Department of Homeland Security and other relevant Departments and
agencies, as appropriate, to address border related issues on the
public lands.''

35a) Will you commit to meeting with Secretary Mayorkas this year
and discussing the environmental and resource degradation at federal
lands along the southern border?

35b) Have you met with CBP agents about how to improve operational
control of federal borderlands and protect the life and safety of
officers?

Question 36. From 2003 to 2016, BLM conducted the Southern Arizona
Project, in which the agency published detailed annual reports covering
the millions of pounds of trash that migrants and drug smugglers had
left along Arizona's border with Mexico. Why was this project
discontinued?

Question 37. In 2018, the Arizona Department of Environmental
Quality (ADEQ) estimated that each border crosser leaves behind
approximately six to eight pounds of trash. Since the number of
migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has reached record highs under
the Biden administration, does the BLM believe that the amount of trash
along the border has increased since 2016?

Question 38. How many pounds of trash did the BLM collect along the
U.S.-Mexico border in FY 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively?

Question 39. How many trash pick-up events did the BLM conduct
along the U.S.-Mexico border in each of those fiscal years?

Question 40. How much annual funding has been devoted to trash
collection along the U.S.-Mexico border in FY 2021, 2022, and 2023,
respectively?

Question 41. How much funding has the BLM requested for FY 2025 for
removing trash from BLM-administered lands along the U.S.-Mexico
border?

41a) How did the BLM decide to request this amount?

41b) Please describe, in detail, how the budget request corresponds
to increased migration and trash totals along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Question 42. The proposed BLM budget anticipates a decrease of $4
million in 2024 and into next year for recreation fees. There is also a
decrease of 3 full-time equivalents (FTE).

42a) Will you explain why the anticipated decrease in recreation
fees?

42b) Is this due to improving access and limiting feed or a
reduction in users of the land?

42c) Are the 3 FTE positions being eliminated or moved to another
area in BLM?

Question 43. The BLM Budget proposes $1 million for the BLM
Foundation established in P.L. 115-31.

43a) How was it determined that $1 million was the appropriate
amount?

43b) How will this money be spent?

Question 44. When the President designates a new national monument,
does the BLM receive funding to complete the resource management plan
(RMP)? If so, please list how much and from what source. If not, please
list where the BLM is reducing funding to compensate for the increased
need for national monuments.

Question 45. The BLM Budget states: ``In FY 2025, the BLM
anticipates completing approximately 15 RMPs and RMP amendments.'' Will
you provide a list of the 15 RMPs and RMP amendments the agency expects
to complete this year?

Question 46. On March 20, 2024, before the Subcommittee on Federal
Lands, Deputy Director Nada Wolf Culver admitted that she did not read
the testimony of Sweetwater County Land Use Director, Eric Bingham. On
May 1, 2024, when Representative Hageman asked Secretary Haaland if she
has heard of the Rock Springs Resource Management Plan (RMP), the
Secretary replied, ``No.'' The next day, Secretary Haaland read a
prepared response claiming she referred to it as the Sweetwater County
RMP. The official name in the Federal Register is ``Notice of
Availability of the Draft Resource Management Plan and Environmental
Impact Statement for the Rock Springs RMP Revision, Wyoming'' [emphasis
added]. The name ``Rock Springs'' appears 10 times more frequently in
the RMP than does the name ``Sweetwater.'' On May 15, Representative
Hageman asked if you had read the full draft Rock Springs RMP. You
replied, ``that's what my staff does.'' Sweetwater County and the State
of Wyoming continue to insist BLM has shut them out of the process and
has intentionally misled them. These three examples from Secretary
Haaland, Deputy Director Culver, and you only confirm their
accusations.

46a) Will you commit to reading the Rock Springs Resource
Management Plan in its entirety? If not, why not?

46b) Will you take any steps to address the concerns of the Wyoming
and Sweetwater County governments, which strongly oppose the BLM's
preferred alternative for the Rock Springs RMP Revision?

Question 47. How many Areas of Critical Environmental Concern
(ACECs) does the BLM manage? How many have completed RMPs?

Question 48. How many ACECs and National Conservation Areas (NCAs)
currently allow livestock grazing?

Question 49. How many ACECs and NCAs designations resulted in
removal of grazing activities, including cancellation of permits, in
the past 10 years?

Question 50. Energy projects of all kinds on federal lands are
routinely held up by lawsuits filed years after the BLM's NEPA process
concludes. These lawsuits, in many cases frivolous, foster uncertainty
among project developers and limit the potential of the public's energy
resources. Do you agree that a statutory limitation on when such
lawsuits may be filed would be a useful tool to promote the responsible
production of more American energy resources?

Question 51. What is the Bureau doing to expedite rights-of-way
approval for oil and gas infrastructure, like gathering lines, on
Federal lands?

Question 52. How many times has the Bureau used the gathering lines
categorical exclusion (CE) created by Congress?

Question 53. Must operators ask BLM to use the gathering lines CE
when submitting a right-of-way application?

Question 54. The BLM's new Waste Prevention rule requires operators
to either submit a Waste Minimization Plan including certification of a
valid, executed contract to sell the associated gas, or a self-
certification of 100 percent capture of associated gas with oil-well
APDs. How common is it for an operator to have an executed contract to
sell the associated gas on the date they submit their APD?

Question 55. The Final Waste Prevention regulation explains how the
BLM relies on venting and flaring data on oil wells from 1990 to 2000
to establish flaring thresholds. As you know, oil wells from the 1990's
are much different from modern, unconventional oil wells. Why would you
use data from the 1990's to establish standards when you have more
recent data?

Question 56. What evidence does BLM have that the Waste Prevention
rule will result in better capturing of methane than state rules?

Question 57. Why does BLM insist on refusing variances for state
rules that are effective in increasing the capture of methane, whether
that be for environmental purposes or financial purposes?

Question 58. According to the BLM's website there are currently 20
proposed renewable energy projects in the NEPA process. Do you look at
the lifecycle emissions for these projects as a part of the NEPA
analysis?

Question 59. In the BLM's Final Renewable Energy regulation it says
that the BLM will review and process applications, including on a non-
competitive basis, for proposed solar and energy generation rights-of-
way inside designated leasing areas.

59a) What is the process for awarding someone a lease on a non-
competitive basis?

59b) Is the public notified for awareness or for comment?

Question 60. Much like with the oil and gas industry, minerals
projects take significant lead-times to go from exploration to
operational mine, often taking decades for the federal permitting
process and litigation to play out. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence has
forecasted that, based on average mine size, 384 new mines are needed
by 2035 to meet the demand for electric vehicles and energy storage
batteries. Secretary Haaland recently told the House Natural Resources
Committee that, since 2021, the Biden administration has approved five
new mines requiring an Environmental Impact Statement, or the type of
mines that Benchmark is referring to in their forecasting. You
corrected the record in your testimony by indicating that one of the
mine approvals was actually done under the prior administration.

60a) Are the IWG Report recommendations--which propose fee
increases, new fees and royalties, restricted land access, and other
provisions on the domestic mining industry--sufficient to attract the
investment needed to support President Biden's mineral-heavy energy
transition goals?

60b) With only four mines approved since 2021, what is the Biden
administration doing to sufficiently build the pipeline of projects
needed to supply skyrocketing mineral demand in the future?

Question 61. In testimony before the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee last September, Dr. Daniel Yergin, the Vice
Chairman of S&P Global stated that based analysis, ``if you start a new
mine today, you wouldn't see production till 2040.''

Is the Biden administration appropriately positioned, with a
pipeline of domestic mining projects, to meet U.S. manufacturing,
infrastructure, energy and national security priorities now and in the
future?

Question 62. As Director, you oversee the permitting of the Burning
Man event on BLM land.

62a) Have you ever attended the Burning Man event either as
Director or before your current role as Director?

62b) Do you have plans to attend the Burning Man event in 2024?

Question 63. How much land does the BLM manage without a partner?

Question 64. How much land does the BLM manage with no lease
holder?

Question 65. When asked for an extension on the NPR-A regulation, a
BLM employee responded quote ``Yeah, I wish we could . . . In other
contexts we might have that kind of time, but I'm happy to regale you
with the ins and outs of the Congressional Review Act, but
unfortunately we're on a schedule with this one that we don't have any
control over, so we just don't have that kind of time for this rule.''

65a) Did you issue any kind of internal directive either formally
or informally to expedite comment periods in order to meet the
timelines of the Congressional Review Act at all costs?

65b) During the hearing, you mentioned the employee who said this
was no longer with the BLM. Was she fired due to making this statement?

Question 66. Is BLM able to fully comply with FLPMA section 512?

Question 67. Are there any regulations, land use plans, internal
manuals, memos, or policy documents that must be updated for BLM to
comply with section 512 of FLPMA?

Question 68. Are there any laws or congressionally directed actions
limiting compliance with section 512 of FLPMA?

Question 69. Will the BLM need to create a regulatory framework to
comply with section 512 of FLPMA? If so, when will this be complete?

Question 70. In a QFR response from last year's budget hearings,
the Department outlined its telework policy which states that ``an
employee approved to telework must physically report to their official
duty station at least two full workdays per bi-weekly pay period.''

70a) What percentage of employees met this benchmark every month
for the past year?

70b) Does the Field count as a duty station, or is the duty station
the office?

70c) If so, telework employees only have to either go into the
office or into the field two times every two weeks?

70d) How can the Bureau ensure appropriate customer service using
this model?

Question 71. BLM's Greater Sage-Grouse land use plan amendment
affects ten states, 121 million acres of BLM-administered public lands,
and 77 RMPs. The document covers highly complex protection measures
such as triggers, buffers, and density and disturbance caps, and
introduces extensive new scientific studies, including novel concepts
such as neighborhood and climate clusters and a Targeted Annual Warning
System that have not been sufficiently peer reviewed nor vetted with
cooperating agencies and the public.

How can BLM expect the public to read, comprehend, and
substantially comment on a 2,428-page document and the many associated
scientific studies within 90 days?

Question 72. In 2017, Congress struck down the BLM Planning 2.0
rule, partly because BLM attempted to eliminate both the local
administrative and local geographic focus of land use planning by
centralizing all planning authority in BLM's Washington DC headquarters
and allowing centralized land use planning efforts to have potentially
unlimited geographic scope. Despite that clear message from Congress
and the CRA's prohibition of an agency to issue ``a new rule that is
substantially the same'', BLM is attempting to do the same type of
centralized planning covering 121 million acres and ten states with the
Greater Sage-Grouse land use plan amendments.

72a) Do you believe that the manner in which these plans are being
developed violates BLM regulations under FLPMA and are contrary to
state and local government participation required by NEPA?

72b) Are you concerned that the plan may be legally vulnerable
under NEPA, FLPMA, APA, and CRA?

72c) Wouldn't it be better to develop appropriate state-based plans
for each of the ten states?

Question 73. Section 50625 (b)(1) of the Inflation Reduction Act
(IRA) states the following:

``(1) the Secretary may not issue a right-of-way for wind or solar
energy development on Federal land unless--(A) an onshore lease sale
has been held during the 120-day period ending on the date of the
issuance of the right-of-way for wind or solar energy development; and
(B) the sum total of acres offered for lease in onshore lease sales
during the 1-year period ending on the date of the issuance of the
right-of-way for wind or solar energy development is not less than the
lesser of--(i) 2,000,000 acres; and (ii) 50 percent of the acreage for
which expressions of interest have been submitted for lease sales
during that period;''

73a) Please provide the Committee with a list of all wind and solar
and wind projects (including acreages) that were issued rights-of-way
since the passage of the IRA, pursuant to this section, along with the
dates they were issued.

73b) BLM's website lists the status of active renewable energy
projects and their most recent regulatory actions (DR Executed, ROD
Executed, Lease issued, etc.). Pursuant to Section 50265 of the
Inflation Reduction Act, at what stage of the regulatory process does
BLM consider a solar-right-of way to be issued?

73c) The Committee is concerned that the BLM's approval of the
Ancient Trails Solar Project may have failed to meet the requirements
from Section 50625. Please provide sufficient evidence as to why you
believe the issuance of that right-of-way met the criteria from Section
50625.

Question 74. How does BLM have authority to manage or regulate
lands in the NPR-A under FLPMA? Can BLM identify where in the law the
agency is authorized to manage NPR-A under FLPMA?

Question 75. Regarding the NPR-A:

75a) Do you think the new NPR-A rule will have any negative effect
on future leasing in the NPR-A?

75b) The new NPR-A rule adds new processes and decisions that BLM
must undertake and make when permitting activity in the NPR-A. Did BLM
perform any analysis of the added time and cost for permitting
activities in the NPR-A as a consequence of the new rule? If so, please
provide.

75c) If an existing leaseholder proposes a new development in a
Special Area, does the new rule's presumption against new
infrastructure in Special Areas apply?

Question 76. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 designated permit
processing Pilot Offices in seven BLM Field Offices. These ``pilot
offices'' were redesignated as ``Project Offices'' by Section 3021 of
the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. How many staff are in each
of these ``Project Offices''?

Question 77. Section 365 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005
permanently directs that 50 percent of rents from onshore mineral
leases for oil and gas, coal, and oil shale on Federal lands are to be
deposited into the Permit Processing Improvement Fund (PPIF).
Additionally, section 3021 of the National Defense Authorization Act of
2015 permanently extended the BLM's access to the rent receipts in the
PPIF and section 3021 added fees for APDs as a source of receipts to
the PPIF. Specifically, Section 3021 authorizes the Secretary in fiscal
years 2016 through 2026 to charge and collect a $9,500 APD processing
fee, indexed for inflation. According to the FY 2025 Bureau of Land
Management Greenbook, in 2023, the BLM deposited $51.8 million into the
Permit Processing Improvement Fund (PPIF), including both rental
receipts and APD fees. How much money has the BLM allocated for permit
processing for oil and gas outside of fee collection by year over the
last 20 years?

Question 78. The BLM's budget proposes a $63,000 decrease in Public
Domain Forest Management.

78a) Why is the BLM cutting funding for forest management?

78b) Is this funding decrease consistent with DOI's 5-year strategy
to reduce wildfire risk?

Question 79. The budget states: ``The decrease in funding will
result in slightly fewer acres treated to restore forest structure and
composition for fire and climate resilience compared to 2023 levels.''
Please provide the exact acreage the agency treated in 2023 and the
expected acreage decrease for 2024.

Question 80. What percentage of the agency's reforestation targets
are accomplished annually?

Question 81. How large is the BLM's reforestation backlog?

Question 82. Is the BLM meeting the targets set forth in the 5-year
strategy to reduce wildfire?

Question 83. The budget states: ``The BLM is shifting program
emphasis in response to E.O. 14072, Strengthening the Nation's Forests,
Communities, and Local Economies. In keeping with the E.O., BLM will
reduce timber outputs to a total volume offered of 215 million board
feet to focus on protection of mature and old-growth forests and
improving forest health and fire resilience.''

83a) Does the BLM view active forest management as a threat to
``old-growth'' or ``mature'' forests?

83b) How is the BLM defining ``mature and old-growth'' forests?

83c) What is the biggest threat to forests in Western Oregon?

83d) How many acres of land have been lost to catastrophic wildfire
in Western Oregon in the past 10 years?

83e) How many acres in Western Oregon are already under a
restrictive land designation, such as a wilderness or national
monument?

83f) Of the acreage identified in 83(e), how much has burned in the
past 10 years? How does this compare with acreage not under some type
of restrictive land designation?

Questions Submitted by Representative Lamborn

Question 1. The BLM's Landscape and Conservation Health Rule allows
for mitigation and restoration leases which have no acreage limits. How
will the BLM determine an adequate price per acre for these leases?

Question 2. What mechanism is in place to ensure that radical
environmentalist 501c3s do not use massive donation-based funding to
lock up tens or hundreds of thousands of acres of land?

Question 3. Will the BLM require these leases to pay royalties like
oil and gas do?

Question 4. Will these leases require any right of way or bonding
requirements?

Question 5. The BLM's Fluid Mineral and Leasing rule establishes a
preference criterion for leases.

Question 6. Where do mitigation and restoration leases rank in this
criterion?

Question 7. BLM has stated that restoration and mitigation leases
are only necessary until the land has been restored to a usable
condition.

Question 8. What is the measurement criteria that defines when the
land has been returned to a usable condition?

Question 9. Years worth of the worst wildfires our country has ever
seen have proven that hands-off preservation is not a viable land
management method.

Question 10. Do you believe that restoration and mitigation lease
holders should be required to put up a bond for wildfires that occur on
their lease as a result of mismanagement or no management?

Question 11. As you know, oil and gas lease sale revenue is split
roughly 50/50 between states and the federal government. The money
provided to states is used for education, public safety, and other
essential services. In the first 3 years of the Trump administration
the Department held 11 oil and gas lease sales, leasing 221,000 acres,
bringing in $8.8 million in revenue to the state and federal
government. In the first 3 years under your control, the Department has
held 1 lease sale in Colorado, leasing one 290 acre parcel, bringing in
$1.2 million in revenue to the State and federal government.

Question 12. How are western states and communities supposed to
provide essential services to their constituents when you are locking
up their lands and failing to hold regular lease sales?

Question 13. It looks like the BLM has one upcoming lease sale in
Colorado for a paltry 120 acres. This lease sale along with the only
other lease sale held by this administration neglects the Western
Slope.

Question 14. Will you commit to holding a lease sale on the Western
Slope this year?

Questions Submitted by Representative Fulcher

Question 1. Just recently, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
forecasted a very high risk for wildfires in the West this year. This
is due to low precipitation combined with high fuel mix creating
significant challenges for rural communities and the electric utilities
that serve them. In response to this threat, electric cooperatives in
my district are doing everything within their power to mitigate
wildfire risks. However, the unpredictable nature of extreme weather
conditions complicates long-term planning efforts. It's important to
note that these utilities operate on a non-profit basis, meaning any
additional expenses incurred ultimately burdens their customers.
Unfortunately, I've learned that the Bureau of Land Management is
considering imposing substantial charges on these utilities for using
power line corridors across BLM lands, nearly totaling $3 million per
fire incident in strict liability damages. This approach presents a
severe financial strain for smaller, rural electric cooperatives and
the communities they serve. Already these utilities are finding it
difficult to obtain wildfire insurance and such levels of damage could
bankrupt them. Given the gravity of this situation, I question BLM's
authority to unilaterally raise strict liability damages for powerline
coordinators, especially considering the significant risk it imposes on
utilities.

1a) Is it BLM's intention to pursue this course of action, and if
so, would the agency be willing to engage with my office or the
committee to collaborate with utilities on addressing this issue?

1b) Under what authority can BLM charge strict liability damages
and how does the agency justify this one-size-fits-all level of
damages?

Question 2. Director Stone-Manning, there is a project in
Southeastern Idaho under review now by the Bureau of Land Management
(BLM) that is of great importance to American agriculture. The project
is known as the ``Caldwell Canyon Mine'' and the proponent is P4
Production, L.L.C.

When complete, Caldwell Canyon Mine will provide the only source of
elemental phosphorus in the United States (and indeed only source in
the western hemisphere), which is critically important to our Nation's
and the world's food supply, along with other important applications.
It is important to note that P4's current mine, Blackfoot Bridge, is
nearing the end of its economic life so there is a need to ensure that
the permitting review of the Caldwell Canyon project is completed in a
timely fashion.

In addition to its importance to American agriculture, the Caldwell
Canyon project is critically important to the Idaho economy. Mining
operations at the Blackfoot Bridge mine and the processing plant in
Soda Springs, Idaho support over 1,200 direct jobs, and approximately
2,000 indirect jobs in the southeastern Idaho region. Once operational,
the Caldwell Canyon Mine will provide an estimated $115 million in
direct economic benefits annually in Idaho and about $230 million
annually in indirect economic benefits. Anticipating over 40 years of
production at Caldwell, P4 would also pay an estimated $80 to $120
million to the state and federal governments in royalties for the
project.

The BLM has been diligently working on this project for many years.
I appreciate its focus and dedication in the face of surprising and
disappointing court decisions by the federal district court in Idaho
last year--over three and a half years after the BLM's initial
approvals to proceed--vacating all of the BLM's work and remanding the
project back to the agency. Of note, the vacatur came after significant
investment and project development activity.

As I understand it, part of the problem was that the applicable
ARMPA standards changed in the midst of the NEPA review and before the
Record of Decision was issued, causing confusion and delay and as noted
by the federal court. I am concerned that with the timing of your new
Greater Sage Grouse plan amendments and the ongoing Caldwell Canyon
Mine Environmental Impact Statement, that the same thing could happen
again with changing standards at the last minute after years of review
disrupting and delaying the permitting process.

I am also concerned with the impact of the newly released
Conservation and Landscape Health Rule, which I strongly oppose, and
want to ensure it does not significantly disrupt and delay the Caldwell
Canyon permitting process.

2a) Will you ensure that a decision for the Caldwell Canyon Mine
stays on track with a timely ROD in 2025?

2b) Will you ensure that any decision to approve the Caldwell
Canyon Mine is not disrupted again by the Greater Sage Grouse plan
amendment process? This could be done by including election language
for Caldwell Canyon in the EIS for the 2024 ARMPA which allows the BLM
the option to apply either the best combination of old and new ARMPA
standards that keep the project on schedule and ensure its durability.

2c) Will you ensure that any decision to approve the Caldwell
Canyon Mine is not disrupted by the BLM's Conservation and Landscape
Health rulemaking?

Questions Submitted by Representative Grijalva

Question 1. At the start of this year, the Department's final rule
for the Implementation of the Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act went into effect. Within this budget request, there is
$250,000 for NAGPRA in the Cultural Resources Management Program, could
you share how this funding will be utilized to ensure compliance and
implementation of the new rule?

Question 2. There are two provisions under the John D. Dingell, Jr.
Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act that expressly require the
Department of the Interior to consult with Indian Tribes demonstrating
ancestral, cultural, or other ties to the resources within the
Management Area, to develop a cultural resources survey for the Vinagre
Wash Special Management Area and a cultural resources management plan
for the Xam Kwatchan Trail network, both of which are within lands
managed by BLM.\1\ DOI delegated these responsibilities to BLM through
Secretarial Order 3374. These requirements were statutorily required to
be completed by March 2021. Could you provide an update on the status
of these provisions and how BLM will use congressional appropriations
to fulfill these statutory obligations?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ 16 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 410eeee(f)(8); 410aaa-75(d).

Question 3. BLM's budget requests significant investments to
support President Biden's agenda, including thoughtful stewardship of
public lands and water and implementation of the recommendations of the
Interagency Working Group on Mining Laws, Regulations, and Permitting.
The Interagency Working Group report recognizes the challenges Tribes
face to protect lands beyond their reservation and trust land
boundaries from harmful mining activities and emphasizes the importance
of regular, meaningful, and robust tribal consultation to appropriately
assess the impacts of mining on tribal communities. While I support the
administration's efforts to implement the recommendations, I often hear
from Tribes that BLM has not engaged in meaningful tribal consultation
for lands containing important tangible and intangible cultural
resources, consequently leading to lands significant to tribal
communities having been mismanaged and severely damaged by mining and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
other commercial activities.

3a) Could you briefly explain how BLM will ensure regular,
meaningful, and robust tribal consultation in implementing the
recommendations of the Interagency Working Group and prior to project
approvals that could adversely impact culturally significant areas and
resources?

3b) How is BLM utilizing funding and resources to train staff and
improve implementation and enforcement of its tribal consultation
policies and procedures?

3c) What efforts is BLM engaging in to resolve dispute between
Tribes and the agency, has there been consideration of engaging
independent, third-party mediators to assist with resolving disputes?

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you for your testimony, Director Stone-
Manning. I would now like to recognize Representative Bentz to
introduce our next witness.
Mr. Bentz. Thank you, Mr. Chair. It is my privilege to
introduce my friend, Director Chuck Sams, today.
Director Sams is an enrolled member of the Confederated
Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation of Northeast Oregon,
and is a constituent of mine in Congressional District 2. He
served as Executive Director for the Confederated Tribes of the
Umatilla Indian Reservation. He is a U.S. Navy veteran, where
he served as an intelligence specialist. He holds a bachelor of
science in business administration from Concordia University,
and a master of legal studies in Indigenous peoples law from
the University of Oklahoma School of Law.
Prior to his appointment to Director of the National Park
Service, he served as Oregon Governor Kate Brown's appointee to
the Pacific Northwest Power and Conservation Council. I was
proud to support his confirmation as Director of the National
Park Service.
Welcome, Director Sams.
I yield back.

Mr. Tiffany. Mr. Sams, you have 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. CHUCK SAMS, III, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL PARK
SERVICE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, WASHINGTON, DC,
ACCOMPANIED BY JESSICA BOWRON, COMPTROLLER, NATIONAL PARK
SERVICE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, WASHINGTON, DC

Mr. Sams. [Speaking Native language.] Thank you, Chair
Westerman, for meeting with me earlier.
Thank you, Chair Tiffany and Ranking Member Neguse, for
having me here today.
Thank you, Congressman Bentz. It is always nice to see
somebody from home, especially eastern Oregon.
I also want to thank the members of the Subcommittee for
the opportunity to appear before you on the Fiscal Year 2025
budget request for the National Park Service. I would like to
summarize my testimony and submit my entire statement for the
record.
The discretionary budget request for the National Park
Service is $3.6 billion, an increase of $251.3 million compared
to Fiscal Year 2024 enacted funding. I want to highlight for
you a few critical components.
The Fiscal Year 2025 budget proposes $15.1 million in
increased investments to advance racial justice and equity for
underserved communities, including the strengthening of Nation-
to-Nation relationships with tribes. This includes an
additional $3 million for expanded tribal co-stewardship of
park resources, $1.5 million to increase tourism that benefits
tribes, $2.5 million in dedicated funding for tribal heritage
grants, and $1 million for management of subsistence uses of
National Park Service lands and waters in Alaska.
The initiative also invests in new parks that expand access
and tell important stories, like the Emmett Till and Mamie
Till-Mobley National Monument, the Somerton site expansion of
Brown versus Board of Education National Historic Park, and the
Amache National Historic Site. Through these efforts we intend
to create greater opportunities for underserved communities to
enjoy and engage in their national parks.
The Fiscal Year 2025 request also invests $180 million in
support of operational needs. The National Park Service has
lost almost 15 percent of its operational capacity since Fiscal
Year 2010. Over the same period, over 35 units have been added
to the National Park System, and annual visitation has
increased by tens of millions. This new funding includes $46
million in support of the proposed 2025 employee pay raise, as
well as the $105.8 million in baseline capacity due to the
absorption of the 2024 pay increases that eroded parks'
purchasing power. And to help meet this growth in operational
demand, the budget seeks $11.2 million to address new and
critical responsibilities across parks and offices, such as
addressing significant physical security issues at Mount
Rushmore National Memorial, and providing increased resource
and visitor protection at Stonewall National Monument.
The Fiscal Year 2025 budget also proposes $6.8 million in
wage-grade and locality adjustments to support required
increases in personnel expenses, and $10 million to restore
staff capacity lost in Fiscal Year 2024.
Also, to help prevent the growth of deferred maintenance,
the request proposes $193.2 million for cyclic maintenance, a
$5 million increase over Fiscal Year 2024. This funding
supports projects that address routine maintenance and
recapitalization needs, and contributes to the National Park
Service's approach towards life cycle investments that sustain
assets in the long term.
Lastly, the budget proposes to invest more than $100
million across fund sources for housing needs. The National
Park Service has more than 5,600 housing units across 213 parks
that house more than 15,000 people. While many of these units
are in good condition, many have deferred maintenance and
modernization needs, and the market for housing in gateway
communities around parks is rapidly changing. There has been an
increase in both the cost of housing, as well as the use for
vacation rentals, leading to a lack of affordable and available
housing for park employees in these communities. In areas that
have seen significant increases in housing costs, housing is a
common factor cited in job offer declinations. And some staff
have been lost due to the housing challenge.
We take the responsibility of providing sufficient housing
to our employees seriously. Therefore, the budget also includes
an increase of $9 million to construct, improve, and modernize
housing for National Park Service employees. This funding
increase will support compliance, design, and construction of
housing units that will replace obsolete and deteriorating
housing or add housing capacity at multiple parks, including at
Rocky Mountain National Park, Sequoia and Kings Canyon Park,
and Mammoth Cave National Park.
Finally, I am pleased to update you on our progress to
implement the Great American Outdoors Act. Funding from the
Legacy Restoration Fund has provided us almost $3.9 billion for
deferred maintenance. We have obligated more than $2.1 billion,
with over 131 projects underway, and more starting this year.
From the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the National Park
Service has received more than $395 million for land
acquisition activities and over $1 billion for state grant
programs matched by non-Federal funds, for a total impact of at
least $2 billion.
Chairman, this concludes my summary. Thank you for the
opportunity to testify today, and for your continued support of
the National Park Service. I would be happy to answer any
questions.

[The prepared statement of Mr. Sams follows:]
Prepared Statement of Charles F. Sams III, Director, National Park
Service, U.S. Department of the Interior

Chair Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today
at this oversight hearing on the Fiscal Year 2025 President's Budget
Request for the National Park Service (NPS).
I am pleased to share with you the President's Budget Request for
the NPS, which directly supports the vision and objectives laid out by
President Biden and Secretary Haaland for the Department of the
Interior (DOI), as well as my own priorities for the NPS. If enacted,
this budget will help enable us to support and protect our resources,
our visitors, and our employees well into the future.

FY 2025 Budget Summary

The FY 2025 discretionary budget request for the NPS is $3.6
billion, an increase of $251.3 million compared to FY 2024 enacted
funding levels, supporting an estimated 14,571 full-time equivalents
(FTE). Recreation fee revenue, funding from the Land and Water
Conservation Fund and other mandatory funding sources provide
additional funding of $1.24 billion. The total FY 2025 request from all
fund sources for NPS is $4.81 billion and 19,912 FTE.
The request prioritizes conserving our natural and cultural
resources, advancing racial equity and support for underserved
communities. The request balances investments in key priorities with
necessary funding for day-to-day operation of the 429 park units, 25
trails, and 66 wild and scenic rivers, ensuring the American public
continues to have enriching experiences on park lands.
The request also invests in our most valuable resource--NPS
employees. My top priority as Director continues to be to connect and
empower a thriving and diverse workforce, and I believe that funding
initiatives such as providing quality employee housing and increasing
parks' capacity to address growing responsibilities directly support
this goal. To that end, the budget supports an increase of $151.9
million across all accounts for FY 2025 fixed costs like the 2.0
percent employee pay increase, and maintaining baseline capacity to
reflect increased FY 2024 fixed cost requirements. Without full funding
for these costs, the NPS will continue to absorb these must-pay costs
by cutting funding for program work or staffing.

Operation of the National Park System--The FY 2025 budget request
for the NPS operations account is $3.1 billion, an increase of $201.9
million above the FY 2024 enacted level, including an increase of $44.0
million for FY 2025 fixed costs. This includes $431.0 million for
Resource Stewardship, $299.5 million for Visitor Services, $456.6
million for Park Protection, $974.0 million for Facility Operations and
Maintenance, $709.7 million for Park Support, and $219.5 million for
External Administrative Costs.
Additionally, in support of our NPS employees and staffing
capacity, the operations budget provides an additional $28.0 million
for increasing general staffing capacity, supporting new and critical
responsibilities at park sites, and increases to wage grade and
locality pay areas. This funding will increase operating capacity at
parks and offices with new and critical needs, allow NPS to collaborate
with the public and Tribal governments, broaden programming and
maintenance activities, expand our law enforcement presence, and
improve park safety and security.
Also, to help prevent the growth of deferred maintenance, the
account proposes $193.2 million for cyclic maintenance, a $5.0 million
increase over FY 2024. This funding supports projects that address
routine maintenance and recapitalization needs, and contributes to the
NPS' approach toward lifecycle investments that sustain assets in the
long-term.

Centennial Challenge--This appropriation, requested at $13.0
million, leverages partner donations for signature projects and
programs at national parks. The Centennial Challenge program is
instrumental in garnering and fostering strong partnerships. All
Federal funds must be matched on at least a 1 to 1 basis, creating a
program total of at least $26.0 million. These projects focus on
repairing and modernizing NPS infrastructure, expanding recreational
opportunities and access to the public, and developing new and improved
educational and interpretive programs for visitors.

National Recreation and Preservation--The FY 2025 budget request
for the National Recreation and Preservation (NR&P) appropriation is
$84.4 million. This appropriation is dedicated to supporting local
community efforts to preserve natural and cultural resources from the
local level to the international. Natural resource programs funded in
this account support collaborative and community-driven efforts and
outcome-focused investments to preserve and enhance rural landscapes,
urban parks and rivers, important ecosystems, and wildlife habitat. NPS
cultural programs funded in this account support public participation
in preserving the Nation's cultural heritage through National Register
Programs, research and training in historic preservation and
conservation, and a number of grant programs. The FY 2025 request
includes an increase of $3.0 million to fund the recently established
African American Burial Grounds Preservation Grant Program and invests
additional funding in staffing for grants administration to ensure
proper management of a growing workload of grants funded through this
appropriation and the Historic Preservation Fund.
The request also maintains funding for NR&P programs such as
Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance, National Register
programs, Chesapeake Gateways and Trails, Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation, Japanese American Confinement Sites,
American Battlefield Protection Program Assistance, American Indian and
Native Hawaiian Art and Culture, and the 9/11 Memorial Act. NR&P also
supports the management of the Heritage Partnership Program, which
distributes Federal funding to 60 National Heritage Areas in 36 States
and one territory as well as international cooperation on park and
heritage resource management. While NPS recognized the important role
of National Heritage Areas as important local conservation leaders, the
FY 2025 request finds savings of $11.2 million to the Heritage
Partnership Program along with other budget savings to preserve funding
for core operations and Administration priorities.

Historic Preservation Fund--The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF)
supports Historic Preservation Offices in States, territories, and
Tribal lands to preserve historically and culturally significant sites
and provides competitive grants to other entities. The FY 2025 budget
request for this appropriation is $151.4 million. As part of the
budget's advancement of racial justice and equity for underserved
communities, the request includes $2.5 million in new, dedicated
funding for Tribal Heritage Grants to support Federally recognized
Tribes, Alaska Native Villages and Corporations, and Native Hawaiian
Organizations to preserve and protect their cultural heritage.
The President's budget includes $62.2 million for grants to State
Historic Preservation Offices and $23.0 million to Tribal Historic
Preservation Offices to help meet preservation responsibilities under
the National Historic Preservation Act to protect and preserve historic
resources, based on local needs and priorities. This appropriation also
includes $11.0 million for grants-in-aid to Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (HBCUs) to support preservation of historic structures
on HBCU campuses, $12.5 million for Paul Bruhn Historic Revitalization
Grants to support subgrant programs for historic preservation projects
that stimulate economic growth in rural areas, $30.3 million for
competitive grants to preserve historic sites that tell the stories of
the struggles for civil rights and equal rights in America, and $10.0
million for Save America's Treasures grants to support preservation of
nationally significant sites and collections.

Construction--The FY 2025 budget request includes $237.2 million to
fund construction projects, equipment replacement, management,
planning, operations, and special projects. This includes $124.7
million for line-item construction, which includes an increase of $46.1
million for major construction projects, in order to modernize and
renew some NPS priority assets. This account also includes a $9.0
million increase to improve and expand NPS housing, a $3.9 million
increase for Climate Vulnerability Studies, a $3.2 million increase for
construction project planning, and a $1.0 million increase to help
establish charging infrastructure that supports the Federal Zero
Emission Vehicle fleet.

FY 2025 Budget Priorities

Advancing Racial Justice and Equity for Underserved Communities--
The Biden-Harris Administration directs Federal agencies to operate in
an environment that advances equity for all, including people of color
and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and
adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality. Consistent
with that effort, the NPS emphasizes a focus on advancing equity,
inclusion, and access as we carry out the NPS mission.
The FY 2025 NPS budget includes an increase of $15.1 million in
targeted investments to support advancement of racial justice and
equity for underserved communities. This increase is spread across
multiple appropriations. The request proposes $3.1 million and 22 FTE
in the Biden-Harris Administration's Increasing Representation on Our
Public Lands initiative, which supports operations at new or expanded
park sites like Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Historic
Site, Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park's Summerton
South Carolina unit, New Philadelphia National Historic Site, Blackwell
School National Historic Site, and Amache National Historic Site. This
effort also includes $3.0 million to implement the recently established
African American Burial Grounds Preservation Program, $250,000 for the
newly established Japanese American World War II History Network, and
$500,000 to address the growing workload of grants management.
The NPS's commitment to respect and strengthen connections with
Indigenous communities, enhance our nation-to-nation relationships, and
fully uphold our trust and treaty responsibilities--another top
priority for the Service--is reflected in our request for an additional
$3.0 million to support expanded Tribal co-stewardship of park
resources, $1.5 million to implement the Native American Tourism
Improving Visitor Experience Act (NATIVE Act) to support tourism that
benefits Tribes, $1.0 million to support the management of subsistence
uses of NPS lands in Alaska, $250,000 for a new Native American Graves
Protection Act (NAGPRA) national program coordinator, and $2.5 million
to provide dedicated funding for competitive grants to Tribes, Alaska
Native Villages and Corporations, and Native Hawaiian Organizations for
the preservation and protection of their cultural heritage.

Ensuring Operational Capacity in the National Park System--The NPS
has lost almost 15 percent of its operations staff capacity since FY
2010. Over the same period, over 35 new units and additional authorized
sites have been added to the system, existing units have seen
responsibilities grow, and visitation has increased by tens of
millions. To meet this demonstrated and anticipated additional demand,
the FY 2025 budget proposes $180.0 million and 944 FTE spread across
multiple appropriations in support of several priorities. These
increases provide vital support to parks and programs to advance
priorities and fulfil important responsibilities.
The budget requests $151.9 million to support basic operational
capacity needs associated with increases in fixed costs. $46.1 million
of this request will support the proposed 2025 fixed costs increase
including the employee pay raise, while $105.8 million will support
baseline capacity due to absorption of FY 2024 fixed cost requirements.
An additional $11.2 million and 69 FTE will support new and critical
responsibilities at park units and central offices, such as addressing
significant physical security issues at Mount Rushmore National
Memorial and providing increased resource and visitor protection at
Stonewall National Monument. The FY 2025 budget proposes $6.8 million
in Wage Grade and Locality Adjustments to support required increases in
personnel expenses and $10.0 million for staff capacity restoration.

Employee Housing--To address this very critical need, the FY 2025
budget proposal invests more than $100 million in housing for NPS
employees across multiple fund sources, including a $9.0 million
proposed increase in the Construction account that would directly
support new construction or rehabilitation of existing housing
facilities. Housing for employees in and near national parks is
increasingly scarce and expensive, reflecting a trend impacting
communities across the country; this has led to long commutes and has
made it difficult for NPS to recruit and retain employees. This funding
increase will support compliance, design, and construction of housing
units that will replace obsolete and deteriorated housing or add
housing capacity at multiple parks, including at Rocky Mountain
National Park, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, and Mammoth
Cave National Park.

Additional Priorities--The 2025 President's Budget contains
additional increases that support key NPS priorities. To mitigate the
impacts of climate change, this includes an increase of $2.5 million to
invest in conservation and climate-based projects that will include
management and control of non-native invasive species, restoration of
damaged ecosystems, or mitigation of threats to at-risk resources. And,
to further strengthen the Department's ability to meet its conservation
mission in the face of a changing climate, the NPS budget includes
$250,000 as part of a total $1.0 million increase Department-wide to
establish experts in NPS and other DOI bureaus to implement a nature-
based solutions policy. To assess the impacts of a changing climate on
parks, the budget requests an additional $3.9 million to conduct
climate vulnerability studies. The budget also includes $4.0 million
for Zero Emission Vehicle equipment and infrastructure deployment,
which is used to increase electrical supply and access for electric
vehicle supply equipment, and coordinates installation to ensure the
Department can maximize the use of these charging stations.
The NPS request also includes a $15.4 million investment in Central
Information Technology (IT) needs. This funding will invest in IT
modernization, the IT workforce, and critical IT infrastructure needs
in order to meet growing cybersecurity requirements. Additional funding
will preclude these costs from being billed to park and program
budgets, which would further erode their operational capacity.
Additionally, the request includes $1.0 million in new funding to
implement recommendations of the DOI Law Enforcement Task Force to
proactively support the mental health, wellness, and resiliency of all
DOI law enforcement officers from recruitment to retirement. This
funding would also provide additional psychological testing, required
for all newly hired law enforcement officers. The request also contains
a one-time investment of $4.2 million for activities associated with
the 2025 Presidential Inauguration.

Conclusion

The President's FY 2025 budget proposal supports President Biden's
commitment to respecting and strengthening our connections with
underserved communities, mitigating the impacts of climate change, and
restoring parks' abilities to protect our shared cultural and natural
heritage.
Chairman Tiffany, thank you for the opportunity to testify before
you today and for the Subcommittee's continued support of the NPS. I
would be pleased to answer any questions you or other members of the
Subcommittee may have.

Questions Submitted for the Record to the Honorable Chuck Sams,
Director, National Park Service

The Honorable Chuck Sams did not submit responses to the Committee by
the appropriate deadline for inclusion in the printed record.

Questions Submitted by Representative Westerman

Question 1. It is our understanding that the National Park Service
(NPS), to date, has spent less than 3 percent of the funds it received
from the so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was
specifically earmarked for hiring new employees. I've been told that
NPS has spent less than $13 million so far. Yet, I continue to hear
time and again from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and
from NPS itself, that NPS needs more money for hiring.

1a) How do you reconcile these conflicting facts?

1b) Please provide a full accounting of the money spent from the
IRA on hiring new employees.

1c) Of the funds that were spent, what positions were filled across
the agency?

Question 2. Does the NPS have the authority to change the
regulations for concessioners to update thresholds on audits and fees
to reflect inflation? Right now, concessioners must pay for audits if
their income is above $500,000. This hasn't been adjusted in decades,
meaning more and more small concessioners are subject to this
regulation due to inflation, not actual growth. Have you considered how
inflation is impacting the concessioners' fees and auditing
requirements? Please explain.

Question 3. Your submitted testimony states: ``An additional $11.2
million and 69 [full-time equivalents (FTE)] will support new and
critical responsibilities at park units and central offices, such as
addressing significant physical security issues at Mount Rushmore
National Memorial . . .''

3a) Will you describe what ``significant physical security issues''
there are at Mount Rushmore?

3b) Please describe why the current level of security, law
enforcement agents, and infrastructure (including fences, cameras,
etc.) are not adequate to address the ``significant physical security
issues.''

3c) How much of the $11.2 million and 69 FTE are requested
specifically for Mount Rushmore National Memorial?

Question 4. The lease for the migrant encampment at Floyd Bennett
Field ends on September 14, 2024.

4a) Will you commit to promptly informing the Committee once a
decision is made on the renewal of the lease?

4b) Will you commit to ensuring that no other units of the National
Park System are used as locations for migrant encampments?

Question 5. What were the staffing levels at Gateway National
Recreation Area in New York City on September 1, 2023?

Question 6. What were the staffing levels at Gateway National
Recreation Area in New York City on May 15, 2024?

Question 7. Included in the priority project request under Great
American Outdoor Act for the NPS was $40 million in repairs for the
Gateway National Recreation Area, which includes Floyd Bennett Field.

7a) Will housing 2,000 migrants at Floyd Bennett Field impact the
timeline of completing this work?

7b) Will any of the $40 million be used to repair damages to the
recreation area caused by housing migrants?

7c) Will any of these funds be used to construct or improve housing
for illegal migrants?

Question 8. Have you been to Floyd Bennet Field and seen the
migrant camps established under the lease from the NPS and the city of
New York?

Question 9. In response to questioning about reported criminal
activity at Floyd Bennett Field, including arrests for assault and
domestic violence, you stated that the information you have received
from U.S. Park Police ``is mostly around unregistered cars that we're
seeing and some minor, petty stuff.'' Is the NPS unaware of the
numerous violent crimes that have been reported at Floyd Bennett Field
since it was turned into a migrant housing facility?

Question 10. Please provide reports of all instances in which U.S.
Park Police responded to reported crimes at Floyd Bennett Field since
November 2023.

Question 11. The NPS stated in its FY 2025 budget justification
that units along the U.S.-Mexico border ``consistently experience
serious resource damage due to illegal cross-border activities
traversing the parks.''

11a) Have you spoken with Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas on
ways to secure federal border lands?

11b) If not, will you commit to doing so, and by when?

11c) Have you met with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
agents about how to improve operational control of federal borderlands
and protect the life and safety of officers?

Question 12. Chairman Tiffany asked you ``how much is the National
Park Service proposing for the Southwest Border Resource Protection
Program?'' In response, you asked for the assistance of an aide and
then responded, ``approximately $1 million.'' In fact, the total
request is $693,000, so your answer inflated the true value by more
than 44 percent. Does NPS believe that it should be spending at least
$370,000 more on this program?

Question 13. CBS News reported that the remains of two suspected
border crossers who likely died from heat exposure were found in the
Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in July 2023. How many migrants and
suspected migrants have died on NPS lands along the U.S.-Mexico border
since 2021? Please provide annual totals.

Question 14. Please provide all data that the NPS collected for FY
2021, 2022, and 2023 on trash that is illegally discarded on NPS-
administered lands along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Question 15. Does the NPS conduct any trash-collection activities
on NPS-administered lands along the U.S.-Mexico border? Please describe
such activities in detail, including the number conducted each year
from FY 2021 to FY 2023.

Question 16. How much funding has the NPS spent to initiate,
administer, and grow the 30x30 initiative?

Question 17. By the end of FY 2023, the NPS had a $23.3 billion
deferred maintenance backlog on its existing lands. Yet
conservation.gov asserts that the U.S. will need to bring about ``rapid
accelerations'' in conservation efforts to meet the goals of the Biden
administration's 30x30 initiative.

17a) Is it wise for the NPS to engage in expanded preservation
efforts, when it currently has a large deferred maintenance backlog?

17b) Should the NPS refrain from acquiring more conservation
acreage until the backlog is eliminated or substantially reduced? If
not, please explain why not.

Question 18. In numerous places throughout the budget, NPS
justifies cutting various programs to ``preserve funding for
Administration priorities.'' In each place this appears, please provide
a justification for why this program is being cut and what
``Administration priority it is funding instead:

18a) National Capital Performing Arts Program

18b) Quagga and Zebra Mussels Management Projects

18c) Repair and Rehabilitation Projects

18d) GPS Modernization

18e) Centennial Challenge

18f) Heritage Partnership Programs Commissions and Grants

18g) Semiquincentennial Preservation Grants

18h) Save America's Treasures Grants

18i) Abandoned Mineral Lands

Question 19. Do repair and rehabilitation projects prevent
infrastructure from eventually being added to the deferred maintenance
backlog?

Question 20. How will reducing $25 million in funding for repair
and rehabilitation projects eventually affect the deferred maintenance
backlog?

Question 21. The budget states that a $2 million cut to the
Centennial Challenge Fund will result in eight fewer projects. Please
list which projects would not receive funding.

Question 22. The budget states that there will be an $11 million
reduction in the Heritage Partnership Programs Commission and Grants
account and yet each organization that previously received funding will
continue to do so. Please provide a breakdown of the funding reduction
anticipated for each individual Heritage Area.

Question 23. How much money is NPS planning to allocate in FY 2025
to Giant Sequoia restoration and resiliency projects?

Questions Submitted by Representative Stauber

Question 1. On November 6, 2023, leadership from the Voyageurs
National Park (``Voyageurs'') sent a note to all Commercial Use
Authorization (CUA) holders outlining policy changes the National Park
Service (NPS) were making relating to the CUA application process
beginning for the 2024 season, with additional changes planned for the
2025 season. These CUA application changes included increasing fees,
removing the ability of vendors to bundle applications and associated
fees for multiple activities, as well as moving from a rolling
application process to a defined three-month application window. As a
result of these changes and increased fees, many CUA applicants will be
required to pay anywhere from several hundred to several thousands of
dollars in additional application fees. Additionally, should a CUA
applicant fail to submit their application during the defined
application window or have their application denied, they will be
unable to provide recreational activities to the public until the
following season.

1a) How are these changes consistent with the NPS's stated mission
to preserve the national and cultural resources and values of the
National Park System, to ``cooperate with partners to extend the
benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor
recreation throughout this country and the world?'' \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/index.htm

1b) Has the NPS evaluated the impact that these policy changes will
have on the public's visitation and accessibility by the public to
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Voyageurs and other properties within the National Park System?

1c) If the number of approved CUA holders, or the number of
activities offered by approved CUA holders, decreases as a result of
these policy changes, what actions will the NPS take to ensure the
public continues to have the same level of access and recreational
opportunities at Voyageurs and other properties within the National
Park System?

Question 2. As part of the November 6, 2023 communication from the
Voyageurs leadership, CUA applicants were notified that they would be
required to complete the ``2023 Annual Report'' form along with their
completed 2024 CUA application. The ``2023 Annual Report'' requires the
disclosure of several pieces of sensitive financial information,
including relating to receipts and income from CUA holders business
operations.

2a) What is the NPS justification for the collection of this
sensitive financial information?

2b) How is this information utilized by the NPS, including but not
limited to the evaluation of a CUA holder's application?

2c) Is this information shared beyond the NPS? Is this information
kept confidential?

2d) What safeguards are in place to ensure this information is kept
secure by the NPS?

this issue?

Questions Submitted by Representative Grijalva

Question 1. At the start of this year, the Department's final rule
for the Implementation of the Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act went into effect. Within this budget request, there is
$250,000 for NAGPRA in the Cultural Resource Stewardship Program, could
you share how this funding will be utilized to ensure compliance and
implementation of the new rule?

______

Mr. Tiffany. Thank you very much, Director Sams. We will
now move on to questioning at this point, and I am going to
begin the questioning here of our witnesses.
Director Sams, your agency manages 195 miles of land along
the southern border. Have you visited the southern border in
your capacity as Director?
Mr. Sams. Yes, sir. Most recently, last year, I went and
visited Saguaro National Park, and was able to talk about
border issues both with the Tohono O'odham Tribe and with my
staff.
Mr. Tiffany. And have you seen the impact of the garbage
that is being dropped at the southern border by illegal
immigrants?
Mr. Sams. I am very concerned about that same thing, sir,
and I thank you for the question.
Yes, we are very aware of the amount of impact we are
seeing on the southern border with the amount of trash. We work
continuously to ensure the safe environment for our visitors
down there and for staff alike in working to resolve those
issues.
Mr. Tiffany. Director Stone-Manning, your agency manages
173 miles of land on the southern border. Have you visited the
southern border as a director?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, I have.
Mr. Tiffany. You have visited? And have you seen the
environmental devastation that is going on on the southern
border like I have?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, I didn't see a lot of
trash. I did see some clean-up work necessary from the previous
administration's construction projects.
Mr. Tiffany. Oh, I see, it was the previous
administration's fault that there are 193 tons of garbage that
had been dropped on the Federal lands. Is that what you are
saying?
Ms. Stone-Manning. No, Congressman, I am saying I didn't
witness that trash.
Mr. Tiffany. You didn't witness that trash?
Ms. Stone-Manning. I didn't.
Mr. Tiffany. I have seen it a couple times when I have been
down to Arizona, including recently, about a month and a half
ago.
In your opening statement, you say that one of the things
that you seek to do is to conserve and protect the environment
of the Bureau of Land Management lands that you manage. Is that
preserving and protecting them, by allowing this dumping of
waste on the BLM lands and then not picking it up?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Yes, Congressman, there is no doubt that
illegal trash dumping is a problem all across our public lands.
I just met yesterday with some folks from New Mexico, the
Tetsuki Pueblo, who are very concerned about the amount of
trash on the Caha. Idaho has a Don't Dump on Idaho PSA campaign
running. It is, unfortunately, a real problem all across our
public lands, with people disrespecting them, and we are doing
as much as we can to ensure that we stop that behavior.
Mr. Tiffany. You are doing as much as you can? How many
dollars did you allocate for this in the Bureau of Land
Management budget?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, I don't have that number
before me.
Mr. Tiffany. I do. Zero. You put zero down. So, it is a
priority, but you don't put any money towards it. Is that what
you are saying?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, we pick up hundreds and
thousands of pounds of garbage every year on our public lands.
Mr. Tiffany. Have you met with Secretary Mayorkas about
this problem?
Ms. Stone-Manning. I have not met the Secretary.
Mr. Tiffany. When you appeared for confirmation before the
Energy and Natural Resources Committee, you made the following
statement: ``If I am confirmed as BLM Director, I will work
with the Department of Homeland Security and other relevant
departments and agencies as appropriate to address border-
related issues on the public lands.''
It has now been 951 days since you were confirmed. Were you
lying to Senator Barrasso and the Senate when you said that you
were going to work with Homeland Security to deal with this
problem?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, I know the many BLM staff
who dedicate their work day in and day out along our southern
border work daily with the Department of Homeland Security.
Mr. Tiffany. But you haven't.
Ms. Stone-Manning. I have not had direct interaction with
the Secretary, who is a very busy man.
Mr. Tiffany. So, the Director of the Bureau of Land
Management, 173 miles of southern border lands, and this is not
a priority, with nearly 200 tons of trash being dropped as a
result of illegal immigration. And you are supposed to be
preserving and protecting our best lands in the United States
of America?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, it is a really important
issue all across our public lands, and our staff works on it
each and every day.
Mr. Tiffany. Director Sams, how much is an electric
vehicle? How much does it cost to buy an electric vehicle?
Mr. Sams. It depends on the type. If we are talking light
utility vehicle or just a car, it can cost anywhere between
$25,000 to as much as $80,000.
Mr. Tiffany. Kelley Blue Book says, on average, it is about
$54,000. Does that sound about right?
Mr. Sams. Yes, sir.
Mr. Tiffany. How much is the National Park Service
proposing for the Southwest Border Resource Protection Program?
Mr. Sams. Approximately $1 million.
Mr. Tiffany. $1 million?
Mr. Sams. Yes, sir.
Mr. Tiffany. How much of that is an increase?
Mr. Sams. About $8,000, sir.
Mr. Tiffany. So, about $8,000 more, but the budget includes
$4.2 million for electric vehicles?
Mr. Sams. Yes, sir.
Mr. Tiffany. OK, so the electric vehicles are more
important than our southern border?
Mr. Sams. Oh, we are not saying that at all, sir.
Mr. Tiffany. I will yield back. I have exceeded my time.
Next, I will turn to the Ranking Member, Mr. Levin, for 5
minutes of questioning.
Mr. Levin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am going to shift
gears entirely.
I am first going to say it is nice to see Director Stone-
Manning and Director Sams. Thank you for all your good work. I
really appreciate everything you are doing for so many critical
initiatives to help protect our public lands, promote domestic
clean energy production, and provide outdoor recreation
opportunities. I want to take a moment to commend you and the
Administration for advancing historic action on climate change
and conservation, commensurate with what this moment demands.
Director Stone-Manning, I would like to begin with you and
speak about legislation I have introduced with Representative
Casten, Ranking Member Grijalva, and many of my colleagues on
the Democratic side of the aisle, the Clean Electricity and
Transmission Acceleration Act. This legislation includes an
entire title to improve renewable energy development on Federal
public lands, which mirrors my standalone bill, the Public Land
Renewable Energy Development Act.
And since we are talking about appropriations for the
agency today, at least I think that is why we are supposed to
be here, I want to dive into a specific piece of the
legislation, which is revenue sharing. Director Stone-Manning,
is it true that a portion of the receipts from oil and gas
rents and fees for drilling permits are automatically
reinvested in a special permit processing program?
Ms. Stone-Manning. It is.
Mr. Levin. And per the BLM's budget justification, this
program is just for oil and gas permitting improvement, not
renewable energy permitting improvement. Is that right?
Ms. Stone-Manning. That is correct.
Mr. Levin. Thank you. It is my understanding that this
program, known as the Permit Processing Improvement Fund, has
in some cases helped BLM to better staff certain field offices
where applications to drill for oil and gas are most
concentrated, so the agency can process permits in a timely
manner.
But when it comes to renewable energy, there is no such
permit processing improvement fund, is there?
Ms. Stone-Manning. That is correct.
Mr. Levin. And legislation would be necessary to create
one, correct?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Correct.
Mr. Levin. Thank you. Right now, 100 percent of the
revenues from acreage rents, megawatt capacity fees, bonus
bids, and other fees from renewable energy development on
public lands just go straight back to Treasury. But I think
that this current structure misses out on a very important
opportunity. My bills, both CETA and PLREDA, include a
provision to split these revenues four ways between states,
counties, permit processing, and conservation efforts, paired
with recreational access.
Director Stone-Manning, according to your testimony, as of
April 2024 there are 65 utility-scale renewable energy projects
under review by BLM, representing more than 32 gigawatts of
potential capacity to power millions of homes and create
thousands of jobs. Can you speak to how mandatory funding for
wind and solar permit processing could help your agency tackle
all of these applications?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, thanks for the question.
Not only would it help the BLM staffers who are hard at work
every day with big stacks of projects on their desks, but I
think it would also be very important to the local communities
in which these projects are placed. It would mirror the oil and
gas program so that local counties and states could receive
revenue from the great power that we are generating from hot
water, the sun, and wind.
Mr. Levin. So, am I correct in understanding that Federal
revenue from oil and gas leasing is partially dispersed to the
states where production is located?
Ms. Stone-Manning. That is correct.
Mr. Levin. And the same is not true for renewable energy
production on public lands.
Ms. Stone-Manning. That is correct.
Mr. Levin. So, I think, at the very least, we ought to
ensure that the Federal Government treats wind and solar on par
with oil and gas. Oil and gas revenue is shared with
communities, reinvested in permit processing, all while the
fossil fuel companies are making record profits and they are
enjoying structural benefits. They continue to enjoy structural
benefits in our system that have been built in over the last
century.

I would like to enter into the record a white paper from
Harvard discussing these issues more in depth.

And just in closing, Director Stone-Manning, I really
appreciate all you and your team are doing to try to level the
playing field with the two roles that your agency has
finalized, but there is clearly more to be done legislatively.
I am committed to ensuring that happens so that responsible
wind and solar development can happen at scale, and I hope to
work with my colleagues to bring parity to our energy resources
and balance the use of our public lands so that generations to
come can continue to enjoy them.
With that, I yield back.

Mr. Tiffany. Does the gentleman ask for unanimous consent
to enter that into the record?
Mr. Levin. I would love unanimous consent to enter this
into the record, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Tiffany. It is so ordered.
Mr. Levin. Thank you, sir.

Mr. Tiffany. We now turn to Representative Lamborn for his
5 minutes of questioning.
Mr. Lamborn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Director Sams, I totally appreciate our national parks. I
have been to 300 units of the National Park System.
Recently, Secretary Haaland testified in front of this
Committee. And in Colorado alone, where I have my congressional
district, there is a deferred maintenance backlog in repairs
that total $558 million. I asked her specifically if NPS is
considering looking to the concessionaire industry to support
any of these important capital investment needs. Has she spoken
to you about this?
And can you answer where NPS is in leveraging the
concessionaire industry? Concessionaires are willing to make
long-term investments if NPS has the vision to utilize this
resource.
Mr. Sams. Thank you, Congressman. The Secretary and I have
spoken about this before, and we see our concessionaires
exactly as that, helping with capitalization. They have done a
wonderful job across the Service in helping us really protect
some of our more iconic buildings, everything from the hotels
at Yosemite and Yellowstone and everywhere in between.
I have had some really great discussions with several of
our concessionaires about that and what that looks like, and we
look forward to continuing to partner with them in that,
opportunities to do that capitalization.
Mr. Lamborn. Thank you, and I was pleased to see that the
rulemaking process earlier this year finalized a rule that
updates the contracting process for concessionaires. I am
concerned about transparency. And will you commit to making
sure there is even more transparency in this process going
forward?
Mr. Sams. I welcome the opportunity to work with you on
that transparency issue. I am trying to make sure, as we are
modernizing our business practices, which is one of seven of my
initiatives that I have laid out before the staff, that is one
of them, ensuring that it is very transparent. But if you see
any issues in that, I am happy to work with you and your staff
on that.
Mr. Lamborn. Thank you so much, I appreciate that.
Director Stone-Manning, I would like to ask you some
questions about the so-called Landscape and Conservation Health
Rule which refers to mitigation and restoration leases. These
have no acreage limits. And I am concerned. How will BLM
determine an adequate price per acre for these mitigation and
restoration leases?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, thank you for the question.
What these mitigation and restoration leases are going to
enable us to do is ensure that investment can come onto public
lands to restore them so that they are healthy for future
generations. We are currently working on guidance on what kind
of rents we would charge for those, and what they would cost.
Mr. Lamborn. Will they be paying royalties like oil and gas
leases currently do?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, no, they will be charged
rent and there will be bonding.
Mr. Lamborn. OK. Now, what mechanism is in place to ensure
that environmentalists, including some of the extreme groups
out there, will use their 501(c)(3)'s to generate massive,
donation-based funding to lock up tens or hundreds of thousands
of acres of land?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, again, I need to be clear.
These leases are not going to lock up land. Other uses will be
available and allowed on the leases that are compatible, and we
will use the same adjudication process for all of our right-of-
ways that we will use for leases. And that stems from 43 CFR
2920.
Mr. Lamborn. OK. The BLM's fluid, mineral, and leasing rule
establishes a preference criterion for leases. Where do
mitigation and restoration leases rank in this criterion, in
this order of priority?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, valid existing rights on
leases will go forward. So, if there is a valid existing right
out there, we have 10 million acres that are currently leased
but not being used, that right would hold over the restoration
or the mitigation. We would look elsewhere to put a restoration
and mitigation lease.
Mr. Lamborn. BLM has stated that these leases are only
going to be necessary until the land has been restored to a
usable condition. What will be the measurement criteria that
defines when the land has been returned to a usable condition?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Thank you for that question. We do
assessment and inventorying and monitoring as part of our daily
work to have a real understanding of the ecosystems in which we
work. It will be science and data that drive the answer to that
question.
Mr. Lamborn. OK. Lastly, on a slightly different subject,
under the Biden administration we have not had lease sales
except for one in Colorado in the last 3 years. Will you commit
to holding a lease sale on the Western Slope this year in
Colorado?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, it is my understanding that
due to litigation, we have not been leasing on the Western
Slope because so much of it is tied up in litigation.
Mr. Lamborn. I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields, and I will now recognize
Ms. Porter for 5 minutes.
Ms. Porter. People love our national parks. Republicans,
kids, adults. Some of our greatest national treasures are
parks, not only for the natural beauty they provide, but also
for the history that they preserve.
Director Sams, do you know of anyone who hates the national
parks? Have you encountered people like that in your service?
Mr. Sams. I have not, Madam Congresswoman, not at all.
Ms. Porter. I have not, either. But sadly for all of us,
our national parks have been increasingly harmed by wildfire.
California has seen devastating wildfires in the last decade in
our national parks. Forests have been destroyed. Wildlife has
been vanquished, relocated, and historic structures have
burned.
[Slide.]
Ms. Porter. And I want to show people what this looks like.
These are tragic images. We should all be able to agree that
these are tragic images.
And we all know now, I want to be clear about this, we all
understand that fires are, to a certain extent, an essential
part of forest management. They are a natural part of forest
management. But we want our parks to be resilient. Mr. Sams,
can you tell me, just yes or no, does the National Park Service
have a fire resilience plan to address situations like this?
Mr. Sams. Yes, we do.
Ms. Porter. You do? Of course you do. Of course you do,
because everyone loves the national parks, and nobody wants to
see these kinds of harms.
Mr. Sams, what is the one big thing that Congress can do to
help aid wildfire resilience? When we see these images, when
our constituents see these images, what do they need their
Representatives to do?
Mr. Sams. Thank you for the question, Congresswoman.
Additional resources, the national----
Ms. Porter. Money. Let me just stop you right there,
because I am going to ask you what you are going to do with the
money in just a minute.
But I want to be really clear: money. They don't need us
suiting up and showing up, trying to fight the fire. Social
media posts don't put out wildfires or replant forests. They
need money. Congress can provide the resources.
Now, fortunately, last Congress, thanks to Democrats and
President Biden, we passed two laws: the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, and there were Republicans who supported
that, and the Inflation Reduction Act. Each law invests $5
billion into Federal wildland fire management. This is because,
just like I said, people love parks, and we want them to be
open.
Mr. Sams, how is the money that you said you need and that
Congress has allocated, how are you using that to restore
national parks that have been harmed by wildfires?
Mr. Sams. Thank you, Congresswoman. We have been allocated
$105 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for fuels
reduction and post-fire restoration and rehabilitation
activities that will mitigate the damaging effects of the
wildfires and set landscapes on a path towards natural recovery
and climate resilience. This includes planting of native and
non-native species to restore or establish healthy, stable
ecosystems, and re-establishing burned habitat, and re-
establishing native trees lost in the fire.
Ms. Porter. So, you are putting these dollars to great use.
You have led a major effort to restore, for example, historic
sequoia trees in the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park in
California that burned in 2020 and 2021. I have been there
myself unable repeatedly to visit Kings Canyon, because it is
still being affected by fire and storms.
How exactly does investing in these efforts promote
wildfire resilience? You have talked about kind of repairing
and restoring, but how about making things more resilient?
Mr. Sams. The funding helps us really look at how we are
moving forward in the face of climate change. What are the
species of plants that were out there?
In my own experience in working with tribes, and
understanding Indigenous knowledge, and how we have used that,
we, as American Indians, have seen climate change over the last
30,000 years happen at least three, if not four times, and we
have enough knowledge and understanding of what we can do to
help build a more resilient future.
Ms. Porter. Can you continue to do this work without the
$105.3 million?
Can you do this just by waving a wand? Is there a way to do
this without spending money?
Mr. Sams. Absolutely not. We need the funding in order to
be able to combat this issue.
Ms. Porter. And Mr. Sams, can you tell me which political
party proposed a budget that would cut funding for wildfire
resilience?
Mr. Sams. Ma'am, it was the Republican side.
Ms. Porter. It was not the Biden administration. Their
budget has these funds in it. So, when we look at these
pictures, like most Americans, what I feel is I feel love for
our national parks and recreation lands, and I feel a desire to
protect them. But apparently not House Republicans. They look
at these pictures and they don't seemingly feel anything at
all. They just see an opportunity to attack our national parks.
When we cut funding, we are hurting parents who have saved
all year to take their kids or grandkids camping. We are
devastating our recreation economies and we are putting lives
at risk. Fully funding the National Park Service and BLM,
protecting those investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, it is critical to the survival of our parks.
I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize the
Chairman of the Full Committee, Mr. Westerman, for his
questions.
Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Chairman Tiffany, and I want to
echo my colleague from California's concern on wildfire and for
the sequoias, and remind you we have a bipartisan bill called
the Save Our Sequoias Act. We would love to have you on that.
And also, if we would do a little bit more management, we
wouldn't have to spend so much money on wildfires and the
damage that they do. It is really a great example of how an
ounce of prevention is worth many, many pounds of cure when it
comes to our forests.
But Director Sams, it is good to see you again. I enjoyed
our meeting last week with some of my folks from Arkansas with
the Department of Parks, Heritage, and Tourism, with Secretary
Lewis, Heritage Division Director Ryall, and First Gentleman
Bryan Sanders to discuss outdoor recreation opportunities in
Arkansas, and to talk about the ways the state can partner with
the National Park Service on promoting tourism, and how the
states and the Federal land agencies could work together and
benefit both.
As we discussed and I mentioned in my opening remarks, I
know we had a chance to talk about the Buckstaff bathhouse, and
that may sound like a pet project because it is one in the
national park in my hometown, but it is also concerning to know
that there were plans to shut down a facility that would cause
37 people to lose their jobs. And this bathhouse has been open
since 1912, the Buckstaff has. I know you were going to look
into that. I just wanted to get an update to see if you can
tell me if those folks are going to be able to keep their job
and maybe do a little different planning on how to install the
HVAC, which is obviously needed and appreciated.
Mr. Sams. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for
convening the meeting last week. It was a pleasure to meet
several of your folks from your home state and have discussions
with them. And I have met several of them before. And even
through social media we continue to visit with each other to
talk about what a wonderful asset we have there for folks to
enjoy.
We are continuing to work on that issue, to figure out how
best to ensure that we are not going to lose that staff,
including discussion even now on how much longer we can extend
that particular concessionaire's contract.
We have not gone out for a total bid yet to talk about who
we are going to end up working with, especially on the HVAC
system, to determine how we can do a work-around so that folks
can continue to do their work.
Mr. Westerman. Yes. As an engineer in my former life, I can
tell you there are multiple ways to do that, and I am pretty
sure people put HVAC systems in before without having to lose
their whole workforce.
Now, turning to a different direction, we have talked a lot
about Floyd Bennett Field. I made a trip up there, met with
your colleagues on that Park Service facility. And maybe I am
not too good at reading people, but I think I could see in the
faces of those folks up there that they weren't real happy
about making their national park a migrant shelter. And I
really believe that was way above the level of the Park
Service. I believe that decision was made way above the level
of the Interior Department. The more we research this, the more
that it appears it was Department of Homeland Security working
directly with the White House that forced this migrant shelter
to be built on Park Service land. And amazingly, we saw our so-
called bedrock environmental laws waived within a week or two
so that this construction could happen.
I know that that lease ends on September 14 of this year.
Can you commit to not renewing that lease, or is that above
your level of commitment?
Mr. Sams. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Within the lease it does allow for a 1-year extension of
that lease, but I can assure you I am currently in no
discussions or negotiations with the city of New York about
that extension at this time.
Mr. Westerman. So, can you commit that no other national
parks are turned into migrant encampments?
Mr. Sams. Mr. Chairman, I know that you have asked for a
lot of information on this, and we have provided that. I don't
have the most current information in front of me, but I am
happy to get back to you on that particular question.
Mr. Westerman. As the weather is getting nicer, and local
New Yorkers are looking to get outside and use recreational
sites and facilities including the beach at Floyd Bennett
Field, can you commit to at least increasing the police
presence there at this site to ensure the safety of local
residents?
Mr. Sams. Under the lease agreement we have been able to
add additional patrols from the U.S. Park Police, who are
helping on those issues and providing security and safe
enjoyment of the park. It is, specifically under the lease, the
New York City Police Department's responsibility for the
migrant camp itself. But we will continue to ensure that all of
our visitors are safe within our parks.
Mr. Westerman. There have been multiple arrests at the
Floyd Bennett Field facility, for instance, ranging from
assault to domestic violence. Since those reports have come
out, what has the Park Service done to protect the safety of
Park Service employees and local residents?
Mr. Sams. For the latest data, I can't speak, Mr. Chairman,
I can't speak to it directly. And I am happy to talk to you in
more detail and provide you written information about where we
are at in that.
But I recognize that, just from the information I have
received from the park police is that it is mostly around
unregistered cars that we are seeing, and some minor, petty
stuff. But I am happy to get you a more detailed report.
Mr. Westerman. All right, I would like to see that.
Also included in the priority project request under the
Great American Outdoors Act for the National Park Service there
was $40 million in repairs for the Gateway National Recreation
Area, which includes Floyd Bennett Field. Will putting 2,000
migrants at Floyd Bennett Field impact the timeline of
completing this work?
Mr. Sams. Thank you. I don't believe it will at this time.
Those projects are part of our deferred maintenance package
that have been on for a long time and made the business case,
and we will continue to work forward to ensure that those
investments are placed in the park for everyone's enjoyment.
Mr. Westerman. And Mr. Chairman, I thought the clock was
going the other way. I yield back the microphone because I am
way out of time. Thank you for your indulgence.
Mr. Tiffany. The Chairman yields, and now I recognize Mr.
McClintock for 5 minutes.
Mr. McClintock. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First, I need to offer a word in response to the opening
statement by the Ranking Member. He obsesses over a 1 degree
increase in global temperatures over the next century, but he
couldn't care less that the Democrats' policies are making it
harder and harder for families to afford to heat their homes,
purchase groceries, or drive their cars to work, or even have
work to drive to. These policies are madness, and they are now
having a terrible effect on the prices that Americans have to
pay for everything from gasoline and electricity to automobiles
and light bulbs. Europeans are already waking up to this
lunacy, and I think Americans will soon follow.
I also need to respond to Ms. Porter. I would remind her
that half the forests in California are privately owned. The
private forests are healthy, resilient, and fire resistant
because their owners manage their forests and match the timber
density to the ability of the land to support it. And they make
money doing that. We need to do the same thing. We used to.
A fourth of the funds from Federal timber auctions used to
go to local communities that were affected by the forests, and
the other 75 percent went to the Forest Service to manage our
forests. The environmental laws of the 1970s now require an
average of 4\1/2\ years of studies before we can undertake a
forest thinning project. They cost millions of dollars more
than the value of the timber to be harvested.
So, private landowners keep their lands in excellent
condition and they make money. Federal land managers have kept
our forests in decrepit condition under these laws and they
lose money. That is not the fault of taxpayers for not paying
enough taxes. That is the fault of the very policies that my
friend from California has spent her career advocating.
In fact, according to a recent UCLA study, the 2020
wildfires in California released twice as much carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere as all of the CO
2
reductions
that they imposed in that state between 2003 and 2019 combined,
and at a staggering cost to taxpayers, consumers, and
employees.
Mr. Sams, I have Yosemite National Park in my district, and
I want to address management issues there that are a continuing
nightmare for park visitors. And they have become an economic
disaster for the gateway communities that depend on park
visitation.
Crowding exists in the Valley, but the Valley isn't the
sole destination for visitors, yet the reservation system
doesn't make this distinction, nor does it distinguish between
peak visitation periods and slack periods. And, far worse, it
makes it impossible for spontaneous trips to the park by those
in the general region.
In a memo to your management there at Yosemite, the gateway
businesses noted the experience with the reservations problem.
And here are some of the things they noted: uncertainty
regarding access for those who want to visit Yosemite from out
of state or internationally; and the existence of a ticketing
system inhibiting visitation generally; ticket hoarding by
locals; complexity, confusion, and frustration for visitors;
unfairly advantaging lodge properties inside the park; greater
congestion at entry gates; and rigidity and inability to
respond to real-time events based on actual demand pressure.
These are what the locals have actually observed there.
I have written to you to ask that the Park Service not
finalize the reservation system until other alternatives are
explored. And as I wrote to you a month ago, rather than seeing
what pressure points remain the pilot system is overly onerous
and restrictive to the public in several areas, which will mask
opportunities to create a more appropriate, minimal, public-
friendly, long-term solution. So, what are you doing to take
this into account?
Mr. Sams. Thank you for the question, Congressman and, yes,
this is a huge issue across the Service as we see more and more
folks wanting to come to their parks, and we are trying to work
very hard and recognizing that, of course, what works at one
park may not work at another.
Mr. McClintock. Well, what you are doing at Yosemite is not
working, and yet you don't seem to be taking that into account
in plowing ahead.
I have to tell you, candidly, that the gateway communities
feel the current park management is entirely insulated and
disinterested in their input and feedback. In fact, when I met
with them a few months ago, the park management was invited to
attend, but instead they blew us off.
A few years ago, I took note of a sign in the conference
room at Yosemite. It posed a question, ``Is it good for the
park?'' Well, I suggested then and I repeat today that that is
precisely the wrong question. The right question is, ``Is it
good for the park's visitors?'' And I will tell you, my
assessment is that this is an attitude problem that runs deep,
deep in the Park Service. And if you can't correct it, we are
going to need to find somebody who can.
The best visitor experience that has been reported to me at
Yosemite over the years that I have represented it came during
the shutdown during the Trump administration. During the Obama
shutdown, the Park Service canceled all events, it ordered all
businesses to be shuttered, it chained all the entrances, it
even blocked turnouts overlooking the Valley so people couldn't
even stop to get a glimpse of the park from afar. However,
during the Trump shutdown, the park gates were kept open,
concessionaires continued to operate. And except for a brief
period when the concessionaire had to arrange for alternative
trash collections, visitors reported that they had a much
better, hassle-free experience without the Park Service being
on duty.
Now, what does that say about the park management when
their absence leads to a better visitor experience than their
presence?
Mr. Sams. Thank you for the question. Well, first and
foremost is that we ended up having to do a lot of remediation
during that time period, and we are continuing to do that
remediation.
Last summer, I had the good chance of enjoying some of
Yosemite, and seeing how many folks come in and truly enjoy it.
The balance under the Organic Act, of course, is how do we
protect these cultural and natural resources while ensuring
that it is open for the enjoyment of the American public? It is
a very tough balancing act that we are looking at, and we want
to work very closely with the gateway communities, with your
counties, and with you.
Mr. McClintock. Yes, but you are not. That is simple, empty
rhetoric. I am telling you that your management is not. And
that is the experience of these gateway communities, and it is
a growing frustration.
I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields. I now turn to the
Representative from Oregon, Mr. Bentz, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Bentz. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank the witnesses
for their presence today.
Director Stone-Manning, I have a bunch of questions, no
surprise given the size of my district, some 46 million acres,
73,000 square miles, a huge portion of which is Bureau of Land
Management-managed.
I want to start with the Fiscal Responsibility Act. And in
it there are a number of refinements, amendments to NEPA. And I
am just anxious to know if the BLM has initiated rulemaking to
incorporate those new time frames for your NEPA work. Have you
initiated rulemaking in that regard?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Thank you, Congressman, for the
question. We have issued guidance on ensuring that we meet
those new timelines of a year for an EA and 2 years for an EIS,
and also the page limits within.
Mr. Bentz. If you would be so kind as to provide me with
that guidance, I would appreciate it.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Yes.
Mr. Bentz. Now the second question. The Cascade-Siskiyou
National Monument, I think you now have management duties,
authority over it. And, of course, it is in my district. And I
have been speaking with some of the ranchers who have grazing
permits on that space, and they have been notified that their
leases that they have many times had for decades will not be
renewed. Is that your understanding?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, we are right in the middle
of a resource management plan for Cascade-Siskiyou and, of
course, that is a transparent, open, and public process. I am
assuming and hoping that your constituents engage in that
process.
Mr. Bentz. Well, that does not answer the question. Of
course, they have engaged, and they have said, ``We don't want
our permits not renewed.'' So, my question to you is, will
their permits be renewed under any circumstances?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, the proclamation that
established that national monument allows for grazing.
Mr. Bentz. Say that again, please.
Ms. Stone-Manning. The proclamation that established that
monument allows for grazing.
Mr. Bentz. OK. I read the proclamation pretty carefully. I
didn't see that in it. So, you are telling me, and I am very
happy to hear it, that if it allows for grazing, that is really
good news. It is not in the proclamation.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Then I stand corrected.
Mr. Bentz. Yes, well, I am happy for what you are doing.
Don't get me wrong. I want those permits renewed.
The conservation rule, it came up a little earlier and I
think you used the word ``compatible.'' It is odd, because that
conservation rule suggests that it is on par, conservation,
with the other multiple uses. But I would suggest what that
does is give the agency authority to, I hate to call it
``without regard to rules,'' but to do whatever it would like.
Do you read it that way?
Because if you look at it, if you think about it for a
moment, conservation being a preservation sort of a thing, it
seems to be the exact opposite of, shall we say, any extractive
activity, whether it is grazing, logging, or mining. Tell me
how you reconcile the obvious difference between conservation
on the one hand, and an extractive activity on the other.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, thank you for the question,
and you have gotten right to the heart of why our work is
difficult and engaging, the multiple use mission.
And the Federal Land Policy and Management Act has been
clear, it is explicitly clear, that multiple use includes
managing for recreation, watersheds, fish and wildlife habitat,
and natural, scenic, and cultural values. It establishes
conservation as a use. And what this rulemaking does is put
some consistency in how we lift up that portion of FLPMA to
ensure that future generations 30, 40, 50 years from now get to
enjoy our public lands the way that we do today.
Mr. Bentz. Right. I haven't heard the answer to my
question. If these are opposite uses, then how in the world
will you ever find compatibility?
Because you are saying that, indeed, you could have mining
and at the same time conservation.
Ms. Stone-Manning. The other thing that FLPMA tells us is
that we don't have to have all the uses on every single acre.
So, a hard rock mine is a great example. We are not going to
have recreation and mountain biking in an open pit.
Mr. Bentz. Excuse me for interrupting. That is not the way
I read your rule. I read your rule as imposing upon all
activities, multiple use or not, this conservation overlay. But
if I am wrong, please provide me with the data so indicating.
I want to go to the O&C lands over which you have
management and control. For years, the O&C lands have not been
producing the amount or allowed to produce the amount of timber
that the law requires. Can you explain why?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, we are upholding the O&C
Act, and we are upholding the resource management plan that
implements that. ASQ for Fiscal Year 2024 is 132 million board
feet.
Mr. Bentz. Yes, I will just say that the facts that I have
here indicate otherwise, but I am out of time.
But if you will provide me with the information that
indicates you have been abiding by the requirements of that
law, I would appreciate it.
I yield back. Thank you.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the
gentleman from Minnesota for 5 minutes.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I find it really
unbelievable that those are the rules and regs under this
Administration. And what I would hope, and at this point, that
the loggers that log those, they didn't hit any tree spikes or
nails intentionally placed in there. So, those rules and regs
are unbelievable for this Administration.
At Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota, the Park
Service is changing policies relating to Conditional Use
Authorizations, or CUAs, which are required for local
businesses that provide services that increase access to the
park. Under the new policies, local operators can no longer
stack CUA applications for similar activities. They must now
pay additional fees and submit individual applications for each
activity or service they would like to provide for the local
community and visitors to the park. These are costing local
businesses thousands of dollars in additional fees just to
process an application. Some of these operators have shared
they will likely have to close up shop because this additional
red tape is making it no longer cost effective to operate their
business.
To their credit, the leadership at Voyageurs National Park
has worked closely with the operators to find a solution, but
it is national policies set by the Park Service headquarters
here in Washington that are forcing them to make these changes.
Director Sams, without partnership operators, would the Park
Service be able to provide the same recreational opportunities
that they do today?
Mr. Sams. Thank you, Congressman. Voyageurs National Park
has held discussions, as you have said, and workshops with the
public for the past year regarding the plan to manage frozen
lake access, of course. This summer the park will embark on
the----
Mr. Stauber. Director Sams, excuse me. I only have a couple
of minutes left. Without these partnerships, would the Park
Service be able to provide the same recreational opportunities
that they do today?
Mr. Sams. We will continue to work to do our best to ensure
that we offer those same activities.
Mr. Stauber. Without the operators?
Mr. Sams. No, sir, in partnership with the operators.
Mr. Stauber. What actions is the Service taking to ensure
these small and local businesses are able to reasonably operate
and provide access for the American people?
That is the mission statement, right, for the American
people to be able to enjoy the parks?
Mr. Sams. Yes, sir.
Mr. Stauber. OK. What actions are you taking?
Mr. Sams. As we are modernizing these concessionaire
practices and talking about transparency, and we will work
towards transparency in every way so that we can demonstrate
that we are getting a fair deal for the American people, we
want to ensure that the multiple uses of recreation that happen
in Voyageurs, which is a fantastic park, will continue in the
future. And I am very proud of the team that is working to
ensure that we are providing additional support on what that
will look like and how to----
Mr. Stauber. And that is why I said in my statement, the
Park Service Director is doing a good job trying to work but he
is following your policies on the CUAs.
So, I would ask you to look into that because I think, if
we lose those operators, we are going to lose access to the
park for the people if operators go out of business. Will you
commit to reviewing the national policies that are running
counter to the Service's mission to provide opportunities for
public use and enjoyment of our parks?
Mr. Sams. I will take this concern directly back to my
staff and look at our CUAs, and see what we are doing.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you. I hope these policies are seriously
addressed by you. I appreciate it.
Mr. Sams. Thank you.
Mr. Stauber. Director Stone-Manning, in the BLM's recent
Waste Prevention Rule, the Bureau admits that venting and
flaring usually occurs due to pipeline capacity constraints.
What steps is the Bureau taking to expedite rights-of-way
approval for oil and gas infrastructure that prevent flaring,
such as gathering lines?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, thank you for the question.
Our folks on the ground work hard every day processing
the----
Mr. Stauber. What steps are you taking to expedite right-
of-way approval for oil and gas infrastructure that prevent
flaring, such as gathering lines?
Ms. Stone-Manning. When gathering lines come before us, we
jump right to it and go through the process.
Mr. Stauber. How many gathering line applications are in
your office right now, do you think?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, I don't have that in front
of me. I can get that to you.
Mr. Stauber. Do you know what a gathering line is?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Yes.
Mr. Stauber. Explain it.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Are you playing stump the director,
Congressman?
An oil and gas gathering line, as the name implies, enables
the facility to get their product to the larger pipelines that
are going to get it on to the Gulf or wherever it is going.
Mr. Stauber. The gathering lines are part of a categorical
exclusion, right? CATEX?
Ms. Stone-Manning. We do have CATEX for gathering lines.
And if I recall correctly, this is old, this is from probably 6
or 8 months ago, I think we have only used it one time because
we have only had one ask.
Mr. Stauber. One ask? Are you just saying you have one
request for a gathering line in your office today?
Ms. Stone-Manning. No, Congressman, as I mentioned, that is
from about 6 or 8 months ago. But I recall that being the
number.
Mr. Stauber. Would you please get back to our office on the
number of gathering lines that are waiting?
Ms. Stone-Manning. I would.
Mr. Stauber. OK, thank you.
Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields.
I would like to ask unanimous consent to enter into the
record the BLM budget proposal for public domain forest
management. The budget makes no mention of the wildfire risk 5-
year monitoring, maintenance, and treatment plan for the second
year in a row, and actually proposed a decrease in the planned
acres to treat from Fiscal Year 2023.
The BLM budget also has a proposed decrease of over a half
million dollars, resulting in 50,000 less seedlings being
planted for restoration efforts.
Without objection, so entered into the record, the BLM
budget proposal.

Mr. Tiffany. Representative Stauber.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Real quick, I ask
unanimous consent to enter into the record this article from
the Wall Street Journal entitled, ``Why the World Has Gone
Cuckoo for Copper,'' dated May 14 of 2024.
Mr. Tiffany. Without objection, so ordered.

[The information follows:]
Why the World Has Gone Cuckoo for Copper

The U.S. and China are competing to acquire the metal essential for EVs
and data centers. It is also at the center of a $43 billion takeover
battle.

Wall Street Journal, May 14, 2024 by Julie Steinberg

https://www.wsj.com/business/why-the-world-has-gone-cuckoo-for-copper-
ef8c385a

*****

After one of the world's top copper producers recently hit a financial
crunch, the Biden administration started huddling with potential
investors about taking a stake in the company's Zambian mines worth as
much as $3 billion.

The search isn't restricted to American companies, with entities from
the United Arab Emirates, Japan and Saudi Arabia--all viewed as
friendly to U.S. interests--expressing interest in the stake in First
Quantum Minerals' FM 7.53% assets, according to people familiar with
the matter.

The goal is simple: to keep it out of Chinese control and prevent the
Asian superpower from tightening its grip over the global supply of
crucial metals and minerals.

The bidding, expected to be concluded later this year, is part of a
global rush to acquire more copper, a key component in everything from
electric cars to transmission lines and the data centers powering the
AI revolution.

BHP Group's record nearly $43 billion takeover bid for Anglo American,
which was rejected Monday, puts a fresh spotlight on the intense demand
for copper. While London-listed Anglo produces a range of commodities,
from diamonds to nickel, Australia's BHP has made clear that it most
prizes the company's copper assets. Anglo rebuffed BHP's first offer
last month, and other companies are believed to be weighing rival bids.

On Tuesday, Anglo announced its own turnaround plan, saying it would
get out of its platinum, diamond and steelmaking coal businesses--
effectively pitching investors on a strategy that makes copper even
more central to the company's future.

Chief Executive Duncan Wanblad said on a media call that the company
would look at growing its copper business both organically and from
potential mergers and acquisitions, such as taking greater stakes in
assets it already owns.

``Copper of course is the story of the day,'' he said.

While the U.S. government doesn't have any oversight over a proposed
deal, officials have communicated to Anglo executives that they are
concerned consolidation could limit the overall supply of copper, said
people familiar with the matter. The U.S. is also concerned that China
could put pressure on BHP to sell some assets or agree to sell more of
its copper to the country to address potential anticompetitive
concerns.

For the U.S., the current frenzy highlights the importance of its
yearslong effort to build up supplies of the metals and minerals
critical to the green-energy transition.

Demand for copper is expected to rise as certain mines close or scale
back production. Copper futures are up 20% this year.

The U.S. doesn't have a ministry for mining, a sovereign wealth-fund or
much of a domestic mining industry. That has put it at a disadvantage
with China, which can direct its state-owned enterprises to invest
heavily no matter how commodity prices are performing.

The U.S. government is limited in how much money it can directly pump
into projects of national security. That means it must work with
private companies at home and abroad, as well as friendly countries
with sovereign-wealth funds, to entice them to invest in assets helpful
to national interests.

The Wall Street Journal reported last year, for example, that the U.S.
and Saudi Arabia have held talks for potential agreements in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, under which Saudi Arabia would take
stakes in mines and U.S. companies would be guaranteed some of the
rights to production.

One of President Biden's senior advisers, Amos Hochstein, is a linchpin
of this effort. Hochstein and a small team at the State Department have
been flying around the world, meeting with government officials in sub-
Saharan Africa one day and with U.S. investors the next.

Regarding copper, ``We don't have a lot of new supply coming online
around the world,'' Hochstein said in an interview. ``What concerns me
is even when a discovery is made, it could take between seven and 15
years before the first copper comes out.''

The U.S. has committed more than $1 billion to the Lobito Corridor to
develop local infrastructure, including clean power and a railroad
connecting Angola, Congo and Zambia to export critical minerals. Also
in Zambia, the U.S. last year urged the U.A.E. to consider investing in
Mopani Copper Mines, according to people familiar with the matter.

The effort was successful: Zambia in December chose the U.A.E.'s
International Resources Holding as a new equity partner.

Hochstein declined to comment on specific deals.

Hochstein said he and his team have made clear to African governments
that the U.S. is trying to put forward an alternative model that won't
result in debt, corruption and environmental degradation.

``We are putting our money where our mouth is,'' he said.

A central part of the U.S. effort is the International Development
Finance Corp., a federal agency that helps finance projects overseas.
The agency agreed to invest $740 million last year in the mining
sector, up from $245 million it had committed to legacy mining
projects.

It is currently in talks to finance a multibillion-dollar copper mine
in Pakistan that, when it comes online in 2028, will be among the
world's largest copper projects, according to people familiar with the
matter.

An Irish company called TechMet is one of its signature investments.
Under the Trump and Biden administrations, the agency has given TechMet
some $105 million in funding and become its second-largest shareholder.
An investment firm backed by a scion of the Walton family also invested
in the most recent fundraising round, which valued the company at more
than $1 billion.

``We are in a second Cold War,'' said TechMet CEO Brian Menell, a South
African. ``One has to increasingly pick sides. For me it's never been a
moment's doubt. It is a competition between Western values and
dictatorship.''

TechMet owns stakes in lithium, cobalt, nickel, vanadium and rare-earth
miners.

Meanwhile, Chinese miners, with government backing, are rapidly
snapping up assets. In Belt and Road countries, which don't include
Brazil or Australia, China spent more than $19 billion last year on
metals and mining investments, up 158% from 2022, according to the
Green Finance & Development Center at Fudan University in Shanghai.
That is the highest level since 2013.

In the latest example, a Chinese firm is in advanced talks to buy
Chemaf, a metals producer that is developing a cobalt and copper mine
in Congo, according to people familiar with the matter.

At least two Western suitors were interested in buying the company,
according to people familiar with the matter, including Chilean Cobalt
Corp., or C3, a U.S. company with copper-cobalt operations in northern
Chile.

Duncan Blount, chief executive of C3, said he spoke with the
International Development Finance Corp and State Department about
making a bid, but concluded it would have been too expensive. Still, he
said, ``They were incredibly helpful on this venture and other
projects. They're keen to see American businesses and entrepreneurs go
back into Congo.''

Mr. Tiffany. I now recognize Ms. Hoyle from the great state
of Oregon.
Ms. Hoyle. Thank you very much.
Director Stone-Manning, hello. I know we have spoken many
times before. Today, I specifically would like to discuss with
you the Western Oregon Operating Plan, which is an agreement
between the Bureau of Land Management, the Oregon Department of
Forestry, Douglas Forest Protective Association, Coos Forest
Protective Association, and tribes.
And we have in Oregon a very unique, checkerboard map where
private, tribal, Federal, and state lands are all on a
checkerboard, so it makes it difficult to fight fires unless we
are all cooperating together.
The entire Oregon Delegation, Democrats and Republicans,
have made it very clear and signed letters to say that we want
the WOOP to remain in place. So, I would like to ask for your
commitment to make sure that that happens.
And secondarily, it is my understanding that it is on the
table from the BLM to remove Coos Bay and Roseburg from the
WOOP because they are wet forests. Let me tell you, we had the
Agnes Fire that was down in Curry County coming up into Coos
County that burned from July through the fall. We have also had
fires in Roseburg, where there is a large population.
The bottom line is that, with climate change, with drier
conditions we are seeing fires that are different and that are
coming into the wildland-urban interface and putting our
populations in danger. We know that it costs more to fight
fires in Oregon than it does in other places, and also that
almost 99 percent of the forest land that the BLM manages is in
the O&C lands, is in Oregon.
So, I would like your commitment on keeping the WOOP in
place, and also a commitment to do more research before you
even think of moving forward in taking Coos Bay and Roseburg
out from the WOOP. Thank you.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, thank you for the question.
Of course, protecting our communities and our landscapes is a
huge priority for the BLM.
I was pleased to meet with you about WOOP. I have been
working with Director Barry Bushue on this topic. He is in
negotiations, practically as we speak, with ODF and the Fire
Protective Association. I am confident that we will reach
agreement by the time that the WOOP is up in June.
And I couldn't agree more, fires are becoming harder,
longer, and more intense on the landscape, which is in part why
it is so important that we get a handle on the climate crisis,
which is why you see the budget before you that you do.
Ms. Hoyle. Thank you. Just to follow up, I know that
negotiations are happening. I know that there are financial
considerations. I can tell you that what I have seen in the
time that I have been in Oregon is that we short change the
money up front in preventing wildfires from happening and
debris removal, and then we will write an unlimited check when
we are losing millions of acres to these extreme wildfires.
And what, again, I want to impress upon you is just because
you are looking at the south coast as a wet forest, the fact of
the matter is people's lives, people's homes, and our beautiful
forests are in danger. And again, it is a very complex area.
And what we have seen since the fires in 2020 is great
cooperation between the Feds and the state and our private
wildland firefighters, our professional firefighters, our
tribal fire management and firefighters. We would like to see
that continue.
But again, I do not think, and I seriously, seriously hope
that the thought of pulling Coos Bay and Roseburg from the WOOP
is not something we are considering, and that is off the table.
And I really would like your commitment on that.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, thank you for the question.
My commitment is we will actively fight fire and do our job
to fight fire all throughout your district. And the agreement
of who pays for it, and how and when and where is what is on
the table. What is not on the table is doing our part to ensure
that we keep people and places safe.
Ms. Hoyle. So, again, to follow up, and I am sorry I am out
of time, but I want to be abundantly clear. Representative
Bentz and I share Roseburg as a district, the district splits
at Roseburg, and the south coast and Coos Bay. It is vitally
important that that stay in the WOOP. And if that isn't going
to happen, I want to make sure that you alert our office before
any decisions are made.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congresswoman, you have my commitment
that you will know before any decisions are made.
[Pause.]
Mr. Tiffany. Does the gentlelady yield?
Ms. Hoyle. Yes, I yield.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentlelady yields. I would now like to
recognize Representative Moylan for 5 minutes.
Mr. Moylan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding the
hearing, of course, and giving us the opportunity to speak with
Director Stone-Manning and Director Sams.
Thank you to the panel for being here and regarding the
upcoming budget of the National Park Service and how they plan
to effectively utilize it.
My district of Guam is home to 50 parks, including the War
in the Pacific National Historic Park and Asan, which
commemorates the bravery and sacrifice of those serving in the
Pacific theater of World War II. It is important that Guam and
the National Park Service work together to protect these sites
so that future generations can appreciate them as we do now.
Additionally, nearly one-third of my island is owned by the
Federal Government. However, our local park officers are
stretched thin. They face serious personnel shortages, which
impacts their ability to take care of these lands. So, it is
critical that the Department of the Interior do everything that
they can to conserve and protect our island's natural beauty.
Director Stone-Manning, regarding the 30x30 program, does
the Administration consult with local and Indigenous groups on
if and how a land should be preserved?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, thank you for the question.
Sort of at the heart of the President's America the Beautiful
initiative is locally-led, collaborative conservation.
Mr. Moylan. Thank you, Director Stone-Manning.
Unfortunately, the Administration has shown that it does not
care about the local and Indigenous groups' experience on what
is best for their lands. Rather, the Administration oversteps
and acts without regard to local stakeholders.
I would like to bring to the Committee's attention the
Pacific remote island Marianas National Monument, specifically
the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument. This status was
granted despite strong local opposition from my constituents
and the democratically-elected government of Guam. It is very
unfortunate our voice wasn't heard.
Director Sams, in 2019, the National Park Service began
consideration for designating Manenggon Concentration Camp as a
National Historic Landmark. As the public comment period
remains ongoing, could you speak on the ongoing National
Landmarks Committee meeting, and provide an update on the
general comment period?
Mr. Sams. Thank you for the question. I don't have that
right before me, but I am happy to get that back to you in
writing about our most recent meeting on that issue, and
provide you all the information.
Mr. Moylan. I appreciate that, especially now that we have
a special Liberation Day coming up, our 80th anniversary, the
liberation day of Guam, and that will be important information
I would like to have. Thank you.
Mr. Sams. Yes, sir. I am hoping to get out there. My
grandfather fought in World War II aboard a destroyer, USS
Converse, and had talked about the invasion of Guam.
Mr. Moylan. I appreciate it. Director Sams, in January
2023, the President signed into law the Guam National Heritage
Area Feasibility Study. My office has yet to receive any
updates on the status of this study. When does the NPS
anticipate the completion of the study, and how can we expedite
this?
Mr. Sams. Thank you for the question. I don't know the
exact date, but I will get you the exact date in writing, and
give you an update. I am happy to work with you and your staff
on that.
Mr. Moylan. OK, we will work closely, and I appreciate
that. Thank you.
And finally, Director Sams, the National Park Service has
designated the War in the Pacific National Historic Park fifth
in line with the supplemental funding request, fifth. This is a
serious, underfunded, and understaffed Federal park suffering
from flood damage, monuments are falling apart, and
infrastructure which is on its last legs.
Director Sams, could you speak to what must happen for the
National Historic Park to be considered higher priority by your
agency?
Mr. Sams. As I understand it, we have like $2.6 million to
preserve the World War II structures at the War in the Pacific
National Historic Park proposed in Fiscal Year's 2025 budget.
And we understand that we also have more than $240,000 in
maintenance action team projects that will go towards that. It
is proposed in our 2025 budget.
Mr. Moylan. But we are still fifth in line with the
supplemental funding request. Are you saying that it is no
longer there, that you have funded it, or are we fifth in line
still for supplemental funding?
Mr. Sams. I am going to defer to my comptroller on where we
are at with that, Ms. Jessica Bowron.
Ms. Bowron. The Administration submitted a disaster
supplemental request in the fall for disasters that occurred in
2023. No disaster supplemental appropriation was received with
the Fiscal Year 2024 appropriation, so we are currently
evaluating how to best recover from disasters across the
country within available funding.
Mr. Moylan. All right. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the
gentlelady from California, Ms. Kamlager-Dove.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to
the witnesses for coming here today.
Director Stone-Manning, we have heard a lot about oil and
gas companies over the last few weeks, and not all of it has
been good. Just last week, a report came out finding that
Donald Trump asked Big Oil for $1 billion for his campaign. And
in return, he would roll back environmental regulations.
Earlier this month, we found out from the FTC that Pioneer
Resources, which is currently merging with Exxon, colluded with
OPEC to pad their pockets and keep prices high for American
families. Market manipulation.
At the same time, Republicans here in Congress are somehow
calling it Biden's war on American energy, while at the same
time Big Oil continues to break records for both production and
profit. It is not adding up to me, but of course it is not, and
these conversations we continue to have around that are really
exhausting.
Once again, Republicans on this Committee are trying to
blame things like environmental regulations and the new BLM oil
and gas rule which finally provides a better return for the
American taxpayer. I say they are continuing to gaslight the
American people. These complaints line up directly with the
talking points of Big Oil lobbyists who decried the rule while
making record profits and showering their shareholders in
billions through dividends and stock buybacks.
In fact, one oil executive actually came here and said he
didn't even like to read. He didn't want to read rules. It was
just too much, which I find very hard to understand.
One of their biggest gripes is about the new bonding
provisions, calling them expensive and onerous. But these
regulations will actually provide taxpayers and communities
from having to clean up after the oil and gas industry.
But before this final rule, these rates hadn't been updated
in over a half century. Between 1951 and now, companies could
pay as little as $25,000 to cover all of their oil wells in a
state. Between 1960 and now, companies could pay as little as
$10,000 to cover all their wells on a lease. These rates
haven't been updated to account for inflation, nor have they
tracked technological advancements, including well depth, which
substantially increases mitigation costs.
So, to do a little comparison, Director Stone-Manning, wind
and solar projects on public lands must also be bonded to
ensure that the public lands they are sited on are reclaimed
after a project. Is this correct?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Yes.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. OK. It is my understanding that BLM set
minimum bond rates for wind and solar in 2016, and that the
regulations dictate that those minimums be adjusted for
inflation periodically. Is that correct?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Yes.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. OK. So, just for the record, these
regulations require wind and solar developers to pay as much as
$20,000 per wind turbine, or $20,000 per acre of solar panels,
or $10,000 per acre for solar in priority areas. Considering
some proposed wind projects consist of several hundred turbines
and some solar projects are thousands of acres in size, it is
not a stretch to say that these bonds can often be quite more
expensive than bonds covering oil and gas wells.
Last question for you. Do you know of any utility-scale
wind or solar projects on Federal public land, or even on just
BLM land that are orphaned or abandoned?
Ms. Stone-Manning. I do not, Congresswoman.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Right. Neither do I. Yet, we have oil
and gas wells that have been orphaned and abandoned.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Yes.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Yes, OK. So, I just think it is worth
noting that I have never heard of a pollution disaster caused
by end-of-life solar or wind projects, unlike the environmental
and public health crises my constituents deal with every day
due to oil and gas wells.
We have heard so many complaints from my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle and from industry about the new
$150,000 minimum bond for oil and gas leases, or the new
$500,000 minimum for a bond covering of all wells statewide.
But if wind and solar companies can afford to insure their
sites are mitigated and reclaimed, then the multi-billion-
dollar oil and gas company certainly can do that as well. Do
you agree?
Ms. Stone-Manning. I do agree, Congresswoman. And, of
course, what it is going to do is it protect the American
taxpayer so that they are not left holding the bag in the
future.
Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Thank you, and I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. The lady yields. I now recognize the gentleman
from Montana for 5 minutes.
Mr. Rosendale. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I am sorry that I
can't see you behind that large stack of regulations that you
presented there. I appreciate you holding this crucial budget
hearing today.
The BLM plays a vital role in management and facilitation
of our land out West, especially in Montana, where BLM land
comprises nearly one-third of our state. However, under the
current radical administration, we witnessed a harmful trend
where BLM's land management decisions are working against the
very communities and residents the agency is meant to serve.
Whether it is the lack of leasing opportunities, the war
being waged against the coal industry, or the ongoing efforts
to restrict access to Montana's productive lands, it is clear
to me that, despite being from our great state, Director Stone-
Manning and her agency's priorities are at complete odds with
what is in the best interest of Montana. I am eager to hear
from both her and Director Sams about why they believe they
deserve a $120 million increase in total funding.
Ranking Member Neguse, I am sorry that you were not here to
hear the filibuster from Ms. Porter and Mr. Levin about revenue
and the income that these lands are supposed to produce,
because what they failed to reference is the fact that capacity
and rental fees have been reduced for renewables, renewable
energy, capacity and rental fees by 80 percent. By 80 percent.
And that is after they have already been heavily, heavily
subsidized by the taxpayers across this nation.
Director Sams, speaking of reducing fees, why did the
National Park Service relinquish control of RFK complex,
instead of leveraging it for our park system's benefit when it
was rented to DC for just $1?
You want to have conversations about fees? It was rented
for $1 to capitalize on the revenue potential, instead of the
money going to help make a dent in the $22 billion deferred
maintenance backlog. That could have easily been a valuable
revenue source to support the projects that you are requesting.
Mr. Sams. Thank you for the question, Congressman. When we
looked at this and spoke with the District of Columbia and
keeping it within the Federal family, we recognize that the
District has an opportunity to be able to really take over
jurisdiction, and shifting administrative responsibility to the
District so that they can actually see some better use of it.
Mr. Rosendale. And are they going to be collecting revenue
for the development of this 160-acre site?
Mr. Sams. That would be a question best asked to the
District than to me, sir.
Mr. Rosendale. So, sir, you are leasing them the ground for
$1. They are going to generate a development of 160 acres of
some of the most prime real estate in the country. And you
don't think that they are going to generate revenue, or didn't
think to ask are they going to generate revenue, and possibly
that some of that revenue should be going back to the taxpayers
so that we could utilize it for our park system?
Mr. Sams. Sir, it is Congress who will be leasing that to
them, at the direction----
Mr. Rosendale. Based upon the recommendation of the
National Park Service. So, we don't know about the revenue that
the District of Columbia is going to generate from 160 acres,
but we are very concerned about someone who is developing the
resources to help heat our homes and power our vehicles to push
freight across this country. And yet, on the other hand, we are
going to reduce the leases and the revenue that is generated by
renewables for the capacity and rental fees by 80 percent. But
the District of Columbia is going to make sure that they
collect and retain all of the revenue.
Director Stone-Manning, I hear you talk about the
transition to a clean energy economy. And while that may be
this Administration's goal, it is not the law, especially when
it comes to land use. And we continue to hear about the
manipulation of policy by rule change, not by law change, and
that is very problematic for most of the people that are
sitting in here. And quite frankly, it should be disturbing for
anybody, Republican or Democrat. We can't have rule changes
overriding what the law and the intent of the law was.
In your budget testimony, you emphasize the importance of
this funding for your clean energy projects. I am curious to
hear how covering a currently productive swath of land with
acres of glass for such an unreliable, intermittent use of
energy that meets your definition of conservation, especially
when compared to the generation of work and management by
ranchers and farmers on that land.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, first of all, it is nice to
see somebody from Montana. I know we don't always agree, but
Montana pride rises above that, I hope.
I think I heard your question to ask----
Mr. Rosendale. How would you explain that covering over
hundreds of acres of land with solar panels meets your
definition of conservation.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Yes, thank you for the question. It is
why we are working on the Western Solar Plan as we speak, so
that we make sure that we, because it is still development, it
is carbon pollution free, but it is still development, that we
drive that development to the most appropriate places on the
landscape as possible, just like we drive all of our
development to the most appropriate landscape.
Mr. Rosendale. OK, so Montana coal producers allocate a
significant portion of their revenue annually to reclamation
projects. And I have been out on those projects, and they are
actually quantifiably and measurably more productive after they
have extracted their resources and then do the reclamation
efforts. Visiting any of these sites would reveal no trace of
past mining activity.
Why is this practice, which involves productive use
followed by restoration to its original state, more productive,
again, not considered land conservation?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, the concern, of course,
with that work is the coal that is burned, right? It is not
about the landscape that is reclaimed after the coal is dug up.
The concern is about driving our economy towards a clean energy
economy.
Mr. Rosendale. And, again, we continue to hear about going
to a clean energy economy. But, again, we are superseding the
law, and the intent of the law, and the Taylor Grazing Act, and
the use of those lands by abusing the rulemaking process.
Mr. Chair, thank you so much for my time. I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields, and I will recognize the
Ranking Member, Mr. Neguse, for his questions.
Mr. Neguse. Thank you, Director Stone-Manning and Director
Sams, for your testimony and for indulging the Committee here.
And I know that it has been a robust hearing thus far, and I
suspect that will continue.
Director Sams, I really wanted to ask you a series of
questions. Before I do so, I will just take one moment to again
thank Director Stone-Manning, your agency, for the steps that
you took to protect the Thompson Divide. And, of course, as you
know, we are very much engaged in an effort here in the
Congress to make those protections permanent through the CORE
Act, which myself and Senators Bennet and Hickenlooper have
introduced. And it has variations. Iterative versions of it
have passed the House multiple times in the last several years.
Our hope springs eternal that we will be able to get that
across the finish line.
But in the interim, the protections afforded to the
Thompson Divide by virtue of your agency's decision are
incredibly important to the folks in Colorado, and I just want
to express my gratitude to the agency for taking that step. To
the extent you would like to expound on that, I am happy to
give you an opportunity.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Thank you, Congressman. I just wanted to
say that the thanks there goes to the leadership of Secretary
Haaland.
Mr. Neguse. Director Sams, I want to also say thank you for
the work that you do and the National Park Service does every
day. Of course, as you know, Rocky Mountain National Park in my
district is considered a crown jewel of the NPS system, and I
am grateful for the partnership that we have with folks there.
I want to talk a bit about wildland firefighting. As you
know, we have raised this issue at prior hearings with respect
to the challenges that our wildland firefighters are facing in
terms of government housing rates. And we sent a letter, myself
and a number of my colleagues, on a bipartisan basis to both
you and Chief Moore earlier this year. I received your
response, or a response that was sent on behalf of your agency,
last month.
What I am hoping you can kind of help me understand is, I
recognize that the NPS has certain constraints that you all are
operating under, particularly as it relates to OMB's circular
guidance. But clearly, that guidance, as it is being
implemented and interpreted today, is having disastrous impacts
for Federal wildland firefighters who are facing exorbitant
rent increases. And I am wondering what conversations you have
had with your colleagues at OMB about necessary changes that
should be made to the circular that would still comport with
Federal law, but would enable your agency to address what is
clearly an emerging crisis.
Mr. Sams. Congressman, thank you for the question.
I started out my career as a wildlands firefighter. My son
is currently a wildlands firefighter for the Oregon Department
of Forestry. And housing, of course, is a critical issue for
any of our firefighters. And recognizing that we knew that
there were going to be rent increases this year, I have asked
for those to be extended out over a couple of years, and have
received permission to do so, and we are implementing that.
But that being said, we are working very closely in trying
to figure out exactly where the increases are happening in the
different markets, how can we balance those out, what other
authorities both the Secretary and I have to be able to try to
mitigate for those increases and develop more public-private
partnerships to expand our housing, and so that we can make it
more affordable for our firefighters and our frontline NPS
staff.
Mr. Neguse. Well, I would say I appreciate that, Director
Sams, and I would hope, with respect to the decision that you
just described with respect to extending the rent increases
over a period of years, that you could provide our office with
further clarity on that, because I was unaware of that, and
that would be something very important for us to be able to
communicate back, us, meaning collectively the Members who sent
that letter, to the constituents that we have heard from and
the Federal wildland firefighters that we have heard from.
I would also just say, while I am supportive of NPS and
DOI's efforts to increase their housing stock, as reflected in
the budget submission that you all have sent over this year,
just in full candor, I am going to personally apply a much more
discerning eye towards supporting any investments in increasing
the housing stock absent some direct communication from OMB,
from NPS, from DOI, from the relevant authorities that you all
would like to see some deviation, some new statutory authority
or change in the underlying organic statutes that would give
you the ability to address this problem.
Because you can imagine, I mean, if we just simply allocate
more dollars for you all to secure more housing and you all
then, by virtue of the 4-year periodic comparable rent analysis
that you do with this new housing, come back to us and to the
Federal wildland firefighters and say that the rent increase is
going to be sustained in out years because that is the way the
market is functioning, we haven't really addressed that
fundamental problem.
So, I would implore you to let us know what we can do on
the statutory side. I happen to think, having reviewed the OMB
circular, that the Administration can take a variety of
different steps that would give you some flexibility, which it
sounds like they may have already done, because in the letter
that we got from the NPS, and I appreciate very much the
Chairman's indulgence, it said here, I will just quote from
you, from this letter, ``The NPS does not set its own rents,
nor does it have the authority to disregard rental
implementation requirements to pause or to reverse rental
changes.'' This is from, I forget the name of the gentleman
within your agency, one of the assistants, well, I don't know
the right title here, but in any event, that is very different
from what you just described. So, my point here is, I do think
there is room in the OMB circular. And if it requires us
advocating for the same, we are happy to do that.
Again, I thank the Chairman for his indulgence.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields. I will now recognize the
gentleman from Utah.
Mr. Curtis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member. I
would like to start with my comments directed to Director Sams,
but they also apply to the BLM, as well.
And I know this will shock you, I want to give you a
compliment, both of you, and just say that over and over again
I hear positive feedback about members that work for both BLM
and National Park Service on the ground in Utah. And we
certainly have our differences with both your agencies,
particularly as it relates to the Washington, DC side, but I am
constantly told how helpful the people are on the ground.
And I want to bring up a specific case, Director Sams. I
have in my hand a letter, and I would like to ask that it be
submitted for the record, from Katherine Hammond, Regional
Director of Glen Canyon National Parks, talking about working
with a group of people, our houseboat owners on Lake Powell.
And I know that they have had a number of internal meetings and
external meetings with these houseboat owners to build a good
relationship, and I just want to tell you they are doing a good
job, and how helpful that is to me when they work to build
these good relationships, and how much that is appreciated back
in the district.
Mr. Tiffany. Without objection.

United States Department of the Interior

NATIONAL PARK SERVICE

INTERIOR REGIONS 6,7, & 8

Denver, Colorado

Hon. John Curtis
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, DC 20515

April 30, 2024

Dear Representative Curtis:

Thank you for your letter on October 18, 2023, regarding Glen
Canyon National Recreation Area. The director has asked me to respond.

I wish to convey my thanks to your office for facilitating a
meeting on December 19, 2023, between Glen Canyon NRA staff and the
Lake Powell Houseboat Association, represented by Bennett Group DC, to
better understand the request for the establishment of a Lake Powell
Recreation Advisory Committee as requested in your letter. Your staff
member Jake Bornstein was instrumental in facilitating this meeting.

During the meeting, Glen Canyon NRA Superintendent Michelle Kerns
provided updates on the progress to restore access at Lake Powell and
the 2023 Disaster Supplemental funding that will be invested at Glen
Canyon to preserve recreational opportunities. The Houseboat
Association president and Superintendent Kerns have agreed to meet
quarterly to share information and progress. The Houseboat Association
has agreed that this local approach will lead to a successful,
collaborative working relationship with Glen Canyon NRA.

Thank you for your support of our parks and working to ensure the
best outcomes for our stakeholders. If you have any questions, please
contact Superintendent Kerns.

Sincerely,

Kate Hammond,
Regional Director

______

Mr. Curtis. Thank you. And that is Superintendent Kearns.
Superintendent Pace has been recently selected to lead the
Canyonlands and Arches National Park area. And as you know, in
my district, there are few districts like mine in the entire
country, with two national parks and the beautiful areas that
we have. It is part of Bears Ears and other areas.
When she was first appointed, she came to my office and met
me. We established a great relationship, and I just wanted to
give her a shout out, as well, and I appreciate that
relationship. She has a very hard task because our national
parks in Utah are being what we call loved to death. And there
is a tremendous pressure to put a reservation system in, and
they have experimented with several reservation systems. And we
would just like to ask you to be personally involved in that,
because if we get it right there is a lot of good. And if we
get it wrong, it can really be a detriment to the economy of
the area. And just making sure that we work with our local
stakeholders to make sure we get it right is very important.
So, I appreciate that and wanted to bring that up.
Also, Director Stone-Manning, part of my district is Bears
Ears, and we constantly, of course, as you know, have a very
difficult issue going back and forth between administrations on
the actual use of this land. But the theme that does not change
as we go back and forth between administrations is lack of
resources. At the very least, it is probably 1.3 million acres,
and we just don't have the people on the ground to manage 1.3
million acres, and the people that are coming to see the
antiquities and things like that.
So, we would like to continue to emphasize the fact that we
need more resources in the area to manage this land, regardless
of where we end up on the designation. It just needs more
resources, and we would love to have your help with that.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, thank you. And given this
is a budget hearing, we would welcome the help. Don't let me
stop you.
Mr. Curtis. Well, it is priorities, right? It is
priorities. And it feels like, to those of us in that area,
that this has not been a priority. This is 1.3 million acres.
And I think the number, if I am not mistaken, is two, maybe
four law enforcement BLM agents to manage 1.3 million acres.
You can see the impossibility of that problem for them.
And Director, you won't be surprised that the BLM
conservation rule is hugely problematic in my district. I
hardly have an opportunity to speak here where I don't bring up
the fact that 90 percent of these counties are Federal land, 90
percent. And the fact that there can be arbitrary decisions
thousands of miles away that impact grazing and recreation and
other uses on the land without appropriate input. There was not
a single hearing in Utah on this rule, not a single one. The
people of Utah had no opportunity to express in person their
concerns, and I just want to speak for them today to say they
are very frustrated. They are very concerned with this ruling.
And as you know, I am sponsoring the WEST Act to repeal
that, and would love to have conversations with your
organization about the end goal. We actually share the same end
goal. We all want to preserve and protect and make sure this
land is there for our grandchildren. But how we get there and
who gets to make those decisions is incredibly frustrating to
my district.
And I have used all my time, so you don't get a chance to
respond, but I think I have made my point.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields, and I will recognize Ms.
Leger Fernandez for 5 minutes.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you very much. And thank you,
Director Stone-Manning, Director Sams, and Comptroller Brown
for being here today. Thank you very much, actually, for the
hard work that you have put in that I think this paper
recognizes.
I want to see this as the thousands of public comments that
you have received, the careful study of how do we protect our
public lands and our public resources, because we must remember
those are American resources. They belong to us. And in order
to figure out how to best go along, protecting them, ensuring
that we receive the royalties that are due us, that we protect
it for those future generations, that we honor the creation
that they reflect for those who hold those places sacred,
whether from a Christian perspective, a Catholic perspective,
or an Indigenous perspective, it takes time, and I know you
have done that. So, I want to start by thanking you for that
work.
In particular, with regards to the onshore oil and gas
leasing rule, royalties make up a really important part of my
state's budget. As you know, we have a lot of public lands, we
have a lot of Federal lands. And we benefit from those oil and
gas royalties. Can you describe how drafting the final onshore
oil and gas leasing rule, how did you make sure you coordinated
with the public? That is, the people who actually own these
natural resources, as well as the oil and gas companies who are
making record profits right at this time.
Can you share a little bit about the coordination and the
input you received from both sides?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congresswoman, thank you so much for the
question.
And, of course, so much in the oil and gas rule that you
see before you is implementing what Congress asked us to do
through the Inflation Reduction Act with the increases of
royalty rates.
But we held many public meetings, both in person and
virtually. We got over 200,000 comments on the rule that we
pored over. And the final product is a result of what we heard
both from Congress and what we heard from the public.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you very much. And as you can
see, 200,000 comments takes up a lot of space.
I want to really make sure that we get to an issue that was
sort of big picture. I want to get to a little hyper-local
issue that I think affects other places, as well: the Valles
Caldera National Park and the Santa Fe National Forest. As you
know, Director Sams, there has been a significant number of
cattle that are routinely found in the park. I get a lot of
texts and comments about that. In fact, you are going to be
hiring wranglers for the next 6 months, every day, to gather
the cattle up.
As you know, in the state of New Mexico, we are a fence-out
state, meaning landowners are responsible for fencing out
livestock if they don't want them on their property. While I
know you are not subject to those Federal laws, it is a
tradition, and it is important to make sure that we do the
maintenance ahead so you do not have to have 6 months of
wranglers in the park, and that we can preserve the resources
of the park.
Can you actually commit to maintaining the portions of the
Valles Caldera fence within the Park Service's jurisdiction,
and let me know what steps you are going to be taking to
address challenges or barriers to ensure the proper upkeep of
this very important asset?
Mr. Sams. Thank you, Congresswoman, for the question. I
come from a ranching family. I understand the importance of
being accountable for your own cattle and/or horses. We ran
over 300 head of cattle and 100 head of horses.
That being said, and recognizing the issues that we face at
Valles Caldera, we are working very closely with the U.S.
Forest Service on a management plan for that. We are looking at
how exactly we can continue to build the fence out, and then
the responsibilities each of us will have on maintaining that
fence. I am happy to get that information and more specifics on
that back to you directly in writing.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you. And I think this need to
coordinate with all kinds of different agencies and
jurisdictions, including the ranchers, including the Forest
Service, making sure that what we are looking at is bringing
back both on Forest Service land the health of the grazing
lands, and then keeping those fences up. Good fences make good
neighbors.
With that, I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentlelady yields, and I would just
mention that those are not comments.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. But they reflect the comments.
Mr. Tiffany. Those are the new rules that have been
proposed by the Bureau of Land Management during the Biden
administration.
Ms. Leger Fernandez. Thank you. I was just pointing out
that I am sure that they reflect the comments that they have
received, the 200,000 on just one rule. So, thank you very much
for the clarification, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Tiffany. I would now like to recognize the gentleman
from Georgia for 5 minutes, Mr. Collins.
Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Director Stone-Manning, during a May 1 hearing before the
Full Committee, Secretary Haaland testified that since
President Biden has been in office, since January 2021, we have
approved mining or mining modification permits since the
President has been in office. That includes five critical
mines. Of these five mines that have been permitted under this
Administration, how many are critical minerals?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, thanks for the question.
Again, it is roughly 40 mines, 5 of which are critical
minerals, a couple of lithium, barium, zinc.
Mr. Collins. How many of them were permitted from start to
finish under this Administration?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, I would have to get back to
you on that question. I know the vanadium mine was start to
finish, but I would have to get back to you on that question.
Mr. Collins. How many received EISs under the previous
administration?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Again, I would have to get back to you.
I know that the lithium mine, Thacker Pass, the EIS was under
the previous administration. We did the notice to proceed.
Mr. Collins. How many mine or mine modification permits has
Interior denied under this Administration?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, I don't know the answer to
that question. I don't know of one that we have denied.
Mr. Collins. Do you know how many are awaiting an EIS?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Yes, I just asked for that number, and I
think it is 90. But I will get back to you.
Mr. Collins. How many are awaiting a record of decision?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Well, the record of decision comes after
the EIS.
Mr. Collins. So, that is still 90?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Yes.
Mr. Collins. OK, do me a favor. You said you are going to
get back in touch with us. Can you make sure that you do by the
end of this month, May?
Ms. Stone-Manning. I am happy to get you that information.
Mr. Collins. All right, thank you.
Also, Amos Hochstein, the Special Presidential Coordinator
for Global Infrastructure and Energy Security, said that we
don't have a lot of new supply of copper coming on-line around
the world. And what concerns me is, even when a discovery is
made, it could take between 7 and 15 years before the first
copper comes out. Now, that was his quote. Do you share those
concerns regarding copper supply?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, I don't know about the
global market supply of copper. I do know that when a proposal
comes before us, we dig in. We spend, on average, 5 years on a
hard rock mine EIS.
Mr. Collins. What, if anything, are you all doing to
expedite your reviews to ensure that we don't run out of the
supply, since the deposits that are active right now, they are
being depleted.
Ms. Stone-Manning. As I think you know, we worked with the
Interagency Working Group on Critical Minerals to identify how
we can get more efficient in our work. Congress, of course, I
think can play a role in that, but we are diving into the
report and working hard to turn those around.
And, again, an EIS, on average, for a hard rock mine is
somewhere between 4 and 5 years.
Mr. Collins. All right, thank you. I tell you what, I am
going to yield back to the fellow hiding behind the large stack
of rules. I think it is our Chairman back there.
Ms. Stone-Manning. If I might add one thing, we, of course,
are going to follow the Fiscal Reform Act that now tells us to
get those EISs done in 2.
Mr. Collins. All right.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields.
Director Stone-Manning, I am assuming when you do the so-
called renewable projects, you do a NEPA analysis, is that
correct?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Yes, Congressman.
Mr. Tiffany. As part of that NEPA analysis, do the people
that conduct it, do they evaluate how many endangered species
are going to be killed as a result of those so-called renewable
projects?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, we work closely with the
Fish and Wildlife Service when section 7 is implicated.
Mr. Tiffany. Yes. Isn't it accurate that we see a lot of
deaths of eagles and other endangered species as a result of
especially the wind turbines, and actually the solar panels
also?
Because was it the Ivanpah project out in California, I
might not have said it right, it is over a decade old, that
they referred to the birds as flamers when they went through
the solar array because they were torched. Will there be a full
analysis of the number of endangered species that are going to
be killed as a result of building these projects?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, we work every day with the
Fish and Wildlife Service as we do our permitting work to
ensure that we are complying with the Endangered Species Act.
Mr. Tiffany. Yes, does that concern you that we see the
number of deaths of endangered species with these so-called
renewable projects?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, the biodiversity crisis
facing our planet concerns me every day.
Mr. Tiffany. I would like to now recognize the gentlelady
from Wyoming.
Oh, I am sorry, the gentleman from Washington, Mr.
Newhouse.
Mr. Newhouse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know it is
difficult, you can't see us from up there, but thanks for the
opportunity to join on the Committee today for this important
hearing.
I also want to welcome our panelists this morning. Thank
you both for being here.
Director Sams, it is good to see you again, and I have to
say it is good to have a fellow Pacific Northwesterner in a
position of national responsibility. So, good to see you.
I want to focus the Committee's attention on something that
is of huge concern that is happening in my district. The
National Park Service, in conjunction with the Fish and
Wildlife Service, recently decided, and I might add against the
will of the majority of my constituents, that they will be
introducing grizzly bears into my district. You heard me
correctly. Grizzly bears. The Federal Government has finalized
a plan to airdrop these bears into the North Cascades
ecosystem.
So, Director Sams, quickly, could you tell us how does
airdropping apex predators into the NCE fit with the National
Park Service's mission of preserving the natural and cultural
resources of the National Park System?
Mr. Sams. Thank you, Congressman. It is nice to see you
again, and I appreciate our work in the past and I look forward
to continuing our work in the future.
The National Park Service is directly responsible for
implementing the Organic Act, and the Fish and Wildlife
Service, of course, is responsible for implementing the
Endangered Species Act. These laws require the agencies to
recover, protect, and preserve threatened and endangered
species as a public trust to ensure future generations benefit
from the same wildlife resources that we enjoy today.
Restoring a population of the North Cascades would help
advance the recovery of the species currently listed as
threatened in the Lower 48.
Mr. Newhouse. I might point out that grizzly bears, as you
know, have not existed in this ecosystem for decades. So, the
NPS truly is not preserving a grizzly park, nor does it support
the NPS's goal.
And I found this on your website in the About Us section,
your goal of creating close-to-home opportunities for kids and
families to get outside, be active, and have fun. I just have
to say that it is a little too close to home for my
constituents, and certainly is not going to be fun.
In reviewing the President's proposed NPS budget for Fiscal
Year 2025, I noticed that it proposes $194,000 for one FTE to
function as a cultural liaison for Indigenous communities at
the North Cascades National Park, Lake Chelan, and Ross Lake
National Recreation Area. Now, I assume that this includes
danger pay, as you also stated in your testimony the most
valuable resource the NPS has are its employees.
However, I did not see a justification to support the
translocation of grizzly bears from their existing ecosystem
into the district, nor did I see any educational campaign or
public outreach to inform my constituents, the people that live
up there, and visitors who come to the area that they must be
aware of grizzly bears.
Could you tell us how much your agency is allocating to
activities surrounding the establishment of the bears in the
NCE, including the protection of your employees and the
inhabitants?
Mr. Sams. Thank you for the question, Congressman. As you
know, we had this discussion. My people have lived with grizzly
bears for 10,000 years, and their demise has only been in less
than the last 70 years, really, in that effort.
And looking at it, we know that we have been able to manage
them as a species in the National Park Service, whether that be
at Yellowstone or Grand Tetons. As a matter of fact, my own
family experienced them one night when a ranger came by to tell
us a mama bear grizzly and her cubs were coming through, and we
woke up and made sure that we were protected. And then, as soon
as they made their way through, we went back and went to sleep
with no problem out in the woods.
To your specific question, I am going to defer to my
colleague here to talk a little bit more about the funding
process, but I can tell you we are committed to providing
education in the community, and we are working very closely
with Washington's Fish and Wildlife staff, too.
Ms. Bowron. I think, in addition to the specific funding
that is proposed as a programmatic increase for North Cascades,
there is also more than $100 million proposed to restore the
capacity that is lost in Fiscal Year 2024 across every park and
every program, so that the parks aren't absorbing that lost
purchasing power and they have additional funding to serve
visitors and protect resources.
Mr. Newhouse. OK. When your agency coordinated with the
Fish and Wildlife Service to follow through with this, what I
saw as a pre-determined plan to bring the bears into the area,
was the safety of your Park Service agents and the people who
surround this ecosystem of consideration?
Was their safety ignored, just like my constituents believe
that their concerns were, because the Federal Government knows
best?
I also want to ask, did the NPS consult with other Federal
agencies besides Fish and Wildlife Service?
Mr. Sams. Thank you, Congressman. I will have to go back
about all the other agencies we may have spoken with along with
Fish and Wildlife.
But yes, we have a very robust training program about
safety and working in and around apex predators, whether that
be grizzly bears, wolves, or mountain lions, and such. And we
will ensure that we provide that also to the general public
when they actually intermingle or may have a chance in back
country of coming across such apex predators.
Mr. Newhouse. Let me let you know that I asked the Acting
Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection if he was aware
of this new threat, because they have agents up in that area,
CBP agents, operating the northern border. And surprisingly, he
was not aware.
I just have to say that the example of this in my district,
it is certainly not the first or probably won't be the last
time the Federal Government, in my view, overstepped its
bounds, particularly when it comes to endangered and threatened
species.
The people's concerns up there are valid. I think they need
to be listened to. And I think, with all the discussion that we
have had this morning about other issues that are facing the
Park Service, I believe that this money could be going to real
issues that the Service is facing, such as the wildfires, which
you brought up, the housing issues, the shortages, the road
repairs. But instead, it is going to be going to this purpose
that I think is going to appease a lot of outside environmental
organizations.
It is my job to ensure that the voice of the people of
central Washington are heard, and I want to let you know that
the majority of the people in this area staunchly oppose apex
predators being airdropped, literally airdropped, into their
backyards using their own tax dollars.
So, I appreciate you being here, and I look forward to
continuing to work with you on this issue that is not going
away and we have to solve.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize for going over time.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the
gentleman from Texas for 5 minutes of questions.
Mr. Hunt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And thank you, ma'am, for being here, for your testimony. I
really appreciate you. I thank you all. I also want to thank
you for your support, actually, on the approval of the
Copperhead and Loving Pipeline project. This pipeline is an
essential project to our country's domestic supply of oil and
gas. It will further our energy independence and security, and
bring good-paying jobs to an economically deprived area.
And I want to take this opportunity to thank you for
supporting my bill, H.R. 7377, the Royalty Resiliency Act. This
common-sense fix will allow operators to pay the correct amount
of royalties up front, saving taxpaying dollars in the long
run, and alleviating the present honor accounting nightmare.
So, thank you for working with my office for that.
Moving on to the President's Fiscal Year 2025 budget
request, ma'am, President Biden's budget request includes
funding for an additional 104 full-time employees to your
agency. How many of these new full-time employees will work in
the Carlsbad, New Mexico BLM field office? Do you know, ma'am?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, I don't. I do know that we
are trying to tackle the vacancy issue in the Carlsbad office.
We have 115 FTEs working there now, and a table of organization
that allows for 170, and we are working hard on that.
But also, I am so proud of them for reaching record highs
on the number of permits to drill that they are getting out the
door despite those staffing shortages.
Mr. Hunt. OK. The Carlsbad office is the most active BLM
office in the entire country, as you just articulated. And in
2023 alone, the office received 2,500 APDs. And, unfortunately,
the office is only two-thirds staffed. So, while you commend
the workers that are putting out record output, we still have
quite a long ways to go, and I think we can accomplish that.
Earlier this year, I wrote to Ms. Melanie Barnes, then-
Staff Director of BLM in the New Mexico Staff office, to
inquire about this shortfall. And according to the response
that I received, the Carlsbad office still has a shortfall of
55 employees, several who are critical to the APD process and
approval of these agreements. So, we need to make sure that we
do continue to move forward and just get better and work
harder, because they are drastically behind.
And can you please commit to me today in good faith that
you will continue to communicate with my office on your efforts
to be proactive as possible, to make sure we get these numbers
back up and get a fully-staffed office in Carlsbad?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, I would commit that we will
keep you apprised.
Carlsbad is tough. Like so many places in the West, housing
costs are going through the roof, and it is hard to recruit.
But we are working on it every day.
Mr. Hunt. OK, thank you. I believe that given the
importance of BLM in New Mexico, the field office, that the
COVID-19 pandemic, it is over, it has been over. There are a
lot of people that are working from home still. So, when we
have shortages like this, and people working from home, and
COVID has been over for a very long time, I will also ask if
your office would commit to getting these people back to
working full-time to alleviate some of these numbers, as well,
if you don't mind.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, we are following department
policy on both telework and remote, and so many of those jobs
at the field level. The office is a car in the field, right?
And catching up on e-mails, either at home or at the office, is
a small part of the work. The work is really out on the ground.
Mr. Hunt. All right. Thank you very much, ma'am.
And lastly, just on Monday, I was in Midland, Texas. And
the reason why I was in Midland is because, I don't know if you
know, I am from Houston, Texas. Their entire energy corridor is
in my district. The two hubs for energy are in my district and
Congressman August Pfluger's district in Midland. So, there are
some synergies there that we are hypersensitive to and focused
on.
And I visited a company, and I have three applications here
with me. This is the first one. It is roughly seven pages. This
is Texas. This is also why Texas is growing so fast, because we
like to get things done in Texas.
The second one is the New Mexico one. This is 41 pages.
Better, but still not the Texas standard.
This is BLM's APD. This is 220 pages. And I am not trying
to be insulting, but this is why companies have a very hard
time when operating outside of Texas, and why America is
hurting, because we have to do better than this. This
disincentivizes companies to want to work hard to increase
their oil production that the world drastically needs.
Ma'am, I am asking you, can we please work together to get
this looking more like Texas in the not-so-distant future?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, I am very much interested
in results, and we are producing record highs off of our public
lands of oil.
And I heard you last week when you said to the Secretary,
``But I want more.'' I hear you.
Mr. Hunt. OK, good.
Ms. Stone-Manning. But we are producing record highs while
we are also upholding the law.
And as you know, a lot of our work is held up in court, and
I want to make sure that when we go to court, we win.
Mr. Hunt. But you do understand that whenever a company
sees this much bureaucracy, it does disincentivize them to try
to do more. Does that make sense?
Ms. Stone-Manning. I hear what you are saying, but please
also know that public lands are doing their part to fuel this
country.
Mr. Hunt. I understand. Thank you very much for being here.
Thank you for your cooperation.
I yield back my time. Thank you.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the
gentleman from Virginia for 5 minutes.
Mr. Good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Director Sams, where does public safety, the safety of
people, rank in terms of importance or priority in national
parks policy?
Mr. Sams. Thank you for the question, Congressman. It is
paramount to us.
Mr. Good. OK, great to hear. And how about the threat of
wildfires for communities near national parks?
Mr. Sams. Also very paramount to us.
Mr. Good. Great, glad to hear that. So, the Park Service
does have concerns if a community in a forested area would have
only one escape route in the event of a wildfire, you would be
concerned about that?.
Mr. Sams. We would be very concerned about that.
Mr. Good. Very good, glad to hear. As you know, last year
in Hawaii, a devastating wildfire broke out in Lahaina, and 115
people died because there were only two ways in and out of the
town, and people were actually trying to take refuge from the
flames. Five years ago, in November of 2018, the infamous
campfire broke out in California and resulted in 85 deaths,
representing the deadliest fire in California history. At least
seven of those deaths were attributed to people being trapped
in traffic jams, trying to escape. And then 7 years ago, in
2017, the Tubbs Fire ignited also in California, and led to a
6-lane highway being engulfed in flames, creating serious
evacuation issues that resulted in 22 fatalities.
My district is home to the Wintergreen community in Nelson
County in Virginia, which is located within the Blue Ridge
National Park, and it only has one method of entry and exit for
a community that has as many as 10,000 people at a time. For
over 30 years, the Wintergreen Property Association has tried
to obtain approval from the National Park Service to build a
400 foot long, 10-12 feet wide emergency gravel road to connect
the only road in Wintergreen to the Blue Ridge Parkway to
create an exit.
[Slide.]
Mr. Good. Actual photo here, you can see the orange part
there is the 400 feet that we need to be approved by National
Park Service to connect to the Blue Ridge Parkway, just the
little orange, 2 inch line there on my photo, anyway.
They have completed all the necessary studies confirming
that little to no negative environmental impact or threat to
endangered species would take place. But again, there is only
one means of entry and exit for Wintergreen. The whole
community is down here, and they can only go down. They can't
go up at this point, which, again, at any given time might have
as many as 10,000 people.
But the National Park Service has repeatedly indicated that
an emergency exit connecting the Blue Ridge Parkway across
National Park Service land to prevent the loss of life is
``likely inconsistent with the use of such lands for parkway
purposes,'' and then also cited the lack of precedent set forth
under the National Park Service Organic Act.
Wintergreen has, in response, proposed that the emergency
exit road would be under the control of National Park Service,
with a gate that would remain locked at all times for a gravel
road that would only ever be used, hopefully never, but only
ever be used in an emergency. And, again, the hope that that
would never be the case. But the NPS, National Park Service,
claims they have no authority to issue the permit under the
National Park Service Organic Act.
In December 2023, just now 5 months ago, the Wintergreen
community filed their latest application. They have been trying
for 30 years, thank God it hasn't been necessary yet, for an
emergency exit, which is pending review.
Again, you can see the diagram here. This would be a non-
invasive, gravel road, allowed to be grown over, again, gated
off, under the control of NPS, that would only be used in
emergency. Can you answer to why this has not been approved?
Mr. Sams. Thank you for the question, Congressman. I do not
know, but I will get back to you in writing about this, and
thank you for bringing it to my attention. I will look into it
more deeply.
Mr. Good. I appreciate that. It would be great if it could
just be approved, because that would be faster. Thank you for
your willingness to look at that. Both Senators in Virginia
have expressed their support for this to me, as they have
advocated for it, as well.
I do have a bill, the Blue Ridge Safety Act, which would
more clearly grant you the authority to issue one permit a year
in cases where there was an emergency. I would hope not to have
to wait for the legislative will to do that through both houses
of Congress and the President. It is a common-sense bill that
would allow Wintergreen to take these appropriate measures to
ensure their safety of the community.
So, thank you for your commitment to look at that, and
hopefully that you will support that, and hopefully, we will
never need to use it and it will just be grown over with gravel
underneath, and be very limited, but just a 400-foot access
road that would prevent loss of life unnecessarily. So, thank
you, Director Sams.
I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentleman yields. I now recognize the
gentlelady from Wyoming.
Ms. Hageman. All right, thank you.
Director Stone-Manning, I have visited the disaster on our
southern border three times. And there are millions of acres of
BLM lands in our southern border states such as New Mexico,
Arizona, California, Nevada, et cetera. How many times have you
visited the border states to find out firsthand how the
invasion of illegal aliens into our country has affected those
lands?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congresswoman, I have visited the border
once.
Ms. Hageman. OK. When was that?
Ms. Stone-Manning. That was in fall, late fall of 2021.
Ms. Hageman. You haven't been back?
Ms. Stone-Manning. To the border? No. To the southern
states, yes.
Ms. Hageman. OK. Have you, as the Director of the BLM,
undertaken any type of NEPA analysis to evaluate the
environmental impact of uncontrollable illegal aliens crossing
the border?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congresswoman, I think you might be
talking about the garbage that we were talking about earlier in
the hearing. Is that what you are referring to?
Ms. Hageman. No, I am talking about have you undertaken any
kind of an environmental analysis to determine the impact of
the horde of millions of people crossing that border illegally
and crossing BLM lands. Have you done any kind of an
environmental analysis to determine the impact that they are
having on our Federal lands?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Not to my knowledge.
Ms. Hageman. Does the BLM intend to start trying to find a
way to house illegal aliens on our Federal lands?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congresswoman, that is not in our
mission.
Ms. Hageman. Just 2 weeks ago, I had the opportunity to
question Secretary Haaland about various Wyoming priorities,
and one of which is the entire Wyoming Delegation has written
to you about multiple times, and that relates to the Rock
Springs RMP.
When I asked Secretary Haaland if she had heard about it,
or if she was familiar with it, she stated that she had not.
Director Stone-Manning, have you read the Rock Springs Resource
Management Plan?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congresswoman, I believe the next day
the Secretary, in a subsequent hearing----
Ms. Hageman. No, I am asking you. The question for you is,
have you read the Rock Springs RMP?
Ms. Stone-Manning. I have read the main chapters of it, but
not all the appendices.
Ms. Hageman. But you have not read all of it.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Not all the appendices, no.
Ms. Hageman. OK.
Ms. Stone-Manning. That is what my staff does.
Ms. Hageman. In that Rock Springs RMP, the BLM chose
alternative B, which would establish over 1.8 million acres as
areas of critical environmental concern, and it would impact
grazing, as well as oil and gas development, mining, and will
lead to the end of existing leases, where we have productive
uses that generate revenue for the state and for the nation. It
destroys recreation and vehicle access, and contains all sorts
of broad, so-called protections that aren't relevant to
protecting the environment at all.
In late 2023, a former BLM employee, who was actually a
participant in the drafting of the Rock Springs RMP, testified
to Wyoming's Joint Federal Natural Resources Management
Committee that the BLM preferred alternative received very
little time and effort in their development. In his own words,
he said, ``The science and the work was all done on alternative
D, as in dog. We sat down and in 1 week we did alternative B
and C together. And after that was done, we sat down with the
cooperating agencies and we spent the next 5 or 6 years
developing alternative D.''
Do you think it is appropriate to completely rewrite and
upend the management plan for 3.6 million acres of land, based
on a plan that was put together in 1 week?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congresswoman, I can't speak to a former
staffer at the BLM, but I can speak to the team in Rock Springs
who was working day in and day out on that plan, and I----
Ms. Hageman. They were working on the plan, but not on
alternatives B and C.
Ms. Stone-Manning. I am, as I was saying, I am proud of
their work, and I am proud of how they are incorporating what
they are hearing----
Ms. Hageman. Do you believe that a 1-week review would
comply with the requirements of FLPMA?
Ms. Stone-Manning. I am sorry, what was the question?
Ms. Hageman. Do you believe that a 1-week review of a
particular alternative for a Resource Management Plan that
would cover 3.6 million acres would satisfy the requirements of
FLPMA?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congresswoman, we are spending more than
a week on this plan.
Ms. Hageman. My question is, would a 1-week review for an
alternative on a plan that covers 3.6 million acres of land
satisfy the requirements of FLPMA?
Clearly, the answer is not, that it wouldn't, would it?
Ms. Stone-Manning. I believe it is a hypothetical question,
Congresswoman.
Ms. Hageman. In the first 3 years of the Biden
administration, the BLM held four onshore oil and gas lease
sales in Wyoming totaling 194,000 acres and generated $44
million in revenue. Conversely, the Trump administration held
13 lease sales over its first 3 years, leasing 2.2 million
acres and generating $431 million in revenue. The BLM has
brought in a tenth of the revenue, as compared to the Trump
administration. And as you know, half of that revenue goes to
the state of Wyoming, and half of it goes to the Federal
Government.
How do you intend to replace that kind of revenue into the
coffers of the Federal Government if you are going to deny our
ability to generate revenue on 48 percent of the surface estate
in the state of Wyoming?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congresswoman, there are 10 million
acres that are leased in this country that are not currently
being used. There are over 7,000 permits to drill that are not
being used.
Ms. Hageman. So, the answer is you don't have an answer to
that question.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congresswoman, we have 10 million acres
that are not being used that are leased. We have 7,000 permits
that are not being used that industry could use tomorrow. They
are choosing not to.
Ms. Hageman. You actually know so little about the industry
that you don't even know how that system and process works.
That is what is apparent by your answer to my question.
With that, I yield back.
Mr. Tiffany. The gentlelady yields.
So, Director Stone-Manning, the issue of FLPMA has come up
a couple of times. And you are familiar with the coordination
requirement in FLPMA, right?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Yes.
Mr. Tiffany. You know how it is much different than--we
hear the terms ``collaborate,'' things like that. Coordination
is much different, isn't it?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Our cooperating agencies help make our
work better.
Mr. Tiffany. But ``coordination,'' that term is clearly
defined, and is much different than, like, just cooperating or
collaborating. Isn't that correct?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, I don't think I know where
you are going with this question.
Mr. Tiffany. Well, I would go in this direction. We heard
from the gentleman from Guam how his constituents were not
heard, that they were not included in the process. He expressed
concern, and he was very mild about it and respectful, but it
was clear he was saying that on the issue he had in the Mariana
Islands, that they were not being heard.
We heard from the gentleman from Utah, not a single hearing
in regards to Bears Ears, is that correct?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, regarding the gentleman
from Guam, we don't manage lands on Guam.
And regarding the gentleman from Utah, we held public
meetings all over the West in capital cities that were easy to
get to. We also held meetings online virtually, so that people
can participate from their homes.
Mr. Tiffany. Did you coordinate with the local
municipalities?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, we work very closely with
the state of Utah.
Mr. Tiffany. You coordinated, treated them as an equal at
the table when you were doing the process? Is that what you are
saying? Because coordination is a very specific item within
FLPMA that--you must sit down and work with local governments,
local and state governments, as equals. Did you treat them as
equals?
Ms. Stone-Manning. I think he was referring to the Bears
Ears plan and the Grand Staircase plan, and we do work with
local entities to take their concerns into consideration.
On the public lands rule itself, we did that work with,
easily, 100 staffers at the Bureau whose job it is to implement
and manage on the ground every day.
Mr. Tiffany. Did you fully coordinate with the governing
entities in Utah, including local governments?
Ms. Stone-Manning. On the public lands rule? No, we did
not. They did have a chance between draft and final, however,
during a 90-day public period----
Mr. Tiffany. Thank you for letting us know that you did not
coordinate, because it is a different process than simply a
hearing.
I want to go to some testimony from Secretary Haaland from
a couple of weeks ago, and it had to do with the National
Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, their regulation. Didn't the
tribes up there ask for an extension on the provision that you
folks put in place? Didn't they ask for an extension, and
weren't they denied?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, we granted two extensions
in the public comment period for the NPRA rule.
Mr. Tiffany. So, the tribes are lying to us, saying that
they did not get the extension? Because that is what they told
us, they did not get an extension in a hearing here before the
Natural Resources Committee.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, I can't speak for the
tribes. What I can tell you is we extended the public comment
period twice.
Mr. Tiffany. A BLM employee said, ``I wish we could give an
extension. In other contexts, we might have that kind of time,
but I am happy to regale you with the ins and outs of the
Congressional Review Act. But, unfortunately, we are on a
schedule with this one that we don't have any control over. So,
we just don't have that kind of time for this rule,'' as a
result of denying the extension. Did you instruct your employee
to say that?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, I did not instruct that
colleague to say that. I can tell you that we met----
Mr. Tiffany. Is that employee still working for the Bureau
of Land Management after making a statement like that?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, she doesn't work for the
Bureau.
Mr. Tiffany. Did you issue any sort of directive in regards
to this, whether it was formal or informal, to say that we are
going to get you around the Congressional Review Act by doing
this in such a manner? Did you issue any directives?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, we worked very hard on this
rule and many others. And the timing is what the timing was. We
have worked for the last 2\1/2\ or 3 years on these rules, and
here we are.
And as you know, I don't know what the deadline is for the
Congressional Review Act, because it moves every year, right?
Mr. Tiffany. By the way, I was just handed a note. The
tribe asked for 90 days. They got 30.
So, we hear all this happy talk from the Administration,
and we heard it from you today also, in regards to we are so
serious about working with the tribal interests around the
country, we believe in Nation-to-Nation collaboration, and
things like that, but you didn't do that in Alaska. You didn't
take into account their request.
Does this Administration only work with the tribes when it
serves your interests and not necessarily the tribe's
interests?
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, I am so proud to work under
the historic leadership of Secretary Haaland. We engage with
tribes at the Department like we never have in our history. By
my count, we met with folks on the North Slope 17 times. Then
we had three public meetings on top of that. So, we listened
very hard to what they say. And the final rule that we
promulgated recently incorporates in part what we heard from
them.
Mr. Tiffany. And you would not give them the extension that
they wished for. A tribal interest in Alaska asked for a 90-day
extension, and the Bureau of Land Management did not give that
to them. Isn't that correct?
Ms. Stone-Manning. What we were able to do is continue in
government-to-government tribal consultation, which is not
dictated by a public comment period. The public comment period
shut down, but the government-to-government consultation
continued.
Mr. Tiffany. You have a long history of anti-natural
resource utilization in this country, both private and in
public. It certainly appears that you are continuing that in
your role as the Director at the Bureau of Land Management, and
it is terribly unfortunate for the American people that we
continue to see these types of actions that are leading to what
is harming the American people at this point, with inflation,
higher energy prices, the denial of energy projects, and the
anti-natural resources utilization mentality that exists with
this Administration. We see it all over the country. Americans
see it all over the country. And you can deny it if you wish
to. But that is not the case.
Ms. Stone-Manning. Congressman, what I am proud of is that
10,000 people who work for the BLM that I have the honor of
overseeing created $232 billion in economic output last year.
It is remarkable work.
Mr. Tiffany. And those 10,000 people are harming 300
million in the United States of America.
I would like to thank both the witnesses for your testimony
and Members for your questions.
Members of the Subcommittee may have some additional
questions for our witnesses today, and we will ask that the
