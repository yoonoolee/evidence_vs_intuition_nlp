SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Aviation
FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Aviation
RE:      LSubcommittee Hearing on ``FAA Reauthorization:
Securing the Future of General Aviation''
_______________________________________________________________________

I. PURPOSE

The Subcommittee on Aviation will meet on Thursday, March
9, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. ET in 2167 Rayburn House Office Building
for a hearing titled, ``FAA Reauthorization: Securing the
Future of General Aviation.'' The hearing will examine
challenges facing the general aviation community in advance of
Congress acting to reauthorize the Federal Aviation
Administration's (FAA) statutory authorities, which expire on
October 1, 2023. This year's FAA reauthorization bill is
expected to include the first-ever general aviation title for
which this hearing will provide an opportunity to hear from
stakeholders of the general aviation community on issues and
potential legislative solutions prior to the upcoming FAA
reauthorization bill. The Subcommittee will hear testimony from
witnesses representing the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association (AOPA), the Experimental Aircraft Association
(EAA), the American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE),
and the National Air Transportation Association (NATA).

II. BACKGROUND

According to the FAA, ``general aviation'' describes a
diverse range of aviation activities and includes all segments
of the aviation industry except commercial air carriers and the
military.\1\ General aviation activities include training of
new pilots and pilots interested in additional ratings or
certifications, aerial firefighting, air tourism, crop dusting
and surveying, movement of heavy loads by helicopter,
experimental and sport flying, flying for personal or business
reasons, and emergency medical services.\2\ General aviation
aircraft range from one-seat single-engine piston aircraft to
long-range corporate jets.\3\ It also includes rotorcraft,
gliders, and amateur-built aircraft.\4\

General aviation is commonly referred to as the backbone of
the aviation system as it underpins the aviation industry, and
is an important part of our National economy. According to a
2018 study, general aviation supported more than 1.2 million
jobs, generated $247 billion in output, and contributed $128
billion to the United States Gross Domestic Product.\5\

In terms of fleet size, ``the active general aviation
fleet, which showed a decline of 3.2 percent between 2019 and
2020, is projected to increase from its 2021 level of 204,405
aircraft to 208,905 by 2042,'' a 2.2 percent increase.\6\ The
FAA forecasts general aviation operations will increase an
average of 0.6 percent a year through 2042, as increases in the
use of turbine powered aircraft offset declines in piston
aircraft use.\7\ Specifically, ``general aviation operations
accounted for 57 percent of operations in 2021 . . . and has
been increasing since the pandemic, from 51 percent in 2019 to
56 percent in 2020, and 57 percent in 2021.'' \8\ Despite
forecasted operational growth, the FAA projects that the number
of general aviation pilots (excluding students and Airline
Transport Pilots) will remain flat between 2021 and 2042, at
around 306,400.\9\

FUNDING FOR GENERAL AVIATION AIRPORTS

A general aviation airport is a public-use airport that
does not have scheduled service or has scheduled service with
less than 2,500 annual passenger boardings.\10\ The current
National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) identifies
2,904 nonprimary airports that serve mainly general aviation
activity, accounting for approximately 90 percent of existing
NPIAS airports.\11\

narrative.pdf. [hereinafter NPIAS 2023-2027].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike commercial airports, general aviation airports do
not have access to the passenger facility charge (PFC), which
helps fund airport terminal and other capital projects at
commercial airports.\12\ However, general aviation airports
included in the NPIAS are eligible for Airport Improvement
Program (AIP) funds.\13\ General aviation airports are able to
receive funds through entitlements, or formula funds, to
airports, which can be used for eligible airport development
projects.\14\ Usually, general aviation, reliever, and
nonprimary commercial service airports are allocated 20 percent
of AIP funds, subject to apportionment.\15\ From that share,
those airports receive the lesser of either $150,000 or one-
fifth of the estimated five-year costs for airport development
for each airport as listed in the most recent NPIAS.\16\ Any
remaining funds are then distributed to each airport according
to a state-based population and area formula.\17\ General
aviation airports that receive entitlements can also apply for
discretionary funds, which are awarded on a competitive
basis.\18\

GENERAL AVIATION SAFETY

Over the past four decades, general aviation has become
significantly safer with the number of fatal and nonfatal
accidents declining since 2000.\19\ Experts suggest this is due
to numerous factors, including advancements in aircraft
equipment and technologies, improved pilot training, improved
education programs, and advocacy efforts across the general
aviation community.\20\ Preliminary general aviation safety
data shows the fatality rate per 100,000 flight hours has
steadily declined in the past few decades.\21\ The average
fatality rate from 2012 to 2020 was 1.07, while the preceding
decades were 1.29 and 1.49 respectively.\22\ Despite these
marked advancements, significant room for improvement remains.
General aviation has the highest aviation accident rates within
civil aviation. In 2012, the National Transportation Safety
Board (NSTB) found that general aviation accident rates were
about six times higher than small commuter and air taxi
operations and over 40 times higher than larger transport
category operations.\23\

of 2018 (P.L. 115-254), the FAA, in coordination with the NTSB,
conducted a study of all general aviation accidents from 2000
through 2018.\24\ The study showed there were 18,481 general
aviation accidents that involved 18,613 aircraft over that
period, resulting in 3,647 fatal accidents.\25\ When taking all
factors into consideration, the most common type of factors
analyzed by the FAA and NTSB relating to general aviation
accidents involved the pilot's control of the aircraft and

III. GENERAL AVIATION: ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION

DESIGNATED PILOT EXAMINERS

A designated pilot examiner (DPE) is an appointed
individual who is authorized to conduct the flight tests
necessary for issuing pilot certificates and ratings.\27\
Several general aviation operators and flight schools assert
there is a Nationwide shortage of the DPEs necessary to meet
the needs of student pilots and pilots seeking additional
certifications and ratings.\28\ Significant wait times to
schedule a check ride with a DPE can prolong an applicant's
training time and costs.\29\ A 2022 survey conducted by the
Flight School Association of North America found that 38
percent of 519 respondents reported that their wait was more
than a month to schedule an initial practical test.\30\

Regulations.\31\ From this review, a working group proposed 12
recommendations to improve the overall DPE system.\32\ In
response, the FAA accepted three recommendations, partially
accepted five recommendations, rejected two recommendations,
and noted that two recommendations were already implemented or
in progress.\33\ Several general aviation stakeholders were
party to the mandated review and some have encouraged the
Subcommittee to examine supply and demand of DPEs Nationwide.

TRANSITION TOWARDS AN UNLEADED FUTURE

According to the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine, ``nearly all the country's
approximately 170,000 active piston-engine aircraft burn a
grade of aviation gasoline (avgas), designated as `100LL,' that
contains lead.'' \34\ Avgas remains one of the only
transportation fuels in the United States to contain lead, with
more than 222,600 registered piston-engine aircraft that can
operate on leaded avgas.\35\ This leaded fuel contains tetra-
ethyl-lead, which is an additive used to prevent engine damage
at higher power settings.\36\ Because 100LL can be used by all
kinds of piston-engine aircraft, this single grade is the only
type of fuel consistently available for general aviation
operations and is the only FAA-certified fuel for use by these
aircraft.\37\ Although the FAA does not have direct regulatory
responsibility for aviation fuels, it provides the initial
certification approval of the aircraft with the fuel it
operates on, and it oversees aircraft operators to ensure use
of the correct fuel.\38\

aviation lead problem, and therefore a multi-pathway mitigation
approach offers the greatest potential for tangible and
sustained progress.'' \40\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In February 2022, the FAA, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), fuel suppliers and distributors, airports, and
engine and aircraft manufacturers announced the Eliminate
Aviation Gasoline Lead Emissions (EAGLE) Initiative--a
collaborative initiative to permit both new and existing
general aviation aircraft to operate lead-free, without
compromising aviation safety and the economic and broader
public benefits of general aviation.\41\ Specifically, the
initiative seeks to (1) establish the necessary infrastructure,
efficient distribution channels, and widespread usage of
unleaded fuels; (2) support research and testing of piston
engine modifications and/or engine retrofits necessary for
unleaded fuel operations; and (3) address fleet-wide
authorization of unleaded aviation fuels of different octane
levels.\42\

\42\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
General aviation stakeholders, in coordination with the
FAA, are working to move the piston aviation fleet towards a
viable and safe unleaded future in an efficient and economical
manner. The EAGLE Initiative proposes to achieve the widely
held goal of eliminating lead emissions from general aviation
by 2030.\43\ As part of this effort, the FAA announced in
September 2022 it had granted a supplemental type certificate
(STC) approval for the first unleaded fuel for use in every
general aviation engine using spark-ignition; more are expected
to follow.\44\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
That said, some general aviation operators may be concerned
about the continued availability of avgas at airports until
unleaded alternative fuels are widely available to the piston
aviation fleet. Concerns pertaining to the larger effort to
remove lead from avgas include: (1) ensuring the reliable
production and distribution of unleaded alternative fuels once
approved; (2) educating general aviation pilots during the
transition to prevent misfuelling; and (3) ensuring the
installation of unleaded avgas storage and dispensing systems
at thousands of small airports across the country.\45\

AIRPORT & AIRSPACE ISSUES

AIRPORT FUNDING

As previously stated, since general aviation airports do
not have access to the PFC to fund airport terminal and other
capital projects, smaller airports are much more reliant on the
AIP to meet their capital needs. The current NPIAS estimates
that through 2027, there are $19 billion in AIP-eligible
development costs at nonprimary airports which are estimated to
service 58 percent of the active general aviation fleet.\46\
Meanwhile, contract authority for AIP has remained flat, at
$3.35 billion per year, for more than a decade. Moreover, there
are growing concerns that inflation and rising construction
costs continue to undermine the ability for general aviation
airports to complete cost-effective projects and threaten the
value these projects provide to the communities they serve.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\46\ NPIAS 2023-2027, supra note 11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Separately, there are nearly 2,000 public-use, general
aviation airports not eligible to receive Federal funding for
capital improvement projects.\47\ These airports are often
located in rural areas and potentially provide critical access
to the communities they serve. Many general aviation operators
and lawmakers are interested in ensuring continued air service
and airspace access through the maintenance and modernization
of infrastructure at all general aviation airports.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

FAA CONTRACT TOWER PROGRAM

The FAA Contract Tower (FCT) Program is a public-private
partnership that serves as an integral component of the air
traffic management system managing over 25 percent of the
Nation's air traffic control operations at towered
airports.\48\ The program currently provides for the contract
operation of air traffic control services at over 250 airports
in at least 46 states.\49\ General aviation operators and
airports continue to underscore the importance of the FCT
program and advocate for critical infrastructure upgrades to
ensure contract towers can continue to operate safely and
efficiently.

REMOTE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWERS

Technology could enable some airports to provide air
traffic services remotely. Remote air traffic control towers
propose to leverage cameras, microphones, meteorological
sensors, and other monitoring equipment to provide air traffic
control specialists with sufficient information to provide air
traffic control tower services.\50\ The controllers themselves
are located at facilities which receive real-time data and
video from these sensors and equipment.\51\ For some locations,
it has been proposed that the controllers would still be on-
site, using the remote capabilities to erect a cheaper mast
with sensors instead of a brick and mortar tower; at other
locations it has been proposed that the controllers could be
located off-site altogether. Regardless, the controller at the
remote location would provide air traffic services to the
airport the same way he or she would in a normal tower.\52\ The
FAA is currently exploring using this technology at airports
located in rural and remote areas, possibly improving safety
and increasing access to the National Airspace System (NAS).

WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

AVIATION WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GRANTS

Section 625 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018
authorized five million dollars for a pilot workforce
development program and five million dollars for an aviation
maintenance technician workforce development program.\53\ This
workforce development program has enjoyed broad support from
many general aviation stakeholders as it encourages
collaboration between government, industry, and local entities
to address skills gaps and encourage more Americans to pursue
good-paying careers in aviation. Several stakeholders are
concerned that the program is oversubscribed, with the FAA
receiving hundreds of grant applications in the initial funding
round, but only able to award 30 workforce development grants.
Many general aviation stakeholders have expressed interest in
continuing and potentially expanding this program in the next
FAA reauthorization bill.

NATIONAL CENTER FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF AVIATION

A proposal to establish a ``National Center for the
Advancement of Aviation'' (NCAA) is supported by a broad
coalition of general aviation stakeholders, who believe that
such a center would improve government and aviation industry
collaboration on programs to enhance the United States aviation
workforce and help maintain United States global leadership in
aviation.\54\ In the 117th Congress, the House passed H.R.
3482, a bill to establish the NCAA, a federally-chartered,
independent entity focused that would promote aviation
workforce development and aviation education.\55\ The NCAA
would fund scholarships, apprenticeships, aviation curriculum
development, and other outreach efforts to encourage students
to pursue careers in aviation. It would also launch initiatives
to assist military personnel and veterans seeking a career in
civil aviation. Furthermore, the NCAA would serve as a central
repository for universities, industry, and other institutions
to share information on workforce development and skills
training. Many stakeholders have requested that the
Subcommittee include the authorization for the NCAA in the 2023
FAA reauthorization bill.

OTHER ISSUES

In addition to the issues discussed above, the following
subjects may also be raised at the hearing:

LAircraft Registry Backlog: Several general
aviation aircraft owners have been negatively affected by the
aircraft registry backlog which has resulted in aircraft owners
waiting upwards of six months to register, or re-register,
their aircraft with the FAA.\56\ As of February 20, 2023, the
FAA's registry office was still processing some documents
received on October 6, 2022.\57\ Although the FAA's recently
promulgated rule extending aircraft registration to seven years
(up from three years) is expected to provide relief to the
backlog, many lawmakers and general aviation stakeholders
remain concerned about the Agency's ability to address the
backlog in a timely manner.

FAA REAUTHORIZATION: SECURING THE FUTURE OF GENERAL AVIATION

----------

THURSDAY, MARCH 9, 2023

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Aviation,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:02 a.m. in
room 2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Garret Graves
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. The subcommittee will come to
order.
I want to start out this morning, and I want to
congratulate and welcome my good friend, Steve Cohen, as
ranking member. I often remind him that he used to represent my
sister, who then moved to an adjacent district to get better
representation.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. No, seriously, Congressman Cohen
and I have had the opportunity to work together on a number of
initiatives and travel together over the years, and he is a
good friend, and I am looking forward to working together with
you this year.
I ask unanimous consent that the chairman be authorized to
declare a recess at any time during today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that all Members not on the
subcommittee be permitted to sit with the subcommittee at
today's hearing and ask questions.
Without objection, so ordered.
As a reminder, if Members want to insert a document into
the record, please also email it to

I now recognize myself for 5 minutes for an opening
statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GARRET GRAVES OF LOUISIANA, CHAIRMAN,
SUBCOMMITTEE ON AVIATION

Mr. Graves of Louisiana. It is no secret that aviation is
at a pivotal moment in history. Advancements in technology and
innovation in aircraft design have not just made aviation or
air travel safer, but it has also lowered the threshold and
allowed more Americans than ever to be able to be given the
opportunity to experience flight. The aviation sector wouldn't
be where it is today without the general aviation sector.
Just last night I led a night tour, and I think I was in
the rotunda around midnight, looking up at the frieze over the
west front, the fresco or what have you that goes around the
rim of the rotunda. And it begins with a depiction of
Christopher Columbus coming off the boat and discovering the
New World, and it goes around, and it ends with the Wright
brothers' discovery of flight. And it is such an important part
of America's history that it is actually depicted right there
in the Capitol, in the rotunda.
To see how far we have come over that period of time is
remarkable. And what is even more exciting is that we have not
fallen flat, not even close. Advancements in innovation are
ushering in new users and use cases for the National Airspace
System, including eVTOL, or electric vertical takeoff and
landing aircraft, and drones.
I am excited to witness in real time the safe integration
of these new technologies, these new entrants. And I am excited
to learn more from our witnesses about how Congress can bridge
any gaps to achieve the shared goal of moving forward on
America's leadership in aviation.
We have the opportunity in the upcoming FAA bill to examine
the challenges the general aviation community faces and address
as many challenges as we can to put general aviation on a sound
footing for many, many years to come, and we need to capitalize
on this opportunity. I worry that kicking the can until the
next reauthorization bill will set back American global
leadership in aviation.
The time is now that we make smart investments in general
aviation. We also have to ensure that all areas of the Federal
Government are supporting our GA community.
I have been excited to work with our Livingston Parish
Airport District as they move forward to create a new GA
facility in our district.
But while the airport has received a commitment of funding
from our State and locals through COVID response, I do have to
say the Treasury Department has been a complete pain and given
us the Heisman for months and months as we try and get
confirmation on the eligible use of funds for support for
drainage mitigation and other uses for the airport.
GA facilities are an incredible asset in our district, and
I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Treasury
Department: Return our phone calls and emails, please.
I look forward to working with the full committee chairman
and members of the subcommittee in this effort.

refuse in the river and send it downstream, and it goes to
Baton Rouge.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Rodney Davis, Jr.
Mr. Cohen. I have never had the opportunity to sit next to
a former Governor, a present Governor, or a future Governor,
so, it is a great honor.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Cohen. That frieze he talked about, if they did it in
1969 or 1972, would have stopped with FedEx. So, it would have
continued on into aviation great moments.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. STEVE COHEN OF TENNESSEE, RANKING
MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON AVIATION

Mr. Cohen. As we kick off our first Aviation Subcommittee
hearing and continue our efforts to reauthorize the FAA, I
welcome this opportunity to discuss the challenges facing the
general aviation community.
As we have heard from our chairman of our subcommittee, and
we will hear from our chairman of our full committee, Mr.
Graves, our FAA reauthorization bill have the first-ever
general aviation title, and I look forward to hearing from our
witnesses on ways our committee can work with Mr. Graves the
first on these important issues.
General aviation is an important sector of our aviation
system, spanning from sport and recreational aviation to
medical transport to business travel to aerial firefighting and
more. According to the FAA, the United States has the largest
and most diverse general aviation community in the world with
more than the 220,000 active aircraft.
Moreover, general aviation supports over 1.2 million jobs
and is estimated to generate nearly $250 billion in economic
output.
It is encouraging that general aviation has become
significantly safer over the past four decades, with the number
of fatal and nonfatal accidents declining since 2000. When we
held our hearing on this topic in July of 2022, I appreciated
hearing from the National Transportation Safety Board, Chair
Jennifer Homendy. As she noted, however, the vast majority of
the NTSB's aviation investigations involve general aviation
accidents--this is because of the numbers, I guess--and the
subsequent new regulations derived from their recommendations
continue to contribute to improved aviation safety.
Since 2000, the NTSB has issued 294 safety recommendations
addressing issues related to noncommercial general aviation
operations. Of the 294 recommendations, 231 have been closed,
while 63 remain open.
As we will hear today, it is important that we all continue
to work together to maintain the positive trend in general
aviation and continue to increase safety for all of our general
aviation users.
I look forward to discussing ways in which we can continue
to work together to transition towards an unleaded future.
Aviation gasoline, or avgas, remains one of the only
transportation fuels in the United States that contains lead,
with more than 222,600 registered piston-engine aircraft that
can operate on this type of gas.
The use of leaded avgas continues to remain a significant
public health concern. It has been well documented by medical
institutions and the CDC that lead exposure in children can
lead to increased cognitive performance--decreased cognitive
performance--I must have had a little lead around me at some
time--and potentially lead to long-term learning and behavioral
problems. I certainly did have it.
In the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act, we directed the
National Academies of Science to study aviation gasoline and
how to transition away from it. In a 2021 report, the National
Academies noted that there is currently ``no [singular],
certain solution to the aviation lead problem, and therefore a
multipathway mitigation approach offers the greatest potential
for tangible and sustained progress.''
I applaud current efforts to research and develop
alternative fuels, such as the Eliminate Aviation Gasoline Lead
Emissions--or the acronym EAGLE--initiative and recognize it
will take a collaborative effort to move forward to a safe
transition towards unleaded fuel.
As we will hear today, there are several issues that need
our attention as we work on our next FAA reauthorization bill.
I look forward to working with the subcommittee, the full
committee, particularly with my friend Garret Graves, and
coming together with a bipartisan bill that helps America's
fliers, and passengers, and everybody connected to aviation.

Mr. Cohen. I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Cohen.
Our next opening statement, I am convinced--we were talking
about the Wright brothers--if this guy had been around, after I
spent a little time in Tarkio at his hangar, I am convinced
that the Wright brothers' timeframe would have been cut in
half, if he was involved in developing that plane.
I yield 5 minutes to the chairman of the full committee,
Sam Graves.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SAM GRAVES OF MISSOURI, CHAIRMAN,
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking
Member.
So, I think everybody has pretty much heard that I intend
to do in the next FAA reauthorization a GA title. It will be
the first time that we have done that. And I am looking forward
to doing the FAA reauthorization, I really am. We have got so
many challenges out there, whether it's workforce, or air
traffic control, or organization within the FAA, or some
certification issues. But regardless, I am looking forward to
it.
There are basically two tracks to get into the aviation
industry, whether that is a mechanic, or a pilot, even air
traffic control. You can come up through the military or you
can come up through general aviation. And my concern within
this committee's purview is, obviously, general aviation, and
it is the cornerstone of aviation.
Everybody that pursues a career in aviation starts out as a
GA pilot. That is just a fact. And they start out at that local
airfield. And there are challenges throughout that. We have to
make sure that we figure out how to break down those barriers
to get young people involved, and young people excited again.
And there are a lot of challenges out there, expense being one
of them. But it is incumbent upon us in general aviation to do
everything we can to encourage those young people to choose a
career in aviation, and that is something that we need to be
thinking about, and something that we need to do.
I have said many times before that one of the worst things
that happened when it comes to the FAA is when advocacy was
removed from the mission statement. And that is absolutely a
fact. We need more advocates within the FAA and throughout
aviation than we do so many other things, whether that's
inspectors, or enforcement, or whatever the case may be. We
have to be good advocates, and we have to get these young
people.
So, I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here. I
am looking forward to hearing the testimony and reading through
the testimony that has been provided. And this is our start to
FAA reauthorization. And again, we are going to put some
serious focus on the GA community, whether that's local
airfields or, again, pilot training. And our organizations that
represent general aviation are vital to that. And I appreciate
all the input that we have gotten from the stakeholders and
everybody from all of the organizations, and I, again, look
forward to the testimony.
[Mr. Graves of Missouri's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Sam Graves of Missouri, Chairman, Committee
on Transportation and Infrastructure
I'm looking forward to passing a bipartisan FAA reauthorization
this year, and I think most people know that I intend to include the
first ever general aviation (GA) title.
We've got so many challenges facing our aviation system--whether
it's the workforce shortage, air traffic control issues, or issues with
FAA's organization and certification processes. To address these
issues, we need a good pipeline of aviation professionals, and there
are basically two tracks to get into the aviation industry. People can
come up through the military or they can come up through general
aviation, and my concern within this Committee's purview is obviously
general aviation--which is the cornerstone of aviation.
So many who pursue a career in aviation start out as a GA pilot,
starting out at their local airfield. But there are challenges to that,
such as expense, and we have to make sure that we figure out how to
break down barriers to get young people involved and excited in
aviation again. It's incumbent upon us in general aviation to do
everything we can to encourage young people to choose a career in
aviation, and that's something we need to be thinking about in terms of
this reauthorization bill.
I've said many times before that one of the worst things that
happened with the FAA is when advocacy was removed from the mission
statement. Safety will always be fundamental to FAA, but we need more
advocates within the agency and throughout aviation, whether that's
inspectors, enforcement, or whatever the case may be. We have to be
good advocates and we have to get young people involved.
I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here. Here at the
start to the FAA reauthorization process, we're placing some serious
focus on the GA community, whether that's local airfields or pilot
training, and our organizations that represent general aviation are
vital to that.

Mr. Graves of Missouri. And thanks for allowing me the
time, Mr. Chairman. And with that I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I now
recognize the ranking member of the full committee, another
great friend.
And also, Mr. Larsen, I want to congratulate you for your
position, and I look forward to working with you on the FAA
bill this year.
I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Washington.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair Graves, and I
appreciate the opportunity.
And Ranking Member Cohen, thanks for calling the hearing
today on securing the future of general aviation.
So, in my home State of Washington and across the country,
general aviation means good-paying jobs, and it is part of the
key to long-term economic growth. A recent study found the GA
industry supported an estimated $247 billion in economic output
and 1.2 million jobs in the U.S. in 2018. It seems we maybe
want to update that now.
In terms of fleet size, the active GA fleet is projected to
increase from its 2021 level of more than 204,000 aircraft to
209,000 by 2042. This means more manufacturing, more
maintenance, and more flightcrew training will be needed,
resulting in opportunities for growth in communities with
general aviation airports. And that, of course, means investing
in the workforce and developing the future workforce in
aviation.
But first and foremost, we must continue to champion
aviation safety. Over the past few decades, general aviation
has become significantly safer, with the number of fatal and
nonfatal accidents declining since 2000. However, there is
still room for improvement in GA, which has the highest
aviation accident rate within civil aviation.
In 2021, the NTSB found that most aviation fatalities in
2020 took place during general aviation operations, where 332
people were killed; compared to zero fatal accidents involving
part 121 air carriers in that same year. I would note the
accident of the Mutiny Bay crash in my own district, killing 10
last year as an example of that. With new technologies
available for general aviation aircraft, the expansion of
analytical tools to study safety trends and patterns, and
improved training, we can, will, and, frankly, we should do
better.
As well, general aviation also improves equity and access
to the National Airspace System for people across the country.
Many small and rural communities do not have access to
commercial service airports or regularly scheduled air service.
For instance, 82 percent of communities in Alaska are only
accessible via air, yet only a handful have regularly scheduled
commercial flights. General aviation and charter services
provide these communities with lifelines to critical resources
and services.
To that end, Congress specifically targeted general
aviation in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, investing $500
million annually over 5 years for general aviation and
nonprimary airports and $300 million for contract towers,
creating jobs and increasing mobility. These types of
investments are critical to ensuring that NAS is available to
all people.
Unfortunately, as the NAS expands, we have to be cognizant
of consequences. And as the ranking member discussed already
with regards to leaded fuel, certain piston-powered general
aviation aircraft still use avgas, which contains lead. So,
while general aviation is the only transportation mode still
using leaded fuel, we have to ensure that transition to newly
available unleaded alternatives is safe and thoughtful.
To expedite this transition, the Eliminate Aviation
Gasoline Lead Emissions--or EAGLE--initiative was launched in
the last couple of years. This Federal and industry initiative
aims to transition GA completely to unleaded fuel by 2030.
And the general aviation sector is also committed to
addressing the industry's contributions to climate change. In
recent years, the development of electric and hybrid-powered
aircraft have been among the efforts to reduce carbon and noise
emissions. For example, Arlington Municipal Airport in my
hometown of Arlington, Washington, is home to Eviation, an
aviation company which is developing the nine-seat, all-
electric Alice aircraft. GA is also working to adopt
alternative fuel sources to reduce carbon emissions, such as
the development and distribution of SAF.
To support the sustainable growth of the general aviation
sector, Congress must create a regulatory framework that
prioritizes safety, invests in the necessary infrastructure,
and helps to make our communities globally competitive well
into the 2050s and beyond. So, while the future of U.S.
aviation remains bright, general aviation is part of that
picture, and still faces challenges that have to be addressed.
And we have that opportunity, working with the FAA
reauthorization, to work with GA to ensure that future remains
bright.
Finally, before I yield back, Mr. Chair, I do want to
recognize representatives from the Colgan family who are here
to continue their valiant and necessary effort to ensure
continued safety in the national airspace.
With that I look forward to tackling these issues together
with everyone here.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen of Washington, Ranking Member,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
Thank you, Chairman Graves, for calling today's FAA Reauthorization
hearing on ``Securing the Future of General Aviation.''
In my home state of Washington and across the country, general
aviation (GA) means well-paying jobs and is key to long-term economic
growth.
A recent study found the general aviation industry supported an
estimated $247 billion in economic output and 1.2 million jobs in the
U.S. in 2018.
In terms of fleet size, the active general aviation fleet, is
projected to increase from its 2021 level of more than 204,000 aircraft
to nearly 209,000 by 2042.
This means more manufacturing, maintenance and flight crew training
will be needed, resulting in additional opportunities for growth in
communities with general aviation airports.
First and foremost, we must continue to champion safety as our top
priority.
Over the past few decades, general aviation has become
significantly safer--with the number of fatal and nonfatal accidents
declining since 2000.
However, there is still significant room for improvement as general
aviation has the highest aviation accident rate within civil aviation.
In 2021, the National Transportation Safety Board (NSTB) found that
most aviation fatalities in 2020 took place during general aviation
operations, where 332 people were killed; compared to zero fatal
accidents involving Part 121 air carriers in that same year.
With new technologies available for general aviation aircraft, the
expansion of analytical tools to study safety trends and patterns, and
improved training, we can and will do better.
General aviation also improves equity and access to the National
Airspace System (NAS) for people across the country.
Many small and rural communities do not have access to commercial
service airports or regularly scheduled air service.
For instance, 82 percent of communities in Alaska are only
accessible via air; yet only a handful have regularly scheduled
commercial flights.
General aviation and charter services provide these communities
with lifelines to critical resources and services.
To that end, Congress specifically targeted general aviation in the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investing $500 million annually over 5
years for general aviation and non-primary airports and $300 million
for contract towers, creating jobs and increasing mobility.
These types of investments are critical to ensuring that the NAS is
available to all Americans.
Unfortunately, as the NAS expands, we must also be cognizant of its
consequences.
Certain piston-powered general aviation aircraft still use Avgas
which contains lead--a neurotoxin that can be particularly detrimental
to children.
While general aviation is the only transportation mode still using
leaded fuel, we must ensure the transition to newly available unleaded
alternatives is a safe and thoughtful one.
To expedite this transition, the Eliminate Aviation Gasoline Lead
Emissions (EAGLE) Initiative was launched in February 2022.
This federal and industry initiative aims to transition general
aviation completely to unleaded fuel by 2030.
The general aviation sector is also committed to addressing the
industry's contributions to climate change.
In recent years, the development of electric and hybrid-powered
aircraft have been among the efforts to reduce carbon and noise
emissions.
For example, Arlington Municipal Airport in my hometown of
Arlington, Washington, is home to Eviation, an aviation company which
is developing the nine-seat, all-electric ``Alice'' aircraft.
The general aviation industry is also working to adopt alternative
fuel sources to reduce carbon emissions, such as the development and
distribution of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
To support sustainable growth of the general aviation sector,
Congress must create a regulatory framework that prioritizes safety,
invests in the necessary infrastructure and helps to make communities
globally competitive well into the 2050s and beyond.
While the future of U.S. aviation remains bright, general aviation
still faces several challenges that must be addressed.
Today's witnesses will provide much needed insight on the
industry's priorities and how Congress can be a better partner in these
efforts.
Thank you, and I look forward to tackling these issues together.

Mr. Larsen of Washington. I yield back.
Mr. Yakym [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Larsen.
I would like to welcome our witnesses today and thank them
for being here.
Briefly, I would like to take a moment to explain how our
lighting system works to our witnesses. There are three lights
in front of you. Green means go; yellow means you are running
out of time; and red means wrap it up and conclude your
remarks.
I would ask unanimous consent that the witnesses' full
statements be included in the record.
And without objection, so ordered.
As your written testimony has been made a part of the
record, the subcommittee asks that you limit your oral remarks
to 5 minutes.
And with that, Mr. Baker, president and chief executive
officer of the Airline Owners and Pilots Association, you are
recognized for 5 minutes for your testimony.

TESTIMONY OF MARK BAKER, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,
AIRCRAFT OWNERS AND PILOTS ASSOCIATION

Mr. Baker. Thank you. Chairman Graves, Ranking Member
Cohen, members of the subcommittee, thank you for the
opportunity to provide the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association's perspective on how to secure general aviation's
future as you develop this year's FAA reauthorization.
First, let me thank the committee and the professional
staff for all the work and effort that goes into compiling such
an important, comprehensive bill that impacts every segment of
aviation. We are very appreciative, and encouraged that the
full committee Chairman Graves has announced his intention, for
the first time ever, to include in the title general aviation
for this year's FAA reauthorization. As a pilot himself, the
chairman fully recognizes the service and the contribution GA
brings to thousands of communities, and I am certain he hears
from private pilots every day.
General aviation faces many challenges today, including the
most significant: removing lead from aviation gasoline. The
entire industry and the FAA are working on this issue every
day, and we have made progress.
One thing I can report to the committee is that general
aviation has never been safer. With over 26 million flight-
hours transporting hundreds of millions of passengers,
including more than 30 million takeoffs and landings, last year
was the safest on record for general aviation, and this has
been a positive trend.
We also believe that, in order to maintain the safest
aviation system in the world, the committee should support
investments in modernizing systems that are core to FAA's
mission, whether it is ATC systems, the NOTAM system, the
aircraft registration systems, the pilot medical system, all of
which fall under the primary safety certification and
regulatory functions of the agency. In order to secure the
future of general aviation, the committee has an opportunity to
address many of these issues that will set the course for years
to come.
We have provided the committee with a list of priorities
and legislative concepts as a starting point. Many of these are
outlined in my written testimony. However, being respectful of
everyone's time, let me briefly address the following issues:
workforce development; the FAA's Designated Pilot Examiner
program; hangar construction; and transient ramp space at
public-use airports.
With respect to workforce development, I am very proud of
AOPA's award-winning, 4-year high school STEM aviation
curriculum, which we provide to high schools for free. Our
curriculum now is in more than 400 schools in 43 States. And
since the program's inception, we have reached more than 50,000
students, and more than 70 percent of those who have graduated
report they are actively pursuing a career in aviation.
And while we appreciate the committee's leadership in
addressing and investing in aviation workforce challenges, we
don't believe these issues will fall under the core mission of
FAA. We join the entire aviation industry in supporting the
establishment of the National Center for the Advancement of
Aviation, which this committee and the House passed with
Congress with nearly 400 votes. This center would allow the FAA
to refocus its core on safety missions and help create
effectiveness and efficiencies for Government and many that
work in the industry workforce programs.
In the 2018 reauthorization, the committee stood up an
industrywide FAA working group to address shortcomings of the
Designated Pilot Examiner program. As you know, the DPE
examines and checkrides for pilots to determine the pilot's
knowledge and capability of flying aircraft. Just last summer,
the working group developed 12 recommendations to improve the
program, and we would like the committee to review and assist
with possible implementation to avoid the years of delay in
fixing this program. We simply don't have enough DPEs in the
system to keep up with the demand. Pilots, whether new or
experienced, shouldn't have to wait weeks or months to get a
checkride.
AOPA conducted a national survey of 800 airports that found
that 71 percent have a shortage of GA hangars. In many
instances, airports have the land to construct hangars but lack
financial resources, and may have a waiting list years' long
for hangars.
Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring the
subcommittee's attention to an issue that has been and remains
a top concern among every sector of the pilot community: the
lack of transient ramp space at federally obligated public-use
airports. While we support the FBO industry and most provide
excellent services, I have a letter here that has over 300
organizations on board representing hundreds of thousands of
pilots flying every category of aircraft from every region
across the country, and I urge the committee to address this
issue. This has been one of the most frustrating issues since
the committee addressed the medical reform for GA pilots.
I want to be clear. This is a national problem, not a one-
off or a local issue. All federally obligated airports are
subject to rules and regulations that impact safety and the
users of the national system. All of these airports should be
required to treat all users the same when it comes to public
access.
For pilot organizations like AOPA representing general
aviation pilots, we believe that one should not be required to
pay private business for services the pilot never asked for or
needed. This is exactly what is happening at hundreds of
public-use airports, especially those that have entered into
lease agreements with large chain FBOs in a monopoly position.
Not a day goes by that I don't hear from pilots about this. I
have been in business all my life. I have never known anyone
that charges a customer for services the person never wanted or
asked for. So, I hear about it often.
On behalf of the organizations and the pilots across the
country, we strongly support and request the committee to
include a provision in the reauthorization bill that addresses
public-use airports in these areas. Thank you.
[Mr. Baker's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Mark Baker, President and Chief Executive
Officer, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association
Introduction
Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Cohen and Members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to provide the Aircraft
Owners and Pilots Association's (or AOPA) perspective on ``Securing the
Future of General Aviation.''
AOPA is the world's largest aviation membership organization,
representing the general aviation interests of more than 300,000
aircraft owners and pilots across the country. Our members collectively
operate over 85% of all general aviation (GA) aircraft in the United
States and represent two-thirds of all pilots.
AOPA was founded in 1939, and for 84 years, we have stayed true to
our mission of protecting the freedom to fly. Safety remains AOPA's
north star--guiding, protecting, and promoting this uniquely American
experience, so we can pass it along, better than we received it, to the
next generation of aviators. Introducing the next generation of
Americans, especially young people from diverse backgrounds into
aviation and aerospace is vital to our industry's future.
Impact of General Aviation:
General aviation in America provides a significant economic impact
to the communities in which we all live and fly--GA is a $247 billion
industry and supports more than 1.2 million jobs.
Through the network of more than 5,000 public-use airports across
the country, which is 10 times the amount served by commercial
airlines, as well as over 14,700 privately owned landing facilities
nationwide, general aviation is an integral part of the transportation
system that supports communities across the United States, especially
in rural areas. GA is simply institutional in the fabric of America.
General aviation provides a great deal of public-benefit flying in
times of need. These vital operations include emergency medical
personnel and supplies delivery, disaster relief and recovery, search
and rescue, humanitarian assistance, law enforcement, agricultural
aviation activities, and much more. GA also provides the most efficient
and cost-effective way to conduct wildlife surveys, map wetland losses
and soil erosion, and detect pipeline spills.
The Committee's leadership in several areas impacting GA are
noteworthy including the BasicMed program, in which nearly 80,000
pilots in the United States having completed the requirements to fly
safely since the program's inception.
We are encouraged Full Committee Chairman Graves announced he will
include a standalone general aviation title in the upcoming FAA
Reauthorization bill. I know others have also expressed support for
this valuable inclusion, and we look forward to working with all
Members of the Committee to help secure the future of general aviation.
Improving General Aviation Safety:
The FAA operates the largest, most complicated, and safest aviation
system in the world. While every aircraft accident makes headline news,
what does not make the news is that general aviation comprises 26
million flight hours per year, representing more than 30 million
takeoffs and landings by hundreds of thousands of general aviation
pilots.
In short, general aviation has never been safer--and it's getting
safer every day. According to the latest available data through fiscal
year (FY) 2021--see chart below--the general aviation fatal accident
rate has fallen to just 0.74 occurrences per 100,000 flight hours. This
rate is less than half of what it was in the mid-1990s.
[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

What is as impressive, and demonstrates this strong safety culture
of GA, is that this ongoing, steady decline has happened while the
skies are busier than ever. When I'm asked if GA is safe--I don't
hesitate with a resounding ``absolutely.''
The General Aviation Joint Safety Committee (GAJSC), co-chaired by
leaders from AOPA's Air Safety Institute (ASI) and the FAA, analyzes
mishap data to develop safety recommendations and drive implementation
across the industry. Once again, we are on track to exceed the safety
goal established by the GAJSC which will result in another 10%
reduction in fatal accidents over ten years.
As indicated in the chart below, the outlook for GA safety
continues to improve as the number of fatal GA accidents so far in FY23
are below the goals established by the GAJSC.

[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

While we have come a long way in general aviation safety and
achieved impressive results there is always so much more we can do.
Safety is embedded in our culture and our highly respected Air Safety
Institute continues to work every day to educate and improve safety
where we can.
Filling the Aviation Workforce Pipeline:
Aviation--whether GA, commercial, or military--cannot exist without
qualified professionals to fly, design, build, operate, and maintain
our crewed and uncrewed aircraft. Today, we face a critical shortage of
workers in all these fields.
The Boeing Pilot and Technician Outlook for 2022-2041 predicts that
the long-term demand for newly qualified aviation personnel remains
strong, as 602,000 new pilots, 610,000 new maintenance technicians and
899,000 new cabin crew members will be needed worldwide over the next
20 years.
In North America alone, Boeing predicts the need for 435,000
personnel, including 128,000 new pilots, 134,000 new technicians and
173,000 new cabin crew members during this time period.
Most people that aspire to become aviators start in general
aviation, so it is important that we collaborate on efforts to ensure
that this pipeline remains open to all. AOPA has taken a leadership
role in attracting young people interested in aviation by making major
investments in high school and STEM curriculum.
Through the AOPA Foundation, we have developed a rigorous four-year
high school aviation STEM curriculum. AOPA High School Aviation STEM
Curriculum is now in more than 400 schools in 43 states, engaging more
than 16,300 students. Since the program's inception five years ago, we
have reached more than 50,000 students, and a full 70% of those who
have graduated report they are actively pursuing an aviation career.
Moreover, nearly half of our curriculum students are students of
color, with more than 20% female. This participation represents a
significant increase in diversity when compared to the current aviation
workforce.
Congress and this Committee has played an important role to address
the workforce challenges as well. The 2018 FAA Reauthorization law
included two aviation workforce development programs (aircraft pilots
and aviation maintenance technicians) which had strong bipartisan
support. These programs, commonly referred to as Section 625 and
authorized at $5 million per year through FY23 have helped introduce
high school students and others to science, technology, engineering,
math (STEM) aviation education and opportunities.
However, workforce issues are not a core mission of the FAA and
with the Section 625 grant programs set to expire, now is the time to
establish the National Center for the Advancement of Aviation (NCAA)
and let the FAA focus on modernizing the air traffic control system,
the NOTAM system, the pilot medical system, the aircraft registration
system, and airman and aircraft certification, these are the primary
safety and regulatory functions of the FAA.
National Center for the Advancement of Aviation Act:
During the 117th Congress, bipartisan and bicameral legislation was
introduced to establish a National Center for the Advancement of
Aviation (HR 3482/S. 1752) to address the aviation workforce challenges
our industry faces. We appreciate the leadership of this Committee to
move the bill which overwhelmingly passed the House last September by a
vote of 369-56.
A national aviation center would create programs to further build a
diverse and skilled aviation workforce and ensure the deployment of
STEM aviation educational opportunities for middle and high school
students. In fact, the center would do more to grow, develop, and
promote aviation and bring the needed and long overdue collaboration of
our collective industry that is so vital to our nation's economy.
The NCAA has the support of the entire aviation industry from
general aviation, airlines, unions, airports, and others.
We look forward to working with the Committee to advance this
bipartisan legislation once again.
Public-Use Airports/Transient Ramps/Pricing Transparency:
Our nation's public-use airports are clearly a valuable and
critical part of America's infrastructure.
AOPA has heard from thousands of our members and pilots across the
country who are frustrated when they land at airports and learn of
unexpected fees being levied by FBOs even when not receiving or
requesting services and often surprised at the amounts being charged.
Fixed based operators (FBO) owned by small companies or by the
airport sponsor do a great job making their parking fees transparent
and provide excellent service to pilots of all types of aircraft.
However there remains a general lack of transparency of parking fees
charged by the major fixed based operators (FBO), as well as the lack
of transient parking areas at federally funded public-use airports.
Everywhere I travel, I hear from AOPA members who believe there needs
to be a requirement for FBOs to make their fees transparent and easily
available to pilots like any other product or service today.
The type of fees charged to pilots by the FBOs include tie-down
fees, facility fees, infrastructure fees, access fees, security fees,
and handling fees. AOPA receives thousands of complaints from pilots
who are often charged for services they don't even ask for or receive.
There is absolutely no reason a pilot should be charged exorbitant fees
to park his or her aircraft when receiving no services from the FBO. It
doesn't happen on our nation's highway rest areas, and it shouldn't
happen at public-use airports.
We believe pilots should have the information they need to make
informed preflight planning decisions before landing at a public-use
airport. In 2018, AOPA led a voluntary industry campaign known as
``Know Before You Go'' to encourage FBOs to publicly list their fees
online. Most FBOs serve the general aviation community by balancing
their need for profitability with the need to provide reasonable
prices, and while a vast majority of FBOs now openly disclose their
pricing, many still don't. After four years of direct outreach to the
chain FBO companies to encourage parking fee transparency, at least 25%
of these FBOs are still not complying with the ``Know Before You Go''
program.
While the call for fee and pricing transparency has been a
voluntary effort, we believe pilots have a right to know, before they
fly, what fees they should expect when arriving at an airport and what
they cost.
In addition to fee and pricing transparency, we hear from thousands
of members about the lack of GA transient aircraft parking space,
especially at airports where a chain FBO controls the entire parking
ramp or has a monopoly position. Upon landing at these airports, pilots
are directed to the FBO parking ramp, where many only stay for a few
hours and do not need or require the services of the FBO. It is no
surprise these pilots are outraged when presented with a bill, in the
hundreds if not thousands of dollars to simply park their aircraft or
drop off a passenger.
AOPA was recently made aware of a pilot who flew his single engine
turboprop-powered aircraft from Ormond Beach, Florida to the St
Augustine airport for lunch--about a twenty-minute flight. He was
directed to park at the only FBO on the airport, and after a one-hour
visit, he was presented with parking and security fees totaling
$280.00. A flight instructor and a student pilot landed at an airport
so the student could use the restroom--10 minutes--and the pilot was
charged $80. We have thousands of examples like these.
We also dedicated considerable time and resources over the last
four years to research how GA transient parking areas are depicted at
the 700 public-use airports with published airport diagrams. Just last
year, the FAA agreed to publish guidance to airports in using these
terms to describe GA parking areas, which includes the term ``GA
Transient Apron''. This term describes a parking area where transient
general aviation operators can park their aircraft without FBO services
and may be subject to a fair and reasonable fee if the airport decided
to implement such a fee.
The FAA is planning to expand the number of diagramed airports from
700 to 3,000 in the near future and airport managers will be asked to
choose the appropriate standardized labels for their diagrams. We
appreciate the FAA's action in this area, but with the large number of
complaints about high parking fees charged by chain FBOs and the lack
of GA transient parking options at federally funded public-use
airports, we believe the Committee should address these issues.
We believe public-use airports should be required to designate a
transient GA parking area to be made available to pilots of all
privately operated general aviation aircraft, regardless of make or
model. Additionally, airports should retain the ability to either waive
a transient fee or impose a transient fee, so long as that fee is fair
and reasonable (essentially whatever it costs the airport to operate
and maintain the ramp).
We have a national system of airports and designating GA transient
parking should not be delegated to airports as a local issue. With the
recent increase in FBO consolidation, including equity firms acquiring
large chain FBOs and expecting a return on their investment, this lack
of fair and reasonably priced GA transient parking at public-use
airports is troubling.
At the few hundred airports that provide commercial air service,
and also support high levels of GA aircraft, airport managers must
satisfy TSA security requirements to maintain their FAA Part 139
certification. These airports should also be required to designate GA
transient parking areas, and pilots wishing to use these GA transient
parking areas should be allowed to apply for TSA security badges for
access when they are located near commercial service activities. This
would also eliminate the need for added security personnel and would
help defray any additional security costs at these airports.
The Committee should consider addressing the transient ramp issue.
Such a proposal should include the following:
1)  All public-use airports should have a transient ramp space
(construct or designate) and have the ability to charge a fair and
reasonable fee (cost to operate and maintain);
2)  Transient ramp space should be made available to all privately-
operated aircraft, regardless of make or model;
3)  Private pilots should have the ability to apply for a SIDA
badge to defray security costs at airports where TSA security
requirements are in place; and
4)  Public-use airports should be required to either impose a fair
and reasonable fee and continue to have the ability to waive fees (like
many small and municipal airports do today).
Need for Additional GA Hangars:
Another area of concern to GA's future is the decreasing supply of
general aviation hangars across the country. Aircraft hangars are
integral to the utility of any airport and invite economic investment
and growth to local communities. They are also increasingly important,
and sometimes required by aircraft insurance companies, to protect the
fabric or composite airframes of aircraft, new and old.
Airports wishing to build new hangars find that federal AIP funds
are not prioritized for GA hangar construction, and the price to build
hangars usually exceeds the airports' ability to pay for them outright.
In 2021, AOPA conducted a national survey of 800 airports and found
that 71% of airports have a shortage of individual GA hangars. In fact,
55% of those surveyed said they have the land to develop additional
hangars but do not have the financial resources to do so. Airport
managers also report that hangars provide 45% of their gross revenue,
making hangars a critical source of financial self-sustainability for
any GA airport.
Even if an airport is in the National Plan of Integrated Airport
Systems (NPIAS), hangars are generally not approved for AIP funding due
to other priorities.
Certain airports are turning to the construction of corporate
hangars and have developed plans, which the FAA has approved, to remove
smaller less profitable hangars to make room for the larger more
profitable hangars. Therefore, small aircraft hangars are
systematically replaced with larger corporate hangars, forcing these
aircraft off the airport or parking outside where they are subjected to
wind, rain, sun, and snow. This happened recently when over 70 GA
storage hangars were replaced with corporate hangars at a Scottsdale,
Arizona airport, and it is about to happen with 51 hangars at the
Birmingham-Shuttleworth airport in Alabama.
Under current FAA policy, hangars are among the lowest priorities
for AIP funding and grants for hangar development are rarely issued.
With a nationwide shortage of small aircraft storage hangars, we need
to protect the ones we have while also investing in the development of
new GA hangars to meet the overwhelming demand.
We believe Congress should dedicate adequate AIP funding for GA
hangar development. The result is securing the future of GA and a win-
win as airports would gain a much-needed source of sustainable revenue,
and pilots would be able to protect the investment in their aircraft.
The new hangars would attract additional aircraft which would boost the
airports economic contribution to the community and improve the
airport's ability to achieve financial self-sustainability.
Crosswind Runways:
Crosswind runways enhance the safety and capacity of the National
Plan of Integrated Airport Systems. Nearly one third of airports in the
NPIAS have a crosswind runway in addition to the airport's primary
runway. They were constructed at airports where changes in wind
conditions during certain periods made the primary runway unsafe to
use. Like all pavement, crosswind runways require periodic maintenance,
or they deteriorate until they become unserviceable. Although runway
projects are supposed to be among the highest priority projects,
current FAA policy has created an insurmountable barrier for hundreds
of airports in the system to maintain their crosswind runways.
GA's excellent safety record is attributable, in part, to the
existence of more than 900 crosswind runways. They are critically
important to light GA aircraft, particularly those with conventional
landing gear. If crosswind runways are allowed to deteriorate, it will
affect flight safety. Moreover, flight training will be hindered as
student pilots will be grounded when crosswinds prevail.
Today's FAA policy fails to account for the diversity and
limitations of GA aircraft. It focuses on the most demanding (usually
heaviest or fastest) aircraft to use an airport. These aircraft can
tolerate stronger crosswinds than lighter, smaller aircraft can. What
may be a safe crosswind level for large aircraft is often not safe for
light GA aircraft. Yet, once it is determined that the airport is safe
for large aircraft, the needs of light GA aircraft are not considered
unless very specific, unrealistic conditions are met.
As we look to make meaningful investments in airports, Congress
should direct the FAA to make grants available for crosswind runway
projects in a manner that serves all segments of aviation.
Non-Primary Entitlement Program:
The Airport Improvement Program provides federal grants for the
planning and development of public-use airports that are included in
the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems. Funding for small
general aviation airports comes partly from AIP grants under the Non-
Primary Entitlement (NPE) category and discretionary account. GA
airports are each currently eligible to receive up to $150,000 in
annual entitlements. The entitlements are often not enough to finance
projects and are often unused and returned to the FAA discretionary
account.
We believe Congress should reform the NPE program to ensure funds
are spent at airports for which they are intended. This action will
also help secure the future of general aviation.
AOPA works closely with our partners at DOT, FAA, and other federal
agencies on the many issues that impact general aviation and pilots. We
value the work that has been accomplished but more can be done to
benefit the general aviation community.
Designated Pilot Examiners (DPEs):
For several years now, pilots have raised concerns regarding the
lack of availability of designated pilot examiners (DPEs) across the
country. To become a certified pilot, an individual must complete
numerous flight examinations throughout their flight training which are
typically performed by delegates of the FAA, known as DPEs.
The next generation of aviation professionals will be unable to
meet their aviation dreams without adequate availability and access to
DPEs to take and complete the required FAA flight examinations. While
the FAA has implemented some programs that have provided limited
relief, designee availability remains a challenge. To ensure the future
growth of the pilot population, especially with the increased demand
for flight training and this nation's overall need for pilots,
additional DPE reform is needed to ensure an adequate number of DPEs
are available and accessible.
To address these concerns, Congress should require the FAA to
implement the recommendations in the report from the Designated Pilot
Examiner Reform Working Group to ensure an adequate number of designees
are available. Additionally, the FAA should complete a review of
current DPEs for their activity and replace DPEs not performing an
appropriate number of examinations, while ensuring newly selected
examiners can fully support applicants in their area. Additional focus
must be placed on selecting DPEs who do not provide examinations
exclusively to one school to ensure trained applicants at schools
without examining authority have appropriate access to DPE services.
Flight Training:
The FAA has long recognized the importance of pilots obtaining
flight instruction in the aircraft they intend to operate. Doing so
ensures pilots have access to relevant training, experience, and flight
testing in the specific aircraft to be flown, which is a significant
factor in making our aviation system the safest in the world.
Unfortunately, pilots and flight instructors who operate certain
categories of aircraft suddenly had their accessibility to flight
instruction and flight testing restricted due to a 2021 FAA legal
argument that instruction and testing as carrying a person ``for hire''
like a commercial carrier.
With the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's leadership
and support, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal
Year 2023 included language that addressed the 2021 FAA directive.
Unfortunately, the final version only addressed a small sector of the
general aviation industry and it did not fully return the flight
training accessibility to what had been in place for over 70 years.
Since at least 1949, student instruction was not considered
carriage of goods or persons for compensation or hire. For safety, we
must restore this commonsense approach and Congress should direct the
FAA to mandate that student instruction, flight training and testing
shall not be considered carrying persons or property for compensation
or hire. This clarification will restore safety in the National
Airspace System through reducing barriers to training and will reduce
the FAA's administrative burdens.
Aircraft Registration Renewal and Registration Numbers:
With the Committee's leadership to change the aircraft registration
renewal from three years to seven years under the 2018 FAA
Reauthorization Act, we are pleased the FAA has finally moved the
aircraft registration renewal period to seven years. The extension from
three to seven years will have a positive effect on reducing the FAA's
unacceptable backlog of registration renewals of six months and
sometimes longer.
However, while the FAA registry has been making progress to reduce
the backlog from a high of over 190 days to under 120 days, there is
still a long way to go for the FAA to get down to a reasonable renewal
time. Congress should mandate a review of the FAA's aircraft
registration system and require the agency to come up with a plan to
bring the registration process time down to 30 days in the near term.
In addition, the FAA should ensure that once an aircraft owner
submits a renewal application and it is accepted into the FAA registry
for processing, the temporary registration remains in effect until the
permanent registration is received, regardless of how long the FAA
takes to provide the permanent registration.
Another concern is aircraft registration numbers (or N numbers)
being routinely reserved via computers and held in bulk which can
unfairly eliminate the possibility of general aviation aircraft owners
from obtaining the registration numbers they request. Some companies
reserving N numbers in bulk are then selling them for exorbitant fees
to aircraft owners desiring the N number. The current process is unfair
by not allowing aircraft owners to obtain desired registration numbers.
To address this unfair and predatory practice, Congress should require
the FAA to review how registration numbers are reserved and enact
process changes to ensure fair participation by eliminating computer-
generated bulk reservations for aircraft registration numbers.
Unleaded Aviation Fuel and the EAGLE Initiative:
There is no more pressing issue that general aviation faces today
than the need to transition to 100% unleaded fuel.
We in General Aviation want lead out of fuel but it must be done in
a safe and smart way.
The general aviation community and FAA have been working to find an
unleaded fuel for more than a decade, now with two approval pathways:
the Piston Aviation Fuels Initiative (PAFI), a public-private
initiative, and Supplemental Type Certificate (STC), which allows the
FAA to approve fuels developed by private entities. Congress has
strongly supported the effort, and since FY12, Congress has
appropriated $57 million to PAFI, which includes an additional $10
million provided in the FY23 Omnibus Appropriations bill.
Just last year, the FAA gave STC approval for virtually the entire
GA piston fleet for a 100-octane unleaded avgas developed by General
Aviation Modifications Inc. (GAMI) of Oklahoma. GAMI is currently
working on commercializing its fuel, encompassing the refinement,
logistics, and storage needed to get this fuel to our airports.
Swift Fuels is working on another 100-octane unleaded fuel and
reports that it should gain STC approval later this year. In addition,
two fuels are showing progress through the PAFI program. The industry's
clear goal is to find a drop-in 100-octane fuel that can be safely used
by all piston powered aircraft in the GA fleet.
The FAA, and hundreds of industry stakeholders representing every
corner of aviation and those that have a vested interest in this safe
transition, have come together under the public-private EAGLE
initiative (which stands for Eliminate Aviation Gasoline Lead
Emissions). This partnership has one goal in mind: removing lead from
all aviation fuel no later than 2030 and no matter from where that
fuel(s) come from.
I serve as co-chair of the Eliminate Aviation Gasoline Lead
Emissions (EAGLE) program, along with the FAA's executive director of
aircraft certification, and we are laser focused on the goal of
removing lead from aviation gasoline by 2030, hopefully sooner.
While these are very positive steps, a real threat to general
aviation safety is being played out in Santa Clara County, California,
with other locales looking closely at what is happening there.
Santa Clara County's action last year to prematurely ban the
higher-octane fuel (100 low lead) that is required by thousands of
general aviation aircraft to fly safely is simply irresponsible.
Putting the wrong fuel in an aircraft can cause catastrophic engine
failure--placing the pilot and those on the ground in danger.
Aircraft needing this higher-octane fuel include those flying
missions of search and rescue, disaster relief and law enforcement. We
understand that some of these important missions from Reid-Hillview in
Santa Clara County have shelved, which is unfortunate news to local
residents who rely on these services. In addition, there has already
been one reported aircraft accident in Santa Clara County that has been
directly attributed to misfuelling, primarily because the fuel needed
to fly safely was not available.
AOPA and the general aviation community, including airports, fully
supports removing lead from aviation gasoline. As we transition, we
also need to ensure the safety of pilots and require airports to
fulfill their AIP grant assurances by making 100LL available until a
fleet wide solution is readily available. Airports accepting funds are
legally bound to not discriminate against any class of aircraft at
their airports, including the fuel they need to fly safely.
The unfortunate action by Santa Clara County, left unchecked, could
have an unfortunate domino effect across the 5,000 public-use airports
across this country, thereby posing significant consequences to general
aviation in the United States. By working together, we can achieve our
goal of removing lead from aviation gasoline and ensuring a safe and
smart transition to get us there.
Conclusion:
We have an opportunity with this year's FAA Reauthorization to set
the course for securing the future for general aviation. I would like
to again thank the Subcommittee for this important hearing today. AOPA
looks forward to working with the Committee on the upcoming FAA
Reauthorization bill on the issues outlined today and others that
impact pilots and aircraft owners.

Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Baker.
I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record the letter
referenced by Mr. Baker in his testimony.
And without objection, so ordered.

Letter of March 9, 2023, to Hon. Sam Graves, Chairman, and Hon. Rick
Larsen, Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
and Hon. Garret Graves, Chairman, and Hon. Steve Cohen, Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Aviation, from the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association et al., Submitted for the Record by Hon. Rudy Yakym III
March 9, 2023.
Honorable Sam Graves, Chairman,
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Honorable Rick Larsen, Ranking Member,
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Honorable Garret Graves, Chairman,
House Aviation Subcommittee,
2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Honorable Steve Cohen, Ranking Member,
House Aviation Subcommittee,
2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Messrs. Graves, Larsen, Graves, and Cohen,
We write today to express our strong support for an effort being
led by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) that calls for
the construction or implementation of transient parking ramps at
public-use airports.
Our organizations represent hundreds of thousands of pilots who own
and operate virtually every general aviation aircraft type in the
fleet, and we cannot agree more with AOPA and applaud their efforts. We
believe individual owner-operators of aircraft should not be required
to pay fees to a private business on a public-use airport when their
products and services are not used, needed, or requested.
Most Fixed-Based Operators (FBOs) provide excellent service and are
integral to our nation's aviation fabric. Unfortunately, there is a
lack of competition at many airports in our system which has led to
increasing prices and above normal profits. We have and continue to see
unprecedented consolidation in the FBO market, which has led to
monopolistic behaviors at many of our nation's public-use airports.
Clearly, private equity firms have prioritized returns on their
investments and placed the burden on the backs of pilots.
Simply said, we need policies at federally funded airports that
create competition and help incentivize aviation activity, not
unfettered practices that allow users of our aviation system to be
penalized. Unlike the airlines, private pilots do not have a process
available to negotiate fees and charges at airports.
Today, pilots are subject to a multitude of fees including tie down
fees, security fees, maintenance fees, building fees, handling fees,
habitat fees (offset for FBO employees working in high-cost areas), and
others even when no fuel is purchased or when their services have not
been requested. Many FBOs waive or reduce these fees when fuel is
purchased but those entities most often have extraordinarily high,
above market, fuel prices.
Again, we firmly believe policies at federally obligated public-use
airports should allow access without requiring private pilots to pay
businesses for something they did not need or request. We also believe
public-use airports should be required to provide access to an
itinerant ramp for parking with the ability to impose a fair and
reasonable fee.
In order for general aviation to grow and prosper in this nation,
we respectfully request the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee address this issue in the impending FAA Reauthorization.
We are more than happy to provide any additional information the
Committee may need.
Sincerely,
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.

Mr. Yakym. Next we are going to hear from Mr. Jack Pelton,
CEO and chairman of the board for the Experimental Aircraft
Association.
You are recognized for 5 minutes for your testimony.

TESTIMONY OF JACK J. PELTON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, EXPERIMENTAL AIRCRAFT ASSOCIATION

Mr. Pelton. Thank you and good morning, Chairman Graves,
Ranking Member Larsen, and the rest of the Aviation
Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting EAA, the Experimental
Aircraft Association, today to provide our input on ``FAA
Reauthorization: Securing the Future of General Aviation.''
EAA is an organization that has been around for 70 years,
who originally was founded for people who are building and
restoring their own airplanes. Today, we essentially represent
the entire spectrum of recreational aviation. We have over one-
quarter of a million members, over 900 local chapters, and we
host over 14,000 aviation activities each year. If you look at
the fleetwide survey that was done by the FAA, the active fleet
of amateur-built aircraft has grown by more than 30 percent in
the last 20 years. And actually, on an annual basis, there are
about 1,000 new amateur-built aircraft that enter the NAS.
One of the initiatives that we are well known for is our
Young Eagles program, which is in its 30th year. Our Young
Eagles program takes young people for their first experience in
flight, through our members who provide their airplane, their
time, and their fuel to provide these free introductory
flights. We have flown over 2.3 million young people, and this
experience has introduced them to general aviation, and then
many of them have pursued careers as military or airline
pilots, aerospace engineers, and a host of other aviation-
related activities. So, we have created a generation,
essentially, of people who have a deeper appreciation for
aviation, thanks to their first flight with EAA.
We also participate in summer Air Academy residence camps
in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. And we have online portals for young
people and teachers to learn and understand more about general
aviation.
A lot of people think of us as just the association that
has an annual convention held in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where over
10,000 aircraft arrive, and 600,000 people attend from 90
nations. I had the opportunity to take the equivalent of the
FAA Administrator from Germany around, who looked at me and
said, ``You have more airplanes, general aviation airplanes, on
the ground here than we have registered in the country of
Germany.''
Ranking Member Cohen had outlined general aviation's
importance to the aviation industry, and I will not continue to
go back over that. It is clear that we are positioned as a
world leader, but we have concerns. One of the foundations is
general aviation, and we must retain this position. We must
take action to ensure that our general aviation remains safe,
healthy, and robust, since we are the gateway to aviation.
We want to thank Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee Chairman Graves for understanding this, and
addressing GA specifically in the next reauthorization bill.
Key components to the industry's success is effective,
efficient, and consistent regulatory oversight. FAA oversees
and regulates almost all aspects of aviation, including air
traffic control; aircraft design; production and maintenance;
pilot, mechanic, and crew certification; and airport
operations. Aviation struggles when FAA is unable to provide
timely oversight or inefficiently exercises its regulatory
authority. Industry is stymied by the delays in processing of
aircraft registrations, or the issuance of pilot and mechanic
certificates at all levels, and timely completion of aircraft
certification programs.
Pilot training is a great example. As Mr. Baker mentioned,
the shortage that we have with the Designated Pilot Examiners
is a crisis that needs to be addressed. And we hope that in an
FAA reauthorization, you can implement the recommendations of
the Designated Pilot Examiner Reforms Working Group that came
up with the recommendation to have national oversight as
opposed to oversight at the local FSDOs.
We also think, as part of that specialty, DPEs should have
the ability to go back to when we had the all makes and model
authorization for experimental warbirds.
Our number-one issue is Modernization of Special
Airworthiness Certificates. This is a regulatory rulemaking
activity with a significant opportunity to grow general
aviation with the expansion of existing aircraft categories
called light-sport aircraft, the current class of aircraft
whose size and weight limitations restrict their useful
training and commercial viability in the market. We are asking
Congress to ensure that critical rulemaking continues to have
the support it needs by directing the FAA to publish, by the
end of 2024, this very important regulatory change.
The EAGLE fuel program was mentioned, of which we are
strong supporters and participants in. And what we do need is
to make sure that Congress can help the safe introduction of
the new fuel, while still maintaining the supply of 100 Low
Lead, so that nobody is left grounded.
I greatly appreciate the opportunity to appear before this
committee and provide our views, the challenges, and
opportunities. I look forward to working with Congress and the
FAA to ensure the United States remains the gold standard in
aviation, and that general aviation continues as a vibrant
foundation to that standard. Thank you.
[Mr. Pelton's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Jack J. Pelton, Chief Executive Officer and
Chairman of the Board, Experimental Aircraft Association
Introduction
Good morning Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Cohen, and members of
the Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting the Experimental Aircraft
Association (EAA) to be here today and to provide our input on FAA
Reauthorization: Securing the Future of General Aviation. My name is
Jack Pelton and I am EAA's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the
Board.
Founded on January 26, 1953, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as a local
club for those who built and restored their own aircraft, EAA has
developed to become a vibrant and growing international aviation
community representing virtually the entire spectrum of recreational
aviation. Today, EAA is headquartered in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, as a non-
profit 501(c)(3) corporation, we encompass more than a quarter million
members in more than 100 countries, with over 900 local chapters. The
Chapter network is the backbone of EAA and is responsible for more than
14,000 aviation activities each year.
While the initial purpose of EAA was to aid and assist amateur
aircraft builders, we now encompass all of recreational aviation and
the promotion of aviation safety throughout general aviation. EAA
initially established the segment of general aviation called
experimental amateur-built, supporting those people that choose to
build and fly their own aircraft. According to the FAA's General
Aviation and Part 135 Activity Survey, the active fleet of amateur-
built aircraft has grown more than 30% over the past 20 years. This
proves that the homebuilding community is an essential growth sector of
general aviation--with challenges across the general aviation industry
over the past few decades this steady gain is an impressive
accomplishment. Today, amateur-built aircraft encompass more than 17%
of the entire active single-engine piston fleet, and every year our
members add approximately one thousand new amateur-built aircraft to
the National Airspace System.
As we celebrate our 70th anniversary this year, our mission remains
unchanged. We are as dedicated to growing participation in aviation as
our founders were in the beginning. We strive to make aviation easier,
more accessible, more rewarding, and more fun--igniting and nurturing
interest by embracing ``The Spirit of Aviation'' in all that we do.
In 2022 we celebrated the 30th anniversary of our Young Eagles
program, which provides free introductory flights to youth through a
well-structured program utilizing our chapters and members who
volunteer to provide these flights. Acting on our mission of growing
participation, Young Eagles has to date provided nearly 2.3 million
flight experiences. That's millions of young people who have been
introduced to general aviation, many who have then pursued careers as
military or airline pilots, aerospace engineers or a host of other
aviation related professions. This program has created a generation of
people who have a deeper appreciation for aviation thanks to that free
first flight.
EAA's focus on youth education also includes our Air Academy
residence camp, our online AeroEducate portal for young people and
teachers, and numerous other youth-focused aviation programs based
within our local chapters and at our headquarters in Oshkosh.
In addition, EAA's annual convention, EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, is
the world's largest fly-in event, with 10,000 aircraft gathering in
Oshkosh along with an annual attendance surpassing 600,000, from more
than 90 nations. It is THE gathering place for general aviation in
America each summer, where new innovations and technologies are
unveiled, and more than 1,000 forums cover all facets of aviation.
General Aviation's Value to the United States
The general aviation industry contributes an estimated $247 billion
in economic output and 1.2 million jobs in the United States. It
provides a lifeline to many towns across the country and provides
critical services in times of natural disasters such as hurricanes,
flooding, and wildfires. Our nation is served by more than 5,000
public-use airports, 13,000 private airports and airstrips, and 5,500
heliports across the country.
General aviation is an integral part of the transportation system
that supports communities across the United States, especially in rural
areas, by providing essential air travel options to businesses and the
public, forging links between thousands of companies, their suppliers,
and their customers. General aviation operations include emergency
medical personnel and supplies delivery, disaster relief and recovery,
search and rescue, agricultural aviation activities, recreational
pursuits, personal transportation, and more. General aviation also
supports commercial aviation through the training of a significantly
large percentage of airline pilots.
The United States as a World Leader in Aviation
The United States' position as the world leader in aviation is
established on the foundation provided by general aviation. For the
United States to retain this leadership position, we must take action
to ensure that our general aviation community remains healthy and
robust.
General aviation typically serves as the gateway to almost all
others facets of aviation. The nation's local airports, located in big
cities, small towns, and rural areas repeatedly serve as the
introduction to aviation for nearly everyone who enters or is
associated with aviation. Ask any pilot or aircraft mechanic,
commercial, military, or civilian, about how they were introduced to
aviation, and it will likely involve an early encounter with general
aviation at a local airport.
The United States' position as the leader in training of pilots and
maintainers, designing and producing of new aircraft, and developing
and implementing new technologies can only continue with a robust and
healthy aviation industry, and that must include a robust and healthy
general aviation component.
Challenges and Opportunities Facing General Aviation
A key component to the success of the aviation industry in the
United States is to have effective, efficient, timely, and consistent
regulatory oversight. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) serves
as the regulatory agency with responsibility for the National Airspace
System (NAS) and safety must always be its primary focus. To do so, the
FAA oversees almost all aspects of aviation including air traffic
control, aircraft design, production and maintenance, pilot, mechanic
and crew certification, airport operations, and installation and
maintenance of navigation aids.
Many sectors of general aviation struggle when the FAA is unable to
provide timely oversight or to exercise its regulatory authority
effectively or efficiently. Today, our industry is being stymied by
delays in the processing of aircraft registrations, the issuance of
pilot and mechanic certificates at all levels, and the timely
completion of aircraft certification programs. In many cases, it is not
just the delay, but the uncertainty of not knowing how long the delay
will be.
For individuals preparing for practical tests, the delay adds cost
to already expensive training programs. Additional training including
instructor and equipment costs to maintain proficiency and, in some
cases, needed travel expenses, adds stress and hassle to an already
challenging situation. Companies developing new aircraft or components
and undergoing certification, or those that rely on their aircraft and
are awaiting approval of new equipment installations, are in the
position of not knowing when they may be granted their approvals. From
a business perspective, the uncertainty of not having a timeline is
worse than having a very long timeline.
To be successful, industry must be able to rely on a consistent
regulatory structure and timelines. These delays are the result of a
combination of dated programs, lack of staffing, and a shortage of
qualified individuals in many critical FAA offices. These delays are
compounded by a lack of agency-wide reporting of key performance
indicators that provide important statistics on the status, efficiency,
and effectiveness of the FAA's oversight of the industry.
Designated Pilot Examiners
To address the issues in pilot certification, the agency should
expand its use of the Designated Pilot Examiners by moving oversight
from the local to national level to further leverage the resources and
knowledge of the General Aviation industry. The aviation industry is
currently facing a significant shortage of Designated Pilot Examiners
(DPE) nationwide, with some Examiners maintaining a wait time of 4-6
weeks to schedule a practical test to issue a pilot certificate. The
problem appears to be rooted in the systematic oversight of Examiners
through the FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) network.
The FAA should implement the recommendations of the Designated
Pilot Examiner Reforms Working Group (DPERWG) as established by the
Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) which includes the
implementation of a national oversight program for all Examiners.
Nationalizing Examiner oversight, moving oversight to the FAA
Headquarters level, will address the issue of Examiner shortage by
removing the requirement for an appropriately qualified Aviation Safety
Inspector at each office. This program will also focus the FAA's
resources ensuring Examiner deployment is adequately resourced and will
standardize the selection process making for a more transparent
national system.
Modernization of Special Airworthiness Certificates
EAA works closely with a number of FAA offices on the development
and ongoing improvement of programs important to the growth and health
of general aviation. One effort currently underway that presents a
significant opportunity to grow the general aviation industry is the
Modernization of Special Airworthiness Certificates (MOSAIC)
rulemaking. MOSAIC is the expansion of the current Light Sport Aircraft
(LSA) standards. LSA is a current class of aircraft whose size and
weight restrictions limits their usefulness as training aircraft and
their commercial viability in the market. MOSAIC, as envisioned and
when implemented, has the potential to demonstrate how an Agency can
effectively expand a regulatory structure to support growth while
maintaining safety.
Thanks to action taken by current FAA leadership, the MOSAIC Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) is now expected in summer of 2023. We
feel Congress should ensure this critical rulemaking continues to have
the support it needs by directing the FAA to publish, by the end of
calendar year 2024, a final rule that expands the utilization of light-
sport aircraft, promotes their use in flight training and does so in a
manner that ensures U.S. manufacturers are not at a disadvantage to
foreign manufacturers.
Future Fuel for General Aviation
EAA remains firm in our support of efforts to remove lead from
aviation gasoline, and it is our position that any transition from
leaded to unleaded gasoline must be effectuated with safety as the
highest priority.
In an exhaustive 2021 report to the FAA on options for reducing
aviation lead emissions, the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine recommended that the ``FAA should continue to
collaborate with the [general aviation] industry, aircraft users,
airports, and fuel suppliers in the search for and deployment of an
acceptable and universally usable unleaded replacement fuel,'' urging a
``holistic process'' to develop and deploy such a fuel. Only through a
government-industry effort that would involve the private sector, the
FAA, and Congress could the aviation system eliminate lead emissions.
We agree with that conclusion, and accordingly the FAA, general
aviation associations, and other aviation stakeholders have launched a
public-private initiative titled ``General Aviation Commitment to
Eliminate Aviation Gasoline Lead Emissions,'' or ``EAGLE,'' which
intends to achieve its firm goal--elimination of lead emissions from
general aviation aircraft by the end of 2030, or sooner if possible--
through development and deployment of a viable high-octane unleaded
replacement aviation gasoline that can be safely operated by the U.S.
fleet with minimum impact.
The next 12 to 18 months will provide our industry with a better
understanding of our unleaded future. Four high-octane unleaded fuels
are currently in evaluation and/or deployment phases to determine
whether they are a viable replacements for our current fuel. In
September of 2022, the FAA approved the first high octane unleaded fuel
after many years of testing. The developers of this fuel, working with
industry partners, are now focused on the production and distribution
infrastructure needed to support the commercialization of this fuel.
Another of the four fuels has indicated that they expect to receive
their authorization from the FAA sometime this year. They will then
also be exploring the production and distribution of their fuels. The
two additional fuels are in various stages of testing with results and
potential authorizations anticipated in 2024.
Vital to a successful and stable transition to an unleaded fuel is
maintaining the availability of our current avgas during this period of
development, authorization for use, commercialization, and deployment.
The FAA plays a vital role in protecting the avgas supply throughout
this process, particularly on federally funded airports. It is
imperative that the FAA ensure the safe and coherent operation of the
National Airspace System by protecting the continued supply of aviation
gasoline with the timely and expedient enforcement of airport grant
obligations. We cannot undermine the vitality and importance of the
general aviation community while making progress toward an unleaded
future.
Additionally, the EAGLE initiative is currently looking at areas
for potential federal investment to facilitate this transition and we
would like to work with Congress as these initiatives are developed.
Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS or Drone) Integration
EAA remains committed to the philosophy that Uncrewed Aircraft
Systems (UAS) should be integrated into the National Airspace System,
while maintaining that the safety and sanctity of crewed aircraft must
remain absolutely paramount. Any changes to existing airspace,
procedures, or regulations that provide access to UAS cannot decrease
the safety, encumber in any operation that is presently allowed, nor
impose any equipment mandates on crewed aircraft beyond what is already
required. EAA supports integration and recognizes the benefits of
safely integrating UAS operations into the NAS. However, safety of
crewed aircraft and the public must always be the first priority of
integration.
We encourage Congress to ensure that the FAA continues to integrate
UAS into the National Airspace System without burdening the general
aviation community with cost or operating restrictions.
FAA Industry Engagement and Presence
With these challenges, we have seen a trend within the FAA to be
hesitant to send staff to in-person industry meetings and events. At a
time when the FAA is challenged to effectively administer programs,
engagement and communication with industry should be increased, not
decreased. We strongly encourage the FAA to continue to staff these
important meetings to ensure that industry is kept abreast of the
agency's challenges. It is through these meetings and discussions that
FAA and industry can develop strategies to work together to find
solutions and paths to most effectively utilize limited resources. Many
of these events also allow the FAA to maximize travel expenditures by
seeing numerous groups of the regulated community on the same trip,
which otherwise would require multiple trips or would eliminate
valuable face-to-face opportunities with the FAA.
Closing
We greatly appreciate the opportunity to appear before this
committee and provide our views on the challenges and opportunities
facing general aviation. Throughout our history, EAA has worked closely
with the FAA to develop programs that enabled and expanded the scope of
recreational aviation. We look forward to working with this Congress
and the FAA to ensure that the United States remains the gold-standard
in aviation and that general aviation continues as the vibrant
foundation to that standard.

Mr. Yakym. Thank you.
Mr. Rick Crider, testifying on behalf of the American
Association of Airport Executives, you are recognized for 5
minutes.

TESTIMONY OF RICK CRIDER, A.A.E., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF
AIRPORT/RAILPORT AND MILITARY RELATIONS, PORT SAN ANTONIO, ON
BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF AIRPORT EXECUTIVES

Mr. Crider. Thank you. Good morning, Vice Chair Yakym,
Ranking Member Cohen, members of the subcommittee. Thank you
for the opportunity to provide testimony and comment regarding
general aviation issues and the upcoming FAA reauthorization
process.
I am appearing today on behalf of AAAE and member airports
across the country, along with my own perspectives from
operating Kelly Field in San Antonio--one example of a vibrant,
joint-use industrial GA airport. It is an honor to join this
distinguished panel of industry leaders today and highlight the
importance of general aviation and GA airports.
GA airports often serve as key operational hubs for law
enforcement, firefighting, aerospace manufacturing, aircargo,
agriculture, and pilot training. They are important community
portals for business and private aircraft operations and, in
some cases, play the role of economic engines, job centers, and
R&D sites for new and emerging technologies.
While GA airports vary significantly in size, complexity,
and configuration, each provide unique functions and vital
capabilities. Industrial GA airports like Kelly Field provide
critical services to aircraft operators that require fleet
maintenance, refurbishment, updates, and modifications. Ten
months ago, the Port San Antonio opened a state-of-the-art
innovation center, which I described in my written testimony,
aimed at sparking interest in STEM within the student
populations of San Antonio and exposing opportunities in
aerospace and advanced technologies to the workforce of
tomorrow.
Kelly Field and other industrial GA airports are critical
to maintaining our Nation's dominant position in global
aerospace industry. When an aircraft is either delivered to its
customer or returned to service, thousands if not millions of
parts, components, and labor-hours are delivered to market.
The FAA NPIAS reports $12.5 billion in annual AIP and BIL-
eligible projects at civil airports. Almost $4 billion of that
total exists at nonprimary airports alone. When projects that
are not AIP or BIL-eligible are added in, airport
infrastructure needs to exceed well more than $20 billion
annually. This is roughly twice what airports received in AIP
grants, BIL funding, and PFC revenue every year.
Congress can help address this gap by increasing AIP
funding to at least $4 billion annually, authorizing additional
funds for supplemental grants, and providing airports with more
flexibility on how they invest those dollars. We urge Congress
to adjust the outdated GA entitlement, which has remained
stagnant at $150,000 for more than 20 years, and have other
recommendations that are more fully described in my written
testimony.
I thank the subcommittee for its strong support of the FAA
Contract Tower Program, a successful public-private partnership
that enhances aviation safety at GA and commercial service
airports around the country. Twenty-five Texas airports
participate in the Contract Tower Program. On behalf of my
colleagues in the Lone Star State, I urge you to take
additional steps to address staffing challenges, upgrade
outdated towers, and ensure controllers have access to
equipment that can increase their situational awareness.
Like our counterparts at commercial airports, GA airports
strive to be strong environmental stewards for their
communities. Through AAAE, GA airports are participating in the
EAGLE initiative to transition to lead-free avgas for piston-
engine aircraft by the end of 2030.
Airports are also eager to transition away from using
firefighting foam that contains PFAS to fluorine-free foam,
which is safer for the environment and firefighters alike. The
FAA is expected to approve fluorine-free alternatives soon, and
we ask Congress to help airports with that transition and
acknowledge FAA's longstanding mandate to use PFAS by providing
airports with CERCLA liability protection.
The future of advanced air mobility is quickly becoming the
present for the aviation industry. GA airports will likely play
a major role in this new AAM ecosystem, and are excited to help
make AAM a reality. However, to accommodate widespread use of
eVTOLs in the future, we will need significantly greater
electrical grid capacity and charging capabilities.
We will also need to work together to find ways to pay for
this infrastructure without reducing funds for traditional
airport projects.
Although travel has largely returned to pre-pandemic
levels, stakeholders across the aviation system are still
adjusting to the ripple effect caused by the pandemic. With the
current FAA authorization set to expire on September 30th, I
would like to commend this subcommittee for moving forward
quickly to complete a multiyear bill on time. Short-term
extensions bring about both uncertainty and a lack of
predictability for the aviation system, particularly for
airports that rely on AIP funds to modernize our
infrastructure.
On behalf of AAAE and all my colleagues at GA and
commercial service airports around the country, we look forward
to working with this subcommittee as you prepare for the next
FAA reauthorization bill. And I thank you, and look forward to
the questions that the subcommittee might have.
[Mr. Crider's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Rick Crider, A.A.E., Executive Vice President of
Airport/Railport and Military Relations, Port San Antonio, on behalf of
the American Association of Airport Executives
Chairs Graves and Graves, Ranking Members Larsen and Cohen, and
members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear
before you today to highlight the perspective of an airport operator on
securing the future of general aviation (GA). My name is Rick Crider,
and I am the Executive Vice President of Airport/Railport and Military
Relations at Port San Antonio, in San Antonio, Texas.
I am testifying today on behalf of the American Association of
Airport Executives (AAAE), where I serve on the Executive Committee as
Second Vice Chair. AAAE is the world's largest professional
organization for airport executives representing thousands of
individuals who manage and operate more than 850 public-use commercial
and GA airports across the country.
The Impact of General Aviation
Let me begin by thanking this subcommittee and its members for your
steadfast support of GA airports and the broader GA industry. General
aviation is an integral part of our National Airspace System (NAS). In
fact, the U.S. has the largest and most diverse system of GA airports
in the world, supporting more than one million jobs and helping
generate nearly $250 billion in economic impact annually.
There are more than 4,400 public-use GA airports in the United
States, providing communities small and large across the country access
to the nation's air transportation system. While GA facilities are
present and important in every state, I would note that in Vice Ranking
Member Mary Peltola's state of Alaska, 82 percent of communities are
not connected to the road system and are fully dependent on air service
and GA facilities for life, health, and safety needs.
The benefits of GA airports to individuals, businesses, and
communities, as connection points to the nation's air transportation
system, cannot be overstated. While GA airports vary significantly in
size, complexity, and configuration, each provides unique functions and
vital capabilities. In many cases, GA airports are centers for
industrial aerospace activities, training hubs for the next generation
of pilots, and access points to the NAS for businesses in smaller and
rural communities. GA airports serve as incubators for revolutionary
technologies like electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL)
vehicles, and other applications of advanced technologies. Law
enforcement, firefighting, aerospace engineering and manufacturing, air
cargo, agriculture and recreation are other examples of activities that
take place at GA airports every day.
Kelly Field and Workforce Development
My role at Port San Antonio includes the oversight and development
of the civil portions of Kelly Field, a joint use industrial airport in
southwest San Antonio. Kelly Field is home to a vibrant private-sector
maintenance, repair and overhaul campus that supports aircraft ranging
from large commercial transport utilized by the federal government to
military fighter and cargo to new commercial aircraft.
Kelly Field is an industrial airport, as described in recent
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated
Airport Systems (NPIAS) reports, but classified as a GA airport.
Industrial GA airports across the country provide critical services to
aircraft operators, from airlines to corporate flight departments, that
require fleet maintenance, refurbishment, updates, and modifications.
At Kelly Field, these activities, combined with the Air National Guard
and Air Force Reserve pilot training missions, generate over 11,300
jobs and $3.2 billion in annual economic impact throughout San Antonio
and the south Texas region, according to a 2021 report.
Without properly investing in infrastructure and developing an
aviation workforce that meets the demand of industrial aerospace, those
jobs and economic impact are at risk of migrating beyond our borders to
places where excess capacity exists. This scenario could erode the
leadership position our nation holds within the global aerospace
industry. The direct correlation between airport infrastructure and
aerospace commerce through the myriad of parts, components, and labor
utilized is evident every time a new aircraft or an aircraft being
returned to use after heavy maintenance or specialized service leaves
an industrial airport.
Port San Antonio recognizes that the real limiting factor in
industrial aviation growth and program retention is workforce. Ten
months ago, the Port opened a state-of-the-art innovation center that
houses, among other things, an arena for live performances and
seminars, a competition gaming center for students, and an interactive
science and technology museum. The sole focus of this development is to
provide a space for students, specifically the socio-economically
challenged students that reside in the southern areas of San Antonio,
to be exposed to opportunities in the advanced technology realm. Flight
simulators, robotic displays, a town built of Legos to highlight
control systems and vulnerability to cybersecurity threats, a mock
security operations center, and 3D printing present STEM through the
lens of legacy aerospace and emerging industries.
The innovation center is owned by and resides on Port property and
is just a few blocks from Kelly Field. The Port's vision is to excite
and prepare a pipeline of future workers who are enthusiastic and
engaged in the pursuit of technical careers. The 80-plus companies that
call Port San Antonio home use this platform to introduce themselves to
future talent, and in many cases provide internships to help young
people make this transformational journey. We firmly believe that an
effective workforce pipeline is critical to the future of our local
economy, the region, and the continued vitality of the nation's
aerospace and aviation sectors.
FAA Reauthorization Overview
With the current FAA authorization set to expire in less than seven
months, AAAE and Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA)
have crafted a joint list of recommendations that would help GA and
commercial service airports alike. This joint list--which is included
at the conclusion of my testimony--contains various reforms that would
benefit airports as well as the passengers and local communities they
serve.
To help airports of all sizes build critical infrastructure, the
two associations are calling for increasing Airport Improvement Program
(AIP) funding; modifying the AIP formula to benefit both GA and
commercial service airports should additional resources materialize;
eliminating the outdated federal cap on local Passenger Facility
Charges (PFCs); and expanding eligibility for both funding sources.
AAAE and ACI-NA are also urging Congress to reduce federal red tape and
streamline regulations; address noise and other environmental concerns;
preserve and enhance small community air service; and enhance the FAA
Contract Tower Program.
Although travel has largely returned to pre-pandemic levels at both
GA and commercial airports, stakeholders across the aviation system are
still adjusting to the ripple effects caused by the pandemic, including
workforce shortages and significant changes in the distribution of
travel. The next FAA reauthorization bill is an opportunity for this
subcommittee and Congress to address both persistent and newly emerged
challenges, and to help airports and the aviation industry prepare for
the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
Given the importance of the aviation industry to the nation's
economy and the crucial need for certainty and stability for the
aviation system, we commend leaders and members of the subcommittee for
your commitment to pass the FAA reauthorization before programs expire
on September 30. As you know, a series of short-term extensions can
have an adverse impact on airports and make it challenging for them to
move ahead with critical infrastructure projects. With your leadership,
we hope the next FAA bill will be finished on time. I'm sure all of you
agree that the nation's aviation system is simply too important to
operate on autopilot.
Rising Infrastructure Needs
As travel demand continues to rise at GA and commercial service
airports, there is a growing need for infrastructure investment. The
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provided airports with
$20 billion over five years for infrastructure and terminal grants,
with $2.5 billion of that total specifically allotted for nonprimary
commercial service and GA airports. We are grateful for that
investment, which will help airports of all sizes build critical
infrastructure to meet increased demand.
While IIJA funding serves as an important down payment to help
bridge the enormous funding gap for airport infrastructure nationwide
and will help offset inflationary and cost escalation impacts, the need
for additional federal investment remains. According to the FAA's most
recent NPIAS, commercial service and GA airports have $62.4 billion in
AIP and IIJA-eligible projects--or around $12.5 billion annually--over
the next five years. Those totals do not include other non-eligible
infrastructure projects and requirements, which increase total airport
capital needs significantly.
According to the latest NPIAS, the capital needs for nonprimary and
GA airports are more than $19 billion over the next five years. And
that figure does not factor in rising inflation, increasing labor and
construction costs, or supply chain constraints. As members of this
subcommittee know, GA and smaller commercial service airports
disproportionately rely on AIP funding to meet their infrastructure
needs. The combination of stagnant authorization levels for traditional
AIP funding for the past two decades and rising construction costs has
greatly limited these airports from completing critical safety and
improvement projects. As Congress prepares for the next FAA
reauthorization bill, AAAE and ACI-NA are urging Congress to increase
traditional AIP funding to at least $4 billion and to continue to
authorize funds for supplemental discretionary grants to help GA and
commercial service airports meet their ongoing infrastructure needs.
In conjunction with increasing AIP funding, we recommend Congress
provide airports with more flexibility in how they are permitted to use
that funding consistent with provisions in IIJA and in recognition of
evolving airport infrastructure needs and existing limitations.
Additionally, we recommend adjusting the AIP entitlement for nonprimary
airports, including GA airports, since it has remained stagnant at
$150,000 for more than 20 years despite rising costs and infrastructure
needs. The current funding approach for nonprimary entitlements (NPE)
also fails to recognize the dramatic differences in aircraft activity,
operations, and economic impact within the wide spectrum of diverse GA
airports.
The NPIAS categorizes nonprimary airports based on their activity
level as either national, regional, local, or basic. Instead of the
current one-size-fits-all policy, Congress should modernize GA
entitlements by providing increased funding levels to airports with
more activity or that serve larger aircraft. Specifically, we propose a
tiered approach where the GA entitlement be set at $1 million for
national airports, $500,000 for regional airports, $250,000 for local
airports, and $150,000 for basic airports. It is important to note that
our recommendation for this proposed formula change is contingent upon
AIP funding of at least $4 billion annually.
The need for adjusting the $150,000 nonprimary entitlement is
evident at Kelly Field, where design is underway for a consolidated
facility that will promote eVTOL, along with other new and existing
aircraft. But the investment in infrastructure required far surpasses
the abilities of today's NPE formula. Notably, other GA airports are on
the forefront of efforts to develop, test, and build electric and
second-generation supersonic passenger aircraft.
Kelly Field is proud to support the very smallest of aircraft that
operate today, but it also serves the very largest. Wide body aircraft
operate from Kelly Field daily, requiring Airplane Design Group (ADG) V
and VI infrastructure rather than ADG I or II prevalent at many GA
airports that receive the same nonprimary entitlement. We need
additional resources for a new taxiway and apron complex associated
with a new terminal and hangars. Additional resources are also needed
to expand our public aircraft parking apron used by industrial aviation
activities and designed for ADG VI aircraft. Additional investment in
GA airports will support the wide range of aircraft that operate today,
but it will also stimulate the fertile ground of applied technology and
allow the private sector to make the next leaps in aerospace
advancement at Kelly Field and at other airports across the NAS.
Regulatory Reform
Airports need help cutting through unnecessary red tape and
regulatory burdens imposed by the FAA that are time-consuming, delay
critical infrastructure projects, and unnecessarily increase costs. As
inherently public institutions with a primary goal of serving
communities and travelers, airports have every incentive to use federal
and local dollars responsibly and to pursue important policy objectives
without the need for heavy-handed federal regulation.
Congress can help by directing the FAA to correct their
misinterpretation of the airport land use streamlining provisions
(Section 163) included in the last FAA bill, which has resulted in
overly burdensome processes and inhibited airport development.
Commercial service airports should not be required to submit PFC
applications for AIP projects already approved by the FAA, and we urge
Congress to reject any proposals that would impose additional
unnecessary grant assurances on GA and commercial service airports,
which lead to costly, unfunded federal mandates that impede the
delivery of critical infrastructure projects.
Leaded Avgas
Like our counterparts at commercial service airports, GA airports
strive to be strong environmental stewards for their community. For
decades, the GA industry has been focused on a smart and safe
transition toward an unleaded high-octane fuel that meets the needs of
the entire GA fleet. So far, only low-compression engines can burn the
unleaded fuels that are currently available, and 75 percent of the
total GA aviation gas (avgas) consumption is by aircraft requiring 100-
octane fuel, which presently can only be achieved with a lead-based
additive.
Through AAAE, GA airports are participating in the Eliminate
Aviation Gasoline Lead Emissions (EAGLE) initiative, a public-private
partnership between the federal government and industry stakeholders to
transition to lead-free avgas for piston-engine aircraft by the end of
2030. Like the blender's tax credit for sustainable aviation fuels, we
believe similar incentives to scale up the production and distribution
of these new GA fuels will be critical to a successful transition.
GA airports are eager to be part of the solution for transitioning
away from leaded avgas and await a better understanding of what types
of infrastructure improvements are needed to support the widespread use
of the new fuel. Updated AIP eligibility criteria for new storage and
distribution systems at GA airports will likely be needed, but a
premature ban of leaded avgas before a viable replacement is approved
will threaten the economic viability of most GA airports and should be
rejected.
PFAS
Since the 1970s, FAA has required Part 139 commercial service
airports to provide aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) services
using aqueous film forming foams (AFFF) that meet specific standards
for firefighting. These approved foams contain PFAS. Many GA airports
have relied upon and follow FAA guidance in using AFFF to ensure
aviation safety, and like Part 139 airports GA airports, are anxiously
awaiting the FAA to approve a fluorine-free foam (F3).
On January 12, the Department of Defense (DOD) and U.S. Navy
released new performance standards for F3 fire-extinguishing agents, a
significant milestone that is expected to ultimately allow airports to
transition away from AFFF agents beginning later this year. However,
there are still unanswered questions regarding supply chain
constraints, standards and practices to decontaminate ARFF equipment,
and new firefighting training, which could delay airports' ability to
transition. That is why Congress, as part of the explanatory statement
accompanying the FY23 omnibus appropriations bill, directed the FAA, in
coordination with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and DOD, to
develop a transition plan within 120 days to provide airports with the
necessary guidance to ensure an orderly and cost-effective transition
over the next few years.
EPA could take future regulatory action that might impede a
successful transition and lead to substantial financial costs for
airports. This year, EPA is expected to issue a final rule designating
two PFAS chemicals, PFOA and PFOS, as ``hazardous substances'' under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act (CERCLA). For airports, which have used AFFF in accordance with
federal law and the interest of public safety for decades, such a
designation could trigger potentially costly litigation and cleanup
efforts to address PFOA and/or PFOS-related contamination.
While the FAA is moving closer to approving an F3 agent, most, if
not all airports, will still be using AFFF for the next several years
because there are many factors and challenges in making an industry-
wide transition, such as the lack of transition-related guidance from
the federal government and supply constraints. A final rule from EPA,
before the industry is prepared to transition, would be a draconian
measure that puts airports in an especially untenable position of using
a designated hazardous substance in an emergency situation in
accordance with federal law.
We urge Congress to acknowledge the longstanding federal
requirement for airports to use AFFF by providing liability protection,
including CERCLA liability protection, for airports. This sensible
request isn't new; in fact, the PFAS Action Act, which the House passed
in the last two Congresses, included CERCLA liability exemption for
airports. However, both efforts ultimately stalled in the Senate.
Additional funding will be needed to help airports procure the new F3s,
dispose of their old AFFF, and clean up any potential PFAS
contamination. These steps, coupled with much-needed guidance from the
FAA and EPA, will help the airport community transition quicker to a
PFAS-free future.
FAA Contract Tower Program
I would like to thank the leadership and members of this
subcommittee for being strong supporters of the FAA Contract Tower
(FCT) Program--a successful public-private partnership that enhances
aviation safety at GA and commercial service airports around the
country. The FCT program encompasses 262 airports in 46 states,
including 24 in Texas. The program has been audited numerous times by
the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General, which has
consistently validated that contract towers are cost-effective and
maintain safety records comparable to FAA-staffed towers.
The IIJA included at least $300 million over five years to repair,
replace, or relocate aging air traffic control towers at FCT airports--
$100 million for sponsor-owned facilities and $200 million for FAA-
owned facilities. Many air traffic control towers are 50 years of age
or older, so this funding is a welcome step in the right direction.
However, with the most modest control towers costing $10 million or
more to construct, we urge Congress to provide additional resources to
address outdated facilities that are in desperate need of repair or
replacement.
We also call on Congress to require the FAA to deploy radar
displays, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast displays, and
other technology at contract towers to increase situational awareness
for air traffic controllers. Contract tower controllers should have
access to the same technology advances and equipment used at FAA-
staffed facilities. These actions would ensure that contract towers
continue to operate safely and have information that is consistent with
FAA towers, as air traffic operations continue to rise.
The pilot shortage has understandably received a great deal of
attention but we're facing an increasing shortage of air traffic
controllers as well. The companies that operate contract towers are
experiencing intensifying staffing pressures brought upon by COVID-19,
the rising cost of living, and frequent vacancies created when younger
controllers leave their positions at FCT airports to serve at FAA-
staffed towers.
The CONTRACT Act, which Congress passed as part of the FY23 omnibus
appropriations bill, will certainly help by removing a disincentive for
retired FAA controllers to continue serving at contract tower airports.
We thank Rep. Julia Brownley (D-CA) and other members of this committee
for their work in getting that bill enacted into law. We encourage the
FAA to work with the companies that operate contract towers to allow
innovative hiring and training processes to increase the stream of
applicants to be qualified controllers.
We also recommend that the FAA collaborate with the Department of
Labor to address the rising cost of living for controllers, by updating
the outdated wage determination that has failed to keep up with
inflation. It is important that the FAA work with contractors and
minimize the adverse impact when the agency hires controllers from
contract towers for FAA-staffed facilities. Further, we recommend that
the FAA carefully consider how any proposed realignment of service
areas could impact the successful FCT program.
Advanced Air Mobility
The future of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is quickly becoming the
present for the aviation industry, with several companies currently
developing eVTOL aircraft. These aircraft, which will range in size
from single-passenger aircraft to large shuttles, will bring
accessibility to cities, underserved communities, and geographically
distant regions, while offering immense environmental advantages.
Existing infrastructure, at GA airports in particular, will likely play
a major role in this new AAM ecosystem.
Airports are excited to help make AAM a reality, though there are a
few issues that Congress and FAA must ultimately address to set AAM up
for success. To accommodate widespread use of eVTOL aircraft in the
future, airports will need significantly greater electrical
infrastructure and grid capacity to support the charging requirements
of these new vehicles. This will require dedicated funding outside of
the regular AIP program to ensure that airports are not sacrificing
funding for critical safety projects and infrastructure modernization.
Additionally, Congress must ensure that new entrants pay their fair
share for the costs of air traffic control services, FAA resources, and
infrastructure needed to accommodate their operations.
Conclusion
GA airports like Kelly Field are complex aviation centers, acting
as national assets that play an indispensable role in meeting the
unique needs of the communities they serve. I am grateful for the
opportunity to provide these views of the GA airport community, on how
we can maintain and grow GA operations across the country and offer
suggestions on how to better position airports to meet current and
future challenges and opportunities as part of FAA reauthorization
legislation. Thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to
testify.

American Association of Airport Executives
Airport Industry Policy Recommendations
january 2023
Infrastructure
Airport Improvement Program

Increase the authorized funding levels to a minimum of $4
billion annually.

Extend AIP eligibility to all activities allowed under
the PFC program, as in the bipartisan infrastructure law, and require
that FAA adjust its programmatic funding priorities to take the new
eligibility into account.

Authorize supplemental discretionary AIP funding and
allow airports to use funds for more terminal projects and other PFC-
eligible projects.

Rebalance funding allocations by reducing the percentage
of AIP entitlements large hub and medium hub airports with $4.50 PFC
turn back to the program and then replenishing the Small Airports Fund
with a commensurate amount of funding. The proposed formula change is
contingent upon AIP funding of at least $4 billion annually.

Provide additional funding for small hub and non-hub
airports.

Remove the $20 million cap on the amount of discretionary
funds allowed in terminal projects at non-hubs and some small hub
airports.

Modernize GA entitlements by providing increased funding
levels to airports with more activity ($1 million for national
airports, $500,000 for commercial-service non-primary airports,
$500,000 for regional airports, $250,000 for local airports, $150,000
for basic airports, and $0 for unclassified airports.) The proposed
formula change is contingent upon AIP funding of at least $4 billion
annually.

Require the FAA to distribute AIP funding as quickly as
possible and with as much flexibility as possible, in part by allowing
airports to report on their usage of the funds for eligible activities,
rather than directing airports on the agency's preferred use of the
funds.

Establish pilot program for the FAA to begin
accommodating alternative-delivery and advance-construction methods
that can expedite projects and reduce costs.

Continue using Calendar Year 2019 enplanement figures (or
current year figures, whichever is higher) to determine AIP entitlement
apportionments for two additional years beyond Fiscal Year 2023.

Support continued funding for ACRP.

Passenger Facility Charges

Eliminate the federal cap on local PFC user fees.

Extend PFC eligibility to include any lawful capital cost
of the airport.

Eliminate PFC exemptions for non-revenue passengers.

Fully implement the PFC streamlining provision (Section
121) included in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which expands to
all-size airports a streamlined process for imposing/using PFCs, as
previously provided only to non-hub airports.

Eliminate PFC application requirement when airports use
PFCs for local match on AIP-approved projects.

Bag Fees

Include airline bag fees in the domestic passenger ticket
tax that helps fund the Airport and Airway Trust Fund.
Regulatory Reform

Accelerate airport land use development by directing FAA
to fully implement Section 163.

Remove costly hurdles to implementation of Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law:
+  DOT should reinstate a nationwide waiver for new Buy America
provisions until at least 180-days after the FAA issues airport-
specific guidance on implementation and a sound assessment of supply
chains and product/material availability in the United States is made.
+  Since airports are involved in complex, multifaceted
construction programs with a mix of federal, local, and private
resources, there should be an exemption for airports to the
applicability of Buy America to the entirety of a project. It is
federal overreach to apply federal procurement law to a project or
portion of a project funded with an airport's own resources.
+  Direct the FAA to accommodate alternative-delivery and
advance-construction methods that can expedite and reduce costs for
projects using federal funds, especially for projects already underway
at many airports.

Protect airports in Safety Management System
implementation:
+  Provide liability protection for those airport personnel
designated as responsible for SMS implementation.
+  Provide airports with public disclosure protection for the
safety-related data generated as part of their SMS programs.

Set a 45-day deadline for FAA to approve NEPA purpose-
and-need statements.

Extend the eligibility date for the TIFIA for Airports
provisions to align with the authorization date of the new FAA
reauthorization bill.

Avoid the imposition of additional grant assurances on
airports.
Environmental Issues
PFAS Firefighting Foam

Direct the FAA, in collaboration with industry
stakeholders, to develop a national transition plan to assist airports
in moving to fluorine-free firefighting foams.

Provide federal funds for an acquisition program for the
new foam, a disposal program for the old foam, and PFAS remediation at
airports.

As the EPA continues to pursue plans to designate PFAS as
hazardous materials, Congress should acknowledge the longstanding
federal requirement on airports to use this firefighting foam by
providing liability protection to airports, including CERCLA liability
protection.

Voluntary Airport Low Emissions Program

Expand eligibility to include all airports, including
those outside of non-attainment areas, to enable efforts towards
meeting Net Zero commitments.

Broaden the program to address overall greenhouse gas
emissions.

Allow the program to include actions taken as part of a
State Implementation Plan or Federal Clean Air Act requirement.

Incorporate energy management and renewable energy
projects where emissions reductions occur at a utility, rather than an
airport.

Resiliency/Sustainability

Provide separate, dedicated general funds (est. $1
billion annually) for projects eligible the under Voluntary Airport Low
Emissions Program; Airport Zero Emissions Vehicle and Infrastructure
Pilot Program; noise mitigation (such as public education programs and
sound insulation); sustainability; resiliency projects and planning;
and installation of electric charging stations.

Establish funding program to support planning and
development of electric capability and resiliency projects at airports.

Direct FAA to work with NOAA and US Army Corps of
Engineers on resiliency initiatives for coastal airports.

Noise

Direct FAA to update Part 150 noise standards to reflect
all relevant laws and regulations.

Require FAA to help reduce impact of aircraft noise on
local communities by: 1) implementing flight procedures that can
attenuate aircraft noise; 2) working with airports on arrival and
departure routes; and 3) discouraging local encroachment that could
create future noise challenges and impact airport operations and
aviation safety.

Direct the FAA to clarify future noise policy/standards
and seek feedback from airports and their stakeholders before
implementing any changes per the recently conducted Neighborhood
Environmental Survey that could affect airport operations.

Direct FAA to evaluate the community impact of noise from
AAM and UAS integration into the NAS, and not hold airports responsible
for noise resulting from AAM and UAS operations not associated with
airport operations.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Establish funding program for planning and development of
appropriate SAF infrastructure at airports, which will help promote
greater SAF availability at airports as SAF production, transportation,
blending, and storage needs increase.
Small Community Air Service/Workforce

Modernize and maintain funding for the Essential Air
Service Program.

Enhance the Small Community Air Service Development
Program:
+  Increase funding to at least $20 million annually.
+  Allow communities to receive multiple grants for the same
purpose.

Support the Contract Tower Program:
+  Provide incentives for retired federal controllers to continue
working at contract towers.
+  Require FAA and Labor Department to review the outdated wage
determinations for contract tower controllers.
+  Provide funds to install radar displays and other ATC
equipment at contract tower facilities.

Take steps to address the pilot and aviation workforce
shortage, such as: 1) increasing federal student loan aid for pilot
training; and 2) extending and increasing funding for Aviation
Workforce Development Grants to $10 million annually.
FAA Facilities and Equipment/Operations

Require the FAA to work with airports, aviation
stakeholders, and TSA to ensure (1) new entrants are safely integrated
into the National Airspace System, and (2) airports are protected from
unsafe UAS activities.

Ensure new entrants pay their fair share for the costs of
ATC services and infrastructure needed to accommodate their operations.

Increase funding for ATC towers and equipment.

Expand the Remote Tower Pilot Program.

Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Crider.
Mr. Curt Castagna, president and CEO of the National Air
Transportation Association, you are recognized for 5 minutes
for your testimony.

TESTIMONY OF CURT CASTAGNA, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, NATIONAL AIR TRANSPORTATION ASSOCIATION

Mr. Castagna. Chairs Graves and Graves, Ranking Members
Larsen and Cohen, and distinguished members of the Aviation
Subcommittee, as president and CEO of the National Air
Transportation Association and as an aviation business owner, I
appreciate the opportunity to offer solution-based testimony
today drawn from member input.
I am pleased to join the other members of today's panel in
advocating for a healthy general aviation ecosystem that
supports collaborative partnerships between airports, aviation
businesses, airport users, and local communities consistent
with FAA policy, airport access, and self-sustainability.
As the voice of aviation business for more than 83 years,
NATA represents a vital transportation industry that employs
over 1 million individuals, creates $247 billion in economic
output, and provides critical access to aeromedical emergency
services, rescue, cargo, and on-demand passenger service to
countless communities. Our 3,700 member locations include
fixed-based operators, air charter providers, maintenance
repair stations, and flight schools, as well as more than 300
general aviation airports. Collectively, NATA members serve the
general public, recreational pilots, business aviation,
airlines, and the military.
Today's hearing comes at a critical juncture for both
general aviation industry, which is experiencing high activity
levels and rapid innovation in aircraft design, safety, and
alternative fuel sources, and, as well, the FAA, which provides
critical regulatory oversight of our industry. NATA appreciates
the many competent, collaborative, and committed FAA leaders we
work with on a daily basis.
However, we also recognize the current antiquated systems
hinder the agency's ability to perform timely certification,
rulemaking, and oversight duties. The on-demand charter
industry offers a perfect example. With 680 new certification
requests currently in the FAA's backlog, it takes up to 2 years
to secure a part 135 certificate under the existing process.
Adding a new aircraft to an existing certificate also takes up
to 1 year, even when that aircraft has been subject to ongoing
FAA conformity. Lastly, part 135 operators cannot secure timely
checks with FAA inspectors, and struggle to get their own check
pilots approved, which compounds our acute workforce shortage.
Congress can legislate solutions for these problems by
mandating FAA industry working groups, digitize processes and
online dashboards, expanded use of third-party evaluators and
carrier checks, and, in some cases, just simple implementation
of existing FAA policy.
We also encourage Congress to address the needs of general
aviation airports to modernize infrastructure, prepare for
advanced air mobility, and increase sustainability. As my
colleague Mr. Crider mentioned, the $150,000 AIP entitlement
for GA airports has remained stagnant for over 20 years, and
rising inflation and soaring construction costs make that
current entitlement not very effective. We ask Congress to
increase the GA entitlement and to adopt a tiered funding
formula based on flight activity to account for the diversity
of size and needs of GA airports.
As the industry grapples with dangerous PFAS chemicals in
airport rescue trucks and hangar foam fire systems, we seek
Federal guidance and assistance on a transition away from
fluorinated foams, an exemption from PFAS-related litigation
for airports, and, as well, aircraft hangar owners that have
been subject to those regulations.
NATA is committed to removing lead from avgas. We support
funding to accelerate testing and approval for unleaded fuel
that meets the requirements of the entire piston fleet, as well
as the investments in infrastructure now to make the existing
unleaded fuel more widely available. We must take creative
steps now for the adoption of alternative unleaded fuels,
increasing their commercial availability and expanding
infrastructure to accommodate them. For example, short-term tax
credits for refiners, blenders, and distributors of approved
unleaded fuel would incentivize production and accelerate
deployment, much as in the case of SAFs.
Advanced air mobility holds enormous promise to reduce
aircraft emissions, enhance cargo and medical transport in
rural areas, and facilitate urban mobility. NATA sees a natural
nexus between existing part 135 operators, general aviation
airports, FBOs, and the AAM innovation. Both urban and rural
general aviation airports offer ideal spaces to introduce eVTOL
technology, and NATA members are preparing to support and
maintain this next generation of aircraft.
Lastly, we ask Congress to help our industry efforts to
recruit a diverse and resilient workforce by expanding section
625 grants, extending Federal loan programs to aspiring pilots
and aircraft mechanics, and broadening the on-ramp to
nontraditional technical jobs with new grants targeting other
aviation workforce sectors.
Thank you for your opportunity to testify on behalf of
aviation businesses, and I look forward to your questions.
[Mr. Castagna's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Curt Castagna, President and Chief Executive
Officer, National Air Transportation Association
Committee Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, Subcommittee
Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Cohen, and distinguished Members of
the Aviation Subcommittee:
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the National
Air Transportation Association (NATA) and its nearly 3,700 aviation
business members. Of critical importance to the future of the general
aviation industry is FAA Reauthorization legislation that will maintain
the security and increase the resiliency of our National Airspace
System while refining the focus and improving the efficiency of its
regulatory agency. I deeply appreciate the Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee's commitment to a timely, comprehensive, and
bipartisan reauthorization process, and offer sincere thanks to
Committee Chairman Sam Graves for his decision to include the first-
ever general aviation title in the 2023 bill.
To support that effort, I am pleased to offer solution-focused
testimony that reflects the direct input of NATA's membership and the
recommendations of our member-driven policy committees, which convene
thought-provoking industry leaders, examine contemporary issues, and
pursue solutions to prioritize the safety and economic viability of our
industry.
For more than 80 years, NATA has been the voice of aviation
business. Our advocacy began in 1940, when the threat of war put
general aviation in the United States at risk. As the U.S. Army sought
to ban all flights by privately owned aircraft, 83 charter members
representing all types of general aviation businesses united as a
singular voice to successfully ask Congress and the Administration to
keep the airspace open to this important industry.
Today, NATA continues to advocate for a broad cross-section of the
general and business aviation industry, including fixed base operators
(FBOs), part 135 on-demand air carriers, part 145 maintenance repair
stations (MROs), aviation fuel producers and suppliers, flight schools,
air medical operators, and airport sponsors at general aviation
airports. I will briefly explain the function and impact of each of
these general aviation industry segments.
Fixed Base Operators
Fixed base operators (FBOs), as the primary service and fuel
providers to general aviation aircraft operators, provide mission-
critical support and infrastructure to general aviation as well as to
many essential public services including law enforcement, EMS, fire
management, military, and National Guard units. FBOs often provide
private general aviation passenger and customer service terminals; line
service, such as aircraft parking, fueling, tie-down, and hangar space;
technical services, such as airframe and engine maintenance; aircraft
rentals, charters, management and/or sales; flight instruction;
aircraft catering; ground transportation and parking; and amenities for
pilots, passengers, and crew. In addition, FBOs at many commercial
airports perform line maintenance, cabin cleaning, and baggage handling
for part 121 commercial, passenger, and cargo airline customers. NATA's
FBO members range in size from single-location small businesses to
regional, national, and international chains. In total, the domestic
FBO industry includes nearly 3,000 business locations operating under
lease with airport authorities around the country.
Part 135 On-Demand Air Charter
One of the most critical contributions of general aviation is
providing on-demand transportation for freight and passengers,
especially to communities that have no scheduled commercial air carrier
service. Most operators using general aviation aircraft in a for-hire
passenger and/or cargo capacity are certificated to operate under Title
14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 and conduct
numerous types of missions, including governmental, business, and
recreational travel, as well as medical flights and disaster relief.
NATA's air charter members regularly transport organ transplant
surgical teams; private charter often offers the only transportation
solution in such cases because of the short window of time to move
organs from donor to recipient. The majority of NATA's air charter
members are small businesses operating a range of aircraft from large
turbo-powered business jets to small, single-engine piston-powered
airplanes and helicopters. In total, nearly 2,000 FAA-certified charter
operators operate in all 50 states and U.S. Territories.
Part 145 Maintenance/Repair Stations
The term ``repair station'' refers to a maintenance facility that
has been issued an FAA certificate under 14 CFR Part 145 and engages in
the maintenance, preventive maintenance, inspection, and alteration of
aircraft and aircraft products. Another more general term used
throughout the industry is MRO, referring to repair stations as
maintenance, repair, and overhaul facilities. FAA certified repair
stations receive class ratings under the categories of airframe,
powerplant, propeller, radio, instrument, and accessory. At last count,
there were approximately 5,000 FAA-certified repair stations located
domestically and abroad.
General Aviation Fuel Suppliers
NATA represents all of the nation's major general aviation fuel
suppliers who provide aviation businesses with Jet A, Avgas, refueler
trucks, financing for fuel infrastructure, contract fuel,
sustainability programs, and other logistical services. NATA's fuel
members include domestic producers of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)
and alternative unleaded fuel.
Flight Training
In the U.S., flight training is provided under three different sets
of regulations: 14 CFR Part 61, 141, and 142. Part 61 training is often
provided by individual, for-hire flight instructors, as well as some
flight schools and FBOs. The curriculum is flexible and can be tailored
to a student's specific needs, such as the amount of time he or she can
devote to training. In contrast, Part 141/142 certification mandates
the use of a detailed, FAA-approved course outline, with students
meeting specific performance standards. Across the country, accredited
colleges and universities integrate flight training curriculums under
14 CFR 141 into the academic requirements for a degree in aviation
science, catering to the full-time flight student who desires a
structured training regimen. Together, these flight programs are
educating and training the next generation of aircraft operators for
both general and commercial aviation.
Aeromedical Services
Approximately 250 organizations in the U.S. are currently engaged
in the transport of seriously ill or injured people to hospitals for
emergency care. Air medical transport saves lives by bringing more
medical capabilities to the patient than are normally provided by
ground emergency medical services, along with faster transit times to
the appropriate specialty care location--services not typically
provided by commercial air carriers. These operators also support door-
to-door service for organ transplant teams utilizing both helicopters
and fixed wing aircraft.
General Aviation Airports
One of NATA's fastest-growing membership categories is that of
general aviation airports. Our nation's 4,500 general aviation airports
are vital economic engines, serving as arrival and departure points for
economic developers; supporting agricultural, law enforcement, and
fire-fighting missions; and providing access to critical medical care,
especially in remote communities. By contrast, scheduled air carriers
fly only to those places where the economics of operation justify
service, approximately 500 airports nationally. The FAA defines general
aviation airports as public-use airports that do not have scheduled
service or have less than 2,500 annual passenger boardings. General
aviation airports vary greatly in scope and complexity of operations,
from single-runway airstrips with little infrastructure to larger
airports supporting more operations than some primary commercial
airports. Regardless of size, however, they all provide a vital
lifeline to communities across the country, driving local economies and
supporting essential services.
General Aviation Industry
Together, NATA's diverse member businesses form a critical portion
of the general aviation industry, which supports 1.2 million jobs;
provides over $247 billion in economic output in the United States
alone; and contributes to the nation's competitiveness, growth, and
continued innovation. The title of today's hearing, ``Securing the
Future of General Aviation,'' is particularly apt for the current state
of our vital industry, as record-high activity levels coupled with
rapid innovation in aircraft design, safety systems, and alternative
fuel sources signal an ever evolving, ever growing, and ever relevant
general aviation sector.
The task before this Subcommittee--to craft legislation updating
and modernizing the Federal Aviation Administration--comes at a
critical juncture for both the Agency and the industry it regulates.
U.S. aviation continues to set the gold standard for safety and
efficiency, but evidence of FAA inefficiency and inconsistency is
growing even as the aviation industry experiences unprecedented growth
and innovation, with the next generation of aircraft and fuels around
the corner.
FAA Certification and Oversight
I want to begin by expressing NATA's appreciation of the existing
FAA workforce. Tasked with maintaining the gold standard of aviation
safety for the world's most complex airspace system, the Agency
presides over almost every facet of the general aviation industry. NATA
finds FAA leaders at all levels within the organization to be
competent, committed, and collaborative, yet the Agency's understaffed
workforce is shackled by antiquated methods and lack of permanent
leadership in key positions. The resulting backlogs of critical FAA
certification, rulemaking, and oversight functions is evidence that the
Agency struggles to meet current industry needs, much less prepare for
the growth emerging technologies will bring in the coming years.
I expect all of the members of today's distinguished panel will
testify to ways that their respective memberships have been impacted by
FAA's inefficient processing of its basic functions for the general
aviation industry; I will focus on its effect on NATA's part 135 on-
demand charter members.
Part 135 Certification Process
Prospective entrants to the on-demand air charter industry must
complete a five-phase certification process, beginning with a pre-
application stage that utilizes the Certification Service Oversight
Process (CSOP) to determine FAA resources for initial certification and
continued oversight of the prospective operator. Applications are
either assigned to a certification team or placed on a waiting list.
Currently, that CSOP queue contains approximately 680 new
certificate applications--a number that has tripled over just the past
twelve months. Even without this current backlog, completion of the
four remaining phases can take an applicant up to two years, deterring
new industry entrants and increasing the risk of dangerous, illegal
charter activity.
This process, based on an outdated, inefficient principles lacking
in transparency, results in an unnecessarily costly and lengthy
experience for applicants seeking legal entrance to the regulated on-
demand charter industry. Inconsistencies among Flight Standard District
Offices (FSDOs) and the current allocation procedures for the regional
FAA workforce further exacerbate the problem. We are concerned that
with the rapid pace of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) development, the
demands for 135 certification and oversight will only continue to grow.
To ensure U.S. global leadership in this emerging sector while
maintaining the economic viability of the air charter sector, FAA must
modernize its processes.
To facilitate, NATA asks Congress to mandate a collaborative FAA/
industry working group to study methods for modernizing the part 135
certification process and to recommend long-term solutions for
effective management of FAA resources. This working group should
consider technological advancements to enhance efficiency,
certification process benchmarks and timelines for both FAA and
applicants, centralized management of FAA inspectors, and use of
designee authority.
In the meantime, the FAA should provide immediate transparency to
Congress and industry on the current certification backlog, allocation
of FAA resources, and expected time to process all pending applicants.
NATA believes an online certification dashboard would provide this
increased transparency and could be easily implemented. In addition to
making public the total number of applicants in the CSOP queue, de-
identified data for each applicant should include certification
category, start and completion date for each certification stage, and
FAA resources assigned.
Part 135 Check Pilot Functions
Once certified, regulations require all part 135 on-demand carriers
to have sufficient qualified instructors and check pilots approved by
the FAA to meet the training and checking needs of the carrier's
pilots.\1\ For operators with sufficient staff to perform checks
themselves in accordance with existing regulatory requirements, the FAA
has issued guidance to inspectors and operators to encourage the
approval of more carrier check pilots. Only when the carrier lacks
adequate resources should the FAA be required to provide these checks.
Despite this, significant gaps persist in ensuring timely checks for
air charter pilots, in particular completion of the pilot line check
required by Sec.  135.299.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ See 14 CFR Sec.  135.323 (a)(4)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
One challenge is that the FAA imposes higher qualification
requirements for a carrier's check pilots than it does for FAA
inspectors conducting the same checks.\2\ If the FAA standards, which
presumably provide an acceptable level of safety, were applied to
industry check pilots, many more carriers could provide their own line
checks as the regulations intend. This would free up FAA workforce to
attend to other duties and to assist smaller operators. Yet there also
seems to be a persistent reluctance of local inspectors to approve
qualified carrier personnel as check pilots--even when those carrier
pilots meet the more stringent standards for industry check pilots.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Carrier check pilots are individually authorized by local FAA
inspectors and meet requirements of Sec. Sec.  135.337 & 135.339. FAA
Order 8900.1, Volume 1, Chapter 3, Section 6, Figure 1-2, Item 12,
Operations Inspector Qualifications and Currency Requirements Matrix,
provides FAA inspector qualifications.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2020, NATA petitioned the FAA to revise applicable regulations
to align qualifications for carrier check pilots more closely with the
qualifications required for FAA personnel providing checks.\3\ The FAA
has not acted upon that petition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ See https://www.regulations.gov/document/FAA-2020-0556-0001
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependency on the FAA for pilot checking tasks causes undue delays
for operators waiting for an available inspector, diverts Agency
resources away from other safety oversight tasks, and increases FAA
costs as inspectors travel to the carrier to perform the check. The
smallest of carriers, who by size are necessarily dependent upon FAA
for checks, are subject to further unreasonable delays while the FAA
workforce provides checks for larger carriers that are otherwise able
and willing to supply their own check pilots.
NATA believes a Congressional directive could alleviate this
problem by requiring FAA to engage with stakeholders, evaluate why
check pilot approval continues to lag, and determine further actions to
increase the number of carrier check pilots. This engagement could be a
separate working group, an additional tasking for an existing
rulemaking committee, or another appropriate assembly assigned to
report recommendations back to the Agency.
The FAA should specifically review why it has different
qualification standards for FAA inspectors than for carrier check
pilots. In addition, it should consider information in the NATA
petition for rulemaking as well as the recommendations provided by
prior rulemaking committees such as the Part 135/125 Aviation
Rulemaking Committee (ARC), the Flight Crew Member Training Hours
Requirement Review ARC, and the Air Carrier Training ARC.
Part 135 Aircraft Conformity
In addition to backlogs related to certification and check pilot
functions, NATA members also report difficulties and delays in adding
new aircraft to existing certificates due to varied workloads at local
FSDOs and inconsistent interpretations of FAA regulations and
directives by Principal Inspectors. This problem will only become more
acute when the current CSOP backlog of approximately 680 pending new
carrier certifications breaks and the expected flood of new entrants
from emerging technologies, such as electric vertical take-off and
landing vehicles (eVTOL) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), become
operational. The FAA must adjust its policy to provide timely oversight
on an ever-expanding and increasingly complex industry.
First, FAA regulations do not require aircraft configuration
evaluation to be carried out by the Agency. These functions can--and
should--be carried out in partnership between certified entities and
local FSDOs in a manner that is efficient, timely, and consistent
throughout the country. Policies can be adopted to enable carriers or
third-party evaluators to certify the conformity of an aircraft being
added to a certificate--a process that will relieve the Agency of
quality assurance checks and refocus the FAA workforce on its legally
mandated oversight duties.
In addition, aircraft often move from one part 135 carrier to
another at the aircraft owner's discretion. Even if the aircraft has
continuously been on a part 135 carrier's certificate and subject to
Agency oversight, this process currently requires a full conformity
review, resulting in unnecessary delays prior to the aircraft being
used in service by the new carrier. An NATA member recently spent ten
months attempting to add a new aircraft to its certificate--ten months
that the aircraft was grounded for no reason other than regulatory red
tape. Establishing policy honoring the previously accepted aircraft
configuration evaluation would eliminate needlessly repetitive
functions and, once again, free inspectors to perform necessary safety
oversight. Best of all, NATA believe this policy change would not
necessitate rulemaking.
General Aviation Airports
NATA's member businesses operate at nearly 4,500 airports that
support vital economic activity and connectivity in thousands of
communities, many of which are not served by commercial aviation. In
addition, our association represents nearly 300 general aviation
airports, including more than 100 airport-sponsored FBOs. Although
these general aviation airports vary in their complexity and frequency
of flight operations, together with associated aviation businesses they
support law enforcement and emergency services; non-emergency medical
and organ transport; executive, recreational, and cargo transport;
vocational and aeronautical schools; powerline and pipeline patrol; and
agricultural and conservation efforts.
In addition, general aviation airports will be the first to
implement Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) operations in both urban and
rural areas, making it even more critical that Reauthorization
legislation prioritizes the ongoing maintenance and urgent
modernization of GA airport infrastructure. Our nation's general
aviation airports require both federal investment and increased public/
private partnership opportunities to meet current demands, create more
high-skilled and high-paying jobs, and advance innovative aviation
technology.
Airport Improvement Program Funding
Currently, the general aviation airport annual entitlement under
the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) is $150,000--a figure that has
remained stagnant for decades despite increased activity, rapid
industry innovation, and inevitable inflation. Although the federal
cost share of qualifying projects for non-primary entitlements is set
at 90-95 percent and qualifying airports may stack AIP grands for four
years, rising inflation and the soaring cost of construction make these
funds insufficient for many urgent airport improvement projects.
Furthermore, the non-primary entitlement fails to account for the
diversity in size and needs of general aviation airport operations.
Much in our industry has changed since Congress set the $150,000
basic AIP entitlement more than twenty years ago. It is time for this
Congress to take action to not only account for inflation but also for
the changing needs of general aviation airports by adjusting the basic
entitlement for all GA airports and by introducing a formula to further
increase grants for larger GA airports based on flight activity. In
addition, Congressional action to increase the federal cost share to
100 percent and extend entitlement grant expiration to four years would
allow airports to amass more funding for eligible projects and assist
the smallest GA airports that struggle to come up with matching funds.
PFAS at General Aviation Airports
Another challenge facing airports across the country is the
presence of ``forever chemicals.'' FAA regulations have long required
part 139 certified airports to provide aircraft rescue and firefighting
(ARFF) services utilizing aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) that
contains per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) chemicals, even as
the Environmental Protection Agency has taken steps to designate such
substances as hazardous under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). Historically, many
non-part 139 general aviation airports have voluntarily adopted FAA
policies regarding AFFF, looking toward the Agency's regulations as
safety best practices.
Furthermore, until last year, the National Fire Protection
Association (NFPA) 409: Standard on Aircraft Hangars--the primary
standard for hangar fire protection that is referenced by the
international building code; the international fire code; and state and
local statutes, ordinances, and regulations--required most modern
general aviation hangars to maintain automatic foam fire suppression
systems, many of which utilized fire-fighting foams containing PFAS
chemicals. The presence of these foam systems on airport property
represents a risk to all stakeholders--airport sponsors and aviation
businesses alike.
NATA's work in this area includes educating local authorities on
alternative fire suppression methods and advocating for building
requirements that accurately reflect the low risk of fuel fires in
aircraft hangars, the propensity for costly accidental discharges of
foam fire suppression systems, and the harmful environmental impact of
such occurrences. Because of NATA's efforts, the latest edition of NFPA
409 incorporated some of the Association's proposed changes, providing
aviation businesses with more tools to protect against fire without the
use of foam systems.
But these efforts are not enough. NATA needs Congress to partner
with airports and aviation businesses by requiring federal guidance on
a transition away from fluorinated foams as well as protection from
potential litigation.
Congress should provide exemption from PFAS-related litigation--
including CERCLA liability--for all federally obligated airports that
maintained AARF services, as well as for airport sponsors, owners of
aircraft hangars, and landlords and lessees at public-use airports that
were required to install and maintain foam fire suppression systems by
authorities having jurisdiction.
In addition, Congress should direct FAA to provide guidance on PFAS
removal, remediation, and disposal for airports and associated aviation
businesses located on airport properties, as well as establish a short-
term grant program available to both airport sponsors and private
businesses located on airport properties to assist in PFAS removal,
remediation, and disposal.
Aviation Industry Sustainability and Innovation
Alternative Fuels
NATA is an active supporter of efforts to accelerate production and
adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as well as development of a
commercially viable, fleet authorization, unleaded alternative to
100LL. NATA commends the Congressional creation of SAF-specific tax
incentives in 2022 and believes such credits should serve as a model to
similarly incentivize production of a fleet-authorized unleaded
aviation fuel.
As a stakeholder in the Eliminate Aviation Gasoline Lead Emissions
(EAGLE) initiative, NATA is committed to laying out a clear plan to
transition piston-engine aircraft to lead-free aviation fuels by the
end of 2030--or sooner if possible--without compromising the existing
U.S. transportation infrastructure system, aviation safety, or the
economic and broader public benefits of general aviation. NATA supports
funding to accelerate required testing and regulatory approval for the
implementation of an unleaded avgas, as well as investments in
infrastructure to make alternative unleaded fuel more widely available
while we await an unleaded fuel that meets the needs of the entire
piston-aircraft fleet. The association opposes any efforts to ban 100LL
before a safe, fleet authorization alternative is widely available and
strongly supports fuel production tax incentives once that alternative
is approved.
NATA understands that we must take creative steps now to minimize
the use of leaded fuel in affected communities. To facilitate the use
of current unleaded fuels, which can service a portion of the piston-
aircraft fleet, the Association has published a white paper educating
fuel service providers on best practices for deploying multiple fuels
at airports. In addition, NATA has updated its Safety 1st General
Aviation Misfueling Prevention Program--a free, online training
resource for pilots, line service professionals, and other aircraft
refueling stakeholders--to address the risks associated with the
introduction of an additional grade of fuel.
To increase the commercial availability of current alternative
unleaded fuels, however, production must also increase. NATA strongly
believes that short-term tax credits for refiners, blenders, and
distributors of approved unleaded fuels would incentivize increased
production and accelerated deployment to airports. The introduction of
a second grade of fuel requires investments to expand existing fuel
infrastructure. In addition to AIP funding, NATA believes the
development of a short-term grant program available to both public and
private entities could be used to support unleaded fuel infrastructure
for airports and FBOs, incentivize flight school adoption of
alternative fuels, and subsidize supplemental type certificate (STCs)
or other end-user costs that could affect fuel adoption.
Lastly, Congress should also ensure a safe transition by requiring
unleaded fuel alignment with engine and airframe original equipment
manufacturers (OEMs) and American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) standards beyond any minimum standard determined by an STC. Such
requirements best assure a universally acceptable standard for
refinement and blending of products that can be consistently delivered
to airports, FBOs, and aircraft operators.
Advanced Air Mobility
Also critical to the future of general aviation is Advanced Air
Mobility (AAM), which holds enormous promise to reduce aircraft
emissions and noise impacts, to speed up cargo and medical transport in
rural areas, and to facilitate multi-modal urban mobility. However, we
must swiftly prepare for its adoption in the existing aviation
ecosystem if we hope to fully harness AAM's potential to reduce the
aviation industry's environmental impact and maintain U.S. global
aviation leadership.
NATA applauds Congressional passage of the Advanced Aviation
Infrastructure Modernization (AAIM) Act and the Advanced Air Mobility
Coordination and Leadership Act, and we thank the members of this
Subcommittee, including Subcommittee Chair Graves and Ranking Member
Larsen, for their leadership on those critical pieces of legislation in
the last Congress. Now we ask Congress to take further action to ensure
FAA development of a sound regulatory framework for AAM operations, as
well as guidance for and investment in the physical infrastructure
necessary to support them.
We see a natural nexus between existing part 135 on-demand carrier
operations, existing general aviation airports, existing FBO
infrastructure, and emerging AAM innovation. First, NATA believes both
urban and rural general aviation airports offer logical spaces to
introduce eVTOL aircraft and other AAM technologies. Second, NATA
members from all sectors are preparing to support, maintain, fuel, and
operate this next generation of aircraft, but many are seeking guidance
on the necessary infrastructure and operational guidelines to do so
safely and successfully.
In 2022, NATA formed its Advanced Air Mobility Committee to ensure
a unified approach to modernization of both our infrastructure and
operational framework. We believe communication, collaboration, and
cooperation between government partners all aviation sectors
stakeholders will be key to creating a healthy and vibrant AAM
ecosystem. To that end, NATA hosted a town hall in January to foster
connections between the AAM community, federal regulators, and leaders
from NATA's other policy committees. The discussions on operations,
ground infrastructure, safety, maintenance, security, and ground
handling training will inform NATA's legislative and regulatory
advocacy as we partner with Congress and the FAA to move this
technology forward and help stakeholders prepare for its adoption.
Aviation Funding Stability
Risks of Government Shutdown
As an operational Agency with a critical safety mission, the FAA
must be protected from risks associated with budget battles and
potential government shutdowns. The longest government shutdown in U.S.
history (2018-2019) drew national attention to the dire consequences
such shutdowns pose to the safety and security of the NAS, the
effectiveness of the FAA, and the economic growth of the aviation
industry. For 35 days, essential government employees such as air
traffic controllers and TSA agents were required to work without pay,
while nearly 18,000 FAA employees involved in a range of activities--
from certification and safety inspections to NextGen deployment--were
furloughed.
Legislation introduced in both the 116th and 117th Congresses
authorizing the FAA to draw from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund in
the event of a government shutdown enjoyed broad aviation industry
support. NATA asks this Congress to take final action on this issue in
FAA Reauthorization legislation to ensure that FAA's critical
operations continue without interruption in the event of a government
shutdown. Allowing the FAA to draw from the Airport and Airways Trust
Fund would avoid the furlough of essential workers and maintain the
Agency's vital safety and operational functions.
Fuel Fraud Diversion
To further maintain the stability of the Airport and Airway Trust
Fund, NATA urges Congress to end the diversion of non-commercial jet
fuel tax revenues. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST)
Act (PL 114-94) directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to
study the impacts of a 2005 highway bill provision that increased the
tax rate on non-commercial jet fuel to 24.4 cpg. GAO's 2016 report \4\
found that the change in tax law has the unintended effect of diverting
these non-commercial jet fuel tax revenues from the Airport and Airway
Trust Fund to the Highway Trust Fund. Specifically, the GAO report
concludes the diversion results in an annual loss to the Airport and
Airway Trust Fund of between $100 million and $200 million--one to two
billion dollars over a decade. The report also cast doubt on the
rationale behind the 2005 change in tax law and the provision's utility
going forward. NATA believes the GAO report serves as sufficient
justification for repealing the 2005 provision or requiring a transfer
of the appropriate tax funds to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund.

Aviation Industry Workforce
One of the greatest threats to our current and future general
aviation industry is the workforce shortage that continues to plague
NATA's member businesses at all organizational levels and across all
industry segments. Of ongoing concern is the gap between the supply and
demand for skilled aviation professionals such as aircraft pilots and
A&P mechanics, which Congress recognized by the creation of the section
625 workforce grants in the 2018 FAA Reauthorization. Designed to
bolster the pilot and mechanic workforce, these grants have enormous
potential to affect change but are inadequately funded to meet even a
fraction of the demand.
NATA thanks Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Ranking
Member Larsen for his introduction of the Aviation WORKS Act to
reauthorize the section 625 grants, extend them to other aviation
sectors, and increase funding levels to $20 million annually. We ask
this Subcommittee to include similar provisions in this year's
Reauthorization; we also encourage Congress to allocate sufficient
funding and resources for FAA to administer the grants more efficiently
and effectively.
Congress should also consider the expansion of existing federal
programs that can alleviate barriers to entry for aspiring pilots and
aircraft mechanics, such as eligibility for federal student loans.
Establishment of a National Center for the Advancement of Aviation will
also help recruit the next generation of aviation workforce by raising
awareness of aviation career opportunities and facilitating
collaboration between all industry sectors. Legislation to create such
a center passed the House of Representative by a wide, bipartisan
majority in 2022; we encourage its inclusion in Reauthorization
legislation.
Lastly, we ask the Subcommittee to carefully examine the
recommendations made by the Women in Aviation Advisory Board and the
Youth in Aviation Taskforce created by the 2018 FAA Reauthorization.
Collectively, these provisions will help our industry develop and
recruit the diverse, resilient workforce needed to advance the general
aviation industry.
NATA appreciates the dedication of the Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee and the Aviation Subcommittee toward an on-
time reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration, as well as
your commitment to meaningful engagement with general aviation
stakeholders throughout the process. We look forward to continued
collaboration on these and other solutions to the challenges facing our
industry and the FAA. Together, we will secure a sustainable, safe, and
successful future for our nation's general aviation industry and the
countless communities it serves.

Mr. Yakym. Thank you to our witnesses for taking time to
come here today and provide testimony.
I now yield 5 minutes to myself for questions.
I know many different people have different entry points
into the aviation world, whether it is a career or even just a
hobby. And I want to share a little bit of my own story before
I begin.
As an 8-year-old child, I was over at my Uncle Chuck's
house and looked on the floor in the corner, and I noticed an
F-16 sitting on the floor. It was a model F-16 that was a
remote-controlled airplane. And I began asking questions. And
from a little 8-year-old child, it spawned a lifelong
fascination with aviation. I went on after that to fly anything
you can fly with a remote control, everything from airplanes to
seaplanes to helicopters, drones, I mean, you name it, and I
fly it with a remote control. And as I sit here today, I am an
FAA checkride and an FAA written exam away from having my own
general aviation certificate.
But one of the things I am concerned about as I look at the
next generation is the overall pipeline for the next generation
of pilots and airplane mechanics. And I know there is a lot of
focus on older students in aviation, but I would think 8-year-
old Rudy would say that sometimes that interest is sparked at a
much younger age.
And one of the things that my interest in model aviation
taught me at a very early age is everything from physics to
aerodynamics to control surfaces and flying, and just the
overall fascination of how an airplane actually works. But the
hobby, it didn't break the bank. And it seems to me that, even
looking at the last FAA reauthorization bill, there were a lot
of new regulations that were added to the hobby, and so, we may
need to revisit that, and maybe even recalibrate that in the
upcoming reauthorization.
I am not sure--maybe even perhaps you, Mr. Pelton, can
speak to this--I know it is a little bit out of your lane. But
even more broadly, I am curious to know, what are some of the
efforts of your respective associations to reach even further
down into the education system and reach even younger students
today?
Mr. Pelton. Thank you for the question. And actually, it is
in my lane. I am glad that I turned out to be a better pilot
than my RC flying when I was a kid like you, because I crashed
an awful lot of them.
But we have a program at EAA through our chapters, which we
have collaborated with the AMA, the Academy of Model
Aeronautics. It is called our Build and Fly Program. And we
have RC models that are--we believe that part of our mission is
getting kids to work with their hands in the learning of basic
education, and they build an RC kit at the local EAA chapter,
and then they collaborate with the AMA chapter in that area to
actually go learn to fly that model, because we understand that
the 8-year-old to the 15-year-old has to have a different type
of learning experience for aviation, because you can't go out
and take a written test, you can't start your flight training,
or do any of that.
So, we are trying to fill that gap, where--Mark does such a
great job, then, of taking the formal education piece in the
post-secondary or in the high schools, and so, we collaborate,
between the two of us, on that.
We do think that the modeling rules got wrapped up in the
UAS craze of when hobby drones were so popular, and there was
such a concern for the number of those being flown improperly
and in incorrect areas that we did leave behind the fixed-wing
RC airplanes that fly at designated model fields that are
already out there and identified and confined to basically 400
feet around that airfield. And we should go back and re-address
that, because it has really put a damper on the RC flying for
young kids.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you. And now I would like to yield 5
minutes to Mr. Cohen, the Aviation Subcommittee ranking member.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Mr. Chair. That was an interesting
story about your having that experience when you were 8 years
old. I understand President Zelenskyy had one, too.
Mr. Baker, in your testimony you mentioned that the general
aviation industry is on track to exceed the safety goals
established by the General Aviation Joint Safety Committee,
which would result in another 10 percent reduction in fatal
accidents over 10 years. In your opinion, which factors and
policies contributed most to this decline, and how can we
continue to decrease general aviation accidents?
Mr. Baker. The question--I appreciate it--is about safety
and how do we keep on track with the technologies that we
continue to move through and get approved to be used in general
aviation aircraft.
For instance, ADS-B, which gives you traffic inside your
aircraft, certainly it helps in terms of awareness, whether
that comes into your cockpit today on your iPad or whatever
device you are using. So, I think a big part of reduction of
accidents is the situational awareness that you have today in
your cockpit. And that is provided by the FAA for free. So,
that has been a big, huge reduction in the accident rate.
We still have more to go. We all agree with that. But to
see that we have got flight-hours up to 26 million flight-hours
from 20 million flight-hours just 4 years ago, and have fatal
accident rates way down, we see it as a huge improvement.
Mr. Cohen. I had a constituent who was a friend and a great
member of our community in Memphis who died in a plane accident
maybe 6 months, 1 year ago. And he was in one of those planes
that had a parachute that could come out and help it come down.
He was pretty independent, ornery, and refused to do it. He
said, ``I am landing this plane.'' Well, he didn't make it.
How are those parachutes coming? They can only be on very
small planes. Are there any efforts to get them on a little bit
larger planes and to use that as a capacity?
Mr. Baker. Primarily used by the Cirrus company, the Cirrus
Aircraft company out of Duluth, Minnesota, they use it on
piston airplanes. They also have it on their small jet today.
So, they are the only company that actually builds it into the
aircraft today as part of a production model. There are some
aftermarket models available, as well. But the Cirrus group has
proven hundreds of lives have been saved by using the term
``just pull.'' And it is hard to ingrain that in a lot of
pilots, because we think we can figure it out.
Mr. Cohen. Yes.
Mr. Baker. But at the end of the day, just pull.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you, sir.
Mr. [pause] Castagna?
Mr. Castagna Castagna.
Mr. Cohen. Castagna. Thank you, I guess. In your opinion,
what investments in safety equipment, either at airports or on
aircraft, can be made by Congress to improve the safety record
of general aviation?
Mr. Castagna. Great question. I will use the State of
Alaska----
Mr. Cohen [interrupting]. Your microphone is not on, I
don't think.
Mr. Castagna. Thank you, Congressman. If I may, I will use
the State of Alaska as an example.
With more than 200 airports throughout that State, 80
percent of the communities are dependent on aviation for year-
round access. Part 135 charter industries are critical to the
life of Alaskans in that State, where we actually do medical
service, deliver food, and, in fact, even take kids to school
via aircraft. And the things that we can do in that area with
the rugged terrain and the unpredictable weather are critical
investments in weather cameras and weather stations that, while
they are in place today, they need to be upgraded, and they
need to be maintained.
Twenty years ago, we provided that system, and the agency
announced there are eight new automated weather observation
systems bringing continuous, real-time weather, which has a
direct impact to safety of the operations of those flights. And
while I use Alaska as just an example, those same automated
weather systems and camera systems could be certainly used in
the lower 48 States in more airports that would help enhance
the safety of operations of general aviation activities.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Baker, you mentioned the AOPA's high school aviation
STEM curriculum. Nearly half of your students are students of
color. What steps can the committee take to continue to advance
diversity in our aviation workforce?
And how can a proposed National Center for the Advancement
of Aviation advance this goal?
Mr. Baker. Something I am very proud of, and thank you for
that question about the STEM program that AOPA provides free to
any high school that wants it. All we are required to do is
teach the teacher how to teach the class. We made this product
free for the 9th through the 12th grade, because I wanted to
make sure we could be in any school in the country. We do home
schools in Alaska. We do inner city schools all over the
country. About half the students are people of color that are
taking this, and over 25 percent are young women are taking
this class.
And it is a very hard and difficult class. In STEM
education, you have to pay attention. And to have over 50,000
young people that have touched this class already, the
opportunity of putting the NCAA together is to broaden the
reach of every State. There are 43 today, but we have States
like Oklahoma that have 70 high schools that are teaching this
today. We have 16,000 students right now, sitting in classrooms
around the country, learning about aviation education and then
career opportunities that have never been better.
Mr. Cohen. Do you, by chance, know if they have that in
Memphis?
Mr. Baker. Sorry?
Mr. Cohen. Do they have that program in Memphis schools?
Mr. Baker. Yes, they do.
Mr. Cohen. Excellent. FedEx can use those pilots.
Thank you, sir. I yield back.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Cohen. I now yield 5 minutes to
my colleague, Mr. Collins.
Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Baker, what can we do to--and I am asking the question
because I heard it twice in a row there, and I am a student
pilot, so, I am not to my checkride yet. DPEs, what do we do to
get more people into that?
Mr. Baker. Into aviation?
Mr. Collins. Yes, sir.
Mr. Baker. So, I think this high school program is a way--
and Mr. Pelton and the team at EAA, in terms of giving rides,
and bringing people to the airport, and having great events at
the airport, and exposing young people to the idea that they
have careers, whether they be military, airline, or flying for
general aviation. The opportunities have never been better, and
so, that is why I am excited about what our high school program
does. And working together with some of these EAA chapters
around the country, getting kids out to the airport and seeing
that they can be part of this great community, that is part of
the exposure.
I think we have more opportunity. We are doing really well.
This year, you are going to see a record number of pilot's
licenses being granted.
Mr. Collins. OK. Did you want to add something to that, Mr.
Pelton?
Mr. Pelton. You brought up DPE also?
Mr. Collins. No, sir.
Mr. Pelton. OK. Well, I--Mark covered it very well.
Mr. Collins. OK. All right. Mr. Baker, I want to venture
over to some cybersecurity. NOTAM. It seems like the FAA had
more focus on changing the name of that acronym, writing a 176-
page rule, spending thousands and thousands of dollars to do
that. Notice to Airmen was changed to Notice to Air Missions. I
asked if it was a safety change, which--no answer was given.
That is a 30-year-old software program. They could have spent
time improving that, which they didn't. They spent time
changing the name, because their focus was more on being woke
than they are on safety.
On Tuesday, the TSA released emergency updates for aviation
cybersecurity requirements for aircraft operators and airports.
Do you think the FAA is being proactive to invest, direct, and
implement cybersecurity requirements for aircraft?
Is the FAA doing enough to keep the pilots, crew, and
passengers safe from potential cyber attack?
Mr. Baker. So, from the perspective of the cyber attack, I
was surprised, I think, as everybody else in aviation, that
there was a single point of failure around the NOTAM system,
which has been around for a long period of time. Very
frustrating.
We know some of the systems that we use for aircraft
registration and medical certificates are months and months and
months behind. So, the FAA needs to focus on all of these
systems that they are employing today to make sure that they
are up to date.
Mr. Collins. I would open it up to anybody else.
Mr. Pelton. I think the concern we all should have is
anybody that is running a business today knows what the threats
are and what we are spending on an ongoing basis to prevent
cyber attacks. And I think we ought to probably have the FAA go
benchmark what are these large companies that have been held
hostage by ransomware and other cyber attacks like that, to see
what kind of plans they put in place. Because it is not only
the protection, but it is also the ability to recover and stand
your systems back up.
Mr. Collins. On February 7th, Representative Rouzer asked
Acting Administrator Boulter that same question, basically. And
it was a pretty insufficient response.
So, I think I will just ask it again to everybody: Do you
think the FAA has an actual plan to cyber secure the aircraft
that we all depend on to get to our jobs and see our loved
ones? Or is the FAA falling behind on their responsibilities to
keep Americans safe?
Mr. Pelton. I certainly don't have any insight as to what
they are doing.
Mr. Collins. OK.
Mr. Pelton. That wouldn't be in my swim lane.
Mr. Castagna. Congressman, I would say that the technology
advancement in aircraft today that require Wi-Fi and other
connectivity in the technology at our aviation businesses,
there is a huge demand for creating more bandwidth. And with
that bandwidth comes more risk for cybersecurity and attacks,
where a lot of these software programs in the aircraft are
dependent on that access at airports to upgrade their software
systems. And so, I am not sure there is a plan that is in place
today to accommodate that, but there is certainly a need for
it.
Mr. Crider. I would echo that, too, that there is a focus
on cybersecurity from the airport operators, because there is
so much connection between airline information, user
information, FAA information that all comes together, that
platform. So, very much a focus of the airport industry and
close collaboration with the FAA and CERCLA, as well.
Mr. Collins. Thank you. From what I have been hearing,
people I have been talking to, it seems like there is a big
disconnect between the mid-level management and the executive
branch of the FAA.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Collins.
I now recognize Mr. Larsen, ranking member of the full
committee, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
First off, I want to make a note that I am very happy that
FAA has changed the name of NOTAMs to Notice to Air Missions.
It is inclusive, and we need to send a message to everybody to
attract as many people into aviation as possible. And the
problem with NOTAMs isn't the name change, the problem with
NOTAMs is a lack of technology investment, which we have an
opportunity to work together on to resolve. And we can stay
focused on working together to resolve this problem as part of
the FAA reauthorization. I am looking forward to doing that in
a bipartisan manner.
Mr. Castagna, with the first unleaded fuel finally
certified last year, the FAA's new goal for completely
transitioning the GA fleet is 2030. Is that timeline still
realistic?
Mr. Castagna. The process for the transition to unleaded
fuel, as we know, is a complex process. We believe that there
is a pathway forward to do that, and potentially the means to
do that in advance of 2030.
I would say that there is a commercially viable unleaded
fuel product that is out in the market today. While we know
that it only serves 70 percent of the fleet, we know that those
airports that are critically sensitive to environmental
impacts--and if they do an inventory of their own piston fleet,
in some cases, airports--their base piston aircraft could
exceed that 70 percent.
So, our position is really to encourage airports to work
together with FBOs and the user community to find ways to bring
the commercially available product to the marketplace today,
especially in those environmentally sensitive communities that
are impacted, in advance of 2030, and ask Congress to put the
resources necessary into--whether it is tax credits or
incentives--for the refinement and blending of that fuel to get
it out into the marketplace sooner.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, thanks.
Mr. Baker, can you answer that same question?
Mr. Baker. So, yes. I believe that we have one fuel that
has an STC today that was approved in September of last year. I
believe there is an attempt to start rolling that out, airport
by airport, in a controlled environment, hopefully in the next
several months. I believe that that is our first opportunity.
There is another STC applicant right behind that, and the
pathing process is still in process.
But I have more confidence today than I did a year ago,
when we started the EAGLE, that we have got the whole industry
working together to solve this problem as quickly as possible,
but as safely as possible, because we cannot just transfer this
to 94 octane and hope that the other airplanes find that fuel
somewhere else. We have to keep low lead available while we
have this process going on.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, and I appreciate that. The
transition has to still result in aviation safety. That has to
be the priority of the committee as we move forward. But if
there are ways--because frustrated communities, angry
communities because of leaded fuel--finding a way to move that
timeline safely is going to be important. And I hope we put
some focus on that, and not resist that as we move forward on
FAA reauthorization.
I was going to ask--oh, yes. Mr. Crider, on the funding
side of things through the BIL, are you satisfied--or maybe
that is the wrong question, since you represent a lot of
airports. If you had to pick your friends, which one would you
have--no.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Larsen of Washington. The distribution of the dollars
from the BIL for airports, from either a percentage or from an
absolute numbers perspective, is GA getting its fair share--
airports, smaller airports, nonprimary airports--getting this
fair share? How would you assess that?
Mr. Crider. Well, I can speak to my own example at Kelly
Field. That was a huge shot in the arm. We are putting that
money to work for design of a consolidated facility which
supports fixed-based operations, Federal inspection station,
advanced air mobility, all those good things.
But I think, at the end of the day, we are looking at the
formula, how GA airports are funded. The entitlement portion is
really critical. And that is part of the testimony that many of
us have touched on.
I represent a large industrial commercial--a lot of
commercial activity. So, we have everything from the very
largest design Group VI aircrafts, like 747-8s, all the way
down to a Cessna 172. So, that $150,000 is really a drop in the
bucket, frankly, on projects that respond to that scale. So, I
think it is a mixed bag.
But certainly BIL was a great shot in the arm, and
hopefully this reauthorization can have more good to come.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, thanks.
Mr. Pelton, on the safety issue, the safety within GA and
Arlington Municipal, where I grew up, a small town, has a
pretty active experimental aviation crowd. They are doing good
things. We also in the past have had some serious accidents, as
well. Can you chat a little bit, maybe specific to your part of
the industry, on safety and what you do to try to decrease
incidents and accidents?
Mr. Pelton. Yes, absolutely. Thank you for the question.
The experimental amateur-built started out back in the
1950s, with a pretty poor safety record. One was because they
weren't necessarily well engineered and designed products. They
were people on their own in their garage coming up with designs
to go fly.
As this industry has evolved, it really is now down to
major aircraft kit manufacturers who have extremely well
designed, tested, and proven products that are holding up well
with the safety record.
They are also including now, because of the ability to not
have to put certified products in the airplane, it has the
latest up-to-date safety enhancements in the cockpits that we
are seeing. So, that is improving also. And last year, we made
a significant change to the flight testing program for anybody
that does build a new airplane that really helps add a second
pilot in the airplane that has experience in that make and
model to ensure it is tested appropriately and properly.
So, we are seeing very good progress. We track it monthly.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. That is great.
Mr. Chair, I want to apologize for 2 days in a row going a
full 54 seconds over my time, and I will do better in the
future with that. I will not yield back, since I have no time
to yield back. Thank you.
Mr. Yakym. The Chair will reserve his comments. I now yield
5 minutes to my friend, Mr. Stauber.
Mr. Stauber. Mr. Chair, thank you very much, and thanks to
the witnesses.
We talked about the NOTAM bill that passed out of the House
with 424 votes, bipartisan. I would encourage us all to talk to
our Senators to get it across the finish line, because we can
get that task force up and running very, very quickly, which
will increase safety in the skies.
I am very excited that we will have a general aviation
title in this reauthorization bill. General aviation is the
backbone of our aviation system. As someone who started working
on their private pilot license later in life, I want to
encourage more and more individuals to get involved with
aviation at a younger age, and I want to make it more
accessible. That is why I would like to focus my time on the
National Center for the Advancement of Aviation, or, as it is
commonly referred to, the NCAA bill.
As you know, the NCAA bill was introduced in the last
Congress by Mr. Carson and my former colleague, the late Don
Young from Alaska. While nobody can fill Congressman Young's
shoes, I am announcing today that I will be joining Mr. Carson
to reintroduce the bipartisan, bicameral NCAA bill. I firmly
believe this center will help coordinate industry and
Government aviation workforce efforts, inspire and train the
next generation of aviators, and boost innovation in American
flight.
Mr. Baker, thank you for being here. It is always good to
have a fellow Minnesotan on the panel. I know AOPA has long
been a champion of the NCAA. It also has been intimately
involved in workforce programs such as your high school STEM
program, which is quite impressive. Could you please speak to
your AOPA STEM program a bit more, and share how the NCAA will
help expand the STEM program and grow it?
Mr. Baker. Thank you for the question, fellow Minnesotan.
The STEM program was started about 6 years ago, and we
built the ninth grade curriculum, which is about introduction
of all things aviation. By the 10th grade program, they start
to learn about airfoils, building wind tunnels out of a box,
covered box, with a fan. These are very low-cost ways to get
young people to understand lift and drag and all those things
that go into the components, and hopefully inspire people to be
an engineer, as well as a controller, as well as a pilot, or
whatever, mechanic, that comes out of the opportunities. And we
show them the lifetime earnings by the time they are in the
11th grade, about the money you can make today in an aviation
career everywhere.
And what I am really proud to say is we now know, because
we have been doing this for 5 years, the graduating class, 70
percent of these young people are going into some form of
aviation career pattern. One-third of them are actually looking
at the military as one of the possibilities, as well. We work
with the Air Force and their recruiting staff to make sure that
we are tying these young people--there are over 80 colleges
today around the country that will give you college credits for
taking these classes in high school.
Mr. Stauber. Yes.
Mr. Baker. So, it really saves this young person a lot of
money for their freshman year, or their junior year college
credit.
So, we are really proud of the program. Today, with 400
high schools, I think the opportunity is to get to 2,500 high
schools, about 10 percent of all the high schools in this
country, working with the NCAA, which is coordinating all the
other things that go on in this aviation industry, because we
all care about the same outcome: workforce.
Mr. Stauber. The return on the investment, 70 percent go
into the aviation sector. That is tremendous. That is what is
called great success.
In closing I will say that the National Center for the
Advancement of Aviation overwhelmingly passed the House last
year. It has the support of the entire aviation industry, from
general aviation, airlines, airports, unions, manufacturers,
and many others.
Again, I appreciate working on this issue to honor the late
Congressman Don Young. I know myself and Mr. Carson will work
with our colleagues to see this included in the FAA
reauthorization.
And, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Stauber. The Chair now recognizes
Ms. Brownley for 5 minutes.
Ms. Brownley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Crider, first, thank you for mentioning the CONTRACT
Act in your testimony. I appreciate it very much. I am very
glad that we got it in the omnibus package at the end of last
year.
You mentioned in your testimony that controller staffing
still continues to be a challenge. So, can you talk a little
bit about what else you think Congress can do to help ensure
that we have enough controllers at contract tower airports?
Mr. Crider. Certainly. Well, first of all, Representative
Brownley, thank you for your leadership on that appropriations
language. That was important. The CONTRACT Act was very
impactful.
But I think, to answer your question, looking at the wage
scales, we have seen a period of inflation. And so, the
Contract Tower Program has fell prey to that. So, Department of
Labor focus on the wage scales that contract tower contractors
are able to pay, I think, is important.
And I think better coordination between the FAA Tower
Programs and the Contract Tower Programs--we understand that
there is a migration of folks, especially young people, that
start at the contract tower and then move up to the FAA. A
better coordination about how that workforce happens, so that
we don't unintentionally impact contract hours at smaller
airports, GA airports, small commercial service airports. I
think those are two important improvements that could be
addressed.
Ms. Brownley. So, what would that look like in terms of FAA
and contract and that transition?
Mr. Crider. The transition? Well, one of the things we hear
from the contractors is a little more flexibility in how they
do the training. So, speed to market, if you will, the ability
to do some on-the-job training and training more regionally, as
opposed to being constricted by the flow of students that can
go through Oklahoma City or other traditional.
So, part of it is just a more aggressive and more
innovative approaches to training, I think, will help that
workforce pipeline.
Ms. Brownley. Thank you for that. And from your
perspective, what do airports need from Congress to be able to
expand the availability of sustainable aviation fuels?
Mr. Crider. Well, I think airports stand ready to be part
of that conversation. We are excited to be part of EAGLE. It is
a great collaboration of associations from OEMs, from the fuel
manufacturers. So, being a part of that, I think, is important.
It was mentioned before that we don't want to throw the
baby out with the bath water. Airports stand ready to make sure
the infrastructure is in place for this transition. But we
don't want to be premature about making the change. In other
words, be a part of the conversation, help with the solutions,
but also be mindful that we don't want to impede the important
activities that happen at GA airports, many of those with
avgas-burning aircraft.
Ms. Brownley. Great. Mr. Baker, do you have anything to add
with regards to that?
Mr. Baker. I think, if I understand the question correctly,
how does Congress help us grow aviation with these general
aviation airports. As I mentioned a bit ago, a real hot button
for our users of these airports today is the requirement that
all federally obligated airports provide a transient ramp space
for aircraft so that they can park their airplanes there,
regardless of make or model, whether they need or don't need an
FBO service, a place to park at these airports.
And as well, I mentioned hangars. We are woefully short on
hangars on these federally supported airports. They need to
have those spaces there.
I think there is opportunity to get badging requirements,
so that we can work together with the FBO so that, instead of
having a different badge for each airport, we could work with
the TSA so we can expedite in and out of the airports with
security needs that they may have at those airports.
Those are some of the things that Congress could really
help us with.
Ms. Brownley. Thank you.
Mr. Castagna, do you have anything else to add on
sustainable aviation fuel?
Mr. Castagna. Thank you, Congresswoman, for passing the
blender's tax credit. I think that supply cannot meet demand
today with SAF, so, we must continue to incentivize the
commercializing of that product.
We also must continue funding FAA's ASCENT program and the
Department of Energy's BETO office to continue their excellent
work on SAF feedstocks and technology. And SAF represents the
best way for today's aircraft to really reduce the
environmental carbon footprint. And so, the investments in
these areas, we think, are critical.
Ms. Brownley. What about incentives for production of SAF?
Mr. Castagna. So, those same tax incentives and credits
would be for production and refinement and blending and,
ultimately, delivery to the airports.
Ms. Brownley. Very good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield
back.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Ms. Brownley. The Chair now
recognizes Mr. Perry for 5 minutes.
Mr. Perry. I thank the chair.
Mr. Baker, your testimony raises AOPA's concerns about
Santa Clara County's decision to ban 100 Low Lead aviation
fuel. And I think I am going to quote you here by saying, `` .
. . required by thousands of general aviation aircraft to fly
safely . . . '' and that the decision to ban it is `` . . .
simply irresponsible.''
Now, look, if you want to have a private airport and ban
airplanes, that is your business. God bless you. But if we are
going to be federally funding your airport, then we ought to
have something to say about it. And I find it particularly
offensive--not only unsafe and irresponsible, but offensive--
that for some insane Green New Deal ideology, you are going to
ban anything. If you are going to have a partially federally
funded airport, you are going to provide the fuel necessary.
And I don't know if anybody is familiar with catastrophic
engine failure in flight, but I can guarantee you, it is an
unpleasant experience.
Mr. Baker, can you explain the impact on those maybe flying
law enforcement missions, disaster relief, search and rescue,
understanding that we all would like to fly something that uses
Jet A, that is awesome, but we all can't afford Jet A. Can you
explain the impact?
Mr. Baker. Yes, it is a huge impact. Thank you for the
question. We believe, working with the FAA and trying to
enforce the idea that a federally obligated airport, you are
required to carry the fuel that allows for the safe
transportation of all aircraft, not just some of the aircraft.
And we have already had one accident in Santa Clara today. We
have had other misfuellings that have had to refuel or defuel
the airplane.
This ecosystem that goes together with these 5,000 public-
use airports is so important that they all provide the same
level of safety and fuel for these aircraft. We all believe we
can get to this transition by 2030, but we need to make sure
that we don't have gaps in that system in the meantime. So,
that is one of the things we are pushing really hard, to make
sure that we have a supply of low-lead fuel until there is an
alternative fuel in place that can support all aircraft, not
just some.
Mr. Perry. And the alternative needs to be affordable,
right, not just some alternative that meets the specific
requirement but that nobody can afford to use, again, to go
after the insane Green New Deal ideology.
Could you provide the subcommittee with some details
surrounding the accident in question regarding Santa Clara's
ban of 100 Low Lead, and the misfuelling that took place?
Mr. Baker. As I understand it, a high-horsepower,
approximately 300-horsepower engine, got to the airport, needed
fuel to get on to the next airport, put on some fuel. And I
don't know exactly what happened to the detonation of that
engine, but the engine came apart shortly after takeoff.
Mr. Perry. And what resulted at that point?
Mr. Baker. Fortunately, there were no fatalities. But
certainly any time you have an aircraft coming out of the space
in an urban area, there is high risk.
Mr. Perry. Yes, high risk. And I will tell you the pucker
factor, if you are sitting in the seat or anywhere in the
aircraft--and that is what we call it when we are in the seat,
the pucker factor--like, you can't pull a fishing line out of
your rear end with a tractor, all right? And that is not a
position to put pilots in for, again, insane Green New Deal,
woke ideology.
In the past few committee hearings, I have raised the issue
and, unfortunately, these concerns that I have had have become
reality.
The upcoming FAA reauthorization bill is something that we
are looking forward to. And in your opinion--I know mine, but I
want to hear yours, because you are representing folks that
don't get to sit in these seats--what should Congress do to
ensure these things don't happen?
Mr. Baker. I think there are two things that Congress can
do. One is to make sure that we don't lose availability of 100
Low Lead until there is a suitable, affordable replacement.
The second thing we could do is to try and work with some
of these STC holders to try to go faster and get the fuel in
these markets faster, so, we get some learnings done and some
demonstrations done. I think there should be some money
allocated to these STC holders to try and get that fuel in the
market faster.
But in the meantime, we cannot allow slippage in any part
of this ecosystem that doesn't keep 100 Low Lead available.
Mr. Perry. So, should there be a penalty of sorts for
airports federally funded that decide to ban it?
Mr. Baker. That is correct.
Mr. Perry. You would agree there should be?
Mr. Baker. I agree.
Mr. Perry. All right.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield the balance.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Perry. The Chair now recognizes
Mr. Stanton for 5 minutes.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding
this hearing today. Thank you to each of our witnesses for
being here today.
General aviation is a key part of Arizona's aviation
economy, supporting nearly 19,000 jobs and contributing $3.3
billion in economic activity just in 2019. And in Arizona, we
have 3 of the top 10 busiest general aviation airports in the
country. So, ensuring continued support for and growth of
general aviation must be a top priority for FAA
reauthorization.
Today, I want to focus on the Contract Tower Program, which
is one of the FAA's most successful Government-industry
partnerships and serves the general aviation community. In
Arizona, we have seven contract towers, including Phoenix-Mesa
Gateway, the busiest contract tower in the country, in terms of
traffic.
This important air traffic safety program maintains and
develops general aviation activity and supports DoD flight
training operations and military readiness, as well as the
pilot flight schools all across the country. And it is also
important to note that contract towers account for
approximately one-third of all tower operations in the Nation,
and about 70 percent of contract controllers are veterans.
Mr. Crider, what benefits does the Contract Tower Program
provide to the National Airspace System, especially for the
general aviation community?
Mr. Crider. Well, I think it is a tremendous success story.
It has been proven many times that the safety record is on par
with the FAA towers. It really serves as an entry point for
airports that have reached that point of operations where they
need a tower. So, it is a great entry point for ATC activities.
We talked before about some of the workforce issues, but I
think a renewed focus on reconstruction, rebuilding,
refurbishing the towers that are in place, the workforce
itself, as we talked about, but also the real-time equipment
that the controllers need to integrate into our National
Airspace System, make sure they have the situational awareness
and the equipment that facilitates that safe transition.
Mr. Stanton. And you mentioned workforce. I know my
colleague, Congresswoman Brownley, had a question about
workforce earlier. Staffing shortages continue to be a major
challenge throughout the industry, including the Phoenix-Mesa
Gateway Airport.
We recently opened a brandnew $30 million air traffic
control tower at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway, but staffing shortages
have reduced operations at the tower by 4 hours each day
because contract employees have, unfortunately, left, often
with only a few weeks' notice, to go work for the FAA instead.
These positions cannot easily be filled, as it often takes 6
months to train a new controller. And that leaves airports like
Phoenix-Mesa Gateway with difficult operational decisions in
order to adjust. I want to ask a question about it, because you
already talked about workforce issues.
But Mr. Crider, on a different note, your written testimony
highlights the important role that the general aviation sector
will play in the deployment of advanced air mobility. Can you
elaborate on general aviation airports' potential
infrastructure needs to help accommodate this new technology?
Mr. Crider. Absolutely. I think that what we are seeing,
whether it is the eVTOLs, or some of the other emerging
technologies, that R&D is done at GA airports. Typically, it is
for reasons of operations, or available land, or for whatever
reason. So, I think GA airports will continue to play a really
important role in where those vehicles are built, where they
are tested and proven. And ultimately, I think they provide a
new dimension for underserved markets, for regional air
mobility, for last mile, if you will, or connectivity to the
hub and spoke system.
So, I think this entire discussion of advanced air mobility
is truly ripe for the GA airport community and communities that
are served by GA airports.
Mr. Stanton. My last question is for Mr. Castagna: What key
elements should the FAA consider as it develops the necessary
certification and operating standards for AAM?
Mr. Castagna. Thank you, Congressman. Great question. I
think that there is an extreme nexus between the current part
135 operators that exist today, and those regulatory processes,
and the AAM community, where it is a natural segue, where we
believe that that industry is going to rely on that same type
of regulatory platform.
Our organization is prepared to--and we have already
established a committee to meet with the AAM and the vertiport
community to see how we can integrate those activities into our
regulatory process to advocate for those. And to tap into what
Mr. Crider said, the infrastructure required at airports, it
requires the streamlining of building codes and other types of
coordination, where we will be able to provide the necessary
power grid to support those activities.
Mr. Stanton. I appreciate your answers.
I yield back.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Stanton. The Chair now recognizes
Mr. Burchett for 5 minutes.
Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You all probably got
up this morning and thought, ``Wow, I am going to go to
Congress. It is going to be really exciting.'' And then they
brought you in here, and they didn't offer you any snacks. So,
I will try to make this as painful as possible for each and
every one of you.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Burchett. Mr. Crider, the FAA required airports to use
a toxic firefighting foam. And now, of course, it is warning
the airports that it may be held liable for doing so. Is that
correct?
Mr. Crider. That is correct. I think that that is a big
focus of airports, to make sure that there are protections in
place.
Mr. Burchett. What do these airports need to do to
transition to a new firefighting material?
Mr. Crider. Well, first of all, we need to patiently wait
for the new materials.
Mr. Burchett. Say that again. I am sorry.
Mr. Crider. Well, I think, first of all, we are all
patiently waiting for the new materials to be approved. So,
having a viable alternative to PFAS materials is the first in
line.
But generally, airports preparing to make the transition as
far as vehicles and equipment, those are all big factors. So,
again, it is another topic. You don't want to throw the baby
out with the bath water. It is a regulated material. It is used
to enhance safety. So, none of us want to jeopardize safety or
an important tool to save lives until there is a valid
alternative in place.
Mr. Burchett. But you are confident something is in the
pipeline, so to speak?
Mr. Crider. Sir?
Mr. Burchett. You are confident that this new material is
in the pipeline, so to speak?
Mr. Crider. Yes.
Mr. Burchett. Any idea when they will wave the magic wand
and say it is OK?
Mr. Crider. No magic wand, sir. I can get you an IOU on
that, certainly, but I don't have that in front of me.
Mr. Burchett. Right. Probably about the time the of the new
one, they'll need another one.
Mr. Castagna, how do you say that name? Help me out there,
brother.
Mr. Castagna. Castagna, like lasagna.
Mr. Burchett. Castagna, I got it.
Mr. Castagna. Castagna, there you go.
Mr. Burchett. I got you. Well, Burchett. Nobody gets it
right, either, so, don't worry about it.
Do you think the FAA issues timely rulemakings? Of course,
this is a leading question, so, go ahead.
Mr. Castagna. So, the rulemaking process is certainly
troubling for our members and needs refinement.
Mr. Burchett. What kind of timeline do you usually put on
something like that, I mean, when you are sitting around at the
coffee table at work?
Mr. Castagna. Well, when we are looking at rulemaking
today, you are looking at at least a year-long process or more.
Mr. Burchett. Well, if it is any consolation, it takes me
over 6 months to get a response from the IRS. That's not for
me, personally, it is for my constituents.
Do you feel like this affects America's influence on
international aviation standards?
Mr. Castagna. The rulemaking? I absolutely do, from the
standpoint of our collective industry here has been the world's
leading power in aviation. And the fact that we are slowing
down the process, we are competing now with other foreign
governments that are moving technology and moving activities at
a much faster pace than we are.
Mr. Burchett. Mr. Pelton or Mr. Baker, do you have anything
to add to any of this?
Mr. Pelton. As far as rulemaking is concerned, it is
absurdly long. I mean, I don't think--when you talk about 12
months, it is usually 24 months. We have been working this
MOSAIC issue, which is very important to the growth of general
aviation, and I think everybody is in agreement as to what
needs to be done. And it will be 2024 before we see it. Because
of that, we will not be able to certify electric-powered
airplanes, which, right now, this is some of the environmental
issues that we are dealing with, along with new technologies
that are being held behind.
What is probably the most offensive, as a U.S. citizen, is
Brazil has already put this in place, and they did it in less
than 1 year.
Mr. Burchett. Brazil has?
Mr. Pelton. They put the equivalent of MOSAIC improvements
to LSA, the LSA category of airplanes.
Mr. Burchett. You mentioned the electric airplanes. I know
that I saw something on hydrogen airplanes, hydrogen-powered,
new green hydrogen or whatever that is. I mean, it is just a
byproduct of water. But go ahead. I am wondering where is that
in your all's figuring?
Mr. Pelton. Hydrogen has been around in development, and
everybody jumped all the way to electric power, which I think
we have all found that the battery density power is not where
it needs to be, from a----
Mr. Burchett. Yes, I suspect the big boys at the table,
corporate table, probably figured that out pretty quick, that
somebody could fill up in Knoxville down there at Fort Loudoun
Lake, and cut them out of their deal. So--but I am not a
conspiracy theorist.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Burchett. And I am not bitter, either.
Mr. Pelton. I think that when you get back to the
rulemaking piece, this is another example of there are many
technologies out there that we need to explore, and let those
who are ready to be able to be implemented, allow them to move
forward without jumping to the far end of the technology curve.
Mr. Burchett. Thank you. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Baker, I have no time left, so, if you can say
something quickly so you can earn your keep today.
You are good? All right. That is great.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the remainder of my time. Thank
you very much.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Burchett. The Chair now
recognizes Mr. Auchincloss for 5 minutes.
Mr. Auchincloss. Thank you, Chair.
And Mr. Baker, I will let you get a turn here. You
mentioned in your testimony that modernizing the air traffic
control system is among the primary safety and regulatory
functions of the FAA. How can Congress use this FAA reauth bill
to help modernize outdated air traffic control systems, and
improve the workforce pipeline?
Mr. Baker. So, the workforce pipeline--I think the support
of the NCAA bill, which has been mentioned, is the number-one
way that we can move that forward. And as was mentioned before,
400 Members of Congress approved it the last time around. It is
important to get that done and pull the whole aviation
community together to work on workforce, because there is a lot
of young people that want to be in aviation.
As far as other things that the Congress can do, from a
safety perspective and growing aviation, we think it is really
important that we take these technologies, as Jack just
mentioned, some of these things, these technologies, need to
get approved faster and faster, and we are way too slow today
in the rulemaking process.
Mr. Auchincloss. Thank you.
Mr. Crider, I am interested in ways that airports can more
effectively manage curbside traffic to improve the passenger
experience, and improve throughput from curb all the way to the
gate. One way smart cities are tackling this issue is through
remote enforcement of curb management policies: drop off,
parking, et cetera. This allows cities to better manage the
curb and in a more cost effective way.
How could large and medium-sized airports benefit from
remote curbside enforcement?
Mr. Crider. Well, I think there is a myriad of technologies
that are being deployed at airports, whether it is for TNCs,
which speaks directly to curbside management.
Mr. Auchincloss. TMCs?
Mr. Crider. Transportation Network Carriers.
Mr. Auchincloss. Oh, TNCs, got it.
Mr. Crider. TNCs--I am sorry, the Ubers and Lyfts of the
world, to wait time analysis, that give the passenger better
information and a better experience.
So, I think the short answer is more technology and more
integration of technology into the terminal.
Mr. Auchincloss. At the Federal level, are there
proscriptions or laws that are impairing the ability of
airports to do remote enforcement of curbside management?
So, obviously, you are allowed to get traffic----
Mr. Crider [interrupting]. Nothing I am aware of, but we
can certainly get an answer back to you. I will be----
Mr. Auchincloss [interrupting]. I would appreciate that. If
you could follow up with my office on impediments you see to
the ability to use technology to do remote enforcement, I would
appreciate that.
Mr. Crider. OK. So, specifically to remote enforcement?
Mr. Auchincloss. We would love your input on the entire
curb management situation, but particularly on whether airports
are interested in trying to do remote enforcement and are held
back by existing Federal law or regulation from FAA.
Mr. Crider. OK.
Mr. Auchincloss. And then, again for you, Mr. Crider, you
mentioned in your testimony that capital needs for nonprimary
and GA airports are more than $19 billion over the next 5
years. And I agree that supplementary discretionary grants and
increased AIP funding could help support commercial and GA
airports' ongoing infrastructure needs, coupled with additional
flexibility in how airports can spend AIP funds.
Could you walk us through why airports need that additional
flexibility, especially larger airports like Logan at Boston?
Mr. Crider. Well, I think there are some trends--regulatory
process, environmental clearances, part 163 requirements--that
slow down development, and candidly, add cost to the
development. So, I think those are some areas that--a better
collaboration between the airports community, the FAA, and
Congress to find the right mix.
Certainly, we don't want to go backwards in the
advancements of the reasons for those laws. I think a
streamlining of the regulatory process and approval process is
really what we are asking for.
Mr. Auchincloss. Terrific. I am going to yield back,
actually, the rest of my time.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Auchincloss. The Chair now
recognizes Mr. Molinaro for 5 minutes.
Mr. Molinaro. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that.
I spent the last 12 years overseeing one of the largest
general aviation airports in New York State: Poughkeepsie, New
York. Recognizing the valuable role general aviation plays in
the aviation community, I can tell you in my district alone, it
is responsible for hundreds of jobs and $60 million worth of
economic activity. It is very much the backbone of America's
aviation world and, in many ways, the pipeline to jobs. And so,
I would like to continue down the workforce development path
for a moment.
Mr. Pelton, we recognize that there is increased obvious
demand for pilots and moving them through that pipeline. U.S.
flight schools are oversubscribed, both large and small, we
know. We are not able to meet the demand. And in many cases, of
course, this is slowing down the ability to move pilots from
general aviation to other occupations in the commercial sector.
Could you just talk briefly about what happens to America's
aviation system, if you will, if these flight schools don't
exist?
And quite frankly, also what we might do to expand
capacity.
Mr. Pelton. Well, thank you for the question. I think, when
you forecast forward what we are seeing as far as the needs and
demands from pilots, whether it be the military or commercial
aviation over the next 10 years, the facts pretty much stand
for themselves as to, if we are not able to keep that pipeline
going, then our commercial travel will be slowed down because
of the shortage of pilots to be able to operate in the
commercial sector.
So, that is really where we will see it, long term. And
that is an effort that is compounded by the retirement of
airline pilots in the baby boomer era, and then the lack of new
pilots coming forward. So, it is critically important that we
have a viable training sector, that we support it.
Again, some of our earlier discussion around the ability to
have Designated Pilot Examiners, which are a shortage right
now, is one of the leading factors to it.
And we also believe that MOSAIC, which is the regulatory
change, rulemaking change, that we are hoping will be able to
bring new aircraft into the market that are more affordable and
more efficient for the flight training market.
Also hoping to be able to reduce the costs associated with
training with those new developments.
Mr. Molinaro. I appreciate that. So, we developed, in
conjunction with our community college--and I certainly would
like to see more of this across the country--an experiential
hangar for pilot training and airframe mechanics.
Mr. Baker, could you just--following up on your testimony
regarding AOPA, the aviation STEM curriculum, speak
specifically to the value of the section 625 workforce
development grants, how they help to prepare the next
generation of aviation workforce.
Mr. Baker. So, yes, our STEM program, which was funded
exclusively by donors to the AOPA Foundation, was built over 4
or 5 years to create STEM education from the 9th to the 12th
grade. And again, it is free to all the schools that want to do
it. Today, we are in 400 schools. I think the opportunity to be
in 2,500 high schools around this country with about 1 out of
every 10 is the opportunity if we get the NCAA moving along the
right way.
I think we can get a lot of energy around this, because
these opportunities can be used in high school to get college
credits, whatever career it is, whether it is mechanic,
technician, controller, pilot, engineer, all these career
opportunities have never been better, and these young people
are excited about it.
And today, we have got over 40 percent of these young
people are people of color. We have got over 25 percent young
women taking these tough classes in high school.
Mr. Molinaro. Yes, it is truly tremendous. And the truth of
the matter is, I think America does itself a disservice by not
putting value on this education in K-12, and certainly then
connecting to higher education in those flight schools to build
out not only the workforce, but to create that connection to
jobs that, quite frankly, pay exceptionally well.
With the last name Molinaro, I only feel badly, Mr.
Castagna, that I had nothing to ask you. But if you wanted to
add, I feel like Mr. Baker was given an extra 8 seconds a few
moments ago, feel free to jump in.
Mr. Castagna. If I may.
Mr. Molinaro. And then I yield, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Castagna. As an adjunct professor for over 30 years,
and having taught at the collegiate level for aviation and
airport management, I would encourage us, as we look for
opportunities to increase the workforce development, that we go
beyond the traditional air traffic controller, pilot, flight
attendant, mechanic, and look for the thousands of technical
jobs that are available to our workforce in the airport and
aviation community, and that we expand those grant
opportunities beyond the traditional roles, and we look for
more widespread use of technical jobs that might not require 4-
year educations.
Mr. Molinaro. Thank you.
And thanks, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Molinaro. The Chair now
recognizes Ms. Titus for 5 minutes.
Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Well, I represent Las Vegas, so, you know how important
general aviation is to my district. Without it, we wouldn't
have corporate planes bringing people to our conventions or
individuals coming out for big events. Now we are going to have
the Grand Prix right down the Strip in the middle of my
district, and the Super Bowl, also in my district. So, I am
going to see a lot of you all's planes coming in and out, I
feel like. So, this is important, and I appreciate all the
testimony.
Last session of Congress, I worked with Mr. Larsen and Mr.
Graves--Mr. Garret Graves--to include the Advanced Aviation
Infrastructure Modernization Act. And that gave money to local
governments, Tribal governments to modernize airports. And I
wonder, as this program rolls out, if you could talk about the
potential infrastructure needs that general aviation has, as
opposed to regular commercial airports, when it comes to AAM
technology.
Mr. Crider. Well, I can start. I think, in our example at
Kelly Field, we are building a consolidated facility that has
advanced air mobility attributes to it, so, preparing the
electrical grid and the capacity for charging electrical
vehicles.
I would like to give a shout out, too, though, to the FAA.
I think they have been very thoughtful. We talked about
hydrogen earlier. Electric vehicles are the current. But we
don't know what is going to be in the future. So, I think a
thoughtful consideration about how a hydrogen vehicle or a
solar vehicle or a hybrid vehicle might utilize that
infrastructure, I think, is also well informed. So, those are
the ideas.
And I think, as airports like Kelly do more with advanced
air mobility and connect up with other ecosystems like the
military that is doing great things in advanced air mobility,
and airports that are doing the research and development, the
production, that building out the ecosystem and recognizing
that AAM is an important part of the future and funding it
appropriately is the right thing to do.
Ms. Titus. Thank you.
Anybody else?
Mr. Castagna. I would just add that, in the design and the
build of these facilities, the necessity for standards in the
technology for, let's say, charging systems and connectivity to
the grid between the various different user groups that we are
dealing with, much like we do with aircraft, traditional
aircraft, there is a standardization process there that we
follow.
And so, from a development standpoint of aviation
facilities for AAM at airports, one of the things we are really
looking to understand is what are the infrastructure
requirements, what are the power needs, down to the
connectivity to the actual charging unit, to the aircraft so
that we can bring those technologies to market faster.
Ms. Titus. It is always better to do it in advance than to
have to go back and rehab it down the road. So, I appreciate
that.
Also, I would like to build on something that Ms. Brownley
started asking about. And in the Inflation Reduction Act, we
have a credit for sustainable aviation fuel. And I wonder if
there are any barriers that you all particularly face in
general aviation transitioning from leaded gas, and also if
there should be allocations for GA use.
Mr. Castagna. So, I will start with the SAF piece of that.
Ms. Titus. OK.
Mr. Castagna. So, we greatly appreciate the efforts of
Congress to provide the tax credits, I believe, for 5 years. We
would really like to see those get pushed out, and the
incentives, for 10 years.
The supply chain obstacles that we have in getting that
product to market sooner is one of our challenges. In lieu of
that, we are working with book and claim programs, so that our
users can buy the fuel where they can, and book and claim it
and use it in markets where the fuel is currently not
available.
Ms. Titus. OK.
Mr. Castagna. So, the credits and the incentives to bring
that product to the entire country, where right now it is
really on either coast line is--bringing it to the center of
the country will make it more widely distributed--it will also
make it--the price point of it more competitive.
Mr. Baker. I think there is an opportunity for Congress to
look at--as these new fuel users come online, there are going
to be very small batches of fuel being built. It is not going
to be very competitive, and could cost, probably, a little bit
more than the current supply.
We want to get the transition going as fast as possible and
as safely as possible. So, having some money set aside for
these new fuels to come on board, get them introduced, whether
they need tanks, things like that, I think would be an
important part of the discussion.
Ms. Titus. Thank you.
Well, thank you, and I yield back.
Mr. Owens [presiding]. Thank you, Ms. Titus.
Mr. Mann?
Mr. Mann. Well, thank you all for being here this morning.
I represent the ``Big First'' district of Kansas, which is 60
primarily rural counties, a little bit eastern, a lot in the
central, and the entire western part of our State.
Transportation infrastructure is vitally important.
There is a strong relationship between the Kansas economy
and aviation, has been for decades. Our State system of
commercial service and general aviation airports provide the
gateway to the Nation's air transportation system and the
world's economy for our businesses. Aviation ranked second in
economic impact in our State of Kansas, only after agriculture.
The ``Big First,'' my district, is home to 39 general aviation
airports, with Kansas having a total of 73. Our airports
support thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic
activity, which is why it is imperative that aviation safety
remain a top priority.
One of the FAA's most successful Government industry
partnerships, in my view, is the FAA Contract Tower Program,
which enhances safety in our country, improves air traffic
control services, and has increased savings to taxpayers. There
are currently 262 airports in 46 States that participate in the
Contract Tower Program, which you all know. Eight of those are
located in Kansas. This critical air traffic safety program is
important to maintain and develop general aviation activity,
and supports DoD flight training operations and military
readiness, as well as pilot flight schools all across the
country.
It is also important to note that contract towers account
for approximately one-third of all tower operations in the
Nation, and about 70 percent of contract controllers are
veterans.
A couple of questions for Mr. Crider. What benefits does
the Contract Tower Program provide the National Airspace
System, especially or specifically for the general aviation
community?
Mr. Crider. I think it is a huge part of enhancing safety.
I mean, as I mentioned before, many airports that grow in
operations to the point that they need air traffic separation,
it is a great entry point. So, having that contract tower then
interface with the National Airspace System, talking to centers
and TRACONs and FAA tower facilities, that is all really
important.
So, I think, one, it plays a tremendous role in safety. It
plays a tremendous role in enhancing a system of separation--
air traffic separation. But I think the challenge is that the
program is a few years old now, so, the towers that first
entered that program are aging. They need refurbishment, in
some cases, replacement. So, an investment in that regard--BIL,
again, touches on that. But there is more work to be done.
You mentioned the 200-plus, 260-plus towers across the
country. So, there are pretty vast needs out there for
refurbishment, for replacement, for equipment that helps the
integration of the controllers and workforces as we discussed
earlier.
Mr. Mann. I agree. The nine in Kansas--I have not toured
all of them, but I have toured quite a few of them, and a lot
of them need updating as the technology continues to change.
The second question, and you touched on this, Mr. Crider,
staffing shortages. Labor is tight in a lot of parts of the
country, Kansas is no exception. Staffing shortages continue to
be a challenge throughout the aviation industry, including with
contract towers.
Do you have any thoughts on how FAA and the industry can
work collaboratively to really address staffing challenges at
these towers?
And what do we need to do to really help improve the
situation and to truly move the needle?
Mr. Crider. Well, I think there are some specifics like we
discussed earlier, looking at the labor rates, increasing the
pipeline. But whether it is pilots or controllers or
maintainers, I think the system--and Mr. Castagna touched on
this--it is really a system and a network of labor that is
important.
And I think communities--one example in San Antonio I
mentioned in my testimony, we opened an innovation center that
invites and brings young people to the airport, a couple
hundred yards from Kelly Field, in an environment that
introduces them to STEM and technologies, and robotics, and
cybersecurity, and flight simulators, gaming, all the things
that are transportable to the skill sets in aviation. And I
think that maybe that is transportable to other communities and
other States because, at the end of the day, communities and
airports have the opportunity to integrate some of the great
curriculum, the great touches that we have talked about
earlier, locally.
In our case, Kelly Field has a legacy of being the ladder
to the middle class. So, we are really anxious and passionate
about getting the thousands of young people and students that
come from, frankly, socio-economically depressed communities
through the innovation center, get them excited about
aerospace, excited about robotics, excited about applied
technologies, because our industries that are there on the
campus like Boeing and Standard Air and others, they need that
workforce for the future.
And so, I think that communities can play that role in that
workforce pipeline.
Mr. Mann. I agree. Thank you--again, you all--for being
here. And with that, I yield back.
Mr. Yakym [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Mann. The Chair now
recognizes Mrs. Peltola for 5 minutes.
Mrs. Peltola. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning. This
has been fun listening to this morning. It seems like the
prerequisite to get on this subcommittee is to have logbook
hours, but no pilot's license. That is the trend I am seeing
here.
But I really appreciated your comments, Mr. Baker, and
especially your comments in regard to improving weather cams
and weather stations in Alaska. Even 20 years ago or 10 years
ago, pilots--let's say out of Bethel--would call the village
agent to find out what the weather was. And my favorite answer
was, ``It is good; I can see my four-wheel.''
[Laughter.]
Mrs. Peltola. So, I know agents are being trained to be a
lot more specific about, like, visibility, and ceiling, and
wind direction, and all of that, but we are really grateful for
the weather cams and weather station improvements. Weather can
be fast-changing, as it is everywhere. But in Alaska, you fly
such great distances to get where you are going. I really
appreciate how many comments have been made about the
dependence Alaskans have on our airfields.
But I am wondering, Mr. Baker, if you could share with us
what the committee can do to help these efforts.
Mr. Baker. Thank you on that question. Yes, I have flown
the great State of Alaska on a floatplane every year, and it is
a great place to fly. But those weather cameras are critical,
and looking into those canyons, and understanding if there is a
fog bank, or rain, or moisture, or whatever else is going to
inhibit your ability to stay VFR flying through that part of
Alaska. So, we have had some interruptions from time to time,
where they haven't been able to keep them up. They seem like
they are better today than they have been for a while. But it
is really critical.
We are now starting to take some of that learning from
Alaska, and employ those cameras in the lower 48 in some of the
Rocky Mountain areas, where there is no weather forecasting or
broadcasting, or no station to do that.
So, it is one of the areas of funding for the FAA to make
sure that they can support that, from a safety perspective, in
the lower routes for Alaska, particularly, where the weather is
down an awful lot, as we know, and the rain. But they have now
just put in some lower routes in Alaska, so, you can take a VFR
corridor, and stay at a very low altitude, and know where you
are at.
So, I think the Congress can do--between the things that we
need to get the funding for, like I mentioned before, the
hangars and transient ramp spaces, and things like that that
keep aviation safe and moving, as well as keeping people aware
of all the weather things.
Mrs. Peltola. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back my
time. Thank you.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mrs. Peltola. The Chair now
recognizes Mr. D'Esposito for 5 minutes.
Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning,
everyone. It is still morning.
I represent the Fourth Congressional District on Long
Island in New York. My district is just blocks away from JFK
Airport, and most of my constituents, if they are flying
anywhere, would utilize LaGuardia, JFK, or perhaps MacArthur
out in Islip.
On January 13th, two planes had a close call at JFK
Airport. A Delta flight had to abort its takeoff when an
American Airlines flight had crossed over into its path from an
adjacent taxiway. They were approximately 1,000 feet from one
another, which is, obviously, dangerously close. Thanks to the
staff at the tower, the Delta plane was able to cancel their
trajectory before any serious damage occurred.
A few days later, a JetBlue plane scheduled to depart from
JFK bumped into an unoccupied aircraft. The airlines and the
FAA say this happened during pushback, which occurs when an
aircraft is pushed back from its parked position at the gate
before heading toward the tarmac to take flight. Thankfully, no
one was hurt. However, these events underscore the importance
of runway safety.
Mr. Baker, what additional measure can the FAA do to ensure
we have runway safety measures in place at our airports?
Because it seems like these issues are happening more often.
Mr. Baker. Certainly, there are a lot of new players and
people in aviation today, and making sure that the training is
in place at all of these different activities, whether it be at
control tower, whether it be the ramp management.
The good news is aviation is growing and booming. The other
thing that comes along with that is a lot of new players.
Mr. D'Esposito. Understood.
Mr. Baker. So, reinforcing the training.
Mr. D'Esposito. OK, thank you. And what are the AOPA's
priorities for the FAA reauthorization that will advance
implementing safety measures, as well as training?
Mr. Baker. So, again, the big things that we believe in
safety--the number-one thing is keeping low-lead fuel available
until we have the safe transition to the unleaded fuel. It is
the number-one priority, because we believe we should get rid
of low-lead fuel, but we need to do it in a safe, meaningful,
methodical way, an airport at a time. And to get the funding in
place to make sure that that happens is the number-one safety
issue that we look at for the Congress to give guidance to.
Mr. D'Esposito. OK, thank you.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. D'Esposito. The Chair now
recognizes Mr. Johnson for 5 minutes.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for
holding this hearing. And I thank the witnesses for your time
and attention, and for your testimony.
While commercial aviation consumes much of our attention,
it is general aviation that plays a huge role in providing
foundational flight activities such as business travel,
humanitarian aid, environmental conservation, and many others.
DeKalb-Peachtree Airport is in my district in Georgia, and
has averaged about 228,000 operations per year over the past 30
years. It is the second busiest airport in the State of Georgia
in its number of operations, only behind Hartsfield-Jackson
Atlanta International Airport. Only 8 miles from the heart of
downtown Atlanta, this airport makes it the airport of choice
for general aviation operators visiting the Atlanta
metropolitan area.
I have some questions. Mr. Castagna, you mentioned that
there was a huge workforce shortage in aviation. Is that
correct?
Mr. Castagna. Yes, sir. We are experiencing workforce
shortages, from the ramp worker to the pilot community.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. And do you find, generally, that
the aviation workforce is underrepresented in terms of people
of color and women?
Mr. Castagna. So, our position is we believe that a diverse
workforce is certainly a resilient workforce. And the efforts
that have been made in the last few years in working with
different groups, the Tuskegee Airmen and the Women in Aviation
groups, and bringing more persons of color and women into this
aviation industry is certainly important to our organization. I
think all of us here at the table feel that that is a critical
role.
I think it ties to the going back into the schools and into
the younger--and introducing aviation in all different
workforces at all levels and attract them. We were mentioning
the air traffic control and what can we do to increase that. It
really opened the kimono, introduced the air traffic control
world down to those community groups, and opened them up. The
FAA had a program that's, I don't think, active now during the
pandemic, where you could actually book tours and go visit air
traffic control facilities and bring student groups to go see
those. Doing that and bringing inner city school kids, and
bringing kids from high schools to that will certainly open the
door of interest.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. OK, thank you.
How about you, Mr. Baker? In terms of the pilots, do you
find the same dilemma exists?
Mr. Baker. Yes, I am very excited, though, that our high
school initiative, which is about 40 percent young people of
color that are taking these classes, STEM education, because
they see the career opportunities, and the opportunities have
never been richer and better. And 25 percent young women, which
is a category--we only have 5 percent of our whole pilots that
are women today. So, it is really a new opportunity.
But you have to bring that to them to show them the
pathways exist for them to get onto this program. So, that is
why it is really critically important we get the support of the
NCAA to get this thing rolled out to 2,500 high schools around
this country.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Yes, because, I mean, it is a fact
that our country is becoming more diverse. And if we don't
target underrepresented groups--and they may be
underrepresented for whatever the reason might be, but if we
fail to reach out to try to recruit or try to inspire folks, we
are doing ourselves and our industry a disservice.
And so, I just want to apologize to everyone for sinking
into just a small bit of wokeness. I am so sorry.
Now, Mr. Pelton, what impact does limited airport
infrastructure funding have on general aviation airports?
Mr. Pelton. I am probably not the best served to answer
that, but the immediate need is if we believe that our 5,000
current general aviation airports are critical to the
infrastructure of this country, we need to make sure that we
maintain them as we do with our road systems or any of our
other infrastructure. So, it is critically important, because a
lot of these areas, that is a vital link, whether it be for
medical services or rescue or other issues.
So, we should be making equal investments in our 5,000
public-use airports around the country, other than the major
airports. Otherwise, we are letting our infrastructure
deteriorate.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, and my time has expired.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. The Chair now recognizes
Mr. Kean for 5 minutes.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
My district starts, really, 20 minutes away from the Newark
Airport, and has many other local airports within its
boundaries. And I think we all certainly understand that
general aviation is the backbone of the United States aviation
system, as it contains pilot training, workforce training, and
emerging technologies for safe skies, and as general aviation
supports more than 1.2 million jobs and contributes
approximately $128 billion to the United States GDP.
On the issue of so many middle class families in my
district and across the country being impacted by the inflation
rate when they are sitting around their dining room tables, but
many do not realize that the inflation is hitting the aviation
and the aviation construction industry, as well.
Mr. Crider, can you please tell us about how inflation and
rising construction costs continue to undermine the ability for
general aviation airports to complete projects, thus hurting
the communities that they are intended to serve?
Mr. Crider. Absolutely. I think the short answer is that
the dollar just doesn't go as far with inflation and, frankly,
competition.
One of the unintended consequences of so much investment in
infrastructure is that airports compete with road projects and
many other dimensions to get those needed pieces of work done.
I think, back to the funding level, if you look at the
basic AIP entitlement for general aviation airports, it has
been about $150,000 for the last 23 years. So, to your point,
sir, $150,000 23 years ago, what that buys you today is
radically reduced. So, I think a focus on both changing those
formulas--because you have some very large airports, we talked
earlier about Peachtree, Kelly Fields is another great example.
We have large-scale commercial aircraft that operate from those
GA airports. Understanding and differentiating how that
entitlement and that funding works is important.
And then also recognizing that there is both pressure on
competition and inflation at play that just doesn't buy you as
much as it did a few years ago.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. So, as a follow up, therefore, do
you think that there should be more flexibility in how airports
are permitted to use AIP and IIJA funding in recognition of
these evolving needs?
And specifically, what type of flexibility should this
committee consider?
Mr. Crider. I do. I think, as we talked before about the
regulatory process, getting approval to build projects, but
also where those funds are directed, relying on airport
sponsors to invest those dollars most appropriately. That
speaks to eligibility items and, frankly, a recognition of
facets like industrial airports, infrastructure that supports
large job centers and commerce that is essential to our system.
I think those are some areas for improvement, but greater
flexibility overall, the ability to invest wisely, appropriate
to that specific community and airport.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. OK. Thank you, and thank you for
the panel for being here today.
I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Kean. The Chair now recognizes
Ms. Holmes Norton for 5 minutes.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Castagna, as cochair of the Quiet Skies Caucus, I am
glad you brought up advanced air mobility and the ability of
new aircraft designed to limit aviation noise. Can you speak
more to the benefits of AAM technologies and the necessity of
integrating them into the regulatory system of the FAA and the
infrastructure of general aviation airports?
Mr. Castagna. Thank you, Congresswoman. Airports in urban
communities are certainly challenged by the continued need to
maximize their economic potential and opportunities in
workforce development, and at the same time mitigate to the
best of their abilities environmental impacts to their
neighborhoods such as noise and other issues.
AAM provides a huge opportunity to airports, if the
infrastructure can be brought in to support the electric
aircraft or hydrogen and these new technologies, which are
ultimately going to reduce the footprint of noise in these
neighborhoods because those aircraft are significantly quieter.
So, the advent of electric aircraft or hydrogen aircraft
and these technologies will have, ultimately, a direct impact
to airport operations, where airports themselves are the
natural introduction point for these types of activities. Where
they ultimately want to establish footholds inside communities
off-airport, the airport provides the first opportunity for the
AAM community to introduce operations into the airspace system.
Ms. Norton. Thank you.
Mr. Baker, in your testimony you mentioned the need to
maintain a qualified workforce in the general aviation sector.
You reported that nearly half of AOPA Foundation's curriculum
students are students of color, and 20 percent are women. What
measures are AOPA and others in the general aviation sector
taking to increase diversity in training and hiring to meet the
employment goals of companies like Boeing?
Mr. Baker. So, I believe that the opportunity for the whole
industry--and again, under the form of the National Center for
the Advancement of Aviation--is getting everybody on the same
page. We see lots of young people that want to be in these
aviation careers. And we have seen the success of our program
in the 9th to the 12th grade.
And again, many inner city schools, rural schools, home
schools, all kinds of high schools--we are now in 400. I think
the opportunity to be in 1 out of every 10--2,500 high schools
in this country--is a real opportunity to create that exposure,
create the pathways, and get the whole industry working
together to solve this problem and create opportunities that
have never been better.
Ms. Norton. Thank you for that response.
Mr. Crider, you mentioned that Port San Antonio has
expanded its outreach to recruit students in lower socio-
economic status in order to build up the industry's workforce.
How has this recruitment to underserved communities benefited
the maintenance of your workforce?
Mr. Crider. Well, I think it has been a success. The
innovation center I described earlier not only introduces young
people to careers and opportunities of the future, it provides
a place and a space for industrial aerospace operators to
recruit.
So, we have experienced a variety of internships, hands-on
experiences, as well as just direct awareness of opportunities.
So, it is really connective tissue. The innovation center
serves as a place to introduce students, but it also allows
great organizations like AOPA, EAA, Ninety-Nines, Girls Inc.,
many of those communities that have the diversity that the
companies desire, it brings them together and allows a
recruiting forum so that a pathway to success is established.
And that may be internships, that may be exposure, that may be
just counsel. So, it is really a space where all those things
can happen.
Ms. Norton. Thank you very much. My time has expired.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Ms. Norton. The Chair now recognizes
Ms. Davids.
Ms. Davids of Kansas. Thank you, and thank you to our
witnesses today for coming.
And we have heard a lot about the FAA reauthorization that
is coming up. And it is, obviously, a critical piece of
legislation for the entire country. But I definitely appreciate
the opportunity to have a discussion about the future of our
national airspace and what that might look like.
And obviously, we all want the United States to continue to
be the gold standard, but we are going to have a challenge--we
have heard a little bit about this--of constructing, well,
constructing things, but also of constructing a bill that is
going to promote these innovative technologies that we have
and, certainly, the businesses that are right here at home that
can do that.
One of the things that I have been very focused on and was
very happy and proud to get to work on in the last session of
Congress with now chairman of this subcommittee, Garret Graves,
was the Advanced Air Mobility Coordination and Leadership Act.
And we got that across the finish line. It is going to
establish an interagency working group to plan and coordinate
those efforts. And again, we have heard a bunch about this
already.
And so, I do want to--Mr. Castagna, I know in your written
testimony, you talked about NATA's Advanced Air Mobility
Committee. And then we heard you, I think, when Mr. Stanton was
asking about the recommendations that you all might be making.
I am definitely very curious about not just the role that your
Advanced Air Mobility Committee is going to be playing, but how
you think we should be integrating and looking at the issues or
problems, and then those recommendations. Because I think right
now, with such new technology, it might surprise folks to know
that the Federal Government is not always on the cutting edge
of these things, and I would hate to see what happened when
drones were really starting to come on the scene to similarly
happen with advanced air mobility. So, if you want to, talk a
little bit about that.
And Mr. Crider, I know you have some comments and thoughts.
If you want to expand on those, because I know you started
talking a little bit about the infrastructure needs that we are
going to have going forward.
Mr. Castagna. Thank you. I would just start by saying, so,
we established the committee, since we have existing members
that are flying traditional aircraft for charter and other
types of activities, where we see there is a nexus between
those operators following those same Federal guidelines that
would apply to the AAM community. So, having those two
community groups talking to each other, and where we could
support one another for that integration, we thought, was
critical.
As well, the AAM community needs to work through the
certification process for their aircraft, and we know that that
has been a challenge. Just from the traditional aircraft
process, we know that they are in that same complicated
network, and it is delaying their integration into the
airspace.
And then lastly, I would just say, for our businesses that
are based at the airport, introducing those two into the
airspace in such a way that we can introduce them to
communities and establishing, let's say, arrival and departure
procedures and things that are sensitive to an airport's
community and can operate safely and efficiently, that is the
natural course where we believe it should start.
But we ultimately know that AAM wants to branch out beyond
the airport boundaries, out into communities to operate. But
the airport environment provides that first exposure to do so,
and introduce it safely.
Mr. Crider. And on that a little bit, I think an
intentional investment and funding that addresses AAM is
prudent. We don't want to be in a situation where investment in
advanced air mobility reprioritizes or shuffles or subordinates
safety projects and other needed projects. But I think an
intentional investment in that is important.
We are, as I mentioned before, investing in a facility that
accommodates AAM, in addition to other things. But I think more
of that, as the vehicles come online, and also an awareness
that it is electric today, but it is going to be--who knows
what the future will bring.
Ms. Davids of Kansas. Thank you. And Mr. Castagna--lasagna,
Castagna, I was trying--I probably will want to follow up,
because I am running out of time, about those certifications.
Which part the certifications will come under as we look at
AAM, and trying to make sure that we are--just that this
committee and the folks on the T&I Committee in general
understand what that process is looking like for you all as you
are trying to work through it. I know it is with the FAA, but--
--
Mr. Castagna [interrupting]. I would be happy to have our
staff reach out to you, as well as----
Ms. Davids of Kansas [interposing]. Thank you.
Mr. Castagna [continuing]. Our sister organization, GAMA,
the General Aviation Manufacturers Association. So, it is part
23 of the Federal process.
Ms. Davids of Kansas. OK. Thank you so much.
I yield back.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Ms. Davids. The Chair now recognizes
Mr. Payne for 5 minutes.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and congratulations on
being chosen as vice chairman of this committee.
Mr. Castagna, how is that? That's close? All right. As a
cosponsor of Mr. Larsen's Advanced Aviation Infrastructure
Modernization Act, I was pleased to read in the testimony of
your support of adding electric vertical takeoff and landing,
or eVTOL, aircraft into our air system.
Is it possible that commercial vertical vehicle service
could begin in the next few years under the FAA
reauthorization?
Mr. Castagna. So, we know that there are a number of
participants in the AAM space. There are several hundred, in
some cases, of these manufacturers. We know there is going to
be a lot of consolidation in the manufacturing world. But at
the top of the pinnacle today of those different companies,
some are farther along in their certification process. Some
have aspirations to being in the air on the west coast, where
there is a large focus for the Olympics, where they introduced
this model for transportation.
So, to answer your question, I think it is realistically
possible. I don't think it will be widespread throughout the
country, but I think you will see it in certain urban markets,
where they see an opportunity where the connectivity to the
urban air mobility for various transportation modes can take
place.
Mr. Payne. Thank you. And in light of this, what priorities
should the committee consider that would make this
transportation successful and sustainable?
Mr. Castagna. So, I think the conformity or consistency in
the regulations that exist today that we are operating under
for part 135 and in other types of regulations, including the
certification, that we apply those standards consistently to
those operators so that they are following the same path as our
traditional aircraft operations are.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
Mr. Crider, are airports ready to add this service?
And what else can this committee do to help you add these
new aircraft to your operations?
Mr. Crider. Well, I would say it is a mixed bag. There are
some airports that are very, very aggressive in seeking these
new technologies and setting up systems, Kelly Field being one
of them. But there are others out there that are anxious to
integrate those vehicles into the system. There are others that
are waiting to see. So, it is definitely a mixed bag.
But I think, as Mr. Castagna said, that being ready for
that through electrical grid, through standards, through
standardization of charging stations, the takeoff and landing
processes and the procedures, all that standardization and all
that pre-work, it is not too early to start. So, I think that
that is the work before us, as was said here today.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
And now, Mr. Baker, over the past few years we have seen a
huge increase in the commercial use of uncrewed systems, both
remotely piloted and autonomous. How can this committee help
prepare the general aviation pilots to deal with these new
entrants to our airspace?
Mr. Baker. So, we welcome all the new entrants into the
airspace. We think it is good for the economy. We think it is
good for the technology that we can apply to general aviation,
as well.
One of the things that we feel very strongly about is we
don't want to add any more technology into the cockpit of a
busy airplane, the busiest time, when you are below 500 feet
coming and going from an airport. So, by not requiring any,
mandating more equipment--we already have ADS-B. What we have
always done in general aviation is see and avoid or detect and
avoid. Those rules still have to apply as we add new entrants
to the airspace.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
And Mr. Chairman, I am excited. I am actually going to
yield back 32 seconds. Thank you.
Mr. Yakym. Very well done, Mr. Payne. I am impressed. The
Chair now recognizes Mr. Carbajal for 5 minutes.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I will take those extra
seconds. I am kidding.
Mr. Crider, as we move forward with advancements in
technology, specifically low- and zero-emission aircraft and
sustainable aviation fuels, SAF, we have an opportunity to
decarbonize our skies to make air travel greener. Some of the
new developments include full or hybrid-electric aircrafts,
which the FAA is working to develop a regulatory framework for
certification and operation of them.
From your perspective, what are the infrastructure needs to
promote SAF and the use of hybrid or fully electric aircraft?
And do you have any specific recommendations for us as we
draft the FAA reauthorization?
Mr. Crider. Well, I think for the fuels, the fuels piece,
certainly the infrastructure, the fuel systems being prepared
for that transition, again, not prematurely, but being ready
for when the transition takes place.
On the electric and the emerging technologies front,
electrification is going to be the big thing, especially at
commercial airports that are already facing demands for
electric charging stations, for vehicles, for rental cars, for
privately owned vehicles. So, that is only amplified by the
electric vertical takeoff and landing, which have a fairly high
requirement for electricity.
So, I think capacity in the grid, ability to charge,
compatibility from one aircraft to the other, standards, those
are all things that are important next steps, and perhaps
opportunities for this reauthorization bill to consider.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. Mr. Crider, the Airport
Improvement Program is a critical source of Federal funding for
capital airport projects. In your written testimony, you have
an extensive list of recommendations to improve that program.
One of your recommendations to this committee is that we
increase the authorized levels of Airport Improvement Program
to $4 billion annually. Can you elaborate on the needs to
increase the authorization?
Mr. Crider. Yes, sir. Yes, I think that recent history has
proven that there are many great projects that absorb
supplemental appropriations, discretionary appropriations, the
BIL work. More work has yet to be done, though.
I think we have had a fairly stagnant level of basic AIP
for the last few years--so, $3.35 billion, I believe is the
baseline. So, increasing to $4 billion, in our opinion, makes
great sense on a number of fronts. Its recalibration of the
formulas, the formula for GA airports, but also medium and
large-hub airports. So, a bit of a recalibration, if you will,
that recognizes the different level of investment required at
airports of a wide variety, and a variety of activity levels.
So, yes, we think $4 billion is certainly warranted, in
addition to the supplemental appropriations that we have seen
in the last few years.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Mr. Baker, you have made great points on the impacts of the
general aviation industry. It is an economic driver and
supports more than 1.2 million jobs. But you also discussed
workforce gaps and the need to train the next generation of
pilots. How can Congress help support this, and what
partnerships can we increase with schools across the country to
achieve that goal?
Mr. Baker. OK, a couple of those things are important.
Thank you again for that question and the point of view.
We still believe we have got an opportunity today to make
general aviation even better by having transient ramp spots at
all these airports, so people can come and go to all these
5,000 public-use airports unencumbered by some of the FBO costs
that we see today.
But we look at the opportunity to grow aviation and bring
young people into aviation. I think the NCAA bill, which nearly
passed the House last year with 400 votes, should get through
today in Congress to support a bigger, broader way of bringing
high school education to more than 2,500 high schools, more
than 10 percent of the high schools that exist in this country,
giving everybody a pathway and an opportunity to join this
great career: aviation.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I yield back.
Mr. Yakym. I thank the gentleman for yielding.
Are there any further questions from members of the
subcommittee who have not been recognized?
Seeing none, that concludes our hearing for today. I would
like to thank each of the witnesses for your testimony.
I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing
remain open until such time as our witnesses have provided any
answers to questions that may have been submitted to them in
writing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 days for any additional comments and information
submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in the record
of today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
The subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:18 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Submissions for the Record

----------

Statement of Gregory Pecoraro, President and Chief Executive Officer,
National Association of State Aviation Officials, Submitted for the
Record by Hon. Garret Graves
Chairmen Graves and Graves, Ranking Members Larsen and Cohen, and
members of the Subcommittee on Aviation, thank you for the opportunity
to share my thoughts on behalf of the National Association of State
Aviation Officials (NASAO) regarding the future of general aviation.
For the past 92 years, NASAO has represented state government
aviation agencies in all 50 states, Guam and Puerto Rico. Like you, in
your roles on this subcommittee, we serve the public interest. State
aviation agencies play a critical role in managing the National
Aviation System, from developing state-wide aviation system plans to
performing airport safety inspections on behalf of the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) of general aviation airports.
In addition to these activities, state aviation agencies work
closely with the general aviation airports in their states in a variety
of ways. General aviation airports often lack the staffing and
expertise available to larger airports and rely on their state aviation
agencies for a wide range of technical support and guidance, as well as
for assistance in interacting with the FAA. For example, ten states
administer block grants for FAA Airport Improvement Program (AIP)
grants to general aviation airports, many others act as channeling
states \1\ for the FAA where they work with the airport to accept and
distribute grant funds, and most states provide funds to help meet the
matching requirements for FAA AIP grants.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ State channeling of federal airport grants occurs in various
forms within numerous states. Normally, when an airport is in a
channeling act state, the sponsor submits payment request information
to the state, who then submits the request to the FAA. In this case,
the FAA makes payments to the state, and the state then distributes the
payment to the sponsor. In some cases the state may also provide
technical oversight and review, which may include state submittal of
grant applications and/or closeout requests. This is based on state
enabling legislation, rather than federal law. In many cases, the state
also signs the grant agreements. Channeling agreements based on state
enabling legislation do not need approval from the FAA Airport District
Office (ADO). AIP Handbook, Chapter 2, https://www.faa.gov/airports/
aip/aip_handbook/?Chapter=2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This testimony will focus on the top three policies that state
aviation agencies believe would have the greatest impact on general
aviation in their states if enacted: (1) increase Airport Improvement
Program (AIP) funding levels; (2) modernize the Nonprimary Entitlement
(NPE) Program; and (3) invest now to prepare for the next generation of
aircraft. NASAO has also developed a list of recommendations for
Congress to consider as you craft a FAA reauthorization bill, which is
included at the end the testimony.
Continue Investments in Airport Infrastructure
NASAO urges Congress to increase funding levels for the Airport
Improvement Program (AIP) to a minimum of $4 billion annually. The AIP
funding levels have remained stagnant for a decade at $3.35 billion a
year. While funding levels have remained stagnant, construction and
material costs continue to rise. There continues to be a great need for
federal investment in our nation's airport infrastructure as there is
more than $62 billion in AIP and IIJA-eligible projects from now until
2027 \2\. Our general aviation airports have unmet needs for
construction, repair, and maintenance of runway, taxiways, and other
AIP eligible projects. Looking to the future, general aviation airports
must transform into greener, more sustainable facilities, as well as
increase their connection to a multi-modal transportation system. This
will take much needed focus and increased investments for this to
happen.

Airport Systems (2023-2027), p. 3, https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/
files/npias-2023-2027-narrative.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
State aviation agencies also urge Congress to reauthorize
supplemental discretionary airport infrastructure grants and ensure 50
percent of funds are used for non-hub and small hub airports and
general aviation airports. These funds go a long way for non-hub and
small hub airports that are not able to leverage other funding sources,
like the Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) fees and bonds.
Modernize the Nonprimary Entitlement (NPE) Program
General aviation, nonprimary commercial and reliever airports rely
on the Nonprimary Entitlement (NPE) Program for minimal level of a
capital funding. Unfortunately, the NPE program has not changed since
its inception in the early 2000s. It needs to be modernized to meet to
the current needs of general aviation airports. The NPE program
provides up to $150,000 annually from AIP to general aviation,
reliever, and nonprimary commercial service airports for critical
projects that would otherwise go unfunded. However, in today's
environment, these annual NPE grants are so small that they must be
carried over for a period of years to accumulate up to $600,000 to go
toward an airport project. More meaningful paving projects are starting
at $1 million today. For example, in Louisiana, John H. Hooks Jr.
Memorial Airport is in need of a runway rehabilitation due to pavement
and base challenges. The cost estimate for the runway rehabilitation
was nearly eight times the maximum amount of entitlements that could be
accrued. In Missouri, many of the National Plan of Integrated Airport
Systems (NPIAS) airports that are planning projects have had to break
the projects in half or phase them due to the yearly NPE funds not
being enough to meet the current construction prices. This greatly
increases the overall cost of the pavement maintenance due to paying
for mobilization, bidding, and design twice. If the NPE program is to
provide airports with a meaningful opportunity to make improvements in
a cost-efficient way, the program must be reformed to ensure that these
airport projects are moving forward.
NASAO proposes modernizing the program by increasing the funding
levels to airports with more activity: $1 million for national
airports, $500,000 for commercial service non-primary airports,
$500,000 for regional airports, $250,000 for local airports, $150,000
for basic airports, and $0 for unclassified airports. Equally important
is increasing State Apportionment at the same proportion to ensure that
an increase in NPE does not further reduce State Apportionment funds.
Raising overall AIP funding levels above $4 billion annually will be
critical to implementing this proposal.
NASAO also urges Congress to include language that would allow for
the option of airport sponsors to transfer unused NPE funds to State
aviation agencies and make them available to NPIAS airports within
their state. This will ensure that this funding that was intended for
the state remains in the state.
Preparing for Advanced Air Mobility
Congress has recognized the importance of this new era of aviation
by enacting the Advanced Air Mobility Leadership and Coordination Act
and the Advanced Aviation Infrastructure Modernization Act. NASAO is
grateful for Congress' action on these two important bills to continue
to keep the United States at the forefront of aviation.
State aviation agencies and airport sponsors have an important role
to play in facilitating AAM and need assistance with this
transformational challenge. They will need access to expertise and
funding to plan for airport transformation, charging for eVTOL
aircraft, electrification of ground support equipment, on airport clean
power generation, and EV charging for airport parking facilities.
Congress should encourage and fund the development and implementation
of these solutions by directing the FAA to develop plans and policies
and identify how to make federal funding available to support both on
and off airport development for AAM. With both electric and hydrogen
propelled aircraft in development, it is critical that the FAA start
planning how it will support airports and off airport transportation
nodes with these new infrastructure needs.
It is also vital that Congress continues to support integration of
these new technologies by tasking the FAA with establishing national
standards to address AAM airspace coordination and control. Established
standards will help the system to expand more rapidly as AAM aircraft
become certified. Federal expectations and rules for this new
technology must be developed and shared with all stakeholders soon, and
it is critical for state and local governments to be part of the
conversation in integrating these technologies into the larger
transportation system.
As planning will be an initial crucial step in facilitating AAM, we
need to ensure that FAA sets infrastructure standards that can be
applied across the nation in order for states and other stakeholders to
conduct more in depth planning for the facility requirements. Some of
this planning will require airport sponsors or vertiport managers to
study their existing electrical grid to see what needs to be done to
upgrade power or bring in additional power for electric vehicles,
ground support equipment, public transportation and electric aircraft.
NASAO urges Congress to charge the FAA to provide states baseline
standards to assist with the infrastructure planning requirements to
accommodate AAM, such as electrical requirements and charging
standards.
In closing, Congress has an opportunity with an FAA reauthorization
bill to help set general aviation airports on a path that will enable
them to not only improve the current infrastructure but prepare for the
future of aviation. We appreciate the Subcommittee's focus and support
of the general aviation community. NASAO looks forward to continuing to
work with you in the upcoming FAA reauthorization bill. Thank you for
your consideration.
NASAO's FAA Reauthorization Proposals
Provide Robust Aviation Funding

Increase Airport Improvement Program (AIP) investment to
not less than $4 billion annually. The cost of construction has risen
over the years, but we are spending less through the Airport
Improvement Program (AIP) on airport infrastructure than we did in past
years. An increase would enable states to not only update existing
infrastructure but upgrade that infrastructure to take advantage of new
aeronautical technologies that will keep the United States in the
forefront of global aviation.

Reauthorize supplemental discretionary airport
infrastructure grants and ensure 50 percent of funds are used for non-
hub and small hub airports and general aviation airports. These funds
will go a long way for non-hub and small hub airports that are not able
to leverage other funding sources, like Passenger Facility Charge (PFC)
fees and bonds, to address their infrastructure needs.

Continue to apportion AIP funding based on airports'
calendar year 2019 or 2020 or 2021 passenger enplanements, whichever is
highest, for FY 2024 to 2026 (consistent with the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law). This would ensure that airports continue to remain
eligible for AIP and are able to fund critical airport safety projects.

Raise and index the Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) rates
at commercial service airports. Raising the PFC cap would give small
airports, who have less options to raise airport revenue, a greater
share of AIP entitlement funds. Large commercial service airports would
be able to collect and use PFC revenue for airport infrastructure and
forgo their AIP entitlements.
Modernize the Non-Primary Entitlement (NPE) Program
To ensure that the Non-Primary Entitlement (NPE) program better
meets the needs of non-primary airports, NASAO urges Congress to:

Increase the funding levels to airports with more
activity ($1 million for national airports, $500,000 for commercial
service non-primary airports, $500,000 for regional airports, $250,000
for local airports, $150,000 for basic airports, and $0 for
unclassified airports) and correspondingly increase State Apportionment
to ensure that an increase in NPE does not further reduce State
Apportionment funds. The General Aviation (GA) entitlement portion of
AIP is divided into two categories: State Apportionment and Non-Primary
Entitlement (NPE). NPE grants are available for general aviation,
reliever, and nonprimary commercial service airports at up to $150,000
per year. The remainder of the funds are then allocated for State
Apportionment and go to the highest priority projects that are
determined through a sound and established planning formula. These
grants have been very effective at preserving an important component of
the nation's aviation system. However, NPE grants must be carried over
for a period of years to provide adequate funding for most airport
improvement projects given that the buying power of these funds has
decreased significantly since the program was established. In addition,
State Apportionment has seen year-over-year reductions since the
inception of the NPE program in 2001. It will be critical for Congress
to address both NPE and State Apportionment funding levels when looking
at enhancing the NPE program. Increasing the funding levels of these
two programs will ensure that these airports are able to begin critical
shovel-ready improvement projects sooner rather than later.

Allow for the option of airport sponsors to transfer
unused NPE funds to State aviation agencies and make them available to
National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) airports within
their state. Non-primary airports can bank/carryover these funds for up
to four years to accumulate $600,000. When non-primary airports have
expired NPE funds, these funds are transferred to FAA's discretionary
fund for use by FAA in that fiscal year. This proposal would ensure
that these funds are invested in the respective states as intended.
Prepare for a New Era of Aviation
To ensure that the United States is ready for the next generation
of aircraft and the states and localities are able to adequately
prepare for these new aircraft, NASAO urges Congress to:
Advanced Air Mobility (AAM)

Task the FAA with developing plans and policies and
identify how to make federal funding available to support both on and
off airport development for AAM. With both electric and hydrogen
propelled aircraft in development, it is critical that the FAA start
planning how it will support airports and off airport transportation
nodes with these new infrastructure needs.

Charge the FAA with providing states baseline standards
to assist with the infrastructure planning requirements to accommodate
AAM, such as electrical requirements, and charging standards. Planning
that could be accomplished now at airports and within communities will
help speed up the incorporation of AAM aircraft as they become
available.

Require the FAA to establish a national standard to
address advanced air mobility (AAM) airspace coordination and control
informed by the ongoing work of the Advanced Aviation Advisory
Committee. Allowing for third party providers operating under the
guidance of the FAA and the established standards would enable the
federated system to expand more rapidly as AAM aircraft become
certified while maintaining the appropriate level of safety.
Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS)

Require the FAA to establish an outline for a
constructive Federal regulatory framework for drone integration
strategies that support the application of a low-altitude drone
activity and require the FAA to work collaboratively with states to
develop an acceptable framework. The role of state government in
integrating UAS technology into the airspace has been recognized by the
inclusion of NASAO designees on the relevant UAS advisory and
rulemaking committees. NASAO believes that a constructive federal,
state, local partnership can be reached by the levels of government
proactively working with industry stakeholders.

Authorize a grant program that provides not less than
$100 million to state, local, and tribal governments to purchase drones
for infrastructure inspection purposes and not less than $100 million
to community colleges/universities to support drone education and
workforce training programs. State aviation agencies recognize the
value in and are looking to leverage drone technology to inspect ageing
infrastructure. This grant program will support the efforts of state,
local, and tribal governments to capitalize on those benefits while
investing in workforce development programs to bolster the workforce of
the future.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Continue federal support of SAF development and
production to significantly reduce harmful greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions and ultra fine particulate matter. SAF is a viable bridging
strategy to reduce carbon emissions while AAM aircraft have time to
mature.
Ensure Air Service to Small Communities

Allow communities that successfully exited EAS and were
then locked out of EAS due to provisions in the FAA Modernization and
Reform Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-95) to rejoin the program to help restore
scheduled air service that has been reduced or suspended as a result of
the pandemic.

NASAO urges Congress to continue investments in the
Essential Air Service (EAS), Small Community Air Service Development
(SCASDP), and the Contract Tower Programs. These programs ensure small
communities have access to commercial air service.

NASAO urges Congress to address the aviation workforce
shortage, including the pilot shortage.
Provide Federal Support for PFAS Clean-up Efforts at Airports

Implement federally assisted clean-up programs for PFAS
contamination at airports stemming from FAA-required use of
firefighting foams containing PFAS, including airports that were not
required to, but used the FAA-approved firefighting foam as a best
practice. In addition, NASAO urges Congress to review and provide
liability protections for all U.S. airports faced with this challenge.
While some progress has been made in identifying PFAS as an emerging
contaminant, direct federal support of all airports (separate from the
Airport Improvement Program) is needed to accelerate the clean-up
process at contaminated sites. Not only are airports faced with
difficult choices when called upon to extinguish fires using the only
FAA-approved firefighting foams, airports are now subject to
environmental enforcement actions in many states, harming the viability
of the national transportation system. Airports should not be held
liable for PFAS contamination as a result of complying with a federal
requirement.
Enhance Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) Implementation

Provide administrative funding to States to assist with
implementation. States' workload has doubled since the pandemic with
the flow of federal funds to airports, which has strained State
aviation agencies' resources and staff. Many States are concerned about
the inadequate staff levels that they currently have to implement IIJA.
Regardless of a State aviation agencies' status (e.g., Block Grant
State or Channeling State), program funding assistance to States is
needed to ensure IIJA funds is efficiently and effectively rolled out.

Ensure funds are spent efficiently by allowing airports
to transfer IIJA funds between airports, including the option for State
aviation agencies to assist in transferring funds between airports in
their State. The IIJA does not address the issue of transferring funds,
but FAA's FAQ states that airports are not allowed to do this. Without
being able to transfer funds between airports, we may see many airports
carry over funds year to year and are trying to complete projects in
year 4 and 5, which could create a shortage of contractors and increase
prices because many airports are trying to complete projects at the
same time. Allowing those State aviation agencies who are willing to
assist airports within in their States to transfer funds will also help
ensure that funds are spent efficiently. Several States have been using
this tool successfully for many years with AIP entitlement funds.
Improve Weather Observation Resiliency and Redundancy

Direct the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to
review the Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) and Automated
Weather Observing System (AWOS) and provide recommendations on how to
improve the reliability and redundancy of the system. The ASOS \3\
(jointly managed program by the National Weather Service (NWS), FAA,
and U.S. Department of Defense) and AWOS (airport-owned and managed
system that compliments ASOS) are the country's primary surface weather
observing network supporting weather forecast activities and aviation
operations (e.g., regional air carriers and cargo operators). Both
systems are aging and in need of updated infrastructure. While the FAA/
NWS are in the process of updating ASOS, States and airports are facing
challenges in updating its AWOS infrastructure as the lack of suppliers
and cost of installing and maintaining the systems is becoming
unmanageable. For example, when a weather station goes down, it can
take up to a week before flights can resume due to delays in acquiring
and installing replacement parts. A study is needed to address the
complexity of the challenges of this critical weather reporting system
as it's an integral part of ensuring safety in our aviation system. The
need for and importance of affordable weather reporting will only grow
as vertiports are integrated into the National Airspace System.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ ASOS reports basic weather elements such as sky conditions,
visibility, present weather conditions, visual obstructions, barometric
pressure, ambient temperature, wind speed and direction, and
precipitation. With more than 900 ASOS sites in the United States,
these automated systems are critical to providing weather information
at airports.

Direct the FAA to provide aviation weather observer
training to interested candidates to improve access to the program,
thereby ensuring aircraft operation safety at rural airports. Aviation
weather observers detect and track weather conditions to back up the
ASOS system. Having aviation weather observers available to support
weather observations when an ASOS experiences an outage due to repair/
replacement or unexpected downtime is critically important to ensuring
aircraft operations continue at airports. To become an aviation weather
observer, interested candidates must pass a background check and the
FAA Weather Observation Certification Test. The NWS previously managed
the program and provided aviation weather observation training to
assist those interested in obtaining an aviation weather observer
certification and prepare them to pass the certification test. However,
obtaining this certification has become much more difficult under FAA
as the agency places the burden on the candidate to find the necessary
observer certification training.
Enhance the State Block Grant Program

Authorize the FAA to provide funding to participating
Block Grant States to be used to administer the State Block Grant
Program (SBGP) to bring the administrative costs borne by the States
more in line with other modal programs of the U.S. Department of
Transportation. NASAO recommends an amount that is equal to an amount
that the FAA would have spent to perform the delegated responsibility
or three percent of the total funds administered by the Block Grant
States, whichever is higher.

NASAO also recommends that the FAA should provide SBGP
states with program administration training sufficient to carry out the
obligations of the SBGP at no cost to the SBGP states.
Improve the Timeliness of FAA Issuance AIP Grants

Direct the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to
review FAA's process for releasing/issuing grants and provide
recommendations on how FAA can improve its process to ensure timely
grant issuance. The FAA has had a history of issuing grants late in the
federal fiscal year due to a variety of factors. This poses a problem,
especially for the northern states, as the construction period is very
short. For instance, when bids open in June and FAA then issues the
grant in September, those construction projects may not start until the
following Spring, thus driving up construction costs even further.
Delays in FAA issuing grants has caused airport sponsors to have to
request that contractors provide a written extension to further hold/
lock in the bid prices past the usual 60 or 90 days. In today's
construction environment, bid holds exceeding 120 days are no longer
being granted by contractors, and airport sponsors are having to re-bid
projects or sign a local contract with the contractor at risk without
the grant from FAA to lock in bids. Contractors have stated that they
are including contingency in their bid prices if an airport sponsor
requests 120 days for a bid hold since materials costs fluctuate almost
daily.

Questions from Hon. Sam Graves to Mark Baker, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association

Question 1. In the 2018 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
Reauthorization bill, language was inserted to extend the duration of
aircraft registration certificates from three years to seven years. It
took the FAA four years to implement something as simple as a mandated
date change in the regulations.
This change is long overdue and certainly welcome given the
unacceptable backlog that has built up in the aircraft registry office
in recent years. As of the March 9, 2023, Subcommittee hearing, the
office was processing documents received the week before Thanksgiving
last year. Do you expect this date change to alleviate the backlog?
Additionally, what can Congress do to help the aircraft registration
office get back on track?
Answer. The extension from three to seven years will have a
positive effect on reducing the FAA's unacceptable backlog of
registration renewals and we appreciate Chairman Graves getting this
provision in the 2018 FAA Reauthorization bill. The FAA registry has
been reducing the number from a high of over 190 days in late 2022 to
148 days by the end of January 2023. As of the end of July 2023,
aircraft registration renewals were down to 41 days.
While the decline is good news and long overdue, AOPA continues to
help keep aircraft registration delay reduction a high FAA priority. We
are grateful to Chairman Graves for including two provisions in the
House passed FAA Reauthorization bill that will further improve
aircraft registration. Sec. 241 Aircraft Registration Validity During
Renewal will allow an aircraft to continue to be operated on or after
the registration's expiration date as long as the operator is awaiting
a pending registration renewal application and meets certain criteria.
AOPA also supports Section 248 Deadline to Eliminate Aircraft
Registration Backlog that sets a deadline for the FAA to eliminate the
aircraft registration backlog so that on average, applications are
processed not later than 10 business days after receipt.

Questions from Hon. Bruce Westerman to Mark Baker, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association

Question 1. As the committee formulates plans for the FAA
Reauthorization, we all want to ensure that our nation's airspace is
the safest in the world. The US airspace is extremely safe, of course,
but we can always do better. I'm especially concerned with the safety
of General Aviation (GA) pilots who are routinely flying to and from
small, regional, non-commercial airports. I'm concerned that the FAA
isn't taking strong enough steps to ensure safety of these pilots at
small airports.
For example, there's an airport in my district in Mena, Arkansas,
where pilots lose contact with the Memphis Air Route Traffic Control
Center when below 4,000 feet. Radio signals are blocked by mountains in
the area. Instead of fixing the problem by installing a Remote Center
Air/Ground site closer to Mena to ensure reliable radio contact, pilots
have been instructed to land without communication with controllers.
Once they get on the ground, they're supposed to check-in with Memphis
to close their flight plans. Of course, the airport manager in Mena
tells me that doesn't always happen, and he's been called after hours
at times to verify a safe landing. When he's out of town, the sheriff's
office has been known to take on this task.
I've read myriad news stories referencing a Boeing study showing
that takeoff and landing are statistically the most dangerous portions
of a flight. I realize that was a commercial aircraft study, but I'm
assuming there's a similar concern with GA aircraft during takeoff and
landing. As such, as a GA expert, can you tell me the following:
Question 1.a. What safety concerns do you have with the situation
I've outlined above?
Answer. The circumstance outlined above is not an abnormal
situation. Communication with ATC is not available at all airports
(including at Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport, which is an
uncontrolled airport) and is not required for the safe operation of
aircraft, including during arrivals and departures. While the presence
of a remote communications outlet (RCO) or Remote Communications Air/
Ground (RCAG) would be helpful, pilots are trained very early to
operate safely at uncontrolled airports.
It may, however, affect efficiency and convenience. When ATC is
aware of an arrival or departure at an airport, and cannot communicate
with that aircraft, they typically shift to a ``1 in, 1 out''
operation--in other words, no other arrivals/departures are permitted
until radio/radar contact has been established.
Flying in and out of airports surrounded by mountainous terrain
does require additional consideration and planning. Less experienced
pilots should use care, or even seek additional training, before
operating at these airports. However, these operations are common and
are not unsafe.
The takeoff and landing phases of flight are widely considered to
be the most critical phases of flight, both in commercial and private
operations. However, as noted above, communication with ATC is a
separate consideration--aircraft can conduct completely safe takeoffs
and landings while not communicating with ATC. In fact, the vast
majority of airports in the United States are uncontrolled airports,
where pilots are not in contact with ATC (although they do utilize a
common traffic advisory frequency to announce their position and
intentions to other nearby aircraft).

Question 1.b. Would your operation of an airplane be as safe
without continuous radio contact as it would be with that contact?
Answer. The answer to this depends on the type of operation being
conducted. Pilots are trained to operate an aircraft while not in
contact with ATC (as mentioned above). Flying an aircraft in or out of
an airport where ATC services are not available is in no way unsafe.
Rather, it is more a matter of convenience and efficiency.
That said, it can be argued that there is an additional layer of
safety when a pilot has the ability to communicate with ATC, whether in
the event of an emergency or just for additional situational awareness.

Question 1.c. In a bad weather situation with limited visibility,
would you be more comfortable as a GA pilot if you were in continuous
radio contact with controllers versus no contact below 4,000 feet?
Answer. Again, this would depend on the experience level of the
pilot and on the circumstances. Less experienced pilots would likely
welcome communication with ATC, giving them the ability to ask for
assistance if needed. More experienced pilots would feel perfectly
comfortable in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and out of
contact with ATC.
The specific circumstances might affect the comfort level as well.
For a single pilot flying a single-engine aircraft, in IMC, perhaps in
icing conditions, contact with ATC might be preferred. It might allow
for more timely updates of airport conditions or for guidance in the
event of an emergency.

Question 1.d. In many parts of rural America, cell phone signals
aren't 100% reliable. What would you do if you had no radio contact,
only spotty cell phone contact with the controllers, and it was after
hours at the airport? Would this affect your decision to fly into this
airport?
Answer. This question speaks to the importance of thorough pre-
flight planning. Pilots are trained to be prepared for the conditions
they are expected to encounter. Pilots know they need to close a flight
plan after arrival and need to be prepared to do so. If a pilot is
flying into an airport in a rural area, this might mean they need to
carry a satellite phone, or perhaps they need to call ahead and find
out where the nearest land line phone can be found.
The absence of a convenient means to contact ATC on the ground
might very well impact the decision about whether or not to make the
trip. To address the concern, the airport could provide an outdoor
courtesy landline for pilot use or encourage the cellular carriers to
improve their coverage in the area.

Question 1.e. What would you suggest the FAA do to fix this issue?
Question 1.f. If you have any other concerns or statements to make
on this issue, I welcome your expertise.
Answer to 1.e. & 1.f. Flying in general is an exercise in managed
risk. There is risk in every human endeavor and flying certainly
carries its share of them, but safety is always the top priority for
pilots. The key for pilots is to examine each flight and determine if
the risks are acceptable and to look for ways to mitigate or eliminate
any residual risks.
There may very well be a case for FAA to provide an RCO at the
airport in question. Doing so would certainly improve the convenience
for pilots and could, arguably, improve the level of safety. However,
it is important to stipulate that the lack of radio communication with
ATC, via an RCO, is not unsafe.
The cost of an RCO should also be considered--both the capital
expenditure to provide it and the ensuing annual operating expenses. If
the concern is primarily one of ensuring pilots can close flight plans
after arrival, it is likely to be more cost-effective for the airport
to provide an outdoor courtesy phone for use after hours.

Question from Hon. Hillary J. Scholten to Mark Baker, President and
Chief Executive Officer, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association

Question 1. Can you talk about the role smaller airfields, and more
broadly, general aviation, play for economic development for a
community, and how we can encourage further growth in the general
aviation space?
Answer. General aviation (GA) in America provides a significant
economic impact contributing $247 billion to the economy and supporting
more than 1.2 million jobs. Hundreds of thousands of GA pilots fly over
26 million flight hours, including more than 30 million take offs and
landings while also transporting hundreds of millions of passengers.
Through the network of more than 5,000 public-use airports across
the country, which is 10 times the amount served by commercial
airlines, as well as over 14,700 privately owned landing facilities
nationwide, GA is an integral part of the transportation system that
supports communities across the country.
General aviation airports play a vital role in our national
airspace system, and they are economic engines for local communities by
creating jobs, generating local revenue, and attracting businesses.
Thousands of small airports across the country, many of which are in
rural areas, are often the lifeline for businesses. In Michigan alone,
general aviation airports support over 33,000 jobs resulting in more
than $1.4 billion in labor income throughout the state.
General aviation and these small airports forge links between
thousands of businesses, their suppliers, and their customers and allow
those businesses to move people, equipment, and products with a degree
of speed and efficiency available through no other mode of
transportation. In fact, an estimated 65% of general aviation flights
are conducted for business and public services.
GA airports are currently eligible to receive up to $150,000 in
annual entitlements from the Airport Improvement Program's Non-Primary
Entitlement (NPE) program. Unfortunately, even with a four-year
rollover provision, these funds are not enough to meet costly safety
projects. Therefore, millions of dollars of unused NPE funds are
returned annually to the FAA discretionary account where they are spent
at airports across the country including at primary airports.
To help smaller airports, Congress should ensure that any NPE
carryover funds be spent exclusively on non-primary airport projects at
GA airports, which will allow these airports to better serve the
surrounding community and foster a welcoming environment for
businesses.
Also, aircraft storage is integral to the utility of any airport,
and 71% of airports across the country report a waiting list for
general aviation aircraft hangars. Congress should invest in local
airports by dedicating specific funding for new GA hangar development.
Airport managers have reported that hangars provide 45% of their gross
revenue, making them a critical source of financial self-sustainability
for any GA airport.
In addition, Congress should address the lack of transient
(visiting) parking for aircraft at federally funded public-use
airports. Today, airport access is limited for many GA pilots due to
the fact that pilots are being forced to park their aircraft at
commercial fixed based operators (FBOs) and, in many cases, pay
unreasonably high fees for services they never requested or needed.
Congress should require public-use airports to provide transient
parking areas for visiting GA aircraft and if airports choose to impose
a transient parking fee, it must be fair and reasonable. Congress
should also pass legislation that would expand security badging for
private pilots so they can escort themselves and their passengers off
secure areas at airports where TSA requirements are imposed.
Congress should also create a Public-Private Partnership Airport
Pilot Program that authorizes funds for marketing and education
programs to attract private sector investment at smaller airports.
Public-private partnerships can also go a long way to help local
communities that are cash-strapped to inject new life into their
airports and benefit the local taxpayers by increasing the airport's
economic output.

Question from Hon. Sam Graves to Jack J. Pelton, Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman of the Board, Experimental Aircraft Association

Question 1. Airmen in the past have been issued letters of
authorizations (LOAs) with the authorization for ``all makes and models
of single-engine and multiengine, piston-powered authorized aircraft,''
commonly known as an unlimited LOA. The Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) changed its policy in 2007 and no longer allows such an
authorization. Can you explain why it is important to the experimental
community for the FAA to bring back ``all makes and models''
authorizations?
Answer. Thank you, Chairman Graves, for your question and the
opportunity to provide a response.
The ``all makes and models'' Letter of Authorization (LOA) is
important for the experimental aircraft community, specifically for
those historic warbird aircraft with experimental airworthiness
certificates. This community is limited in size and scope by the rare
nature of the aircraft operated.
Currently, some experimental aircraft operating limitations require
that before acting as Pilot in Command (PIC), a pilot must receive an
aircraft authorization for each specific make and model on his or her
pilot certificate. The process is similar to seeking a type rating in a
type certificated aircraft. The rarity of aircraft and small size of
the community often leads to a lack of qualified and experienced
Experimental Aircraft Examiners and/or FAA Inspectors qualified in
specific aircraft who may issue the aircraft authorization.
EAA supports the FAA reinstating the ``all makes and models
authorization.'' Allowing skilled and knowledgeable pilots with
operational experience and authorizations in a significant variety of
other similar experimental aircraft to be issued the ``all makes and
models'' authorization can address the shortage of qualified examiners.
As a part of reinstating, EAA encourages that the FAA be directed
to work with industry to develop the suitable framework of such a
program. Engaging experienced and knowledgeable industry experts will
help ensure that the correct parameters are established with an eye
towards ensuring safety while implementing this enhanced form of PIC
qualifications in experimental aircraft. Industry is well positioned
with familiarity and understanding of these aircraft and can assist in
developing the appropriate qualifications and training as well as
suitable currency requirements to ensure safe operations by those that
hold these authorization.

Question from Hon. Hillary J. Scholten to Jack J. Pelton, Chief
Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Experimental Aircraft
Association

Question 1. Can you talk about the role smaller airfields, and more
broadly, general aviation, play for economic development for a
community, and how we can encourage further growth in the general
aviation space?
Answer. Thank you, Representative Scholten, for your question and
the opportunity to provide a response.
General aviation serves as the gateway to aviation and as an
economic generator for many small communities. Local airports, and the
general aviation aircraft and pilots they serve, provide a
transportation infrastructure and business network well suited to
supporting commercial and business development in surrounding
communities. Aircraft based at these general aviation airports, and the
airports themselves, support small and large businesses providing fast
and efficient access to customers, facilities and markets.
Local flight schools, maintenance facilities, and small aviation
businesses found at most general aviation airports serve as the
introduction to aviation for the vast majority of people. Additionally,
across the country these businesses train the vast majority of new
pilots and provide the training ground for large numbers of new
maintenance technicians and serve as an important, and often
overlooked, component of addressing the current and future shortage of
pilots and aviation professionals.
EAA feels that there are a number of actions that can be taken to
encourage growth and to promote general aviation.
Modernization of General Aviation and Flight Training Aircraft
EAA sees the FAA's Modernization of Special Airworthiness
Certificates (MOSAIC) rulemaking currently underway as an area of
critical importance to the future of general aviation. Small flight
schools around the country are most people's entry point to the world
of aviation. Many of these flight schools have found themselves priced
out of new, versatile training aircraft. A new generation of Light-
Sport Aircraft (LSA) could change that.
Current size and weight regulations limit the usefulness of LSA as
training aircraft for flight schools. Changing the limitations of LSAs
will allow for larger and more capable aircraft and permit a wider
range of students and instructors to fly them, significantly increasing
access to flight training. Additionally, this change should also
stimulate production of these aircraft by providing the needed market
to bring existing manufacturers of kit and amateur-built aircraft into
the LSA market and stimulate current manufacturers to increase
production.
The first MOSAIC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) is now
expected in summer of 2023. Congress should direct the FAA to publish,
by the end of calendar year 2024, a final rule that expands the
utilization of light-sport aircraft, promotes their use in flight
training and does so in a manner that ensures U.S. manufacturers are
not at a disadvantage to foreign manufacturers.
Protect and Grow General Aviation Airports
Supporting and growing general aviation airports through the
funding of additional infrastructure, promotion of compatible use of
surrounding land and protecting the availability of access to aviation
gasoline through 2030.
General Aviation Airport Funding
EAA supports the request of many of the general aviation
associations in encouraging Congress to increase the maximum funding
available to general aviation airports in the FAA's Airport Improvement
Program (AIP). AIP funding for general aviation airports has been
consistent at $150,000 and has not been increased for many years. An
increase in this amount would meet increased cost factors and serve as
an investment in the infrastructure needed to improve and expand the
economic and commercial engines of many small communities and their
associated businesses.
Education and Promotion of Compatible Land Use Surrounding Airports
Many challenges facing general aviation airports and stressors on
the relationships between these airports and their surrounding
communities stem from improper land use allowed near these airports.
Airports, once originally built far from residential communities, now
find themselves surrounded by residents, schools, and other noise
sensitive land uses. These situations could have been mitigated with
proper zoning promoting more compatible land uses such as agricultural,
industrial or commercial. These types of land uses are generally less
noise sensitive, many benefiting from groupings with similar uses. The
FAA should continue to educated airport sponsors to ensure proper
zoning and land use around airports to mitigate future concerns
resulting from incompatible land use.
Protect the Availability of Avgas at Airports through Transition to
Unleaded Fuel in 2030 or Sooner
EAA remains firm in our support of efforts to remove lead from
aviation gasoline and it is our position that any transition from
leaded to unleaded gasoline must be effectuated with safety as the
highest priority. The FAA, General Aviation Associations, and other
aviation stakeholders have launched a public-private initiative titled
``Eliminate Aviation Gasoline Lead Emissions,'' or ``EAGLE,'' which
intends to achieve its firm goal--elimination of lead emissions from
general aviation aircraft by the end of 2030, or sooner--through
development and deployment of a viable high-octane unleaded replacement
aviation gasoline that can be safely operated by the U.S. fleet with
minimum impact.
The continued use of leaded avgas through the transition period
will undoubtedly result in growing pressure on airports and operators
at the state and local levels. A patchwork of airport-specific
requirements leading to inconsistency in what fuels are available would
lead to airports that may or may not carry the necessary fuels, thus
creating a situation where aircraft cannot be adequately fueled or
could be misfueled, leading to safety, efficiency, and operational
concerns. Vital to a successful and stable transition is maintaining
the availability of 100LL avgas during the period of unleaded fuel
development, authorization for use, commercialization, and deployment.
The FAA plays a vital role in protecting the avgas supply throughout
this process, particularly on federally funded airports.
Congress should direct the FAA to ensure the safe and coherent
operation of the National Airspace System by protecting the continued
supply of aviation gasoline with the timely and expedient enforcement
of airport grant obligations. Airport owners or sponsors who accept
funds from FAA-administered airport financial assistance programs agree
to grant assurance obligations that require them to maintain and
operate their facilities in accordance with specified conditions.
Obligated airports who no longer provide reasonable access to 100LL
aviation gasoline should be found in non-compliance with their grant
obligations and appropriate action taken by the FAA.
National Center for the Advancement of Aviation
EAA strongly supports and encourages Congress to establish and fund
the National Center for the Advancement of Aviation (NCAA), originally
introduced in H.R. 3482. The NCAA is envisioned to be a national,
independent forum facilitating collaboration and cooperation between
all sectors of aviation and aerospace stakeholders and related partners
thus coordinating, promoting, and supporting the future of aviation.
The NCAA is proposed to focus on four key areas: aviation and aerospace
STEM curriculum; workforce development, economic and safety data and
research sharing, and being a forum for cross-disciplinary
collaboration. The NCAA would help promote an understanding of the
aviation industry, including general aviation, while ensuring that the
United States remains a global aviation and aerospace leader.
EAA's Efforts to Promote and Grow General Aviation
I would like to take this opportunity to discuss a few of the
initiatives and programs that EAA has developed and implemented that
encourages further growth in the General Aviation space. At EAA we feel
strongly that general aviation is best positioned to be an economic
engine for local communities when our industry is well understood and
when the relationships between our communities and their airports are
jointly beneficial.
EAA Chapters--General Aviation Engaging with their Communities
EAA has over 900 local chapters located throughout the country at
many of the nation's general aviation airports. The Chapter network is
the backbone of EAA and is responsible for more than 14,000 aviation
activities each year. Many of these events are social events, open to
the public and advertised within the local community. These include
open houses, breakfast socials, youth activities and educational
opportunities.
Young Eagles--30 Years of Introducing Young People to Aviation
Our Young Eagles program provides free introductory flights to
youth through a well-structured program utilizing our chapters and
members who volunteer to provide these flights. Acting on our mission
of growing participation, Young Eagles has to date provided nearly 2.3
million flight experiences. This number represents an entire generation
of young people who have been introduced to general aviation, many who
have then pursued careers as military or airline pilots, aerospace
engineers or a host of other aviation related professions. This program
has created a generation of people who have a deeper appreciation for
aviation and a better understanding of the value of their local airport
thanks to that free first flight.
AeroEducate--Inspiring Aviation Professionals of the Future
AeroEducate is a free resource filled with age-based activities and
clear pathways to aviation and aerospace industry careers where K-12
students can discover and ignite their curiosity in aviation. Being a
pilot is only one of many exciting careers in aviation. There are a
variety of career possibilities, from aeronautical engineering to air
traffic controlling to airplane maintenance to aviation management--and
a real path to that dream. Whether the interest is science, technology,
engineering, or math, or just a curiosity about how things work,
AeroEducate offers engaging aviation-based activities developed and
tested by some of the top minds in the country.

Questions from Hon. Hillary J. Scholten to Rick Crider, A.A.E.,
Executive Vice President of Airport/Railport and Military Relations,
Port San Antonio, on behalf of the American Association of Airport
Executives

Question 1. Can you talk about the role smaller airfields, and more
broadly, general aviation, play for economic development for a
community, and how we can encourage further growth in the general
aviation space?
Answer. There are more than 4,400 public-use general aviation (GA)
airports in the United States, providing communities across the country
access to the nation's air transportation system. The benefits of GA
airports to individuals, businesses, and communities as connection
points to the nation's air transportation system are significant. While
GA airports vary significantly in size, complexity, and configuration,
each provides unique functions and vital capabilities. In many cases,
GA airports are centers for industrial aerospace activities, training
hubs for the next generation of pilots, and access points to the NAS
for businesses in smaller and rural communities. Law enforcement,
firefighting, aerospace engineering and manufacturing, air cargo,
agriculture and recreation are other examples of activities that take
place at GA airports every day.
GA airports are also playing a key role with the development of
Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). Recent hearings before the Committee have
highlighted the immense promise that AAM offers to travelers, small
communities, and the environment. AAM has the potential to reduce the
need on aviation's reliance for fossil fuels, reduce commute times for
the traveling public, and promote both economic and workforce
development opportunities globally. The utilization of emerging
technologies such as electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL)
aircraft will help create new methods in transporting people, cargo,
and local emergency response teams between urban and rural areas. GA
airports can serve as incubators for these revolutionary technologies
and will undoubtedly play a key role as the industry evolves to include
the development and utilization of vehicles powered by batteries,
hydrogen fuel cells, and hybrid electric systems. GA airports have the
fundamental infrastructure in place to support ``Day 1 Operations'' and
generally have less concerns with airspace congestion compared to
commercial service airports.
The leaders and members of the Committee have long supported the
general aviation community and we are grateful that Committee leaders
have indicated a desire to include a GA title in the upcoming FAA
reauthorization bill. AAAE and its member airports of all sizes from
across the country look forward to working with the Committee as part
of the FAA reauthorization process to advance the priorities outlined
in my written testimony for the hearing. Specifically, we are seeking
increased funding for the Airport Improvement Program and more
flexibility to airports in how they are permitted to use AIP funds; an
adjustment to the AIP entitlement for nonprimary airports, including GA
airports; and continued support and funding for the Contract Tower
Program.

Question 2. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law which passed last
Congress is bringing billions of dollars to airports across the
country. Most of this will go to improving commercial services at
larger airports, but there is $500 million set aside annually for non-
primary airports. How can we use this funding to also strengthen
general aviation infrastructure?
Answer. As travel demand continues to rise at GA and commercial
service airports, there is a growing need for infrastructure
investment. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provided
airports with $20 billion over five years for infrastructure and
terminal grants, with $2.5 billion of that total specifically allotted
to and allocated among the thousands of nonprimary commercial service
and GA airports spread out across the country. We are grateful for that
investment.
While IIJA funding serves as an important down payment to help
bridge the enormous funding gap for airport infrastructure nationwide
and will help offset inflationary and cost escalation impacts, the need
for additional federal investment remains. According to the FAA's most
recent NPIAS, commercial service and GA airports have $62.4 billion in
AIP and IIJA-eligible projects--or around $12.5 billion annually--over
the next five years. Those totals do not include other non-eligible
infrastructure projects and requirements, which increase total airport
capital needs significantly.
According to the latest NPIAS, the capital needs for nonprimary and
GA airports are more than $19 billion over the next five years. And
that figure does not factor in rising inflation, increasing labor and
construction costs, or supply chain constraints. As members of the
House Aviation Subcommittee know, GA and smaller commercial service
airports disproportionately rely on AIP funding to meet their
infrastructure needs. The combination of stagnant authorization levels
for traditional AIP funding for the past two decades and rising
construction costs has greatly limited these airports from completing
critical safety and improvement projects. As Congress prepares for the
next FAA reauthorization bill, AAAE and ACI-NA are urging Congress to
increase traditional AIP funding to at least $4 billion and to continue
to authorize funds for supplemental discretionary grants to help GA and
commercial service airports meet their ongoing infrastructure needs.
In conjunction with increasing AIP funding, we recommend Congress
provide airports with more flexibility in how they are permitted to use
that funding consistent with provisions in IIJA and in recognition of
evolving airport infrastructure needs and existing limitations.
Additionally, we recommend adjusting the AIP entitlement for nonprimary
airports, including GA airports, since it has remained stagnant at
$150,000 for more than 20 years despite rising costs and infrastructure
needs. The current funding approach for nonprimary entitlements (NPE)
also fails to recognize the dramatic differences in aircraft activity,
operations, and economic impact within the wide spectrum of diverse GA
airports.
The NPIAS categorizes nonprimary airports based on their activity
level as either national, regional, local, or basic. Instead of the
current one-size-fits-all policy, Congress should modernize GA
entitlements by providing increased funding levels to airports with
more activity or that serve larger aircraft. Specifically, we propose a
tiered approach where the GA entitlement be set at $1 million for
national airports, $500,000 for regional airports, $250,000 for local
airports, and $150,000 for basic airports. It is important to note that
our recommendation for this proposed formula change is contingent upon
AIP funding of at least $4 billion annually.
The need for adjusting the $150,000 nonprimary entitlement is
evident at Kelly Field, where design is underway for a consolidated
facility that will promote eVTOL, along with other new and existing
aircraft. But the investment in infrastructure required far surpasses
the abilities of today's NPE formula. Notably, other GA airports are on
the forefront of efforts to develop, test, and build electric and
second-generation supersonic passenger aircraft.

Question from Hon. Hillary J. Scholten to Curt Castagna, President and
Chief Executive Officer, National Air Transportation Association

Question 1. Can you talk about the role smaller airfields, and more
broadly, general aviation, play for economic development for a
community, and how we can encourage further growth in the general
aviation space?
Answer. Approximately 4,500 general aviation (GA) airports provide
transportation options and support critical services for diverse
communities across the nation, including in many remote regions that
are not serviced by commercial airlines. These airports serve as
powerful economic drivers in their communities by offering arrival and
departure points for business developers and employing a well-paid,
skilled workforce. At the same time, GA airports support law
enforcement and emergency services; non-emergency medical and organ
transport; executive, recreational, and cargo transport; vocational and
aeronautical schools; powerline and pipeline patrol; and agricultural
and conservation efforts. GA airports also serve as the proving ground
for emerging technology, offering space to safely test and implement
the next generation of aircraft and aviation innovation. All told, GA
airports and the associated GA industry are responsible for 1.2 million
jobs and nearly $250 billion in economic output.
To help GA airports meet increasing demand and prepare for emerging
technologies, both federal investment and public/private partnerships
must be leveraged. Expanding the Contract Tower Program and increasing
the Airport Improvement Program's long-stagnant GA airport entitlement
are first steps toward that goal. Creating innovative public/private
grant opportunities will further allow aviation businesses to partner
with airport sponsors on the infrastructure needed to charge electric
aircraft, offer sustainable and unleaded fuels, install solar panel
projects, and more. The GA ecosystem is a valuable resource not only to
individual communities, but to our national economy and global aviation
leadership. Equipping GA airports to foster innovation, improve
sustainability, and meet the transportation and service needs of their
surrounding communities is a critical investment in our nation's
future.
