SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

TO:      LMembers, Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure
FROM:  LStaff, Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure
RE:      LFull Committee Hearing on ``Reviewing and
Examining the Francis Scott Key Bridge Federal Response''
_______________________________________________________________________

I. PURPOSE

The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will
meet on Wednesday, May 15, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. ET in 2167 of
the Rayburn House Office Building to receive testimony at a
hearing entitled, ``Reviewing and Examining the Francis Scott
Key Bridge Federal Response.'' The hearing will discuss the
ongoing investigation into the allision \1\ of the Motor Vessel
DALI (MV DALI or DALI) with the Francis Scott Key Bridge (Key
Bridge) and the Federal response to the incident. At the
hearing Members will receive testimony from the United States
Coast Guard (Coast Guard or USCG), the United States Army Corps
of Engineers (Corps or USACE), the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA), and the National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ An ``allision'' is a term of art defined as an event where a
vessel strikes a stationary object.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. BACKGROUND

THE FRANCIS SCOTT KEY BRIDGE INCIDENT

On March 26, 2024, the DALI, a Singapore-flagged cargo
vessel, allided with the Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland,
resulting in the collapse of center spans of the Key Bridge
into the Patapsco River and significant damage to the
vessel.\2\ Prior to the allision, the pilot aboard the vessel
issued a radio call that the DALI had lost power as it
approached the Key Bridge.\3\ In response, a Maryland
Transportation Authority (MDTA) police officer radioed two
police officers on either side of the Key Bridge, resulting in
the closure of all lanes with access to the Key Bridge and the
cessation of bridge traffic, saving countless lives.\4\
However, a construction crew consisting of eight individuals
were repairing potholes on the Key Bridge at the time of the
allision.\5\ Two of the workers were rescued from the water due
to the efforts of first responders.\6\ Unfortunately, six
individuals died in the collapse and as of May 7, 2024, the
bodies of all six victims have been recovered.\7\

A Unified Command and Joint Information Center was
established in Baltimore, Maryland, providing a coordinated
response and the distribution of information related to the Key
Bridge collapse.\8\ The Unified Command includes the Coast
Guard, the Corps, Maryland Department of the Environment, MDTA,
Maryland State Police, and Witt O'Brien's, on behalf of Synergy
Marine.\9\ Maryland Governor Wes Moore declared a State of
Emergency for the State of Maryland on March 26, 2024, allowing
Maryland to coordinate and request emergency resources and
support.\10\ President Biden visited the site on April 5, 2024,
and restated his intention for the Federal Government to cover
the entire cost of reconstructing the Key Bridge while
committing to the use of union labor and American steel.\11\
The President also signaled the Administration's commitment to
ensuring that the responsible party pays ``to repair the damage
and be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.''
\12\ On the same day, Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
Director Shalanda Young requested that Congress authorize a 100
percent Federal cost share to rebuild the Key Bridge.\13\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

HISTORY OF THE FRANCIS SCOTT KEY BRIDGE

The Key Bridge opened on March 23, 1977, and was the second
longest main span continuous truss bridge in the world at the
time, measuring 1,200 feet between adjacent towers and
supporting pillars.\14\ It remained the third longest
continuous truss bridge in the world at the time of
collapse.\15\ Constructed to relieve congestion in the area,
the Key Bridge provided a second crossing over the Baltimore
Harbor, especially for vehicles transporting hazardous
materials that are otherwise prohibited from traveling through
the Baltimore Harbor and McHenry tunnels.\16\ The Key Bridge
carried four toll lanes of Interstate 695 over the Patapsco
River, generating 12.4 million toll transactions totaling $56.1
million in revenue during Maryland's last fiscal year.\17\ An
estimated 30,000 vehicles crossed the bridge each day.\18\ As a
toll bridge on an Interstate that at the time of the incident
was not subject to Title 23, United States Code, the Key Bridge
had never received Federal-aid funding.\19\

THE DALI

The DALI, a then Marshall Island-flagged vessel, was
constructed in 2015 by Hyundai Heavy Industries in South Korea
and is owned by Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and managed by Synergy
Marine Group, both based in Singapore.\20\ The now Singapore-
flagged vessel was leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka and was
time-chartered to MAERSK, a Danish shipping firm, to carry
cargo under contract to MAERSK. Under time charters, the
charterer uses the vessel owner or operator's crew, meaning no
MAERSK employees were operating the 985-foot container ship.
The vessel includes 20 crew members from India and one from Sri
Lanka.\21\ The vessel has a 10,000 Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit
(TEU) capacity and was carrying 4,679 TEUs (roughly 2,340 40-
foot containers).\22\ The vessel is classed by Nippon Kaiji
Kyokai,\23\ was last inspected by the Coast Guard on September
13, 2023, at the Port of New York and New Jersey, and made nine
calls to United States ports over the last two years.\24\

The largest container vessel in 1977 when the Key Bridge
was completed was an SL7.\25\ SL7s were owned by Sea-Land,
operated by Sea-Land, and carried cargo under contract with
Sea-Land.\26\ They were built in Europe, but United States-
owned, -flagged, and crewed.\27\ SL7s were 24,471 gross tons
and had a beam of 105 feet.\28\ By comparison, the DALI, a
Neopanamax vessel, is 95,128 gross tons and has a beam of 157
feet.\29\

All vessels making call at United States ports are required
to maintain a vessel response plan and hold insurance for the
vessel. Following the allision, the Coast Guard activated the
DALI's vessel response plan, which brought contracted salvagers
at the vessel owner's expense to assist the response
operations.\30\

III. FEDERAL AGENCY RESPONSE

UNITED STATES COAST GUARD

Following the collapse of the Key Bridge, the Coast Guard
deployed numerous assets to begin search and rescue efforts and
to establish a security perimeter around the impacted area. The
Coast Guard Cutter Mako, an 87-foot Marine Protector-class
patrol boat, was deployed to serve as the On-Scene Coordinator,
responsible for coordinating the multiagency search and rescue
effort.\31\ As the situation progresses, the Coast Guard
continues to surge assets to assist with various elements of
the response. This includes multiple assets ranging from a 225-
foot buoy tender, 154-foot fast response cutters, 87-foot
patrol boats, and numerous smallboats, as well as more than 200
Coast Guard members including members from stations outside of
the immediate area to support the unified command.\32\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Following the allision, the Coast Guard issued an urgent
marine broadcast and set up a 2,000-yard safety zone for
surrounding waters.\33\ They continue to monitor and enforce
the safety zone. The Coast Guard deployed vessels and staff to
verify aids to navigation, finding one buoy off station and
relocated other aids to navigation to reroute vessel
traffic.\34\ The USCG National Strike Force, which provides
technical experts and specialized equipment, oversaw all
salvage dive operations, provided on site aerial assessment
with unmanned aerial systems, and supervised Salvage
Engineering Response Teams (SERT), which provided initial
assessments on stabilization of the bridge and the DALI. The
National Strike Force also worked to develop a salvage plan and
provided a phased removal approach involving the removal of 14
damaged containers carrying hazardous materials from the
vessel.\35\ The Unified Command determined that these damaged
containers largely contained soap and perfume products and
noted that no volatile organic compounds or flammable vapors
were observed.\36\ There were a total of 56 containers on the
DALI containing hazardous materials.\37\ The Marine Spill
Response Corporation deployed 1400 feet of boom around the
vessel and 41 bales of sorbent bill and has subcontracted
Miller Environmental in case of any unforeseen pollution
remediation needs.\38\ Most recently, 182 containers were
removed from the vessel to allow for salvage crews to remove
the portion of the Key Bridge lying on top of the DALI.\39\

While the NTSB is leading the investigation pursuant to a
Memorandum of Understanding between the NTSB and the Coast
Guard, on March 26, 2024, the Coast Guard convened a formal
Marine Board of Investigation to investigate and issue a report
on the allision.\40\ The Commandant may designate a Marine
Board of Investigation to promote safety of life and property
at sea or in the public interest.\41\ On April 15, 2024, the
Coast Guard's Marine Board of Investigation paused evidence
collection efforts to avoid interfering with an ongoing
criminal investigation being conducted by the United States
Attorney's Office for Maryland and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.\42\ Special agents from the Coast Guard
Investigative Service (CGIS) are assisting the Department of
Justice with the ongoing criminal investigation.\43\

The Coast Guard response is primarily funded through their
Operations and Support (O&S) budget. Under current statute, the
Coast Guard cannot recoup operating expenses unless there is
discharge or the substantial threat of discharge of oil and the
Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) is activated.\44\ When
the OSLTF is activated, the Coast Guard can recoup costs from
the Fund which is then replenished by the responsible party.
While the OSLTF has been activated, the amounts used from the
Fund have been for limited response actions to mitigate the
threat of a discharge of oil from the DALI.\45\ Once the DALI
is refloated and moved, the Coast Guard will cease use of the
OSLTF. Outside of the OSLTF, no other mechanism exists to
recoup costs occurred to their O&S account.\46\ While the Coast
Guard maintains enough funding to continue the response, the
incident has put a strain on the Coast Guard's overextended
budget and impacts their ability to perform other missions.\47\

UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS (CORPS)

The Corps is tasked with ensuring the navigability of the
Nation's waterways by providing for the safe and reliable
movement of commerce.\48\ The Corps is leading bridge debris
removal efforts within the Baltimore 50-foot navigation
channel. The Corps is working to reopen the permanent, 700-
foot-wide by 50-foot-deep Federal navigation channel by the end
of May 2024, restoring port access to normal capacity.\49\
Corps activities include use of dive safety experts, underwater
analysis and assessment with remotely operated vehicles and
sonar, use of certified bridge safety inspectors and urban
search and rescue structural technical specialists, and the
deployment of vessels for waterway debris management and
hydrographic and topographic surveying.\50\ The Corps has
employed contractors as part of its process for clearing the
damage and debris.\51\ The Corps has an ongoing relationship
with the Navy Supervisor of Salvage and Diving, who has
existing contracts with companies experienced in heavy salvage.
These companies repositioned two heavy salvage cranes from
Newark, New Jersey to Baltimore to begin the salvage work,
including the largest heavy salvage crane on the East Coast.
The existing contract allowed the debris removal work to begin
quickly after the incident.\52\

northeastern channel (Fort Carroll TAC) supporting up to 20
feet opened on April 19, 2024, and the southern channel
(Hawkins Point TAC) supporting up to 14 feet opened on April 2,
2024.\54\ These temporary alternate channels are located in the
portion of the Patapsco river outside the Federal channel. A
Limited Access Channel (LAC), partially located along the
northern alignment of the closed 50-foot Federal navigation
channel, opened on April 25, 2024, a week and a half ahead of
schedule.\55\ This 280 feet wide by 35 feet deep LAC will allow
approximately 40 percent of port capacity to return.\56\ The
Corps announced temporary closure of the LAC from April 30,
2024, through May 10, 2024, to allow for removal of a steel
truss from the Key Bridge laying across the DALI.\57\ These
efforts are necessary to complete before removing additional
containers from the DALI and floating the vessel to allow it to
be relocated before the planned channel reopening at the end of
May 2024.\58\

The Corps recently conveyed it has sufficient authorization
and available operation and maintenance (O&M) funding to
complete the debris removal work in response to the Key Bridge
collapse.\59\ However, the Corps is using fiscal year (FY) 2024
funds appropriated for operation and maintenance of the
Baltimore Harbor and Channels not initially intended to be used
for the salvage work, among other funds.\60\ While a formal
funding request has not yet been made, the Corps has indicated
an anticipated need for additional appropriations to replenish
diverted funding intended for other projects, including planned
maintenance of the Baltimore Harbor.\61\ This work is being
completed without a non-Federal cost share and therefore is
covered entirely by Federal funds.\62\

FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION (FHWA)

On March 28, 2024, FHWA received and approved an
application from the Maryland Department of Transportation for
$60 million in Emergency Relief (ER) funding.\63\ These ``quick
release'' funds are intended to help with initial emergency
response and repair costs and may be released prior to
completion of detailed damage inspections and cost
estimates.\64\ According to FHWA, the $60 million represents
approximately five percent of the preliminary estimated project
cost of $1.2 billion.\65\ The Maryland Transportation Authority
has reportedly said the rebuild will cost between $1.7 billion
and $1.9 billion, and the target for completion is fall
2028.\66\

ER is a special program within the Highway Trust Fund (HTF)
for the repair or reconstruction of Federal-aid highways and
roads on Federal lands which have suffered serious damage as a
result of natural disasters or catastrophic failures from an
external cause.\67\ Individual states are responsible for
requesting ER funds.\68\ Eligibility is dependent on a
presidential or gubernatorial disaster declaration.\69\
Maryland Governor Wes Moore declared a State of Emergency on
March 26, 2024, making repairs to the Francis Scott Key Bridge
eligible.\70\ States are required to submit an application for
ER funding to FHWA within two calendar years of the date of the
disaster.\71\ The application must include a comprehensive list
of all eligible project sites and repair costs.\72\

The ER program receives funding from a permanent annual
authorization of $100 million in contract authority from the
Highway Trust Fund (HTF) and periodic supplemental
appropriations from the General Fund.\73\ From FY 1990 to FY
2023, Congress provided nearly $23 billion in supplemental
appropriations from the General Fund and HTF for the ER program
in addition to the $100 million annual authorization from the
HTF.\74\ All supplemental appropriations have been derived from
the General Fund since FY 2005.\75\ The Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (P.L. 117-58) amended the period
from 180 to 270 days after a disaster during which the Federal
cost share would be provided at 100 percent for ``eligible
emergency repairs to minimize damage, protect facilities, or
restore essential traffic.'' \76\ After that, the Federal cost
share payable is 90 percent or 80 percent, depending on the
classification of the project.\77\

Despite being located on Interstate 695, the Key Bridge was
not part of the Interstate Highway System. While the bridge was
shielded as I-695, it was part of a larger segment that
comprises Maryland State Route 695, which includes sections not
on the Interstate Highway system, including the Key Bridge.\78\
According to FHWA, prior to its collapse, the facility never
received any Federal funding.\79\ The Key Bridge was
historically a toll facility, but because it did not receive
Federal funds, it was never required to comply with Federal
requirements, including tolling requirements. However, upon the
Maryland Department of Transportation's receipt of ER funding,
the facility was considered ``Federalized,'' and became subject
to all Title 23, United States Code, requirements going
forward.\80\

Generally, the Federal share for ER program-funded
permanent repairs is 90 percent for interstate highways and 80
percent for all other Federal-aid highways, unless a project
meets the conditions for an exception.\81\ In 2012, Congress
enacted changes to the ER program to allow that ``eligible
repairs to restore damaged facilities to predisaster condition
may amount to 90 percent of the cost of the repairs if the
eligible expenses incurred by the State due to natural
disasters or catastrophic failures in a Federal fiscal year
exceeds the annual apportionment of the State.'' \82\
Maryland's Federal-aid highway program apportionment for FY
2024 is approximately $828.3 million.\83\ If the costs of
repairing the bridge and other eligible activities, such as
emergency traffic services and debris removal, exceed
Maryland's FY 2024 highway apportionment, Maryland will be
eligible for a Federal share up to 90 percent for repair of the
Key Bridge.

Because ER is a reimbursable program the Federal Government
does not provide a state with lump sum payment, but rather a
state receives payment after making repairs and submitting
vouchers to FHWA for reimbursement of the Federal share.\86\
Once the state's eligibility for ER funds has been confirmed by
FHWA, Maryland can incur obligations knowing that FHWA will
reimburse the state. Prior to the collapse, the Key Bridge was
a toll facility.\87\ ER funds cannot be used to pay for lost

The NTSB is an independent Federal agency responsible for
investigating transportation accidents in the United States and
issuing safety recommendations.\98\ The NTSB is leading the
investigation into the contact of the DALI with the Key Bridge
and the subsequent collapse of the bridge.\99\ The NTSB's
general investigative process includes the initial notification
and decision to investigate, on-site fact gathering, analysis
of facts and determination of probable cause, acceptance of a
final report, and advocacy for the acceptance of safety
recommendations resulting from the investigation.\100\ The
NTSB's role while on scene of the Key Bridge collapse is
limited to the collection of the perishable evidence, including
the documentation and photographs of the scene and confiscation
of electronics and other components.\101\

IV. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS

Accepting ER funding has made the repair and replacement of
the Key Bridge, and the future operation of the facility,
subject to all Title 23, United States Code, requirements.
These include environmental review requirements, transportation
planning requirements, domestic content requirements for bridge
materials, prevailing wage requirements, Federal procurement
rules, and other requirements.\107\ In general, the Council on
Environmental Quality (CEQ), charged with overseeing the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementation,
maintains categorical exclusions (CEs) across Federal
agencies.\108\ CEs are allowed for actions that ``do not
individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the
human environment and for which, therefore, neither an
environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement
is normally required.'' \109\

There is a FHWA CE that could apply for actions following
an emergency declaration by a Governor of a state, including
for the ``repair, reconstruction, restoration, retrofitting, or
replacement of any road, highway, bridge, tunnel, or transit
facility.'' \110\ Specifically, the CE stipulates that this
work ``occurs within the existing right-of-way and in a manner
that substantially conforms to the preexisting design,
function, and location as the original (which may include
upgrades to meet existing codes and standards as well as
upgrades warranted to address conditions that have changed
since the original construction).'' \111\ For reconstruction to
qualify for this CE, reconstruction efforts must begin within
two years of the Governor of Maryland's emergency
declaration.\112\ Other Federal requirements to be met could
include Endangered Species Act Section 7 consultation and
compliance with the requirements of the Clean Water Act
associated with construction of the bridge.

LIABILITY

On April 1, 2024, the vessel's owner and operator filed for
exoneration from or limitation of liability, arguing that the
vessel owner's liability should be capped at $43.67 million,
which is the value of the vessel plus pending freight fees,
less repair and salvage costs.\113\ The petitioners filed in
Federal district court under the Limitation of Liability Act of
1851, which generally allows a shipowner to limit its total
liability to the diminished value of the vessel and pending
freight if the owner lacked privity or knowledge.\114\ In
response to the vessel owner's liability limitation action, the
City of Baltimore filed a lawsuit on April 22, 2024,
challenging the limitation assertion, claiming negligence on
the part of the vessel owner and crew, and seeking to lift the
liability cap.\115\

REVIEWING AND EXAMINING THE FRANCIS SCOTT KEY BRIDGE FEDERAL RESPONSE

----------

WEDNESDAY, MAY 15, 2024

House of Representatives,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:02 a.m. in room
2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Sam Graves (Chairman
of the committee) presiding.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. We will call the committee to
order.
I would ask unanimous consent that the chairman be
authorized to declare a recess at any time during today's
hearing.
And without objection, that is so ordered.
And as a reminder, if Members insert a document into the
record, please also email it to
[email protected]
.
At this point, I will just recognize myself for the
purposes of an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SAM GRAVES OF MISSOURI, CHAIRMAN,
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Graves of Missouri. So, we are here today to discuss
the initial Federal response to the March 26, 2024, early
morning incident involving the cargo vessel Dali and the
Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, which resulted
in the subsequent collapse of the bridge.
And I first want to acknowledge the six workers who, sadly,
perished that morning. And on behalf of the entire committee, I
want to express our condolences and offer our prayers to their
families and their loved ones.
I also want to express the committee's appreciation to the
harbor pilot and the Maryland Transportation Authority police
officers who saved countless lives by closing the Key Bridge
prior to the incident, and to all the first responders who are,
obviously, involved in that process.
And finally, I want to commend the Federal, State, and
local officials working that night to clear the wreckage and
debris and, obviously, continuing that effort, and to reopen
the shipping channel that supports the Port of Baltimore.
This committee continues to receive updates from the
Federal agencies who are responding and investigating the
incident, including those testifying here today.
So, hours after the collapse, President Biden announced his
intention for the Federal Government to pay for the entire cost
of reconstructing the Key Bridge, and the committee has
received a letter from the administration officially requesting
that Congress authorize a 100-percent Federal cost share to
rebuild the bridge, and I have personally spoken to Governor
Moore about the request on a couple of occasions.
On March 28, the State of Maryland applied for funding from
the Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief Program,
commonly called ER. Within hours of receiving the Maryland
Department of Transportation's application, the Federal Highway
Administration approved $60 million in quick release funding,
which it said represented roughly 5 percent or so of the
initial total project cost of $1.2 billion. This funding is
intended to assist with eligible repair work, which includes
emergency repairs needed to restore essential travel, to
minimize damage, or protect the remaining facilities, as well
as permanent repairs necessary to restore the highway to its
pre-disaster condition.
Under the ER Program, the Federal Government will reimburse
the State for qualifying work at 100 percent Federal cost for
the first 270 days. After that initial 270 days, States get
reimbursed at an 80- to 90-percent rate, depending on the
classification, and the program also provides flexibility to
allow for reimbursement up to 90 percent in some cases. So,
this past Friday, May 10, the Federal Highway Administration
informed the committee that they had designated the portion of
I-695 that includes the bridge as part of the interstate system
effective April 29, meaning that Maryland's reimbursement rate
is now going to be guaranteed up to 90 percent.
All that is to say that while the President's request has
been received and it is under consideration, Congress still has
roughly 6 months to act before any cost share changes might
occur. So, despite initial estimates of $1.2 billion to rebuild
the bridge, media reports now indicate that the State of
Maryland estimates that the bridge may cost somewhere between
$1.7 and $1.9 billion. So, it is important that we have a very
firm estimate before we take any further action on the cost
share.
In addition, if the company that owned and operated the
ship is found to be liable, we must make sure that the
Government actively works to recover any money that it is owed.
That could help offset the bridge funding or be used to make
the people and companies who obviously rely on and work at the
Baltimore Harbor whole.
So, several members of this committee have visited the site
with our Federal partners, and for those who wish to go up
there and see it for themselves, the committee will continue to
facilitate visits on a regular basis.
So, at this stage we need to make sure that we are not
getting ahead of the facts, and let the NTSB and other agencies
complete their investigations. But as we continue to learn
more, we will ensure that Members of Congress have all the
information that is available to them.
And I do want to thank all of our witnesses for being here
today, and I look forward to the testimony. I did talk to the
Governor just this morning about the hearing coming up, and he
is pretty optimistic about the litigation, too, moving forward.
I mentioned that just briefly in my opening statement, but it
sounded very interesting and very, very promising.
[Mr. Graves of Missouri's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Sam Graves, a Representative in Congress
from the State of Missouri, and Chairman, Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure
We are here today to discuss the initial federal response to the
March 26, 2024, early morning incident involving the cargo vessel Dali

This funding is intended to assist with eligible repair work, which
includes emergency repairs needed to restore essential travel, minimize
damage, or protect the remaining facilities, as well as permanent
repairs necessary to restore the highway to its pre-disaster condition.
Under the ER program, the federal government will reimburse the
state for qualifying work at 100 percent federal cost for the first 270
days. After the initial 270 days, states get reimbursed at 80 or 90
percent rate, depending on classification, and the program also
provides flexibility to allow for reimbursement of up to 90 percent in
some cases. This past Friday, May 10th, the Federal Highway
Administration informed the Committee that they had designated the
portion of I-695 that includes the bridge as part of the Interstate
System effective April 29th, meaning that Maryland's reimbursement rate
is now guaranteed to be at 90 percent.
All that is to say, while the President's request has been received
and is under consideration, Congress still has roughly six months to
act before any cost share changes would occur. Despite initial
estimates of $1.2 billion to rebuild the bridge, media reports now
indicate that the State of Maryland estimates that the bridge rebuild
may cost between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion.
It is important that we have a firmer estimate before we take any
further actions on the cost share. In addition, if the company that
owned and operated the ship is found to be liable, we must make sure
that the government actively works to recover any money it is owed.
That could help offset the bridge funding or be used to make the people
and companies who rely on and work at the Baltimore Harbor whole.
Several Members of this committee have visited the site with our
federal partners, and for those who wish to go up there and see it for
themselves, the Committee will continue to facilitate visits on a
regular basis.
At this stage, we need to make sure we are not getting ahead of the
facts, and let the NTSB and other agencies complete their
investigations. But as we continue to learn more, we will ensure that
Members of Congress have all available information.
I thank all four witnesses for being here today, and I look forward
to your testimonies.

Mr. Graves of Missouri. So, with that, I will turn to
Ranking Member Larsen for his statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair Graves, for
holding this hearing, and I want to thank each of the
administration officials for joining us to discuss the Francis
Scott Key Bridge recovery effort.
First, like the chair, I want to express my sympathies with
the families of the six transportation workers who lost their
lives while on the job, maintaining this important piece of
infrastructure. This incident is a reminder of why safety
always has to be the top priority in transportation: safety of
workers, the traveling public, and the residents of communities
adjacent to that infrastructure.
This emergency left in its wake an incredibly complex
debris removal challenge, a closed channel and a shuttered
port, significant regional economic and global shipping
ramifications, and the loss of a bridge essential to freight
movement and roadway mobility in the mid-Atlantic region.
Vice Admiral Gautier and General Graham, I want to commend
you and your team and your leadership and the tireless efforts
of the women and men under your command for their incredible
work to safely remove debris and return the channel to the
operations that currently exist under extremely challenging
circumstances.
The degree of difficulty became clear when I visited the
site of the collapse last month. I want to thank the Coast
Guard, the Corps, your State partners on the Unified Command,
especially the Maryland State Police, for guiding many Members
of Congress in our various trips to witness the damage. I look
forward to hearing the latest updates from you today on the
status of the cleanup and the estimated timeline for the full
reopening of the Channel and Port of Baltimore operations.
I am also eager to learn what resources and authorities the
Coast Guard and the Corps will need from Congress as the full
costs and impacts of the response become more concrete.
The Coast Guard has expended significant fiscal year 2024
operations and support funds to respond to this emergency, and
we are grateful the Coast Guard always does what it needs to
get the job done. Yet, it is unreasonable to expect the Service
to absorb these response costs, which were obviously not
budgeted for in advance, without impacting the Coast Guard's
ability to perform other missions. So, the Service must be made
whole.
Similarly, the Corps, in responding to the emergency, has
used fiscal year 2024 operations and maintenance funds
appropriated for the Baltimore Harbor and channels. If not
replenished, the diverted funding will impact planned
maintenance for the Baltimore Harbor once response is complete
and in future years.
These amounts were not, however, sufficient to fund the
response, and last week, the Corps announced the reprogramming
of $20 million in unused funds to continue the channel clearing
work. This level of reprogramming is unprecedented, and
demonstrates--in the absence of supplemental funds provided by
Congress for this cleanup--the budgetary juggling the Corps has
to do to get the bridge out of the water and off the vessel so
the Port of Baltimore can reopen. That juggling will continue.
I urge the Corps and the Coast Guard to communicate to
Congress early and often on what your needs are in this
process, on your plans to ensure this work can finish
uninterrupted, and to do so in partnership with the legislative
branch.
Beyond the immediate response, I look forward to hearing
from Federal Highway Administrator Bhatt about the timeline to
replace the bridge and the role the Federal Government is
playing in aiding that process.
Congress established the Emergency Relief Program in 1958,
as part of the Federal highway program, to provide for the
reconstruction of highways and bridges in the event of a
disaster. Congress understood that the State could not be
expected to cover the costs of an unforeseen emergency loss of
infrastructure out of its annual road budget.
That is still true today. Maryland transportation officials
estimate it will cost up to $1.9 billion to replace the bridge.
Frankly, there are a lot of estimates out there, and it is a
broad range, so, I really wouldn't call them estimates at this
point, frankly. So, while U.S. DOT has provided $60 million in
ER funds to date, we do know that is a fraction of the total
need.
Prior to the collapse, the Key Bridge carried 34,000
vehicles a day. Traffic diversion is increasing vehicle
crossings in the Fort McHenry and Harbor Tunnels by 18 percent,
and truckdrivers carrying hazardous materials currently must
add 25 miles to get through Baltimore via alternate routes,
including communities that did not expect hazmat trucks to be
going through them.
This committee has a role to help rebuild this critical
economic artery quickly and efficiently, including ensuring the
project can advance without a cost share from Maryland.
Finally, I want to welcome back Chair Homendy, and
congratulations on your reconfirmation last night. The NTSB's
thorough investigation of this catastrophe will help answer
questions about how to prevent future allisions, shore up
bridges, save lives, and protect our critical infrastructure. I
look forward to what Chair Homendy is able to share about this
incident based on the NTSB's preliminary findings, which were
released yesterday afternoon, I believe.
So, thank you to each of our witnesses, and I thank the
chair for calling this hearing today, and I look forward to
what you all have to say.
With that, I yield back.

TESTIMONY OF VICE ADMIRAL PETER GAUTIER, DEPUTY COMMANDANT FOR
OPERATIONS, U.S. COAST GUARD; MAJOR GENERAL WILLIAM H. GRAHAM,
DEPUTY CHIEF OF ENGINEERS, DEPUTY COMMANDING GENERAL, AND
DEPUTY COMMANDING GENERAL FOR CIVIL AND EMERGENCY OPERATIONS,
U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS; HON. SHAILEN BHATT,
ADMINISTRATOR, FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT
OF TRANSPORTATION; AND HON. JENNIFER HOMENDY, CHAIR, NATIONAL
TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD

TESTIMONY OF VICE ADMIRAL PETER GAUTIER, DEPUTY COMMANDANT FOR
OPERATIONS, U.S. COAST GUARD

Admiral Gautier. Thank you, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member
Larsen, distinguished members of the committee. Good morning.
Thank you, first off, for your kind words about the Coast
Guard in your opening remarks, and I appreciate the opportunity
to testify before the committee.
In the early hours of March 26, the containership Dali
struck and collapsed the Francis Scott Key Bridge. Six
individuals lost their lives. Baltimore lost a landmark part of
its skyline, and the region suffered a blockage of a crucial
waterway. We continue to honor the memory of those victims.
Today, at the 51-day point, over 6,000 tons of steel and
concrete have been removed from the wreckage field, access has
been restored to the Port of Baltimore, with more than 35 large
commercial vessels sailing through a limited access channel,
and 375 additional commercial and recreational vessels have
used 3 shallower, temporary access channels, the first of which
was established just 6 days after the bridge collapsed.
The hazardous materials aboard the motor vessel Dali were
stabilized, as was the ship itself, and I will report today
that Unified Command believes that the Dali will be able to be
refloated and removed from that site--early next week is what
they are looking at.
Particularly notable, countless complex steps in this
operation have been completed without a single worker injury.
These monumental efforts were made possible through the
exemplary unity of effort of the Unified Command, rapid
mobilization of personnel and resources, strong coordination,
and trusted partnerships. The Unified Command formed within the
first few hours, per the National Response Framework, our
national doctrine for response to disasters and emergencies.
The Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, Maryland State
Police, Maryland Transportation Authority, Maryland Department
of the Environment, and Witt O'Brien's, which represented the
owners and operators of the Dali, have effectively leveraged
each other's jurisdictions, authorities, and capabilities to
get us where we are today.
The Coast Guard is proud to be part of this response. Our
women and men serve on the front lines of a Nation whose
economic prosperity and national security are inexorably linked
to our maritime transportation system. We exercised 6 of our 11
statutory missions in this response from the early hours of the
search and rescue response to restoring vessel traffic by
setting aids to navigation.
The Coast Guard's broad authorities positioned the Service
to coordinate activities to assure the safety, security, and
stewardship of our waterways, but we are also successful
through partnerships and continuously exercising, operating,
and coordinating with Federal, State, and local industry
partners. One prime example, Chairman, you mentioned is the
fantastic work on the quick notification by the pilots to the
MTA dispatch, which inevitably saved countless numbers of
lives.
But the work is not done. The Unified Command remains
sharply focused on the full restoration of the MTS. Active
investigations continue in parallel with the response,
including the Coast Guard's Marine Board of Investigation, our
highest level of marine casualty investigation, to determine
the incident's causal factors and support the development of
preventative recommendations.
Our investigation is in cooperation with the NTSB, which
has taken the lead on the safety investigation. And the Coast
Guard investigation is also moving concurrently and separately
from the Department of Justice's criminal investigation.
While we look forward to the results of these
investigations, it is evident, looking more broadly, that the
size and complexity of ships has grown over the years, placing
greater demands on our marine transportation infrastructure
that may not have kept pace with the increased risks that these
vessels pose.
It is time for us to more broadly understand these risks,
so, as Deputy Commandant for Operations, I will be convening a
nationwide board of inquiry under title 46, U.S. Code, led by
my Assistant Commandant for Prevention Policy, Rear Admiral
Wayne Arguin. The purpose will be to assess the efficacy of the
Coast Guard suite of risk management tools, evaluate how
recently they have been used within major ports, and establish
a holistic, national level approach to develop risk profiles,
identify ways to address vulnerabilities, and propose actions
to reduce the risk of major incidents. This board of inquiry is
a necessary step to bolster our MTS resiliency and assure the
safe and secure and efficient flow of commerce on our
waterways. The Coast Guard is ready to lead this effort.
Thank you for this opportunity and for your enduring
support of the Coast Guard, and I look forward to your
questions.
[Admiral Gautier's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Vice Admiral Peter Gautier, Deputy Commandant for
Operations, U.S. Coast Guard
Good morning, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and
distinguished members of the committee. I am grateful for the
opportunity to testify before this committee regarding a unified
response to the Motor Vessel (M/V) DALI's allision with the Francis
Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland. First and foremost, I offer my
heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of the six
individuals who lost their lives. The Coast Guard has strong ties
throughout Maryland and the Baltimore community, and our sympathies are
with all those impacted by this horrible incident.
The Coast Guard serves on the front lines for a nation whose
economic prosperity and national security are inextricably linked to
the Marine Transportation System (MTS) and its maritime interests. The
Coast Guard assures the safety, security, and stewardship of the
nation's MTS, an integrated network that consists of 95,000 miles of
U.S. coastline, 25,000 miles of navigable channels, 50,000 aids to
navigation, 1,400 intermodal connections, and 361 ports. This
responsibility is paramount for the Service. The vast system of ports
and waterways that make up the MTS support $5.4 trillion of annual
economic activity and account for employment of more than 30 million
Americans. Your Coast Guard saves mariners in distress, enforces safety
regulations, inspects vessels, maintains aids to navigation, and
provides vessel traffic services to keep commerce flowing in a safe,
secure, and efficient MTS.
To safeguard the nation's uninterrupted access to domestic and
global supply chains from major MTS disruptions the Coast Guard
organizes and leads unified responses under the National Response
Framework (NRF). While the Coast Guard's broad authorities position the
Service to coordinate activities aimed at restoring the flow of
commerce, it is the strength of our partnerships that assures our
mission success. Continuously training, exercising, and coordinating
with federal, state, local, and industry partners are key Service
priorities and set the stage for successful operations, like the
complex and challenging response to the Francis Scott Key Bridge
collapse.
Initial Events and Coast Guard Response
On the morning of Tuesday, March 26, 2024, the M/V DALI, a
Singapore-flagged container ship, was transiting the Patapsco River
outbound from Seagirt Marine Terminal in Baltimore. At approximately
1:30 AM, the M/V DALI lost electrical power, propulsion, and steering,
resulting in the vessel striking the Francis Scott Key Bridge,
immediately collapsing three bridge span sections into the water. The
central bridge span collapsed across the main navigation channel,
blocking the channel to shipping and partially landing on the vessel's
bow.
Due to the rapid notification of the ship's loss of power by the
pilot onboard M/V DALI, the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA)
quickly halted automobile traffic on the bridge immediately before the
allision. Eight construction workers were on the bridge at the time;
one was able to run off the bridge, one was rescued from the water, and
the remainder were missing. Coast Guard Sector Maryland-National
Capital Region (NCR) immediately responded with search and rescue (SAR)
teams, which arrived on scene within minutes. Coast Guard SAR teams
searched alongside our state and local partners for the remaining
victims, using all available resources--including boats, cutters, and
helicopters. The Coast Guard suspended SAR operations after more than
18 hours of searching when it was apparent that no missing workers
survived the collapse, and operations transitioned to recovery of
remains. The six deceased construction workers were eventually
recovered from the wreckage during salvage operations.
While conducting SAR operations, the Coast Guard also closed the
Port of Baltimore waterway, established a safety zone, and coordinated
with the Federal Aviation Administration to implement area flight
restrictions to ensure the safety of the general public around the
wreck site. Responding agencies formed a UC and began a major operation
to stabilize the site and evaluate risks to public health and the
environment. The Coast Guard's proactive environmental response
included deployment of 3,250 feet of containment boom around the M/V
DALI.
As the initial response continued, Coast Guard surged deployable
specialized teams--including a Salvage Engineering Response Team,
Atlantic Strike Team, Incident Management Assistance Team, and a Public
Information Assistance Team--to lead and support efforts to ensure
vessel stability, incident site safety, and comprehensive damage
evaluation. The Coast Guard continues to apply its range of
capabilities, authorities, and resources to support the unified effort
surging more than 200 personnel to the UC since the incident.
Overview of Unified Command Responsibilities
The UC leading the response leverages federal and state agencies'
complementary jurisdictions, authorities and capabilities in a way that
achieves unity of effort towards accomplishing common objectives. The
UC is comprised of the Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE), Maryland State Police (MSP), MDTA, Maryland Department of the
Environment (MDE), and Witt O'Brien's, which represents the owner and
operating companies of the M/V DALI.
The UC was established in alignment with the NRF, National Incident
Management System (NIMS) Incident Command System (ICS), as well as the
National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP).
NIMS/ICS is utilized to provide a common method for developing and
implementing tactical plans to efficiently and effectively manage the
response to natural and man-made incidents.
The UC established a comprehensive response organization, and
aligned objectives and actions around operational priorities,
including:

Ensuring safety of the public and first responders;

Achieving accountability for missing persons;

Protecting the environment;

Safely restoring transportation infrastructure and
commerce; and

Supporting the investigations.

Additionally, the UC established a critical operational path to
achieve five milestones:

Milestone 1: Complete salvage assessment and engineering;

Milestone 2: Restore navigation;

Milestone 3: Remove the M/V DALI;

Milestone 4: Clear remaining wreckage; and

Milestone 5: Prevent and respond to pollution
(continuous)

Consistent with the President's direction to re-open the Port of
Baltimore as soon as possible, the UC worked aggressively towards
safely and efficiently restoring maritime commerce to and from the Port
of Baltimore to minimize economic and social impacts to the region and
nation. Continuous coordination and communication amongst UC members,
with elected leaders at the federal, state and local levels, and the
general public was essential to meeting the UC's objectives safely and
rapidly.
Leveraging its combination of authorities, assets, and response
capabilities, the Coast Guard is leading operations to stabilize and
refloat the M/V DALI while preventing threats to the environment under
its Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) authority and impacts to the
Port of Baltimore and MTS under its Captain of the Port (COTP)
authority. USACE is leading operations to remove bridge wreckage from
the federal channel by mobilizing resources, including the U.S. Navy
Supervisor of Salvage (SUPSALV), through its responsibility to maintain
federal channels for vessel navigation.
Partnership with State of Maryland leadership is vital to this
response. MDTA has primary jurisdiction over the bridge and is
overseeing bridge wreckage salvage and removal from the waterways
outside of the federal channel. MSP is the lead authority for victim
recovery and is working directly with victims' families. MDE continues
to provide oversight to prevent environmental threats in coordination
with the Coast Guard.
Accomplishments to Date
The UC made significant progress toward meeting objectives through
outstanding unity of effort, rapid mobilization of personnel and
resources, and strong coordination and communication. The dedication,
professionalism, and determination of responders resulted in major
objectives being met ahead of schedule and with no injuries to
personnel. Presently, more than 350 uniformed and civilian workers from
53 federal, state, and local agencies across the U.S. are deployed to
Baltimore to support ongoing recovery and salvage efforts. In addition,
553 contract specialists are actively involved in various roles related
to dive, crane, and vessel operations. More than 1,000 individuals
contributed to the Francis Scott Key Bridge response mission thus far.
To address the estimated 50,000 tons of wreckage at the Francis
Scott Key Bridge site, the UC assembled a substantial fleet of
specialized vessels and equipment, including four Coast Guard cutters,
more than 10 Coast Guard boats, 36 barges, 27 tugboats, 22 floating
cranes, 10 excavators, one dredger, and one skimmer. Progress in the
salvage effort is impressive, with thousands of tons of wreckage and
debris removed from the site for disposal or recycling and 183
containers removed from the bow of the M/V DALI.
Within the broader unified effort, the Coast Guard facilitated
significant progress in re-opening the Port of Baltimore and restoring
the MTS. The UC established three alternate channels with controlling
depths of 11-feet, 14-feet, and 20-feet. On April 25th, as a result of
the extraordinary efforts of the USACE, Navy SUPSALV, and their
contractors, a fourth limited access channel with a 48-foot controlling
depth was established, with the full opening of the channel to its pre-
incident specifications projected by the end of May. As of May 13th,
365 commercial vessels transited the four alternate channels, including
all of the vessels that were in port during the incident.
Coast Guard Investigation
Upon receiving notification of the major marine casualty on the
morning of March 26th, Coast Guard investigating officers from Sector
Maryland-NCR deployed to the incident and commenced a preliminary
investigation to secure vital evidence, including perishable data from
the M/V DALI's voyage data recorder (VDR). In accordance with existing
agreements, Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB) agreed to proceed with the NTSB serving as the Lead Federal
Agency for the concurrent safety investigations due to the multi-modal
nature of the incident \1\.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ NTSB was designated the lead Federal agency pursuant to the
``Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Transportation
Safety Board and the United States Coat Guard Regarding Investigations
and Related Matters,'' dated June 17, 2021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On March 26, 2024, I convened a Marine Board of Investigation
(MBI), the Coast Guard's highest level of marine casualty
investigation, to secure proper resources and assign our most
experienced investigators, marine inspectors, and engineers to this
critical task. MBI members deployed to the M/V DALI and assumed the
lead for the Coast Guard marine casualty investigation on the morning
of March 27th.
Under International Maritime Organization (IMO) protocols for
marine casualty investigations, the Coast Guard also invited foreign
flag administrations with interests in the incident to participate in
the investigations. As a result, investigators from Singapore (the flag
administration of the M/V DALI) and India (the flag administration for
the majority of M/V DALI's crew) deployed on-scene and participated in
fact-finding efforts. The MBI continues to evaluate evidence to
determine the incident's causal factors and support development of
immediate safety measures and preventative recommendations.
Port Recovery
In addition to immediate response and investigation activities, the
UC is leading efforts for port recovery and restoration of economic
activity in the region. In collaboration with interagency partners and
the maritime industry, the Coast Guard established a system for
assessing and mitigating long-term disruptions of the MTS. That system
was activated and is in action in the port of Baltimore.
Every Coast Guard COTP is required to maintain an all-hazards MTS
Recovery Plan. These plans set the foundation for safe, timely, and
efficient restoration of the MTS following a significant disruption.
While these plans are most frequently used following natural disasters,
they apply to any incident that disrupts the MTS, such as the Francis
Scott Key Bridge collapse. Included in the plan is a joint protocol to
determine potential national-level needs and priorities developed by
the Coast Guard and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Informed by
this protocol, the UC considers the following (in order) when
developing recovery priorities: national response and recovery
supplies; national defense materials; other national priority cargo;
local response and recovery supplies; local energy cargo; local
consumption food; and any other local priority cargoes. The protocol
does not make operational decisions or establish regional and local
priorities, which are being conducted by the UC.
The Marine Transportation System Recovery Unit (MTSRU) within the
UC coordinates port recovery efforts by engaging industry stakeholders,
identifying broader impacts, and recommending courses of action to
prioritize vessels and cargo activities. Several incident-specific
factors inform their recommendations, including vessel characteristics
such as cargo, draft, height, tonnage, maneuverability; waterway
restrictions such as draft restrictions, tides, air gaps for vertical
clearance, visibility, sea state concerns, tug and pilotage
requirements; and facility restrictions such as berth availability,
power availability, security, labor availability. For this response,
the UC used the MTS recovery process to enable the flow of limited
commercial traffic into and out of the port while also managing complex
salvage operations. Immediately following this incident, the shipping
industry independently identified alternative ports or transportation
modes to re-route traffic and sustain supply chains given the expected
long-term closure, limiting a need for commercial transits through the
port during salvage operations.
The UC's timely and transparent communications with the public and
community stakeholders was critical to recovery efforts. The UC
routinely broadcasts waterway status to the port community through
Marine Safety Information Bulletins, which provide information on
accessing USACE hydrographic survey data, controlling depths for the
various alternate channels, transit requirements for deep draft
vessels, and other restrictions and limitations such as weather.
As the salvage work progresses, UC continues to leverage the MTSRU
to engage with port stakeholders, share information on waterway status,
identify any emerging factors that could affect port recovery efforts,
and mitigate impacts wherever possible.
Conclusion
Through the UC, the Coast Guard is applying its full array of
authorities, capabilities, and resources to re-open the Port of
Baltimore safely and efficiently. Our ongoing collaboration with
international, federal, state, local, and industry partners is
essential to facilitating a timely recovery. We are grateful for the
tremendous contributions of responders and driven each day by the trust
and support of surrounding communities. While encouraged by progress
made to date, the Coast Guard remains focused on the work still needed
to restore the affected portions of the MTS.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to
your questions.

Mr. Graves of Missouri. Next, we have Major General Graham.
Thanks for being here. You are recognized for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF MAJOR GENERAL WILLIAM H. GRAHAM, DEPUTY CHIEF OF
ENGINEERS, DEPUTY COMMANDING GENERAL, AND DEPUTY COMMANDING
GENERAL FOR CIVIL AND EMERGENCY OPERATIONS, U.S. ARMY CORPS OF
ENGINEERS

General Graham. Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen,
distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the
opportunity to testify before you today to discuss the
emergency response by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to the
collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.
On behalf of the Corps, please allow me to begin today by
offering our heartfelt condolences to the families of the six
individuals lost to this tragedy. From the outset, we were
committed to supporting the efforts to recover their loved
ones. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with them.
Soon after this tragic event occurred, Maryland Governor
Wes Moore declared a state of emergency, and the Corps'
Baltimore district commander, Colonel Estee Pinchasin,
activated the district's emergency operations center. Our
state-of-the-art survey vessels, which usually serve to verify
the depth and width of the Federal channels, were deployed to
support the initial search and rescue dive operations. Our
support then evolved as the Army Corps joined a multi-agency
effort across all levels of Government to form a Unified
Command. I have been in a good many disaster responses over the
years, and this Unified Command team, led by Coast Guard
Captain David O'Connell, is one of the best I have ever seen.
The guidance from the President was clear from the
beginning: clearing the wreckage from the Federal channel was
the Army Corps' top priority. We needed three things to
immediately execute this mission: authority, current funding,
and the right contracting capacity.
Authority. We used the authority for the Baltimore Harbor
and Channels Project. Congress authorized the Army Corps to
construct and maintain a 50-foot-deep channel. That channel was
now fully blocked by the wreckage of the Key Bridge.
Funding. We initially used available fiscal year 2023 and
fiscal year 2024 funding for that Baltimore Harbor and channel
project. Additional funds, as discussed earlier by Ranking
Member Larsen, have been provided through internal emergency
reprogramming actions using aged, unused funding just from
Harbor Maintenance and Trust Fund projects. The Army Corps has
not used this emergency reprogramming authority at this scale
for over 15 years.
The third thing we needed was contracting capacity. The
Army Corps has a standard interagency agreement with the Navy
Supervisor of Salvage and Diving. Led by Captain Sal Suarez and
Director Paul Hankins, SUPSALV are true, world-class
professionals. They have a suite of contracting tools that give
us access to superb salvage companies. In this case, the
contractor they are using is Donjon Marine from Newark, New
Jersey.
The Army Corps turns to Navy SUPSALV often to leverage
their unique expertise. I last worked with SUPSALV in 2022
during Hurricane Ian response in central Florida. Navy SUPSALV
helped us pump the upper Kissimmee River backwards for a few
days, saving around 12,000 homes south of Orlando from
flooding. They are true professionals who know how to deliver
outstanding results.
With these three elements in place, we embarked on the
complex task of determining how to begin clearing the
approximately 50,000 tons of concrete, asphalt, and steel from
the Patapsco River. For context, that is over 200 Statues of
Liberty worth of material. After conducting extensive
engineering analysis, the Army Corps, in collaboration with our
partners, developed an ambitious but feasible timeline. Our
plan was to initially clear a 35-foot-deep, limited access
channel by the end of April, and restore the full 50-foot
Federal navigation channel by the end of May.
Certified by the Coast Guard, the limited access channel
was opened to one-way vehicle traffic on April 25, a week ahead
of schedule. This channel could support approximately 70
percent of the port traffic, particularly the car carriers that
are so important to Baltimore. To open up the full channel, we
first had to execute the most difficult task, that of removing
the section of bridge that had collapsed onto the bow of the
Dali. I am delighted to report that on Monday of this week, the
team successfully used precision demolitions to cut the bridge
away from the ship.
Today, operations continue to remove the Dali from the
southern edge of the Federal channel. This will facilitate the
removal of the remaining bridge wreckage from the river. We
remain on track to open the full 700-foot-wide by 50-foot-deep
Federal channel by the end of May.
In closing, we are tremendously proud to be part of this
stellar unified team who, as mentioned earlier, is safely
removing the bridge wreckage from the Federal channel, allowing
the Port of Baltimore to resume its role as a key supply chain
node and vital economic engine.
Thank you, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and
members of the committee, and I look forward to answering your
questions.
[General Graham's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Major General William H. Graham, Deputy Chief of
Engineers, Deputy Commanding General, and Deputy Commanding General for
Civil and Emergency Operations, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen and distinguished members of
the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify before you
today to discuss the ongoing challenging emergency response to the
collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland and,
specifically, the role of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) in
the recovery effort.
I am Major General Butch Graham, the Corps' Deputy Chief of
Engineers, Deputy Commanding General, and Deputy Commanding General for
Civil and Emergency Operations.
On behalf of the Corps, please allow me to begin today by offering
our heartfelt condolences for the families of the six individuals lost
to this tragedy. From the outset of this response, we were committed to
supporting the effort to recover their loved ones and our thoughts and
prayers are with them.
We also extend our sympathy to the people of Baltimore, the State
of Maryland, and the surrounding areas, particularly those whose
livelihoods depend on the vitality of the Port of Baltimore. Along with
our partners in the Unified Command, we are working tirelessly to
restore the uninterrupted flow of critical commerce in and out of
Baltimore, and we are incredibly proud of the progress that has been
made over the past six weeks.
The Incident
When the Singaporean-flagged container ship, the Motor Vessel Dali,
struck the Key Bridge in the early hours of March 26, we as a Nation
were confronted with many challenges. The Dali's collision destroyed a
supporting pier and caused a nearly one-mile-long span of the 1.6-mile
bridge to fall into the Patapsco River below, raining down
approximately 50,000 tons of concrete, asphalt, and steel. Two
construction workers survived and were injured, while another six
perished.
The bridge's collapse crippled Interstate 695, a major
transportation route used by an estimated 12 million motor vehicles
each year, and obstructed the Fort McHenry Federal Navigation Channel,
blocking access to the Port of Baltimore.
Soon after the incident, Maryland Governor Wes Moore declared a
State of Emergency, and the Corps' Baltimore District Commander,
Colonel Estee Pinchasin, activated the district's Emergency Operations
Center. The Corps team joined the multi-agency effort across all levels
of government to form a Unified Command and Incident Command Post to
begin the difficult task of determining how to begin clearing the
wreckage and restoring vessel transit through the federal navigation
channel.
Corps Authority
Congress authorized the Baltimore Harbor and Channels, Maryland and
Virginia project, and the Corps' operation and maintenance of the 700-
foot-wide and 50-foot-deep channel, in various Rivers and Harbors and
Water Resources Development Acts.
Additionally, the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899, as
amended, (33 USC 409, 411-415) authorizes the Secretary of the Army to
remove sunken vessels or similar obstructions/hazards from navigable
waters of the United States. Implementing regulations, 33 CFR Part 245,
allow the District Commander to fully restore the federal navigation
channel in emergency situations where an obstruction impedes or stops
navigation for safety and navigation.
Partnership
Utilizing our various authorities, the Baltimore District survey
teams sprang into action within hours of the incident. The debris
vessel, REYNOLDS, and survey vessel, CATLETT, were deployed to support
the Maryland Transportation Authority Police, the initial incident
commander in the first twenty-four hours of the response. These
vessels, along with Baltimore District structural engineers with urban
search and rescue experience, supported the search and rescue dive
operations. This support continued as the Unified Command was
established and the U.S. Coast Guard became the Federal On-Scene
Coordinator. By the end of the first day, the mission shifted from
search and rescue to recovery operations, and the Corps began clearing
floating debris from the channel. Survey crews from the Philadelphia
District provided supplemental support for this monumental effort.
For its part in the salvage effort, the Corps utilized an existing
interservice support agreement under the Economy Act to partner with
the United States Navy Supervisor of Salvage and Diving (SUPSALV). The
Baltimore District coordinated with SUPSALV for mobilization under this
interagency agreement, starting with $3 million from Baltimore Harbor
and Channels 50-foot Project Operations and Maintenance funds. This
cost-reimbursable agreement allowed SUPSALV to immediately execute a
delivery order to mobilize assets for this salvage mission. Donjon
Marine (Donjon) is SUPSALV's emergency salvage contractor for this
geographic area.
Operations
Partnering with the U.S. Navy has been crucial to ongoing
operations, offering both technical expertise and additional resources
with its salvage capabilities. This collaboration between the Army and
the Navy enabled a rapid emergency response, and I want to underscore
how quickly this mobilization occurred--SUPSALV coordinated with Donjon
to mobilize wreckage removal assets and support deep-water channel
remediation and restoration within hours of the bridge falling.
Donjon secured the Chesapeake-1000, one of the largest floating
cranes on the Eastern Seaboard, with a maximum lift capacity of 1,000
tons, which has proved to be an invaluable resource. To begin lifting
the debris, however, it was critical to understand how the wreckage
fell and what the conditions were like under the water. By partnering
with SUPSALV, we brought in commercial dive companies to survey and map
the underwater hazards and develop and safely execute the underwater
salvage plan.
I cannot overstate the danger these divers faced--the Patapsco
River is unforgiving, incredibly murky, and very cold. Salvage divers
could, at most, see a foot in front of them. These perilous natural
conditions were compounded by the jagged, twisted rubble of steel,
concrete, and exposed rebar, adding the risk of impalement and snagged
air supply hoses.
Through the courageous, methodical work of these divers and our
survey crews, we began to develop a clearer understanding of the
operational landscape. SUPSALV's initial salvage plan focused on
clearing the Fort McHenry Channel, but the overall salvage operation
has three lines of effort: (1) the Corps and SUPSALV's efforts, through
Donjon, to clear the federal navigation channel; (2) the Maryland
Transportation Authority's work, through its contractor, Skanska-
Corman-Mclean, to clear the areas outside of the channel; and (3) the
Dali's owner, Grace Ocean Private Limited, and operator, Synergy Group,
and their contractor, Resolve Marine's, efforts to clear cargo from the
vessel, enabling the unified team to ultimately clear remaining
wreckage from the vessel.
After the initial planning and scoping, the Unified Command
established three principal priorities to be accomplished concurrently:
(1) clear the federal navigation channel; (2) refloat and move the
vessel; and (3) clear the remaining wreckage from the entire waterway.
Clearing the Federal Channel
Dive and survey operations continued over the course of the first
week using highly sophisticated three-dimensional (3-D) sonar and LiDAR
imagery captured by the Navy's CODA Octopus 3-D imaging system, which
enabled us to map the wreckage field. We learned how challenging the
rigging and lifting process would be due to the tangled state of the
wreckage and that much of it was submerged below the mudline, in some
cases buried up to 30 feet deep. Additionally, the steel was under
tension and compression, presenting an engineering challenge and safety
hazard. As a result, the wreckage would need to be re-evaluated after
removing each piece.
Once the wreckage was mapped, the northern side of the channel,
opposite of the Dali, could be cleared to create a smaller, temporary
one-way channel. We planned for this ``Limited Access Channel'' to have
a width of 280 feet and a depth of 35 feet, which would allow for more
than half of the vessels trapped in the Port of Baltimore to depart.
Significant commercial and marine traffic could resume, bringing cargo
and commodities into the port even as the salvage effort continued.
After stabilizing the vessel, cutting and rigging wreckage, and
extensive engineering analyses, in collaboration with industry
partners, we developed an ambitious, but feasible, timeline to reopen
the navigation channel. We could clear the Limited Access Channel by
the end of April and restore the full federal navigation channel by the
end of May. The President announced this plan to the American people
during his April 5 site visit. With this timeline in mind, the Unified
Command pressed forward, paying careful attention to site safety and
environmental concerns while prioritizing victim recovery.
Within the federal channel, we identified five principal sections
of truss, the steel supporting structure of the Key Bridge, numbered
zero (on the northern side) to four (on the southern side and laying
atop the Dali). To open the Limited Access Channel, we had to remove
truss sections zero and one.
On April 6, we began with diving, rigging, and cutting, and by
April 14, the Chesapeake-1000 lifted the 440-ton piece of truss section
one. Two days later, salvors lifted the second half of section one.
Section zero, weighing nearly 1,000 tons, was lifted in three pieces as
teams removed the final piece late into the night of April 22.
Additionally, prior to these lifts the Corps' Engineer Research and
Development Center worked with the Association of Maryland Pilots to
develop and test simulations that projected the viability of the
Limited Access Channel.
The Corps was able to clear the Limited Access Channel a week early
and above scope at 300 feet in width by 38 feet deep. After the U.S.
Coast Guard's assessments, the Limited Access Channel was open to one-
way vessel traffic on April 25, capable of supporting approximately 80
percent of the types of vessels that the port served prior to the
collapse.
Refloating and Moving the Motor Vessel Dali
Concurrently, while salvage operations were taking place in and
around the federal channel, work had begun to refloat and move the
Dali. This involved removing about four percent of the nearly 4,700
containers on the ship, along with removing obstructions from the bow
of the ship. To remove the largest section of truss from the Dali, the
Unified Command approved a controlled demolition technique involving
precision cutting using small charges to break the section safely and
efficiently into more manageable, liftable pieces. As of the date of
this testimony, the Corps is on track to complete the removal of
section four by mid-May and to restore two-way traffic to the federal
channel by the end of May 2024.
Clearing the Remaining Wreckage (Federal Channel and Adjacent Areas)
Currently, work continues to remove all remaining wreckage across
the full federal channel. On April 20, a 200-ton wreck grab claw
arrived onsite that, when rigged to the Chesapeake-1000, removes
greater amounts of wreckage from the riverbed, increasing efficiency.
All recovered wreckage is moved via barge from the incident site to a
location approximately two miles to the east known as Sparrows Point.
Skanska-Corman-Mclean, Maryland's contractor, leased ten acres of
property on Sparrows Point to establish a wreckage processing operation
there.
Once wreckage is deposited, Maryland assumes ownership, and its
contractor is responsible for breakdown, processing, and recycling
disposal. Much of the wreckage, specifically within the federal
channel, is buried deep in the mud, and the lifts of the wreckage are
mixed with mud and smaller pieces of steel, concrete, and asphalt.
Donjon has been handling this mixed wreckage for offload and further
separation and processing.
Outside of the federal channel, temporary alternate channels at
Sollers and Hawkins Points, to the north and south of the federal
channel respectively, were opened by the Coast Guard on April 1.
Shallow-draft vessels and other smaller craft, in coordination with the
U.S. Coast Guard, have been transiting these channels since that time.
A third temporary alternate channel, Fort Carroll, with a 20-foot
depth, was similarly opened by the Coast Guard on April 18 and remains
in operation. The Maryland Transportation Authority's efforts to clear
wreckage from outside the federal channel continue as of the date of
this testimony.
Salvage Operations Funding
Acknowledging the emergency nature of this disaster and the
critical need to reopen the federal channel quickly, the Corps used the
Fiscal Year 2024 funds appropriated to support the operation and
maintenance of the Baltimore Harbor and Channels 50-foot project to
initiate the salvage efforts.
The Corps obtained additional funds through an internal emergency
reprogramming of unused Operation and Maintenance funds from prior year
appropriations to continue to support this mission utilizing prior-
year. We are taking great care to ensure these reprogramming efforts
will not negatively impact other Corps projects. So far, the Corps has
obligated approximately $37M on wreckage removal and emergency
response.
Closing
In closing, I'd like to thank the Committee for having me here
today. I'm incredibly proud of our Corps team members, our partners in
the Unified Command (U.S. Coast Guard, Maryland Department of the
Environment, Maryland Transportation Authority, Maryland State Police),
as well as all other associated agencies and industry partners, and for
having zero safety incidents on any of the salvors thus far.
From day one, this entire mission was about a commitment to get the
job done right and safely, deliver for the people of Baltimore and the
Nation, and honor the families whose loved ones were taken from them. I
believe we have continued to deliver on that promise, and I will be
forever proud of the work we have accomplished together. This challenge
is immense, but with a unified effort, it is not insurmountable.
Thank you again for the opportunity to be here today, and I look
forward to your questions.

Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you.
Next, Administrator Bhatt, you are recognized for 5
minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. SHAILEN BHATT, ADMINISTRATOR, FEDERAL HIGHWAY
ADMINISTRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member
Larsen, and members of the committee, thank you for the
opportunity to appear before you today.
The collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26
was a tragic event for Baltimore, Maryland, and the entire
Nation. While the collapse of the bridge itself was shocking,
we must not lose sight of the devastating impact this tragedy
has had on the victims and their families. The six victims were
fathers, husbands, and friends in their homes and communities,
and they were valued members of the construction workforce. We
will always mourn these six individuals who lost their lives
while working to strengthen our transportation system.
I also want to thank the emergency responders who acted
quickly to save lives.
I have had the opportunity to visit the site of the bridge
collapse, and while I have been engaged in a number of bridge-
related incidents during my career, I have never seen anything
at this scale. It is a monumental task to clean up the site and
rebuild. And yet, as I appear before the committee today, I
have a great feeling of optimism, witnessing the ability of
industry and Government entities to work together in times of
calamity, as they have done in the weeks since the bridge
collapse. Immediately following this catastrophic event, the
Federal Highway Administration mobilized internally across
multiple offices and externally with local, State, and Federal
partners to support the response.
President Biden has been clear in this administration's
commitment to reconstruct the bridge. Under Secretary
Buttigieg's leadership, FHWA is actively coordinating with
other operating administrations and offices within the United
States Department of Transportation, the Maryland Department of
Transportation, which includes the Maryland Transportation
Authority and State Highway Administration, the city of
Baltimore, U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
and others to mitigate supply chain impacts, manage traffic,
reopen the port, and ultimately reconstruct the bridge.
FHWA is actively supporting the National Transportation
Safety Board's investigation of the collapse. FHWA has been in
direct communication with MDOT, Maryland DOT, regarding all
possible options for reconstructing the bridge, and is
committed to supporting these efforts so that the bridge can be
reconstructed as quickly and safely as possible. It is critical
that we reconstruct this vital connection for people and goods
traveling along the east coast. Ensuring that the I-695
corridor is open, operational, and safe for the traveling
public at the earliest possible moment is a top priority.
On March 28, within hours of receiving the request for
funding assistance from Maryland DOT, FHWA announced the
immediate availability of $60 million in quick release
emergency relief funds. These funds serve as a downpayment
towards initial costs, and additional Emergency Relief Program
funding will be made available as work continues. The
administration is asking Congress to join it in demonstrating a
commitment to aid in recovery efforts by authorizing a 100-
percent Federal cost share for rebuilding the bridge,
consistent with past catastrophic bridge collapses.
FHWA continues to provide wide-ranging technical assistance
to Maryland DOT regarding contract procurement for debris
removal, procurement for reconstruction operations, and project
delivery strategies to reconstruct the bridge quickly and
safely.
FHWA also is working with Maryland DOT to ensure that the
new bridge will be built to current design standards and in
accordance with all applicable Federal laws.
On March 26, 2024, the day of the collapse, FHWA met with
the national transportation liaisons from the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and the EPA to
discuss each agency's respective emergency procedures and
considerations to expedite the environmental review and
permitting processes for the future reconstruction. FHWA
continues to meet with Federal resource agencies to discuss
permitting.
Thank you to the State, local, and Federal entities who
continue to collaborate in response to this tragic event.
Whether it is an event of this scale and complexity, or the
comparatively smaller but still impactful bridge incidents on
I-95 in Philadelphia and on I-10 in Los Angeles, I am proud to
lead an agency that is playing a part in showing the country
what can happen when the Government and industry come together
with a common goal. There are no Democratic roads or Republican
bridges. Transportation truly unites us. FHWA will continue to
do everything it can to support the response. As the President
has said, we will not rest until the cement has dried on the
entirety of a new bridge.
Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you
today. I would be happy to answer any questions.

Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thanks. Now we will go to Chair
Homendy.

TESTIMONY OF HON. JENNIFER HOMENDY, CHAIR, NATIONAL
TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD

Ms. Homendy. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Graves,
Ranking Member Larsen, and members of the committee.
With me today is our lead investigator on this accident,
Marcel Muise, our acting director of marine safety, Eric
Stolzenberg, and other dedicated NTSB staff. Thank you for the
opportunity to be here today to discuss our ongoing
investigation into the collapse of the Francis Scott Key
Bridge.
On behalf of the NTSB, I offer our heartfelt condolences to
the families of all those who were lost in this tragedy, and
our deepest sympathies to those who were injured or otherwise
impacted by this event.
I also want to thank our numerous Federal and State
partners for their support on-scene and throughout this
investigation.
Yesterday, we released our preliminary report which shows
that the Dali experienced four total power outages. Preliminary
information indicates that the March 25 blackouts were
mechanically distinct from those that occurred on March 26. Two
were related to routine maintenance in port. Two were
unexpected tripping of circuitbreakers on the accident voyage.
On the 25th, a blackout occurred when a crewmember
mistakenly closed an engine damper while he was working on the
exhaust system in port. This effectively blocked the engine's
exhaust gases from traveling out of the vessel's stack, causing
the engine to stall. Vessel power was briefly restored, but
insufficient fuel pressure to the online generator caused its
speed to decrease. Its breaker opened, and a second blackout
occurred.
While recovering from this second blackout, the crew
switched to a different transformer and set of breakers from
those that had been in use for several months. Switching
breakers is not unusual, but may have affected operations the
very next day on the accident voyage. So, the configuration of
the breakers remains under investigation.
On the 26th, when the ship was about 0.6 miles from the
bridge, one high-voltage and one low-voltage breaker that were
powering most of the vessel's equipment and lighting
unexpectedly tripped. As a result, the vessel lost main
propulsion. Bridge equipment also lost power, and the voyage
data recorder lost system feeds. Bridge audio continued to be
recorded.
The crew was able to briefly restore power to the vessel,
but another blackout occurred when a different breaker tripped.
At this point, the ship was about 0.2 miles from the Key
Bridge. The crew regained electrical power right before the
Dali struck pier 17, but they were unable to restore
propulsion.
The ship had an emergency generator, which automatically
started following the first blackout on the 26th. However, the
generator only powers systems like emergency lighting,
navigation, radio equipment, alarms, and a steering pump that
allowed for low-speed limited rudder movements. It does not
power propulsion, and without the propeller turning, the rudder
was less effective. They were essentially drifting.
We are still investigating the exact time the emergency
generator started. Going forward, this is a complex
investigation. Our investigators have been on-scene
consistently since this accident. In fact, they are on board
the vessel as I testify today. It is unprecedented to be there
that long. We will continue evaluating the design and operation
of the Dali's power distribution system, including its
breakers. Examination of damage to the vessel will continue
when the ship is clear of debris and moved to a shoreside
facility.
We are also working with Maryland as they assess pier
protection on their other bridges, and we are examining pier
protection improvements that have been made following other
bridge collapses resulting from marine vessel strikes that we
have investigated in the past.
Lastly, there are a lot of questions regarding the fuel.
Our investigators found that the ship was running on low-
sulphur marine gas oil at the time of the accident, which it
had been using since March 21. We directed an independent lab
to test all fuels stored on the ship, including the fuel that
was being burned at the time of the accident. The test results
did not identify any concerns related to the quality of the
fuel.
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I look
forward to answering your questions.
[Ms. Homendy's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Jennifer Homendy, Chair, National
Transportation Safety Board
Good morning, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and members
of the committee. As chair of the National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB), I thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to
discuss the NTSB's ongoing investigation into the cargo vessel Dali's
striking of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge and subsequent bridge
collapse. We offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and
communities of all those who were lost in this tragedy, and our
assurance that this investigation will be thorough and impartial.
The NTSB is an independent federal agency charged by Congress with
investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and
significant events in the other modes of transportation: railroad,
transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We determine
the probable causes of the accidents and events we investigate, and
issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future occurrences. In
addition, we conduct transportation safety research studies and offer
information and other assistance to family members and survivors for
each accident or event we investigate. We also serve as the appellate
authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and mariner
certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and US
Coast Guard, respectively, and we adjudicate appeals of civil penalty
actions taken by the FAA.
Our current investigative workload includes over 1,200 active
investigations in 47 states and Puerto Rico, in addition to supporting
more than 140 foreign investigations in over 50 countries. Throughout a
typical year, we work on about 2,200 domestic and 450 foreign cases,
and we expect the number of cases annually to remain high and continue
to increase in complexity. Our activities include multiple major
investigations, such as the in-flight structural failure of a Boeing
737-9 MAX over Portland, Oregon; the derailment of a Norfolk Southern
train in East Palestine, Ohio; multiple runway incursions and other
near-miss incidents at airports across the country; and, of course, the
tragic collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge after it was
struck by the cargo vessel Dali, the subject of today's hearing.
Some investigations, understandably, get more public attention than
others, but all the NTSB's investigations are critical for improving
transportation safety. We owe it to the families of those involved, to
the communities where events occurred, and to the traveling public to
find out what happened, why it happened, and to make recommendations to
help ensure it never happens again. That's exactly what we intend to do
in the case of this Baltimore bridge collapse.
Because our investigation into the bridge collapse is ongoing,
there are limits to what I can say publicly at this time. As I am sure
you can appreciate, I will not undermine the meticulous work of our
investigators by speculating prematurely about our eventual analysis
and findings. What I will share is information about the facts we have
gathered thus far in our investigation, our fact-gathering process, the
challenges to date, and the expected direction of our investigation
based on what we know today. I will also outline how our agency's needs
relate to this investigation.
A comprehensive summary of the facts we have gathered thus far is
available in our preliminary report on this investigation, which was
released on May 14 and is available to the public at NTSB.gov.\1\ I
want to stress that these findings are preliminary and, as in any
investigation, may be subject to change at a later date as new
information comes to light.

\1\ Marine Investigation Preliminary Report, Contact of Cargo
Vessel Dali with Francis Scott Key Bridge and Subsequent Bridge
Collapse [https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA24MM031.aspx].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NTSB investigators were on scene in Baltimore and onboard the Dali
until May 10, just last week--nearly 7 weeks after the accident. It is
highly unusual for an NTSB investigation that our on-scene fact-
gathering remained underway for so long. This unusual occurrence speaks
to the immense complexity of this event and, therefore, the immense
complexity of the investigation. That said, you can be sure the NTSB
and our expert employees are fully prepared to complete a comprehensive
investigation on behalf of the American people into the causes of this
tragedy, and we will do exactly that.
Our comprehensive investigation is a multimodal effort, drawing on
the expertise of our Office of Marine Safety, which is leading the
investigation, as well as our offices of Highway Safety, Research and
Engineering, and Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials
Investigations.
Since the inception of the agency in 1967, the NTSB has completed
more than 2,000 marine investigations. Of those, 311 were major
investigations resulting in safety recommendations. In addition, 30
safety studies, other modal investigations, and other Board projects
have generated marine safety recommendations over the years. In total,
we have issued 2,636 marine safety recommendations to date, including
67 recommendations related to bridge collapses due to vessel strikes.
All 67 of these recommendations are attached for the record.
Our marine safety investigators boast over a combined 400 years of
professional expertise in their field, in addition to the decades of
combined experience possessed by our highway and bridge, data recorder,
and hazardous materials investigators. This investigation is in good
hands with their knowledge.
That said, it is also true that the NTSB badly needs additional
resources to ensure a major investigation like this does not impede our
ability to respond to additional accidents and complete simultaneous
investigations in a timely manner. The Dali investigation provides a
telling example.
Our Office of Marine Safety currently has 12 investigators. Half of
those investigators were deployed to Baltimore and their time will be
consumed by this investigation for months to come. In the meantime,
that office is also currently investigating 60 other marine safety
events and will undoubtedly be called to the scene of additional marine
casualties in the months ahead. The other NTSB offices involved in this
investigation--whether as investigators or as staff supporting their
efforts--must maintain a similar balance.
The NTSB is deeply grateful to Congress for the additional
resources provided in our fiscal year 2024 (FY24) appropriations. We
know that was a heavy lift at a time when very few agencies received an
increase. I am also extremely grateful to this committee for its
leadership in including the NTSB in the FAA reauthorization, which
authorizes funding increases over the next 5 years that will help us
keep pace with growing costs. I must note, however, that more resources
are still needed to ensure timely completion of all our investigations.
The NTSB received a $10.7 million increase in our FY24
appropriations. However, given the $5.175 million cost of mandatory
payroll and benefits increases, and the $1.575 million that will be
required for inflationary operational increases, much of that
appropriations increase is already accounted for. Subtracting those
built-in costs leaves an increase of $4 million over FY23. We intend
for this increase to take us from 435 staff on board today up to 450 by
the end of FY24, but 4 of those positions will be filled by staff for
two new Board members. Operationally, that would equate to an increase
of only 11 positions spread across all our departments, a fraction of
the need.
The fact is, we need to add over 50 more investigators today to be
fully staffed. Our Office of Marine Safety alone needs an additional 5
positions--and that's without growing the number of Marine safety
investigators. These positions include our Director of Marine Safety,
who passed away suddenly in March; one senior investigator to fill a
vacancy; a Naval architect; a program manager; and a mission support
specialist.
In addition, we need 16 more aviation investigators, 10 more
highway investigators, 10 more pipeline and hazardous materials
investigators, and 5 more rail investigators. In our research and
engineering laboratories, we need 12 additional employees and $2.4
million dollars to replace aging and obsolete equipment that is
critical to conducting robust and comprehensive investigations. And
these increases do not even begin to address staffing needs in our
support offices, who also play a vital role in achieving our mission.
The NTSB is a small agency relative to our federal partners, both
in terms of the size of our budget and our workforce. However, as our
recommendation implementation success rate shows, our impact is
profound. Everyone at the NTSB plays a role in achieving our mission to
make transportation safer. The amounts in our reauthorization and
budget requests represent only a modest downpayment on the investments
we need to boost transportation safety across all transportation modes
nationwide.
When I say that we need more resources, I want to be clear about
exactly what we are requesting. Our budget request of $150 million for
FY 2025 is for an increase of $10 million, which the President
provided. We project that $10 million would allow us to fill just 20
more positions--still far fewer than we need--and provide much-needed
program enhancements, including investment in Zero Trust.
Again, our budget request is a modest investment that would allow
the agency to advance and grow with the ever-evolving transportation
industry. To continue as the world's preeminent safety agency,
completing our investigations and developing recommendations that
advance safety changes without delays, we must meet the challenges that
come with increasing growth and innovation in transportation.
Therefore, it is critical for the agency to have additional resources
to respond to events without affecting our timeliness, the quality of
our work, or our independence.
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I look forward
to your questions.

Subjects Report.

Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you all, and now we will turn
to questions, and I will let Rick ask the first one.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair, I
appreciate that. The first question is for Administrator Bhatt.
You said that when you look at reconstruction of the
bridge, you look at current standards consistent with law. Does
the current law allow, in a circumstance like this, a rebuild
of a different kind of bridge in order to be eligible for
either Federal funds or for the cost share?
Because you could build one under current standards, and
that could be in violation of what the law under this
circumstance allows you to do. So, can you walk through that a
little bit?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you for the question, sir.
Yes, I think what we are examining and working with
Maryland DOT on--the original bridge was built in the 1970s, a
truss bridge which was common at the time. Today, most of the
bridges that are being replaced that are truss bridges are
being replaced by cable-stayed bridges, different standards.
Obviously, we are going to want to hear from the NTSB on
their final results of that investigation. But under the law,
what we want to do is, when we are replacing a structure of
that size, we want to build it to current standards. And
Maryland DOT will be allowed to do that. What we want to make
sure we are not doing is allowing for any ``betterments'' that
did not exist that would be then covered by the ER Program.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, OK.
Admiral Gautier, the Corps has expended significant
resources in the recovery effort. There is no mechanism for
the--I am sorry, the Coast Guard has. There is no mechanism for
the Coast Guard to recoup that funding, and you are not
typically reimbursed for this kind of work. Yet with a
workforce shortage of about 10 percent, you are closing, you
are downgrading stations within the Coast Guard--not because of
this incident, but that is just what is happening in the Coast
Guard, and we passed a Coast Guard authorization that gets us
to $14\1/2\ billion for 2025 and $15 billion for 2026, so, we
are not near the goal of a $20 billion Service for 2030.
As Congress moves forward with the supplemental
appropriations for the Key Bridge, how is the Coast Guard
thinking about being part of that supplemental appropriation to
get reimbursed to get some cost recovery for your work?
Admiral Gautier. Yes, thanks, Ranking Member.
I don't want to get ahead of the administration on the
plans, the amounts and so on the details of the supplemental,
but the way you have articulated it, first of all, we have been
expending operating funds as we do during emergencies like
this, like we do for hurricane responses and other things. And
we have been keeping close tabs on those. And so far, we have
spent about $20 million of direct and indirect funding on this
particular response.
But what we see in events like this and others like it is
that we do what we call burn readiness, right? So, we have to
have other assets around the area, work harder, to cover for
the boats, aircraft, people who are working these. We have
mobilized now--and I visited the command post--on average, we
have had about 200 individuals at the peak in the command post
per day. That has gone down. We are mobilizing them from around
the country. In fact, most of them are from outside Baltimore
right now.
And so, there is an opportunity cost from the commands that
provide those individuals, and I think what this exposes, sir,
is--and you know us well--is that Coast Guard readiness is
becoming more and more brittle as we fail to have the kind of
consistent budgets reaching that $20 billion a year that the
Coast Guard has articulated. Reaching the $3 billion per year
on our procurement, construction, and improvement double what
we actually receive in order to do the necessary
capitalizations.
And so, this brittleness in our readiness manifests in a
whole bunch of different ways, and we really do appreciate
congressional support and ask for additional support for
appropriations in the future.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, thanks.
General Graham, now to you. It is kind of the same
question, but last week the Corps reprogrammed $20 million in
unused funds from fiscal year 2020, including $1 million out of
my district and from prior-year funds. Do you have an estimate
how many more dollars you might need to reprogram, first?
And second, how are you thinking about a supplemental
appropriation for cost recovery for the Corps?
General Graham. Ranking Member Larsen, thank you for that
question.
Similar to the Coast Guard, we certainly don't want to get
ahead of the administration, but right now, we have been able
to use the project funds. And as your opening statement
indicated, that dredging work that we had planned to do with
those funds in this year will still need to be done.
The emergency reprogramming that I referenced in my opening
statement, most of that money we didn't need. So, where does
that money come from? Mainly it is bid savings. A lot of these
projects had happened during times of COVID, when it was a very
favorable bid environment, and we were able to go back to those
funds. A good example of what some of that might be, a
contractor might put a claim on a project, a request for
equitable adjustment. And a few years later those claims have
been adjudicated. And if we didn't have to pay that request,
then we would unobligate those funds.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes. Mr. Chairman, I am out of
time. I just--if you could indulge me for a moment, not for a
question, but I do want to let Chair Homendy know: I will need
to absorb your first half of your report. It is rather
technical. I am not an engineer, but we will absorb it and get
back to you with some questions on it.
And just as a data point for the committee, the Skagit
River Bridge collapse in 2013 cost a total of $19 million for
the insurer, and took us 10 years to recover $19 million. So,
we should not be thinking of waiting to recover costs from
insurance, the insurer of the carrier or the bridge or
whatever, in order to pay for it. It is going to have to take
place first because it took 10 years to get $19 million. If
that is the average time to get $19 million, we will all be
dead by the time we get the money back from this ocean carrier.
So, just a point, just a data point for folks. Thanks.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. Mr. Crawford.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for
your testimony today.
I want to start by acknowledging the six workers who lost
their lives as a result of the collapse of the Francis Scott
Key Bridge. Obviously, our deepest sympathies go out to their
families and their loved ones.
Hours after the Francis Scott Key Bridge tragically
collapsed, President Biden came out and said it was his
``intention'' that the Federal Government will pay for the
entire cost of reconstructing that bridge. And further, he had
``directed his team to move heaven and earth to reopen the port
and rebuild the bridge as soon as humanly possible.''
Administrator Bhatt, I have a series of questions here as
we try to understand the mechanics of the situation before us.
And if you would, just give me a yes or no response in the
interest of time.
While the bridge was located on I-695 prior to its
collapse, it wasn't actually considered a part of the
interstate, but rather was Maryland State Route 695. Is that
correct?
Mr. Bhatt. Yes.
Mr. Crawford. The bridge had previously never received any
Federal funding. Is that correct?
Mr. Bhatt. Yes.
Mr. Crawford. I understand that Federal Highways has since
approved a request by Maryland to designate the bridge as
interstate. Is that correct?
Mr. Bhatt. Yes.
Mr. Crawford. Meaning the Federal share for reconstruction
under the Emergency Relief Program will now be 90 percent. Is
that correct?
Mr. Bhatt. Yes, instead of 80.
Mr. Crawford. So, what we are talking about here is a delta
of 10 percent for a bridge that previously never received any
Federal funding.
Mr. Bhatt. Yes.
Mr. Crawford. OK. In your testimony you mentioned that
authorizing a 100-percent Federal cost share would be
consistent with past catastrophic bridge collapses. How many
times has Congress authorized a 100-percent Federal share for a
fully collapsed bridge?
Mr. Bhatt. So, the--I think the reference point we are
using is the I-35W collapse in Minnesota.
Mr. Crawford. OK. Some say that we need 100 percent Federal
funding so we can get the rebuilding done quickly, but that is
not how the ER Program works. It is a reimbursement program,
correct?
Mr. Bhatt. Absolutely.
Mr. Crawford. As I understand it, the ER financing process,
generally, individual States, the division offices, and the
program office have a process to make sure that projects are
ready to receive funding, and work can be completed in a
specified time period. Is that right?
Mr. Bhatt. Yes.
Mr. Crawford. So, it doesn't really matter if a project is
getting 80 percent Federal share, 90 percent, or even 100
percent. The reimbursement is based on project progress and
delivery. Correct?
Mr. Bhatt. Yes.
Mr. Crawford. I just want to be clear that nothing is going
to move faster if this is 100 percent Federal-funded versus 90
percent or any other percentage. Whether the State contributes
money or not, the process for awarding Federal reimbursement is
still the same. Correct?
Mr. Bhatt. Can I just deviate from the yes-no for a second?
Mr. Crawford. Go ahead.
Mr. Bhatt. Yes. However, the 10 percent--so, this is the
second largest ER request we have ever received; $2.2 billion
for Katrina was the first one, so, $1.7 to $1.9 billion. So,
that 10-percent delta is about $170 to $190 million for the
State of Maryland that, as they are programing out their
multiyear, multibillion-dollar program, it may not be this
project, but it may have impacts on other projects.
Mr. Crawford. OK. Let me just briefly, in the time that I
have left, let's talk about the regulatory regime that will be
applied here.
Are we going to expect any kind of waivers or anything like
that on NEPA or any other regulatory compliance measures that
would be customary on any other construction project?
Mr. Bhatt. So, sir, we would not waive NEPA or any of the
environmental requirements. But what we have done is
coordinated with our agencies who issue permits, and it is our
intention, because the bridge previously existed in this
relative footprint, that it would be likely a categorical
exclusion, which would minimize the time.
Mr. Crawford. Expand on categorical exclusion. What does
that mean?
Mr. Bhatt. So, when you go through NEPA, you can either do,
like, a full environmental impact statement, we could get to a
finding of ``no significant impact'' on environmental
assessment. A categorical exclusion is sort of the more time-
limited finding. And the reason we would use that basis here is
because the bridge previously existed, and we are putting a
bridge back relatively in the same footprint.
Mr. Crawford. You are putting it back in the same spot, but
not necessarily--because you are probably going to use a
different kind of construction, would there be some associated
flow studies, for example, to address the new construction?
Mr. Bhatt. So, that is why we are coordinating with our
sister agencies who issue the permit, because it is, as I said,
relatively in that same footprint but probably going to use
different piers, it is probably going to have a little bit of
tweaking to the approaches, a different height than was there
before. So, that is why I can't say definitively that it will
be a categorical exclusion. It is what we are working towards.
Mr. Crawford. So, it sounds to me like there is going to be
a great deal of flexibility in the interest of getting this
thing restored, rebuilt, and restoring traffic and commerce and
everything associated with that bridge. Is that correct?
Mr. Bhatt. I am not sure if flexibility is the right word.
I think attention from the sister agencies, and understanding
that there is a desire to move quickly.
Mr. Crawford. And I am all for that. And I hope that in the
future that other projects are given the same consideration
because time is money. And I understand that that is certainly
the case here, but there are a lot of other projects out there
pending that have cost millions in regulatory compliance fees
that have really been delayed as a result. So, thank you.
And I yield back.
Mr. Bhatt. Yes, sir.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. Ms. Norton.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Administrator Bhatt, Department of Transportation data show
that traffic crashes rose 29 percent on alternative routes in
the weeks following the Key Bridge collapse. The same data show
that it now takes between two and four times longer for drivers
to travel those alternative routes. That traffic means trucks
are delayed in reaching their destinations, commuters are late
getting to their jobs or home to their families, and there is
more air pollution and wasted fuel.
How has the loss of the Key Bridge hurt traffic safety and
reduced mobility for drivers in the Baltimore region?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you for the question.
I think we saw in Philadelphia after I-95--we had that
bridge collapse--that there was just all kinds of traffic
moving through neighborhoods and trying to find their way, and
I think a similar effect is happening in Baltimore.
Usually, when you have an impact where you remove a
significant piece of infrastructure, traffic seems to level out
after a while. That is not happening here in Baltimore to the
same extent, and I think it is because of just the criticality
of this artery. It is part of the Northeast Corridor, it is
important for Maryland, it is important for Baltimore, but it
is also important for the Northeast Corridor.
And so, yes, there are trucks and vehicles moving through
neighborhoods that they would not normally be on, and that is
why it is so critically important that we move with as much
speed as possible.
Ms. Norton. Administrator Bhatt, it is clear that we need
to restore commerce to the Port of Baltimore and rebuild the
bridge to improve safety and mobility in the region. The full
Maryland delegation has proposed legislation to provide 100
percent Federal share for the cost of the new bridge. I
wholeheartedly support this legislation.
What effect would the 100-percent Federal share have on
efforts to rebuild the bridge quickly?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Representative, for the question.
I have spent a lot of time running State DOTs in my career.
I have been on the private side, so--I was with AECOM before
this job that works on bridges across the globe. And I would
just say what the benefit of the 100-percent share brings is
just it removes an element of uncertainty.
So, right now, I think Maryland--and I have to commend
Maryland DOT, just really been consummate professionals
throughout this process--right now, what they are contemplating
is an ER shortage that we have told them about, that we have
$3.7 billion in unmet needs, as the Federal Highway
Administration, with about $870 million available for
nationwide ER efforts. And so, we are telling them we believe
that we will have the ER funding there for you. And then they
have the uncertainty of the 90 percent versus the 100 percent.
We did remove the 80 percent uncertainty.
And so, as you are planning out these multiyear,
multibillion-dollar construction programs, not knowing whether
or not that $170 million is going to be there, does it impact
things right now at this moment? No, they are going to move
forward. But as they are projecting out and as they are trying
to build their construction program, other contractors, it just
is an element of uncertainty. That would be helpful.
And just to clarify on the 100 percent, obviously, any
insurance payments, as the ranking member had mentioned, would
be reapplied. So, I can pretty much with certainty guarantee
this will not be 100 percent federally funded eventually,
because we will recoup all of the insurance payments as
possible, and they will go back in to the ER funds. But as the
ranking member mentioned, we don't want to wait through all of
the litigation and the NTSB investigations, insurance issues
for that.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. Mr. Webster.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for
putting this together. It is very informative. Thank you,
witnesses.
Last week the Army Corps notified congressional offices
that they would be utilizing the emergency reprogramming
authority to the program to reprogram approximately $33 million
of previously appropriated operation and Harbor Maintenance
Trust Fund dollars for recovery costs imposed by the collapse
of the Key Bridge.
Nearly $1 million was reappropriated from projects in
Florida without any request for input from the congressional
delegation, the State, or the people. While the recovery effort
in Baltimore is important, this reprogramming of the funds
represents a blatant disregard for Florida and desperately
needed improvements to our water resources and infrastructure.
General Graham, if these recently reprogrammed funds were
deemed to be in excess, why did the Corps let these funds sit
for years and not act sooner to reprogram them towards projects
locally in Florida?
And will the Corps plan to reimburse the South Atlantic
Division for these funds?
General Graham. Congressman Webster, thank you for that
question.
The example I used earlier of some of the funds that we had
set aside for when a contractor put a claim, that was from
Jacksonville, and that was from the Jacksonville District, and
it was Jacksonville Harbor. So, in this case, those funds, I
think $300,000-some, are no longer needed for the Jacksonville
Harbor project. So, those funds in particular that we had set
them aside for a need, and that need didn't materialize, we
will not seek recoupment for those.
We did do this work, this emergency reprogramming work,
Congressman, very rapidly. And we--as I stated in my opening
statement, we haven't used this authority at this scale for 15
years, and we are a little clunky at it in terms of our
notification to you and your staffs. If we--and I will use
Jacksonville District as an example--if there are some of those
funds that they do find a need for, we will figure out a way to
make sure that the projects continue.
To your first comment on some of those old funds that have
been sitting out there for a while, why hadn't we cleaned up
the books sooner? Sir, you are absolutely right. We should
have.
Mr. Webster of Florida. As you know better than most, the
Gulf States fought against the National Contingency Plan
Unified Command structure response throughout the Deepwater
Horizon oilspill. The National Incident Commander's Report
concluded the States' efforts resulted in the political and
social nullification of the oilspill response doctrine and
structure governance. It appears that the press reports that
meetings with Maryland State officials and a number of staff
member trips to the wreck site--that Maryland embraced the
National Incident Command structure, and that it has worked
well within that structure.
Is the National Incident Command structure still an
effective and efficient mechanism for coordinating Federal
interagency and State-local-Federal interactions during the
incident such as the Dali?
Admiral Gautier. Congressman, if that is for me, I can't
agree more with your statement.
As the chief of staff for Admiral Allen on the Deepwater
Horizon spill, and now being someone who has been witness to
the terrific work in the unified effort on this one, it has
been very, very different in terms of cooperation and
collaboration. Underpinning that is the absolute necessity and
the benefit of the Incident Command System under the National
Incident Management System framework that has served this
response incredibly well. It is the doctrine of the U.S. Any
agency, entity--Army Corps, State--can come together with a
common lexicon, a common way of planning to come together and
make this work.
But I would also like to highlight a real difference that
has made a difference, and that is that elected leadership and
the operational leadership has been connected in a very
constructive way, from Governor Moore to Mayor Scott to Members
of Congress from the Maryland delegation, they have taken it
upon themselves to get regular updates and a great interest in
the progress and the response. They have handled for the
Unified Command a lot of the public affairs and external
communications in a very constructive way. And they have
actually provided the trade space for the operational response
to continue on without pressure, without being rushed. It has
been very constructive.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you very much.
I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. Mr. Cohen.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member
Larsen, for holding this important hearing on the Federal
response to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse in Maryland.
Further, I extend my condolences to the families of the six
individuals who lost their lives during the collapse.
I thank our esteemed witnesses for appearing here today,
especially Administrator Bhatt, who was with us in Memphis on
Monday.
I appreciate your coming to see the I-55 bridge and the
urgent need to replace it across the Mississippi River in
Memphis and West Memphis. That is, of course, as you well know,
a national treasure to have transportation going across the
country there at I-40. We had the I-40 bridge--we had a problem
last year and shut down. The I-55 bridge could have the same
problem, because it is in the New Madrid earthquake fault zone,
which is predicted to occur, it has been predicted for about 20
years, but it is going to occur, and it is more likely sooner
than later.
As you all look at the damages to the Key Bridge, which
were caused partially, I think, because it wasn't built to
withstand that large of a boat, it could have been maybe--piers
could have been buttressed and made it more stable, is that
correct?
Mr. Bhatt, can you answer that?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Representative Cohen. And yes, it was
good to spend some time with you in Memphis looking at that
bridge.
I think one of the things we are waiting for--and it was
great to see the preliminary report from the NTSB, but I think
we are going to be working closely with the NTSB just to figure
out exactly what types of protection might be needed for
bridges and what could have been possible. But again, I don't
want to step into the NTSB realm.
Mr. Cohen. I am sorry. Please.
Ms. Homendy. Thank you, sir. For the Key Bridge, we are,
obviously, looking at--there were two dolphins on the east
side, two on the west side. They are rather small, and the
vessel just sort of bypassed the dolphins. What ended up
striking the pier was the starboard side of the bow that hit
the column. The pier protection around the column itself is
timber, concrete, a little bit of steel, but it is very close
in to the pier itself.
Other structures that we are looking at have pier
protection that comes out farther so that a vessel can't get to
the column. Other dolphins are much larger. So, we are looking
at other structures across the United States to see what might
be good models.
I think the key here is you have a bridge that was opened
in 1977, and over time, it's not the bridge that's getting
larger, it's not the waterway that's getting larger, it's the
vessels that are getting larger, and not just width, but
height, with containers. And so, it is important that States
and other bridge owners are looking at, from a risk assessment
standpoint, what is now going through, what is the vessel
traffic, and how is our infrastructure protected.
Mr. Cohen. So, were there bridges built after 1977 that
were built in a fashion that they would have been able to
withstand such an impact?
Ms. Homendy [to Mr. Bhatt]. You have to----
Mr. Bhatt. So, thank you, Congressman, for the question. It
is an important question. We are working with our State DOT
partners to identify all of the bridges that are subject to
seagoing vessels. Also, in the Great Lakes region, barge
traffic on the Mississippi and other waterways.
I think what this bridge has done is driven home that need
to look at many of our bridges which are older, and look at
that protection, and we are going to rely on the NTSB
recommendations.
Again, there was a lot of force. I mean, I have heard
different analogies of the force, the equivalent of a rocket
ship taking off. And so, we just want to be careful in our
consideration of how we both protect and build bridges in the
21st century as they are dealing with these new potential
threats.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you. I just would like to urge you, as I
did in Memphis, that we need to look at preventative measures
so we don't have another Francis Scott Key Bridge disaster. And
earthquakes would cause that. And there is no place in the
United States, I think, more vulnerable than the New Madrid
fault and the I-55 bridge that was built before there were
seismic standards. They were not part of the bridge.
So, it is deficient, needs to be replaced, and I hope that
you will look in terms, just as this disaster, at bridges that
we fund under the bipartisan infrastructure bill, be ones that
might be susceptible to either earth, God-created--I hate to
say God, I hate to give God the responsibility, but disasters
that are caused by other than man-made disasters.
I yield back, and I thank you for coming, and Elvis thanks
you, too.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. Mr. Perry.
Mr. Perry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I will begin by just offering my condolences to the family.
And I think it underscores the circumstance, underscores how
potentially horrific, almost unimaginable, what might be seen
as mundane work can end up being at a critical moment. It is
unimaginable, as you can imagine yourself at 2 or 3 o'clock in
the morning, falling 100, 200 feet into the water, steel and
concrete crashing around you.
With that, Administrator Bhatt, the Francis Scott Key
Bridge was a toll facility that never received any Federal
funding prior to the collapse. Right?
Mr. Bhatt. Yes, sir.
Mr. Perry. And how much revenue did the State of Maryland
receive or generate from the bridge on an annual basis, if you
know?
Mr. Bhatt. Sir, I would have to doublecheck. I don't want
to give you a false----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. OK, I don't know if you would
have a different figure than I do. I have got about $56.8
million in 2023, just for your reference. So, that is what they
were taking in.
Under the current law and under this administration's plan,
the bridge would get 100 percent share. So, the Federal
Government would pay 100 percent of that. And while you say
that this is consistent with bridge collapse emergencies in the
past--and I think you are referring to the I-35 collapse--that
was not a toll bridge, right? That was part of the interstate
system.
And so, my questions, I guess, center around payment for
this. I think we can all agree that we probably and shouldn't
wait for the insurance companies and the litigators to work it
out, but Maryland had insurance on the bridge, didn't they?
Mr. Bhatt. Sir, I am aware of one policy that Maryland has
for $350 million.
Mr. Perry. $350 million, right?
Mr. Bhatt. Yes.
Mr. Perry. So, that should, by all rights, you would
assume, be actioned and go towards paying for a portion,
whatever portion of the bridge reconstruction it would pay for,
right? It would----
Mr. Bhatt [interrupting]. Absolutely, sir. We just--I have
yet to go through and----
Mr. Perry [interposing]. I understand.
Mr. Bhatt [continuing]. Have our lawyers figure out exactly
what is in there. But yes, whatever portion of that $350
million we would apply.
Mr. Perry. So, I guess, when you say consistent with past
emergencies, as you already said, the relief fund is $3.7
billion behind. We are $35 trillion this month in debt at the
Federal level. And I wonder if you think it is fair that the
American taxpayer should not only pay to reconstruct the
bridge, but then pay tolls after which to use the
infrastructure they just paid for in their taxes. Is that--
because you are going to set a new precedent here. And is that
the precedent we are going to set?
Or is there some plan to recoup the cost of reconstruction
of the bridge?
And I think, according to the figures we have heard today,
upwards of $2 billion, a bridge that originally cost $60.3
million. Is there some plan to recoup that and send that back
into the Disaster Relief Fund or to the Highway Trust Fund,
which continually needs massive infusions from the general fund
just to stay afloat? What is the plan?
Mr. Bhatt. Yes, thank you sir, very important questions,
and I appreciate your interest. So, let me just try to quickly
go through that.
Where this was a Maryland State facility before, now it has
been designated as part of the interstate system. They were
free before to collect their tolls and use them for maybe Port
of Baltimore, whatever they were using them for. Now, since
this has been Federalized as a facility, and going forward when
the tolls are restored, as part of the interstate system it
will now--they will have to use those for title 23-eligible
funding, so, whether it is the maintenance of the existing
bridge or other title 23 highway purposes in Maryland. So, the
American taxpayer will be benefiting from those tolls.
In terms of the precedent, if it was a pre-existing toll
facility, they are allowed to toll the facility going forward.
But again, it would be using title 23-eligible expenditures on
those tolls.
Mr. Perry. I understand the title 23 expenditures, and
understand that they would be used for surface transportation
in Maryland. But you are asking the taxpayers from across the
country to pay for it. And if you are from Washington State,
likely you are never going to travel across that bridge, but
you are sure going to pay for it.
And as long as we are setting precedent, I think it would
be appropriate at least to consider reimbursing through the
tolls the emergency fund or the transportation fund for the
entire country before all of the money goes right back to the
State that is going to be receiving it where the bridge
resides, which arguably I think can be said was not prepared to
withstand the traffic impact that it had. Meanwhile, it is
right there. I mean, it is not like it was a surprise that the
bridge is there, and ships are going under it, and this could
happen.
So, with that in mind, with the time that I have already
expended and expired, I hope you would consider a plan to
reimburse the taxpayer under horrific debt right now who can't
afford their groceries, their gas bills, their daycare bills
for the cost of this bridge for which one State has been
receiving all the money for its entire existence, and
apparently is going to receive all the money from the tolls for
the rest of its existence.
And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance.
Mr. Rouzer [presiding]. Mr. Garamendi, you are recognized.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the
hearing.
Witnesses, Vice Admiral and General, you and your teams and
the support organizations that you have contracted with are
doing extraordinary work, and we thank you for that.
The issue before this committee was pretty much laid out by
the chairman in his opening remarks, and I would suggest that
we have an opportunity to clarify the responsibilities, some of
which we heard from the previous Member just a moment ago. A
couple of things here.
First of all, the notion--President Biden is correct, OK?
We will put up the full cost of reconstruction. However, that
legislation should be written in such a way that the Federal
Government will be reimbursed for any money received in the
liability issues, the $350 million that the State of Maryland
had as an insurance policy on the bridge, as well as whatever
other payment may come from lawsuits against the shipping
company and the owners of the ship. So, we should--and this
should be, really, the work of this committee--is to carefully
structure the legislation so that the Federal Government,
ponying up the 100 percent at the outset, would be fully
reimbursed by any revenues.
My colleague raised an interesting point about tolls. We
should consider that, and how that fits into it, and keep in
mind the entire interstate system, where tolls are collected in
various places across the United States. So, those are things
that are out there.
There is also one other issue that I want to encourage this
committee to deal with, in addition to recovering whatever
money might be available from lawsuits, and that is the Limit
of Liability Act of 1851. It seems as though perhaps even that
is--precedes the law in Arizona which dealt with a different
issue. That Limit of Liability Act really has to change, and I
would urge the committee to take up this issue. I intend to
present to the committee at the appropriate time a piece of
legislation to do so, so that the owners of these vessels would
be held responsible for the cost of their mistakes. And that--
right now, that limited liability would hold that the owner of
the ship would be limited to $40-some million, even though the
ship is worth $90 million or more, and the damage is somewhere
around $2 billion, not including the cost of the recovery
issues and the expenses that the Coast Guard and the Army Corps
of Engineers are now incurring.
So, my point here is to raise this policy issue and,
really, the work of this committee as we go forward. I think
the chairman correctly pointed out that we don't need to do
much for the next couple of months, but this year, we have to
pass legislation to clarify the ability of the Federal
Government to receive any funds that are available from various
lawsuits that are out there.
And also, this committee should, since it is our
jurisdictional area, deal with this 1851 law that limits the
liability of the shipowner to any accident and problem that
they may cause.
Now, I don't know if this is an appropriate question for
the general and the vice admiral, but you are welcome to jump
in if you would like.
But I think, Mr. Bhatt--and if you might comment on this
issue--about how we might structure legislation to recover
whatever fee, whatever damages may be in the future from either
insurance or lawsuits.
You can look for help, but you won't----
Mr. Bhatt [interrupting]. No, I just--you referenced them,
and I just--I am taking a lot of answers, so----
Mr. Garamendi [interposing]. It's all yours.
Mr. Bhatt. I don't want to--I am happy to share the time.
So, under the ER Program, under the existing law as it
states, any insurance moneys that are recouped for any ER event
across the country do go directly back into the ER fund. So,
the ranking member mentioned the $19 million Skagit River
Bridge, and I think it was actually about $16.6 million that
was recovered through insurance. It went directly back in, but,
as he said correctly, 10 years after the incident.
So, whether it is the $350 million insurance policy that
Maryland has existing or post-investigation and post-legal
activity going on for as long as that may be, we will recover
all of that money and send it back in. But as you correctly
point out, there are some questions about how much liability
for the shipowner that is out there.
Mr. Garamendi. That is a question, really, that should be
addressed to the Coast Guard who might want to comment on it.
But I am out of time now, so, I will yield.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman's time has expired.
Mr. Babin, you are recognized.
Dr. Babin. Sir, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to
the witnesses for being here and your testimonies.
I think there is definitely some resentment among my
colleagues and the American public about this incident. The
perception here is really frustrating, and some of you have
already addressed some of these, but I would like to ask my
questions.
If you zoom out, the Singapore-flagged vessel crashes into
and completely destroys a historic bridge, kills six
construction workers, and is now trying to avoid liability for
the incident. People have a lot of questions: Is it safe for
foreign-flagged vessels to operate in U.S. waterways? Are other
bridges safe? I have heard a number of questions wondering
whether their bridges are safe. Was this incident a result of
foul play or negligence? What can we do to prevent this from
ever happening again? And who is going to pay for this thing?
And I appreciate you all for coming and answering
questions. My first question is for Admiral Gautier. If anyone
else has thoughts, please feel free to jump in.
I know this whole response is a great team effort, but
first off, I am told the Coast Guard is doing a great job
leading the way in the unified response in Baltimore, so, I
want to thank you and the Coast Guard for your commitment and
all the hard work that you and the Coast Guard have done.
As you all know better than most, the Gulf States fought
against the National Contingency Plan Unified Command structure
response throughout the Deepwater Horizon oilspill a few years
ago in the Gulf of Mexico. The National Incident Commander's
Report concluded that the Gulf States' effort resulted in the
political and social nullification of the oilspill response
doctrine and structure governance.
It appears from press reports, meetings with Maryland State
officials, and Member and staff trips to the wreck site, that
Maryland embraced the National Incident Command structure, and
that the response has worked well within that structure. Is the
National Incident Command structure still an effective and
efficient mechanism for coordinating Federal interagency and
State-local-Federal interactions during incidents such as the
Dali allision?
Admiral Gautier. Congressman, thank you very much, first
off, for the compliments to the Coast Guard. I just have to
also acknowledge the leadership of Colonel Pinchasin, Army
Corps of Engineers; Colonel Butler, Jim Harkins, and Jeff
Donoho, who are the State incident commanders. It is a
fantastic leadership team.
To answer your question, the Incident Command System is
absolutely a fundamental principle by which this incident
response has been successful. It is part of U.S. doctrine under
the National Incident Management System. It is how we respond
to hurricanes, oilspills, other types of incidents just like
this. I think we now have a great deal of practice in the
United States since the Deepwater Horizon in doing this.
And I think what I will just observe is that this
particular incident had a very tight connection between the
operational commanders who were running the incident and
elected leaders who all shared the same objectives. The elected
leaders took the time and effort--Governor, mayor, Members of
Congress--to keep up to date on what was going on and to
provide the trade space to allow these folks to get on with the
response.
Dr. Babin. OK, thank you. The second question I would like
to address to Administrator Bhatt.
I would like to talk about the path forward from here for
the Key Bridge. What is the plan to replace the bridge?
My constituents are not wanting to pay for this thing. In
my view, the company or the country responsible for the
incident should be footing the bill, not the U.S. taxpayer. If
the U.S. is ultimately going to pay for this bridge, it better
come out of funds that we have already allocated.
President Biden and Speaker Pelosi authorized trillions for
infrastructure, and that should be including bridges. The last
thing I want to do is to vote to spend another $1 or $2 billion
on a new bridge. So, Administrator Bhatt, talk to me on what
you see as a path forward here on the payment for this thing.
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Congressman. And just in terms of the
rebuild path, Maryland DOT plans to issue their RFP close to
Memorial Day. They will select a preferred team in August, and
then they are looking at construction completion in 2028 as a
preliminary schedule.
And in terms of the payment, as I have stated, right now,
there is a preliminary estimate, $1.7 to $1.9 billion. There is
a $350 million insurance payment that we are working through to
see what level of that would be applicable. And any funds that
are recovered through legal activity or insurance payouts will
go back into the ER funds. We just don't have a path to getting
there right now in terms of what is eligible.
Dr. Babin. OK, I am out of time, so, I yield back, Mr.
Chairman.
Thank you all.
Mr. Graves of Missouri [presiding]. Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for
holding this very important hearing, and thank you to the
witnesses for appearing, and thank you for the work that you
have been doing to ameliorate the harm that has been caused by
this bridge collapse.
And I also want to offer my condolences to the families of
the six construction workers who were killed in this bridge
collapse.
And I would like to commend the quick work of the police
officers who made sure that traffic was stopped and no other
people were on the bridge who could have been killed as a
result of this collapse.
And I also want to recognize the collaboration between
State and Federal officials and agencies to address this
situation.
And I want to get at this issue of perhaps there being some
people in the country who are not inside the State of Maryland
who resent having to pay for this bridge reconstruction.
Administrator Bhatt, can you tell us how this bridge
collapse impacts interstate commerce?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you for your condolences and for the
question, Congressman.
I have been the secretary of transportation in Delaware, in
Colorado, and I was a deputy in Kentucky. And I think that what
is so critically important for our transportation system is
that you can drive from New York to Los Angeles across a system
that is completely uniform, is set to standards.
And what is happening--I think we have learned through the
Port of Baltimore--is that that highway system is tied into
ports. It is the third busiest port in the country. So, there
are jobs that are being impacted. There are freight movements
that are being impacted. There are neighborhoods that are being
impacted.
And so, yes, this is not just an issue for Maryland. It is
an issue for the Northeast Corridor and for our national
economy.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. It is actually having an impact on
prices for consumer goods. Is that correct?
Mr. Bhatt. Well, that is something that, under the
leadership of Secretary Buttigieg, we have been closely looking
at many of the goods that move through there. So, there is a
lot of coal that moves through that port. There are a lot of
automobiles and farm equipment. And so, to the extent--now,
there is--a lot of that traffic has been diverted--and I don't
want to get outside of the Federal highway lane--to other
ports. But there are a lot of movements of goods from, say,
ships that have diverted back to Maryland, and that is adding
costs for those same vehicles to be finished at the plants
nearby.
So, obviously----
Mr. Johnson of Georgia [interposing]. All right.
Mr. Bhatt [continuing]. Supply chain is important.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. OK, thank you. When is it
projected, assuming that funding is in place, that the bridge
can be rebuilt and reopened?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, sir. The projected schedule right now
is for a progressive design-build team to be selected this
summer, and for construction to begin next year and run through
2028.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. And so, it would be 2029
before the bridge would reopen for traffic?
Mr. Bhatt. Yes, 2028, 2029. It will be a progressive
design-build, so, we will figure out the schedule as we go.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you.
Chairwoman Homendy, with respect to the causation of this
cargo vessel losing power and that causing it, this vessel, to
drift into the bridge, are there any concerns?
Or does the fact that there was no--there seems to be no
redundancy in terms of the basic power of the vessel--there is
no redundancy. You cut it on, you cut it--it gets cut off,
there is no secondary situation that would kick in. Am I
correct on that?
And if I am correct, what are the implications as we move
forward?
Ms. Homendy. Yes, I mean, there is certainly redundancy in
the electrical system and the circuitbreakers. They switched
circuitbreakers after the power outages in port.
With respect to the emergency generator, it would not allow
for regaining propulsion. It really focuses on the critical
portions of the vessel, which would be radio communication,
lighting. If you had any sort of--if you wanted to regain
propulsion through any sort of emergency generator, it would
literally take a six-story generator on a vessel to do that.
There is redundancy in, say, cruise ships. But vessels--the
Dali is not unlike other vessels.
I think here is really determining, for us, what happened
with the electrical system on the accident voyage, what
happened in those two blackouts, which is why we have been
working very closely with Hyundai, who manufactures the
equipment, to try to replicate some of the electrical problems
that we are seeing that day, and continue looking and testing
each of the components.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. Mr. Graves.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I first want to join others in wishing condolences to the
families of those who were lost in the bridge collapse.
And also, I just find it remarkable, the incredible action
of the law enforcement community that came in and stopped
traffic. That could have been much worse than it was.
Last week, I had the opportunity to go out to the bridge.
And Admiral, I will tell you that--Admiral, it was Gilreath,
right? Right. Admiral Gilreath, and Captain O'Donnell, and even
Lieutenant Carter, who was behind you a little while ago, just
absolutely remarkable.
General, Colonel, your district commander down there--
Colonel Pinchasin, I believe--yes, she was awesome. I met her
down in New Orleans, and she and her team did a great job.
There were folks from DHS that were really, really good. And I
just--an incredibly thorough briefing, and gave lots of comfort
that things were under control. And I appreciate all the
efforts that are underway down there.
Administrator, I want to ask a question. I want to make
sure I understand something. You said earlier that what is
being done on this bridge is consistent with what has been done
in other bridges in the past for disasters. Is that accurate?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Representative, I am trying to think
of what I said----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. I wrote down that
you said consistent with historic bridge disasters. But there
is not another bridge where you just--where FHWA came in and
just designated that it is going to be part of the interstate
system.
Mr. Bhatt. No, we only learned that it was not part of the
interstate system in light of this event.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. OK. So, that is an anomaly. I
just----
Mr. Bhatt [interposing]. Absolutely.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. OK, I want to be clear on that.
And then, secondly, so, you have talked about the use of
categorical exclusions and doing some type of expedited NEPA.
Whether you do a CATEX or you do alternative arrangements, I
want to be clear, I am fully supportive of it. But in the past,
the Minneapolis bridge, the I-35 bridge, I believe the bridge
in Washington State and others, similar things have been done.
Can you cite where there has been environmental damages or
destruction from that approach, as opposed to going through the
regular NEPA?
Mr. Bhatt. So, just trying to think through your question,
citing environmental damage by using the expedited approach?
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Mm-hmm.
Mr. Bhatt. No, I can't cite environmental damage----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. And I can't either.
And actually, Colonel--excuse me, Major General Graham, sorry
about that, I demoted you--General, you recall after Hurricane
Katrina, the levees were built using alternative arrangements.
Do you remember any type of environmental damages or
destruction that was caused from doing the alternative
arrangements?
General Graham. No.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Yes, I don't think so, either. I
think it actually worked out really well.
And so, my message to you on this is that right now the
average road project takes somewhere around 7 years and 3 or 4
months. As you know, the White House has just released new
rules on NEPA in line with the fiscal--well, attempting to be
in line with the Fiscal Responsibility Act, but failing on some
things, but--that would significantly shorten it. But my
message is that this shouldn't be the exception. Environmental
damages haven't resulted from using categorical exclusions or
alternative arrangements.
Look, I don't know what the traffic impacts are of this
bridge. We have a bridge at home that is the source of the
fourth worst traffic problem in America. The Mississippi River
bridge, I-10, I-10 going from California to Florida, fourth
worst traffic in America. We have taken 7 years to narrow a new
bridge alignment down to 32 alignments. Like, you can't make
this stuff up. This is outrageous. We have urgency there, as
well.
Look, I want to be crystal clear. I fully support, fully
support Federal funding upfront. Let's get this thing built.
Let's get it done as quickly as possible. I fully support
categorical exclusion or alternative arrangements. I have been
in touch with the Governor of Maryland, and I appreciate him
reaching out, but this is a major anomaly. We have got a toll,
we have got a responsible party. This isn't a natural disaster,
and I think that we need to make sure that we are holding the
responsible party accountable.
We had a similar incident in Louisiana in the mid-1990s.
The Bright Field--the Bright Field incident--came and crashed
into the Riverwalk in Louisiana. That was a Japanese-built
vessel, it was run by Chinese--or excuse me, it was, I think,
run by the Chinese and flagged in Liberia.
Admiral, I want to ask you real quick, can you think of any
similar incidents with Jones Act vessels that have occurred
like this?
Admiral Gautier. Not from deep draft vessels. Certainly,
there are a number of towing vessels in the rivers----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. Sure, some barges
and much more----
Admiral Gautier [continuing]. Barges----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [continuing]. Minor incidents.
Chairman, how many--are you aware of anything?
[Nonverbal response.]
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. And so, look, one thing I just--I
want to point out here--and for the record, she is shaking her
head no.
One thing I want to point out here. Look, Jones Act
vessels, U.S.-built, U.S.-crewed, U.S.-flagged. We go through
annual inspections. A night-and-day difference. And I think
that is something else we need to take into consideration here.
Lastly, Administrator, this bridge, it is not going to be
built back exactly like it was, will it? It is going to be
wider, you are going to have shoulders, you are going to have a
different pier configuration, you are going to have different
tidal influences, you are going to have bumpers, you are going
to have dolphins and other things protecting the pier
structures. Is that correct?
Mr. Bhatt. Yes, sir.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. OK, all right. I just want to make
sure that we are noting that this is actually a different
bridge that is being reconstructed with effectively waiving or
providing alternative arrangements or categorical exclusions
under NEPA.
I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. Ms. Titus.
Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And like everyone here,
I, too, offer sympathy to the families of those who were lost.
These people represent sometimes the invisible folks who are on
the front lines who provide safety and security in our
infrastructure, and also the harbor workers and police officers
who were there and made the situation much less terrible than
it already was.
I would ask the Chairwoman and Administrator Bhatt about
one of the things that has been pointed out in the study of the
bridge. It seems like it didn't have a reliable fender system--
I believe it is called--to protect the piers from the crash.
And I wonder if you have reviewed bridges in other major ports
to determine whether or not they have those fenders in place?
And if not, is there an existing program with funding that
might be used to retrofit some of those other bridges to be
sure they don't have the same problem we can be--I hate the
word, but--proactive about that?
Ms. Homendy. Thank you for the question. We have actually
been recommending--we recommended back in 1988 that the Coast
Guard and the Federal Highways evaluate the adequacy of pier
protection on bridges over navigable waterways in U.S. ports
and harbors. That recommendation remains ``closed,
unacceptable'' because at the time the Coast Guard said they
did not have the authority to take action on that evaluation.
But if I--one thing I will say, and I hope that we walk
away from this in considering, is the Federal Government states
the bridge owners, they need to evaluate current structures and
make sure, if you have navigable waterway, that you are doing a
risk analysis to ensure safety, to ensure there is adequate
pier protection.
In this situation, we are looking at pier protection. We
are looking at, certainly, the dolphins, but then the
protection around the piers themselves, and then looking at
different bridges across the United States to see how those
have been improved over time. In this situation, you have a
bridge that began operations in 1977. And if it was built
today, it would be built differently. And so, that has to be
taken into consideration.
I will say I am very encouraged by what the Admiral
announced, their board of inquiry--about looking at ports
across the United States to make sure there is adequate
protection. And I assume that it will include some of the
structures, as well, including bridges. So, that's great.
Ms. Titus. Administrator Bhatt, would you like to comment
on that?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Congresswoman. And yes, we are
obviously working closely with the NTSB, and I just really
respect their thoughts and guidance.
We have already reached out to our State DOT partners, who
are the owners of these bridges. Similar to when there is any
kind of bridge tragedy after Minnesota, everybody is reaching
out to figure out what fracture critical bridges they had. And
so, we are going to go out. We have already got a preliminary
list. We are going to continue to identify.
And again, it is the deep draft vessels. It is the barges.
It is examining all the threats, and then doing that cost-
benefit analysis of what protections are sort of quickly
deployable. How do we get these bridges protected, and then how
do we update design standards, given the ever-changing nature
of the vessels going underneath them?
Ms. Titus. Well, can you use--I believe the acronym is
BFP--Bridge Replacement, Rehabilitation, Preservation,
Protection, and Construction Program? Is that available with
any kind of funding, or that can be used to retrofit some of
these bridges if they don't meet these requirements you are
talking about?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Congresswoman, yes. So, in the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, there was $12.5 billion
allocated for discretionary grant funding and about, I think,
$30 billion on the formula side. Seismic protection, as has
been--retrofitting is possible. And this is something that we
are going to look into as we work with our State partners who
are applying for those funds.
Ms. Titus. Well, as you look into it, if you find any
problems with the program that won't allow it to work towards
retrofitting in a situation like this or make it more
difficult, will you let us know, so, if we need to make some
changes, we can address those legislatively?
Mr. Bhatt. Yes, ma'am.
Ms. Titus. Thank you, I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [presiding]. Thank you, the
gentlelady yields back. The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr.
Rouzer, is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Rouzer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I, too, want to
extend my condolences to the families and all those who were
injured in this very tragic happening.
General Graham, I will start with you. Last week, the Corps
announced it would reprogram appropriated dollars specific to
other Corps projects towards the efforts at Baltimore Harbor.
It is our understanding these funds were appropriated in fiscal
year 2020 or earlier, and have been determined to be more than
what is needed for those authorized projects. Is that an
accurate portrayal? Is that correct?
General Graham. That is accurate.
Mr. Rouzer. So, this has created a bit of confusion among
Members and even the committee here. Back home, for example, we
have got--the Wilmington District has seen several projects
whose funds have been repurposed. Notably, Wilmington Harbor,
Morehead City Harbor, and New River Inlet all had hundreds of
thousands of dollars redirected from their maintenance
accounts.
Can you provide the committee with the amount of
reprogrammed dollars, a list of the projects you are
reprogramming those funds from, and which districts those
projects are in?
General Graham. Absolutely.
Mr. Rouzer. Because we would greatly appreciate those
answers as quickly as possible.
And then the question everybody has got on their mind is:
How much money is sitting out there that is in an account that
was appropriated in 2020 or earlier that has been left unused?
I would like to know the answer to that question, too.
And then, following up, does the Corps plan to use section
101(a)(8) authority again in the future?
And if so, are there any limitations to the number of times
the Corps can utilize that authority within a specific
timeframe?
General Graham. Thank you, Congressman Rouzer. Probably we
will have to use the emergency reprogramming authority again.
As I stated in my opening statement, we have not used that
authority at this scale for 15 years, and we understand that
Congress put specific amounts of money on specific projects,
and you intended it to be used for those projects. From these
instances, as stated earlier, most of these funds were the
result of bid savings, they were the result of we held onto
additional money to settle claims with contractors. And so, it
is relatively a good-news story that we saved the taxpayers
money.
To your statement on our accounting procedures, do those
need to be looked at so that those old funds aren't sitting out
there? Absolutely, and we are committed to that.
Mr. Rouzer. Thank you. Following up, given these funds are
well on their way to being reprogrammed, does the Corps plan to
return any funds to those districts? What is your plan there?
And if so, what would that timeline be?
General Graham. To make sure I understand the question
correctly, the districts had no uses for these funds, and so,
as such, we don't plan to return them. If they come up with and
say we do need some of these, we will work with them to make
sure that those projects can be delivered.
Mr. Rouzer. Sure. Well, every district has a disaster of
some sort at some point, and I suspect that all those Army
Corps districts around the country like to be able to have a
little flexibility to tap into funding that was allocated
specific to projects within their jurisdiction, which is why I
asked that question.
And with that, Mr. Chairman, I think that exhausts my line
of questioning. I yield back.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. The gentleman of North Carolina
yields back. Mr. Carbajal is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I recently made a visit
to the Francis Scott Key Bridge incident with a number of my
colleagues to see it firsthand.
Admiral Gautier, the Coast Guard has an obligation to
respond to all marine casualties, but incidents of this size
have an outsized impact on Coast Guard resources. This
incident, unfortunately, comes at a time of strained resources
and a 10-percent workforce shortage. What is the operational
strain on the Coast Guard's responding to the bridge collapse,
and how can Congress help?
And what is the impact on the workforce?
Admiral Gautier. Congressman, we have mobilized people from
across the country. We have activated reservists to staff the
command post and to respond here. We have used cutters and
small boats from around the area, helicopters and so on, to do
this response. So, there is an immediate area impact to
readiness, certainly.
But what we know is that, for unplanned incidents like
this, where we mobilize a lot very quickly, there are also
readiness impacts that happen well beyond the initial site. And
so, I think, in terms of--and going into what is likely to be a
pretty severe hurricane season--I think the main thing here is
that, in order for the Coast Guard to reconstitute and be ready
for the next one, we need to have continued and enduring
financial appropriations support from Congress.
We spent about $20 million so far in direct and indirect
costs here, but we know that our readiness in the waterways
management field is brittle. We are short aids to navigation.
There is a cutter that is on-scene as the patrol commander that
is 62 years old, the Coast Guard cutter Sledge. We are working
to recapitalize that class of cutter and the waterways commerce
cutter, and this is repeated again and again in terms of
aircraft recapitalization, major cutter recapitalization
support for our people.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Admiral Gautier. The IMO ensures
minimum global standards for safe shipping practices. The U.S.-
flagged vessels are subject to higher standards and scrutiny.
This is one of the several reasons I believe it is unacceptable
that we rely on flag-of-convenience vessels to carry over 98
percent of our international cargo.
There is a small minority of my colleagues who believe that
the Jones Act should be repealed. I am not one of them. How
would your job of ensuring safety in U.S. waters be made more
difficult if U.S. vessels sailing in our coastal waterways and
inland rivers were supplanted by foreign ships with foreign
mariners?
Admiral Gautier. Congressman, your question is related to
safety and the Coast Guard implications of safety. The Jones
Act has been with us for 100 years. It is pretty foundational
to how maritime commerce flows in the United States, and the
Coast Guard has worked very hard to provide an equivalent level
of safety from foreign-flagged vessels, foreign crews, and IMO
through established standards.
But what I really can say here is that the Jones Act is
crucial for our maritime security elements, in terms of the
industrial shipbuilding capability in the United States of
America that the Coast Guard and that the Navy and MARAD and
others rely on in terms of construct--our U.S.-flagged military
and public vessels, as well. And we do not want in any way,
shape, or form to jeopardize that maritime security element of
the defense industrial complex through shipbuilding.
Mr. Carbajal. Chair Homendy, it is common practice for
American mariners working on U.S.-flagged ships to work on
board a vessel for 2 to 3 months at a time. Mariners sailing on
flag-of-convenience vessels often remain at sea for longer. In
the case of the Dali, I understand that the engineers have been
on board for more than 8 months.
Since your preliminary report showed at least one mistake
by the engineer, should we be concerned with the prevalence of
flag-of-convenience vessels, which operate with lower standards
operating in and around critical U.S. infrastructure?
Ms. Homendy. Well, we are still on-scene and evaluating
everything about this accident. We will look at any sort of
Federal regulations or IMO standards to make sure they are
adequate, but it is too early to tell.
Mr. Carbajal. What about the standards? If they abide by
lower standards, that shouldn't be of concern?
Ms. Homendy. I am not saying it is not a concern. I am
saying we have to evaluate with this particular accident, what
was in place and whether that was adequate or not.
Mr. Carbajal. But beyond this incident, is there a concern?
Ms. Homendy. I will have to get back to you on that for the
record.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Ms. Maloy [presiding]. The gentleman yields back. The Chair
recognizes Mr. Bost from Illinois for 5 minutes.
Mr. Bost. Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to associate
myself with the comments of concern for the families and the
prayers for a tragedy such as this, and also to thank the
people that responded so well and are doing the work.
But ensuring that our Nation's infrastructure is secure and
maintained is an important responsibility of our Congress, but
it is also important to have uniform guidelines in place to
know how infrastructure is going to be paid for.
Now, in my district, when local communities reach out for
assistance with grants to do road work, they know that local
cost share is at 20 percent. Now, just recently, my district
had a--on Highway U.S. 51, we had to close--and it is going to
be closed for quite some time--because a sinkhole opened up,
and the local community will need to repair the road, and there
will be a cost connected with that work. However, I don't
expect the community to try to redesignate the road to be
considered part of the Interstate Highway System to take care
of that.
Mr. Bhatt, despite being located on Interstate 695, the Key
Bridge was not part of the Interstate Highway System. The
incident that caused the collapse of the bridge occurred in
March, and yet the bridge designation wasn't applied to be
changed until April. Are you aware of any other--aware that--of
this change, cost share requirement for this road?
And is it normal for a road change to be designated after
an incident?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you for the question, Representative. This
is the first time I am aware of redesignating a road.
Mr. Bost. Me too. Me too. So, can you explain for the sake
of the taxpayers and the people around this country that also
have issues how a roadway has a designated change suddenly
after repair work was identified?
Because I can tell you the constituents that I represent
would like to try to figure out how to do that because that is
why we--look, I am just trying to figure it out because we have
uniform rules in place. And if we are going to change them, we
are the ones you come to. Just----
Mr. Bhatt [interposing]. Yes.
Mr. Bost. I need answers.
Mr. Bhatt. Yes. Sorry, Representative, I didn't mean to cut
you off there.
Yes, and apologies to the community that had the sinkhole.
I am sure that is quite an impactful event for that community.
In this case, this portion of I-695 was part of the NHS. It
was shielded as part of the interstate since it was built in
the 1970s. I think we--there was a--so, for mapping purposes,
it was part of it. There were some standards that were a little
bit different that, when they applied to have it designated, we
had to do the process of waivers, and that got it from the 80/
20 share to the 90/10 share. And so, I think our--I think my
assumption before this incident was that that bridge and that
section of I-695 was part of the interstate. So, this was just
at the request of Maryland to have it redesignated as part of
it.
And we get those requests. There are parts of the
interstate system that are shielded, but not necessarily part--
there was an example in Alabama a few years ago.
Mr. Bost. OK, and you do that just through administrative
rule, it doesn't require an act of Congress?
Mr. Bhatt. It does not. They would need to come in and say,
these are the design exceptions, whether it is the curves or
some of the other elements that they might have had in there,
and then our engineers would have to say, yes, this is why we
would approve those exceptions.
Mr. Bost. And you have got to understand the concerns of
uniformity. And I understand--believe me, I am not arguing
let's not fix it as fast as possible. I am not arguing that,
hey, whatever the cost is, as we are trying to recoup, as was
mentioned by several people questioning, insurance is not going
to pay off overnight. There are going to be arguments, there's
going to be all of that, and we are going to fight for that,
and we need to get it fixed quickly. It is just other
communities around the Nation have issues that come up, and not
having a set standard on how it is we respond and how we can
get a response back to our own communities makes it very
difficult when you do something that isn't normal in this
situation, and then we just have to have answers. So, I
appreciate that.
And with that, I will yield back.
Ms. Maloy. The gentleman yields back, and I recognize Mr.
Garcia for 5 minutes.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Madam Chair and Ranking
Member, for hosting this hearing, and thank you to all of the
witnesses.
I want to echo the sentiment of other Members who are
remembering the tragic loss of life of six workers, all of them
immigrants from Mexico and Central America, all of them seeking
a better life in this country, meeting a very tragic fate. So,
as we rebuild the Key Bridge, we must also advocate for
stronger workplace protections for all, including immigrant
workers, and this brings me to my first question.
Administrator Bhatt, the Coast Guard's testimony states
that eight construction workers were on the bridge at the time
of the collision, and that one worker was able to run to
safety. If there had been more time when the ship's loss of
power was reported and when the collision happened, is there a
protocol in place for bridge worker evacuation in an event such
as this collision? And if so, can you describe it?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Congressman, for the question and for
your concern for the workers.
Obviously, all work zones in America are dangerous places,
and we have rules in place for both the State or the city that
is procuring the contract and for the companies that are out
there.
I want to defer to others here, but what I learned through
our discussions is that there was a police officer who was
attempting to reach the work crew on the bridge to evacuate
them, but just given the proximity of the ship, was unable to
make it to the crew before the bridge strike.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Do you think the protocol is
adequate?
Mr. Bhatt. Sir, I would need to think about that and
consult with some of our experts. Obviously, this was an
unprecedented event, so, I just want to evaluate that and get
back to you for the record.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Chair Homendy?
Ms. Homendy. Yes. Other bridge structures, they have
advanced warning systems, and we will look at that as part of
our investigation.
But I will just say from the time the pilot's dispatcher
called MDTA police and the bridge was ordered closed was 52
seconds--52 seconds. That was the time of--it is almost
impossible, in that situation, to get a longer time. And if you
just look at the time from the blackout to the bridge strike,
it was 4 minutes total.
But I appreciate your question because it is really tragic,
what occurred. And we want to prevent that from reoccurring,
and that is our whole mission, which is why we will look at
advanced warning systems, as well.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. And thank you for that.
And Administrator Bhatt, if you could get back to me, it
would be greatly appreciated.
To Vice Admiral Gautier, the Dali had been inspected by the
Coast Guard about 6 months prior to the incident with the Key
Bridge. It is unusual that a major malfunction like this could
occur with no previous indication of faulty systems after being
cleared by an inspection only 6 months prior.
What are the requirements on foreign-flagged, foreign-owned
vessels to report any malfunctions to the Coast Guard when
operating at a U.S. port?
Admiral Gautier. The Coast Guard has a requirement for any
vessel that suffers an issue to notify on what we call a
reportable marine casualty, and there are a variety of
qualifications, sort of circumstances by which you have to
notify the Coast Guard of those casualties.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you much.
Lastly, very briefly to all of the panelists who would like
to chime in, although the NTSB investigation is ongoing and
recommendations are forthcoming, what is needed from Congress,
if anything, to improve worker safety?
Admiral Gautier. So, I will speak first. It is critically
important for us to have the fulsome results of the
investigation, I think, before we move ahead with any sorts of
implementations based on those recommendations.
I will say, so, the Coast Guard is conducting a Marine
Board of Investigation in coordination with NTSB in
cooperation. If we find something in the near term that we
think is important and urgent enough to do an advisory on, we
will go ahead and do that.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you.
Chair?
Ms. Homendy. Sir, this could happen in any of your
districts, right? And so, I would say where you have navigable
waterways, whoever is owning--I keep reiterating this. If you
own a bridge, if a State owns a bridge or other entity owns a
bridge, look at the current structure, do a risk assessment.
You can do that now. You don't have to wait until we issue an
urgent recommendation or come to the conclusion of our
investigation. Make sure you are ensuring safety for what is
going through on that bridge or in the navigable waterways now.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you.
I yield back, Madam Chair. Thank you for your indulgence.
Ms. Maloy. The gentleman yields back. The Chair recognizes
Mr. Westerman for 5 minutes.
Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to the
witnesses. And my first question is going to be for the Coast
Guard and the NTSB.
Obviously, everybody just about has offered their
condolences to the families of the people who lost their lives.
But I am thinking, if I were a family member, I would want more
than condolences. I would have questions that I wanted
answered. And the first question is, why?
I think, from the information that we have received so far,
the explanation would be we had vulnerable infrastructure, and
we had a ship that lost power. But I think there is a deeper
question as to why, and also, what are we going to do about
that so that it doesn't--we don't get a repeat incident?
If the ship had had a tug escort, would it have hit the
bridge even after it lost power?
Ms. Homendy. We are looking into that as part of our
investigation. I can't answer that right now. It is a question
that we have, but it is something we are delving into.
General Graham. The same for the Coast Guard. We don't know
whether there was sufficient time to have made a difference, or
whether it would have added to the casualty or not.
Mr. Westerman. I hope that is something that you are
looking into and looking at other places around the country
where these large ships are passing by vulnerable
infrastructure without tugs. I know Mr. Graves talked about the
ship in New Orleans, and from my understanding, all those ships
down there now have tug escorts.
Mr. Bhatt, you are here to discuss the need for a massive
bridge reconstruction that will require a years-long effort and
billions of dollars from the American taxpayer. Meanwhile,
those very taxpayers have been waiting for over 2 years for
FHWA to perform repairs to a washed-out gravel road on White
Rock Mountain in Franklin County, Arkansas, in my district.
This road provides access to Forest Service concessionaire
facilities, not to mention critical passage for emergency
services in the area. The project has already been funded, but
is apparently so tied up in redtape that my office can't even
get a clear answer from your agency on when the washout will be
filled.
If FHWA is unable to reconstruct a gravel road in less than
2 years and counting, why should we trust your agency with
billions in funding for a project of this magnitude?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Congressman. I am happy to go back
and take a look and figure out exactly what is going on with
that project and report back to your office.
Mr. Westerman. Thank you. And this, I guess, would be for
the Corps and for Mr. Bhatt, but there is an issue that
happened in Floyd Bennett Field, which is a National Park
Service facility in New York City. And you may ask, what in the
world does that have to do with this project, but I will tell
you what it has to do.
This administration used alternative arrangements to waive
every NEPA and environmental regulation in the Park Service to
build a migrant camp, and they did that in less than 2 weeks.
They waived all those regulations. I am wondering if the
administration has the intent to use alternative arrangements,
not just CEs but alternative arrangements, to repair this
bridge, which is obviously very vital infrastructure.
Mr. Bhatt. Sir, so, we are in close coordination with
Maryland DOT. We are not going to waive NEPA, but is a strong
likelihood that we will end up with a categorical exclusion
because we are replacing a bridge in relatively the same
footprint that existed before.
Mr. Westerman. Does the administration have the legal
authority to waive NEPA to use alternative arrangements to even
go beyond the CE?
Mr. Bhatt. Sir, I----
Mr. Westerman [interrupting]. The answer is yes, and they
can do that, and it is amazing to me that they would do it on a
Park Service facility that 1 million visitors in New York City
use to build a migrant camp. Yet, it doesn't seem to be an
option on the table to rebuild this vital piece of
infrastructure. And I hope the administration would not only
afford this same luxury to critical infrastructure, but also to
a lot of smaller projects around the country that get tied up
in the process when the administration has full authority to do
that.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and I yield back.
Ms. Maloy. The gentleman yields back. I recognize Mr.
Stanton for 5 minutes for questions.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you to each of
the witnesses for your hard work in responding to this critical
emergency in our country. And like every member of this
committee, I do send my deepest condolences to the families of
the six human beings, the workers who lost their lives as a
result of this tragic incident.
When the Dali crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in
Maryland, we saw the agencies represented here today jump into
action. But the road to rebuild is long, and it requires
coordination between our local, State, and Federal Governments.
As a former mayor myself, I understand how critical
intergovernmental cooperation is for efficiency and speedy
results.
Administrator Bhatt, to my understanding, one of the ways
the Federal Highway Administration responded to the disaster
was by reclassifying the bridge as an interstate. Tell us more
about the purpose of that reclassification. And how will that
help with speedy bridge repair?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you for the question, Congressman.
We received a request from Maryland DOT shortly after the
bridge disaster to reclassify. And so, we went through the
usual process that we would do for any State DOT that was
asking to come in. I think our assumption had been that it was
part of the interstate, since it was shielded and was on maps
that way.
Just going back, the difference will be that, instead of
being part of the NHS, it is now officially part of the
interstate, and goes from an 80/20 cost share to a 90/10.
Mr. Stanton. That's great. Another important action taken
at the outset of the disaster was the quick release of
Emergency Relief Program funds, a reimbursable program. I
understand it was $60 million that was released in March. That
is a sizable amount. How was that $60 million number decided?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Congressman. So, we have been in
close contact with Maryland DOT from the early hours.
Specifically, I think this is a great example of the quick
release funding being put to work. They actually had a
contractor who could mobilize very quickly, had cranes in the
area. And while the Army Corps was focused on the navigable
channel, that $60 million is helping to clear wreckage
simultaneously from the nonnavigable waterways.
Mr. Stanton. Obviously, the cost will be significant above
and beyond the initial amount. Tell us the role that the
Emergency Relief Program will play in additional funds for
bridge repair and any other Federal highway programs that will
likely need to be utilized in this important work.
Mr. Bhatt. Yes. And so, as some of the--thank you,
Congressman--for some of the questions that have come in, the
first 270 days, the emergency repair work is funded at 100. And
then longer term, permanent repair work is funded at 90/10.
Traditionally through this program, the initial estimate is
around $1.7 to $1.9 billion for the bridge. It will be a 4-year
construction. And that is that critical piece where Maryland
will have the certainty that that Federal funding will be
available so that they can move forward with their procurement.
Mr. Stanton. That's great. Lastly, it is my understanding
that one of the primary roles of the Federal Highway
Administration currently is to also give technical assistance
to the Maryland Department of Transportation. Is there anything
you can share with us today regarding those conversations as
the Federal partners to Maryland DOT?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you. And Congressman, I do want to
recognize our Federal Highway staff that have been on site and
in close coordination both in Maryland and in headquarters.
So, we are meeting with them on the emergency work, on
getting the ER funding on the procurement, on the elements of
the bridge design that are going to be out there. So, it is a
really strong partnership that exists.
Mr. Stanton. We appreciate the work of yourself, FHWA, all
the other agencies represented today. It is critical that we
get the bridge rebuilt as soon as possible not only for the
city of Baltimore, the State of Maryland, but the entire
economy of the United States of America. So, thank you for your
work you have already done and the work you will do on this
important, important project.
Thank you, I yield back.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentleman yields back, and I
recognize Mr. Mast for 5 minutes for questions.
Mr. Mast. Thank you, Chairwoman. Thank you all for your
testimony.
Mr. Bhatt, would this be an accurate way to categorize you?
You are in charge of collecting the checks for the future
project?
Mr. Bhatt. Sorry, I am in charge of collecting checks for
the future project?
Mr. Mast. Money. You are in charge of getting the money for
the project.
Mr. Bhatt. Yes.
Mr. Mast. OK. Have you received any money from any insurer
yet?
Mr. Bhatt. No, sir.
Mr. Mast. Which insurers have you sought moneys from?
Mr. Bhatt. So, to be clear, the insurance policy that we
are talking about is an insurance policy for the Maryland
Department of Transportation. And so, we are working with
Maryland DOT to work through the elements of that insurance
policy.
Mr. Mast. Nothing for any insurance company of Grace Ocean
Private, Ltd.?
Mr. Bhatt. So, the Department of Justice is leading efforts
around the--for the efforts for the United States to recover
the funds. So, that is not a Federal Highway function.
Mr. Mast. Nothing also for you in terms of requesting
anything from insurers of Maersk who chartered that vessel from
Grace?
Mr. Bhatt. No, sir. The Federal Highway Administration role
in this is the debris removal in the nonnavigable waterway, and
then working with Maryland DOT to rebuild the bridge. We will
take back any insurance funds that come in and reimburse the ER
Program.
Mr. Mast. What has Department of Justice told you to this
point about--have they requested moneys from any of those
insurers or any other companies?
Mr. Bhatt. Sir, I would not be able to comment on
Department of Justice efforts. I know they are working on it, I
just--I am not aware.
Mr. Mast. So, they haven't had any contact with you about
requesting moneys. You can comment about your involvement, your
conversation with them, not necessarily what they have done.
Mr. Bhatt. Specifically, sir, the only email that I have
received is from DOJ to preserve all of my emails for upcoming
and likely years-long litigation.
Mr. Mast. Why is it likely years-long litigation?
Mr. Bhatt. Again, sir, I can only speak to my efforts
around bridge building and litigation that occurs when there
are claims between a contractor and a State, where they don't
feel that the product meets--that can take years, so, billions
of dollars and international maritime law, I can only assume,
will be a fairly lengthy process.
Mr. Mast. None of us are naive enough to say that insurance
companies just readily come out and offer us large payouts for
things that are insured. I would be naive to say that, it is
just not the state of the world. But in the midst of this
catastrophe, I guess it is a great word to categorize it.
Have you seen anything or heard anything from DOJ about
these insurance companies offering anything or trying to say
that they do not have liability for this?
Mr. Bhatt. Sir, to be--I would need to come back to you. I
would have to check with our chief counsel, our general counsel
at DOT and other agencies. But I am happy to come back on that
question.
Mr. Mast. I appreciate that. Have you heard anything about
whether they have already executed any type of business
interruption insurance for the vessel that is not in use right
now?
Mr. Bhatt. Sir, I am not aware of that.
Mr. Mast. OK. And a lot of these questions, again, I
appreciate you listening to. You don't have the answers for
them.
Madam Chairwoman, I would encourage this committee to get
some of the other entities in here, since we are talking
significantly across both sides of the aisle about the funding
for this bridge, the timing for it, the repairs of this bridge,
things peripheral to that, that we bring in the insurance
companies for conversation, the shipping companies for
conversation about this, as well. And I would hope that we
would do that in the next--maybe next week that we are in
session.
But it is certainly sensical that we speak to you all about
this, but it is also sensical that we speak to the private
entities that are involved in this, as well. I thank you for
your testimony.
I thank you for the time, and I yield back.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentleman yields back, and I now
recognize Mrs. Foushee for 5 minutes for questioning.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you, and thank you to the chairs for
holding this hearing, and thank you to the witnesses for being
here with us today.
The tragic events that took place in the early morning
hours of Tuesday, March 26 were a tragedy not simply for
Baltimore or Maryland, but for the Nation. I join my colleagues
in mourning the six lives lost in this catastrophic accident.
While I have been heartened by the response of the
Baltimore community who have, at last count, already fundraised
over half a million dollars to support the families of the Key
Bridge victims, it is the responsibility of both the Federal
Government and the private sector to ensure something like this
never happens again, which is, at least in part, why we are
here today.
The Biden administration, the State of Maryland, the Coast
Guard, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, among others, have
taken commendable initiative and swift action in responding to
this crisis, something that has been highlighted by the
witnesses here today. I want to thank all of you for being
here. I know your time is valuable, especially in the midst of
an ongoing situation like this, so, my colleagues and I, we
greatly appreciate your time and your testimonies.
I think most of us on this committee understand that this
matter is going to require expeditious, bipartisan support here
in Congress if we wish to mitigate. At best, we can get to the
economic and the supply chain ripple effects of the FSK Bridge
collapse. However, I believe it is worth noting that there are
also some significant road safety implications here, as well as
even further that underscore this need for congressional
support.
With the port no longer at full capacity, commercial trucks
are being forced to take roads through residential areas that
aren't equipped for that kind of traffic. Chairwoman Homendy
and Administrator Bhatt, can either of you speak to the traffic
safety issues to other vehicles on the roads, to pedestrians,
or to the residential road infrastructure that have either
already emerged as a result of the FSK Bridge closure or are at
risk of emerging, should access to the port remain limited?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Congresswoman. Obviously, there is
a--thank you for noting the traffic impacts.
I would just, in the interest of time, I would highlight
the hazmat traffic that--the hazmat materials are not allowed
in the tunnels through Baltimore. And so, that was one of the
critical elements of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, was to
provide hazmat material to move around. And now what is
happening is they are rerouting around the north side of 695.
It goes through neighborhoods, and it is suboptimal from a
routing perspective. So, that is just one example.
And then, obviously, as you mentioned, there are trucks and
other commercial vehicles and just higher levels of traffic
working their way through residential areas now, as well.
Ms. Homendy. This is an issue that I would typically defer
to Federal Highways, just because we are just focused on the
investigation itself. So, thank you.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you.
I, like many of my colleagues, have been particularly
concerned about the regional implications on unemployment that
the bridge collapse and reduction of port operations are having
on the surrounding community, as the State of Maryland has
estimated that 270,000 jobs will ultimately be impacted.
Even so, I have been especially encouraged by the efforts
thus far of the Biden administration to support the plethora of
temporarily displaced workers who have had their employment
either directly or indirectly impacted since the events of
March 26. For instance, the administration funneled an initial
tranche of $3.5 million to the region via its Dislocated Worker
Grant program back in April to support temporary cleanup and
recovery employment opportunities for those who have lost their
jobs due to the FSK Bridge incident, with more support funds on
the way.
Vice Admiral Gautier and Major General Graham, can you
speak to the efforts of the U.S. Coast Guard and the Army
Corps, respectively, about the ongoing efforts to restore
services and access to the port, given the widespread
ramifications such efforts will have on employment in the
region?
Admiral Gautier. Well, let me go first, because I want to
do a shout out to the Army Corps of Engineers. Commerce is
flowing. The depth of the channel has been restored to 48 of 50
feet. It is narrower than what it typically is, but it is
sufficient for Coast Guard to put one-way vessel and tug escort
controls to get traffic in and out.
And so, we have seen over 20--over 35 deep-draft vessels
that have transited, over 300 smaller barges and other things
that have been able to transit in and out. And so, I think what
we are seeing is that the system is restoring itself to normal
functions while we work together in Unified Command to make
sure the full channel width and depth is restored.
General Graham. And ma'am, I am working with the port in
the State of Maryland to open up as many alternate channels as
we could, small craft, and we successfully got to larger and
larger craft. As Vice Admiral Gautier said, we were able to get
a 35---now about 40-, 48-foot channel to get those key car
carriers moving. And we remain committed to getting the full
channel open by the end of this month.
Mrs. Foushee. Madam Chair, that is my time. I yield back.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentlelady yields back, and I
recognize Mr. Yakym for 5 minutes of questions.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Madam Chair.
I, too, want to offer my condolences to the families who
lost loved ones in this disaster, and I want to thank our
witnesses not just for being here, but also for the tireless
work that you and your agencies have done in putting into the
recovery efforts, and also the investigative matters that you
have undertaken as we look into this disaster even deeper. So,
thank you.
Before I get to my questions about the topic at hand,
Administrator Bhatt, I feel the need to follow up on a
conversation we had in December when you were before this
committee. You may recall that we discussed the NEVI and the
CFI programs, which have a combined $7\1/2\ billion at their
disposal to build electric vehicle charging stations. As of the
December hearing, NEVI had brought just one charging station
online in 2 years. I asked you how many charging stations you
expected those programs would bring online in 2024, and you
promised to follow up with a ``very specific number.''
But in March, you sent a response that contained no
specific number, and you noted that hundreds of millions of
dollars had gone out the door to build 7,500 ports, but there
was no indication as to how many, if any, of those would be
brought online this year. And thus far in 2024, NEVI has been
responsible for six charging stations--again, with roughly
$7\1/2\ billion at its disposal--and there doesn't appear to be
any public information for the completed CFI chargers.
Administrator Bhatt, I want to give you one more chance
here. How many more NEVI- and CFI-funded charging stations do
you expect to be brought online for this year?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Representative, and thank you for the
followup.
So, we are working closely with our State DOT partners and
cities across the Nation. We are also working closely with the
joint office that has been set up between Department of Energy
and Department of Transportation. Since that time, there have
been several States that have brought online NEVI chargers.
That has been in Vermont, Ohio, Kentucky. Utah is going to have
their first. So, there are dozens, and I will get you the
specific number, but dozens that we are anticipating coming
online just in the next couple of months. Thirty-five of those
States have their solicitations out.
And then specifically on CFI, on January 5, we rolled out
$623 million in grants in January for CFI nationwide. And those
will--we are working with grant agreements now to get those
built this year.
Mr. Yakym. So, again, how many--just give me--how many do
you think will be brought online this year total, just to give
a ballpark number?
Mr. Bhatt. Probably in the hundreds to in the thousands
range this year.
And again, I want to differentiate between DFC chargers and
the level 2 chargers that are obviously replacing ones that are
existing on the network.
Mr. Yakym. OK. Yes, well, thank you for that. And I do want
to make sure that we, as we go throughout the balance of the
year, we stay in touch on this particular topic, as we--again,
we have allocated $7\1/2\ billion. And we are, as of just a few
months ago--a month ago, we were at eight total chargers. And
we want to make sure that the money that has been appropriated
by this Congress is spent wisely.
Turning our attention to the Key Bridge, Administrator
Bhatt, I want to build on what Mr. Bost talked about with his
redesignation of the bridge as an interstate system. I share
his sentiments that we should get this bridge rebuilt quickly,
but I believe we should also be mindful of new precedents that
we set and establish as we go through this whole process.
You mentioned that part of an Alabama highway was
redesignated as a part of the interstate system. How long did
that process take from application to approval?
Mr. Bhatt. This was back in--sir, I would have to go back
to you on the exact dates, but probably a few weeks.
And actually, to be clear, I think that was changing the
main line of the interstate with the bypass. So, maybe not
exactly apples and apples.
Mr. Yakym. Maryland's request to redesignate this as an
interstate was made after the collapse. Is that correct?
Mr. Bhatt. Yes.
Mr. Yakym. Does your agency have the authority to
retroactively designate damaged or destroyed infrastructure as
a part of the interstate system?
Mr. Bhatt. Sir, I would have to clarify on our exact
authority and the retroactive piece. I just know that we
received the request after the incident, and we went through
our typical process and designated it as part of the
interstate.
Mr. Yakym. Is there any precedent for retroactively
designating damaged or destroyed infrastructure as a part of
the interstate system?
Mr. Bhatt. Sir, I would have to come back to you on that. I
am not aware.
Mr. Yakym. Yes, I would very much like to know if your
agency was within its authority to retroactively designate this
as an interstate, as opposed to its former designation as a
part of the State highway system. So, thank you.
And with that, Madam Chair, I yield back.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentleman yields back, and I
recognize Mr. DeSaulnier----
Mr. DeSaulnier [interposing]. Thank you.
Ms. Maloy [continuing]. For 5 minutes for questions.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to
all the witnesses. Just a horrible event.
Ms. Homendy or all of you, but--I want to direct this
question to you. In 2007, near the district I represent in the
bay area, there was a similar incident with the San Francisco
Bay Bridge. It is the second busiest toll bridge after the
George Washington Bridge in the United States, but it is the
terminus of Interstate 80. So, what happened there was the
fender system--and California had gone further--kept the bridge
from being damaged, but it still had to be shut down so that
you and Caltrans could go through and make sure it was safe.
Plus, it is seismically vulnerable.
So, what do we do in cases like that in 2007, where we--
lessons learned are looked at and, sort of consistent with some
of the other questions, irrespective of whether it is part of
the Federal highway system, and just making sure that State
departments of transportation, that they know what the best
practices are for their area?
Ms. Homendy. Well, for our role as part of an investigation
agency, we continue to share lessons learned as part of any
investigation, including with State departments of
transportation. Certainly, we have conducted a number of
investigations involving vessel strikes on bridges, and have
shared those lessons learned and continue to do so, and to
continue to advocate even for recommendations that have been
``closed, unacceptable.''
But I will say that the Federal Highway Administration also
has close contact, where they're State partners, to continue to
highlight safety issues and risk assessment, as well.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Yes, Vice Admiral, this happened very close
to your admiral's--the regional--his home was beautiful on
Treasure Island. But in that instance also they were required
to have bar pilots come in. So, it is the--Oakland is the
fourth busiest port in the United States, a lot of traffic goes
through there. But again, we have got lots of bridges, and the
Bay Bridge closest to it. So, a lot of the operations of that
port, they work closely with the Coast Guard to make sure that
the management of the transportation system works, and it works
properly in terms of the whole transportation system. So, in
this case, a heavily traveled bridge.
How does your Department and the Coast Guard coordinate--
again, on your experience--around the world on how to make sure
that these structures that are run by State transportation
agencies, particularly if they are not part of the interstate,
has the best information about the dangers of marine traffic,
commercial marine traffic?
Admiral Gautier. Yes, thank you, Congressman. I am familiar
with the Cosco Busan incident that you are referring to----
Mr. DeSaulnier [interposing]. Right.
Admiral Gautier [continuing]. Many years of operations
there in the bay area.
So, we are doing a Marine Board of Investigation, just like
we did in the Cosco Busan. We do an investigation of findings
of fact, and then we recommend and take remedial actions based
on that. But I think what we are talking about here is a little
bit different in terms of the system as you have mentioned it.
And so, the Coast Guard does have a set of tools, risk
management tools, that we get together with stakeholders in any
given port to evaluate the totality of the risk if something
changes, like if a channel becomes deeper or if a new bridge
gets built, and so on. One comes to mind as a port and
waterways risk assessment. One was done in Baltimore, but not
since 2001.
So, as a result of this incident, the Coast Guard is
initiating a board of inquiry under my signature, which will
look at how the Coast Guard does these assessments, how recent
they are in the ports around the country, and to examine the
top 10 ports for some lessons learned, including bridge, bridge
fendering systems, hazards to navigation, and so on, together
with stakeholders so we can draw some conclusions, and then
move out with a refined toolkit to other ports around the
country.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Coming back to Ms. Homendy, part of just
the most recent report about human error on the boat reminds me
of some of our discussions about the aviation industry. There
is a lot of pressure on these companies to move product and
show a profit. Are you concerned the same thing, that we are
not providing enough oversight to the people who are running
the ships in the system, and they are being overworked, so,
they are missing things, whether it is people who are mechanics
repairing the ships or people who are operating the ships?
Ms. Homendy. Well, with respect to what occurred in port on
March 25, there was routine maintenance going on on the vessel.
And it was not something that stood out to us as--I mean, there
is human error in everything we do, routine maintenance and,
too, if we are working on our cars in our garage. Sometimes we
make mistakes. In this case, a damper was closed and an engine
failed. So, in these situations, the crew took action to get
everything back up and running, and on the next day, they were
on a different set of breakers and a different transformer.
So, we will look at that as part of the investigation,
including any sort of human error that occurred on the 25th or
the 26th.
Mr. DeSaulnier. And I wasn't inferring a blame on the
crew's part, just the pressure on the company to make profits.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentleman yields, and I recognize
Mr. LaMalfa for 5 minutes for questions.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I appreciate
panelists coming here today. I have been looking forward to
this hearing on this topic here. We have a lot of bridge
history in this country, especially in recent years, and
expediting the reconstruction of this is critical, I am
certain, to Baltimore and the eastern seaboard, as it would be
in any area of the country with an artery like that.
So, what I am especially interested in is what is being
done--and anybody on the panel that wants to weigh in--to truly
expedite this process. Because when I--when you read about it,
when you get information about it, it sounds like there is a
lot of preliminaries that are, of course, necessary with the
demolition of the old bridge and such.
But where I get frustrated is a bog down of studies and
NEPA and things of that nature with an already existing
structure. This is not a pristine area. And so, what is being
done to make a concurrent effort to do that stuff and get
categorical exclusions, but also at the same time be moving
forward as quickly as possible?
And some examples I have of successes, as just Mr.
DeSaulnier alluded to in California now, there was the Bay
Bridge 1989 earthquake during the World Series, you may
remember, where about a 250-ton chunk of that collapsed. And I
am not sure how quickly they got that put back up, but it
wasn't terribly long when they put their minds to it.
On the obverse side of that coin, you have the actual
replacement of the Bay Bridge took 24 years. In 1989, when you
decided there was a problem with the bridge--it was decided--it
wasn't completed until 2013. They started construction in 2002
and completed it in 2013. So, that is an 11-year actual
construction time, but a 24-year decision to actually--and to
completion.
The 1994 Northridge earthquake knocked down significant
chunks of freeway in southern California, and the initial
estimates, I believe at the time, by Caltrans or others was
like, oh, this is going to take 3 years, which would just put a
giant crimp in movement and commerce in southern California.
So, the State and the Governor, Governor Wilson, put out a call
for shortening that timeline from basically 3 years to 140
days. And one of the people involved was this company called
C.C. Myers Construction Company. They got it done not just in
140 days, but 66 days, with a large incentive, a large bonus
possible.
So, on one hand--and then the MacArthur Maze in Oakland
during--not my time here, but there was a problem there. I
believe that was the fire. Anyway, they got that done in 27
days with a bonus involved, as well, with the C.C. Myers
Company. Unfortunately, they are out of business now. Mr. Myers
passed.
So, what can be done as far as incentives to actually speed
up the process and not take 6 years of paralysis of Baltimore,
but set aside bureaucracy and get it done in 3, let's say, OK?
I mean realistically. So, anybody on the panel.
Mr. Bhatt. So, Congressman, just--and thank you for your
question and your examples that you have provided.
I would just say that we share your desire to reopen the
bridge as quickly as possible. I would say that Federal
Highways worked with Maryland to get a programmatic CE for the
debris removal in April so that they weren't waiting around for
an approval to get the debris out of the channel. And we are
working. They are going to issue their RFP later this month,
hopefully get somebody under contract by August, which is
within 5 months of the incident, and we will hopefully be able
to get them to a categorical exclusion. And they are looking at
4 years of construction.
So, the plan right now is for that bridge to be reopened in
2028, which--I don't know that there is any other authority
that we could exert to get that done any faster.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK, thank you.
Currently, the movement of goods and commerce is very
important. So, is there anybody--I mean, Ms. Homendy or
others--a look at maybe providing a waiver for trucker hours?
Because they are going to have to face 2 or 3 hours of delays.
Is there a way that a trucker's hours can be--have flexibility
for time of duty on that, as well as the ability to use the
tunnels there for--ordinarily what trucks wouldn't be allowed
to do.
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, sir. That would actually be under
U.S. Department of Transportation and FMCSA working with the
State. They can make waiver requests for truck weight and
also--I am not sure on the trucker hours. I will be happy to
get back to you for the service hours, but certainly----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Yes, please look into that. If
locals are saying that would be helpful in order to complete--
you wouldn't want to run out by 2 hours or something with what
the initial delay would be.
But also, is there an issue of the tunnel being available
to all types of trucking and others, restrictions on certain
types of trucking that could be helpful? Could you have a
waiver on maybe hazardous materials, having a certain time of
day that they could access it, for example, that maybe they
can't otherwise?
I am just looking for ways for flexibility. That is what I
would be asking. Would those be possible thoughts, do you
think?
[Pause.]
Ms. Maloy. The gentleman's time has expired.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK, thank you. Can he answer that?
Ms. Maloy. Yes, quickly.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you.
Mr. Bhatt. I am happy to follow up with your office, sir,
on those questions.
Mr. LaMalfa. All right, thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentleman yields back, and I
recognize Mrs. Sykes for 5 minutes for questions.
Mrs. Sykes. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to
Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen for convening this
full committee hearing today.
And to our witnesses, thank you for your testimony and for
working diligently to respond to the tragedy that struck the
Francis Scott Key Bridge in March.
And I join my colleagues in expressing my sympathy to the
families who lost loved ones and lives, as well as the greater
Baltimore and Maryland community.
Coming from Ohio, this is really important. We have the
Nation's second highest number of bridges, and this is a very
important conversation for us. And even just last week, we
presented two checks to our county engineer and county
executive for nearly $10 million to replace a decommissioned
over-70-year-old bridge that was identified as critical
infrastructure. So, bridge security and safety is very
important to us in Ohio's 13th district and across the State of
Ohio.
But I want to highlight something different. Less than 2
months after this disaster struck in Maryland, the majority on
this committee was able to organize and hold a very timely and
necessary hearing on the incident. And this hearing and the
witnesses today are a perfect example of Federal Government
fulfilling its role to support State and local efforts from
disasters with Federal dollars and resources when they are
needed most. This partnership between governing bodies is what
I hoped to see more of when I was elected to Congress 2 years
ago.
So, you all can understand my disappointment when, in the
over a year since the train derailment devastated the community
of East Palestine and its way of life, the majority on this
committee has not shown the same sense of urgency and has yet
to notice a hearing to discuss the state of rail safety in
Ohio. What about the people of Ohio and East Palestine who have
been begging us--this question is to the majority--who have
been begging us to do something on rail safety?
And even on the Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and
Hazardous Materials, the subcommittee would not hold a hearing
to discuss the Norfolk Southern train derailment or the broader
issue of rail safety, leaving Democrats to host a rail safety
roundtable without Members of the majority present.
And while I don't represent East Palestine geographically,
I am the only Ohioan on this committee, and East Palestine does
not currently have a Member of the United States House of
Representatives serving in Congress. So, I have no problem
speaking up for my neighbors to the east of me.
And since the derailment in East Palestine, two additional
trains have derailed in Ohio alone, and many others across the
country. And the communities, local and State, are still
burdened with contaminated local waterways and some airways
across the Nation.
Even more recently, on March 2 of this year, three trains
crashed and derailed in eastern Pennsylvania, leaving at least
seven crewmembers injured, with the estimated damages to the
equipment and track to be about $2.5 million. Emergency
personnel responding to the scene found diesel fuel had spilled
from one of the train cars, but containment booms were deployed
to clean up the spill before the situation worsened. It was by
luck that a derailment of those three trains was not worse, or
anything like we saw in eastern Ohio.
It is very clear that the issue of train derailments is not
going away, and turning a blind eye to the issue is clearly not
the path that Congress or this committee should take. Americans
across the political spectrum, including the former President,
the Biden-Harris administration all agree we must pass
commonsense rail safety legislation to prevent future train
derailments and keep our community safe.
I am proud that Ohio Democrats and Republicans came
together to introduce the bipartisan RAIL Act last year, and
now it is time for the House Republican majority to pass the
RAIL Act to protect Ohioans and communities across the country.
The RAIL Act would implement effective measures to keep our
communities safe, hold railroad corporations accountable, and
ensure that no American living close to our 140,000 miles of
railroad track has to worry about the threat of a toxic train
derailment in their backyard.
Finally, I would like to take a moment to recognize the
administration, our State and local partners in the State of
Ohio, and public servants who are continuously uplifting East
Palestine, even though this committee and the United States
House of Representatives has turned a blind eye and turned
their back to the people of Ohio.
And I would also like to take a moment to recognize Ms.
Homendy and thank her and the rest of the National
Transportation Safety Board for their investigation into the
cause of the Norfolk Southern train derailment, and their work
in investigating other accidents across the country with, no
doubt, fewer people than you need.
You have continued to fill in the gap where Congress has
refused to act, holding hearings and townhalls with residents
in East Palestine, providing preliminary information that we
could act upon, and a sense that people in the administration
and the Federal Government do care about them, even if this
committee and this Congress has refused to. I look forward to
reviewing the Board's findings and hopefully considering their
recommendations as we look to rail safety in America. And thank
you again for filling in the gaps where this committee has
failed the people of East Palestine.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Ms. Maloy. The gentlelady yields back, and I recognize Mr.
Burlison for 5 minutes for questions.
Mr. Burlison. Thank you.
Ms. Homendy, it was just mentioned about the derailment in
East Palestine, and we have had some other derailments that
have made the news. But overall, would it not be accurate to
say that trains and that--ultimately, they are more safe? It is
probably the safest mode of transportation for goods and
services, goods to be transported.
Ms. Homendy. For transportation, over 40,000 people are
dying on our Nation's roads. So, as far as transporting goods
and people, rail is incredibly safe. It doesn't mean that a
tragedy doesn't occur, and that is where we come in and
investigate.
Mr. Burlison. OK, so, I think it would be dangerous if we
started trying to steer activity more away from rail because of
these events. How many people died in East----
Ms. Homendy [interrupting]. I would like more things to go
on rail.
Mr. Burlison. Right. How many people died in East
Palestine?
Ms. Homendy. No one died in East Palestine.
Mr. Burlison. I think it is important to note that. While
it might have been an environmental hazard, I think it is
important to recognize the actual numbers.
Mr. Barrett--or is it Barat--or Bhatt, sorry, Mr. Bhatt. My
question has to do with the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which has
been the subject for this entire hearing. As I understand,
there are about 15,000 jobs that are dependent on the port and
another 140,000 that are linked to the port. Many of the
individuals are worried that they could lose their jobs because
of no longer having access because of the collapse of the
bridge. How long will it take to construct the new bridge?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Congressman, for the question. And
yes, the port--and I think that is part of the critical efforts
of the Army Corps and the Coast Guard to get that port reopened
so that those jobs can resume. I think the bridge itself, once
the port reopens, is on a 2028 schedule right now is the
preliminary estimate to get that bridge back open.
Mr. Burlison. So, a 4-year estimate. What about the cost
for the bridge?
Mr. Bhatt. So, right now, the way that the RFP is being
structured, it will be a progressive design-build. So, you go
in and you say, ``This is the structure that we need to
build,'' and then the benefits of progressive design-build is
they can bring in different elements. So, that is why the cost
and the schedule will update as the different elements come in.
But right now it is estimated at $1.7 to $1.9 billion.
Mr. Burlison. Have there been any environmental concerns or
any other issues that we might be able to look to sign any
waivers that might expedite the construction of the bridge?
Mr. Bhatt. Yes. So, on the environmental side, and through
NEPA, that is why we are likely going to get to a categorical
exclusion, because we are putting a bridge back where one
existed relatively within the same footprint. We will work with
our permitting agencies to make sure that we are not missing
anything, but that is our plan.
Mr. Burlison. And you served as the head of transportation
for the State of Colorado prior to this role. Is that correct?
Mr. Bhatt. And Delaware.
Mr. Burlison. OK. And so, in that role, what is your
experience? I know we just had the--a new rule that--or
Executive order that was put in place under this administration
that requires project labor agreements for anything, I think it
is, above $35 million. Is that the cost?
Mr. Bhatt. I would have to come back on the exact numbers.
Mr. Burlison. So, in your experience in--on both the State
level and the Federal level, do requiring project labor
agreements improve the timeline of projects?
Mr. Bhatt. Sir, I would need to come back to you with
specific examples on the timeline and the----
Mr. Burlison [interrupting]. What about the costs?
Mr. Bhatt. Again, sir, I don't want to speculate. I want to
come back with specific data.
Mr. Burlison. And I am not trying to press on you. We had a
great conversation before. But surely, you have enough years of
experience to understand the distinction and the difference
between the costs of a project, whether or not a project labor
agreement is required.
Mr. Bhatt. Yes. The one project I would think about--and it
wasn't a PLA that was required, but we did do what I would call
the first sort of local hiring preference in Denver when we
replaced the I-70 viaduct. And the goal is--and I think it is
similar to where the administration is here--is trying to
create good-paying jobs and create a workforce for the future
and ensure that we are building the Nation's infrastructure and
building out great jobs----
Mr. Burlison [interrupting]. But if the taxpayer were going
to get more bang for their buck, if they are going to get more
bridges, more roads, it would be without a project labor
agreement.
Mr. Bhatt. Again, sir, I want to come back to you with the
specific data on that.
Mr. Burlison. I think the answer is yes.
Thank you, my time is expired.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentleman yields back, and I
recognize Mr. Menendez for 5 minutes for questions.
Mr. Menendez. Thank you, Madam Chair.
And just quickly following up, I had the opportunity to
visit the Portal North Bridge, which runs through New Jersey, a
critically important part of the Gateway Program, to mark the
50-percent completion of the project. It is largely being built
by labor. It is on time and on budget. So, I thank my friends
in labor for the incredible work that they do to continue to
develop and build our critical infrastructure.
I want to thank all of our witnesses today for their
testimony, their ongoing work regarding the Francis Scott Key
Bridge collapse.
I want to join my colleagues in recognizing the six workers
who lost their lives during this tragic accident, immigrants
who are making not just our infrastructure stronger, but our
Nation stronger. My thoughts are with their families and the
communities that they were a part of.
New Jersey's Eighth Congressional District is home to the
largest port on the east coast. Following the collapse of the
Key Bridge, the Port of New York and New Jersey was ready to
accommodate additional vessels to ensure our supply chain
remained intact. This is thanks in large part to the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey, their dedicated teams,
the operators of our ports, and the incredible men and women of
ILA who keep our region moving.
Administrator Bhatt, your testimony notes that the Federal
Highway Administration will work to ensure that the new bridge
is built to current design standards. Can you describe how
design standards have changed since the Key Bridge was built in
1977 and the challenges posed by increasingly large vessels
calling at our ports?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you Congressman, for the question.
I think just--if you look at the bridge, it was a truss
bridge, and they are very strong and made of steel. And that
was the prevailing design at that time. When you look at many
of the truss bridges that are being replaced today, they are
being replaced by cable-stayed bridges, for the most part.
There are a lot of advantages from cost, strength. You can
precast the concrete sections, bring them into place. And so, I
think that is probably the likely design that will come
forward.
With regard to design standards, obviously, there is
vertical load and lateral load that we have to account for. And
then I think specifically what the Francis Scott Key Bridge has
brought forward, and what we are going to be working very
closely with Chair Homendy--and I echo her call to any bridge
owner to begin examining their bridges right now--is what is
the appropriate level of protection that we need to design so
that we don't have another similar situation.
Mr. Menendez. And taking into consideration the size of the
vessels that are coming through our ports and through our
channels, given that they have increased in size over--
definitely since 1977, that would be part of the analysis, is
that correct?
Mr. Bhatt. Absolutely, sir, yes.
Mr. Menendez. Yes, I appreciate that.
The Port Infrastructure Development Program provides grants
to support efforts to improve port and related infrastructure
and meet our supply chain needs. Between 2019 and 2023, this
program received $9 billion in applications, but only received
$2.25 billion in appropriations over 5 years in the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
Mr. Bhatt, should we be doing more to invest in landside
infrastructure?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Representative. I have been actually
at a bunch of ports just this week. I served on the port board
in Wilmington, Delaware. And I would say there is a critical
need for infrastructure everywhere, including for the one that
you mentioned.
Mr. Menendez. And how would increased appropriations to the
Port Infrastructure Development Program potentially help
prevent future tragedies?
Mr. Bhatt. Sir, I would want to consult with the folks at
MARAD to get you a specific answer to that question.
Mr. Menendez. OK, fair enough.
To Chair Homendy, I understand that you are limited today
in what you can share regarding this particular incident, but
can you touch on what features may be implemented on both new
and existing bridges to better protect them from potential
impacts like what we saw in Baltimore?
Ms. Homendy. Yes, this is what we are looking at as part of
our investigation, and we are working with Maryland to evaluate
their other bridges. And then we are looking at other areas in
the United States where bridge owners have improved bridge
infrastructure after a vessel strike, including any sort of
fender systems, pier protection, dolphins. That is exactly what
we are looking at. We don't have recommendations today on that.
But again, I would stress that States and bridge owners
should be evaluating, especially with older bridges, what is
going through as far as in their navigable waterways now, what
is the risk, and how should they address that.
Mr. Menendez. And quickly, a followup. Do you anticipate or
have a sense of timing of when those recommendations might be
made available, just given sort of the timely importance of
making sure that the existing infrastructure throughout the
country is up to date?
Ms. Homendy. So, we often issue urgent safety
recommendations--and we may in this case decide to issue an
urgent safety recommendation--at any time, including before we
issue a final report. We are aiming for 18 months on a final
report. But again, we may have updates to the investigation
that we release, and we may issue urgent safety
recommendations, as well.
Mr. Menendez. I think this might make sense in this
instance to ensure that people feel secure when they are
crossing any types of these bridges.
Thank you, Madam Chair, I yield back.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentleman yields back, and I
recognize Mr. Ezell for 5 minutes for questions.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and thank you all for
being here today. I appreciate all of you and your hard work
and dedication.
Vice Admiral, we have a town in my county named after you,
but we pronounce it a little different there in south
Mississippi. So, Gautier is the way we say it, but we will just
leave that to us. So, anyway, as you know, one of the few
remaining United States shipbuilders is in my county district,
Huntington Ingalls. And what can be done to encourage the
greater use of United States-flagged vessels to ensure that
ships coming through our ports are held to the highest
mechanical standards?
Admiral Gautier. Yes, thanks, Congressman. I think I might
be named after somebody who grew up in that town.
But the Coast Guard works very hard to assure that, with
the number of foreign-flagged vessels that call on U.S. ports
every single day, that we maintain an equivalent level of
safety. We do this through the International Maritime
Organization. Actually, they are meeting this week on a number
of issues of emerging technologies.
So, we have done things like worked on the standards of
training, watchkeeping, and certification for all mariners,
U.S. and international, and we want to do this in a way, sir,
that doesn't disadvantage our U.S. mariners so we can have the
equivalent levels that global shipping and global crews on
vessels have to adhere to.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you. Additionally, do you think this
incident could be a cause for recommending harbor tugs escort
large ships through larger channels?
And if so, do you think this incident could have been
avoided?
Admiral Gautier. It may be, but we don't know yet. It is
too early in the investigation to understand whether tugs would
or would not have helped in this circumstance.
Although what I will say is that there are some areas in
some ports around the U.S. that have tug escort requirements
for a variety of reasons, and they are all different. For
example, under the Verrazzano Bridge, for example, the State of
California, for tank vessels entering into the San Francisco
Bay area, those determinations are typically made by harbor
safety committees, with all stakeholders getting together to
understand the totality of risks, not just the Coast Guard, and
then agreeing on what tug requirements might be particular to
that area of risk.
Mr. Ezell. Very good.
Administrator Bhatt, I noticed in the DOT fiscal year 2025
appropriations budget request that there were no additional
funds provided beyond the annual $100 million authorization in
the emergency relief fund. Given the backlog of requests and
unmet needs, especially in Mississippi, how do you anticipate
fulfilling the request for all highway projects and this
bridge?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Congressman, for that question. I
know that the OMB director was part of a tour of the site a few
weeks ago.
I don't want to get ahead of the administration, but I
believe that, generally speaking, the ER backlog has been
topped up through supplementals historically, and I believe
that may be part of the discussion.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you. Continuing with you, along with
ensuring the process moves along quickly, how do you plan to
coordinate with the State of Maryland and other stakeholders to
ensure that proper funds are obligated quickly?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Congressman. It is absolutely top of
mind. And having worked in the private sector, I know that
projects delivered on time and on budget are always our target.
And so, we are moving with great speed, working in close
coordination with them to make sure that they are hitting all
of the timelines. And they have set an aggressive schedule, as
well.
Mr. Ezell. Very good.
Chair Homendy, it has been reported, the actions taken by
the vessel and the State police who took swift action to
minimize the casualties. In the future, how can we better
improve the communication between vessels, people on the
bridge, and emergency responders?
Ms. Homendy. Well, that is part of our investigation, and
we will look at that. It was key, when the pilots reached out
to the dispatchers, and the dispatchers called MDTA police, it
was a very quick notification to shut down operations on the
bridge. And everyone just involved in that was--it was a heroic
effort, certainly. So, we will look at that as part of our
investigation to determine what should be the standard going
forward.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you. And thank you all again for being
here today.
And Madam Chairman, I yield back.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentleman yields, and I recognize
Mr. Auchincloss for 5 minutes for questions.
Mr. Auchincloss. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Some of my colleagues today have indicated their support
for the concept of Federal moneys being repaid through tolling
on the bridge. I would associate myself with that concept and
with interest in that concept. I think in general, tolling on
critical infrastructure is an appropriate way to fund it in the
long run. And I would encourage the relevant agencies in
Congress to consider that not just for this bridge, but for all
bridges going forward as we think about how to responsibly fund
critical infrastructure and address the backlog.
Vice Admiral, I appreciate your testimony, and I appreciate
also, the unified response in Baltimore that you have been part
of. And I am concerned, though, about the strain on the Coast
Guard, and whether that is going to further exacerbate the
Service's challenges in operating with a budget and workforce
deficit.
Since the surge in Baltimore wasn't anticipated, there will
be downstream effects on other Coast Guard missions and
stations. If the Service does not receive additional resources
from Congress, what are the likely short- and long-term
consequences for operations in a place like Massachusetts?
Admiral Gautier. Congressman, as you know, we surge
resources to the top priorities at the moment, whether that be
a bridge collapse or a hurricane response, or a search and
rescue case.
But to your point, more often we do that and with
insufficient budget to make sure that we can do things like
recapitalize our assets. And to close this urgent workforce gap
that we have in enlisted ranks, our ability to do that is going
to be eroded over time.
Mr. Auchincloss. So, articulate the tradeoffs that we might
have to make. What should Congress understand about tradeoffs
that have to happen if you are not resourced appropriately?
Admiral Gautier. So, take, for example, this near 10-
percent enlisted workforce shortfall. If we do not have the
resourcing or the--I am sorry, the recruiting and retention
capability within the Coast Guard in order to get that back up
to normal, then we are going to have to continue on doing the
sorts of things that we have done like not completely staffing
certain stations around the country where there might be some
redundancies. We might not----
Mr. Auchincloss [interrupting]. And then what does that
mean for your mission set? So, can you not do, for example, law
enforcement for recreational boating? Can you not do a legal
fisheries law enforcement? Like, what are some of the missions
that might get eroded if you don't have the resourcing?
Admiral Gautier. That's right. We are going to have to make
tough choices to deliberately back off of doing certain things
that we would normally do, like some recreational boardings,
like some fisheries law enforcement boardings, like some lower
priority aids to navigation around the country.
Mr. Auchincloss. Good. I think it is important to be
specific about the tradeoffs, because I want Congress to
understand that you can't get something for nothing, and we
have to fund the Coast Guard's vital 11 missions.
I know you are also, conducting an Atlantic Coast Port
Access Route Study, one of the goals of which is to reduce the
risk of marine casualties and increase the efficiency of vessel
traffic on the Atlantic coast. How is the Coast Guard
reevaluating this study in light of the Baltimore accident?
And how should ports evaluate potential risks to their
infrastructure going forward?
Admiral Gautier. I think Baltimore is a sober reminder of
the consequences when you have large vessels, and then you have
a mishap, and then you have some critical infrastructure, and
then we have the results that we have seen.
What we are doing in terms of the port access route study
is exactly to prevent those sorts of circumstances. As we know
that there will be more fixed objects--i.e., wind turbines,
wind farms offshore starting in New England and then working
down to other parts of the country--we need to have assurances
that there are shipping lanes that will be free from the
construction of offshore wind farms so that maritime
transportation can continue at low risk to collisions and
allisions.
Mr. Auchincloss. I appreciate it, and I will yield back.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentleman yields back, and I
recognize Mr. Williams for 5 minutes for questions.
And I apologize for skipping you earlier. Sorry.
Mr. Williams of New York. That is all right. Thank you,
Madam Chairman.
Thank you all for being here and for your expert testimony.
I have read through the accident report, such as it is, and
would like to follow up on some details of that, just to try to
understand it.
And maybe, Madam Chairwoman, I will start with you. Do we
know--I am sure we do--are we looking at the manufacturers of
HR1, LR1 breakers, the tie bus, the transformer, the control
system, all of those things that appear in the switchboard
cabinet? In your report, you have the inspector that is taping
those shut. Have we identified the manufacturer of all of those
components, including the subassemblies and the things that are
inside?
Ms. Homendy. Yes. So, we are currently working with
Hyundai, who manufactured many of the components, and they are
a party to our investigation and have come to Baltimore to work
with us to do testing on board the vessel. And our engineers
are back on board the vessel today.
Mr. Williams of New York. So, I understand that Hyundai
would assemble the control system--the panel, if you will--like
a panel shop would. But the individual components inside,
whether that is a PLC or a SCADA system or sensors, actuators,
whatever those things are, are we looking all the way down into
the components, the whole supply chain that made up all those
components?
Ms. Homendy. We are.
Mr. Williams of New York. And is there--when you represent
the transformer, the ICMS, the integrated control and
monitoring system, you are saying all of that comes from
Hyundai?
Ms. Homendy. Not every----
Mr. Williams of New York [interrupting]. This is----
Ms. Homendy [continuing]. Not every single feature or
sensor comes from Hyundai. But if we are looking at any sensors
or pumps or any other component on the vessel, then we will
work with whoever that manufacturer is.
Mr. Williams of New York. Is there an investigation into
cybersecurity that is being evaluated for all these components?
Ms. Homendy. Well, currently we have no evidence at this
time to suggest that this was a cybersecurity threat. It has
been stated at Unified Command that the Coast Guard and FBI
also did not believe this was a cybersecurity issue. We have a
memorandum of understanding with the FBI that, if there is any
evidence of that, we have to turn this over immediately to
them.
Mr. Williams of New York. Is there a criminal investigation
going on at all?
Ms. Homendy. I am aware that there is some work being done
by the Department of Justice, but that is not within the NTSB's
purview.
Mr. Williams of New York. So, in a cybersecurity or a cyber
attack, there is a lot of concern about embedded systems
embedded into what is called a real-time operating system, or
inside the control logic, or inside the control elements there.
That would require an enormous amount of sophisticated
forensics to evaluate. And I would think--which would require
dismantling that whole switchboard and doing a component-by-
component search. Is that kind of investigation underway?
Ms. Homendy. Our investigators have over 400 years of
experience who are investigating this accident itself, and they
go where the evidence takes them.
As far as anything the Department of Justice or FBI is
doing, that is not something I can speak to.
Mr. Williams of New York. Well, in terms of 400 years of
experience, it is probably just the last 5 that are relevant in
terms of cybersecurity, particularly in industrial controls.
Ms. Homendy. Right. My point, though, is they have
significant expertise on----
Mr. Williams of New York [interposing]. I understand.
Ms. Homendy [continuing]. Safety----
Mr. Williams of New York [interrupting]. I understand your
point, and I have significant expertise, as well.
And so, the point of my question is, as we have seen in
embedded systems and in very integrated components from a wide
variety of vendors, that understanding the entire supply chain,
understanding and evaluating things all the way down to the
operating system or even the BIOS and other features deep in
the systems is critically important.
As I read through the accident report, it is not clear to
me that anybody knows why those breakers tripped, why the
transformer tripped offline, what dumped the bus. And it seems
like, until we know the origin of the actual accident, that all
of these things should be taken as likely or at least possible.
Would you agree?
Ms. Homendy. Yes. This is a preliminary report, and what we
released yesterday was preliminary. We are still conducting our
investigation. And we go where the evidence takes us.
Mr. Williams of New York. And that includes a forensics on
the actual components that are there, which would require
significant disassembly and evaluation, in my opinion.
Ms. Homendy. We will follow the evidence, and anything
security-wise, if we find anything, we will turn it over
immediately to the criminal authorities.
Mr. Williams of New York. Thank you very much.
I yield back.
Ms. Homendy. Thank you.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentleman yields back, and I
recognize myself for 5 minutes for questioning.
You have all been sitting here for a long time. You have
been pretty thoroughly questioned. I just want to wrap up with,
is there anything any of you want to highlight for your
respective agencies that will be helpful to this committee that
you haven't already covered?
I will start with Vice Admiral Gautier and we will move
down the line.
Admiral Gautier. Congresswoman, a factual statement. I
think that this has been pretty thoroughly questioned.
In terms of the--I have been asked several questions in
terms about Coast Guard resourcing, and I think it bears
repeating from our perspective, we are incredibly proud of the
folks in the field who have responded. They have done an
amazing job with their counterparts to do this.
We cannot guarantee over time that the Coast Guard is going
to be able to perform at that level--whether that be a search
and rescue case, or a patrol in Asia, or patrolling for the
potential for mass migration in the Caribbean--without
substantial support and enduring support from Congress and the
appropriations side in terms of recapitalizing our aging assets
and improving our procurement, construction, and improvement
support from Congress, the things that help the people in terms
of training that leads us to successful operations like this.
So, I appreciate the opportunity to convey that to you.
Ms. Maloy. Major General Graham?
General Graham. Thank you. Thank you for that question and
the opportunity to be here today.
Probably two points I would just like to wrap up with. We
talked a lot about safety of the general public. I just want to
commend the teams on site, from the Coast Guard to the port to
the various agencies--knock on wood right now--it has been an
amazingly safe operation. It was probably some of the riskiest
diving operations you can have, tethered divers going down,
water you certainly can't see to the end of your fingers with.
We were guiding them by sonar, really. Steel sticking out. And
they did it amazingly safely. The job is not over yet, and our
commitment is to continue that safety record until the Federal
channel is completely cleared.
There was a lot of discussion on the resiliency of
infrastructure. About 3 weeks after the Dali hit the bridge,
some barges broke away on the Ohio River near Pittsburgh, and
they bounced off of two of the locks and dams that the Corps
runs on the upper reaches of the Ohio River. And the
infrastructure withstood those strikes because it was designed
to withstand those strikes.
Right now we are trying to stretch taxpayers' dollars as
far as we can, and we are looking at some of the gates on those
structures to see if we can go from steel to fiber reinforced
polymers. And one of the things we are taking a look at is to
see, well, if we do build them from fiber reinforced polymer,
will they withstand barge strikes and whatnot as well as steel
does. And so, all that is to make a shameless plug for research
and development funding that we agencies need to continue to
advance the state of engineering. Thank you.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. Shameless plug noted.
Mr. Bhatt?
Mr. Bhatt. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would just end where I
started, which is: I have been around a number of these sort of
bridge disasters or disasters, and just the confidence I feel
that this response, whether it is through the Unified Command
or the Army Corps or the Coast Guard, Federal Highways, all the
various parts of U.S. DOT, I feel like it has just been such an
exemplary response and a message to send to the American people
that, when disaster strikes, the Government is there, working
in close coordination with the private sector.
I appreciate a lot of the questions from the majority
around the funding of the bridge. I appreciate their concern
for fully funding it, open to looking at the different
methodologies that they brought forward.
I would just highlight, from a Federal Highways
perspective, that there is $3.7 billion, including the bridge,
of unmet need across the country in red States and blue States,
and the ER Program, as it is designated, we want to follow the
law, and it doesn't really matter the color of the State. We
are going to show up, and we want to make sure that the funding
is available for ER Programs across the country.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you.
Ms. Homendy?
Ms. Homendy. Thank you. First of all, let me thank this
committee.
On a bipartisan basis you led the effort to reauthorize the
NTSB as part of FAA reauthorization. So, thank you very much
for that.
You also led the way on fully funding the NTSB, along with
House appropriators, for our request for fiscal year 2024. We
hope you will do the same for fiscal year 2025.
But our fiscal year 2024 funding came in a little bit
lower. Again, we fully appreciate it because it is higher than
we receive now. But if you just look at this investigation, we
have 12 people in our Office of Marine Safety. They need an
additional five. That doesn't include all the other modes
within the NTSB that need people and the supporting offices, as
well as dealing with unfunded mandates, lab equipment, and
training needs. So, the $10.7 million that we got in an
increase in fiscal year 2024 actually translated into a little
over $5 million, because we had to take on a 5.2-percent pay
raise. Well deserved, but we have to think about the impact on
the smaller agencies there.
And so, we have about $5 million, and we have to figure
out, OK, what 11 positions out of the hundreds can we fund. So,
for the Office of Marine Safety itself, 12 people on their
staff, half of which are dedicated to this particular accident,
and they have over 60 other cases, and what happens is those
get pushed a little bit so they could focus on the next major
one. So, any support you can provide for fiscal year 2025 is
really appreciated.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. One more really quick question.
Major General Graham, does the Corps have an updated
timeline for when the full Federal navigation channel will
open?
General Graham. Our commitment is to have it fully open by
the end of this month. Sooner, if possible.
Ms. Maloy. OK, thank you. I am way over my time, but they
gave me the gavel, so, nobody is stopping me. Thank you.
I yield back. Are there any further questions from any
members of the committee who have not been recognized?
Seeing none, that concludes our hearing for today.
I would like to thank each of the witnesses for your
testimony.
And the committee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 1:08 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]

Submissions for the Record

----------

Letter of May 15, 2024, to Hon. Sam Graves, Chairman, and Hon. Rick
Larsen, Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
from Hon. Kweisi Mfume, Member of Congress, Submitted for the Record by
Hon. Rick Larsen
Congress of the United States,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC 20515,
May 15, 2024.
The Honorable Sam Graves,
Chairman,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of
Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Rick Larsen,
Ranking Member,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of
Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen:
Our nation experienced a terrible tragedy in the early morning of
March 26, 2024, when a large cargo ship, by the name of the Dali,
collided into and collapsed the Baltimore Francis Scott Key Bridge into
the Patapsco River--leading to the tragic loss of six lives and
contributing to a major disruption of the nation's supply chain.
This unimaginable disaster claimed the lives Dorlian Castillo
Cabrera, Miguel Luna, Maynor Yassir Suazo Sandoval, Alejandro Hernandez
Fuentes, Carlos Hernandez, and Jose Mynor Lopez.
The six hardworking men who were taken from us too soon were
husbands, fathers, and brothers, and their passing serves as a solemn
reminder to cherish the lives of those we care about so deeply. These
men gave their heart, sweat, and soul to our country. Their families
can never be reminded enough of our condolences, prayers, or
sympathies.
In this time of great tragedy, I commend the heroic, fast-acting
first responders who jumped into action within minutes of the Dali's
mayday call. I, and others, are exceedingly grateful for their
coordinated and skillful efforts, which prevented further loss of life.
I would be remiss if I didn't also acknowledge the efforts of the
Unified Command team, who were some of the first boots on the ground,
and have responded to this crisis with calmness, diligence, and
precision. Their hard work to reopen the Patapsco River's main shipping
channel expeditiously is awe-inspiring.
Amidst the trials and tribulations of this tragedy, our unified
Team Maryland composed of the Governor, all members of our
Congressional delegation, and the Mayor and County Executive of
Baltimore, has never ceded to the challenges we have faced.
However, this isn't a ``Baltimore issue,'' it's an ``American
issue,'' and I am appreciative of all the support from my congressional
colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, and from all corners of the
nation.
The billions of dollars of products and commodities that flow into
and out of the Port of Baltimore each year cannot be understated. The
closure of the Port's main shipping channel strains the Nation's supply
chain, impacting the shipments of automobiles, farming and machinery
equipment, sugar, coal, and aluminum nationwide.
That is why I, along with the entire Maryland Congressional
delegation, introduced H.R. 7961, the Baltimore BRIDGE Relief Act. This
bicameral, bipartisan legislation would authorize the federal
government to fully fund the replacement of the Francis Scott Key
Bridge and its approaches in Baltimore, Baltimore County, and Anne
Arundel County, Maryland. Equally as important, there is also a
liability section in the Baltimore BRIDGE Relief Act that restates a
preexisting regulation requiring the federal government to be
reimbursed to the full amount received from any compensation derived
from insurance claims or any other source of compensation related to
the bridge collapse.
While the exact contents of potential legislation have not yet been
finalized, the Maryland delegation stands united in our commitment to
securing funding that covers 100 percent of the Francis Scott Key
Bridge rebuild.
With so much at stake, it is imperative to have a successful
American response to this disaster. I urge my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle to keep these important details in mind when responding to
this national disaster.
Sincerely,
Kweisi Mfume,
Member of Congress.

Statement of Rear Admiral Benjamin K. Evans, Director, Office of Coast
Survey, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Submitted for
the Record by Hon. Daniel Webster
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Response to
the DALI/Francis Scott Key Bridge Allision
NOAA had a significant presence at the Unified Command for the
Francis Scott Key Bridge incident.
Upon learning of the bridge collapse in the middle of the night,
NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters were proactive,
preparing to send a forecaster to assist the effort. The Maryland
Emergency Operations Center is under construction, so NWS staff drove
in the middle of the night to the Francis Scott Key Bridge area,
knowing their forecast decision support services would be needed. The
call for forecast support from the Maryland Department of Emergency
Management (MDEM) came first thing in the morning, and the NWS
forecaster was immediately on site to provide the needed forecast
decision support services. NWS meteorologists were deployed to
Maryland's Emergency Operations Center from March 26-March 31 to
provide forecasts for first responders as well as other weather
information to support response efforts. Forecasts supporting the
operation continued, with on-site support no longer required after
March 31. Russell J. Strickland, Secretary, Executive Office of
Maryland Department of Emergency Management and current President of
the National Emergency Managers Association, was extremely appreciative
of the NWS efforts to support the response.
NOAA's Office of Response and Restoration's (OR&R) Disaster
Preparedness Program activated the National Ocean Service Incident
Management Team to collect information and enhance coordination across
NOAA's National Ocean Service on personnel, mission, infrastructure,
and response activities to support messaging up to NOAA leadership and
beyond. The NOAA Mid-Atlantic Scientific Support Coordinator responded
on-scene to support USCG hazmat and pollution assessment and develop
protection strategies and contingency plans. The OR&R Emergency
Response Division Scientific Support Team completed hazmat assessments
that informed the risk and reactivity for the 56 Dangerous Goods
containers on board. Detailed assessments were specifically conducted
for the 13 containers located in the forward stacks crushed by the
collapsing bridge and identified as containing hazardous materials. At
the request of the USCG Federal On-Scene Coordinator, the Scientific
Support Team also produced oil trajectory forecasts every 48 hours for
the seven week response for situational awareness to plan how to
respond should a worst case scenario from the M/V DALI have occurred.
At the request of the USCG, the Office of Coast Survey Navigation
Response Team-New London (NRT-NL) deployed to Baltimore, accompanied by
the Mid-Atlantic Navigation Manager. NRT-NL arrived on March 29 and
began conducting hydrographic surveys through March 31 to identify safe
shallow-draft channels through the remaining spans of the bridge. The
team collected 157 linear nautical miles of multi-beam data, which was
processed each night and provided to Unified Command. The team also
collected laser scan data of the undamaged bridge spans to determine
the height and width available to vessels transiting the alternate
route. This data allowed USCG to identify and buoy a safe alternate
route for vessel traffic. The Office of Coast Survey data was provided
to the USACE, all of which was to aid in calculations for how much
material needed to be removed. NRT-NL returned to Baltimore on April 17
to conduct additional multibeam sonar surveys to create high resolution
bathymetric maps of the increasingly deeper channels as the salvage
teams worked to remove materials.
Coast Survey rapidly integrated all available data into a new NOAA
Electronic Navigational Chart which was made publicly available on
April 3rd. The rapid response required testing a new mode of operation
for chart production. Historically, chart updates have taken weeks or
months, but the new mode of operations allowed for daily chart updates.
The National Geodetic Survey and the Office of Marine and Aviation
Operations NOAA King Air conducted two mission flights under their own
authority on March 28 and March 29, collecting 5 cm resolution imagery
of the bridge and surrounding channel in support of NOAA nautical
charting needs, hazardous material removal, marine debris collection,
and other coastal management needs, which was immediately shared with
Unified Command. The high resolution imagery served as the baseline
coastal dataset for the event and helped inform debris removal needs.
This data is further anticipated to support future engineering needs.
On April 4th, the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and
Services (CO-OPS) deployed a temporary Real-Time Currents Buoy (CURBY)
to provide real-time measurements for currents and key meteorological
parameters [https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports/
ports.html?id=cb1501&mode=show_all] (wind, air temperature, water
temperature, air pressure and salinity) for Unified Command decision
support. A longstanding bridge air gap system and a standalone
meteorological station affixed to the structure were destroyed in the
incident. An additional standalone meteorological station on a concrete
dolphin adjacent to the bridge and water level observations from a
nearby NOAA National Water Level Observation (NWLON) station remained
operational providing uninterrupted data for recovery and salvage
efforts. On June 4th, CO-OPS installed a temporary Hawkins Point
meteorological station [https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports/
ports.html?id=
8574731&mode=show_all] on the western section of the bridge that
remains standing. These new meteorological observations have been
integrated into NOAA's Chesapeake Bay Physical Oceanographic Real Time
System (PORTS) [https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports/
index.html?port=cn].

Question to Vice Admiral Peter Gautier, Deputy Commandant for
Operations, U.S. Coast Guard, from Hon. Sam Graves

Question 1. With bridge safety at the forefront of everyone's mind,
including in the Midwest just north of my district where a barge struck
the Fort Madison Bridge and shut down operations for a few hours, do
you think an evaluation of the Truman-Hobbs list of bridges makes sense
and should Congress look for resources to fund those critical
infrastructure assets? Please explain your position.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question to Vice Admiral Peter Gautier, Deputy Commandant for
Operations, U.S. Coast Guard, from Hon. Bruce Westerman

Question 1. What challenges do you envision during the period of
construction relative to maintaining the shipping channel? For example,
will construction of the new bridge be particularly challenged by the
circumstances in the shipping channel?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

construction relative to maintaining the shipping channel? For example,
will construction of the new bridge be particularly challenged by the
circumstances in the shipping channel?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2. Is it important that the new bridge be taller and/or
have a wider clear span to accommodate future maritime needs? If so,
how do those maritime requirements reconcile with the desire to limit
NEPA to a categorical exclusion?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question to Major General William H. Graham, Deputy Chief of Engineers,
Deputy Commanding General, and Deputy Commanding General for Civil and
Emergency Operations, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, from Hon. Bruce
Westerman

Question 1. What challenges do you envision during the period of
construction relative to maintaining the shipping channel? For example,
will construction of the new bridge be particularly challenged by the
circumstances in the shipping channel?
Answer. Bridge construction during maintenance dredging within the
federal channel will require coordinated operations between bridge
construction crews, the port, the US Coast Guard, and the Corps. Post
construction surveys also will be necessary to update NOAA's nautical
charts.
A similar successful model is the recent Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge
construction across the Cooper River in Charleston, SC, which allowed
the port to be at 100% operational during construction operations.

Question 2. Is it important that the new bridge be taller and/or
have a wider clear span to accommodate future maritime needs? If so,
how do those maritime requirements reconcile with the desire to limit
NEPA to a categorical exclusion?
Answer. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) would be the lead
federal agency for the new bridge and NEPA compliance. The US Coast
Guard has the primary responsibility to issue permits for bridges over
navigable waterways, ensuring the safe navigability into and out of the
Port of Baltimore. As plans and designs are finalized, the FHWA, USCG,
and the Corps will continue to work with State and Federal agencies
involved in bridge construction to address any potential impacts during
or after construction to the federal channel.

Questions to Hon. Shailen Bhatt,\
\ Administrator, Federal
Highway Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, from Hon.
Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
\ Administrator Bhatt resigned from the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) effective September 10, 2024. These responses are
provided on behalf of FHWA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1. Administrator Bhatt, during the hearing, you confirmed
that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), on April 29, 2024,
approved a request by the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)
to designate a segment of highway including the Francis Scott Key
Bridge (``the Bridge'') as part of the Interstate System.
I understand that MDOT sought a concurrent process for its request
to designate the Bridge as part of the Interstate System, meaning it
submitted requests to both FHWA and the American Association of State
Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) at the same time.
Question 1.a. Are such requests routinely submitted and/or
considered concurrently?
Answer. Approval of modifications to the Interstate Highway System
are made by the Administrator. This includes the numbering of segments
on the Interstate Highway System. FHWA regulations on Interstate System
modifications require States to coordinate proposed numbering of
Interstate Highway System segments with the Route Numbering Committee
of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials (AASHTO). FHWA considers that committee's decisions in route
numbering approvals. The AASHTO Route Numbering Committee's decisions
are made via a rolling review process.

Question 1.b. If yes, please provide examples.
Answer. FHWA does not track specific dates of the submission of
requests to AASHTO. States often submit their proposed numbering
schemes to AASHTO in advance of submitting modification requests to
FHWA. However, sometimes the submissions to AASHTO and FHWA occur close
in time.

Question 2. Due to the collapse of the Bridge, the MDOT letter
requesting the Bridge be designated as part of the Interstate System
asked FHWA for ``expedited approval.'' Understanding that the MDOT
request was submitted to FHWA on April 19, 2024, and subsequently
approved on April 29, 2024, that represents a ten-day timeline.
Question 2.a. Is that considered an ``expedited process?''
Answer. ``Expedited process'' is an informal term that States use
when they would like to have a modification request considered more
quickly. This can occur for a number of reasons, but often it is
because a governor or local officials would like to hold an event (such
as a ribbon cutting) to commemorate the opening of an Interstate
Highway segment. FHWA works closely with States to support their
timelines, when possible.

Question 2.b. How often has FHWA approved such requests
accommodating an expedited process?
Answer. FHWA does not track requests for an expedited process, but
they are not common. As noted above, FHWA works closely with States to
support their timelines, when possible.

Question 2.c. Please explain and provide examples.
Answer. FHWA processed an expedited request by the State of Indiana
to add a section of congressionally designated future I-69. The State
held an event on August 6, 2024 to commemorate the opening of the last
section of the I-69 corridor between Evansville and Indianapolis

Question 3. Please detail FHWA's typical process and timeline for
approval of Interstate designations.
Question 3.a. Does this process typically take weeks, months, or
years?
Answer. Once the highway segment meets all standards of a highway
on the Interstate System and is a logical addition or connection to the
Interstate System, the State can request the segment's addition to the
Interstate Highway System. The duration of the approval process varies,
depending on the complexity of the request. In addition to working with
the requestor, FHWA coordinates with AASHTO on the route number, as
noted above.

Question 3.b. Please provide examples.
Answer. The length of the approval process varies, depending on the
complexity of the request. Below are some recent examples:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Received            Approval
------------------------------------------------------------------------
New York I-86...................  June 2024.........  Pending.
Indiana I-69....................  June 2024 (revised  July 2024.
version).
Maryland I-695..................  April 2024........  April 2024.
Nevada I-11.....................  February 2023.....  November 2023.
Indiana I-69....................  September 2022....  December 2022.
Texas I-69E.....................  June 2022.........  September 2022.
North Carolina I-587............  May 2021..........  November 2021.
Arkansas I-555..................  January 2021......  April 2021.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 4. Are there other instances of a facility being
designated as part of the Interstate System when that facility no
longer exists?
Question 4.a. If yes, please provide examples.
Answer. In the case of the segment of I-695 that included the
Francis Scott Key Bridge, part of the facility still exists (the
designation was for an 18.8-mile segment). FHWA is unaware of any
examples of a designation where no facility exists.

Question 5. Historically, has FHWA retroactively designated
facilities as part of the Interstate System following either a natural
disaster or a catastrophic failure from any external cause?
Question 5.a. If yes, please explain and provide examples.
Answer. FHWA is not aware of any examples, or requests by States to
make such a designation. The portion of MD-695 that included the
Francis Scott Key Bridge was signed as an Interstate, and anyone using
the facility before the bridge collapsed would have thought it was
already on the Interstate System. States request modifications only a
few times a year, and none of the recent requests were under similar
circumstances.

Question 6. I understand that prior to its collapse, the Bridge was
a toll facility. How much revenue did tolls on this facility generate
in 2023?
Answer. FHWA does not track toll revenue for specific facilities.
For the most accurate responsive information, we defer to the source,
the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA), which reported toll
revenue for the Francis Scott Key Bridge for fiscal year 2023 of
approximately $56 million.

Question 7. In your testimony, you discussed how discretionary
funding may be pursued to repair the Bridge. Please provide a
comprehensive list of the existing programs, discretionary and formula,
for which bridge projects are eligible for funding.
Answer. Bridge projects are eligible for funding under a number of
FHWA formula programs, subject to program-specific requirements: the
Surface Transportation Block Grant Program (STBG), the National Highway
Performance Program (NHPP), the Bridge Formula Program (BFP), and the
Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-
Saving Transportation Program (PROTECT) Formula Program. Bridge
construction is also an eligible expense for a number of discretionary
grant programs, subject to program-specific requirements, including:

National Infrastructure Project Assistance Program
(MEGA);

Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability
and Equity (RAISE);

Bridge Investment Program (BIP);

Infrastructure for Rebuilding America Program (INFRA);

PROTECT;

Rural Surface Transportation Grant Program (RURAL);

Reconnecting Communities Pilot Program; and

Competitive Highway Bridge Program (CHBP).

Question 8. I appreciate the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration's (FMCSA's) efforts to provide regulatory relief for
commercial motor vehicle drivers following the collapse of the Bridge.
I understand FMCSA has extended this relief since its initial issuance
in late March. How has this regulatory relief helped maintain commerce?
Answer. FHWA has conferred with FMCSA to provide this response. The
relief both supported the unprecedented emergency work relating to the
Francis Scott Key Bridge, as well as supply chains impacted by the
collapse that relied on the Port of Baltimore or Baltimore's nationally
significant freight infrastructure. For example, the relief allowed
motor carriers engaged in emergency-related activities, such as salvage
and recovery operations, to conduct the necessary work of removing
bridge debris, without violating Federal requirements, including hours
of service. Additionally, it helped in the efficient and safe rerouting
of freight flows to other East Coast ports because of the collapse and
the transport of critical fuel products to and from the Port of
Baltimore that support the surrounding megaregion, especially regional
industries, military bases, and aircraft operations at BWI Airport.
Fuel and other hazardous material commodities experienced the most
transportation impacts as the FSK Bridge was the key hazardous
materials route through Baltimore along the I-95 corridor, and
rerouting around the region significantly added to travel times. The
two additional hours of service helped fuel-related businesses to
complete their runs in the region efficiently and with a level of
flexibility until adjustments in operations were made to accommodate
new travel times in the region.
Data indicates that diversion routes (as of mid-May) were taking 2
to 4 times longer for some traffic and trucks compared to prior to the
bridge collapse. Collisions also increased along alternate routes. I-95
experienced an increase in traffic (on average) of 12% following the
collapse of the bridge. More recent data shows some of this is
improving but still remains elevated. This is likely to change as
commodities and freight begin to fully return to Baltimore. FMCSA is
actively monitoring these impacts and working with the State of
Maryland, Maryland Motor Truck Association, and other stakeholders to
assess travel impacts and truck parking challenges.

Question 9. You mentioned at the hearing that the Bridge rebuilding
process would likely utilize a FHWA Categorical Exclusion (CE).
Question 9.a. Can you detail exactly which CEs FHWA will be using?
Answer. On July 23, 2024, FHWA determined the reconstruction of the
Francis Scott Key Bridge is appropriately classified as a Categorical
Exclusion (CE) in accordance with Council on Environmental Quality
(CEQ) regulations and 23 CFR 771.117(c)(9) and 23 CFR 771.117(d)(13).
The Project, which proposes rebuilding the Francis Scott Key Bridge
connection along I-695 over the Patapsco River, does not involve any
significant environmental impacts.
The Project will benefit socioeconomic resources by restoring
community connectivity and commerce across the Patapsco River. The
anticipated impacts to natural resources are minimal and will comply
with the required permits and stormwater management approval to further
minimize impacts. Unanticipated impacts to cultural resources, if any,
will be addressed per the Section 106 Programmatic Agreement for the
project. The Project will not provide additional capacity or provide
new access points. As a result, the Project will not induce significant
foreseeable alterations in land use or affect development and growth
beyond what is already expected to occur.

Question 9.b. Please provide an explanation of which CEs have been
used previously for similar projects.
Answer. Similar projects involving a bridge collapse over a
navigable waterway were also processed as categorical exclusions due to
the limited scope of the bridge replacements within existing rights-of-
way along similar alignments as the previous structures. Example
projects include the I-35W Bridge over the Mississippi River in
Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the I-10 Bridge over Escambia Bay in
Florida.

Question 9.c. If no similar projects have been permitted to use
CEs, please provide an explanation of exactly how this Bridge project
differs from previous projects.
Answer. As noted above, similar projects involving a bridge
collapse over a navigable waterway have also been processed as CEs.

Questions to Hon. Shailen Bhatt,\
\ Administrator, Federal
Highway Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, from Hon.
Bruce Westerman
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
\ Administrator Bhatt resigned from the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) effective September 10, 2024. These responses are
provided on behalf of FHWA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1. Maryland transportation officials stated in a public
forum last week that the bridge replacement would be handled under a
categorical exclusion--is that true, and how did FHWA arrive at that
determination? What restrictions will a categorical exclusion place on
the design of the new bridge and is it realistic?
Answer. The project is currently proceeding with a Categorical
Exclusion (CE), since the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)
has limited the project scope of the bridge replacement to occur within
existing Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) right-of-way along
the current centerline of the bridge and its approaches. Reconstruction
is expected to begin within two years of Governor Moore's declaration
of a state of emergency. FHWA approved the CE for reconstruction of the
Francis Scott Key (FSK) Bridge on July 23, 2024. The CE provides the
appropriate level of information to allow for a streamlined permitting
approach with the respective resource agencies. As the project
progresses to final design, FHWA may change the NEPA class of action
and require a higher level of documentation, based on level of impacts
or other criteria established in FHWA's NEPA regulations.

Question 2. What is the likelihood that FHWA might require a higher
degree of NEPA study later in the process, such as after MD has
selected a design-builder?
Answer. As the project progresses to final design with the selected
design-builder, re-evaluations may be necessary to determine whether
supplemental analysis and documentation is needed. A re-evaluation is a
review conducted by FHWA of any proposed change in action, affected
environment, anticipated impact, applicable requirements, or mitigation
measures as they relate to the environmental document or decision. As
noted above, as the project progresses to final design, FHWA may change
the NEPA class of action and require a higher level of documentation,
based on level of impacts or other criteria established in FHWA's NEPA
regulations.

Question 3. Is it important that the new bridge be taller and/or
have a wider clear span to accommodate future maritime needs? If so,
how do those maritime requirements reconcile with the desire to limit
NEPA to a categorical exclusion?
Answer. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has jurisdiction over the
replacement bridge's vertical clearance and a clear navigation span
width. This determination is made by the USCG independent of the NEPA
process considering maritime needs.
FHWA and the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) used the
USCG determined minimum vertical and horizontal clearance for the
approved CE. The USCG determination for the minimum vertical and
horizontal clearance did not change the CE determination and approval
since the new bridge is expected to be built within the existing right-
of-way on the same alignment.

Questions to Hon. Jennifer Homendy, Chair, National Transportation
Safety Board, from Hon. Jefferson Van Drew

Question 1. In your tenure as Chair of the National Transportation
Safety Board, could you please explain how these protective structures
such as ``dolphins'' and ``fenders'' can effectively ensure that an
incident like the Francis Scott Key Bridge Incident does not occur?
Answer. Cell dolphins and pier fenders are intended to passively
protect bridge piers from errant (off course) vessel impact damage
through course redirection and energy absorption. Design guidelines for
these protective structures are based on several factors, including a
vessel's size and speed as well as the density of vessel traffic
normally operating under a given bridge.
The NTSB has investigated numerous marine accidents in which pier
fenders have limited damage from inland barge tows--and, in some cases,
larger ocean-going vessels--that were off course (see Appendix:
Miscellaneous Reports and Guidelines). Although we have investigated
marine accidents involving inland tows and protective cell dolphins, we
have not investigated any accidents involving larger ocean-going
vessels striking dolphins near a bridge.
Dolphins and fenders are only two components that may be used to
protect a bridge and, as such, should be considered holistically as one
part of a systemwide analysis of how best to protect a pier. Many
factors, such as crew/pilot navigation errors, severe weather, or loss
of critical vessel systems, such as propulsion or steering, can result
in a vessel impacting a bridge. Countermeasures to address these
factors need to be examined, taking into consideration the
effectiveness, timeliness, and practicality of their implementation.

Question 2. Would proper implementation of these protective devices
have been effective if they were in place on the Franscis Scott Key
Bridge?
Answer. The dolphins and fendering system used to protect the
Francis Scott Key Bridge were designed and installed using the
engineering judgement available in the late 1970s. Much has changed
since that time, most notably the size (height, length, width, and
weight) of cargo and cruise vessels, and the guidance used to design
and place pier-protection structures. Although a dolphin designed today
may effectively counter a strike by an ocean-going cargo vessel like
the Dali, there is no guarantee that the dolphin would be able to
protect a bridge from all future vessels calling on Baltimore.
We are evaluating the adequacy of the Key Bridge's existing
protection as part of our investigation and examining whether
alternative dolphin designs could have provided better protection,
given constraints such as the navigation channel width and horizontal
clearance between the supporting piers.
It is critical--for the Port of Baltimore and all ports with
bridges over navigable channels in the nation--to examine the issue of
bridge protection using a Safe Systems approach, where all stakeholders
share the responsibility of building and reinforcing multiple layers of
prevention and protection. A variety of solutions must be considered to
create an effective, long-term safety solution--an approach the NTSB
has been promoting for decades.

Question 3. Given the expansive list of bridges in urgent need of
repair nationwide, would you prioritize defensive feature installation
on these projects and how can this be done in the most cost-effective
manner?
Answer. Although there are thousands of highway bridges within the
United States that could benefit from maintenance, the number of
bridges over navigable waterways used by large ocean-going vessels is
far fewer. However, providing physical protection for even a subset of
bridges would be costly and take many years to accomplish. The
vulnerability of a given bridge is based on its unique specifications,
including the bridge design, location, water depth at its supports
relative to the channel, and the span's width and vertical clearance.
The expense and long timeframe necessary to implement such protection
make it imperative to understand fully the risks that increasingly
larger vessels pose to the nation's critical port and navigable
waterway infrastructure. Potential countermeasures to these risk
factors include crew training and decision-making; modifications to
port operations, including tug escorts; enhanced reliability of vessel
propulsion, steering and electrical power systems; and the use of
technology to aid in ship maneuvering.
Appendix: Miscellaneous Reports and Guidelines
Support Pier Contacts

1993: Chris/Judge William Seeber Bridge, New Orleans,
Louisiana, May 28, 1993. Report NTSB HAR-94-03.

Towboat Chris, pushing the empty hopper barge DM 3021, collided
with a support pier of the eastern span of the Judge William Seeber
Bridge in New Orleans, Louisiana. The Judge William Seeber Bridge,
known locally as the Claiborne Avenue bridge, carries Highway Route 39
over the New Orleans Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, known locally as
the Industrial Canal. The impact severed bent 21, causing two approach
spans (about 145 feet of bridge deck) and the two-column bent to
collapse onto the barge and into the shallow waters of the canal. Two
automobiles carrying three people fell with the four-lane bridge deck,
resulting in one death and serious injuries to the other two people.
(See Safety Recommendation M-94-12)

1996: Julie N/Portland-South Portland (Million Dollar)
Bridge, Portland, Maine, September 27, 1996.

The 560-foot-long Liberian tankship Julie N, carrying a cargo of
heating oil, collided with the south bascule pier of the Portland-South
Portland (Million Dollar) Bridge in Portland, Maine, on September 27,
1996. (See Vessel Operations Group Factual Report and Postaccident
Testing for Alcohol and Other Drugs in the Marine Industry and the
Ramming of the Portland-South Portland [Million Dollar] Bridge at
Portland, Maine, by the Liberian Tankship Julie N on September 27,
1996).

2002: U.S. Towboat Robert Y. Love Allision with
Interstate 40 Highway Bridge Near Webbers Falls, Oklahoma, May 26,
2002.

Towboat Robert Y. Love, pushing two empty asphalt tank barges,
was traveling northbound on the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River
Navigation System, near Webbers Falls, Oklahoma. As the tow approached
the Interstate 40 highway bridge at mile 360.3, it veered off course
and rammed a pier 201 feet west of (outside) the navigation channel.
The impact collapsed a 503-foot section of the bridge, which fell into
the river and onto the barges below. According to witnesses, highway
traffic continued to drive into the void in the bridge created by the
collapsed spans. When traffic stopped, eight passenger vehicles and
three truck tractor-semitrailer combinations had fallen into the river
or onto the collapsed portions of the bridge.

2015: Gayle Force/Norfolk Southern Bridge #7, Chesapeake,
Virginia, April 26, 2015.

The starboard bow of the Gayle Force struck the southeast
fendering dolphin and concrete piers supporting the NS#7 bridge span.
The barge was making a speed of 4.4 knots when it struck the bridge.
The timber dolphin was crushed and deformed, and the piers shifted
laterally 15 inches toward the north.
Fender Contacts--Protected/Probably Protected

2007: Allision of Hong Kong-Registered Containership M/V
Cosco Busan with the Delta Tower of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge San Francisco, California November 7, 2007.

Containership M/V Cosco Busan impacted the fendering system at
the base of the Delta tower of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.

2016: Allision of Kodiak Tow with North Landing Bridge.

Tugboat Kodiak impacted the North Landing Bridge at mile marker
20.2 in Chesapeake, Virginia. Just before the allision, the tow had run
over a mooring dolphin located on the north side of the river 750 yards
from the bridge.

2019: Contact of Tanker Dank Silver with Sunshine Bridge.

Bulk liquid cargo vessel Dank Silver was transiting downbound on
the Mississippi River, near Donaldsonville, Louisiana, when it struck
the fender of the western pier to the main (channel) span of the
Sunshine Bridge.
Dolphins/Protection Cells

2002: U.S. Towboat Robert Y. Love Allision with
Interstate 40 Highway Bridge Near Webbers Falls, Oklahoma.

Although the Oklahoma Department of Transportation installed
pier protection cells inside the navigation channel, the I-40 bridge
accident occurred outside the navigation channel. Such occurrences
demonstrate that most bridges over navigable water can be struck either
within or outside the regular navigation channel by barge tows and
individual commercial vessels, thus increasing the complexity of bridge
protection.

2019: Barge Breakaway and Contact with Interstate 10
Bridge.

The protective cell dolphins absorbed most of the barge's
momentum. Damage to the western cell just outside the channel consisted
of crushed and splintered wooden fendering, a collapsed cap, and
fractured concrete exterior on the northeast side that caused the cell
to crumple and fold inward. Erosion from floodwaters removed the
interior dirt that helped anchor the protective cell and provide
absorbing energy from impacts. Damage to the eastern cell closest to
the channel consisted of crushed and splintered wooden fendering and
exterior fractures on the northwest side, including an inward-collapsed
concrete bulkhead. The entire cell also shifted from the impact, and
erosion occurred around the base.

2019: Contact of Dewey R Tow with CSX Railroad Bridge
Protection Cell.

As the Dewey R neared the bridge, a freight train carrying
vehicles passed over the CSX Railroad Bridge, and the pilot stated that
the shiny surfaces on the sides of the train cars and vehicles
reflected the light from his spotlights and created a visual
distraction. At 0123, the bow of the lead barge ATC 3404 struck the
protection cell on the south side of the bridge at a speed of 5.75 mph.
The southern protection cell was displaced over 4 feet in the direction
of the pier. An engineering firm determined the protection cell to be
extensively damaged with a fractured sheet pile that split open and
exposed the concrete within the cell. Also, several pieces of its
fendering system had been dislodged and were no longer in place. The
south corner of the bridge's concrete pier was also damaged, with an
approximate 12-square-foot shallow concrete spall adjacent to the
displaced protection cell, buckled vertical posts, and damaged fenders.

2020: Contact of William C Tow with Rock Island Railroad
Bridge Protection Cell.

Once the vessel had passed through the bridge, there were only
about 1,200 feet for the pilot to maneuver the approximately 662-foot-
long tow back to the center of the channel before reaching the Rock
Island Railroad Bridge protection cell near the left descending bank.
The pilot attempted to move the tow to starboard, but, since the
following current was pushing against the tow, it continued toward the
left descending bank. When the pilot determined there was not enough
time to move the vessel to avoid striking the bridge, he reversed both
engines to slow the vessel, which reduced the force of the impact but
did not prevent the barges from hitting the bridge's protection cell.

Collision Design of Highway Bridges 2009 (2nd
Edition)

Fenders
+  p. 97, C7.3.1: ``In general, fender systems are adequate to
absorb the collision energy and loads associated with medium to small
vessels at low impact speeds and at oblique angles. For larger vessels
and higher impact speeds, other types of protection are usually
required. Exceptions occur for those bridges with very massive pier
structures and high shear and overturning resistance.''

Piles
+  p. 104, C7.3.2: ``[Piles] are designed to elastically resist
the mooring and berthing forces imparted by merchant vessels. In
contrast to mooring operations in which the relatively low impact
energies can be absorbed elastically by piles, the far greater energies
associated with ship collision can usually only be absorbed by plastic
deformation and crushing of the pile structure.''

Dolphins
+  p. 114, C7.3.3: ``The circular shape of the dolphins can help
deflect aberrant vessels away from the pier. The cell should, however,
be designed for the maximum loading case of a head-on impact. If the
dolphin is stronger than the vessel, then the vessel will absorb most
of the impact energy through the crushing of its bow. If the dolphin is
weaker than the vessel, then the dolphin absorbs most of the energy by
large translational (sliding) and rotational deformations.''

Outerbridge Crossing, Perth, Australia (p. 118)

1979: ``A loaded 45,000-DWT tanker struck Cell No.
4 head-on in front of main pier `D' at an estimated collision speed of
2.5 knots. The collision took place during dense fog conditions and
while the vessel was proceeding upstream under a two-tug escort. Only
the center dolphin was hit during the impact, and the ship continued
forward 50 ft before it was dragged to a stop. The ship suffered only
minor damage to its bow. An inspection after the accident revealed that
the steel sheet piling of Dolphin No. 4 had burst open, spilling out
sand, and that the piling on the ship impact side had been pulled out.
The remaining pilings of the cell were bent over at the river bottom.
The 45-ft diameter by 5-ft thick concrete cap was found completely
intact but displaced 50 ft due to the collision.''

1987: ``The dolphin protection of the same main
pier of the Outerbridge Crossing was again tested when a 48,000-tanker
collided with and destroyed Cell No. 5. The cell was 45 ft in diameter
and similar to Cell No. 4 described above.''

Sunshine Skyway Bridge, Tampa Bay, Florida (p. 119-
120)

``The Sunshine Skyway Bridge pier protection system
developed by Greiner, Inc. for the Florida Department of Transportation
utilizes a combination of dolphin and island protection. The main piers
are protected by islands whereas the five approach piers on each side
of the main piers are protected by a dolphin system. The use of
dolphins to protect the high-level approach piers was a result of the
risk analysis which indicated that the high-level approach piers were
vulnerable to a catastrophic vessel collision. The 60-ft diameter cells
were designed to withstand a collision from either a loaded 23,000-DWT
or an empty 87,300-DWT bulk carrier; the 54 ft-4 in. diameter dolphins
from impacts with a loaded 25,000-DWT barge, or an empty 70,000-DWT
vessel; and the 47-foot diameter cells to withstand impacts from a
loaded 15,000-DWT barge or an empty 35,000-DWT ship. All design impact
speeds were 10 knots.''

Island Protection
+  p. 126, C7.3.4: ``The construction of protective islands
around vulnerable bridge piers is considered by most investigators to
provide the highest level of ship collision protection. The islands
typically consist of a sand or rock core which is protected by outer
layers of heavy rock armor to provide protection for the island against
waves and currents.''
FHWA Technical Advisory: Pier Protection and Warning
Systems for Bridges Subject to Ship Collisions
(1983)
``Because of the tremendous momentum achieved by modern ocean-
going vessels even while traveling at low speeds in inland
channels, it may be extremely difficult to retrofit some
existing bridge piers with protective systems which can
successfully withstand the anticipated impact loadings. For
this reason, it becomes particularly important to recognize the
potential hazards from ship collisions and to locate and design
piers on new bridges in such a way that the risks of collision
are reduced to an acceptable level.''
