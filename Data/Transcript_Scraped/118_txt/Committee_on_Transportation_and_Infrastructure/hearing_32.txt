SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Economic Development,
Public Buildings, and Emergency Management
FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public
Buildings, and Emergency Management
RE:      LSubcommittee Hearing on ``Regional Commissions: A
Review of Federal Economic Development Program Effectiveness''
_______________________________________________________________________

I. PURPOSE

The Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings,
and Emergency Management of the Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure will meet on Thursday, October 19, 2023, at
10:00 a.m. ET in 2167 of the Rayburn House Office Building to
receive testimony on a hearing entitled, ``Regional
Commissions: A Review of Federal Economic Development Program
Effectiveness.'' The hearing will analyze the role the
different economic development regional commissions play in
distressed communities across the country. At the hearing,
Members will receive testimony from various regional
commissions including: the Appalachian Regional Commission
(ARC), Delta Regional Authority (DRA), Denali Commission,
Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC), and the Southeast
Crescent Regional Commission (SCRC).

II. BACKGROUND

Currently, there are eight statutorily authorized regional
economic development commissions; however, only five are
active: ARC, DRA, Denali Commission, NBRC, and SCRC.\1\ Each
Commission, with the exception of Denali, is composed of a
Federal co-chair, who is appointed by the President and
confirmed by the Senate, and the governors of the states in
which the commission operates.\2\ The Federal regional
commissions operate as partnerships with state governments with
programming focused on infrastructure, energy, environment,
workforce, and business development.\3\

III. APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION (ARC)

ARC's membership consists of all of West Virginia and parts
of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York,
North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee,
and Virginia.\4\ ARC uses an index-based system to classify
county's levels of economic distress (distressed, at-risk,
competitive, and attainment) to direct funds to the most
vulnerable communities.\5\ To date, ARC has invested nearly
$5.3 billion over 33,000 different projects to help improve the
region's economic position.\6\ ARC focuses their grant programs
on investing in building Appalachian businesses, community
infrastructure, and community capacity. The Partnerships for
Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization (POWER)
program focuses on the 360 counties in the region who are
experiencing job loss due to a declining coal industry by
preparing workers for opportunities in entrepreneurship,
broadband development, tourism, and other industry sectors.\7\

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SCOTT PERRY OF PENNSYLVANIA,
CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC
BUILDINGS, AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

Mr. Perry. I would like to thank our witnesses for being
here today to discuss the role and effectiveness of the
regional commissions for economic development in distressed
communities across the country.
Today, we will hear from five regional commissions: the
Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta Regional Authority,
the Northern Border Regional Commission, the Southeast Crescent
Regional Commission, and the Denali Commission.
These regional commissions are set up to work in
partnership with their member State governments to support
economic development activities. In addition to these regional
commissions, the United States Economic Development
Administration, commonly known as the EDA, a bureau of the
Commerce Department, plays a similar role nationwide. There are
also programs through other Federal departments that play some
role in economic development, such as the Department of
Agriculture, the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
and the Small Business Administration.
Now, I would just let you know, frankly, I don't really
believe so much in the Federal Government's role in so-called
economic development. That's my opinion. These programs simply
allow the Federal Government to, once more, in my opinion, pick
winners and losers, and I hate to see the poor losers in that
whole thing.
To me, private investment and innovation should drive
economic development. States and local governments should be
positioning themselves to create pro-business environments
through reducing regulatory hurdles and the costs of doing
business, and that's how this country and this system was
originally set up.
On top of the duplication concerns that I have, these
programs continue to proliferate and expand. For example, right
now, it seems that the argument for a new regional commission
is that, ``Other geographic areas have them, so, why can't our
area have them?'' And you can certainly understand that. It
just doesn't seem like much of a winning argument to me.
Programs that started out focused on the basic needs of
distressed communities to attract jobs have expanded to include
activities that don't seem really directly related to job
production at all.
I am not blaming any of you. This place set this up. But it
does mean that, at the very least, we should ensure that the
activities you embark on and are funding are not duplicative.
And we must ensure the funding is appropriately targeted and
focused on truly distressed communities for activities that are
directly related to attracting jobs and private investment and
not just used to backfill State and local budgets that don't
want to/can't afford to do these things or just don't want to
pay for them. So, that is the mission statement here.
Notably, all of you received significant increases in
supplemental funding in fiscal year 2021 under the IIJA, the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act--in some cases, 400
percent more than your annual appropriations, an important
consideration as most of your agencies have authorizations that
are expiring and are up for consideration.
And I would just like to characterize in the remaining
time, I have got a little bit left here, that I don't think
that this is necessarily a partisan issue, although it is
always kind of perceived as that.
But Presidents on both sides of the political spectrum have
said these commissions are duplicative and should not exist and
that there are other agencies that are already doing this work.
And we are spending that money, and what we are doing now is
adding another layer for people to jump through.
And so, again, I don't think it's a partisan issue, but
it's our job as Members of Congress to perform the oversight
function.
And as you all know, I don't have to probably tell any of
you, we have got a massive debt load in this country. We are
going to take in $5 trillion in revenue this year, and we are
going to spend $7.2 trillion. And that math just doesn't add
up, I don't care where you live, which commission you
represent, or what community you live in; that doesn't add up,
and that's not a recipe for success.
So, we have got to look at some ways to be efficient. And
maybe the answer is to keep the commissions and get rid of
everything else. I don't know. I imagine we will have some kind
of conversation about that today.
With that, I appreciate your traveling to Washington, DC,
and being here today for the hearing.
[Mr. Perry's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Scott Perry, a Representative in Congress
from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and Chairman, Subcommittee on

Mr. Perry. And with that, I now recognize Ranking Member
Titus for 5 minutes for her opening statement. I yield.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DINA TITUS OF NEVADA, RANKING MEMBER,
SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC BUILDINGS, AND
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Let me offer a counterposition to that. I was thinking my
district is Las Vegas, and Nevada is not covered by a regional
economic development commission. I was thinking it would be a
good idea if we got one. But now I see that my arguments are
going to have to be strengthened other than just that, having
heard the chairman's comments on what he thinks about these.
I, however, think they are a good thing. And thank you all
for coming to share with us what you have done. And it is
important to have this hearing because we haven't addressed
this for several years.
And you do economic development in very different ways
depending on the area that you represent. You respond to what
the needs are there. And oftentimes, local governments, maybe
they are rural counties or small communities, don't have the
resources to do it themselves.
So, it makes sense that there is somebody else to bring
together, to build up structure, to invest in things that we
need, to replace things that have been lost.
You heard a little bit of a description, and I know you all
already know this, but just for the record, there are eight of
these commissions. You five are here today. You are active, you
are functioning, you are funded, and you are staffed.
There is a sixth commission, the Southwest Border Regional
Commission. It's in the process of organizing and hiring staff.
Recently created, I believe last year, was the Great Lakes
Authority, and it doesn't yet have a Federal Cochair. I know
Marcy Kaptur has been working very hard to be sure that that
exists and it's up and running and gets appropriations.
And then the authorization for the Northern Great Plains
Regional Authority--you will be glad to hear this [to Mr.
Perry]--lapsed at the end of 2018.
Now, among those of you who are active, you have each
received between $20 million and $200 million for the fiscal
year of 2023 to support your different various economic
development activities.
And they range in a variety of good projects. You invest in
basic infrastructure, energy, the environment and natural
resources, workforce and business development, and
entrepreneurship programs to help build that private sector to
carry development into the future that we heard the chairman
talk about.
Although you all are federally chartered, and you receive
congressional appropriations, you have a Federal representative
on the commission, but you are very much across Government type
of agencies that work closely as a liaison between the Federal
Government and State and local governments. A lot of input from
what local governments need.
And this is kind of a unique way of doing economic
development because you are place-based, you are across
Government, intergovernmental, and multifaceted. You bring
together a lot of good qualities to move our economy forward.
I believe Federal support is critical for regional economic
development. For example, during the pandemic, southern Nevada
experienced 35 percent unemployment, the highest in the
country, because we are so tied to tourism and outdoor
recreation. Airplanes were empty, hotels were empty, the Strip
was closed down. It was like ``The Twilight Zone.'' So,
naturally, that impacted employment, but also local businesses
that were ancillary to gaming and tourism.
I introduced the INVEST in Our Communities Act, which was
part of the recovery provisions, to try to help economic
diversity and resiliency in all areas that rely heavily on
tourism and would be affected by a catastrophe, like COVID was.
Scarcity of water is a problem affecting the Southwest, and
we need to keep consumption top of mind when we are investing
or looking for new industry or new businesses to come to an
area. That's a role that you all could play.
So, you each do it in a very specific way to your area,
whether you have to respond to closing down old factories,
closing coal mines, loss of tourism, or climate impacts.
So, I commend you for what you do. I think it is valuable.
And I look forward to learning some lessons from you in case we
do have one in our area at some point in the future. So, thank
you very much for being here.
I yield back.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Dina Titus, a Representative in Congress
from the State of Nevada, and Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Economic
Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management
Thank you, Chairman Perry. I am pleased that we are having this
hearing today as it has been several years since the Subcommittee
examined the regional economic development commissions.
Of the eight federal regional commissions and authorities, the five
here with us today are active, functioning, funded, and staffed. Those
are the Appalachian Regional Commission; the Delta Regional Authority;
the Denali Commission; the Northern Border Regional Commission; and the
Southeast Crescent Regional Commission.
A sixth commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission
(SBRC), is in the process of organizing and hiring staff. The Great
Lakes Authority is inactive as it does not have a federal co-chair and
has not yet received appropriations, and the authorization for the
Northern Great Plains Regional Authority lapsed at the end of Fiscal
Year 2018.
Among the active commissions, each received $20 million to $200
million for Fiscal Year 2023 to support their various economic
development activities, which range from investing in basic
infrastructure; energy; the environment and natural resources;
workforce; and business development and entrepreneurship programs.
Though they are federally chartered, receive congressional
appropriations for their administration and activities, and include an
appointed federal representative in their respective leadership
structures, the regional commissions are quasi-governmental
partnerships between the federal government and their constituent
states. This partnership structure allows for substantial input and
efforts at the sub-state level and represents unique federal approaches
to economic development--ones that are place-based, intergovernmental,
and multifaceted in their programmatic orientations.
Federal support for regional economic development is crucial
because we all have unique challenges. For example, during the
pandemic, Southern Nevada experienced 33 percent unemployment due to
our strong economic ties to travel, tourism, and outdoor recreation.
Airplanes were empty, hotels and restaurants were closed, and
entertainment venues were shuttered. This negatively impacted
employment and local government revenues.
That is why I introduced the bipartisan INVEST in Our Communities
Act, which will help promote economic development and resiliency to
future disruptions in regions that rely heavily on the tourism economy,
while also investing in workforce development programs to help fill the
nearly 1.2 million open positions in its ancillary sectors.
The scarcity of water is also impacting my region, as cities and
economic development agencies have to keep consumption top of mind when
determining which businesses they want to attract to Southern Nevada.
As you can see, every region requires a unique approach for
economic development, and for districts like mine which are not covered
by a commission, there are still lessons that we can take away. That is
why I am happy to be joined by our witnesses today and look forward to
hearing your testimony. Thank you.

Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady.
The Chair would now like to welcome our witnesses and thank
them for being here today: the Honorable Gayle Manchin from the
Appalachian Regional Commission; the Honorable Corey Wiggins
from the Delta Regional Authority; the Honorable Chris Saunders
from the Northern Border Regional Commission; the Honorable
Jennifer Clyburn Reed from the Southeast Crescent Regional
Commission; and Mr. Garrett Boyle from the Denali Commission.
Briefly, I would like to take a moment to explain our
lighting system to our witnesses. I don't know if you have been
here before or not.
So, there are three lights in front of you with buttons
associated with them. I guess you don't have the button. You
have the button for the talk. If you are talking you have to
push that button so we can hear you.
But there are three lights in front of you. Green means go
and keep going. Yellow means you are going to run out of time
in maybe about a minute or so; so, you want to be kind of
thinking about wrapping it up. And red means you are kind of
out of time, and we would hope that you would conclude your
remarks.
The Chair now asks unanimous consent that the witnesses'
full statements be included in the record.
Without objection, so ordered.
The Chair asks unanimous consent that the record of today's
hearing remain open until such time as our witnesses have
provided answers to any questions that may be submitted to them
in writing.
Without objection, so ordered.
The Chair also asks unanimous consent that the record
remain open for 15 days for any additional comments and for
information submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in
the record of today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
Given the number of witnesses here today, we were not able
to invite all interested in this subject. So, the Chair asks
unanimous consent to enter into the record written testimony
submitted by David Ditch from The Heritage Foundation, Thomas
Schatz from Citizens Against Government Waste, and Marc Joffe
from the Cato Institute.
Without objection, so ordered.

Statement of David Ditch, Senior Policy Analyst, Grover M. Hermann
Center for the Federal Budget, The Heritage Foundation, Submitted for
the Record by Hon. Scott Perry
Regional Commissions: Good Intentions, Bad Policy, Real Costs
My name is David Ditch. I am a Senior Policy Analyst at The
Heritage Foundation. The views I express in this testimony are my own
and should not be construed as representing any official position of
The Heritage Foundation.
This hearing represents something that ought to be commonplace:
Congress reviewing the activity of federal agencies. The bloat and
sprawl of the federal government means that too many programs and
bureaucracies operate with minimal oversight or consideration.
One factor behind this flawed approach is the prevailing (if
largely unspoken) view within the capital beltway that federal agencies
are indefinitely entitled to taxpayer resources. In turn, this means
that the burden of proof is overwhelmingly placed on critics of the
status quo.
Unless Congress changes course, the regional commissions will
likely spend $2 billion or more over the next decade.\1\ In the areas
covered by regional commissions, millions of full-time middle-class
workers earn around $50,000 a year. It would take the salaries of
40,000 such people--working thousands of hours apiece--to reach $2
billion. Accordingly, the burden of proof ought to be on supporters of
the regional commissions to show that they are worthy of so much
taxpayer sweat equity while diverting such a large amount of private
resources away from sustainable industry growth.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The problems covered in this testimony are not exclusive to the
regional commissions. However, the commissions are excellent examples
of many dysfunctions that have festered within the federal government
for decades.
Economic Development
Fundamentally, the regional commissions exist to promote economic
growth in areas with pockets of persistent poverty through the
provision of grants for infrastructure, business development,
education, and more. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC)
exemplifies this since parts of the region it covers have endured
economic struggles for generations.
In the 58 years since the ARC's founding, many states and regions
across the country have experienced dramatic and transformational
growth. From technology hubs on the west coast to oil and natural gas
production in the upper Midwest and gulf coast to broad-based growth in
the southeast, tens of millions of people have enjoyed wealth creation
and economic opportunity.
In contrast, much of the poverty that the ARC was created to
address remains. This is because a federal program cannot create
genuine, sustainable economic growth on its own. Factors such as
geography, social conditions, and state and local governance are not
matters of happenstance that can be solved with a federal grant--or
even decades of grants.
Meanwhile, the fact that some counties within the ARC's purview
have made economic progress does not constitute proof of the ARC's
effectiveness. Instead, it was primarily caused by hard work and smart
investments in the private sector. If anything, the uneven economic
results across the region demonstrate how little effect the ARC has.\2\

Legislators often seek to tout themselves as ``job creators,'' but
we now have centuries of proof that the best way to create jobs is
reducing the extent to which governments direct economic activity, not
the other way around.\3\ As such, regional commissions represent the
wrong approach to delivering prosperity.

Finally, it is worth noting that the ARC's most recent budget
justification highlights the closure of job-producing coal mines and
power plants in the region.\4\ The Biden Administration's agenda,
following the legacy of the Obama Administration, includes radical
regulatory impositions that would make things even worse.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Political Economic Development
Regional commissions are undeniably effective at providing one
thing in particular: political benefits. A grant enables officials at
the local, regional, state, and federal levels to issue press releases,
pose for pictures, and tout the ``benefit'' they are providing to
constituents (with taxpayer dollars).
The idea that these projects represent economic progress relies on
an economic fallacy referred to as the seen versus the unseen, where an
economic activity is obvious, but its cost is obscured.
For example, a local infrastructure project promoted by press
releases is highly visible to residents in the area. In contrast, we
are unable to see what might have happened with those funds had they
remained with the families and businesses whose tax payments
facilitated the project. If a particular grant funds a project or
activity of negligible value at the expense of productive household and
business investments, the country is left poorer as a result.
The idea that the federal government should have a limited set of
powers and responsibilities while most governance rests with lower
levels of government (currently known as federalism) was a core
principle of America's Founding. Regional commissions exemplify the
breakdown of discrete local, state, and federal government
responsibilities over the past century.\6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A local government would be best positioned to judge whether a new
sewer line or hiking trail is a good investment, since residents would
experience both the costs and the benefits. Introducing federal
subsidies distorts the process and incentivizes local officials to seek
funding for projects whose costs are greater than their value.\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Waste and Duplication
Perhaps the single most unavoidable flaw of regional commissions is
the extent to which the entirety of their work is duplicative of
efforts at all levels of government. This includes:

Long-standing state and local provision of infrastructure
for water and transportation;

Grants for drinking water infrastructure provided by the
Environmental Protection Agency and for transportation infrastructure
provided by the Department of Transportation;

The existence of the Rural Development bureau of the
Department of Agriculture, which has authority to provide grants for a
variety of economic development purposes;

The existence of the Community Development Fund in the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is a de facto slush
fund for local projects;

Business development support provided by the Small
Business Administration; and

Job training and educational programs operated by a
multitude of agencies, primarily in the Departments of Education and
Labor.

There is perhaps an argument to be made that regional commissions
allow for an approach that is more tailored to their communities than
one-size-fits-all nationwide programs. However, this would point
towards devolving most non-defense federal activity to the state and
local level rather than layering regional programs on top of nationwide
ones.
In addition to overlap, regional commissions also provide funding
for activities of more nebulous or dubious value, including tourism
promotion, arts and crafts, and conferences.\8\ Unfortunately, it is
difficult to gauge the total amount of funding dedicated to such
activities due to a lack of transparency, which is typical for federal-
to-local grant programs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Real Costs of Government
Regional commissions are part of a broader trend. In fiscal year
2022, the federal government transferred $1.2 trillion to state and
local governments. The scale of these transfers in both inflation-
adjusted terms and as a share of the economy has exploded since 1940
and now touches every aspect of local governance.\9\

\9\ Office of Management and Budget, Historical Table 12.1, https:/
/www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/historical-tables/ (accessed October 16,
2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even this understates the cost of federal grant programs, since
state and local governments employ cadres of bureaucrats to apply for
and administer grants. The more layers of government a project touches,
the larger the cost of bureaucracy. Further, this creates an ever-
growing gap between the government entity that raises revenue and the
government entity that spends the money, as well as between those who
pay for the project and those who benefit from it. This breaks an
important link whereby voters would traditionally limit government's
redirection of private resources.
More broadly, Congress is addicted to deficit spending.\10\ From
the start of the pandemic through the end of 2022, Washington went on a
$7.5 trillion spending spree or over $57,000 for every household in the
country.\11\ The national debt has surged to $33.5 trillion or roughly
$258,000 per household.\12\ Even darker fiscal clouds loom on the
horizon with $75 trillion in unfunded liabilities for Social Security
and Medicare.\13\

\13\ Ditch and Greszler, ``The End of Business as Usual.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The glut of deficit spending was a pivotal factor behind the wave
of inflation that began in 2021 and has still not fully receded. In
turn, the Federal Reserve has dramatically raised interest rates to
combat inflation, causing turmoil in the financial and housing sectors,
and, consequently, leading to slower and stagnating economic
growth.\14\ Relatedly, markets are demanding higher interest rates on
long-term federal debt, which will pose a lasting threat to economic
growth.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\14\ Ditch and Stern, ``The Road to Inflation.''
\15\ Ditch and Greszler, ``The End of Business as Usual.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
None of this is to say that regional commissions are the primary
cause of deficit spending. However, they are a perfect example of
Washington's inability to prioritize federal activity or to place the
national good ahead of special interests.
To prevent a catastrophic debt crisis Congress will need to put
Social Security and Medicare on firmer footing, ideally by slowing the
growth of spending.\16\ However, given the politically sensitive nature
of entitlement programs, this will require a massive undertaking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\16\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
With that in mind, a more reasonable first step to reduce the
deficit and make the federal government more manageable would be to
reduce the vast array of programs and bureaus that cater to niche
political concerns.
Recommendation
Congress should phase out and eliminate the regional commissions,
ideally within less than five years. This should take place in the
context of many related reforms, reductions, and eliminations to other
aspects of federal activity.
A smaller federal government that spends less and adds less (or
ideally nothing) to the national debt would be a tremendous benefit to
the entire country. More specifically, areas covered by the regional
commissions would be better off with less inflation and lower interest
rates than with more inflation and higher interest rates, but with a
small chance of getting a federal grant for their area.
America became the greatest country in the history of the world by
embracing freedom and opportunity. If we want to remain great, we must
exercise fiscal restraint rather than constantly looking to Washington
for handouts.
Thank you.

Statement of Thomas A. Schatz, President, Citizens Against Government
Waste, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Scott Perry
My name is Thomas A. Schatz, and I am president of Citizens Against
Government Waste (CAGW). CAGW was founded in 1984 by the late
industrialist J. Peter Grace and nationally-syndicated columnist Jack
Anderson to build support for implementation of the recommendations of
President Ronald Reagan's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control
(PSSCC), also known as the Grace Commission, and other waste-cutting
proposals. Since its inception, CAGW has been at the forefront of the
fight for efficiency, economy, and accountability in government. CAGW
has more than one million members and supporters nationwide, and since
1984 it has helped save taxpayers more than $2.4 trillion through the
implementation of Grace Commission findings and other recommendations.
In 2021, 61 percent of the organizations' combined income came from
individual contributors, while foundation and corporate contributors
accounted for the remaining 39 percent.
CAGW's mission reflects the interests of taxpayers. All citizens
benefit when government programs work cost-effectively, when deficit
spending is eliminated, and when government is held accountable. Not
only will representative government benefit from the pursuit of these
interests, but also the country will prosper economically because
government mismanagement, fiscal profligacy, and chronic deficits soak
up private savings and crowd out the private investment necessary for
long-term growth.
CAGW appreciates the committee's ongoing efforts to conduct its
oversight responsibility for regional commissions during today's
hearing, as well as your other legislative initiatives.
The federal government operates several independent agencies that
provide region-specific grants for infrastructure projects, economic
development, and local capacity building. These agencies and
commissions include the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta
Regional Authority, the Denali Commission and the Northern Border
Regional Commission. Each of former President Trump's budgets from
fiscal years (FY) 2018 through 2021 proposed the elimination of these
four agencies, stating that they are duplicative of other federal
programs. The FY 2021 budget noted that money for the three commissions
``is set aside for special geographical designations rather than
applied across the country based on objective criteria indicating local
areas' levels of distress.''
The Denali Commission, created by Congress in 1998 to build
infrastructure in rural Alaska, has been targeted for elimination by
multiple administrations. Former President Obama recommended
eliminating funding for the commission in his FY 2012 budget. His
administration argued that Denali projects are not funded through a
competitive or merit-based system, and that at least 29 other federal
programs could fulfill the commission's mandate. Denali Commission
Inspector General (IG) Mike Marsh stated in September 2013 that, ``I
have concluded that [my agency] is a congressional experiment that
hasn't worked out in practice. . . . I recommend that Congress put its
money elsewhere.''
A September 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report
found that the Denali Commission IG provided extremely limited
oversight of the commission's major programs during FYs 2011-2013.
According to the report, ``analysis of the 12 inspections completed by
the IG found that the IG provided oversight for $150,000 of the $167
million in grant funds disbursed during fiscal years 2011 through
2013.'' The amount of funding inspected by the IG added up to less than
1 percent of grants awarded by the Denali Commission over this period.
Given that the state of Alaska's oil revenues pay an annual
dividend to each resident of the state (in 2023, Alaskans will receive
$1,300 each), an additional subsidy is hard to justify. The
commission's statutory authorization expired on October 1, 2009. It is
time for the federal appropriation to disappear as well.
The Delta Regional Authority has also been frequently criticized.
In addition to being targeted for elimination by the Trump
administration, former President Obama's FY 2017 version of Cuts,
Consolidations, and Savings proposed a $3 million annual cut. Moreover,
each of the Republican Study Committee's budgets from FYs 2017 through
2024 called for the termination of regional commissions, noting that
they duplicate federal, state, and local programs.
Regular readers of CAGW's Congressional Pig Book know that these
programs have long been heavily earmarked. The Appalachian Regional
Commission has received 14 earmarks totaling $413.8 million since FY
1995 for projects in Alabama, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Since FY
2000, members of Congress have added 31 earmarks costing $343.1 million
for the Denali Commission, including Senate appropriator Lisa Murkowski
(R-Alaska), former Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska), and the late Sen. Ted
Stevens (R-Alaska) and Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska). Since FY 2003,
legislators have added 18 earmarks for the Delta Regional Authority
costing $177.9 million, including 14 earmarks costing $166.1 million
between FYs 2014 and 2021, during the supposed earmark moratorium.
These regional commissions and authorities are not only failing to
meet the needs of taxpayers, but also duplicating state and local
programs and wasting valuable resources that could be better used for
other purposes. CAGW recommends that they all should be eliminated.

My name is Marc Joffe, and I am a Federalism and State Policy
Analyst at the Cato Institute. I am writing to you today to provide
information and policy recommendations regarding the regional
commissions that are under the Subcommittee's purview.
The Congressional Research Service has identified eight regional
commissions and authorities.\1\ Some of these entities have little or
no public footprint. The Great Lakes Authority, established under the
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, does not appear to have
received any appropriations and has yet to begin operating.\2\ The
Northern Great Plains Regional Authority was created in 2002, but its
authorization lapsed at the end of FY2018. Finally, while the Southwest
Border Regional Commission has $5 million in authorized funding and a
confirmed federal co-chair, it does not appear to have a website, nor
does it have any grant information on usaspending.gov.

If a commission or authority is not active, it is clearly a
candidate for sunsetting. With the national debt now exceeding $33
trillion and large projected deficits over the coming decades, there is
no fiscal space for adding new programs.
The following chart provides summary funding information for the
six active commissions and authorities:

Source: Congressional Research Service. ARC's IIJA appropriation was $200 million per year for five years.

As the chart shows, most of these commissions received large
supplemental appropriations under the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act (IIJA). Since much of these appropriations remain unspent, the
commissions do not necessarily require FY 2024 appropriations to
maintain their grantmaking activity at prior year levels.
While terminating inactive entities and deferring future
appropriations should be seen as commonsense measures, that leaves the
bigger question of whether regional commissions and authorities are an
effective and equitable use of federal tax revenues.
There are other federal grant opportunities for communities in the
regional commission areas, so it is not clear that the commissions are
needed. For example, the IIJA provided $42.45 billion for a new state
broadband deployment program and an additional $2 billion for the
Department of Agriculture's rural broadband grant programs.\3\ Yet, the
Appalachian Regional Commission recently issued a $6.3 million grant to
a California-based nonprofit to help provide broadband across fifty
Appalachian communities.\4\

Small grantmaking agencies like regional commissions have two
disadvantages relative to their bigger peers: higher overheads and less
ability to professionalize selection and oversight processes. The
federal co-chair of each body is a level III appointee of the Executive
Schedule, entitled to a $195,000 salary plus benefits.\5\ Additional
staff can add significant extra costs. In its FY 2024 Congressional
Budget Justification, the Denali Regional Commission requested $3
million for personnel compensation and benefits, representing 18
percent of the $17 million appropriation it is seeking.\6\

In its 2022 Annual Financial Report, Denali's Inspector General
recommended that the Commission implement ``a framework to continually
assess, identify and monitor risk'' implying that no such framework
exists. In his response to the Inspector General, Federal Co-Chair
Garrett Boyle agreed that the ``long-term monitoring of grants is a
challenge,'' and noting that ``the fluctuating level of funds flowing
into the Commission makes it difficult to strike the exact right
balance between adequate staffing levels and over-staffing.'' \7\

Further, there is arguably an appearance of familial connections
and political considerations influencing the nomination and appointment
of federal co-chairs. This may inhibit the ability of commissions to
adequately implement risk controls.
Admittedly the goals of reducing overhead burden and improving
oversight could be achieved by consistently funding the Denali
Commission at a higher level, but that would be a poor use of taxpayer
funds given the small population positioned to benefit from the
Commission's grantmaking.
Alaska's population is 734,000, of which 541,000 live in the
state's four metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas.\8\ Thus,
the Commission's main purposes of supporting job training, economic
development, and infrastructure in Alaska rural areas \9\ are focused
on a population of less than 200,000 people.

In summary, regional commissions and authorities are an inefficient
and inequitable mechanism for distributing federal grant money to
disadvantaged communities. To the extent that their grantmaking
activities are deemed necessary, these activities can be easily
subsumed by other federal agencies and state governments.

TESTIMONY OF HON. GAYLE C. MANCHIN, FEDERAL COCHAIR,
APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION

Ms. Manchin. Thank you and good morning. I am Gayle
Manchin, and I am very proud to be here representing the
Appalachian Regional Commission as the Federal Cochair.
Since 1965, we have been reaching out to over 26 million
people, helping them gain parity with the rest of American
prosperity.
And we have been grateful over the years for the bipartisan
support from this committee that has enabled and empowered us
to strengthen our initiatives, that we have been able to
respond to the evolving needs of communities across
Appalachia's 423 counties and 13 States that stretch from
southern New York to northern Mississippi.
We have already been authorized for 5 years in the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. And so, this has
positioned us to help Appalachia and seize opportunities moving
forward.
We, of course, are not seeking any amendments to our
enabling legislation through the Appalachian Regional
Development Act.
It is important to note that the Appalachian region faces
specific challenges: the isolating mountainous range; the
dispersed population; the outdated or inadequate
infrastructure, which includes broadband, water, sewer, roads;
generational poverty; and the lack of capacity when it comes to
applying for and receiving assistance from other funding
opportunities.
ARC provides an effective approach for addressing the
region's unique challenges. Our flexible base funding program
takes a bottom-up approach, enabling local communities to
tailor the Federal assistance to their individual needs.
But then ARC works in collaboration with the States as a
partner to develop strategies from the local, State, and
Federal level so that we are meeting the priorities at each
level and not coming from the top telling them how to do it.
This bottom-up partnership approach ensures that the
initiatives reflect local, State, and Federal partnership. And
we believe that the base funding, which gives a formula-
allocated amount to each State, allows Governors, too, to have
a voice in funding opportunities.
In addition to the base program, ARC funds several grant
initiatives that are having transformative impacts across our
Appalachian region. This includes our POWER initiative, which
responds to job losses specifically due to coal-impacted
communities with the downturn of coal in those areas.
The Appalachian region has disproportionately suffered a
major shift as the coal industry went down. Over 70 percent of
coal mining jobs lost in the United States from 2011 to 2022
were in the Appalachian region, leading to a loss of more than
34,000 direct mining jobs.
Up to this time, ARC has invested more than $420 million
into 507 projects since POWER was established.
The Appalachian region also continues to be
disproportionately affected by the opioid epidemic. And so, in
2018 we organized. We formed listening committees, focus
groups. We studied and researched.
And as a result, we launched the INSPIRE grant, which is a
recovery-to-work initiative. So, training, not only the
recovery, but giving support across--in this investment, we
have given nearly $42 million across 126 INSPIRE projects.
And then last year, we launched our ARISE, which is a
multistate initiative to give greater impact as we respond to
the challenges as a region rather than as 13 individual States.
And then, through READY Appalachia, we have offered
capacity training to build our local leaders and our nonprofits
in a way that can strengthen their capacity in writing for
grants, strategizing, and planning for projects in their
communities.
So, we have undeniably seen progress in our region.
Highways have always been a key component. But in addition
to the concrete highways, we now find that the broadband
highway is another challenge in our mountainous isolated areas.
So, we continue to work to meet the challenges, targeting
our investments. We are a part of the White House Interagency
Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities where we
serve as a major member of that committee, working in tandem
with other Federal agencies. So, not to duplicate but to
complement one another in the funding that we are able to put
forth through those coal-impacted areas.
Our programs continue to work, they continue to thrive. We
look forward to hosting a time when the Appalachian regional
communities will not just thrive or survive, but they will
actually be able to compete with the rest of the country in
their efforts, and then we will know that we have reached
parity.
So, I thank you for this opportunity to speak before you,
and I look forward to answering any questions that you may have
that come up before us. Thank you very much.
[Ms. Manchin's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Gayle C. Manchin, Federal Cochair,
Appalachian Regional Commission
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:
My name is Gayle Manchin, Federal Co-Chair of the Appalachian
Regional Commission (ARC), and I am pleased to come before you this
morning to discuss the progress that ARC has made in helping close the
socioeconomic gap between Appalachia's 26 million people and the rest
of the nation.
ARC has been grateful for the bipartisan support from this
committee over the years. You have helped us strengthen our initiatives
and ensure that we are able to respond to the evolving needs of
communities across Appalachia's 423 counties and 13 states. We were
reauthorized for five years in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act, and this has positioned us to help Appalachia seize the economic
opportunities of the future. We are not seeking any amendments to our
enabling legislation, the Appalachian Regional Development Act.
Since 1965, the ARC has collaborated with local and state partners
to create jobs, build infrastructure, and strengthen the regional
economy. ARC provides an effective approach for addressing the region's
economic challenges and advancing each of our strategic investment
priorities: 1.) building Appalachian businesses, 2.) building
Appalachia's workforce ecosystem, 3.) building Appalachia's
infrastructure, 4.) building regional culture and tourism, and 5.)
building community leaders and capacity.
Our flexible base funding program takes a ``bottom up'' approach,
enabling local communities to tailor the federal assistance to their
individual needs. It makes use of local development districts to
develop and implement effective strategies for local economic
development. Through our federal-state partnership structure, ARC's
projects reflect state priorities as well.
Since ARC was founded, it has made considerable progress to move
Appalachia closer to the nation's economic mainstream. For example:

The number of high-poverty counties in Appalachia has
been cut by over 60 percent.\1\

half.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The percentage of adults with a high school diploma has
nearly tripled since 1960, and students in Appalachia now graduate from
high school at nearly the same rate as that of the nation as a
whole.\3\

In the past five years, ARC-funded infrastructure
projects have provided 251,890 Appalachian households with access to
clean water and sanitation facilities.\4\

ARC program investments totaled $867.3 million from FY 2018 to FY
2022. Taken together these funds--

leveraged over $1.4 billion in other public investment
($1.63 per $1 ARC investment);

attracted over $5.5 billion in private investment ($6.35
per $1 ARC investment);

resulted in 113,483 jobs being created or retained; and

provided training and new skills to 172,403 students and
workers/trainees.\5\

In addition to our base funding program, which has been the
mainstay of ARC over the years, and in which funds are allocated by
formula to each ARC state for the Governor to recommend projects to us,
I want to highlight for the committee three special initiatives that
are positioning our communities to be competitive in the new economy:
The first is our regionally competitive Partnerships for
Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization Initiative
(POWER) initiative for coal-impacted communities. POWER responds to job
losses in coal mining, coal-fired power plant operations, and supply
chain and logistics businesses that serve that industry.
Appalachia has disproportionately suffered from the shift away from
coal as an energy source. Over 70 percent of the coal mining jobs lost
in the United States from 2011 to 2022 were in the Appalachian region.
Since POWER's establishment in 2015, ARC has invested over $420 million
in 507 projects impacting nearly 400 of Appalachia's coal-impacted
counties. These ARC's investments are projected to create or retain
more than 53,000 jobs and prepare over 142,000 workers and students for
new opportunities in entrepreneurship, broadband, tourism, and other
growing industries.
The next initiative I'll highlight is called Investments Supporting
Partnerships In Recovery Ecosystems (INSPIRE), which focuses on
creating or expanding local substance use disorder (SUD) networks that
lead to workforce entry or re-entry. In 2018, your committee recognized
the way SUD was ravaging our region and you added a new authority to
our statute for us to do work in this area. We created a substance use
advisory council, convened a series of listening sessions around the
region and launched INSPIRE as a result.
Successful projects support the post-treatment to employment
continuum, which could include investments in healthcare networks that
support SUD recovery professionals, recovery-focused job training
programs, as well as initiatives designed to coordinate, or link,
recovery services and training that support the recovery to work
ecosystem, among others.
Substance use disorder poses a major threat to the economic
prosperity of Appalachia. It's not just a public health and public
safety issue; it's an economic development issue. It drains the
region's resources, both human and financial.
Since April 2021 when INSPIRE was created, ARC has invested nearly
$42 million in 126 projects that address Appalachia's SUD crisis in 349
counties--which is 83 percent of the region. Together, these projects
are projected to improve more than 2,178 businesses and provide
opportunities for nearly 9,772 students and workers in creating or
expanding recovery ecosystems leading to workforce entry or re-entry
throughout the region.
Our newest initiative is ARISE (Appalachian Regional Initiative for
Stronger Economies), which is funded by the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act and which seeks to drive large-scale, regional economic
transformation through multi-state collaborative projects across
Appalachia. ARISE rests on the premise that greater economic impact can
occur from activities that are coordinated across state lines than
would likely occur when these activities are conducted in isolation in
individual states. It gives ARC a way to boost economic sectors or
industry clusters that reach across multiple states, yielding greater
economic payoff for the economies of those states. ARISE grants are
strengthening the electric vehicle sector in our southern states, the
textile industry in the Carolinas, green manufacturing in northern
Appalachia, and regional tourism in Central Appalachia.
Since launching ARISE last fall, we have made 13 grants totaling
$48.6 million. We currently have 36 applications under review and have
invited 14 more to apply.
Doing this kind of multi-state work is not easy; it calls for all
of us to think differently about how we build a stronger regional
economy. But I've been very encouraged by what our first year of
experience with ARISE has produced. It is changing the conversation
about economic development, and it is driving home the benefits of
partnerships that reach broadly across multiple states.
Although Appalachia has seen progress as a result of ARC's program
and initiatives, serious challenges constrain the economic future of
too many Appalachians.

Nearly one-fifth of Appalachia's counties still suffer
from persistent and severe economic distress.\6\

percent lower than the nation in 2021.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ https://www.arc.gov/distressed-designation-and-county-economic-
status-classification-system/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The region has been disproportionately affected by the
loss of manufacturing jobs. During the period 2000-2021, Appalachia had
a net loss of 625,000 manufacturing jobs (a 31 percent decline), while
the United States lost around 4.7 million (a 26 percent decline).\8\

Roughly 20 percent of the region's population is not
served by a community water system (compared with 12 percent of the
rest of the nation's population), and 47 percent of Appalachian
households are not served by a public sewage system (compared with 24
percent nationally).\9\

So there is still much work to be done.
In addition to leveraging our base funding program and special
initiatives as mentioned previously, ARC tackles Appalachia's
challenges by targeting its resources to the areas of greatest need,
leveraging private resources into Appalachia, and partnering with other
federal agencies to extend the reach of their resources into
Appalachia.
In FY 2022, 74 percent of ARC's grant dollars supported projects
that primarily or substantially benefited economically distressed
counties and areas.
ARC is not duplicative, but rather complementary, of other federal
programs. By using its grassroots delivery system, ARC can extend the
reach of programs into some of the most economically distressed parts
of the nation by providing the necessary training and gap funding to
prepare economically distressed communities to compete successfully for
funding from national programs.
Similarly, ARC helps attract private sector investment to areas
that otherwise would not likely be considered competitive investment
opportunities. In FY 2022, investments of $239.7 million in grant funds
across all ARC initiatives attracted an additional $389.5 million in
other project funding, an investment ratio of 2 to 1, and $1.57 billion
in non-project leveraged private investment, a ratio of 7 to 1.
As previously mentioned, partnerships lie in the heart of how ARC
is able to advance the economic health of the region. That's just as
true in working with other federal agencies as it is in collaborations
with the private and nonprofit sectors. ARC has strong relationships
with U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Economic Development
Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the Federal
Communications Commission, and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency. We have a history of collaborating with federal agencies to
achieve greater impact in Appalachia.
ARC is a leading member of the White House Interagency Working
Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization,
spotlighting for the 11 member agencies the particular challenges that
many Appalachian communities face because of the decline in the coal
industry.
Highways have always been a key component of the effort to narrow
the economic gap between Appalachia and the rest of the nation. The
Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) was created to connect
Appalachia to national and international markets and to compensate for
the fact that the interstate system had bypassed much of the region.
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provides dedicated
funding of $250 million a year for work on the ADHS. IIJA also sets
aside 25 percent of the funding for the Rural Surface Transportation
Grant Program for the ADHS, which totals $500 million over five years.
This will facilitate significant progress in completing the system,
which is currently 91 percent under construction or open to traffic.
While the current funding for the ADHS goes to the Federal Highway
Administration, ARC maintains an active role in overseeing the system.
ARC's program also helps fund reliable and affordable broadband
infrastructure to rural Appalachian communities so they can compete and
participate in the global economy. We have partnered with the Federal
Communications Commission to help more Appalachians participate in the
Affordable Connectivity Program, which helps reduce barriers by
providing eligible households with up to $30 per month to help cover
internet bills.
However, we often hear from communities that they lack the capacity
to take full advantage of ARC's resources or the funding opportunities
at other federal agencies. In response, ARC has created READY
Appalachia, which seeks to build capacity in four key pillars of
economic and community development: nonprofit organizations, community
foundations, local development districts, and local governments. We
launched this program last year.
Congress and the Biden-Harris Administration have made historic
levels of funding available to communities across Appalachia--funding
that will be used to support sustainable economic growth. By helping
local leaders and nonprofit organizations to build on their capacity to
develop infrastructure projects and workforce development initiatives
in our communities, READY Appalachia will also help increase equity for
our Appalachian people and ensure that the region's resilience and
success will transform their future.
ARC's emphasis on local building capacity, in addition to our
POWER, INSPIRE, and ARISE programs, will complement ARC's traditional
base funding program that advances basic infrastructure, workforce
development, and business support.
I like to say that the name of our agency isn't the ``13 States of
Appalachia''; it's the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the more we
can do things on a truly regional, multistate basis the greater the
benefits will be for Appalachia and for the Appalachia states. If the
Appalachian part of the state gets stronger, the whole state will get
stronger, and the stronger the ARC states become, the stronger our
national economy will be. Taken together, ARC's program and initiatives
will help narrow the economic gap between Appalachia and the rest of
the nation. I look forward to working with the Subcommittee in this
effort.

Mr. Ezell [presiding]. Thank you, Ms. Manchin.
And, Dr. Wiggins, you are recognized for 5 minutes for your
testimony.

TESTIMONY OF HON. COREY WIGGINS, Ph.D., FEDERAL COCHAIR, DELTA
REGIONAL AUTHORITY

Mr. Wiggins. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, my
name is Dr. Corey Wiggins. I serve as the Federal Cochairman of
the Delta Regional Authority. Thank you for allowing me the
opportunity to share with you the important work of the Delta
Regional Authority.
Since its establishment in 2000, the DRA's purpose has
remained unchanged: to promote and encourage economic
development in the DRA region.
DRA's financial assistance programs provide targeted
investments in the 252 counties and parishes across our eight-
State region. That includes parts of Alabama, Arkansas,
Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and
Tennessee.
While home to 10 million residents, the DRA region is among
the most economically distressed parts of the United States.
The DRA invests in a broad range of initiatives that
support four overarching goals, including investing in public
infrastructure, developing the local workforce, promoting
business growth and entrepreneurship, and supporting
sustainable communities.
Some highlights of DRA programs and their impacts include,
from 2017 to 2022, project investments in the States' Economic
Development Assistance Program, our partnership program with
our Governors, resulted in over 500,000 families affected by
infrastructure programs, more than 160,000 individuals trained
in workforce development programs, and approximately 35,000
jobs created or retained in the region.
Since 2017, our Community Infrastructure Fund, which
supports basic public infrastructure investments, resulted in
more than 290,000 families affected by improved infrastructure
projects, about 1,500 individuals trained in workforce
programming, and over 8,000 jobs created or retained in the
region.
DRA invested a total of over $46 million in funding in the
DRA region in fiscal year 2022. The expected impact of this
funding from nearly 110 projects in the region includes nearly
42,000 families affected via improved infrastructure, over
1,800 jobs created or retained, and over 1,200 individuals
trained.
As DRA continues to assess its fiscal year 2023 project and
impact data, some highlighted regional investments include: DRA
awarded $11.7 million in investments to 28 projects in the
region through our Delta Workforce Program.
DRA also awarded over $600,000 to five communities in
Illinois, Louisiana, and Missouri in its first round of funding
through the Strategic Planning Grant Program, a new initiative
to support capacity building in the region.
Every 5 years, DRA, by statute, is responsible for creating
a regional development plan with public input that is approved
by our Governors. In February 2023, the authority approved and
released ``Navigating the Currents of Opportunity: DRA Regional
Development Plan IV.''
Our strategic goals for the next 5 years include: DRA will
expand and invest in the resiliency of the region's public
infrastructure to improve residents' quality of life and
increase economic opportunity.
We will improve the networks of agencies, organizations,
businesses, and educational institutions providing workforce
development opportunities.
We will strengthen the competitiveness of the region's
employers, attract new employers to the region, and support the
long-term growth of micro and small businesses.
We will expand our efforts to enhance sustainable and
inclusive local placemaking, quality of life, and community
capacity.
DRA has pursued its vision of the region as a place where
people and businesses have access to economic opportunities and
vibrant, sustainable, and resilient communities.
One of DRA's legislative priorities includes
reauthorization of the agency, which has been included in the
farm bill in the past. It is vitally important that the agency
continues to exist and provide critical resources to the heart
of America.
Additionally, the agency requests appropriations language
to amend DRA's authorizing statute to remove section 382N of
the Delta Regional Authority Act of 2000, thereby deleting or
removing DRA's sunset language.
DRA and its sister commissions serve a distinguished
purpose and uniquely critical role within each of our regions.
Our impact in the region is not just limited to the
quantitative outputs from the agency investments, but is also
connected to DRA's reputation as a regional partner working
closely with local governments and local development districts
to help find solutions to the challenges experienced in the
region.
It is critical that DRA remains a vital partner in the
region to foster inclusive communities, strengthen regional
collaboration, achieve sustained long-term economic
development, and produce meaningful opportunities for all
people in the DRA region.
Again, thank you for allowing me to speak today. I look
forward to our continued conversation.
[Mr. Wiggins' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Corey Wiggins, Ph.D., Federal Cochair,
Delta Regional Authority
On behalf of the Delta Regional Authority (DRA), I am pleased to
present the Delta Regional Authority's Written Testimony Regarding
Regional Commissions: A Review of Federal Economic Development Program
Effectiveness.
Since its establishment in 2000, the agency's purpose has remained
unchanged--to promote and encourage economic development in the DRA
region. DRA's financial assistance programs provide targeted investment
in the 252 counties and parishes within eight states in and around the
Mississippi River Delta and the Alabama Black Belt. Member states are
Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Missouri, and Tennessee.
While home to 10 million residents, the DRA region is among the
most economically distressed parts of the United States. Among the DRA
region's 252 counties and parishes, most are characterized as
distressed and persistently in poverty \1\ \2\. Despite these economic
conditions, millions of Americans across the country rely on the DRA
region for agriculture, manufacturing, textiles, and supply chain
logistics, as well as natural resources.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ As of FY 2022, 230 (91 percent) of DRA's counties and parishes
are economically distressed. In compliance with the statute, the DRA
calculates distress criteria on an annual basis. To be deemed
distressed counties and parishes must meet the following criteria: (1)
An unemployment rate of one percent higher than the national average
for the most recent 24-month period. (2) Have a per capita income of 80
percent or less of the most recent national per capita income level.
\2\ As of FY 2022, 136 (54 percent) of DRA's counties and parishes
are in persistent poverty. The DRA follows the definition of persistent
poverty provided by the USDA Economic Research Service that designates
a county or parish may experience persistent poverty if it has poverty
rates of 20 percent of the population, or more, for at least 30 years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout its history, DRA has responded effectively to the
region's challenges through its programs and investments. The DRA
invests in a broad range of initiatives that support the four
overarching goals of the DRA: investing in public infrastructure,
developing local workforces, promoting business growth and
entrepreneurship, and supporting sustainable communities. Some
highlights of DRA programs and their impact include:

The States' Economic Development Assistance Program
(SEDAP), one of DRA's main investment tools, provides direct
investments for basic public infrastructure, transportation
infrastructure, business development, and workforce development. From
2017 to 2022, project investments in SEDAP resulted in over 504,000
families affected by infrastructure projects, about 164,000 individuals
trained in workforce development programs, and approximately 35,000
jobs either created or retained in the region.

The Community Infrastructure Fund (CIF) supports projects
that address flood control, basic public infrastructure, and
transportation infrastructure improvements. Since 2017, CIF investments
have facilitated nearly 299,000 families affected by infrastructure
projects, about 1,500 individuals trained in workforce programming, and
over 8,000 jobs created or retained in the region.

The Delta Doctors program increases access to quality
health care in DRA communities by using a J-1 visa waiver to allow
foreign physicians trained in the United States to work in areas with a
shortage of health professionals. From 2019 to 2021, the DRA sponsored
440 physicians across the region, with about half of projects taking
place in Alabama and Louisiana. About 25 percent of DRA-sponsored
doctors work in a primary care role, with the remainder working across
more than 18 specialties.

In collaboration with the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), the Delta Region Community Health Systems
Development Program enhances healthcare delivery by providing technical
assistance to critical access hospitals, small rural hospitals, rural
health clinics, and other healthcare organizations. From 2017 to 2021,
the program supported 43 organizations (37 hospitals, five Rural Health
Clinics, and one Federally Qualified Health Center) in 40 DRA
communities across all eight DRA states. A total of approximately
73,220 county jobs were supported due to hospital and clinic employee
spending (2017-2021), which represents about 19 percent of all local
jobs in these communities.

DRA is essential to economic development in the 252 counties and
parishes within our eight-state region. As noted by the Southern
Economic Advancement Project, ``[t]he economic conditions within the
Delta and the Black Belt regions continue to negatively impact the
lives of the people there and the nation's overall economic health.''
\3\ The investments made via DRA for basic public infrastructure,
transportation infrastructure, business development, and workforce
development are vital to the economic development of these areas.

Additionally, as stated in the Congressional Research Service
Report: Federal Regional Commissions and Authorities: Structural
Features and Function dated April 7, 2023,\4\ DRA, along with other
commissions, ``provide[s] a model of functioning economic development
approaches that are place-based, intergovernmental, and multifaceted in
their programmatic orientation (e.g., infrastructure, energy,
environment/ecology, workforce, business development).''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
An example of this approach can be highlighted in the demand for
DRA's programs in FY 2022. Historically, DRA's appropriations have been
around $30 million. However, the agency received a one-time $150
million appropriation in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, or the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. By combining DRA's annual
appropriations and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, DRA invested
a total of over $46 million in funding in the DRA region in FY 2022.
The expected impact of this funding for nearly 110 projects in the
region includes nearly 42,000 families affected via improved access to
infrastructure, over 1,800 jobs created or retained, and over 1,200
individuals trained.
One of the FY 2022 projects included a DRA Community Infrastructure
Fund investment of $414,915 to Independence County, Arkansas. The
investment funded two county-owned roads which were necessary to access
the property utilized by American Stave Company. DRA funding was
leveraged by the county to help execute the $23 million investment of
private capital. American Stave is an international company established
in 1912 and is the largest barrel maker in the world. The new stave
mill will be the company's seventh domestic mill and an important
addition to the supply of high-quality American white oak. The
investment is helping to create 45 new jobs in an area where the
poverty rate is nearly five percentage points higher than the national
average (17.1 percent and 12.6 percent, respectively), and a higher
unemployment rate compared to the national average (4.3 percent and 5.4
percent, respectively).\5\

As DRA continues to assess FY 2023 project and impact data, some
highlighted regional investments include:

DRA awarded $11.7 million in investments to 28 projects
in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Missouri, and Tennessee through the Delta Workforce Grant Program
(DWP). One of those investments included $450,000 to the Green River
Area Development District to support a water and wastewater operator
apprenticeship program serving residents in the Green River region of
Western Kentucky.

DRA awarded $630,400 to five communities in Illinois,
Louisiana, and Missouri in its first round of funding through the
Strategic Planning Program, including $150,000 to the Alexander-Cairo
Port District located in Southern Illinois. The funding will be
utilized to develop a master plan that will identify the scope for port
development and the future of the riverport.

DRA awarded a $3,539,000 investment that will boost
economic development and improve the quality of life for current and
future businesses and residents surrounding the BlueOval City
automotive complex near Stanton, Tennessee. BlueOval City is Ford's
largest, most advanced auto production complex in its history and will
be home to the next-generation electric truck from Ford. Funding from
this project is provided by the Community Infrastructure Fund. The
investment will be matched by $8,140,000 in additional funds from U.S.
Department of Agriculture Rural Development. The Town of Stanton
investment project will provide water and sewer utility services to
facilities critical to BlueOval City. The project is expected to create
2,700 direct jobs and over 3,300 indirect jobs.

Every five years, the DRA, by statute, is responsible for creating
a regional development plan with public input that is approved by our
board of governors. In February 2023, the Authority approved and
released Navigating the Currents of Opportunity: DRA Regional
Development Plan IV. This plan is not just a statement of our
priorities but a driver of the actions we have begun to embark on to
capitalize on tremendous opportunities, focus on rural and distressed
communities, and strengthen regional economic development. DRA's
strategic goals reflect the Authority's fourfold commitment to
advancing infrastructure, job creation, business expansion, and local
economies. Our strategic goals for the next five years include:

DRA will expand and invest in the resiliency of the
region's public infrastructure to improve residents' quality of life
and increase economic opportunity.

DRA will improve networks of agencies, organizations,
businesses, and educational institutions providing workforce
development opportunities. It will promote access to services, funding,
and programs that enable career stability.

DRA will strengthen the competitiveness of the region's
employers, attract new employers to the region, and support the long-
term growth of micro and small businesses.

DRA will expand efforts to enhance sustainable and
inclusive local placemaking, quality of life, and community capacity.

A part of DRA's commitment to build upon these priorities to expand
its impact in the region includes outreach to DRA stakeholders,
including local governments, nonprofit organizations, local development
districts, community colleges and four-year institutions of higher
learning. Some of these outreach and technical assistance efforts have
included:

Technical assistance and capacity-building training for
Local Development Districts (LDD). In 2023, DRA conducted ten in-person
and one virtual LDD training.

Technical assistance and capacity-building training for
the Workforce Opportunity for Rural Communities (WORC) Initiative,
which is a partnership between the U.S. Department of Labor Employment
and Training Administration, the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC),
the DRA, and the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC), that funds
grant projects within the Appalachian, Lower Mississippi Delta, and
Northern Border regions. In 2023, DRA conducted one in-person Pre-
Technical Assistance training opportunity in Alexandria, Louisiana, for
potential applicants applying for the WORC grant with over 80 attendees
and one virtual Pre-Technical Assistance training opportunity.

DRA has pursued its vision of the region as a place where people
and businesses have access to economic opportunities in vibrant,
sustainable, and resilient communities. To realize this vision, DRA has
embraced its mission of applying innovative ideas and strategies to
foster inclusive communities, strengthen regional collaboration, and
achieve sustained economic development. One of DRA's recent initiatives
in meeting these regional needs includes the Delta Revitalization
through Innovation, Vision, and Equity (DRIVE) initiative in
partnership with the University of Memphis Division of Research and
Innovation. This project aims to support capacity building in selected
small rural communities. DRIVE serves as a key component in the DRA-
supported research initiatives centered on economic and workforce
development, economic recovery, transportation infrastructure, water
and wastewater infrastructure, digital infrastructure, capacity
building, business development and entrepreneurship.
DRA's priority for reauthorization, which has been included in the
Farm Bill in the past, is to continue to exist to provide critical
resources to the heart of America. Additionally, it is important for
the agency to seek out opportunities to improve upon its execution of
its mission through amendments to its authorizing statute.
The 2024 Budget included the following two proposals to amend DRA's
authorizing statute:

Adding ``Indian Tribes'' to Eligible Entities
We propose an amendment to expressly include ``tribes'' in DRA's
statute as an eligible entity. This amendment would be made,
specifically and exclusively, to 7 U.S. Code Section 2009aa-2 Economic
and Community Development Grants.

Amend,

``(a) In General, The Authority may approve grants to States and
public and nonprofit entities for projects, approved in accordance with
section 2009aa-8 of this title'' to read ``The Authority may approve
grants to States and local governments, Indian tribes, and public and
nonprofit organizations for projects, approved in accordance with
section 2009aa-8 of this title''

Expand Grantmaking Language to align with other
Commissions.
We would like to add grantmaking language to align with the
language of other regional commissions, including Southeast Crescent
Regional Commission, Southwest Border Regional Commission, and Northern
Border Regional Commission.

The proposed amendment would be the addition of the following
``new'' language as subparagraphs:
(5)  to provide assistance to severely economically distressed
and underdeveloped areas of its region that lack financial resources
for improving basic health care and other public services;
(6)  to promote resource conservation, tourism, recreation, and
preservation of open space in a manner consistent with economic
development goals;
(7)  to promote the development of renewable and alternative
energy sources; Causing renumeration of current subparagraph (5) to
(8).

In addition, the 2024 Budget included two legislative proposals
through appropriations language:

Allow User Fees.
DRA requests authority to collect and spend discretionary user
fees in conjunction with the Delta Doctors J-1 Visa Program. Consistent
with Government Accountability Office (GAO) Redbook guidance on user
fees, collections may only be spent on the cost to operate the visa
program and may not be used to offset other agency programs or
operations. The agency should set and announce the user fee for public
comment consistent with the GAO Redbook.

The Delta Doctors Program increases the number of doctors
serving Delta residents. The program allows foreign physicians who are
trained in the United States to work in medically underserved areas for
three years by providing those physicians with J-1 Visa Waivers.
Participants in the Delta Doctors program do not take jobs away from
U.S.-born physicians. Instead, they provide services in areas where
there would otherwise be a shortage of physicians. The impact of Delta
Doctors in the region can be realized by the access to quality
affordable healthcare and the economic impact the doctors make on the
community in which they reside and practice. On average, each ``Delta
Doctor'' is estimated to create five full-time jobs within their
clinics and offices, and an additional 3.4 full and part-time jobs
within the communities where they work.

Under the proposed authority, DRA would collect user fees from
health care institutions and spend the collections on the operation and
staffing of the Delta Doctors Program.

Deletion of sunsetting provision.
DRA requests appropriations language to amend DRA's authorizing
statute to remove section 382N of the Delta Regional Authority Act of
2000. Currently, DRA continues to fulfill its mission notwithstanding
the sunset clause because prior year appropriations language included a
provision that allows the agency to continue to operate as long as it
continues to have such funding available.

DRA and its sister commissions serve a distinguished purpose and
uniquely critical role within each of our regions. DRA's impact in the
region is not just limited to the quantitative outputs from the
agency's investments, but it is also connected to DRA's reputation as a
regional partner working closely with local governments and local
development districts to help find solutions to the challenges
experienced in the region. It is critical that DRA remains a vital
partner in the region to foster inclusive communities, strengthen
regional collaboration and productive capacity, achieve sustained,
long-term economic development, and produce meaningful opportunities
for all people in the DRA region.

Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Dr. Wiggins.
Mr. Saunders, you are recognized for 5 minutes for your
testimony.

TESTIMONY OF HON. CHRIS SAUNDERS, FEDERAL COCHAIR, NORTHERN
BORDER REGIONAL COMMISSION

Mr. Saunders. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Titus, members
of the subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to appear
before you today to discuss the impactful work of the Northern
Border Regional Commission.
This fall marks the 15th anniversary of the creation of our
commission by Congress as part of the 2008 farm bill. And
thanks to the continued investment and support of Congress,
NBRC has quickly matured into a significant contributor to the
economic development ecosystem in the northern border region.
As the NBRC was modeled on the Appalachian Regional
Commission and the Delta Regional Authority, it should come as
no surprise that everything the commission does is rooted in
partnership. We bring together the Federal Government and the
leadership of our member States to utilize a regional lens to
invest public dollars in local communities. This model doesn't
just invite collaboration but requires it.
We believe the ways in which we put this model into
practice we are fulfilling the vision laid out by Congress to
serve as an integrator of resources and a collaborator between
all levels of Government.
The commission is staffed by a dedicated team of
professionals who live and work in the communities they serve
and apply their knowledge and experience to shape the
commission's programs and operations.
Guiding this work is a vision that at its core, the mission
of the NBRC is to build vibrant, rural communities and provide
for the well-being of the residents that live there.
We put this vision into practice in a variety of different
ways, such as centering the needs of rural communities. The
regional commission model was designed around the origination
of projects at the local level. And we are pleased to share
that in our latest grant round, of the 66 awards made, more
than half were made to communities under 5,000 people. And just
under half were made to communities that were first-time
applicants to NBRC.
We embrace the drivers of regional and local economies. The
core of our territory is shaped by an ecological zone that is
known as the Northern Forest, and that forest has experienced
significant disruptions over the past three decades.
Supporting the communities as they determine what the
future of a forest economy means to them is a cornerstone of
the commission's work. In some communities, this has meant
supporting innovation in the wood products industry, while
helping others to diversify their economies by investing in
outdoor recreation infrastructure.
As you have heard from my peers, many of our rural
communities need significant investment in infrastructure. And
I am pleased to share that as part of our Catalyst awards this
summer, which is in part funded by the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act, 50 percent of our awards were made to
projects classified as infrastructure.
We know that NBRC is very effective at leveraging other
sources of funding. The commission has a strong track record of
supporting projects that incorporate other funding sources. In
fact, it is required in our project awards. And in this most
recent round, our funds were matched at a nearly 1-to-4 ratio,
turning $40 million of Federal investment into a total
investment of $200 million across the region.
NBRC is also addressing the capacity gap in rural areas.
A limiting factor on many of our small communities to
participate in Federal grant programs is a lack of access to
capacity, namely people and organizations who play a critical
role in the planning, development, and execution of economic
development initiatives.
The commission operates a State capacity program that is
authorized in statute that builds human capacity at the
statewide level and at local organizations and technical
assistance providers.
Similar to ARC and DRA, we are responsive to emerging
needs. The commission evaluates what role it should play in
addressing obstacles that limit economic opportunity in rural
areas. And increasingly, housing and access to healthcare have
emerged as barriers to growth. We are actively considering how
best to leverage our resources in order to complement, not
replicate, the work of other agencies in this area.
Each of these points illustrates a way in which the
commission is maximizing its unique structure as a regional
agency to the benefit of rural areas.
As I have noted, all our work is rooted in partnership, and
we see Congress as a key collaborator in determining the
commission's priorities.
Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of Representatives
introduced H.R. 4188, the Northern Border Regional Commission
Reauthorization Act, and this bill has been cosponsored by
nearly every Member of Congress from districts representing
counties included in the commission territory.
We appreciate the work that has gone into drafting this
legislation and its companion bill in the Senate.
We look forward to working with Congress, and I am pleased
to answer questions regarding the commission's work to better
our region.
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I look
forward to your questions.
[Mr. Saunders' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Chris Saunders, Federal Cochair,
Northern Border Regional Commission
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Titus, Members of the Subcommittee,
thank you for the invitation to appear before the Subcommittee today to
discuss the impactful work of the Northern Border Regional Commission
(NBRC).
This fall marks the fifteenth anniversary of the creation of our
Commission by Congress as part of the 2008 Farm Bill. Thanks to the
continued investment and support of Congress, NBRC has quickly matured
into a significant contributor to the economic development ecosystem in
the Northern Border Region.
As the NBRC was modeled on the Appalachian Regional Commission and
the Delta Regional Authority, it will come as no surprise that
everything the Commission does is rooted in partnership. We bring
together the federal government and the leadership of our member states
to utilize a regional lens to invest public dollars in local
communities.
This model doesn't just invite collaboration, but requires it. We
believe that in the ways in which we put this model into practice, we
are fulfilling the vision laid out by Congress to serve as an
integrator of resources and a collaborator between all levels of
government; be they municipal, county, state or federal. The Commission
is staffed by a dedicated team of professionals, who live and work in
the communities they serve, and apply their knowledge and experience to
shape the Commission's programs and operations.
Guiding this work is a vision that at its core, the mission of the
NBRC is to build vibrant rural communities and provide for the well-
being of the residents who live there. We put this vision into practice
in a variety of different ways such as:

Centering the needs of rural communities--The regional
commission model is designed around the origination of projects at the
local level. That is no different in the NBRC territory where we
maintain a network of Local Development Districts that collaborate with
municipalities and non-profits to develop and submit applications to
the Commission for funding. The Commission continues to look for ways
to prioritize delivering our funds to rural communities. We are pleased
to share that in our latest grant round, of the 66 awards made, more
than half were made to communities with under 5,000 people and just
under half were made to communities who were first time NBRC
applicants.\1\

NBRC%202023%20Catalyst%20Grant
%20Awards%20Press%20Release%20-%20August%202023%20FINAL.pdf

Embracing drivers of regional and local economies--The
core of the Commission's territory is shaped by an ecological zone
known as the Northern Forest. Stretching across Northern Maine, New
Hampshire, Vermont, and New York, the area represents one of the most
densely forested regions in the country and at 26 million acres is the
largest continuous forest east of the Mississippi. The economy and
settlement patterns of the region were both shaped and defined by
timber harvesting and paper making for nearly two centuries. The forest
economy has experienced serious disruptions over the past three decades
and supporting communities as they determine what the future of a
forest economy means to them is a cornerstone of the Commission's work.
In some communities this is supporting the commercialization of cross
laminated timber utilizing local species such as hemlock, new wood
fiber-based businesses such as new forms of insulation, or the
residential and institutional conversion to modern wood heat. Other
communities aim to diversify their local economy with many investing in
their natural assets and outdoor recreation infrastructure.
Accordingly, NBRC has recognized these areas as regional priorities,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
and developed programs focused on supporting these industries.

Investing in infrastructure--Like many rural areas, our
territory needs investment in public infrastructure that will
facilitate additional private and public investments. Congress has
recognized this should be a priority funding area for NBRC, stipulating
in our statute that a minimum of 40 percent of our grant awards should
be made to infrastructure projects. NBRC meets and exceeds this
threshold with its investments across the region on an annual basis. In
our latest round of Catalyst awards, which is funded in part by the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), 57 percent were made to
projects classified as infrastructure.

Leveraging other sources of funding--While NBRC requires
a local match for its funding, the Commission has a strong track record
of supporting projects that incorporate other funding sources. In
NBRC's most recent Catalyst round, our funds were matched at a nearly
1:4 ratio, turning $43.6 million of NBRC funding into $208.5 million in
total investment across our four-state region.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Id.

Addressing the capacity gap in rural areas--A limiting
factor on the ability of many small communities to participate in
federal grant programs is a lack of access to capacity, namely people
and organizations who play a critical role in the planning,
development, and execution of economic development initiatives. The
Commission operates a State Capacity Grant program as authorized in
statute, that builds human capacity at the statewide level as well as
at local organizations and technical assistance providers. The
resources offer communities assistance and guidance in developing their
project ideas and with understanding the requirements of applying for
awards and successfully administering them once received. A number of
our peer commissions have strong programs in this area and we continue
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
to look to their experiences and lessons to better serve our region.

Responding to emerging needs--Additionally, the
Commission evaluates what role it should play in addressing obstacles
that limit economic opportunity in rural areas. Increasingly both
housing and access to health care have emerged as significant
priorities for many rural communities. While the Commission is able to
fund projects in both of these areas, we are actively considering how
to best leverage our resources in order to complement, and not
replicate, the work of other agencies. One such strategy is
establishing a J-1 Visa Waiver program that will allow for the
recruitment of foreign-born physicians trained in the United States to
rural areas. Another has been to contributing to the creation of new
housing in the region by funding the water and wastewater
infrastructure needed for these developments to move forward.

Each of these points illustrate a way in which the Commission is
maximizing its unique structure as a regional agency to the benefit of
rural areas. Looking beyond the broad themes of our work, I am happy to
offer some specific project examples that highlight how this work plays
out in practice.
In our most recent Catalyst round, the Commission awarded $2.25
million to the Town of Killington, Vermont. While the town is well
known as a ski destination, the majority of visitors to the area, and
many neighboring residents, are less familiar with the ways in which
failing infrastructure has inhibited economic growth, impaired drinking
water, and have contributed to outmigration and a falling population in
the county. The Commission's investment in public water and road
infrastructure will help the town address a water supply contaminated
by PFAS and make critical safety upgrades to a highly traveled roadway.
The public investment of funds is the cornerstone to facilitating
development of hundreds of housing units and nearly $285 million in
private investment. These plans have been decades in the making and
will now become a reality in part because of the Commission's
investment.
Nearly every community and business the Commission engages with
raises workforce development as a challenge to economic growth. In the
summer of 2022 NBRC awarded $285,000 to the North Country Chamber of
Commerce located in Plattsburgh, New York, for an important workforce
development project. Many of our communities are seeking ways to
bolster domestic manufacturing and this project is providing trainees
with the skills required to obtain a welding job at a number of North
Country-based manufacturing employers. By aggregating the needs of
multiple local manufacturers, and providing training at no-cost, this
project offers just one example of the ways in which NBRC is helping to
address both short and long-term workforce needs of the employers in
our region.
Economic development in rural areas often looks very different than
it does in cities. One city block may be completely transformed over
the course of one year with one large project. In contrast, the
development of one building on a rural main street might take an entire
year, if not longer. Rural communities often need to stitch together
multiple sources of patient capital to undertake one project, but once
completed that successful project can have a catalyzing impact on an
entire town.
Such is the case with the redevelopment of the Parker Noyes
Building in Lancaster, New Hampshire, undertaken by the Northern Forest
Center. An award from NBRC was a small portion of the capital stack
assembled to renovate this cornerstone block in downtown Lancaster in
order to transform it into a local food hub and six market-rate
apartments. The redevelopment has sparked follow-on private investment
on Lancaster's Main Street, with multiple other properties being
purchased with the goal of renovating them into mixed-use developments.
NBRC's investment played a small but meaningful role in ensuring the
project could move forward, ultimately fostering increased economic
development in the town.
These three examples demonstrate the different ways rural
communities utilize NBRC's flexible funding to achieve their aims. As
the Commission continues its existing programs, we are also actively
planning for the future. The Commission is part way through the writing
of a new strategic plan that will help shape our work over the next
five years. This work will complement the input and direction we get
from our partners in Congress.
Earlier this year, a bi-partisan group of Representatives
introduced H.R. 4188, the Northern Border Regional Commission
Reauthorization Act of 2023. The bill has been cosponsored by nearly
every Member of Congress from districts representing counties included
in the Commission territory. We appreciate the work that has gone into
drafting this legislation and its companion bill, S.292, introduced and
cosponsored by the Senators from our region. The proposed
reauthorization contains a handful of administrative provisions with
the objective of streamlining the Commission functions, and a few
additional investment areas and provisions that mirror the statutes of
our peer commissions designed to make federal funds more accessible to
resource-limited communities.
We look forward to working with Congress and am pleased to answer
questions regarding the Commission's work to better our region. Thank
you again for the opportunity to testify and I look forward to your
questions.

Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
Dr. Reed, you are recognized for 5 minutes for your
testimony.

TESTIMONY OF HON. JENNIFER CLYBURN REED, Ed.D., FEDERAL
COCHAIR, SOUTHEAST CRESCENT REGIONAL COMMISSION

Ms. Reed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Titus,
committee members, and staff. Thank you for the opportunity to
testify on behalf of the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission
since being activated in January of 2022.
I also want to thank the Members of Congress and President
Biden for their confidence and support for this region. There
is an abundance of greatness and potential here.
Many thanks to the Members of Congress who have met with me
over the past 22 months and offered support to SCRC as we
create and formalize policies and procedures to meet the needs
of its 51 million residents and generate jobs and opportunities
within the 428 counties, spanning over 210,000 square miles.
The region consists of seven States: portions of Alabama,
Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia,
and the whole State of Florida. Currently, it is the largest of
all the active regional commissions.
I have much appreciation for State Cochair Governor Henry
McMaster and the other Governors, Governor's alternates,
program managers, and staff who have shown and continue to show
their support and commitment to SCRC.
Two years ago, I sat before the Senate Committee on
Environment and Public Works as a nominee. At that time, I
identified goals which included assessing the needs of each
community, naming regional challenges, and determining the
tools needed to transition counties from a distressed economic
designation.
Today, I will share what I have learned and how SCRC is
progressing.
Upon establishing the commission, we worked to develop an
initial set of bylaws. A seven-State survey was disseminated
with questions that centered around, ``What will make you love
where you live?'' We hosted virtual ``Coffee and
Conversations'' in each State to introduce SCRC and to glean a
better understanding of each State's needs.
SCRC also held collaboration sessions to hear how regional
stakeholders thought economic growth, development, and
sustainability should look.
Information from these efforts led to the formation of
SCRC's 5-year strategic plan. Additionally, partner States
created State economic development plans, which illuminated
each Governor's priorities.
Feedback from the information-gathering efforts revealed
six overarching goals: invest in critical infrastructure,
improve health access and outcomes, strengthen workforce
capacity, foster entrepreneurial and business development,
expand affordable housing stock and access, and promote
environmental conservation and preservation.
During that hearing 2 years ago, Senator Carper suggested
that I find what works and do more of that. SCRC commissioned a
three-part health assessment to address gaps in healthcare
needs and access. Nationally, 76 rural hospital closures have
been reported between 2011 and 2021. Nearly 20 percent occurred
within the southeast crescent region.
When preparing for the start of the flagship grant program,
SCRC formalized cooperative agreements with all participating
States and the 55 local development districts to strengthen
economic development and sustainability.
In June, SCRC launched its inaugural State Economic
Development and Infrastructure grant program. The pre-
application phase is now complete; 363 pre-applications
totaling $119 million were submitted and are now under review;
$20 million will be spent on these worthwhile projects.
The large number of projects that SCRC cannot fund this
year shows the high demand for economic development and
infrastructure investment.
I look forward to working with Congress on H.R. 5899, a
bipartisan bill to reauthorize the commission.
SCRC is committed to building sustainable communities and
fortifying economic growth in its 428 counties. We look forward
to building partnerships with local, State, and other Federal
entities to ensure a prosperous future for all who call the
southeast crescent region home.
Thank you for your time and attention.
[Ms. Reed's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Jennifer Clyburn Reed, Ed.D., Federal
Cochair, Southeast Crescent Regional Commission
Good morning.
Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, Committee Members and Staff,
thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the Southeast
Crescent Regional Commission (SCRC) and share how it has progressed
since being activated in January 2022. I also want to thank the members
of Congress and President Biden for your confidence and support for
this region of the country. There is an abundance of greatness and
potential here.
Many thanks to all the Members of Congress who have met with me
over the past 22 months and offered support to SCRC as we create and
formalize policies and procedures to meet the needs of its 51 million
residents and generate jobs and opportunities within the 428 counties
which span over 210,000 square miles. The region, or footprint,
consists of seven states--portions of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and all of Florida.
Currently, it is the largest of all active regional commissions.
I have much appreciation for my State co-chair, Governor McMaster,
and the other Governors, Governor's Alternates, program managers, and
staff who have shown and continue to show their commitment to the
region by putting forth great effort.
Two years ago, almost to the day, I sat before the Senate Committee
on Environment and Public Works as a nominee. At that time, I
identified goals to pursue--assess the needs of each community, name
regional challenges, and determine the tools needed to transition
counties out from a distressed economic designation to transitional or
attainment status. Today, I'll share what I've learned and how SCRC has
progressed.
Immediately after acquiring an Employer Identification Number
(EIN), work commenced to develop an initial set of bylaws. A seven-
state survey was disseminated with questions that centered around,
``What will make you love where you Live?'' We hosted virtual ``Coffee
and Conversations'' in each state to introduce SCRC and glean a better
understanding of each state's needs. SCRC also held Collaboration
Sessions to hear how regional stakeholders thought economic growth,
development, and sustainability should look.
Information from the seven-state survey, Coffee and Conversations,
and Collaboration Sessions was compiled to formulate SCRC's Five-Year
strategic plan. Additionally, participating partner states created
state economic development plans which illuminated each Governor's
priorities.
Feedback from the information gathering efforts revealed six
overarching goals for SCRC to reach to have a positive impact within
the footprint:
(1)  invest in critical infrastructure,
(2)  improve health and support services access and outcomes,
(3)  strengthen workforce capacity,
(4)  foster entrepreneurial and business development activities,
(5)  expand affordable housing stock and access, and
(6)  promote environmental conservation, preservation, and access.

These guiding principles are in sync with SCRC's statutory
obligations to:

develop public, transportation and telecommunications
infrastructure;

assist with job skills training, business development and
entrepreneurship;

provide access to basic health care and other public
services;

promote conservation, tourism, recreation, and the
preservation of open space; and

also encourage the use of renewable and alternative
energy sources.

During that hearing two years ago, Senator Carper suggested that I
find what works and do more of that. In response to the data gleaned
from outreach efforts, most notably, SCRC found gaps in healthcare
access. Of the 76 rural hospital closures between 2011 and 2021, nearly
20% occurred within the Southeast Crescent region. In response to that
statistic, SCRC was encouraged to use the J1 Visa Waiver Program. It
was already being offered by two other regional commissions and proved
highly successful. In conjunction with the Department of State, SCRC
processed its first application in November 2021 and, to date, has
successfully retained 65 doctors in areas of the region where health
access was lacking. SCRC also commissioned a three-part health
assessment of the region. Part I compiled data for the 166 distressed
counties and is now complete. Part II will focus on the 177
transitional counties and Part III will gather data for the 85
attainment counties.
When preparing for the start of the flagship grant program, SCRC
formalized cooperative agreements with all participating states and the
55 local development districts to fortify economic development and
sustainability in communities.
SCRC launched the inaugural State Economic Development and
Infrastructure (SEID) grant program in June 2023 and the pre-
application phase is now complete. 363 pre-applications totaling $119
million were submitted and are currently under review--an extraordinary
showing for the first grant opportunity cycle. There was a wide range
of projects with the percentage of construction projects at 56% and
non-construction projects at 44%. Fiscal Year appropriations plus
funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law totaling $20 million
will be spent on these worthwhile projects. The large number of
projects that SCRC cannot fund this year shows the high demand for
economic development and infrastructure investment in our region.
I look forward to working with Congress on H.R. 5899, the
Southeastern Crescent Economic Empowerment Act. This bipartisan bill to
reauthorize the Commission includes legislative proposals from the 2024
Budget, such as authority for the State Capacity Building Program and
identifying promoting housing accessibility as an eligible activity.
SCRC is committed to building sustainable communities and
strengthening economic growth in the 428 counties and county
equivalents that make up the Southeast Crescent footprint. We look
forward to continuing partnerships with local, state, and Federal
entities to allow SCRC to achieve its mission, ensuring a prosperous
future for the people who call the Southeast Crescent region home.
Thank you for your time and attention.

Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Dr. Reed.
Mr. Boyle, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF GARRETT C. BOYLE, FEDERAL COCHAIR, DENALI
COMMISSION

Mr. Boyle. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member
Titus, and honorable members of the committee. Thank you for
inviting me to testify and providing this opportunity to
present the Denali Commission's perspective.
We are unique among the other regional commissions, as we
operate solely in Alaska. While this may seem like a narrow
focus, I assure you, it is not.
Alaska has a population of just over 730,000 people spread
out over more than 571,000 square miles of land area, which
makes the State larger than Texas, California, and Montana
combined and leaves us with a population density of about 1.27
people per square mile.
Alaska has about 160 municipalities, ranging in size from
about 20 to around 300,000. Of these municipalities, 86 percent
are not connected to the road system, which means everything
the community needs is either barged or flown in, significantly
driving up costs and logistical problems.
About 80 percent of these municipalities are considered
rural, meaning a population of less than 1,500. Slightly more
than 50 percent have less than 500 residents; 13 percent less
than 100. Only 6 have more than 30,000 residents.
Many of those smaller communities do not have much in the
way of a cash economy. Many who live there still follow a
traditional lifestyle. The municipality often does not have tax
authority, and there is not much to tax even if it did. The
infrastructure base is frequently decades behind most of the
country.
I share this information with the committee to illustrate
the challenges of promoting economic development in the rural
parts of Alaska, which is where the Denali Commission does the
majority of its work.
We aim to address the challenges presented by Alaska's
geography and low population in a holistic way.
To begin, many villages are powered exclusively by diesel
generators. The cost of electricity averages 47 cents per
kilowatthour in rural communities, but it ranges from a high of
$1.50 to a low of about 37 cents.
As a point of comparison, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
states the average cost of power here in the DMV area is 16.2
cents per kilowatthour.
It is incredibly hard to have an economy when power costs
that much.
We fund a wide array of energy projects, from new power
houses, bulk fuel tank farms, and, increasingly, renewables in
order to bring those costs down. We engage in efforts to bring
broadband to these areas to provide more economic
opportunities.
Several years ago, the commission started working groups to
raise awareness and encourage stakeholders to consider a
statewide strategy. This outreach resulted in technical
assistance grants in eight regions supporting planning,
engineering, strategy, and applications to larger grant
opportunities.
As a specific example, the commission's grant to the Tanana
Chiefs Conference, which is a Tribal organization representing
42 Tribes in the interior, resulted in three winning grants
from different programs for over $90 million in investment.
We also have direct economic development efforts. Last
year, we partnered with the Southeast Conference, a regional
economic development organization, and pledged $1.5 million in
non-Federal match to their Build Back Better regional challenge
application, which resulted in a $49 million award to the
Alaska Mariculture Cluster.
This award will help grow the mariculture industry to a
target of $325 million per year, supporting 1,800 jobs across
the State from Ketchikan in the southeast to Unalaska far out
the Aleutian Chain in the southwest, in 20 years.
Finally, the Village Infrastructure Protection Program has
been working with Tribal, local, regional, State, and Federal
partners to support the resilience of Alaskan communities. We
have funded the planning, partnership, and construction efforts
to move communities to safer environments while also protecting
communities in place and assisting in managed retreats.
One project has used our funding to leverage additional
support and generate more opportunity for Alaskan communities.
Our partnership with the Alaska Native Tribal Health
Consortium's Center for Environmentally Threatened Communities,
which I will call CETC for short, began in 2016. Recognizing
the value in this partnership, the commission has increased the
awards over the years.
Since program inception and June 30, 2023, the CETC has
provided technical assistance to 39 communities and secured $43
million across 133 projects to benefit 44 different
communities.
The commission is proud of our work to improve the lives of
Alaskans, especially those in rural communities. We look
forward to working with your committee, and we would welcome a
discussion about potential legislative changes that can
strengthen the work of the commission.
Thank you for convening this hearing, and I welcome your
questions.
[Mr. Boyle's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Garrett C. Boyle, Federal Cochair,
Denali Commission
Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and Honorable Members of the
Subcommittee,
Thank you for inviting me to testify and providing this opportunity
to present the Denali Commission's perspective. We are unique among the
other regional commissions, as we operate solely in Alaska. While that
may seem like a narrow focus, I assure you it is not. Alaska has a

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I share this information with the Committee to illustrate the
challenges of promoting economic development in the rural parts of
Alaska, which is where the Denali Commission does the majority of its
work. To illustrate: in fiscal year 2022, of the $21 million the
Commission awarded, 97% was allocated to areas that were considered
economically distressed or disadvantaged. For fiscal year 2023, we will
be making awards that total just under $32 million, of which 97 percent
will go to disadvantaged or distressed areas. The Denali Commission
aims to address the challenges presented by Alaska's geography and low
population in a holistic way.
To begin, many villages are powered exclusively by diesel
generators. The cost of electricity averages 47 cents per kilowatt hour
in rural communities, but it ranges from a high of $1.50 to a low of
about 37 cents.\2\ As a point of comparison, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics states the average cost of power here in the DMV area is
16.2 cents per kilowatt hour. It is incredibly hard to have an economy
when power costs that much. Rural Alaskan households spend an estimated
27 percent of their annual income on energy--which includes both power
and home heating--compared to 7 percent for urban Alaskans.

Power%20Cost%20Equalization/FY22%20PCE
%20Community%20Report.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
One factor that influences the cost of all rural energy is the
availability of bulk fuel purchasing--which relies on an appropriately
sized and code compliant bulk fuel tank farm--such that heating oil and
diesel for power generation, as well as transportation fuels, can be
purchased and delivered in bulk by barge during the brief seasonal
windows of \3\ opportunity, where that's possible, rather than in
smaller, more costly quantities throughout the year delivered by
airplane. Even in communities with renewable energy integrated into the
power generation mix there's still a critical need for bulk fuel
purchase and storage. Without significant state and federal investment
in these critical bulk fuel facilities, the cost of rural energy would
be exponentially higher. A 2016 study found that public investments in
this infrastructure saved sometimes more than $2.00/gallon in the cost
of the fuels stored there.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Alaska continues advancing down the long and slow road to a
carbon-reduced energy future, our rural communities' energy systems
will have an unavoidable place for diesel. At a minimum, it will be
needed for backup power generation and for building heat, and the
futuristic possibility of someday displacing all of rural Alaska's
diesel with renewables for power and heat is at best several decades
away if for no other reason than it takes a long time to make change in
these far-flung places. In the meantime, bulk fuel tank farms will
continue playing a critical role in the rural Alaska community
landscape. One bulk fuel project costs around $9 million these days.
Since 1999, the Commission has invested more than $255 million in bulk
fuel projects; $115.7 million of those funds have come from the TAPL
transfers, $70 million from the Rural Utilities Service (RUS), and
$44.5 million from the Commission's ``base'' appropriations that come
from the Energy & Water bill to match the RUS funds. Additional base
appropriations have been used to reach more communities, and the
Commission has also received funding from the EPA to do bulk fuel work.
While we have partnered with the Rural Utilities Service to fund some
of these projects in the past, but going forward, the Commission will
likely be the only federal agency to provide funding for diesel power
generation.
While they may not fit into the idealistic picture of renewable and
sustainable energy, well maintained bulk fuel tank farms in good
condition provide a level of security that helps manage energy costs
and, by allowing confidence to members of a community that they will
make it through winter without having to make the impossibly hard
choice between feeding their families or keeping the house warm, builds
the kind of resilience that makes planning and innovation possible--the
very things we need to advance farther down our carbon-reduced energy
road.
Much of Alaska's foundational energy infrastructure--bulk fuel tank
farms, rural powerhouses, and distribution systems--are aged beyond
their expected useful life. Inadequate operations and maintenance due
to funding shortages and management capacity challenges, combined with
the harsh climates in which these facilities are located, exacerbated
by the effects of a rapidly changing climate, has created an
overwhelming backlog of deferred maintenance for energy infrastructure
throughout rural Alaska. The Alaska Energy Authority estimates more
than $300 million for powerhouses and more than $800 million for bulk
fuel tank farms is needed for critical repairs or replacements. The
cost of distribution system upgrades is not included in this estimate
but is undoubtedly a high cost as well. The more time it takes to meet
the deferred maintenance need for critical rural energy facilities will
inevitably raise the price tag, and more importantly, it increases the
risk of infrastructure failure, which results in a cascade of
additional social, environmental, and financial consequences. We fund a
wide array of energy projects--from new powerhouses, tank farms, and
increasingly, renewables--in order to bring those costs down.
We also engage in efforts to bring broadband to these rural areas.
Several years ago, the Commission started hosting working groups to
raise awareness and consider a statewide strategy, working with 12
Alaska Native Regional Corporations, 12 regional Native nonprofits, and
other statewide nonprofits. This outreach resulted in technical
assistance planning grants in eight regions supporting planning,
engineering, strategy, and applications. As a specific example, the
Commission's Grant to the Tanana Chiefs Conference, representing 42
interior tribes, resulted in Applications submitted to U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA) Community Connect, National Telecommunications
and Information Administration (NTIA) Tribal Broadband Connectivity
Program 1, USDA ReConnect 3, and USDA ReConnect 4, resulting in three
winning grants for over $90 million as of Spring 2023, with several
anticipated Awards pending as of Fall 2023. The Commission achieved
success through early awareness of the opportunity and focused
response, developed with key regional partners meshing the best
approach to building complex networks in remote communities.
The Commission's transportation program was reauthorized in the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and we are engaged in helping
build out economically impactful projects in this space as well. One
such project is the Commission's award to the village of Emmonak for
dock storage. The Denali Commission awarded the Emmonak Dock Storage
Project $200,000 to remove the scrap metal and convert the site into
the first-ever secure, fenced storage facility for port operations,
emergency response supplies and boats in Emmonak. This will advance the
City's goals toward building a full-service port that will support the
regional commercial fishing industry that employs hundreds of workers
from local communities in the region. The Dock Storage Project will not
only benefit the City of Emmonak but will support better operations for
barge services that provide many goods to communities of the Lower
Yukon Region. Another award to the Bristol Bay Native Association aims
to identify the preferred alignments for approximately 60 miles of new
roads that will connect the communities of Ekwok, New Stuyahok,
Koliganek, to Aleknagik, which has road access to the regional
community of Dillingham. The project increases access to economic
opportunities in the region by surveying more reliable and efficient
travel routes that could be utilized year-round, and will conduct
planning, engagement, and preliminary engineering activities for the
project.
We also have direct economic development efforts. Last year, we
partnered with the Southeast Conference--a regional economic
development organization--and pledged $1.5 million in non-federal match
to their Build Back Better regional challenge application, which
resulted in a $49 million award to the Alaska Mariculture Cluster. This
award will help grow the mariculture industry to a target of $325
million per year, supporting 1,800 jobs across the state from Ketchikan
in the Southeast to Unalaska, far out the Aleutian Chain, in the
Southwest in 20 years. This project also involves numerous private
sector partners, ranging from the Sealaska Corporation and numerous
seafood companies to several philanthropic partners. In fiscal year
2022, the Commission awarded $1.3 million in direct economic
development awards.
Finally, the Village Infrastructure Protection Program has been
working with Tribal, local, regional, state, and federal partners to
continue to support the resilience of Alaskan communities. We have
funded the planning, partnership, and construction efforts to move
communities to safer environments while also protecting communities in
place and assisting in managed retreats. All of these impact the well-
being of the Alaskan economy. One project has used our funding to
leverage more funding and generate more opportunity for Alaskan
communities. The Commission's partnership with the Alaska Native Tribal
Health Consortium-Grant Center for Environmentally Threatened
Communities (CETC) began in 2016. Recognizing the value in this
partnership, the Commission has increased the award over the years with
the most recent amendment providing the CETC with another $500,000.
Between program inception and June 30, 2023, CETC has provided
technical assistance to 39 communities and secured $43 million to
benefit 44 communities across 133 projects. Every three cents invested
by the Denali Commission into CETC has resulted in one dollar for
infrastructure protection in Alaska communities.
The Denali Commission is proud of our work to improve the lives of
Alaskans, especially those living in rural communities. We look forward
to working with your Committee, and we would welcome a discussion about
potential legislative changes that can strengthen the work of the
Commission. Thank you for convening this important hearing, and I
welcome your questions.

Mr. Perry [presiding]. Thank you, all. The Chair does thank
you for your testimony.
And we will now turn to questions for our witnesses. The
Chair recognizes himself for 5 minutes for questions.
I think there is a reasonable claim to be made that
regional commissions do duplicative work at multiple levels of
Government. There are State and local programs for almost
everything.
I am not going to read through all of it because that would
spend all the time. But we have the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Small
Business Administration, U.S. Department of Education,
Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services,
Department of Energy, Department of Commerce, Department of
Transportation, Department of Agriculture, and a panoply of
programs, and all of those agencies that do exactly what you
do, and yet you do it, too. It's just inefficient.
Let me ask you this, Ms. Manchin. I am close to the
Appalachian Regional Commission geographically. It is not in
the district that I represent, it is adjacent to it. I am
looking at a map here, and I am sure you are probably familiar
with the map.
So, if I look at that, all the white area is counties that
aren't included. The gray areas are attainment counties. So,
what, 58 years this has been going on? I see one, two, three,
three attainment areas. This is a map as of 2023 [indicating
map], everybody to see here. I mean, for 58 years we have got
attainment of three counties here.
What is the cost over the 58 years for the Appalachian
Regional Commission? Can you tell us that?
Ms. Manchin. Well, thank you very much. And I appreciate--
we do look at that. I have lived in the Appalachian region all
of my life, and so, I have seen the isolation and the poverty
that is there.
And so, we have been building--we have been on the mission
of building the highway system since 1965, and we are now about
91 percent complete on that. Building highways through the
mountains is not an easy task. And it also takes cooperation
with the States and funding that comes from several different
arenas.
Mr. Perry. Did you say 95 percent complete?
Ms. Manchin. Ninety-one.
Mr. Perry. Ninety-one. So, if you are 91 percent complete
since 1965, do we have to wait until we are 100 percent
complete in building the highways before we see any of these
counties go from attainment to anything better than attainment?
Ms. Manchin. Well, certainly. I mean, Corridor H that comes
from Washington across and comes into the eastern panhandle of
West Virginia is one of the latest, Corridor H----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. I am familiar with it.
Ms. Manchin [continuing]. And we are working on that. But
it takes--this is a series of years. You don't build the
highway in a year.
Mr. Perry. I get it, I mean. But we are talking about an
area that is right here [indicating map], but we have got this
whole thing right here. Some of this is dark red or black,
almost distressed, one, two, three counties, one in Virginia,
one in Georgia, one in Alabama. So, if you are 95 percent or 91
percent complete . . .
Ms. Manchin. That is through the entire, from southern New
York----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. Yes. So, why aren't we seeing
more counties meet attainment? I mean, it has been 58 years.
And with all due respect, I know you haven't been there for 58
years, but this is costly to the American people.
Ms. Manchin. Well, because there is--because you build the
highways and then you have the impact of when coal goes up and
when then coal went down and 70 percent of the jobs lost.
Mr. Perry. OK. Fair enough. But----
Ms. Manchin [interrupting]. If you notice, the highly
distressed counties are through southern West Virginia and
eastern Kentucky.
Mr. Perry. So, just to be clear here, in my opinion, the
coal industry has been destroyed by the Federal Government. It
just didn't go away on its own, it has been destroyed by the
Federal Government. And if the Federal Government was so
concerned about the Appalachian region, maybe they should have
thought about that before they destroyed the economic vitality,
maybe what little there was or is in the Appalachian region.
But they did that.
That having been said, I am looking at, this is the
Appalachian Regional Commission, the city of Toccoa, Georgia,
the Ritz Theatre Annex, $750,000, to include the expanded
lobby, concession stand, merchandising stand, bathroom,
storage, ticketing, balcony access, and more.
Now, I don't know if that county is the one county in
Georgia that has reached attainment, but it doesn't seem to me
that money went for building a highway.
And, God bless them, I am sure they love their theater. I
have got a theater that I represent in Middletown that we would
love to have kept open because it was historic, but nobody
could afford to keep it.
We spent a boatload of money on the one in New Cumberland,
Pennsylvania. We did it. We didn't ask people from California,
New York, and Florida to do it, we did it. These are State and
local issues. These are not Federal issues. And how do we
justify?
And I don't mean to pick on you, ma'am. I mean, I can go
through a list here.
We have got, in the northern border region, the fund, the
replacement of a double chair lift and to upgrade existing
snowmaking infrastructure. How about purchase of a trail
groomer and a Mogul Master drag? I live within eyesight of a
ski resort where I live, and I am sure they would love to have
the Federal Government pay for their snowmaking, their chair
lift, and their new snow machinery. I am sure they would love
it.
And then in the Denali Commission, a bike and pedestrian
path. It is wonderful, I am sure. It is not a Federal
responsibility.
Or how about the development of an art studio? Again,
building a visitor and retail center. I am sure they are all
wonderful. These aren't things that we should be paying for at
the Federal level. These are local issues, ma'am.
Let me just ask you this. Can you tell me, if you know, how
much of the commission's budget goes to pay for salaries and
other administrative costs and operating, and how much of your
budget is directed to actual programming?
Ms. Manchin. Yes. When grants are presented, that is all in
it. We have third-party evaluators that evaluate all the
programs and initiatives that we have. So that we ask for
impact, how many jobs are going to be created, what is the
impact on communities and----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. Do you have a number? Do we have
a percentage? What is the metric there?
Ms. Manchin. Well, it is different. The POWER grants, these
POWER grants are all designed a little differently to address
different needs.
But what we have found through our third-party evaluators
is that the money that has been invested in these communities
has reached or exceeded the expectations of what that grant was
to do.
Mr. Perry. And----
Ms. Manchin [interrupting]. So, we are talking about
bringing clean--in the 21st century, we are still bringing
clean drinking water into these communities.
Mr. Perry. I understand, ma'am, but I am looking for a
metric by which we can measure your success, and I don't see
any.
And even the IG, especially for the Denali Commission, Mr.
Boyle, has said that of the mass amount of money that has been
spent there, a very, very small percentage has been reviewed
under the inspector general. And so, almost literally no one is
looking at any of this.
Do any of you have a standard set of metrics by which you
measure your success? And I am not meaning to be pejorative
here. But we created you, I get it. But this is taxpayer money.
And you would think, you are all high-powered people that are
well connected, you should be able to come up--you are working
together, you are working with other agencies. Is there any
metric by which all of you measure your success? Anybody.
Ms. Manchin. Yes. Well, we do have measures and we do have
an inspector general over our commission that works every year
with reports. So, I don't--I mean, I don't have numbers----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. Well, his comments are not very
flattering.
But my time has expired. And now I would yield to the
gentlelady from Nevada.
Ms. Titus. Thank you.
I think I heard--maybe it was you, Dr. Wiggins, who said
that for every dollar you spend you get back--would you tell us
that statistic again?
Or was it you, Mr. Saunders?
I am sorry.
Mr. Saunders. That is correct.
Ms. Titus. That is a metric.
Mr. Saunders. I was citing from our grant round that for
every dollar, Federal dollar that is invested, there is a total
of $4 that goes to a project that is leveraging other sources
of funding.
Ms. Titus. Yes. So, that would be a metric of success if
you can take some Federal dollars and use it to leverage. Maybe
it is a private investment, maybe it is a State match, that
sort of thing. So, wouldn't that be a metric to show success?
Mr. Saunders. Absolutely. And we are asked to measure
indicators of distress and target our resources. Congress asks
us to award at least 50 percent of our resources at the
Northern Border Regional Commission to distressed communities,
and we routinely meet and exceed that target, as well as our
targets around infrastructure investment and other metrics that
Congress has put in place to say, this is how we believe we
should guide the dollars flowing to your communities.
Ms. Titus. And, Ms. Manchin, you were talking about how
many jobs were lost from the coal industry. Can you address how
your workforce development programs may have brought back some
of those jobs? There would be a metric of success.
Ms. Manchin. Yes. Most--all of our grants, whether they are
POWER grants, INSPIRE, or the multistate grants, all are around
economic development, economic vitality.
But then that spans a large region. Are we talking about
education that is going to strengthen and training programs for
industry that is coming in? The Appalachian region is seeing a
lot of industry reentering the region. The automotive industry.
And so, training for that.
Ms. Titus. Don't you all--don't you do reports at the end
of the year of how many new businesses you have attracted or
how many new people you have hired or how many have gone
through the workforce development program? Don't you all do
that?
Those are all metrics of success, I would say, or
measurements of what your accomplishments are. You just don't
have time to hit on every single one of them.
I am sure you do them, Dr. Reed. Don't you do them in the
Southeast?
Ms. Reed. Yes. Thank you for the question. And while we are
in our first round of grantmaking, we have developed targeted
impact measures to evaluate the efforts of the investments. And
these include jobs created and jobs retained. So, I look
forward to coming back next year and giving you an update on
where we stand with that.
Ms. Titus. And don't all the commissions leverage that
Federal money as you work closely with local governments? I am
sure that is not all you have and all you spend, that you can
use it to--you water the green spots sometimes. Is that kind of
what you do?
This isn't a question to any of you, but listening to you
and hearing some of the dates you have to get reauthorized to
exist, reauthorize the money, don't know how much money you are
going to get.
I have always heard from business that the main thing they
need is stability and predictability. And if you are subject to
political whims, that makes it very hard to do good investment,
I would think. Maybe you all could address that.
That doesn't mean you don't have to justify what money you
are getting and how you are spending it for taxpayers. But if
you kind of knew you were going to be in existence and
basically the minimum of how much you were going to have,
wouldn't that make the investment easier and better for
leverage?
Mr. Boyle.
Ms. Manchin. Well, I think, just to be very specific, we
are in partnership. We match money. So, any grant that comes
from the ARC has started at the local level, is matched by
State money, and then we come in as the third element. We don't
come in with a check to pass out to people to say: Build it,
and they will come. They create, and we are the third partner.
So, it is a bottom-up approach. So, if a grant comes to us
for funding for match, it is because the State, the Governor,
and the local communities of that State have actually
researched and worked on that.
Ms. Titus. Yes. Do you want to add to that, Mr. Boyle?
Mr. Boyle. I am sorry, could I ask you to repeat that
question?
Ms. Titus. Well, I have forgotten it myself by now.
No, I was just saying that if you had some stability and
knowing that you were going to be around next year and not
subject to political whims, wouldn't it be easier to invest and
leverage the Federal dollars that you get?
Mr. Boyle. Yes. I think it certainly would. Allowing
communities to know that we are going to be around for years as
opposed to we might be gone next year would make it a lot
easier for us to plan how to invest.
Ms. Titus. And you can go through a list and pick out a
theater there and a ski lift here and all. It makes a kind of
cute list of calling out these things, kind of like the
Proxmire award.
But in reality, if you put those in context, those may have
a big impact on a community. That may be a historic area, it
may bring back business, it may revitalize a downtown area.
You have got to put it in context. You can't just pick and
choose like the list that the chairman gave out.
Dr. Wiggins, you hadn't weighed in.
Mr. Wiggins. Well, to your point, I mean, we actively work
to make sure that our investments are in line with our
statutory purpose.
One of the unique opportunities we have because we do
partner with our States, we regularly are engaging with our
State members and having conversation and better understanding
the needs of the community.
So, to your point, making sure that our investments are
aligned to our purpose and having the type of impact around job
creation, how we improve infrastructure in the communities, and
really trying to make sure that we have workforce development
programs that are training people to be able to get into
family-sustaining jobs.
Ms. Titus. I yield back. Thank you.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady.
The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi,
Mr. Ezell.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you all for the active commissions that are here
today. I really appreciate it.
I want to note all the work that the Delta Regional
Authority and the Appalachian Regional Commission have done in
facilitating projects in my State of Mississippi.
Dr. Reed, since the SCRC covers my district in south
Mississippi, I want to ask you a question here.
The Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the SCRC, was
founded in 2008 and began receiving funds in 2010. The SCRC did
not have a Federal Cochair until you became the first one--and
congratulations--in 2021.
If a Federal Cochair is not appointed, regional commissions
cannot expect to expend the funds. However, before your
arrival, the SCRC received annual appropriations totaling $2.75
million.
Can you elaborate on how these funds were used?
Ms. Reed. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question.
The accumulated funds over that time were put into the
appropriations being used now for the grantmaking. So, it is
included in that $20 million that we will grant forward through
this first grant cycle.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
As previously stated, the DRA and the ARC have been
successful in partnering with counties to accomplish projects
in Mississippi.
Since your appointment, what has the SCRC done outreach-
wise to prepare counties for receiving Federal grant dollars?
Ms. Reed. Thank you very much.
We have garnered cooperative agreements with every local
development district in participating States, and there are 55
of them. We have also enacted cooperative agreements with the
States. So, we have a layered support system to make sure that
the entities applying for grants are ready to receive those
funds.
Mr. Ezell. Very good.
Lastly, each regional commission categorizes counties based
generally on economic indicators such as per capita income and
unemployment rates.
The counties that have the lowest per capita income and the
highest unemployment rates are labeled as distressed. Each
regional commission has declared that nearly every county in
Mississippi is distressed, including 66 percent of the counties
in my district. I understand that 40 percent of the funds under
each commission must go to distressed counties.
Can each of you just kind of elaborate a little bit on a
plan to prioritize funds to assist counties in Mississippi and
in my district? And let's start with the DRA.
Mr. Wiggins. Sure. As you mentioned, each year, we do an
analysis to determine which counties or parishes are distressed
in our communities. Once we do that, we have two primary
investment tools.
One tool is where we work with our Governors and our
designees in our local development districts in identifying
potential projects or opportunities to invest.
And then we have another fund that is our Community
Infrastructure Fund that is really focused on basic public
infrastructure.
So, we really work hand in hand with our local development
districts because they are part of our boots on the ground, in
a sense, in working, talking to local government, helping and
supporting project development in terms of projects that come
to us.
Statutorily, a certain percentage of our funding does have
to go into distressed communities. In addition, too, we focus
on areas, what we consider isolated areas of distress, because
you do have some communities or counties or parishes that may
be nondistressed, but you have isolated areas of distress and
poverty.
So, in addition to working with our local development
districts, our agency, ourselves, we do a lot of direct
outreach by being present, showing up, meeting with local mayor
associations, supervisor associations, so, all the types of
things to make sure that our programmatic options are in front
of, particularly, our distressed communities to maximize our
investment at DRA.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time is about up. I
yield back.
Thank you all again for being here today.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady, Ms. Norton.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Ms. Manchin, we must help ensure that Federal dollars for
infrastructure projects flow through the local community.
Throughout my service in Congress, I have worked to
increase workforce development opportunities for District of
Columbia residents whom I represent.
After I first secured funding for the Department of
Homeland Security headquarters consolidation in 2009, I worked
to establish the Opportunities Center at St. Elizabeths to help
DC residents and small businesses--including minority-owned and
women-owned businesses--procure jobs, apprenticeships, and
contracts for the headquarters consolidation and other Federal
projects.
The Opportunities Center also offers resume writing
workshops, job postings, 8(a) small business training, and
community outreach.
Furthermore, I was proud to stand with Secretary Buttigieg
in front of DC's own Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge to
announce the reinstatement of the Department of
Transportation's local hiring initiative pilot program now
permitted by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
Through local hire, we can revitalize local communities, of
course, and provide meaningful jobs.
Ms. Manchin, in your testimony, you describe how the new
Appalachian Regional Initiative for Stronger Economies, which
is funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,
supports large multi-use collaborative projects, such as
transitions to electric vehicles, something I have been working
hard on, and green manufacturing. Large-scale projects such as
these can generate new, good-paying jobs for local residents.
What are the workforce development efforts, Ms. Manchin,
including skills training, recruitment, and job placement, that
will help residents take advantage of jobs created by the new
initiative?
Ms. Manchin. Well, one of the things that you find
throughout the Appalachian region, as with all of our
commissions, is that we have academic institutions throughout
our regions.
And so, one of the great assets, I think, in the
Appalachian regions are our community colleges, which have
become really the engines for training for industry that is
coming in: the automotive industry that is coming back, the
energy industry, hydropower, the agriculture that is returning
to our area.
We are finding that our community colleges are becoming the
major engines for workforce training, not only for students out
of high school but workers that have been displaced by their
former work can go back and be retrained into these jobs and
stay in the area in which they live. They can commute.
So, this is one of the most effective. Education becomes
the foundation for economic development, for growth, for
vitality within a community.
And certainly then that can lead into a 4-year degree or
more. But community colleges are really the advocate and the
lead instrument for training for the industry that is in our
area and that is coming into our area.
Ms. Norton. Thank you very much, Ms. Manchin.
And I yield back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady.
The Chair now recognizes the gentleman, Mr. Edwards--oh,
correction--Mr. Carter.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And thank you all, Commissioners, for the incredible work
that you do.
Dr. Wiggins, in your testimony, you mentioned the
commission's role in the CIF. I am sure that you and your staff
have been working with Federal, State, and local officials on
the massive flood insurance issues that the gulf coast is
facing.
Can you share what steps your office has taken to combat
the risk of flood?
Mr. Wiggins. Well, one, our Community Infrastructure Fund
does support investments in flood control projects and other
basic public infrastructure. And we actually do tend to see a
lot of those requests come from Louisiana, particularly
southern Louisiana.
So, we actively work, again, with these local development
districts, our commissions, on helping identify project
support.
In addition, we have actually spent some time, spent time
in communities. I mentioned the mayors association meetings,
the municipal association meetings as an opportunity for our
local elected officials to hear from us.
And I will lift up at this time, too, partnership, because
an important part of our work is not just us as a commission
going at this work alone. We actually do work with our other
Federal partners closely in trying to figure out how we can
support our regions that we serve. We work with State
government. We work with the local development districts, as
well, in addition with local governments.
So, a lot of our work to address those issues around flood
control projects is really based on the local needs but making
sure that local government understands that we can be a
resource, a partnering resource, as they are looking to address
those issues around flood----
Mr. Carter of Louisiana [interrupting]. And we appreciate
that.
As you know, Risk Rating 2.0 is a major, major issue. It is
literally pricing people out of the market of being able to
either become a homeowner or maintain home ownership in homes
that they have paid for.
And now, God forbid, with the rising costs of insurance,
who would have ever thought that that could be a prohibitive
factor in people maintaining their homes?
What training programs does the DRA offer? Can you speak to
any job training fields that promote environmental
sustainability?
Mr. Wiggins. Sure. Just recently, as a matter of fact,
through our Delta Workforce Program, we awarded a partnership
grant to Southern University that included partnership with
other local development districts, Baton Rouge. They actually
do work around sustainable energy development.
And so, that is a prime example of, I think, some of the
types of projects we are investing in that gets towards climate
sustainability, resiliency.
But, again, our strategic goals, our regional development
plan helps put an eye towards the type of investments we do.
I will highlight that in those plans, it is not a plan that
is developed only by DRA input. We actually went out and talked
to stakeholders across our eight-State region to help develop
that plan, to help guide those investments.
And so, work around sustainable energy is one that we
continue to see and get more requests for, and we will continue
to work with our local stakeholders in making sure we are doing
good quality investments that are giving us a good return on
that investment in terms of impact, as well.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. As you know, in Louisiana District
Two, which is my congressional district, I represent the
largest compilation of petrochemical plants in the River
Parishes, plants that are nestled between communities.
So, obviously, we have to consistently find ways to make
sure that we have sustainability and environmental justice in
those areas. So, thank you for your efforts.
Dr. Reed, I would like to congratulate you once again on
your post to the SCRC. Thank you for coming today to brief our
subcommittee on your work over the past 22 months.
I have two questions. What has been your biggest win to
date? And how will the State Economic Development and
Infrastructure grant help you and your agency in carrying out
your mission?
Ms. Reed. Thank you for the question.
The biggest win to date is the establishment of a
relationship with the States. It is a Federal-State
partnership. And in order for us to do any of the work that we
have been charged to do, that relationship has to be solid.
So, I am really proud of the work that we have done and
look forward to the relationship that we will have with the
Governors and the Governor's alternates in getting everything
established there.
Second to that would be the 5-year strategic plan that sets
the tone for where we are going and a map to where we need to
be in the next 5 years. So, to that question.
Your second question was about the Economic Development and
Infrastructure grants?
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Yes.
Ms. Reed. OK. I am extremely proud of the interest and the
number of pre-applications that have come through; 363 pre-
applications are being evaluated right now, $119 million, while
we only have $20 million to grant away. But to know that that
interest is there.
And the projects are broad. They run from infrastructure to
health access to housing access. They run the gamut. So, we are
very proud of the diversity that those grants have shown.
I want to also point out we are statutorily bound, 40
percent of the funds are to be spent on infrastructure, and 50
percent of those funds are to be spent in distressed counties.
So, those are the challenges that we have when we are
awarding those grant funds.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Thank you very much. And that is
demonstrative.
My time is up. So, thank you very much for your leniency,
Mr. Chairman.
But I will say in closing, this is demonstrative of the
need that is out there. The great work that you are doing is
showing. And the plethora of people that are attempting to
apply talks about the real need.
And we talk about metrics. It was offered, a question
earlier. The metrics is people are showing up saying they have
need, and thank God we have resources now to be able to address
them.
So, congratulations and thank you all for the great work
that you do.
Ms. Reed. Thank you.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr.
Garamendi.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Witnesses, thank all of you. I appreciate the opportunity
to engage with you.
Some of my questions have been answered in the previous
discussions by the Members.
But I want to really begin to focus in on the critical
pieces of legislation that are now law, the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, and
just generally how in each of your commissions you are able--or
unable--to access that money, to bring that to bear in the
problems that you are attempting or you are responsible to
address.
So, Ms. Manchin, if you would care to start.
Ms. Manchin. Well, thank you.
Yes, the increased funding that came out of the bipartisan
infrastructure act, also the RFA, makes a big--increased
certainly the funding that came to us. And where you are given
more, one of the initiatives that we brought forth was the
ARISE, which is a multistate.
What I noticed, that in our 13 States, they were writing
and doing great projects. But we are not the 13 States of
Appalachia. We are the Appalachian Regional Commission.
And so, with being able to offer a larger grant, the
encouragement was that States need to work together, that if we
lift up our region, then all of our States will do better.
So, this increased funding in the Appalachian region I
think has started an impact of States working together, how
they can create bigger projects, which then impact and are much
more transformative.
The Hydrogen Hub, one of the placements now, will certainly
impact Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, it will impact that
region not only in jobs that will come there, training, but
subsidiary jobs that will come into the region.
And so, I think that our Governors and our program managers
are beginning to realize that by sharing ideas and growth and
certainly using our academic institutions between our States
will certainly greatly impact and increase the abilities of our
region to grow and gain parity.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you.
Mr. Wiggins.
Mr. Wiggins. Well, with our additional funding, we did a
couple things.
One, we leveraged the funding into existing programs. So,
for example, I talked earlier about our Community
Infrastructure Fund. Just this week, we were looking at the
amount of requests that we have.
So, for example, we have about $29 million to spend in that
particular fund, but we received $46 million of good quality
requests. So, not just the total number of applications, but
projects that are eligible, good-quality projects.
And so, we have been able to leverage the additional
funding to go further in those types of programs that we have.
The other thing that we did, what we have noticed, is there
has been a real, sort of, challenge--but we view it as an
opportunity--around capacity building in a region. Again, that
is part of our regional development plan that was approved by
our Governors.
So, two investments that we have leveraged with the
additional funding is, one, a capacity-building grant to our
local development districts. We hear throughout our region,
through our local governments, about the help we need.
So, we really have been focused on investments in capacity
and leveraging our existing programs.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you.
I am not sure we are going to have enough time to go all
the way down, so, briefly with the remaining three.
Mr. Saunders. I would just simply echo some of the same
improvements we have made to our programs as our peers have,
making larger award size, incentivizing partnerships, looking
at the fact that many rural communities have challenges,
assembling multiple funding sources to make these projects
possible.
So, we have increased some award thresholds to try to make
those projects happen quicker and more expediently.
Mr. Garamendi. Ms. Reed.
Ms. Reed. Thank you.
Past appropriations leading up to my appointment, added to
the $5 million for IIJA, all folded into the $20 million that
we are using for our current grant cycle.
Mr. Garamendi. Mr. Boyle.
Mr. Boyle. Thank you, Congressman Garamendi. It is good to
see you again.
Briefly, Mr. Chair, if I can. From our IIJA funds, directly
to your point on the IG, I am taking one-half of 1 percent of
that money to make sure he can do the work that he needs to do.
Your point is well-taken. I know that was an issue in the past,
and I am doing my best to address it.
What we are doing is we devised a 5-year spend plan for our
funds to make sure all of those moneys are available in the
outyears for our communities. Our funds may be used as non-
Federal match. We want that available down the road if other
communities get big grants from other programs but they don't
have the match available at the local level.
We are doing a lot of technical assistance to provide
capacity building and grant applications, and also doing
planning, engineering, and design work that other Federal
agencies can't fund in order to get projects to a fundable
stage.
Thank you.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you very much.
Mr. Chairman, my time having expired but my questions not,
I yield back.
Mr. Perry. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman does yield
back.
Are there any further questions from any of the Members who
have not been recognized?
I don't see any.
So, I would like to say I would like to continue the
hearing. However, there are other pressing needs apparently
that require my attendance and our attendance.
So, I hope the trip was worthwhile for you. It was
worthwhile for us in having your attendance. And while
sometimes these can seem stressful, none of us has any personal
animosity with any of you. We believe that you are hoping for
the best things in your communities and working towards that.
I think our collective job is to make sure that we are
doing it as effectively and as efficiently as we can within the
scope of all of the Federal Government.
And so, with that, that concludes the hearing for today,
and I would like to thank each of you for your testimony.
This subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:21 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Submissions for the Record

----------

Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen, a Representative in Congress
from the State of Washington, and Ranking Member, Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure
Thank you, Chairman Perry and Ranking Member Titus, for holding
this important hearing on the effectiveness of regional economic
development commissions.
We have held several hearings in the past few years to examine the
Economic Development Administration and the good work it is doing to
promote economic development in communities across the country.
But it has been several years since we held a hearing specifically
on the regional commissions. I have long been a champion of regional
economic development commissions--which leverage federal, state and
private sector resources to bolster regional economies.
With their singular focus on specific areas of the country and the
needs of those regions, regional commissions play an important and
complementary role to the EDA.
Regional commissions are unique in their structure and reach with
most led by a federal co-chair and the governors of the states in which
the commission operates. By integrating federal, state, regional and
local economic development priorities, the regional commissions help
state, local, and non-profit experts tailor responses to unique local
economic crises, trends and needs.
The impacts that these regional commissions have on communities
around our country is crucial. Construction of wastewater treatment
facilities, development of workforce training programs, industrial park
road improvements, commercial truck driver training, broadband
expansion--all these local initiatives are vital to regional economies.
I look forward to hearing from each of the commissions represented
today about their important work and the impact it is having on their
regions.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to note that the Southwest Border
Regional Commission (SBRC) is missing from this hearing. The SBRC is a
federal-state partnership between the states of Arizona, California,
New Mexico, and Texas and the Federal Government.
The SBRC was authorized in 2008 but did not receive funding until
FY21. In January of this year, Mr. Juan Sanchez of Texas was confirmed
by the Senate to serve as SBRC's first Federal Co-Chair. Mr. Sanchez
expects the commission to be operational in the very near future, and I
hope we will include the SBRC in our next hearing on this topic.
After visiting the southwest border multiple times, I am convinced
that innovative economic development projects are crucial to the
economic vitality of our border communities and the SBRC is poised to
help.
Regional Commissions are an important tool that can leverage
federal, state and private sector resources to help historically
distressed regions respond to economic challenges.
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and I thank the
Chairman and Ranking Member for holding this hearing.

Appendix

Questions to Hon. Jennifer Clyburn Reed, Ed.D., Federal Cochair,
Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, from Hon. Mike Ezell

Question 1. Can you further elaborate on which of the Local
Development District (LDD) and state cooperative agreements you have
signed and finalized? If all the agreements have not been finalized,
what is your plan to finalize the outstanding agreements before
distributing the funds that were appropriated in the LDD Capacity
Building Program?
Answer:
LDD Capacity Building Program
SCRC will allocate two million dollars from appropriated funds to
the LDD Capacity Building Program to support the 55 LDDs located in the
participating states of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina,
South Carolina and Virginia. Funding for this program is available
through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, PL. 117-328.
This non-competitive financial assistance program will strengthen
the operational capacity of LDDs and benefit communities within
distressed, transitional, and isolated areas of distress by enhancing
local economic development, administration and planning. As economic
development engines, LDDs provide services which often consists of
funding identification, grant writing assistance, planning and project
implementation.
The LDD Capacity Building Program will provide LDDs with resources
to help communities plan, develop, implement and evaluate projects. To
date, all 55 LDDs within the Southeast Crescent region have opted-in to
participate in the LDD Capacity Building Program. Of those
participating, 50 cooperative agreements have been signed by both the
LDD and SCRC. These fully executed agreements have been forwarded to
the LDDs along with required forms needed to establish the LDDs as
vendors, making them eligible to receive financial investments from
SCRC. Once the LDDs are vendors and all required forms and documents
are signed and returned, disbursements will be dispersed.
There are five LDD cooperative agreements that have not been signed
by the LDDs. Staff has contacted each one to acquire the required
signatures and documentation. The goal is to have all 55 cooperative
agreements fully executed by the close of the calendar year.
SCRC State Capacity Building Program
SCRC will allocate two million dollars of appropriated funds to
participating member states to assist with grant administration and
facilitating outreach efforts. The cooperative agreements with member
states will also assist with oversight of SCRC's financial investments
in roads, buildings, water systems, broadband networks and other
projects executed within their counties. Local technical assistance,
training and outreach will be a collaborative effort between SCRC
member states and LDDs.
SCRC collaborates with other active regional commissions to
formalize procedures and internal processes. In drafting the
cooperative agreement for the SCRC State Capacity Building Program,
staff worked with the State Program Managers (SPMs). Since SCRC shares
six states with the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), a sample
state cooperative agreement from ARC was used as a guide to draft the
cooperative agreements for SCRC's State Capacity Building Program.
Upon review by SCRC legal counsel, initial drafts which included a
scope of work, budget, and budget narrative, were delivered to the
member states for internal review by September 22, 2023. SCRC received
collective feedback from the members states on November 7, 2023. The
states' revisions were reviewed by SCRC legal counsel and the final
drafts are with the member states for signatures. Once member states
complete their internal review of the revised cooperative agreement and
signatures are acquired, funds will be disbursed to the six
participating member states. The goal is to have all six cooperative
agreements fully executed by mid-January 2024.

Question 2. Please provide a detailed outline of how you plan to
use the funds that were appropriated to the Southeast Crescent Regional
Commission (SCRC) before your arrival, and how you plan to use the
additional funds that were made available to SCRC by the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58).
Answer. SCRC was authorized by Congress in the 2008 Food,
Conservation, and Energy Act (``the Farm Bill'') and began receiving
annual appropriations in 2010. From FY 2010 through FY 2021, prior to
the appointment of a Federal Co-Chair, SCRC was appropriated $3.75
million (In FY 2010-FY 2020, SCRC received $250,000/FY and $1 million
in FY 2021).
Once confirmed in January 2022, I conducted a Backdated Treasury
Warrant exercise with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the
Department of Treasury to have those funds transferred to SCRC
Treasury-generated accounts.
Cumulative funds from FY 2010 through the current fiscal year are
being used for grants, programs and administrative operations. SCRC
also received $5 million from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act (P.L. 117-58) which has been invested in the 2023 State Economic
and Infrastructure Development (SEID) Grant program. Funds for the $20
million grant program are from the following sources:

Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, PL. 117-328 ($10
million);

Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, PL. 117-328 ($5
million);

Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act, 2021, PL. 117-58
($5 million).

Question 3. Please elaborate on how you plan to prioritize
distressed counties in Mississippi's Fourth Congressional District,
especially considering over half of the counties are distressed.
Answer. Of the 18 counties within the SCRC Mississippi footprint,
14 are distressed. The Fourth Congressional District is home to four
transitional counties and seven distressed ones. All investments by
SCRC in Mississippi's Fourth Congressional District will be guided by
the enabling statute, priorities identified in the SCRC's Five-Year
Strategic Plan and Mississippi's State Economic and Infrastructure
Development Plan approved by the Governor's office. SCRC investments
align with the six strategic goals listed below:
a.  Invest in Critical Infrastructure
b.  Improve Health and Support Services Access and Outcomes
c.  Strengthen Workforce Capacity
d.  Foster Entrepreneurial and Business Development Activities
e.  Expand Affordable Housing Stock and Access
f.  Promote Environmental, Conservation, Preservation, and Access

SCRC's authorizing statute, 40 U.S.C., Subtitle V, Sec. 15501
(b)(c)(d), stipulates at least 50% of grant funds be allocated to
distressed counties and isolated areas of distress in the region. The
statute also requires SCRC to allocate at least 40% of grant funds to
infrastructure projects tackling basic public infrastructure,
telecommunications, and transportation.
As stated previously, SCRC has entered into cooperative agreements
with 50 of the 55 LDDs located in the Southeast Crescent region. It is
a goal to have the remaining five signed by the end of the year. SCRC
is in the final stages of signing cooperative agreements with the six
participating states. The scope of work within each cooperative
agreement details how both outreach and technical assistance will be
delivered to entities in the region, to include Mississippi's Fourth
Congressional District. SCRC member states and LDDs will work
collectively to build the capacity of local communities while
simultaneously serving as conduits of change and development.
Methodology--Economic Designations
SCRC uses an index-based, economic classification system to
identify and monitor the economic status of its counties and county
equivalents. The system involves the creation of a national index of
county economic status through comparative averages of three economic
indicators--the three-year average unemployment rate, per capita market
income, and poverty rate--with national averages. The resulting values
are summed and averaged to create a composite index value for each
county. Each county is then ranked based on its composite index value
where high values indicate high levels of distress.
Per 40 U.S.C. Sec.  15702, SCRC annually assigns economic
designations to counties and areas within the region. The categories
are:
a.  Distressed Counties--Counties that are the most severely and
persistently economically distressed and underdeveloped with high rates
of poverty, unemployment, or outmigration.
b.  Transitional Counties--Counties that are economically
