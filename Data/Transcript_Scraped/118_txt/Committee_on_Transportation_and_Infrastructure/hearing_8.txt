SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation
FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation
RE:      LSubcommittee Hearing on ``Maritime Transportation
Supply Chain Issues''
_______________________________________________________________________

I. PURPOSE

The Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee
will meet on Tuesday, March 28, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. ET in 2253
Rayburn House Office Building to receive testimony on
``Maritime Transportation Supply Chain Issues.'' The hearing
will focus on the Federal Maritime Commission's (FMC)
implementation of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 (P.L.
117-146) and the Maritime Administration's (MARAD) management
of the Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP). Members
will receive testimony from the World Shipping Council,
National Association of Waterfront Employers, the American
Cotton Shippers Association, and the Port of Long Beach.

II. BACKGROUND

FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION (FMC)

FMC was established in 1961 as an independent agency that
regulates ocean-borne transportation in the foreign commerce of
the United States.\1\ FMC protects shippers and carriers from
restrictive or unfair practices of ocean carriers, including
foreign-flagged carrier alliances. FMC also enforces laws
related to cruise vessel financial responsibility to ensure
cruise vessel operators have sufficient resources to pay
judgments to passengers for personal injury or death or for
nonperformance of a voyage.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FMC is composed of five commissioners appointed for five-
year terms by the President, with the advice and consent of the
Senate.\3\ The Honorable Daniel B. Maffei was designated as

SUPPLY CHAIN

The Supply Chain is an intricate logistical system
consisting of several sequential steps to produce and
distribute products.\5\ The Marine Transportation System is an
integral link in a long chain of serialized processes that make
up the supply chain and facilitates the transport of goods to
our shores and around the country.\6\ During the COVID-19
pandemic, the supply chain faced unprecedented strain. With
activities and travel limited and hindered by COVID-19 spread
and government responses, consumers repurposed their cash
toward manufactured goods and merchandise instead of going to
the movies, dining out, or other activities.\7\ This increased
demand for manufactured consumer goods, a large part of which
are moved by shipping containers, strained shipping
capacity.\8\ The pandemic challenged the traditional market
scheme of ``just-in-time'' supply chains with ``little
inventory'' as consumer appetite for manufactured goods
grew.\9\ As inventory began to run low, manufacturers and
retailers pressured shipping companies to expeditiously move
cargo, as they frantically tried to keep up with the outsized
demand.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The resulting consequence was an imbalance in maritime
trade flows. Consumer demand in the Western Hemisphere for
goods like electronics, furniture, and clothes outpaced that of
the Eastern Hemisphere where goods are ordinarily
manufactured.\10\ This imbalance drove shipping companies to
ship empty containers to Eastern countries like China, Japan,
India, and South Korea, examples of top manufacturing
countries, for rapid loading of cargo to be transported to
countries like the United States, where demand for consumer
goods surged.\11\ This induced a sharp rise in ocean shipping
costs creating a seller's market for global container shipping
and allowing shipping companies to charge four to ten times the
normal price to ship cargoes.\12\ At its peak, the cost to ship
one container from China to the United States reached a record
high of over $20,000.\13\

Global Shipping Costs Surged in 2021

In\\ addition to increased container shipping rates, cargo
wait times soared as cargo volumes at major United States ports
rose precipitously. Large ports like the Port of Los Angeles
and Long Beach experienced long delays for ships waiting to
berth, at one point reaching a peak of 109 ships in January
2022.\15\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excessive demand and insufficient shipping capacity were
not the only contributors to the disruption in the supply
chain. The crisis was multi-faceted, highly complex, and
heavily nuanced created by a perfect collision of ill-timed
events--including degradation of shoreside infrastructure, the
Suez Canal week-long blockage, poor information sharing, low
cargo unloading/loading equipment, closure of major Chinese
ports, and workforce decreases.\16\ In recent months, the
crisis has stabilized with shipping rates returning to normal
as demand weakens. For instance, Asia to United States West
Coast prices have fallen about 90 percent since December 2021,
to $1,426 per forty-foot equivalent unit (forty-foot
container).\17\

III. OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM ACT OF 2022

Congress passed the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 (P.L.
117-146) in an effort to alleviate many of the challenges and
issues faced by United States exporters within the ocean
transportation system.\18\ It became law on June 16, 2022.\19\
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 strengthened FMC
authorities to promote the growth and development of United
States exports through an ocean transportation system that is
competitive, efficient, and economical.\20\ This legislation
authorizes appropriations for FMC through Fiscal Year (FY)
2025; sets standards for detention and demurrage charges, as
well as penalties for charges deemed inaccurate; allows FMC to
set minimum contract standards for ocean shipping service
contracts to protect United States shippers from actions which
leave export cargoes stranded at United States ports; and
increases protections for United States shippers from
retaliation by foreign ocean carriers.\21\

MARITIME TRANSPORTATION SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES

----------

TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 2023

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Coast Guard and
Maritime Transportation,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 2 p.m. in room
2253 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Daniel Webster
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Webster of Florida. The Subcommittee on Coast Guard and
Maritime Transportation will come to order.
I ask unanimous consent that the chair be authorized to
declare a recess at any time during the subcommittee hearing.
Without objection, so ordered. I also ask unanimous consent
that Members who are not on the subcommittee be allowed to
participate in asking questions and other items. Without
objection, so ordered.
As a reminder, well, I'm not going to remind you of that,
just, if you have an amendment, make sure it gets emailed to
the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
I recognize myself for the purpose of an opening statement
for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL WEBSTER OF FLORIDA, CHAIRMAN,
SUBCOMMITTEE ON COAST GUARD AND MARITIME TRANSPORTATION

Mr. Webster of Florida. Today, we will receive testimony
from stakeholders regarding the maritime supply chain,
including their views on the implementation of the Ocean
Shipping Reform Act and the Maritime Administration's
management of the Port Infrastructure Development Program.
I would like to welcome our witnesses: Bud Darr, executive
vice president of MSC Group; Matthew Leech, president and CEO
of Ports America; Buddy Allen, president and CEO of American
Cotton Shippers Association; and Mario Cordero, executive
director of the Port of Long Beach, California. Small port out
there, right?
These witnesses represent crucial aspects of the supply
chain, including shippers, ports, marine terminal operators,
and ocean carriers, and we look forward to having them share
their valuable insight.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, a sudden and massive increase
in consumer demand, combined with labor shortages,
manufacturing disruptions, and other factors fueled a supply
chain crisis that continues to strain the capacity of our
maritime transportation system. This led to significant
increases in ocean shipping costs, delayed shipments, and
extended cargo wait times at ports, as well as an imbalance in
maritime trade flows, leading to frequent export of empty
containers from the United States rather than moving those
containers inland to be filled with domestically produced
goods, particularly agricultural products.
Consumers were left with higher prices. American companies
seeking to export their goods faced hurdles in getting their
products to the ports. In response, Congress passed the Ocean
Shipping Reform Act of 2022.
Among its provisions, the law sets standards that detention
and demurrage charges must comply with; sets penalties for
charges deemed inaccurate; allows the Federal Maritime
Commission to set minimum contract standards for ocean shipping
service contracts to protect U.S. shippers from actions that
leave export cargo stranded at United States ports; and
increases protections for United States shippers from
retaliation by foreign ocean carriers.
Last week, the subcommittee heard from the Federal Maritime
Commission on their efforts to implement the Ocean Shipping
Reform Act. We look forward to hearing your views as well. To
provide support for our maritime supply chain, Congress
authorized significant funding for the Port Infrastructure
Development Program, known as PIDP, which is operated by the
Maritime Administration and provides grants for coastal ports,
inland river ports, and Great Lakes port infrastructure to
improve the safety, efficiency, and reliability of the movement
of goods.
Last week, we also heard from the Maritime Administration
regarding the President's budget request for this program,
which in addition to the $450 million in advanced
appropriations the program received through the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act. Though this program is intended to
help optimize and improve port operations, I am concerned that
the program's ability to fully realize this goal is limited by
language Congress has routinely included in the program's
authorization that prohibits the use of funds for automated
cargo handling equipment.
I look forward to hearing your views on how port operations
can be optimized and the role automation can play in improving
port operations in our Nation's supply chains.
[Mr. Webster of Florida's prepared statement follows:]

Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you for participating today.
I look forward to your testimony. I now recognize Ranking
Member Carbajal for an opening statement for 5 minutes.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As in the past, I
will yield the floor to Ranking Member Larsen, with your
consent?
Mr. Webster of Florida. Ranking Member Larsen, you're
recognized for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank
you, Ranking Member.
If the last 3 years has taught us anything, it is how a
robust and resilient supply chain is essential to our economic
and national security.
Last week, this subcommittee heard from the Federal
Maritime Commission and the Maritime Administration on the
fiscal year 2024 budget request and the implementation of the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Ocean Shipping Reform
Act.
Today we will hear from industry representatives on how
they think implementation of these laws is going and what more
we can do to prevent disruption to our supply chain in the
future.
There is no better demonstration of the supply chain
backlog during the COVID-19 pandemic than at the Ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach, although I think the Port of Everett
came in at a close second, where nearly 100 vessels were forced
to idle offshore. However, the problem was nationwide, and the
Puget Sound saw more vessels seeking anchorage than ever
before.
As imported goods were in high demand, carriers rushed to
return containers, often empty, to Asia, so they could be
loaded again. Meanwhile, U.S. companies struggled to obtain
cargo space at a reasonable price in a timely manner, which
meant their exports, often perishable, languished landside. The
icing on the cake was when they were given a bill for unfair
and unreasonable detention and demurrage fees as a result of a
situation over which they had no control.
Thankfully a bipartisan Congress and President Biden moved
quickly to address the supply chain crisis, passing historic
legislation like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the
Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022.
Included in the BIL was $6\1/2\ billion exclusively for
ports and $27 billion that ports would be eligible for.
The creation of the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force and
the Freight Logistics Optimization Works initiative, or the
FLOW initiative, optimized funding for ports to improve supply
chain fluidity and increase coordination among every link of
the supply chain.
Since the passage of OSRA, the FMC has moved quickly to
establish a process for accepting, investigating, and
adjudicating charge complaints, update regulations on
penalties, and issue a final rule on detention and demurrage.
The pandemic made clear the need for investments in
maritime infrastructure. Maritime commerce is a significant
contributor, as well, to global carbon emissions, and both the
BIL and the Inflation Reduction Act demonstrate that targeted
investments can improve resiliency in the maritime supply chain
and reduce emissions.
Investing in low- or no-emission technology at ports does
not mean sacrificing efficiency. Projects like the Middle
Harbor Terminal zero-emission conversion project at the Port of
Long Beach demonstrate that fact clearly. That project will
lower emissions, create a more resilient port, and make the
movement of cargo more efficient. This project funds the
replacement of aging diesel tractors with electric tractors,
construction of electric charging infrastructure, and
installation of software equipment to streamline cargo handling
operations.
Mr. Cordero, I look forward to hearing about this and other
projects underway at the port.
Despite the congestion we saw at the ports in 2021 and
2022, one thing never slowed: the hard-working and dedicated
longshore workers. They put in long hours each day to keep
containers flowing, despite the constant threat of exposure to
COVID-19 and a massive backlog of cargo waiting to be shipped.
Our human infrastructure is critical to the U.S. economy,
and I want to be clear that I think Federal dollars should not
be used to put longshore workers out of a job. The Port
Infrastructure Development Program prohibits Federal dollars
from being used to eliminate jobs, and I will work to ensure
that prohibition remains.
If we want to prevent the next supply chain crisis, we have
to invest in ports. They serve as the gateway for international
trade, and without modern infrastructure, our businesses,
consumers, and communities are at risk.
So, I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on what
they are doing and what the Federal Government can do to work
with them to prevent another supply chain crisis.
And with that, I yield back.
[Mr. Larsen of Washington's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen of Washington, Ranking Member,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
If the last three years have taught us anything, it's that a robust
and resilient supply chain is essential to our economic and national
security.
Last week, this subcommittee heard from the Federal Maritime
Commission and the Maritime Administration on the fiscal year 2024
budget request and implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
(BIL) and Ocean Shipping Reform Act (OSRA).
Today we will hear from industry representatives on how they think
implementation of these laws is going and what more we can do to
prevent disruption to our supply chain in the future.
There was no better demonstration of the supply chain backlog
during the COVID-19 pandemic than at the ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach where nearly 100 vessels were forced to idle offshore.
However, the problem was nationwide and the Puget Sound saw more
vessels seeking anchorage than ever before.
As imported goods were in high demand, carriers rushed to return
containers, often empty, to Asia so they could be loaded again.
Meanwhile, U.S. companies struggled to obtain cargo space at a
reasonable price and in a timely manner which meant their exports,
often perishable, languished landside. The icing on the cake was when
they were given a bill for unfair and unreasonable detention and
demurrage fees as a result of a situation over which they had no
control.
Thankfully, Congress and President Biden moved quickly to address
the supply chain crisis, passing historic legislation like the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of
2022.
Included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was $6.5 billion
exclusively for ports and $27 billion that ports would be eligible for.
The creation of the Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force and Freight
Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW) initiative optimized funding for
ports to improve supply chain fluidity and increased coordination among
every link of the supply chain.
Since the passage of OSRA, the FMC moved quickly to establish a
process for accepting, investigating and adjudicating charge
complaints, update regulations on penalties and issue a final rule on
detention and demurrage.
The need for investments in maritime infrastructure was also made
clear by the pandemic. Maritime commerce is a significant contributor
to global carbon emissions. Both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and
the Inflation Reduction Act demonstrate that targeted investments can
improve resiliency in the maritime supply chain and reduce emissions.
Investing in low or no emission technology at ports does not mean

Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you very much.
Mr. Carbajal, you are now recognized for your remarks.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL OF CALIFORNIA,
RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON COAST GUARD AND MARITIME
TRANSPORTATION

Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Chairman Webster, for scheduling
this important ``Maritime Transportation Supply Chain Issues''
hearing. While we touched on aspects of the supply chain and
the bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act in the previous
hearing, I look forward to a deeper discussion on this
important topic.
The maritime industry is a critical pillar of our economy.
In 2020, oceangoing trade accounted for 40 percent of U.S.
international trade value, amounting to 18 percent of our
country's GDP. In 2020, the top 25 tonnage ports alone handled
alone over 1.7 billion tons of cargo, including vital goods
like food, medical supplies, and everyday household items. It
is an understatement to say that our economy would not function
without a reliable and fair maritime industry.
In fact, the COVID pandemic highlighted the importance of
our supply chain and the devastating impacts that can occur if
we do not invest in our maritime industry and the agencies that
regulate them, like the FMC, Federal Maritime Commission, and
the United States Coast Guard.
During the height of COVID, I heard from exporters across
dozens of industries about unfair shipping practices and
exorbitant costs, which put companies out of business and
resulted in higher prices for their customers.
To be clear, the astronomical profits realized by foreign
shipping companies contributed to inflation in the United
States.
Some supply chain gridlock and unfair shipping practices
caused the value of California food exports to fall by $2.1
billion, or about 17 percent. That's just in California.
I was proud to work across the aisle to pass OSRA last
Congress. Since its passage, we have already seen a decrease in
vessel congestion at the ports and significant refunds in undue
charges by carriers.
As we heard last week, the FMC moved quickly on rulemaking
and the self-executing policies included in the law. I look
forward to hearing from our witnesses today about how our
supply chain has become more resilient, fair, and transparent
as a result of the passage of this bill.
I am also eager to hear about how the investments in our
ports and port infrastructure will continue to support robust
international trade and American jobs. As the nexus where cargo
moves in and out of our economy, ports have an important role
to play in our supply chain.
There is no doubt that our supply chain remains susceptible
to major market fluctuations and international events. With the
passage of OSRA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law though,
we have already made significant progress in building a more
resilient supply chain.
Thank you to our witnesses for being here today. I am eager
to dive into a conversation about how Congress can further
support a strong maritime industry and resilient supply chain.
Mr. Chair, I yield back.

TESTIMONY OF CHARLES ``BUD'' DARR, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT,
MSC GROUP, ON BEHALF OF THE WORLD SHIPPING COUNCIL; MATTHEW
LEECH, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PORTS AMERICA, ON
BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF WATERFRONT EMPLOYERS;
WILLIAM H. ``BUDDY'' ALLEN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AMERICAN
COTTON SHIPPERS ASSOCIATION; AND MARIO CORDERO, EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR, PORT OF LONG BEACH

TESTIMONY OF CHARLES ``BUD'' DARR, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT,
MSC GROUP, ON BEHALF OF THE WORLD SHIPPING COUNCIL

Mr. Darr. Thank you, Mr. Chairman; thank you, Ranking
Members; thank you, Members, for the opportunity to be here
today and speak with you about this important topic.
My name is Bud Darr. I'm the executive vice president for
maritime policy and government affairs at the MSC Group. MSC
stands for Mediterranean Shipping Company. We are the world's
largest liner shipping company.
I'm also here today on behalf of the World Shipping
Council, which represents 90 percent of the liner shipping
industry worldwide.
I'm not going to repeat what's in my written statement, you
have it, but I would like to just highlight a few points for
you to consider.
First of all, with regard to what we've just been through:
It has been an extraordinary excursion in supply, demand,
volumes, rates, and congestion, the likes of which we've not
seen in this industry, ever. All related to, in one way or
another, the COVID pandemic.
We made it through that, and now we've seen an environment
where, as quickly as rates went up, rates came down even
faster, volumes came down faster, and we're now at the point
where the supply chains are fluid once again, but quite
honestly, not for necessarily the best of reasons.
Supply chains opened up because demand fell way off, not
necessarily because of things collectively that we have
accomplished, although we did a lot to get through it together.
And I have to say, commerce kept moving, world trade kept
moving because the liner shipping industry and others in the
shipping industry, with the great, great assistance of our
seafarers who endured terrible hardship during the pandemic,
managed to keep it all flowing. And I do really want to
recognize that as a fact.
Three points I'd like to leave you with briefly. One is the
market has reacted as if market dynamics would suggest it
should. That we immediately saw when the pandemic began a drop-
off in demand, capacity was taken out of the networks, and then
when demand came back very, very quickly in the third quarter
of 2020, we saw an enormous rebound in volumes, which together
with congestion, overloaded supply chains around the world
resulted in a decrease in capacity to meet that demand and, as
you might expect, rates went up accordingly.
But what comes up must come down. We predicted that would
happen. It has happened. Now that volumes have dropped off, the
cliff on the way down has been very steep as well, and we're
now at the point of essentially similar market dynamics of both
volumes and rates to what we saw pre-pandemic.
I will add, as an illustration of that, that we could have
had 7,000 ships in our network instead of 700, and it still
wouldn't have made a difference. Those 7,000 ships would have
been piled up outside the ports rather than the numbers that we
did have.
So, fundamentally, what we had here, and this is my second
point, about the supply chains themselves and what it takes to
make them more resilient and more capable to meet the needs of
commerce of the United States market in the future, is let's
not persuade ourselves that it's a job done with that regard,
because it's not.
And the fundamentals about both infrastructure and the way
that we operate the supply chains on the inland side of the
supply chain needed work before the pandemic, became painfully
illustrated during the pandemic, and continue to need work
today so that we'll be better prepared for whatever the next
catalyst is for disruptions in the supply chain. And hopefully
we'll be better prepared at that point to deal with it, but we
need to do those things and do them in a serious way up and
down the supply chain.
You didn't see a meltdown of ocean shipping. We didn't
suddenly forget how to operate ships. We did that very, very
well. What you saw was a meltdown of the shoreside elements
causing congestion in the terminals, congestions in the ports,
and the symptoms of seeing ships anchored, numbers larger than
100, for example, in San Pedro Bay, which I hope in my lifetime
we never see again.
The last point that I'll leave you with for your
consideration is about caution in Government intervention in
the market at this moment. OSRA 2022 was just enacted not too
many months ago. The FMC, I don't believe, has actually
completed yet the first of numerous rulemakings they have to
do, and I think that we would all benefit from seeing where
that lands and how it goes. But this was a market system that
functioned quite well and delivered extraordinarily low-cost
shipping services worldwide pre-pandemic, and I think it can do
so again, but we do need to be somewhat cautious to make sure
that well-intentioned efforts do not have the opposite effect
of perhaps what's intended.
Thank you very much, and I look forward to your questions.
[Mr. Darr's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Charles ``Bud'' Darr, Executive Vice President,
MSC Group, on behalf of the World Shipping Council
1. Introduction: Mediterranean Shipping Company, the World Shipping
Council, and the Liner Shipping Industry.
Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and Members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to testify today. My name is
Bud Darr. I am Executive Vice President for Maritime Policy &
Government Affairs of MSC Group. MSC stands for Mediterranean Shipping
Company.
MSC is a global leader in transportation and logistics. As one of
the world's leading container shipping lines, MSC's fleet sails on more
than 260 trade routes, calling at 520 ports, and is targeting net-zero
decarbonization by 2050. The global footprint of our cargo businesses
also includes container terminal investments, as well as inland
transportation and logistics networks around the world. To support our
customers, MSC has 675 offices across 155 countries worldwide,
including here in the U.S. where we employ more than 1,300 staff in 10
office locations. Together with the cruise and other passenger
transportation businesses in the MSC Group, we employ more than 150,000
people onboard and ashore.
MSC is also a member of the World Shipping Council (WSC). The World
Shipping Council (WSC) is a non-profit trade association that
represents the liner shipping industry, which is comprised of operators
of containerships and roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) vessels (including
vehicle carriers). Together, WSC's members operate approximately 90
percent of the world's liner vessel services including more than 5,000
ocean-going vessels of which approximately 1,500 vessels make more than
27,000 calls at ports in the United States each year.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ A full description of the Council and a list of its members are
available at www.worldshipping.org.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The liner shipping industry provides American importers and
exporters with door-to-door delivery service for almost any commodity
to and from roughly 190 countries. Approximately 35 million TEU2 of
containerized cargo are currently imported into or exported from the
United States each year. The container shipping industry is one of the
most important facilitators of the nation's growth and ongoing economic
activity. Ocean shipping is also--by far--the most fuel-efficient form
of mass cargo transportation on the planet.
2. The U.S. Supply Chain is Back to Normal after 3 Years of COVID-
driven Congestion.
The U.S. international ocean supply chain has returned to normal.
The return to pre-pandemic trade volumes has alleviated the severe
congestion caused by the COVID-driven consumer demand for imported
goods. U.S. consumers have resumed more normal spending patterns and
are once again spending their disposable income on travel,
entertainment and services. Unfortunately, inflationary pressures have
also reduced U.S. consumer spending, resulting in retail importers
holding large volumes of inventory, which has further reduced import
orders. While the emergence from COVID-driven supply chain congestion
is welcomed, the drop in import demand has caused cargo volumes to
plummet. U.S. imports from Asia plunged 31 percent year over year in
February 2023, which is the lowest level since March 2020, extending
the sixth consecutive month of year-over-year declines in Asian imports
that began in September.

The plummet in import demand has resulted in a corresponding drop
in freight rates, which are now generally at or below pre-pandemic
levels.

3. U.S. Agricultural Exports Smashed Records in 2021 and 2022.
Ocean carriers continue to work closely with U.S. agricultural
exporters to provide innovative solutions to carry their goods to
foreign markets. While all shippers, both importers and exporters, were
affected by the COVID-driven bottlenecks resulting from import demand,
allegations that agriculture exporters were disproportionately affected
are not supported by U.S. government data. Rather, according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. agriculture sector exports
in FY 2022 reached a new record, up $24.7 billion from the previous FY
2021 record of $172.2 billion (which was a 23% increase from FY 2020).
Moreover, the value of sales increased in all of the United States' top
10 agriculture markets--China, Mexico, Canada, Japan, the European
Union, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Colombia and Vietnam, with
sales in seven of the 10 markets (China, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan,
the Philippines and Colombia) setting new records. The increase in U.S.
Agriculture exports in FY 2022 was principally due to record sales of
these top commodities:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soybeans......................................  $33.3 billion
Corn..........................................  $19.5 billion
Beef & Veal...................................  $10.8 billion
Feeds & Fodders...............................  $10.6 billion
Tree Nuts.....................................  $ 9.8 billion
Dairy Products................................  $ 9.1 billion

4. The Latest Developments and Trends Reflect a Competitive Ocean
Shipping Market.
Increased freight rates and reduced reliability during the pandemic
were not attributable to carriers or alliances. Instead, both the
Federal Maritime Commission \2\ and the European Commission \3\
concluded that these developments were caused by several other factors
wholly outside ocean carriers' control, including exceptional supply
and demand imbalances, a surge in U.S. import demand, labor shortages,
and port and inland congestion that removed effective capacity from the
market. Over the past 24 years, as carriers have worked hard to
increase operational efficiency and reduce costs, freight rates have
fallen considerably compared to the consumer price index. While
consumer prices globally more than doubled from 1998 to 2019 due to
inflation, freight rates have actually decreased, acting as a
deflationary factor to push consumer prices down. Reliability impacts
during this crisis were generally due to supply chain disruption
ashore, which led to congestions in ports and terminals, whereas the
operation of our ships at sea remained highly efficient and essentially
unchanged.

5. Ocean Carriers are Highly Concerned that the FMC has Abandoned their
``Incentive Principle'' in their OSRA 22 Detention and Demurrage
Rulemaking.
For the better part of the last five years, the Commission has
consistently worked through its Fact Findings, policy guidance, and
case law to make clear to the regulated industry that the ``Incentive
Principle,'' as set forth in its final Interpretive Rule on Demurrage
and Detention,\4\ is the touchstone of its detention and demurrage
policy. The Incentive Principle states that in assessing the
reasonableness of detention and demurrage practices, the Commission
will first consider the extent to which those practices are serving
their primary purpose of financially incentivizing cargo interests to
remove their cargo from the terminal promptly and to return equipment
in a timely manner. The Interpretive Rule also states that the concept
of reasonableness is fact-specific, and therefore the application of
the Incentive Principle will ``vary depending on the facts of a given
case.'' \5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ See Interpretive Rule on Demurrage and Detention Under the
Shipping Act, 85 Fed. Reg. 29665 (May 18, 2020), 46 CFR Sec.  545.5
(Interpretation of Shipping Act of 1984--Unjust and unreasonable
practices with respect to demurrage and detention) (2020).
\5\ See Interpretive Rule on Demurrage and Detention Under the
Shipping Act, 85 Fed. Reg. 29665, 29641 (May 18, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congress in the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 (OSRA 22)
directed the FMC to initiate a rulemaking that, ``shall only seek to
further clarify reasonable rules and practices related to . . . the
final rule published on May 18, 2020, entitled `Interpretive Rule on
Demurrage and Detention Under the Shipping Act' '' \6\. The
Interpretive Rule that Congress told the FMC to make the basis of its
detention and demurrage rulemaking is built around the Incentive
Principle, but the Commission's proposed rule never once even mentions
the Incentive Principle. Instead, the Commission's proposed rule
abandons the Interpretive Rule's fact-specific analysis and focus on
the Incentive Principle and replaces those concepts with absolute
prohibitions on charging detention or demurrage to broad classes of
entities. Because the proposed detention and demurrage rule does not
consider how billing certain parties other than shippers incentivizes
freight fluidity through the supply chain, it runs a real risk of
increasing supply chain congestion, which is the opposite of what
properly structured detention and demurrage charges are supposed to do.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ See Public Law No: 117-146 (June 16, 2022), Section 7,
paragraph (b)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ocean carriers, ports, marine terminal operators and shippers are
concerned that the Commission's rule, if adopted as proposed, will
disincentivize many players in the supply chain from timely collecting
goods from marine terminals and returning empty equipment for use by
other customers. That in turn will only increase congestion in our
nation's ports--threatening to worsen the very problem that properly
applied detention and demurrage charges are designed to minimize.
Congress was clear in instructing the Commission to use this rulemaking
to provide further clarification on how to reasonably use the tools of
detention and demurrage to incentivize cargo velocity. Given that we
are only now clearing the congestion that snarled our ports and inland
supply chains during the pandemic, it is hard to imagine a Commission
initiative that is worse aligned with Congress' objectives in passing
OSRA 22. The shipping industry welcomes clear regulations that ensure
that everyone is treated fairly. But what the Commission has proposed
will make some people pay when they have no ability or incentive to
keep cargo moving, and it will prohibit some people from paying even
when they are precisely the people that decide whether and when the
cargo moves. This is exactly backwards, and it needs to be fixed before
the FMC issues a final rule.
WSC looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress, and to
encourage the Commission towards a rule that implements OSRA consistent
with Congressional intent and sound policy, to ensure a workable and
fluid international ocean transportation system for U.S. businesses and
consumers.
6. Conclusion.
The work of thousands of supply chain stakeholders enabled the U.S.
international ocean supply chain to move record amounts of import and
export cargo throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The return to normal
volumes and balance of import and export cargo has resulted in
relieving congestion throughout the supply chain. We must continue to
collectively address the operational and commercial challenges we
faced, to ensure our supply chain has the capacity and resiliency to
meet the next challenge. We also need the support of reasonable
regulations, consistent with Congressional direction in OSRA 22, to
incentivize cargo velocity and fluidity. The ocean common carrier
community is committed to serving the international trade of the United
States, and the historical volume of cargo that we moved throughout the
pandemic, and continue to move, is the evidence of that commitment.

Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you so much.
Mr. Leech, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF MATTHEW LEECH, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, PORTS AMERICA, ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
OF WATERFRONT EMPLOYERS

Mr. Leech. Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and
members of the subcommittee, my name is Matthew Leech, and I
serve as president and CEO of Ports America.
I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you this
afternoon. Ports America is the largest marine terminal
operator, or commonly known as MTO, and stevedore in the United
States.
As an American company, we've been operating for over 100
years, and we are one of the largest U.S. maritime employers.
Currently, Ports America manages operations in 33 ports in 70
locations throughout the country.
The highest priority in our operations is the health and
safety of our indispensable workers. I'm also here today on
behalf of the National Association of Waterfront Employers,
NAWE, of which Ports America is a proud member.
NAWE is a nonprofit trade association who ensures that
there are open lines of communication between Congress,
regulatory agencies, and the gateways to our Nation's
international commerce through proactive advocacy.
MTOs are the linchpin of our maritime transportation
industry, employing thousands of American waterfront workers,
investing in U.S. port infrastructure, and serving as the
critical link moving cargo between sea and land.
We all understand and witnessed the significant supply
chain disruptions experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, the current maritime supply chain is vastly different.
Maritime cargo volumes and freight rates have normalized to
pre-COVID-19 levels, and in many cases, they are lower. In
2022, Congress responded to this crisis, including leaders
within this subcommittee, and enacted the Ocean Shipping Reform
Act, commonly referred to as OSRA.
OSRA directed the Federal Maritime Commission to undertake
several administrative and regulatory actions to implement the
Commission's new authorities. I applaud the efforts of the
Commissioners and their staff in taking rapid action through
repeated public engagement.
In some cases, the Commission has gotten it right, such as
increasing investigation of improper charges and practices, and
diligently implementing the new charge complaint process.
In other cases, however, the Commission doesn't appear to
be getting it right. Notably, in the issuance of its October
2022 notice of proposed rulemaking regarding demurrage and
detention billing requirements, I offer two specific examples.
First, the proposed rule as drafted would penalize MTOs and
threaten an MTO's ability to charge terminal demurrage, which
we consider a storage fee.
Second, in a recent informal adjudication decision taken up
by the FMC, a majority of the Commissioners determined that the
imposition of equipment detention--essentially a fee charged by
ocean carriers for the use of their equipment beyond free
time--on a holiday weekend when the equipment return location
was normally closed, was at odds with the incentive principle
and therefore unreasonable under the Shipping Act.
The application of the interpretation of this recent
decision falls short of the Commission's own incentive
principle as noted in Commissioner Bentzel's sole dissenting
opinion.
Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to submit for the
hearing record Commissioner Bentzel's dissenting order, TCW,
Inc. v. Evergreen Shipping Agency America Corp. and Evergreen
Line.
Mr. Webster of Florida. So ordered.

Mr. Leech. Thank you.
Despite this clear notice and the fact that the shipper's
agent had every opportunity to return the equipment before the
holiday weekend, the Commission deemed the detention charges
unreasonable.
Some in the industry believe that this logic could be
extended to terminal demurrage or storage, even though the
terminal demurrage or storage is qualitatively different from
equipment detention.
The analysis under the incentive rule should consider both
the actual differences in the charges, as well as the costs
associated for the services that the fees are compensating.
In this industry, fees for storage of goods are and always
have been a time-based service, irrespective of the day of the
week.
In the interest of time, my written testimony includes
relevant information regarding investments MTOs have made on
operations and cargo handling equipment. Our industry
appreciates congressional support to modernize port
infrastructure and achieve decarbonization of the entire
maritime sector, including our local communities.
I want to thank you all for inviting me to share these
updates and these concerns on critical issues which impact our
industry.

Prepared Statement of Matthew Leech, President and Chief Executive
Officer, Ports America, on behalf of the National Association of
Waterfront Employers
Good morning, Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and
members of the Subcommittee. My name is Matt Leech, and I serve as
President and Chief Executive Officer of Ports America. Thank you for
the invitation to be here today. I appreciate the opportunity to
discuss the status of the maritime supply chain and the implementation
of S.3580, Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 (``OSRA''), enacted into
law last year.
Ports America is the largest marine terminal operator and stevedore
in the United States. The company has been operating for over 100
years, is one of the largest U.S. maritime employers with approximately
945 full-time employees and hires more than 12,000 union workers on a
daily basis to operate our terminals. Currently, Ports America manages
operations in thirty-three ports and seventy locations. In 2022, Ports
America handled over 19.25 million twenty-foot equivalent units, 1.6
million vehicles, 8.27 million tons of general cargo, and 4.4 million
cruise passengers. In the industry, our marine terminals and cargo
handling operations are commonly known by the acronym ``MTOs.'' At the
corporate level, Ports America maintains its focus on key areas,
including terminal concessions, joint venture partnerships,
infrastructure funding, public-private partnerships, labor management,
and relationships with the world's leading shipping lines. Above all is
Ports America's commitment to a culture of safety. The health and
safety of our dedicated workforce is our single highest priority.
I am also here today on behalf of the National Association of
Waterfront Employers (``NAWE''), of which Ports America is a proud
member. NAWE is a non-profit trade association whose member companies
are privately-owned stevedores, MTOs, and other U.S. waterfront
employers. NAWE's member companies engage in business at all major U.S.
ports on the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, the Gulf of Mexico, the Great
Lakes, and Puerto Rico. In that manner, NAWE, as the voice of MTOs in
Washington, DC, ensures that there are open lines of communication
between Congress, regulatory agencies, and the gateways to our Nation's
international commerce.
Importance of Marine Terminal Operators
As the American public has come to understand more acutely in
recent years, MTOs are the critical lynchpin of our maritime
transportation industry. MTOs employ hundreds of thousands of American
waterfront workers, privately fund the purchase of cargo handling
equipment at U.S. ports, and most importantly, serve as the critical
link moving cargo between the sea and the land.
MTOs are the bridge between ocean transportation and inland land
transportation. All U.S. imports and export cargo using international
ocean transportation--which is [the vast majority] of all commercial
cargo--rely on MTOs to perform a combination of essential and critical
links in the supply chain. MTOs transition cargo from very different
modes of transportation (ships, trucks, and rail cars), and MTOs manage
the orderly, safe, and secure collection and distribution of cargo from
a vast array of different parties. It is the work of MTOs that connects
the products of American workers to the global economy and, in turn,
ensures that global commerce constantly flows in support of our
Nation's economy.
The national economy increasingly demands just-in-time delivery and
associated reductions in container turn time throughout the maritime
supply chain. Accordingly, MTOs must be adaptive and forward-thinking,
looking to leverage new technologies and advanced infrastructure to
ensure that the operators' skilled workforce can meet stakeholder needs
in a safe operating environment that seeks to mitigate the risk of
injury. However, while MTOs can create efficiencies through
infrastructure and equipment investment, the waterfront land upon which
MTOs operate (some of the most expensive real estate in the country)
remains finite.
Supply chain challenges from 2020 through late 2022 demonstrate
this basic supply and demand problem. Unprecedented consumer demand
following the COVID-19 pandemic and limited capacity in other parts of
the supply chain led directly to a scarcity of capacity at marine
terminal property. Two main factors drove MTO congestion: (1) an
extraordinary increase in container volumes and (2) an unprecedented
decrease in container throughput--the period of time a container stays
on a terminal. Marine terminals are a zero-sum game--each container
sitting on a terminal is occupying space that is needed for another
container coming off of (or going on to) the next ship. The analogy of
an MTO as a bridge between transposition modes is very apt. The
capacity of a bridge is a function both of how many cars it can hold at
any one time, i.e., how many lanes and the speed that those cars can
safely and efficiently move over the bridge from one side to the other.
Marine terminal throughput works just the same. Increased demand (for a
bridge, traffic on labor day weekend, for a terminal, a peak season
before Christmas) is enough to stress capacity. Still, anything that
slows down throughput can have catastrophic effects (for a bridge,
think of how road construction on one lane at the other side can back
up traffic for miles on a busy day, and for a terminal, any number of
backups outside of a terminal and beyond an MTO's control can do the
same--shortage of truckers, availability of chassis, rail congestion,
not enough warehouses to unload containers, and, sometimes, even bridge
traffic.). Terminals, like bridges, are also very expensive, have
finite capacity, and are difficult to expand without major
infrastructure development.
But there is a big difference between bridges and marine terminals
that is part of the reason for my testimony today. No one would think
it is okay use a bridge for long term parking. Indeed, if cars parked
on a bridge in rush hour, everyone would expect--demand even--that the
bridge operator has the ability and the tools to get parked cars
moving. Yet, containers are often improperly ``parked'' at marine
terminals for excessive periods of time, which was a particularly acute
problem during the pandemic, but ``warehousing'' containers at marine
terminals is an ongoing problem. Worse, the critical tools that MTOs
have available to move containers off terminals are at risk. Well-
meaning efforts to regulate excessive and unreasonable charging
practices in certain areas of the supply chain, perhaps inadvertently
or as an unintended consequence, are threatening essential tools used
by MTOs to charge for use of services and to promote movement of
cargo--namely assessment and collection of ``terminal demurrage.''
Accordingly, it is imperative that MTOs have the flexibility to use
all available tools--including the assessment of terminal demurrage--to
ensure the expedient retrieval of containers from a terminal property
and to avoid a repeat of the congestion issues of recent years.
Status of the Maritime Transportation Supply Chain
It is well known that the exceptional levels of consumer demand
that began in 2020 have receded, and the overall flow of cargo has
returned to relatively normal levels, with accordant reductions in
ocean transportation freight rates. For example, Freight Waves reported
that unlike in January 2022, when over 100 container ships were stuck
waiting off the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, in January 2023,
no ships were waiting offshore to enter San Pedro Bay. Moreover, this
turnaround is not unique to the Pacific Coast. Major Atlantic and Gulf
Coast ports have experienced similar reductions in vessel queues
despite increased port calls. Overall, marine exchange data indicates
that vessel queues and container dwell times at North American ports
and marine terminals have essentially returned to pre-COVID norms.
The current status of the maritime supply chain now must be one of
reflection, focused on the implementation of important lessons of
recent years to mitigate the risk of future congestion issues. When
examining how MTOs were able to address these historic cargo volumes
and throughput pressures, it becomes clear that the availability of two
tools was critical.
First, the assessment and collection of terminal demurrage and long
dwell fees was decisive in ensuring that containers were removed from a
terminal yard in a timely manner. While marine terminals are not
warehouses, part of moving containers through a marine terminal
requires short-term storage between the time a container is discharged
from a ship until it is loaded on a truck or rail car (and the
reverse). That period of time, which is referred to as ``free time,''
is the intended period of time to move cargo off the terminal without
additional changes. But when containers remain on the terminal after
free time, terminal demurrage is charged.
Simply put, terminal demurrage is part ``rent'' or a ``storage
fee'' for the use of the space and extended care and custody of the
container and cargo on a terminal after free time. It is also an
incentive for cargo interests to remove cargo in a timely fashion to
avoid using the terminal as a warehouse. In many situations, even with
demurrage and dwell fees, MTOs are not compensated for the negative
impact of overstaying containers, and some cargo interests persist in
abusing marine terminals as de facto warehouse storage because other
options are less convenient or more expensive.
As noted above, terminal space is finite; therefore, it is critical
both to the health of the American supply chain and the basic business
principles of MTOs that containers be retrieved as quickly as possible.
Managing the time a container is on terminal--``dwell time'' as it is
known--is critical to managing throughput and ultimately maintaining
capacity. Think of cars at an airport. Cars at arrivals and departures
are not charged for quick and usually well-monitored periods, and some
airports have short-term pickup lots that may offer a first hour free.
But virtually all major airports manage the efficiency and availability
of short- and long-term parking through the application of rates and
charges. As with marine terminals, there are both cost differences and
incentive differences at play in service charges. Close-in parking
buildings tend to cost more than more distant open lots, and close-in,
short-term parking tends to have higher charges than more distant open
lots to incentivize efficient use of time and space.
MTOs similarly use terminal demurrage to manage the on terminal
dwell time of containers. After free time there is a cost recovery
element to terminal demurrage and an incentive element (often reflected
in the use of tiers or rate increases over time) to incentivize shorter
stays and more prompt removal.
Terminal demurrage, therefore, ensures that marine terminals are
the bridge that is needed for the supply chain to function properly,
not a very expensive and under-compensated warehouse that risks supply
chain congestion. If additional warehouse space is needed, the industry
should invest in warehouse capacity, not unduly burden MTOs and risk
untenable supply chain congestion.
Second, MTOs were able to work together to create operational
efficiencies and--as necessary and when appropriate and feasible--
extend gate hours to expedite the flow of cargo through U.S. ports.
This coordination was only possible through the ability to coordinate
facilitated by the limited antitrust immunity afforded to MTO
agreements filed with the Federal Maritime Commission (``FMC'') under
the Shipping Act. Without this immunity, competitor MTOs operating on
the same public port property would be unable to coordinate efforts and
share data, which would have made it virtually impossible to address
the supply chain capacity issues of recent years.
OSRA Implementation
OSRA directed the FMC to undertake a number of administrative and
regulatory actions to implement the Commission's new authorities. I
applaud the efforts of the Commissioners and their staff in taking
rapid action through repeated public engagement. In some cases, the FMC
has gotten it right, such as increasing investigation of improper
charges and practices, following Congress' directive to implement
OSRA's requirements for ocean carrier demurrage and detention invoices,
and diligently implementing the new charge complaint process. In other
cases, however, the FMC appears to be getting it wrong, notably in the
issuance of its October 2022 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPRM'')
regarding demurrage and detention requirements mandated by Section 7(b)
of OSRA. We offer two examples.
(1) Proposed Rules Would Penalize MTOs, threaten MTO Ability to Charge
Their Own Terminal Demurrage, and are Inconsistent with how the
Supply Chain Really Works
First, the FMC's October 2022 NPRM, unfortunately, chose to ignore
the express directive from Congress in Section 7(b) of OSRA to initiate
a very specific rulemaking: clarifying reasonable rules and practices
identified in the FMC's May 18, 2020, ``incentive rule,'' but it was
not an invitation to re-write the common carrier provisions enacted by
Section 7(a) of OSRA to apply wholesale to MTOs. Aside from not
following the express directive, the FMC should not be engaging in
proposed regulation that would do by regulation what Congress chose not
to do by legislation. Indeed, instead of further clarifying issues not
resolved in the inventive principle rulemaking, the NPRM broadly and
inexplicably sweeps MTOs into such requirements, notwithstanding the
impossibility of complying with the proposed regulations. Specifically,
the NPRM proposed rules would require MTOs to have a ``direct
contractual relationship'' with cargo owners in order to bill them for
terminal demurrage. This is not only inconsistent with longstanding
relationships in the supply chain but quite frankly astonishing that
the FMC would suggest a rule that a terminal not be able to charge for
services it actually performs and which are the essential tool that
MTOs have to facilitate cargo movement. MTOs are also in the best
position to efficiently assess and collect demurrage-type charges
because the amount due is generally only known at the time a container
is removed from a terminal, which MTOs directly facilitate and manage.
If anything, MTOs should be the only party to charge terminal
demurrage, not the other way around.
The FMC's proposed rules on MTOs are inconsistent with OSRA 2022,
target the wrong part of the supply chain, and would almost certainly
not only do more harm than good but would very likely have the direct
opposite effect than Congress intended. Accordingly, not only would the
Commission's proposed changes be impossible without senselessly
prohibiting MTOs from charging for their owner services, but they would
also slow the flow of cargo, undermining the recent successful efforts
to mitigate supply chain congestion.
We hope the FMC takes this issue into consideration.
(2) Demurrage and the Incentive Principle
In addition to the FMC's rulemaking efforts, I am concerned about
some of the related policy directions of the Commission. For example,
in a recent informal adjudication decision taken up by the FMC, a
majority of the Commissioners determined that the imposition of
equipment detention (essentially a fee charged by ocean carriers for
the use of their equipment beyond ``free time'') on a holiday weekend
when the equipment return location was normally closed was at odds with
the ``incentive principle'' and therefore unreasonable under the
Shipping Act. The ``incentive principle''--a creation of the FMC's own
regulatory efforts--considers as a factor in the reasonableness
analysis the degree to which detention and demurrage charges act as
``financial incentives to promote freight fluidity.'' As noted in
Commissioner Bentzel's dissent, the ``incentive principle'' does not
replace the statutory test under Shipping Act, i.e., whether or not the
charge is ``reasonable.''
I am extremely concerned about what this recent decision could mean
for the imposition of terminal demurrage. Not because the decision
applies to marine terminal demurrage, as it does not. And not that it
should be applied to marine terminal demurrage, as it should not. But
my concern is that in the absence of clear legislation or a normal
rulemaking process--like the process Section 7(b) of OSRA mandated that
FMC undertake, the decision has created a significant amount of
uncertainty among various industry segments, and thus the potential for
rash operational changes that are both unnecessary as a matter of law
and regulation and detrimental to the interests of MTOs.
Notably, in this recent case, the shippers had advanced notice that
the marine terminal (the designated return location) would be closed on
the holiday weekend. Nonetheless, they chose to continue to hold the
ocean carrier's equipment.
Despite this clear notice and the fact that the shipper's agent had
every opportunity to return the equipment before the holiday weekend,
the Commission deemed the detention charges unreasonable. Some in the
industry believe that this logic could be extended to terminal
demurrage, even though terminal demurrage is qualitatively different
from equipment detention (e.g., the charge for the use of space), and
the analysis under the incentive rule should consider both the actual
differences in the charges as well as the different incentivizing facts
at issue. Despite this, the uncertainty is already affecting
stakeholders, and the results, if continued to their (il)logical
conclusion, would be illogical and potentially devastating.
The costs borne by the MTO in storing a container at the terminal
that has improperly exceeded its free time remain constant, whether or
not the terminal is open. To repeat, a marine terminal is not intended
to be used as a warehouse. The business model of a marine terminal
depends on a constant flow of cargo through the terminal. Accordingly,
the MTO must be compensated for a party failing to remove a container.
This is quite different from the ``lost opportunity'' costs of already
unused equipment at issue in equipment detention.
Moreover, it is clear that the imposition of weekend and holiday
terminal demurrage promotes freight fluidity, consistent with the
incentive principle. If free time has expired, cargo is incentivized to
remove a container before the weekend or holiday to avoid paying for
such additional storage costs. In addition, the availability of free
storage on the weekend is likely to disincentivize the flow of cargo,
when the alternative is relocating cargo to an offsite facility where
fees would be incurred. The aggregate result, therefore, would be an
increase in supply chain congestion at U.S. ports. Because the
potential implications of the FMC's recent decision fly in the face of
the incentive principle, we urge this Subcommittee to encourage the FMC
to avoid extending its scope to terminal demurrage.
MTO Investments in Cargo Handling Equipment
Notwithstanding the success of reducing supply chain congestion
through the use of terminal demurrage and filed MTO agreements, new
challenges are emerging. For example, Congress passed the Inflation
Reduction Act (``IRA'') last August, which appropriates $3 billion for
maritime decarbonization. The government's investment is intended to
help MTOs switch to zero- or near-zero emissions equipment to
decarbonize port operations and improve air quality in port
communities. NAWE and its members are extremely grateful to Congress
for its leadership in passing the IRA and supporting MTO investment in
next-generation cargo handling equipment. However, although MTOs and
other stakeholders want cleaner, safer, and healthier ports, the IRA's
timelines for getting new equipment are challenging for several
reasons, including:
1.  The much higher cost of electric equipment;
2.  Lost value in replacing existing equipment before the end of
its useful life;
3.  The need for expensive electric infrastructure; and
4.  The lack of U.S.-manufactured zero- or near-zero emissions
cargo handling equipment.

NAWE and its members continue to investigate the anticipated costs
and timelines of switching from existing cargo handling equipment to
zero- or near-zero emissions equipment. However, given the above-listed
challenges, we anticipate that the aggregate costs to bring U.S. ports
into compliance with the IRA's decarbonization goals will be in the
tens (and possibly hundreds) of billions of dollars and will far exceed
the IRA's timelines, even if U.S. manufacturing of next-generation
cargo handling equipment can be rapidly expanded.
Given these challenges, Ports America and NAWE will continue to
engage with Congress to find flexibility in the IRA to account for the
realistic costs, timelines, and U.S. equipment availability to achieve
the Act's policy goals. While the IRA is outside this Subcommittee's
jurisdiction, we appreciate the members' support for our efforts. We
will keep you apprised of these implementation challenges as they
directly impact the U.S. maritime supply chain.

In closing, I want to thank you all for inviting me to share
updates and concerns on these critical issues that impact our industry.
I am truly grateful for your support of American marine terminal
operators in ensuring resilient maritime supply chain and safe working
environment for our waterfront workforce. I am happy to respond to any
questions you may have.

Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you very much.
Mr. Allen, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM H. ``BUDDY'' ALLEN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, AMERICAN COTTON SHIPPERS ASSOCIATION

Mr. Allen. Thank you very much.
Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and members of
the subcommittee, thank you for holding this hearing. I'm
honored to have the opportunity to contribute my testimony and
the perspective of the American Cotton Shippers Association or
ACSA.
ACSA is a trade association primarily made up of cotton
merchants founded in 1924. Our members handle the vast majority
of U.S. cotton and foreign growths of cotton traded around the
world.
Our services consist of merchandising, delivery logistics,
and risk management. Simply put, we buy cotton from farmers,
and sell and deliver it to yarn spinners in the U.S. and around
the world.
We harmonize our customers' very different needs while
managing many of their risk, including price, time,
transportation, currency, geopolitics, and quality. With
approximately 85 percent of U.S. cotton exported in a
containerized and nonfungible manner, a functional and reliable
intermodal supply chain that provides adequate service to
exporters is mandatory to support overall risk management and
U.S. competitiveness in the global marketplace.
During the supply chain crisis that stemmed from the COVID-
19 pandemic, our members experienced unprecedented challenges
and risk. Cotton is produced and concentrated in our country's
interior and moved intermodally to domestic mills or ports of
export around the world. Efficient performance requires harmony
in sequencing and executing appointments with warehousemen,
equipment providers, draymen, rail providers, ocean shippers,
and terminal operators. Challenges at each point within our
industry's procedures created collective dysfunction.
Our industry has enjoyed a long and fruitful relationship
with ocean carriers. We are not here today to assign blame to
any single party for these events. We must work together to
develop practical solutions moving forward.
We believe that meaningful structural changes must be made
to prevent similar dysfunction from occurring. Our view is that
current relief in our supply chain is solely based on global
economic downturn that curtailed consumption of goods and
related volumes of inbound cargo.
Inundation has been replaced with elasticity in our supply
chain. This reprieve is temporary. Our economy will strengthen,
cargo volumes will increase, and we must capitalize on this
opportunity to prepare for renewed cargo saturation within our
supply chain.
ACSA applauds Congress and the Federal Maritime Commission
or FMC for the passage and aggressive implementation of the
Ocean Shipping Reform Act, referred to as OSRA. Key elements of
ACSA policy positions are addressed in OSRA, including the
categorical denial of service to exporters, reasonableness when
levying fees, and choice in the procurement of chassis.
The results of OSRA's implementation, related rulemaking,
and administrative processes are pending and appear to be, in
our opinion, of varying value. We believe that OSRA will likely
fall short of providing the needed assurance exporters seek
concerning the availability of service when economic conditions
favor empty sailings or imports.
Concerning detention and demurrage, we find value in the
documentation regime created by FMC, although we request
further establishment of causation in these submissions.
ACSA is supportive of FMC's recent decision of denial of
choice in chassis procurement for merchant haulage is
unreasonable and in violation of the Shipping Act, a decision
that has been broadly advocated for by an extensive coalition
of importers, exporters, and their service providers. We also
want to flag the importance of OSHA's prescribed study on best
practices for chassis. This should be done in a comprehensive
manner.
ACSA was a proponent of creating the National Shipper
Advisory Committee and is supportive of their recommendations
to the FMC. Specifically, we endorse measures to bring clarity
to jurisdictional questions and expanded oversight to FMC
throughout the entirety of maritime bills of lading, the
establishment of uniform and reasonable terms concerning cargo
receiving, and active steps to enhance data visibility and
integrity.
In addition to the reform and commercial practices outlined
in my testimony, I'd like to acknowledge ACSA's commitment to
the development of a modernized culture in containerized
shipping--one that embraces digitalization and the utility of a
blockchain ledger to streamline data management and expand
opportunities for global cotton merchandising.
In conclusion, I would be remiss not to acknowledge how
valuable our experience working with the FMC has been in recent
years. Given their size and given their resources, they have
been asked to punch above their weight class throughout this
process. I'm pleased to report that they are doing so while
maintaining active engagement with stakeholders and seeking
equitable outcomes that will promote a sound supply chain. We
hope this will be taken into consideration as FMC appeals for
critical resources to manage their expanding scope.
Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity to testify. I
look forward to answering your questions.

TESTIMONY OF MARIO CORDERO, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, PORT OF LONG
BEACH

Mr. Cordero. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
OK, here we go, all right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Webster and Ranking Member Carbajal, thank you for
inviting me to testify before the subcommittee today regarding
the state of maritime transportation supply chain issues.
My name is Mario Cordero, and I am the executive director
of the Port of Long Beach. The Port of Long Beach is the
premier U.S. gateway for transpacific trade, and nearly 40
percent of the container cargo entering the United States comes
through the Port of Long Beach and our neighbor, the Port of
Los Angeles.
The port welcomes the largest vessels in operation and is
the Nation's leading export port with more than 1.4 million
TEUs of loaded exports that have been moved. The port is
building some of the most modern and sustainable marine
facilities in the world, and we are committed to a zero-
emission future.
We all remember not so long ago when ships were waiting in
the San Pedro Bay Complex for days before they were able to
unload their vessels. While trade has slowed, we need to take
into consideration the past and not make the mistakes of the
past, and take action to ensure that we do not have supply
chain interruptions in the future.
Recognizing the need for technology solutions that would
enable terminal operators, ocean carriers, and shippers to
efficiently coordinate the movement of goods, the port
developed the Supply Chain Information Highway, a digital
solution that provides shippers and the supply chain with data
that can be integrated into their own systems.
Congress' passage of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act will be
a catalyst to ensure goods move efficiently through our ports.
As a former Chairman of the FMC, I am well aware of the balance
that the FMC must strike by enabling competition among ocean
carriers and terminal operators, while protecting shippers and
consumers from unfair practices.
OSRA will give the FMC additional authority to promote the
growth of U.S. exports through an ocean transportation system
that is competitive, economic, and efficient.
The Port of Long Beach is in the midst of a $2.6 billion
program of capital improvements for the next decade. New grant
programs create opportunities to secure funds for projects that
will put more containers on rail, reduce truck traffic, and
reduce carbon emissions.
The port has benefited greatly from the Port Infrastructure
Development Program. Most recently, the port secured FY 2022
funding for $30.1 million to deploy the Nation's largest fleet
of manually operated, zero-emission cargo handling equipment at
the Long Beach Container Terminal.
PIDP funds, however, do fall short of what is necessary.
PIDP is oversubscribed at the rate of four to one, and I call
on Congress to fully fund the PIDP at its $750 million
authorization level.
Permitting delays are also making the program more
difficult, such as MARAD's unnecessary barriers that prevent it
from using the categorical exclusions of other U.S. DOT modal
agencies. Congress should require U.S. DOT to update its
regulations to allow modal agencies to use the same categorical
exclusions.
We also have concerns about the level of data that's
requested by the port performance reporting requirements. We
are interested in exploring how we can coordinate data-sharing
efforts in place through U.S. DOT's FLOW initiative and our
Supply Chain Information Highway.
The Port of Long Beach is investing in a state-of-the-art
rail facility--a Pier B On-Dock Support Facility, which will
enhance on-dock rail capacity and expedite cargo movement. We
are building the $1.5 billion project in phases and are
pursuing competitive grants for Federal funds from the U.S.
DOT.
I have six recommendations as follows. One, encourage an
investment in technology so that the shippers, ocean carriers,
container terminal operators, and trucking companies are able
to efficiently plan and schedule their operations to prevent
bottlenecks. In essence, maximizing digital transformation.
Two, encourage the supply chain to operate within a 24/7
framework, when needed, to reduce bottlenecks and promote
efficiency.
Three, direct Federal funding to projects that will
facilitate goods movement and reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
such as the Mega program.
Four, I ask Congress to fully fund the PIDP at its $750
million authorization level. It will take more than $2 billion
to achieve our goals of zero-emission cargo handling equipment
by 2030 and zero-emission drayage trucks by 2035.
Five, likewise, funds in the IIJA and IRA directed to
reducing emissions at ports are invaluable and will spur
investments to expedite port electrification.
And last, continue to support the required resources to the
FMC to ensure a competitive and reliable international ocean
transportation supply system.
In conclusion, I appreciate the opportunity to testify
before the subcommittee. This is an exciting time, in terms of
technology and innovation, to enable U.S. ports to be true
economic drivers. I am happy to offer my views and look forward
to any questions the committee may ask. Thank you, Mr. Chairman
and Ranking Member.
[Mr. Cordero's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Mario Cordero, Executive Director, Port of Long
Beach
Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, thank you for inviting
me to testify before this Subcommittee today regarding the state of
maritime transportation supply chain issues. My name is Mario Cordero
and I am the Executive Director of the Port of Long Beach.
The Port of Long Beach (Port) was on the frontline of experiencing
supply chain disruptions, but has also been at the forefront of making
transformational investments in infrastructure and technology that not
only have addressed supply chain issues but also reduced emissions from
port operations. As the former Chairman of the Federal Maritime
Commission (FMC), I also have first-hand experience with balancing the
regulatory regime ensuring the efficient and nondiscriminatory movement
of goods by ocean carriers. I look forward to sharing my views on what
we have done at the Port of Long Beach to facilitate goods movement and
how Congress can ensure ports are able to make critical investments in
infrastructure that enable efficient, and ultimately zero emissions
port operations.
I. Background
The Port of Long Beach is the premier U.S. gateway for trans-
Pacific trade and a trailblazer in innovative goods movement, safety,
environmental stewardship and sustainability. Nearly forty percent of
the container cargo entering the U.S. comes through the Port of Long
Beach and our neighbor, the Port of Los Angeles. As one of the busiest
container seaports in the United States, the Port handles trade valued
at $200 billion annually and supports 2.6 million jobs across the
nation and more than 575,000 in Southern California. Altogether, the
Port generates $374 billion in total economic output across the U.S.
economy and $46 billion in local/state and federal tax revenues
annually.
The Port of Long Beach welcomes the largest vessels in operation,
serving 175 shipping lines with connections to 217 seaports around the
world. In 2022, the Port handled more than 9 million twenty-foot
equivalent units (TEU), achieving the second-best year in its history.
The Port of Long Beach remains the nation's leading export port for a
second consecutive year with more than 1.4 million TEUs of loaded
exports moved. As part of an industry-leading $2.6 billion capital
improvement program this decade, the Port is building some of the most
modern, efficient and sustainable marine facilities in the world to
accommodate larger ships and move cargo faster, while generating
thousands of new jobs.
The Port is also committed to a zero-emissions future--testing and
deploying new technology and infrastructure, including zero-emission
terminal equipment, a microgrid project, zero-emission cargo handling
vehicles and a blueprint for broad use of electric vehicles.
This month, the Port of Long Beach announced its participation in a
new effort between California and Japan to collaborate on strategies
aimed at cutting planet-warming pollution at seaports and establishing
green shipping corridors. The letter of intent, signed in Tokyo during
a trade mission to Japan led by California Lieutenant Governor Eleni
Kounalakis, is part of a series of international partnerships the Port
is engaged in to tackle climate change and improve air quality. The
Port is already engaged in a similar agreement with the Port of Kobe
and is collaborating with the nation of Singapore on a green and
digital shipping corridor that will focus on low- and zero-carbon ship
fuels, as well as digital tools to support deployment of low- and zero-
carbon ships.
II. Supply Chain Issues
We all remember not long ago when ships were waiting in the San
Pedro Bay Port Complex for days before they were able to unload their
vessels. At the same time, exporters were unable to ship their goods
out of the United States and manufacturers were waiting weeks and
sometimes months for parts or finished goods to arrive. While trade has
slowed following the record-breaking numbers of last year, it is
important that we learn from the past and take action to ensure we do
not have supply chain interruptions in the future. I would like to
address some of the initiatives that have been key to addressing supply
chain challenges and offer recommendations on what more we should be
doing.
1. Implementation of Technology Platforms
Recognizing the need for a technology solution that would enable
terminal operators, ocean carriers and shippers to efficiently
coordinate the movement of goods through the Port, the Port of Long
Beach developed the Supply Chain Information Highway. The project is a
digital solution that provides shippers and the supply chain with data
that can be integrated into their own systems, enabling them to track
cargo from origin to destination and make better operational decisions.
This digital infrastructure should enable shippers to better schedule
container pick-ups at the Port based on real-time information regarding
when ships will arrive at the Port and be unloaded. The Port of
Oakland, the Northwest Seaport Alliance, a marine cargo operating
partnership of the ports of Seattle and Tacoma, the Port of New York/
New Jersey, the Port of Miami, the South Carolina State Ports
Authority, the Port of Hueneme and the Utah Inland Port Authority are
collaborating with the Port of Long Beach on the Supply Chain
Information Highway. The goal is to offer access to data that will
result in increased delivery visibility for authorized supply chain
partners nationwide.
The Port appreciates the Biden-Harris Administration's recognition
and support to invest in projects like the Supply Chain Information
Highway and the U.S. Department of Transportation's major supply chain
initiative, Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW), to help speed
up delivery times and reduce consumer costs.
In June of 2022, Governor Gavin Newsom signed the California Budget
Act of 2022, which included a one-time investment of thirty million
dollars that will support direct cloud-based port data system
development at California's containerized ports and support emerging
data aggregation and analysis to support port operations.
Investment by the federal government in developing common data
standards to facilitate freight movement is an important part of
bringing the supply chain industry into the 21st century. Together,
they are clearing obstacles for much needed coordination across the
supply chain to make goods movement more efficient.
2. 24/7 Operations
I also have been a leading proponent of ports operating 24/7 to
reduce bottlenecks and create efficiencies. President Biden announced
his support for this effort in the fall of 2021.
Dockworkers, terminal operators and railroad labor took this mantra
to heart during the height of port congestion. Thanks to their
unwavering commitment, we did not shut down our operations amidst the
pandemic. They stepped up and helped us move 1 million more containers
in 2021 than previous years.
Unfortunately, implementing 24/7 operations is a work in progress
since it must be coordinated with container terminal operators,
shippers, trucking companies and warehouses. This has happened at ports
in other parts of the world and the U.S. needs to catch up.
3. Reasonable Regulation by the FMC
Congress' passage of the bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act
(OSRA) gives the FMC greater oversight over international ocean
carriers that, among other things, should ensure that goods move
efficiently through ports. Having previously served as Chairman of the
FMC, I am well aware of the balance the FMC must strike between
enabling competition among ocean carriers and terminal operators, while
also protecting shippers and ultimately consumers from unfair
practices. OSRA will give the FMC additional authority to promote the
growth and development of U.S. exports and businesses through an ocean
transportation system that is competitive, economical, efficient, and
one that brings strategic advantages to the U.S. OSRA seems to strike
that balance and I commend Congress for its leadership in developing a
compromise package of reforms.
OSRA came as a result of trying times in the industry, with a focus
on preparing the maritime transportation system for the future, while
addressing inefficiencies and disruption within the supply chain. These
changes are still being implemented and the industry has been an active
participant in the rulemaking process surrounding many of OSRA's
provisions.
The American Association of Port Authorities and its members have
been clear during the OSRA detention and demurrage rulemaking that
changes to the way these charges are billed to motor carriers should
not upend the status quo. Prohibiting motor carriers from being billed
for these charges risks congestion and slowdowns.
4. Investment in Infrastructure
The Port of Long Beach is in the midst of a $2.6 billion program of
capital improvements over the next 10 years. The funding increases and
new competitive grant programs in the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act (IIJA) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) create opportunities
for the Port to secure funds for priority projects that will put more
containers on rail and reduce truck traffic as well as reduce carbon
emissions from port operations.

Port Infrastructure Development Program. The Port of Long
Beach and other ports around the country have benefitted from the Port
Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP), which provides funding for a
broad range of infrastructure at ports and enables public ports to
partner with their container terminal operators to deliver
infrastructure improvements through public private partnerships. Most
recently, the Port of Long Beach secured fiscal year 2022 funding of
$30.1 million to deploy the nation's largest fleet of manually
operated, zero-emissions cargo handling equipment at a single marine
terminal. The project will replace diesel yard tractors at Long Beach
Container Terminal with approximately 60 electric human-operated yard
tractors and includes construction of electric equipment charging
stations with energy efficiency-enhancing software, training for
operators and maintenance personnel, and installation of software
equipment to streamline cargo-handling operations within the terminal.
PIDP is delivering record levels of funding to the port
industry, with over $700 million awarded last year. However, the
funding levels still fall short of what is necessary. PIDP is
oversubscribed at a rate of over 4:1. There are so many more critical
projects across the country that are going unfunded. I call on Congress
to fully fund PIDP at its $750 million authorization level.
Permitting delays are also making the program more difficult
for ports. There are bipartisan steps Congress can take to get shovels
in the ground faster without sacrificing environmental protection. For
example, the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) has unnecessary
barriers that prevent it from using the categorical exclusions of other
U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) modal agencies, like the
Federal Railroad Administration or Federal Highways Administration.
Congress should require USDOT to update its regulations to allow MARAD
and all modal agencies to use the same categorical exclusions, freeing
up staff resources to focus on more.
An area we need further coordination with MARAD and Bureau of
Transportation Statistics on is Port Performance Reporting
requirements. We have concerns about the level of data that is
requested, some of which is proprietary and terminal-specific. We are
also interested in exploring how we can coordinate data sharing efforts
already in place or under development through USDOT's FLOW initiative
and the Port's Supply Chain Information Highway. This would help to
address managing resources related to data collection, synthesis, and
sharing. How we resolve this issue has implications for implementing
projects through PIDP, particularly zero emission infrastructure and
tenant-led improvements.

Funding for On-Dock Rail. The Pier B On-Dock Rail Support
Facility will enhance on-dock rail capacity and expedite the movement
of cargo. We are building the $1.567 billion project in phases and are
pursuing competitive grants for federal funds from the Department of
Transportation. The Pier B Rail Program is a project of national
significance that will reduce port congestion, increase cargo velocity
and enhance rail connectivity with key inland points. Together, these
benefits will strengthen supply chain resilience and complement private
sector investments such as the planned Barstow International Gateway
project announced by BNSF Railway on October 1, 2022. Shifting cargo
movements to trains will reduce greenhouse gases and other harmful
emissions that disproportionally impact port-adjacent communities.
Furthermore, the construction and future operation of the project will
create good paying jobs for American workers.
III. Recommendations to Spur Further Investment at Ports
While volumes of goods moving through ports may be down temporarily
in light of the current economic climate, this is not a time to be
complacent. We should learn from the past and invest now to ensure that
we do not have supply chain issues in the future. I have the following
recommendation for the Subcommittee:

Encourage investment in technology that provides
transparency and an open platform so that shippers, ocean carriers,
container terminal operators and trucking companies are able to
efficiently plan and schedule their operations to prevent bottlenecks.

Encourage the supply chain to operate 24/7 when needed to
reduce bottlenecks and promote efficiency.

Direct federal funding to projects that will facilitate
goods movement and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Congress should
direct more money to the National Infrastructure Project Assistance
program (known as Mega grants), which funds complex projects that will
have a significant effect on the economy--such as the Pier B on-dock
rail project. A project like the Pier B project will benefit the entire
country since goods from the Port end up in literally every
Congressional District in the United States, and projects that have
national significance such as Pier B should be prioritized for funding.

Congress should continue to recognize the benefits of the
PIDP program since ports are critical economic engines, while at the
same time they historically have been polluters. The Port of Long Beach
is known as the Green Port as we have made significant strides to cut
greenhouse gas emissions and tackle the effects of climate change. It
will take more than $2 billion to achieve our goals of zero emission
cargo handling equipment by 2030 and zero emission drayage trucks by
2035. Ports like the Port of Long Beach that are making significant
investments to operate as ``clean ports'' should receive federal
funding to enable further investment. I also ask Congress to fully fund
PIDP at its $750 million authorization level.

Likewise, funds in the IIJA and IRA directed to reducing
emissions at ports are invaluable and will spur investments to expedite
port electrification.
Of note, between 2010 and 2020, West Coast ports lagged 10 to
1 in federal investments in comparison to Gulf and East Coast ports,
the latter having received more than $11 billion compared to just over
$1.2 billion for the West Coast.
On the rail side, the Canadian government has invested
heavily in its west coast rail system that has resulted in taking away
approximately 22% of business from our U.S. West Coast ports. In
addition, the Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd, recently received
regulatory approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
United States for its acquisition of Kansas City Southern, thus
allowing a foreign company to strategically create the only single-line
railroad linking the United States, Mexico and Canada. Investments in
rail and on-dock rail infrastructure projects at West Coast ports are
critical to remaining competitive, growing our national economy, and
creating a more efficient, environmentally sound and faster method of
moving goods.
IV. Conclusion
I appreciate the opportunity to testify before the Subcommittee.
This is an exciting time in terms of technology and innovation to
enable our ports to be true economic drivers. I am happy to offer my
views and look forward to answering your questions.

Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you very much. We will go to
questions, and I will ask my questions first.
Mr. Darr, you expressed concerns about FMC's proposed
rulemaking that would limit detention and demurrage charges for
certain entities and the potential impact on the incentive
principle. What would you like to see as a better alternative,
and how can we find balance between incentivizing the movement
of cargo while ensuring the charges are fair?
Mr. Darr. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I think
we're all in agreement here, it sounds like among the
witnesses, that detention and demurrage has an important role
to play in ensuring fluidity.
So, it has some role. The question is: What's the right
framework? And the challenge that we raised, with regard to the
rulemaking, is that the proposed rule seems to abandon the
incentive principle that the FMC had previously embraced, which
basically judges it on a fact-specific, case-by-case basis on
if a charge actually improves fluidity and resiliency in the
supply chain, and instead specifies specific parties that can
be charged and those that cannot.
And the real fundamental problem with that is it could
leave you in a situation where, in many cases, a party gets
charged that is not in a position to actually improve that
fluidity and other cases where the party that could actually
make a difference cannot be charged.
So, it would seem to miss the mark on the direction that it
is headed right now with--and certainly that can't be what
Congress actually intended from my perspective, because I think
the intention was to improve fluidity.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Leech, do you have anything to
add to that?
Mr. Leech. I concur with that, and I think I clarified that
pretty well in my oral statement, Mr. Chairman. And one of the
distinctions I would like to make very clearly amongst the
committee is the demurrage on terminal.
Terminal demurrage, as I call it, is just storage. And when
goods are moved through the transport chain, terminal, off
terminal, to destination, there is storage along that way for
those goods, whether it's in a warehouse, a depot, or a
terminal.
So, there is no distinction, in terms of that as a
reasonable charge. And one way to facilitate better engagement
is for shippers to directly engage with MTOs who have that
capacity inside of their asset base and can offer different
service levels under different pricing levels.
So, part of the issue we have as an industry is MTOs are
operating underneath a supply chain that's being managed end-
to-end typically by a liner company.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Allen, do you have anything to
add to that?
Mr. Allen. I would simply say that the amount of erroneous
charges and the lack of an efficient appeal process begged for
reform and improvement. Is this perfect? Arguably not. What is
it exactly is still somewhat to be determined, but we believe
that significant progress has been made.
Mr. Webster of Florida. The Shipping Act provides for
certain anti-trust exemptions for ocean carriers. Can you talk
about the role of these anti-trust exemptions and how they are
used in the industry? What would be the impact of removing
them?
Anybody want to respond to that? Yes.
Mr. Darr. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd certainly be happy
to comment.
First of all, I'd like to put it in perspective. I checked
this morning to make sure my recollection was accurate, and of
our 700 or so ships in our network, we have 86 that are
actually in the 2M alliance, which is our alliance.
So, you need to be careful not to overstate what role the
alliances play in the overall picture and in the market,
because it can be kind of distorted if you're not careful with
the numbers.
The reason that the alliances are very useful and vessel
sharing agreements, which is a broader term which is used
sometimes in very small agreements too, is that it provides
additional capacity because you can better utilize the
available capacity that's out there.
You can provide more services to more ports, particularly
smaller ports that might not end up getting services at all if
a carrier had to rely simply on their own very capital-
intensive resources to serve those. And the efficiencies that
are gained, not just as far as managing cost, but also
efficiency with energy consumption and therefore, greenhouse
gas emissions are minimized, that would change.
And those additional costs that come from that ultimately
would find their way back into the market if the VSAs were not
allowable in some form, as we understand them today. They serve
a very valuable purpose and particularly with smaller ports and
niche shippers.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you very much. My time is
expired. OK. Mr. Carbajal, you are recognized for your
questions.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Allen, in your testimony you expressed concern
regarding the FMC's ``refusal to deal'' rulemaking. What do you
believe should be the result of rulemaking, and are there any
issues Congress should be considering?
Mr. Allen. Thank you, Mr. Carbajal. As we can all imagine,
this is a complex matter to resolve. I enjoyed the exchange
this subcommittee had with Chairman Maffei last week where he
testified if you built a bridge in the interior it would help
him. We tend to agree with that. I think all of these witnesses
appreciate the complexity.
With that said, we think there are some commonsense
improvements. We do desire some form of assurance or mandate
that in all economic conditions, exporters, particularly
agricultural exporters like our members, would be afforded
access to services that we depend upon, and we're very good
customers of our colleagues here at the table today.
With that said, we think there's some low-hanging fruit in
the cultural practices within the U.S. that don't necessarily
cost a lot of money, or time, or change, if we can work
together.
One is coming up with a reasonable regime for cargo
receiving that's consistent. When carriers are sharing space in
the alliances that Mr. Darr just described, if we could find
harmony in their procedures and requirements, as well as the
terminal operators, it would bring great visibility and
opportunity for us to make our scheduling.
When we're weeks out at interior warehouses and days out
from change with ocean carriers, it just simply does not
synchronize. At the same time, data sharing, visibility, and
communication is ripe for improvement.
We need every measure to open systems for equipment use and
introduce additional assets. And the thing that I would flag
for this subcommittee to please consider focusing on is
jurisdictional clarity--jurisdictional clarity across the full
entirety of maritime bill of lading. Through what extent is it
governed, or is the oversight provided by the Federal Maritime
Commission, and at what point is it the Surface Transportation
Board?
And we would ask an expansion of the Federal Maritime
Commission's jurisdiction to cover the entirety of that
maritime move.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Mr. Cordero, you have highlighted the work the Port of Long
Beach has done to reduce emissions at the port. By investing in
emissions reduction, are you losing out on efficiency, or is
the port becoming more efficient at the same time?
Mr. Cordero. Thank you, Ranking Member Carbajal, for the
question. And my answer to that question is, there is no
question that we are creating more efficiency in my view.
So, I think, again, over the many years that the port has
moved forward, pursuant to the Green Port Policy that was
initially passed back in 2005, I think that we have been
environmental stewards and operational stewards in terms of
proving to the fact that not only have we increased, in terms
of our ability of how we move cargo in good times, but also how
efficient we do it in a sustainable fashion in reducing
emissions.
So, I think, again, and I will say our partner in doing
this at the Port of L.A. and the San Pedro Bay Complex, I think
it's a gateway that has proven the fact that the efficiency is
in fact further with our reducing emissions gameplan, in terms
of going towards zero emissions.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Mr. Darr, in your testimony you mentioned MSC's goal of
achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. How will investments in
ports from the funds in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
support MSC's goal and benefit industry overall? What is the
magnitude of shoreside investments needed to bring on new
alternative fuels?
Mr. Darr. Thank you, sir. The role of shoreside investments
is key, in part minimizing the amount of wasted transit time
and moving to a system that's much more of a just-in-time port
arrival, rather than a hurry-up-and-wait, sort of, port arrival
system, could make an enormous difference.
We've kind of done that on the west coast to relieve
pressure on the anchorage, but I was literally sitting in
Glasgow at the climate conference there when we enacted that as
an industry initiative, and it made a huge difference, as well,
in efficiency of how we operate the ships.
The fuel itself, that energy transition will be between $1
and $2 trillion at a minimum to actually help the shipping
industry fully transition to net zero by the fuels in 2050.
So, investments in fuel development, fuel infrastructure,
delivery, and making them available particularly on the largest
of the trade lanes could make a huge difference sooner rather
than later, and we would certainly encourage all of those types
of investments, as well as those in terminal efficiency.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. I am almost out of time, so, I am
going to ask my question. If you could submit the answer for
the record?
Mr. Cordero, I am greatly concerned by the impact of
emissions and poor air quality on the oftentimes disadvantaged
communities that live around ports.
Can you discuss, not necessarily discuss, but forward some
information, some of the environmental justice work the Port of
Long Beach has done and how smaller ports can replicate that?
If you could submit that for the record, that would be
great.
Mr. Chairman, I am out of time. I yield back.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Babin, you have 5 minutes.
Dr. Babin. Yes, sir. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I
want to thank all the witnesses for being here today. I
appreciate it.
The U.S. maritime industry keeps our Nation's economy
running. The ongoing growth seen in southeast Texas is a great
example of that. We have some great ports there, including the
number one port in the Nation by tonnage, the Port of Houston,
which is in my district.
The entire Houston Ship Channel is busy day and night, the
conduit for shippers sending and receiving goods to and from
all around the world. COVID brought new attention to port
operations in ocean shipping, shining a light on the importance
of an industry that many folks, in fact, I think most of our
country, simply doesn't understand.
Last Congress, we tried to address both new and
longstanding issues with our ocean transportation system when
we passed OSRA, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act. However, even as
we have heard so much about supply chain issues and the need to
improve the status quo, I have heard concerns from industry
about the direction that regulators want to move forward with.
My colleagues and I are all too familiar with unelected
Federal employees in Washington taking a completely different
direction from the intent of Congress, resulting in new,
unintended problems rather than the intended solutions.
So, Mr. Leech, thanks for your testimony earlier. Given
your background and industry knowledge, you should be well-
qualified to answer these questions.
Last week, FMC Chairman Maffei testified that the
Commission must avoid actions that would disincentivize the
timely retrieval of cargo from marine terminals. Do you believe
that if cargo owners are given free weekend and holiday storage
at marine terminals, that it would disincentivize cargo owners
from removing their cargo in a timely manner?
And also would the resulting Monday traffic increase be
potentially dangerous?
Mr. Leech. In response, I've made some commentary already
in my statement----
Dr. Babin [interposing]. Right.
Mr. Leech [continuing]. Regarding this issue, and clearly,
we are very clear to the industry, in terms of the disincentive
principle and the availability of cargo and giving free,
another free use of the asset to the cargo community ultimately
is a disincentive.
We want to encourage pickups. We want to encourage
fluidity. We can manage those parties who wish to have an
engagement, a long-stay engagement. We can segregate and
operationally change what we do to manage efficiently and
provide a service, but we need to know about it. There needs to
be an open channel of communication.
Dr. Babin. Would the resulting Monday increase in traffic
be potentially dangerous too?
Mr. Leech. That's very difficult to predict.
Dr. Babin. OK. All right. Marine container terminals lease
waterfront property in most U.S. ports and that property is
typically finite.
When containers are not picked up in a timely manner, how
does that affect your operations?
Mr. Leech. Typically, the longer the container stays, the
denser the facility becomes, the more nonrevenue work we do to
manage an operation, which reduces fluidity.
So, it directly affects capacity and capability.
Dr. Babin. Congestion will be back sooner or later, and we
need to get away from the idea that terminals are waterfront
warehouses. How do you suggest we change this perception?
Mr. Leech. We in the industry, from a terminal operator
perspective, are flexible to be a solution provider to storage,
but it is something we need to plan for in advance and a
dialogue with the cargo owner and not be caught with
unexpected.
Again, to manage that capacity, manage fluidity, we can
provide solutions with the right sharing of information.
Dr. Babin. Absolutely. I still have another minute, so, I
will yield that back to the whole committee.
Mr. Webster of Florida. It is too hard to divide. Mr.
Larsen?
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thanks. I appreciate that. One of
my questions was asked by Mr. Carbajal's last one, which Mr.
Cordero will get back for the record, so, I don't want you to
answer that. You will get back to him for the record.
I want you, though, for Mr. Cordero, sorry, I can't read
that far without my glasses----
Mr. Allen [interrupting]. Allen.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Allen. Mr. Allen, to discuss two
things you alluded to and just very briefly, your
recommendation to encourage investment in technology that
provides transparency on an open platform that shippers,
carriers, and such can use to plan and schedule.
Mr. Cordero, can you select that right now? It was an issue
that came up obviously during COVID. Is there a platform to be
used right now that provides better transparency to all the
players about where things are, when they are going to be
there?
Mr. Cordero. Yes, Congressman. Individual stakeholders, be
it carriers, be it the terminals, or truckers, the movement in
terms of augmenting technology to achieve transparency and
visibility is a very aggressive one.
So, there are platforms. I think from the Port of Long
Beach's perspective, I think what we're doing is putting
together a system that is integrated, so, no matter what
platform you use, again, it will be integrating into a system
and that everybody can participate.
So, I think, again, the answer to the question is, yes. And
it's, again, I think what's in the future, in the next 5 years,
the shape of things to come is that we are going to be better,
in terms of how fast this is moving.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, I think we heard last year,
during some testimony, that it is not integrated. There are a
lot of platforms, but there is not a picture that folks can
use.
Mr. Allen, can you talk a little bit about where you think
the technology ought to head?
Mr. Allen. Well, I think you have laid it out very well,
Mr. Larsen. And Mr. Cordero, I'll commend the Port of Long
Beach for being the tip of the spear on leading this effort.
I hope that we can build continuity in the systems and we
can integrate them. To your point, this needs to be done in a
comprehensive manner across terminal operators' ports and ocean
carriers so that we can utilize that information as efficiently
as possible in one place.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. That is fair enough. I appreciate
that, and I will yield back 2 minutes and 43 seconds.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Ezell?
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Leech, thank you for your testimony today before our
subcommittee. Last week, Ports America announced a critical
agreement with the Port of Gulfport. This agreement will
significantly benefit my constituents and add value to one of
the gulf coast's most underutilized gateway ports.
Can you begin by talking about the importance of private-
public partnerships, such as the one Ports America has at the
Port of Gulfport, to our Nation's supply chain and critical
infrastructure?
Mr. Leech. Thank you. Yes, in terms of the public-private
partnerships, which is what we've endeavored to put forward and
now agreed with the Port of Gulfport, provides leverage for us
to play a different role, more than just a service provider
doing stevedoring, we're moving into a space where we're
coinvesting and taking a role in the infrastructure
development, as well as the marketing of that facility and the
utility of that facility to a broader marketplace.
So, actively partnering with a port to be a steward of
those assets to develop that economic and trade platform. Not a
port, but an economic engine.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
Despite the impressive amount of annual imports and exports
that are handled at the Port of Gulfport, a shallow shipping
channel remains a challenge for local and regional importers
and exporters. What opportunities would be realized in the Port
of Gulfport if the Gulfport Shipping Channel was dredged to a
competitive depth?
Mr. Leech. The marine access is a critical issue for many
ports, not just Gulfport. But Gulfport, as you highlighted, is
in an uncompetitive position relative to its port peers in the
gulf.
And so, the opening up of marine access in an efficient
way, essentially opens the entire market for Gulfport to
compete with New Orleans, with Houston, with Mobile, that it
doesn't have the capacity to do today.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you. So, you agree that dredging projects,
in general, would lead to greater resilience in ports and
marine terminals, which also would prevent some further future
supply chain disruptions?
Mr. Leech. Yes, it's a critical element of our overall
strategy or what should be our overall strategy from a national
perspective is marine access to ensure that all ports can
compete with each other. And we have an obligation to create
resiliency through greater choice of port of entry for cargo.
The broader we have that base for both import and export
goods, the better we are, in terms of supply chain resiliency.
Trying to force through the entire import base for the entire
country through six or seven ports is not a sustainable future.
Mr. Ezell. Right. Thank you. Thank you again for your time
today, and I thank all the folks for coming out and testifying,
and we look closely to working with all of you to help create
some jobs on the Mississippi coast.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thanks so much. Mr. Garamendi.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act, I see Mr. Dusty Johnson here
and the pleasure of working with him to get that enacted.
There's an enforcement issue in that any effort by the FMC to
enforce the existing law or any future law would require them
to go to court first to get permission from the court to carry
out the enforcement. That's backwards.
No other independent agency has that requirement. They
issue a enforcement and then the entities that are affected by
that enforcement have the opportunity, if they disagree, to go
to court to get it overturned.
So, Mr. Leech, don't you think it is a good idea that the
FMC do it the same way as others? Other independent agencies?
Mr. Leech. I haven't examined this in close detail to
really----
Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. Well, you will because I'm
introducing a bill to require just that. How about you, Mr.
Darr? Don't you think it's a good idea that the FMC have the
same power as every other regulatory agency? That is to issue
an enforcement, and then if you don't like it, go to court.
Mr. Darr. So, my understanding is that the change that's
proposed would actually be limited to their review of the
competitive nature of agreements between carriers. And it's
important that an agency have authority to carry out whatever
they're tasked with, however, adjudication is a very
complicated matter for an agency, and it is even more
complicated to do correctly----
Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. So, you don't like the idea
that the FMC have the same enforcement mechanisms as others?
Mr. Darr. I'm----
Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. Other independent agencies?
Mr. Darr. I'm saying I don't know that it is the same, sir,
and I leave the judgment to Congress as to how much power to
vest in an agency.
Mr. Garamendi. Then you're neutral on it. Thank you.
Let's see, Mr. Allen, you said that you don't have access
to ships. What if the queuing of ships that are waiting to get
to port were to be done in such a way that those ships that
would take your product and other agricultural and other export
products, would get to the dock ahead of those that would not?
Do you think that is a good idea?
Mr. Allen. We reviewed that concept, Mr. Garamendi, and
appreciate you identifying ways to provide service for
exporters. We think that would be effective and should be
considered with the broad suite of ideas for additional steps
that may be considered going forward.
Mr. Garamendi. Very good. Then we will look for your
support, once again, as you did with the Ocean Shipping Reform
Act, as we deal with the queuing opportunity, which is a
nonregulatory thing, it is just simply if your ships are going
to take American cargo, you can go to the head of the line; if
you don't, you can wait at the outer harbor.
Let's see. Mr. Leech and Mr. Darr, do you believe that
international trade should be reciprocal? That is, if you want
to import, you also have to take exports?
Mr. Leech?
Mr. Leech. Well, it's not certainly part of our scope of
business. We're a service provider to handle all trade. We are
a facilitator, and we're indifferent. Our job is to ensure that
there is capacity and capability to export and import----
Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. I just want to get down to
the principle here. The principle that trade is reciprocal. If
importers enter the United States have access to the American
market, then the American exporters ought to also have access,
that is to export.
Mr. Darr, do you think that is a good principle?
Mr. Darr. In principle, our business is founded on that.
Mr. Garamendi. Perfect.
Mr. Darr. How to balance----
Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. Then you would support
legislation that would require such reciprocal nature that as
the ocean carriers, if you want to bring exports into the
United States, then you ought to be willing to take exports out
of the United States so that Mr. Allen and others would have
access to the space on your ships?
Mr. Darr. I think the details on how to do that would
matter.
Mr. Garamendi. Oh, yes, always the details----
Mr. Darr [interrupting]. But in principle----
Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. Well, there's going to be a
bill to give you the opportunity to look at those details.
Final point has to do with the anti-trust exemption that
the ocean shipping carriers have. Do you believe in free trade?
A capitalistic system of competition? All of you? Yes, yes,
yes? I suppose all of you would think that is a good idea.
Well, it just turns out that the ocean carriers are exempt
from the monopoly and the anti-trust laws of the United States,
and there ought to be a law that the ocean carriers are subject
to anti-trust laws like other parts of our economy.
Don't you think that is a good idea? Mr. Darr? Mr. Leech?
Mr. Darr. Sir, if you mean with regard to pricing? I----
Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. I mean, with regard to all
monopolistic exercises.
Mr. Darr. I'm not sure what that means.
Mr. Garamendi. I believe I am out of time.
Mr. Darr. But the vessel sharing----
Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. That means that the 1980
exemption from the anti-trust law be repealed.
Mr. Darr. I don't think that's a good idea. No, sir.
Mr. Garamendi. I thought you might not. I yield back.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you. Mr. Johnson?
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Well, I think you can see my
partner, John Garamendi, can be a dog with a bone when we are
trying to figure out what is the best way to regulate this
marketplace and ensure that American exporters are being
treated fairly and that we have the data and the authority for
the FMC to do a good job.
And I want to thank John, and frankly, everybody who has
helped us put together the Ocean Shipping Reform Act 2.0, which
is being introduced today and does address a number of the
issues that Mr. Garamendi talked about in his line of
questioning.
And I think we look forward to having another robust,
bipartisan success related to ocean shipping. Critically,
critically important.
So, Mr. Allen, I want to talk with you. You had mentioned
that you weren't sure that OSRA was going to provide enough
assurance to folks that they will have the capacity, they will
have the resources needed when the marketplace otherwise wants
empty exports.
Help me understand that a little bit more and, in
particular, did OSRA fall short someplace?
Mr. Allen. Well, the first thing I would say is that we
believe, when you consider the data that supports the total
volume of inbound cargo, and you then compare it to the spread
between import and export costs, you will see a direct
correlation to empty sailings. That concerns us.
On its face, we feel like there should be guardrails around
that. We do not know if OSRA creates those guardrails. As many
people have said, the implementation and regulatory regime
around OSRA is very much ongoing, and there will be complaints,
and there will be rulings, and there will be rules that stand
up over time.
Your exchange with Chairman Maffei last week, Mr. Johnson,
you suggested that this is a meal that may be consumed in
courses. I think it was around a bowl of cereal, and I tend to
agree with you.
And when we understand the impact that comes from OSRA, we
will have a better view to what needs to be done next. And I am
certain there is more work to be done and very grateful for the
energy in this room to do that work.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Well, since the second bowl of
Cheerios is being introduced today, Mr. Cordero, our bill does
address some of the things you have talked about, which is
having data standards and making sure we have got the
information we need to try to harmonize some of the data-
sharing efforts, and you have been involved in the DOT's FLOW
initiative.
Talk to us a little bit about where we should be headed
from a data-sharing and harmonization perspective?
Mr. Cordero. That's a great question, Congressman. And I
think the answer is that, as I mentioned before, I think it's
fair to say that every sector in the industry has their
respective platforms that are evolving, so, where we should be
heading is how do we integrate these platforms into one
integrated system?
And I think that's the key that I think we've received,
that is the Port of Long Beach, a lot of accolades from other
ports, initially, given that we just announced this just a year
ago or so.
So, I think that's the direction and the more funding that
we have for those opportunities, the better, because I think
we've gone beyond the question of proprietary interest issues.
Not that it's not there, but I think everybody has the
comfort that this has to move forward in a way to provide
visibility and transparency in the supply chain and this is
what, in fact, the pandemic surfaced of many issues of the lack
of visibility and transparency for the American shipper.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. I think you said that very
well. And we do need this information. The marketplace needs
this information to really be efficient and to well serve
American import and export interests.
You mentioned proprietary. I mean, help us--listen, we are
going to solve the problem, but give us some guidance on how do
we balance the need to protect proprietary information as well
as making sure we have enough granularity so that people can do
something with the data?
Mr. Cordero. Well, I think we're there. I only say that
because through technology, stakeholders have been convinced
that it's not about the proprietary interests, in terms of the
data sharing that we're requesting, everybody has a comfort now
that all we're seeking is information to further the visibility
and transparency of the cargo movement.
So, I think if the individual companies or sectors, whether
you're a trucking company, a BCO, or terminal, or a carrier, I
think they now have adjusted to the fact that this is not about
providing data that's not relevant to the visibility and
transparency issue.
So, we're there as opposed to where we were even 5 years
ago when that was a real concern.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Yes. We just--we have got to
have this information if we are going to have the system that
we deserve.
Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I yield, and thanks for the
subcommittee for letting me waive on. I'm grateful for your
indulgence, and I yield back.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Ms. Scholten, you are recognized
for 5 minutes.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you so much to
our witnesses for being before the committee today and
discussing such an important topic.
I am so proud to represent miles of beautiful Lake Michigan
shoreline on the west coast of Michigan, including the
wonderful Port of Muskegon. Ports play such an important role
on the Great Lakes and are lifelines to their communities.
Ranking Member Larsen mentioned last week, but I want to
stress again, the importance of the small ports set-aside under
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Port Infrastructure
Development Program, that it has to ensure the movement of
cargo between Canada and the U.S. on the Great Lakes.
One project funded under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
provided Monroe, Michigan, which sits on Lake Erie, an $11
million grant for funding in 2022, and for energy resilience to
build shore power and invest in the local waterfront.
I'm really looking forward to other projects following suit
just like this, and I'm wondering, Mr. Allen, can you please
talk about the importance of investing in small ports and
particularly the impact for your members and others in
agricultural?
Mr. Allen. Thank you, Congresswoman. I would just say, as
has been said already: The concept of moving cotton, in our
members' case or all commodities for U.S. agricultural
stakeholders, cannot be consolidated into three, or four, or
five, or six major hubs. We need a broader base.
We need to utilize your port and your district. We need to
utilize Mr. Ezell's Port of Gulfport as he's described. We see
opportunities in the near future for containerized shipping in
ports that we're not using now, and that excites us.
We can lower costs, we can add efficiency, we can increase
the competitiveness of U.S. agriculture if we can broaden our
base. We completely support that. Thank you for the question.
Ms. Scholten. Yes, that's wonderful. We would love to have
you out and take a look at the port.
My next question is for Mr. Cordero. Thank you so much. I
want to give you a kudos for your Port of Long Beach, one of
the most environmentally friendly in the country.
My district is over 2,000 miles from the Port of Long
Beach, but I can assure you that we have felt the effects of
inflation and supply chain related increases just as much. What
will broad investments in ports like those in the BIL and the
IRA do to increase the flow of cargo and therefore, some of the
inflationary conditions that have existed for the last few
years?
Mr. Cordero. That's a great question because for the Port
of Long Beach, as I mentioned, we are, at least for 2022, the
number one containerized export port. And just recently I had a
conversation with one of your constituents there from the dairy
industry. How important that market is as it comes to the San
Pedro Bay Complex, and in my case, the Port of Long Beach. So,
I think the answer to that question is, it's an unprecedented
funding for the supply chain that we are now receiving,
including for the intermodal facilities.
And we talk about inland ports, intermodal facilities are
just as important because again, at the end of the day, a
supply chain throughout the Nation is going to be crucial to
make this connectivity whether you're a small port, whether
you're an inland port, whether you're a waterway port, marine
transportation highway, or a seaport like the Port of Long
Beach.
So, I think, again, at the end of the day, the U.S.A. has a
big market in the global arena with regard to exports,
particularly ag, and protein, and dairy. So, I think, yes,
funding for intermodal facilities is just as important.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you so much.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the rest of my time.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Auchincloss.
Mr. Auchincloss. Thank you, Chairman.
So, I voted against the OSRA twice in the House precisely
because of concerns about the detention and demurrage charges
and what that would do to shippers and MTOs. The Senate
version, I got on board with finally because I thought that the
AAPA's recommendations for improvement were well taken and
hopefully would keep the incentive principle in place.
Unfortunately, we are seeing, to your excellent written
testimony, both of you, that it doesn't seem to be the case
right now. Unfortunately, they are going in the opposite
direction with broad classifications and Mr. Leech, in
particular, I liked your analogy of, for my simple politician's
mind of just long-term parking on a bridge.
And we don't want that. It is not a good use of the
capacity. I have been heartened to hear from Mr. Allen and from
you, Mr. Leech, though, it doesn't feel like we are that far
apart here. It really doesn't.
I hear from Mr. Allen, really a good faith desire to move
quickly in and out, but you want predictability, if I am
hearing you correctly, sir, and Mr. Leech, that you are willing
to provide some storage, but you need also some heads up on
that and then a market-based way of supplying it.
So, what, given this, given that we are like, I feel you
two are reaching out, trying to hold hands here, there it is,
the bridge. What can the FMC do to get that, to close this and
keep the incentive principle in place, which I think has served
us pretty well, recognizing that you, Mr. Allen, and your co-
travelers in the export industry do need some certainty?
What are the final steps here? I invite you both to
participate in a colloquy.
Mr. Leech. Allow me to weigh in first, and I've engaged the
FMC on this topic in the very same way. And that is partly the
recognition, and I highlighted it earlier, that the MTO has a
critical role to play, but how they engage, not simply as a
supplier to somebody else as a third party, but as an active
participant with direct commercial and product engagement with
that cargo owner, with that shipper, with the consignee.
That's the critical element here that needs to change. So,
it is in part about engagement and that we become an active
partner in providing a service, but it's also about the
information.
We all agree that data sets need to be better, there needs
to be better access. A cargo owner shouldn't have to go
uniquely to our portal to get information.
Mr. Auchincloss. Information is important. Incentives are
also very important, and we do want to keep those incentives in
place for demurrage and detention, pick them up, and bring them
back, fast.
Mr. Allen?
Mr. Allen. Again, we do want to move cargo fast, and we
want to take costs off the table. We want certainty, we want
choice, we want an open marketplace in the manner by which we
procure and utilize assets so that we can move as fast as
possible and reduce costs to our customers as much as possible.
At the same time, we incurred $1.3 billion worth of
unbudgeted costs during this timeframe--not all of which were
detention or demurrage, but certainly some were--and other
storage related malfunctions, carrying costs, and credit risks.
In addition to the monetary costs, U.S. agriculture lost market
share and faced reputational risk, and we simply must do a
better job of communicating so we can operate more efficiently
together.
Mr. Auchincloss. I can understand the frustrations that
would be there when you are picking up those kind of charges
for issues that are probably largely out of your control,
certainly during the pandemic. Couldn't that be addressed,
though, not with a broad exclusion of categories, but with just
faster resolution of specific claims?
Mr. Allen. Maybe. Sir, there are lots of elements to the
change in this regime of who is responsible, who has the burden
of proof. I think we are sending shockwaves through the
industry, and I think all participants in the industry are
going to be responsive, and we're going to be stronger because
of that.
Mr. Auchincloss. OK. Well, I want to make sure the FMC
hears now from a Democrat. We heard from Mr. Babin before as a
Republican, that we do need to get this right. The incentive
principle does matter, and it doesn't need to be adversarial.
I think there does seem to be strong aligned incentives
here. Finally, in the last 30 seconds, Mr. Darr, we have heard
in the previous line of questioning pressure to take our MTO
and our shipping plumbing in this country and use it as a
cudgel on trade-related issues. Do you want to comment
specifically on any dangers of politicizing our shipping
industry on trade disputes?
Mr. Darr. I think it's fraught with quite a bit of peril
and unintended consequences and some of, whether we like it or
not, some of the major shipping companies that the world relies
upon are state-backed or state-owned to some degree as well.
We face that competition every day. Given the right
framework, we'll continue to compete and compete successfully,
and we will continue to serve the commerce needs of the United
States, which is my country, and I'm very proud to work for a
company that believes in that every bit as much as I do.
Mr. Auchincloss. Thank you, sir. I yield back.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Van Drew, you are recognized
for 5 minutes.
Dr. Van Drew. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you all for
being here today.
In this Congress, one of my agendas is going to be to focus
on the impact, and you have heard me speak about it before,
that offshore wind industrialization has on the Atlantic
maritime supply chain.
Safe access to the east coast is essential to many maritime
users, including the maritime shipping industry, and all of you
are represented on this panel today. Unrestrained shore wind
threatens this safety.
In fact, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has
determined that the impacts of offshore wind on navigation and
vessel traffic, and this is the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, would be, quote, ``major,'' and that it would
increase, quote, ``the risk of collision, '' and could, quote,
``result in personal injury or loss of life and limb.'' The
reasons for this are obvious.
First, offshore wind leases obstruct maritime traffic lanes
and force vessels into tight bottlenecks.
Second, offshore wind structures interfere with
navigational radar. In 2022, the National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a report
concluding that offshore wind structures can interfere with
ship radar and with ship's navigation.
This is a result of the electromagnetic reflections from
wind, a name that you are all familiar with: the Doppler
effect. And it is caused by the spinning of the blades. And
let's understand, just off my east coast, what kind of presence
we are speaking about. We are speaking about thousands of
windmills.
We are speaking that each one of them would be 1,000 feet
high. We are speaking about millions, no embellishment,
millions of acres of ground used for this. Today I chose to
speak about this because it is appropriate for you, but you
also could talk about the environmental issues.
You could speak about the issues as related to the tourism
industry, as related to the fishing industry. I would love for
everybody to hear from some fishermen on what they are going
through. Some of them are going to lose their businesses
completely. Lose their businesses completely.
Our energy is going to be controlled by foreign countries,
over 50 percent of it, and it is going to change the entire
landscape. One thousand feet tall. Taller than Lady Liberty and
thousands of them. Imagine what it is going to look like.
Last week, I questioned the Maritime Administrator who
admitted that the Government has not scrutinized this issue. I
mean, she is for the issue, but still had to admit that we had
not even scrutinized it. I am hoping that with some of the work
that I am doing and others are doing now that we will.
I direct my questions to Mr. Bud Darr, executive director
of the Mediterranean Shipping Company, or known as MSC, also
here on behalf of the World Shipping Council.
Mr. Darr, you have an extraordinary breadth of maritime
experience, including service in the Navy Submarine Force, and
thank you for that, and the U.S. Coast Guard legal office.
Thank you for your service, and I hope you can provide some
information and some clarity on these issues, Mr. Darr. Is it
safe, let me put it this way: Is safe access to east coast
ports important to the maritime shipping industry? Is safe
access important?
Mr. Darr. Yes, sir, and thank you for your compliment. I
will say it was my absolute honor to serve.
Dr. Van Drew. I know. It is an honor, and we are honored
that you did.
Can physical bottlenecks impact the safety of maritime
operations?
Mr. Darr. Yes, sir.
Dr. Van Drew. Do large maritime shipping vessels rely on
radar for safe navigation?
Mr. Darr. Yes, sir. It's a very important component of
navigation.
Dr. Van Drew. Have you heard of the Doppler effect before?
Mr. Darr. Yes, sir.
Dr. Van Drew. These things considered, do you agree with
BOEM's assessment that these offshore wind projects--and this
was BOEM, it was even supporting this--would have a major and
potentially dangerous impact on maritime shipping on the east
coast?
Mr. Darr. I can't say with precision what impact it will
have, but I can say for the reasons you laid out, it must
undergo close scrutiny through a proper marine spatial planning
analysis to ensure those usages are deconflicted or we may
create something very unintended and very negative.
Dr. Van Drew. Exactly. And we have not done that. Thank
you, Chairman. I yield back.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Ms. Peltola.
Mrs. Peltola. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am really
impressed with the depth and breadth of the expertise that the
panel has, and I have enjoyed learning a lot from you all
today.
I was going to say something like, add it up, there would
be 100 years of experience, but I don't think it is that much.
I don't want to say that.
Dr. Van Drew. It doesn't make them feel good either, right?
[Laughter]
Mrs. Peltola. Yes, no. And my question is to Mr. Cordero,
and am I pronouncing that right?
Mr. Cordero. Yes.
Mrs. Peltola. OK. I think a couple other Members touched on
it earlier, but my question is really about cold ironing, also
known as shore power, and Juneau, Alaska, started doing this
with their cruise ships back in 2002, and I am just wondering
why more ports in America don't do this, and I am not really
sure if it's the short timeframe a vessel is at port or the
technology not being available?
What are some of the reasons why we don't--I think a lot of
people know that when you idle your motor, it is worse for the
environment than when you are in gear, and so, having all these
vessels just in neutral at the dock to make sure they have
power, it just doesn't make sense environmentally.
So, I was wondering if you could touch on why we haven't
made more progress in this in the last 20 years?
Mr. Cordero. Well, as you mentioned, I think the Port of
Long Beach has made a lot of progress. We shore powered our six
terminals in the early, mid-2000s. The last one was completed
in 2014.
And I think the answer to your question, Congresswoman, one
big factor is cost. I mean, it was a $200 million endeavor for
us to do that. Now, what happened to assist that, at a later
point, the State of California did mandate, by regulation,
shore powering of containerized cargo terminals, so, I think,
one, it's an example of what you do as an initiative as a port
authority in conjunction with our regulatory agencies, here
being the State of California, so, I think, again, we've been
able to develop that technology at the Port of Long Beach.
So, at this point, I think it is safe to say for any port
that wants to put that in place, that technology is there. It's
very simple, so to speak, in other words, you are not
reinventing the wheel anymore. It is just a matter of cost.
Mrs. Peltola. Would you mind following up on that question,
Mr. Darr?
Mr. Darr. I would, and I apologize, Mr. Chairman, if I'm
standing between you and perhaps ending this hearing. But I
just want to offer a couple of comments, because we deal with
this worldwide in both our cruise and our cargo business.
And first of all, shore power, unfortunately, is today
mostly a theoretical conversation because it is a relatively
very small number of ports, where Alaska has been a leader,
where it has actually been installed.
So, even if you make the investment on the shipside, which
is modest and we are prepared to do that where necessary, the
investment on the shoreside has just not been made, not been
prioritized high enough, but one of the fundamental problems
is, you have to think about where the electricity is coming
from.
Because particularly with greenhouse gas emissions, if I
plug into a grid that's being powered from coal, I am not sure
I gained anything over the power that could have been generated
on the ship.
So, the business case is actually very poor unless the
shoreside energy production infrastructure is really there.
Those are two of the major things. It's not an unwillingness on
the part of the industry, and where it's provided, you
generally see very high levels of uptake.
Mrs. Peltola. OK. And that makes sense because in Juneau
and southeast Alaska, it really is hydropower, which is very
environmentally friendly. So, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back for real.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Well, that concludes our meeting,
and we want to thank the witnesses for being here. Every one of
you has provided some very, very good input, and we will be
back to hear more, maybe at some point in time. We will see.
I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing
remain open until the time as our witnesses have provided
answers to any questions that may be submitted to them in
writing. Without objection? So ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 days for additional comments or information submitted by
the Members or witnesses to be included in today's hearing
record. Without objection? So ordered. The committee stands
adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 3:45 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
We congratulate the work of your Committee last year to pass the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). As you know, the bill
has begun to boost the national economy through significant investment
in the transportation sector.
As the IIJA moved through Congress and your Committee, we were
encouraged by the stated goal to rapidly address supply-chain
transportation solutions, which many experts believe created the core
of our nation's economic stagnation. As the Department of
Transportation developed their grant programs to administer the record
funding passed by Congress, they restated on numerous occasions the
priority of addressing supply-chain solutions.
Galveston Wharves, which is a critical Gulf Coast deepwater port at
the mouth of the Houston Ship Channel, plays a critical role in the
national supply-chain solution set. As you know, this is one of the
busiest sea lanes in the world, creating a complex set of challenges
for shippers, freight handling, and distribution logistics.
In response to the stated goals of Congress and the Administration,
we have submitted numerous grant applications for INFRA, RAISE, Port
Infrastructure Development Program grants, and more issued by the U.S.
Department of Transportation to make critical improvements to the Port
of Galveston's docking freight handling capabilities. We believe we met
every aspect of the funding objectives to relieve supply-chain
challenges, especially as an overflow deepwater port with direct access
to heavy rail lines.
To our great surprise, we were not selected over projects which had
little or nothing to do with supply-chain solutions.
We respectfully request the Committee engage in a case study on
what the real supply-chain solutions are and follow that with
appropriate federal funding to address those communities most impacted
by the cargo, which has such a large favorable impact on the national
economy.
We stand ready to assist with any such efforts by your Committee.
Sincerely,
Rodger Rees,
Port Director and CEO, Galveston Wharves.

Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
We congratulate the work of your Committee last year to pass the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). As you know, the bill
has begun to boost the national economy through significant investment
in the transportation sector.
As the IIJA moved through Congress and your Committee, our Agency
was encouraged by the stated goal to rapidly address supply-chain
transportation solutions, which many experts believe created the core
of our nation's economic stagnation. As the Department of
Transportation developed their grant programs to administer the record
funding passed by Congress, they restated on numerous occasions the
priority of addressing supply-chain solutions.
San Bernardino County Transportation Authority (SBCTA), is the lead
transportation agency for the largest county in the contiguous United
States and plays a critical role in the supply-chain distribution for
the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. As you know, these are
America's busiest seaports and create a complex set of challenges to
one of the most populated regions. Truck, rail, air, and storage
logistics driven from the ports are one of our region's biggest
challenges, not to mention the climate and air quality impacts.
In response to the stated goals of Congress and the Administration,
we submitted an SBCTA grant application for the INFRA and MEGA grants
issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation with a very significant
state match that was contingent on securing a federal grant. We believe
we met every aspect of the funding objectives to relieve supply-chain
challenges, especially as one of the Ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach's most impacted corridors.
To our great surprise, we were not selected over projects which had
little or nothing to do with supply-chain solutions. With more than
$600 million in local and state funding already committed to the
project, the decision resulted in our county losing $85 million in
additional state matching funds. We once again find ourselves wondering
when the federal transportation leaders are going to recognize the
critical role San Bernardino highways, rail tracks, airports, and
logistics warehouses play in the larger national economy driven by our
regional seaports.
We respectfully request the Committee engage in a case study on
what are the real supply-chain solutions and priorities and follow that
with appropriate federal funding to address those communities most
impacted by the cargo, which has such a large favorable impact on the
national economy.
We stand ready to assist with any such efforts by your Committee.
If you have any questions or need further input, please do not hesitate
to contact me. Thank you.
Respectfully,
Dr. Raymond W. Wolfe,
Executive Director, San Bernardino County Transportation Authority.

Questions from Hon. Daniel Webster to Charles ``Bud'' Darr, Executive
Vice President, MSC Group, on behalf of the World Shipping Council

Question 1. At the height of the pandemic, there were reports that
lack of access to equipment, such as chassis, contributed to the delay
in retrieving cargo and resulting congestion at the ports. How does an
equipment shortage impact the assessment of detention and demurrage
charges against a shipper who is delinquent in retrieving their cargo?
Answer. The pandemic-caused congestion resulted in logjams across
the entire supply chain, which at certain times made it challenging to
access equipment such as chassis.
The purpose of detention and demurrage fees is to incentivize the
rapid retrieval of cargo and return of equipment to promote freight
fluidity. The Federal Maritime Commission's Interpretive Rule on
Demurrage and Detention Under the Shipping Act, 85 Fed. Reg. 29638,
provides guidance on when it is reasonable to assess detention and
demurrage charges by using a non-exclusive use of factors set forth in
its rule.
The FMC's assessment is case and fact specific, but it states that
importers should not be penalized by demurrage and detention practices
when circumstances are such that they cannot retrieve containers from
marine terminals, because under those circumstances, the charges do not
serve their incentivizing function.
If a shortage of equipment impacted the ability of a shipper to
retrieve its cargo, resulting in the issuance of detention and
demurrage charges, the Interpretive Rule's factors would be applied to
the specific facts of that case, to determine whether the issuance of
the charges in that case was reasonable under the circumstances.
Preferably, these issues are raised and resolved via the relevant ocean
carrier's established processes, such as those we have implemented at
MSC.
Under an appropriate ``totality of the circumstances''
reasonableness analysis, one of the factors for consideration is the
role that a shipper (cargo owner) has played in causing a shortage of
equipment. During the pandemic, the problem of containers being left on
marine terminals by cargo owners for long periods of time became so
serious that various port authorities and marine terminal operators
either threatened or imposed ``long dwell'' charges against containers
stored on the port for excessive periods of time. One reaction by cargo
owners was to remove the containers from the port, but then to store
the full containers on chassis without unloading the containers and
returning the containers and chassis. This resulted in both container
and chassis shortages. This practice was driven by the fact that cargo
owners' warehouses and distribution centers could not handle the volume
of cargo that importers had contracted to have transported to the
United States. This example illustrates why equipment ``shortages'' are
not typically a matter of there not physically being enough equipment
units, but rather shortages are driven by whether all players in the
supply chain keep that equipment moving so that it can be used for the
next shipment. In that context, an equipment shortage can be caused as
easily by a shipper as by an ocean carrier, a trucker, or any other
actor in the supply chain.

Question 2. A leading challenge during the ocean freight crisis was
that ocean carriers were shipping empty containers back to Asia or
other import-origin locations, which resulted in American exports being
stranded at our docks. Can you explain your views on why that occurred,
and what steps are being taken to assure that American exporters have
access to the containers and equipment they need to send their product
to customers abroad?
Answer. Ocean carriers operate services or routes, much like buses,
that move on specific schedules to provide consumers reliable and
frequent service. There is no separate import system or export system--
liner shipping routes are continuous loops--think of 8 ships
continuously traveling along the same loop between a U.S. port and
Singapore. If each ship carries about 8,000 containers, this single
route or service is transporting 64,000 containers of cargo at any
point in time.
Due to the current U.S. trade imbalance, containerized imports to
the U.S. generally outnumber containerized exports by a ratio of 2 to
1--during COVID-19 this ratio surged due to altered consumer spending
patterns. To keep the supply chain moving and provide sufficient
equipment to meet both import and export demand, two-thirds of all
containers leaving U.S. ports needed to be empty, on average. If those
empty containers are not removed from U.S. ports, the resulting port
congestion would slow the ocean transportation system for both
importers and exporters. The challenge for both U.S. importers and
exporters during the pandemic was getting the right equipment to the
right place at the right time. Keeping empty containers moving
throughout the global network was critical to maintaining service for
both importers and exporters.
Ocean carriers deployed every available ship and container to
provide sufficient capacity in response to this demand. However, the
U.S. landside logistics system was not able to efficiently process the
historic surge of import cargo, resulting in bottlenecks throughout the
supply chain. If MSC had 7,000 ships in its network rather than 700, it
would not have alleviated any congestion because this would have just
resulted in that many more additional ships trying to fit into an
already over-burdened shoreside infrastructure.
At the height of the congestion, in November 2021, there were more
than 100 container vessels with hundreds of thousands of containers
aboard stranded off the ports of Southern California waiting for up to
4 weeks to come in and offload their cargo. Long vessel backups also
occurred at East coast ports such as Savannah and Gulf ports such as
Houston. It is important here to note that at no time did we have a
container supply problem, or a shortage of container vessel capacity,
we had a U.S. landside container movement problem.
Notwithstanding the tremendous COVID-caused strain on the supply
chain, it was met with a momentous and extraordinary response with the
international ocean and U.S. intermodal supply chain moving more cargo
than at any time in history.
While there were allegations that exporters of agricultural
products were disproportionately affected by the congestion or ocean
carriers' operational requirement to balance import and export
equipment demands to keep the supply chain fluid, U.S. government data
does not support such claims; rather, despite the challenges in the
supply chain, U.S. agricultural exports moved at record levels.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported in FY 2022 U.S.
agriculture exports hit a record $196.4 billion--which was a 14%
percent increase from the previous FY 2021 record of $172.2 billion
(which was a 23% increase from 2020). Source: U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Service.
These record levels of both imports and U.S. agriculture exports
during almost 3 years of a global pandemic are testament to ocean
carriers working closely with their customers, and more broadly, all
members of the supply chain working to meet the demands of both
importers and exporters.
Congress has since passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, which
contains $17 billion dollars of directed funding to expand the capacity
and resiliency of U.S. ports, and even billions more for landside
infrastructure improvement. Ocean carriers believe this type of
historic investment is the best way to ensure that when faced with
future challenges such as a global pandemic, the U.S. supply chain can
keep all goods--both imports and exports--efficiently moving to support
the demands of consumers and businesses.

Question 3. When ocean carriers delay vessel departures, leave
early, or miss a port visit entirely, American exporters can face
significant economic harm--which can mean lost sales, lost product
value due to diminishing shelf-life, and product perishability. While
trade flows are normalizing, should they pick up again, how can
American exporters be confident that they can get their cargo shipped
in a timely and reliable manner?
Answer. Per our response to question 2, ship movements are dictated
by the ability of shoreside infrastructure to handle the cargo
transported by ships. If ships are delayed in entering ports and
conducting cargo operations because of slow-downs driven by land-side
infrastructure failures, then the entire system suffers--import and
export. Vessel schedule reliability problems are typically a symptom,
not the cause, of land-side failures. The best way to ensure the U.S.
landside supply chain has sufficient capacity to handle crisis-driven
cargo surges, such as the unprecedented import demand caused by
homebound consumers in COVID-19, and prevent against future congestion,
is to invest in the capacity and resiliency of U.S. ports and landside
infrastructure, as well as to enhance operational practices ashore to
ensure maximum fluidity and resiliency.
Now that Congress has passed the bipartisan infrastructure bill
which contains historic levels of funding for investments in U.S. ports
and landside infrastructure, Congress must ensure this money is used to
make the needed investments.
The other critical tool to keep cargo moving expeditiously through
the ports is to ensure that regulations on detention and demurrage
retain the ability for carriers and marine terminal operators to
provide economic incentives for cargo interests to timely pick-up
loaded containers and timely return empty containers so that other
customers may use that equipment.
As highlighted in my written testimony, the currently proposed
Federal Maritime Commission rule on detention and demurrage fails to
provide the proper regulatory structure to insure fair, reasonable, and
effective incentives for cargo movement. We need Congress's assistance
to ensure the Commission's proposal is corrected before a final rule is
issued.

Question 4. West Coast ports, including Long Beach, have seen a
significant drop-off in cargo year over year. While some of that
decline can be attributed to a normalization in cargo volumes, to what
degree is the uncertainty with labor negotiations at West Coast Ports
impacting decisions to divert cargo to the Gulf and East Coast?
Answer. The World Shipping Council does not oversee labor
negotiations with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union--the
ILWU negotiations are handled by the Pacific Maritime Association, and
PMA is likely in the best position to answer whether labor uncertainty
is a causal factor for the recent cargo volume shift to East and Gulf
Coast ports.
What we can say is that ocean carriers deliver the cargo to where
its customers--shippers--direct the cargo to be delivered. Recent
statistics document a cargo shift from U.S. West Coast ports to East
and Gulf Coast ports. It is unclear whether this shift is permanent, or
temporary. The cargo shift may be related to several factors beyond
ongoing West Coast ILWU labor negotiations, including a recently
expanded Panama Canal which can now support transits by larger vessels,
investment in Gulf and East Coast ports that has deepened their harbors
and expanded their cargo handling capabilities, as well as geographic
reasons such as Gulf and East Coast ports proximity to major U.S.
consumer markets and newly built manufacturing hubs in the southern
United States.

Questions from Hon. Daniel Webster to Matthew Leech, President and
Chief Executive Officer, Ports America, on behalf of the National
Association of Waterfront Employers

Question 1. Recent news reports have discussed the potential threat
that Chinese manufactured cranes pose to national security, serving as
intelligence gathering devices capable of tracking the movement of
goods at our ports. What is being done to ensure the security of crane
equipment at marine terminals?
Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2. As greater amounts of cargo come into our ports, many
port and terminal operators are working to optimize and improve
operations, including through use of technology and automated systems
that have the potential to improve container throughput. At the same
time, longshore unions have resisted a transition to these new
technologies.
Question 2.a. What role does technology play in improving and
optimizing the capacity to move cargo through our ports?
Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2.b. Do policies or labor agreements that prevent the
adoption of more efficient processes at ports contribute to supply
chain bottlenecks?
Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2.c. In your opinion, should Congress consider removing
limitations on Federal funding for ports that impede the adoption of
automated technology?
Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 3. You assert that ocean carriers are the marine terminal
operators' only customers and, in turn, the cargo owners are solely the
customers of the ocean carriers. In the Federal Maritime Commission's
(FMC) proposed rule on detention and demurrage, the Commission
suggested that contracts exist between terminal operators and cargo
owners. Why is this contractual concept proposed by the FMC a problem
for marine terminal operators?
Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.

Questions from Hon. Daniel Webster to Mario Cordero, Executive
Director, Port of Long Beach

Question 1. At a Senate hearing last fall, Department of Homeland
Security Secretary Mayorkas testified that the most significant threat
to United States ports are cyberattacks. As technology at ports is
becoming increasingly complex, cyber criminals and hostile nation
states are using cyberattacks to target supply chains and cause
disruptions and safety issues. I understand that your neighbor, the
Port of Los Angeles, faces up to 40 million cyberattacks per month.
Other ports have seen disruptions to their operations and successful
ransomware attacks.
Question 1.a. Please discuss the threats that cyberattacks pose to
port operations.
Answer. The Port of Long Beach (Port) continues to use holistic and
layered defense methods to block ever-increasing cyber-attack attempts,
which have quadrupled over the past few years. The continually shifting
attack techniques pose an ever-changing threat to all Port
stakeholders. Port operations continue to be targeted based on critical
supply chain infrastructures that are essential for the smooth movement
of goods through Port terminals.
The blocked cyber-attacks come in a variety of methods including:

Attempts to access data using phishing attacks (fake
emails posing as a trusted source to deceive a person into clicking on
malware or provide their passwords to business-critical systems);

Opportunistic use of computer networks to gain access to
data; and,

Other sophisticated hacking techniques.

If successful, the above methods could result in operational
outages, ransomware, malware, a virus or other similar threats. The
Port's holistic layered defense includes strengthening the potentially
weak human link through a metrics driven cybersecurity awareness
training program since trained users are 40% less likely to click on an
email phishing link. The program is regularly run multiple times a year
with a 100% staff completion rate. This is in line with best practices
as 84% of leading organizations in recent studies cite cybersecurity
awareness training as a key building block of cyber resilience.
The current geo-political landscape has resulted in sharp increases
of cyber-attack attempts aimed at the Port from nation-state sponsored
actors, organized crime syndicates and splinter groups of ``lone wolf''
hackers.

Question 1.b. What support is the Federal Government providing to
ports to address these security threats?
Answer. Currently, the primary source of support from the Federal
Government to Ports is the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Port
Security Grant Program (PSGP). Although authorized at $400 million,
appropriation for this funding source has remained stagnant at $100
million and it has multiple priorities, only one of which is
cybersecurity. The Port has been awarded multiple cybersecurity related
grants from PSGP and have utilized the funding to perform penetration
tests, remediate vulnerabilities, install cyber protection mechanisms
that are needed to address the current threat landscape, and develop
plans for cloud-based resiliency for critical systems. Since 2013, the
Port has received $4.7 million in federal funding that was geared
toward cybersecurity enhancements in hardware, software, and
resiliency. With cybersecurity risk growing and bad actors becoming
ever more sophisticated, we urge Congress to increase funding for PSGP
grants.
Additionally, the State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program
(SLCGP) that was released in 2022 is a funding source that the Port
hopes to leverage. However, the priorities for grant allocation from
that program are currently being set at the state level and it is
unsure at this time if ports will be given appropriate consideration.

Question 2. Compared to major ports in Europe and Asia that operate
24/7, United States ports tend to operate for only a fraction of the
day. In your testimony, you discussed your support for implementing 24/
7 port operations, which would increase cargo throughput and
efficiency. Can you describe some of the barriers to implementing 24/7
operations, and what can be done to overcome them?
Answer. The biggest challenge for implementing 24/7 operations at
the Port is to strike the balance between continuous port operations,
cargo demand and capacity challenges outside of the ports. Our terminal
operators have demonstrated that they are capable and willing to
deliver cargo utilizing three shifts of the work day. However, as the
later part of 2022 has demonstrated, congestion in the inland rail
ramps and warehouses that were no longer capable of accepting more
freights have rendered 24/7 port operations ineffective. The ports and
the terminals are ready to operate 24/7, but the supply chain outside
of the ports have to keep up with the pace.

Question 3. As greater amounts of cargo come into our ports, many
port and terminal operators are working to optimize and improve
operations, including using technology and automated systems that have
the potential to improve container throughput. At the same time,
longshore unions have resisted a transition to these new technologies.
Given your experience with the introduction of automated
technologies at the Port of Long Beach, can you describe the role
technology plays in improving and optimizing the capacity to move cargo
through our ports?
Answer. Technology can improve supply chain efficiency in two main
areas: operations and information. Certain technologies can help better
plan and execute ship-side and yard operations as well as optimizing
cargo delivery utilizing the skilled labor in the terminals. The other
improvement is by providing cargo visibility throughout the supply
chain utilizing data sources from various stakeholders such as
terminals, ocean carriers and railroads.
In December 2021, recognizing the need for a technology solution
that would enable terminal operators, ocean carriers and shippers to
efficiently coordinate the movement of goods through the Port, the Port
developed the Supply Chain Information Highway. The project is a
digital solution that provides the supply chain with data that can be
integrated into their own systems, enabling them to track cargo from
origin to destination and make better operational decisions. The Port
of Oakland, Port of Miami, Port of South Carolina, Utah Inland Port
Authority, and the Northwest Seaport Alliance, a marine cargo operating
partnership of the ports of Seattle and Tacoma, are collaborating with
the Port of Long Beach on the Supply Chain Information Highway. The
goal is to offer access to data that will result in increased delivery
visibility for authorized supply chain partners nationwide.

Question 4. West Coast ports, including Long Beach, have seen a
significant drop-off in cargo year over year. While some of that
decline can be attributed to a normalization in cargo volumes, to what
degree is the uncertainty with labor negotiations at West Coast ports
driving cargo to the Gulf and East Coast?
Answer. During our meetings with customers in recent months, we
heard their concerns about the ILWU/PMA labor negotiations. Many of
these customers have indeed diverted cargo to the East Coast and Gulf
ports. However, there is a large consumption base served by the West
Coast ports, especially in Southern California. Therefore, the same
customers also indicated that they would re-start using West Coast
ports once the negotiations have been completed. We are confident that
the volume will return to the West Coast once the issues have been
resolved.
An imbalance of investments in East Coast and Gulf ports compared
to West Coast ports has also led to diminished cargo volumes at the San
Pedro Bay Ports (SPBP) Complex. Prior to the pandemic, the SPBP faced
loss of market share due to infrastructure investments elsewhere and
the lack of investments here. From 2010 to 2020, federal funding was
invested heavily in smaller ports on the East Coast and in the Gulf--
$11 for every $1 spent on the West Coast. In addition, the SPBP
contributes $380 million annually to the federal Harbor Maintenance
Trust Fund, but receives less than 1.5% in federal investments back.
Canada also out-invested the U.S. in freight rail projects causing 22%
of rail cargo business to shift from West Coast ports to Canadian
ports. The pandemic exposed how neglect in investments in port
infrastructure, shared data systems and the workforce caused
unprecedented backlogs throughout the entire goods movement industry.

Question from Hon. Salud O. Carbajal to Mario Cordero, Executive
Director, Port of Long Beach

Question 1. Mr. Cordero, I am greatly concerned by the impact of
emissions and poor air quality on the oftentimes disadvantaged
communities that live around ports.
Can you provide some information, including some of the
environmental justice work, that the Port of Long Beach has done and
how smaller ports can replicate that?
Answer. I appreciate your question regarding steps that the Port of
Long Beach (Port) has taken to improve air quality for our port-
adjacent communities and I am pleased to provide a written response
detailing the environmental justice work that has been undertaken by
the Port which may be replicated at smaller ports across the nation.
As the nation's second busiest seaport and a vital economic engine
for the City of Long Beach and the region, the Port recognizes that
economic vitality comes at a cost to the local community, which bears
the brunt of the environmental and public health impacts of port
development and operation. Communities around the Port--including
Wilmington, Carson, and West Long Beach--have a higher percentage of
minority and low-income populations compared to the state. In general,
these communities have worse public health factors and more social and
economic disadvantages compared to the broader population.
The Port has a responsibility to ensure that as the Port's business
thrives, so do the lives of the surrounding communities. We have
undertaken a comprehensive approach to being an environmental leader
and giving back to the community through environmental stewardship,
establishing a Community Grants Program and adopting the Green Port
Policy. Many of the lessons learned for these actions could be
replicated on a smaller scale.
Environmental Stewardship. Over the last two decades, the Port has
been a leader in environmental stewardship and has been committed to
seaport sustainability and addressing environmental and health impacts
through such groundbreaking efforts as the Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP)
and Water Resources Action Plan. Since 2005, port-related emissions of
NOx and SOx have dropped by 62% and 97% respectively, according to the
Port's most recent emissions inventory, and port-related DPM has
plunged 90%. The area around the San Pedro Bay Port Complex has seen a
greater decline in air-related cancer risk than Southern California as
a whole.
According to the South Coast Air Quality Management District's
MATES-V Study, between 2012-2019, cancer risk near the Port of Long
Beach and Port of Los Angeles dropped 57% compared to a 53% reduction
for the rest of the region. In April 2021, USEPA recognized CAAP as
``an excellent example of what can happen when port operators work with
neighboring communities to develop and implement a robust plan, leading
to positive impacts on air quality and emissions.''
Community Grants Program. The Port established the Community Grants
Program (CGP) for community-based mitigation projects for three
specific programs that alleviate impacts from port-related activities:
Community Health; Facility Improvements; and Community Infrastructure.
In March 2017, the Board of Harbor Commissioners allocated an initial
$46.4 million for the implementation of CGP to be expended over 12-15
years. Overall, the Port has set aside more than $65 million for this
program, making it the largest voluntary port mitigation initiative in
the country. Environmental justice is also a critical component in the
environmental review process for all Harbor Development Permit
applications. Public involvement ensures that the community has a role
by providing input on potential environmental and health impacts.
Green Port Policy. Fully committed to improving the environment, in
2005 the Port adopted the Green Port Policy, which established a
framework for environmentally friendly port operations. An emphasis is
placed on community outreach programs that pursue engagement to enhance
understanding of Port operations and encourage greater participation in
decision-making. The Port engages regularly with neighborhood
associations, community organizations, and environmental justice groups
to provide outreach and updates on the Port's development projects. The
Port also fosters opportunities for students to learn about careers in
the trade and supply chain sectors through partnerships with the Long
Beach Unified School District, Long Beach City College and California
State University Long Beach. The Port's Academy of Global Logistics at
Cabrillo High School is a 4-year program that combines an academic
curriculum with industry-relevant training to support career
development. In addition, the Port provides community sponsorships
while expanding its reach into the local community. The hundreds of
local nonprofit recipient groups each year represent a cross-section of
the region.
