II. BACKGROUND

Amtrak operates a National passenger rail system, which
includes the Northeast Corridor (NEC), long-distance routes,
and state-supported routes.\1\ Amtrak generally runs more than
300 trains per day, serves more than 500 stations located in 46
states and Washington, D.C., and operates a network that
stretches more than 22,000 miles across the country.\2\ Of all
Amtrak passenger trips in 2023, approximately 42 percent were
taken on the NEC; 44 percent on state-supported routes; and 14
percent on long-distance routes.\3\ In Fiscal Year (FY) 2023,
Amtrak carried 28,579,216 riders, which was a 25 percent
increase from 22,930,499 riders in FY 2022, (roughly 88 percent
of FY 2019's total of 32,519,241 customers) and brought in a
total annual revenue of $3.4 billion.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On November 15, 2021, President Biden signed the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (P.L. 117-58).
The bill authorizes and appropriates over five years an
unprecedented $102 billion for the Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA) and at least another $30 billion in
discretionary multimodal grants for which Amtrak and other
intercity passenger rail projects are eligible.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ 49 U.S.C. Sec.  6701 (noting the National Infrastructure
Project Assistance, authorized at $5 billion and appropriated at $10
billion over five years); see also 49 U.S.C. Sec.  6702 (noting the
Local and Regional Project Assistance, authorized at $7.5 billion and
appropriated at $7.5 billion over five years); see also 23 U.S.C. Sec.
149; see also 49 U.S.C. Sec.  224, et seq.; see also 23 U.S.C. Sec.
601, et seq. (describing two Federal loan programs that include this
eligibility, Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing and
Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. FEDERAL RAILROAD FUNDING

IIJA authorizes more than three times the authorized
amounts subject to appropriation over the same period in the
Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) (P.L.
114-94). Additionally, IIJA appropriated more than $66 billion
in supplemental funding for FRA programs, including $22 billion
in direct funding for Amtrak's capital programs, not operating
expenses.\6\ Taken together, the authorizations and
supplemental appropriations for FRA programs under IIJA exceed
$100 billion.\7\ IIJA authorizations and supplemental
appropriations are outlined below along with the amounts
authorized and appropriated during the years of the FAST Act.
Under the law, the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and National
Network grant amounts are directed to Amtrak, while the four
competitive grant programs are administered by the United
States Department of Transportation (DOT) and have multiple
eligible applicants.\8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally, Congress provided more than $3.7 billion in
Northeast Corridor and National Network Grants to Amtrak during
the COVID-19 pandemic to offset revenue losses from decreased
ridership and to maintain employment levels.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\10\ See CARES Act, Pub. L. No. 116-136, 134 Stat. 281;
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. No. 116-260, 134 Stat.
1182; American Rescue Plan Act, Pub. L. No. 117-2, 135 Stat. 4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Passenger rail lines worldwide rarely generate an operating
profit.\11\ Recently, FY 2019 was one of the closest years that
Amtrak came to making an operating profit, when it registered a
net loss of $881 million and a net operating loss, after
adjustments, of $29 million for the year.\12\ Due to the COVID-
19 pandemic, Amtrak's FY 2020 revenues fell by 60 percent and
ridership plummeted.\13\ Amtrak's FY 2021 net loss was over $2
billion, which recovered somewhat in FY 2022, with a net loss
of $1.825 billion,\14\ and $1.751 billion in FY 2023.\15\
According to Amtrak's Five-Year Plan for FY 2024-2029 Amtrak is
projecting a cost recovery goal of 86 percent in FY 2024, with
projected operating losses of roughly $625.3 million, to a cost
recovery goal of 93 percent in FY 2029, with projected
operating losses of roughly $356.6 million.\16\

IV. AMTRAK RIDERSHIP

In pre-pandemic FY 2019, Amtrak set a record of 32.5
million trips taken on its system.\17\ FY 2019 marked the
eighth straight year Amtrak ridership surpassed 30 million
trips.\18\ In FY 2020, following the onset of the pandemic,
ridership plummeted to roughly 16.8 million people.\19\ April
2020 saw ridership fall to nearly 95 percent of its total one
year prior.\20\ Demand bottomed out in FY 2021 when Amtrak
carried 12.2 million riders, representing a drop of 62.6
percent in ridership.\21\ Following a reduction in ridership
due to the pandemic from FY 2020 through FY 2022, in FY 2023,
ridership increased to 28.6 million trips as the pandemic
ended, 88 percent of pre-pandemic levels.\22\ Through April
2024, ridership is 3.1 million higher versus the same time
frame in FY 2023.\23\

V. ILLUSTRATIVE CORRIDOR DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS

FRA CORRIDOR IDENTIFICATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

Established by IIJA, the FRA's Corridor ID program will
guide intercity passenger rail planning and development.\24\ It
is intended to become the primary means for directing Federal
investment and assistance for new and improved intercity
passenger rail routes.\25\ The Corridor ID program is meant to
support long-term development of intercity passenger rail and
will create a capital project pipeline ready for Federal (and
other) funding.\26\ On December 8, 2023, FRA announced 69
corridor selections in 44 states.\27\

AMTRAK AND INTERCITY PASSENGER RAIL OVERSIGHT: PROMOTING PERFORMANCE,
SAFETY, AND ACCOUNTABILITY

----------

WEDNESDAY, JUNE 12, 2024

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous
Materials,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 2:01 p.m., in
room 2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Troy E. Nehls
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Nehls. The Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and
Hazardous Materials will come to order.
I ask unanimous consent that the chairman be authorized to
declare a recess at any time during today's hearing. Without
objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that Members not on the
subcommittee be permitted to sit with the subcommittee at
today's hearing and ask questions. Without objection, so
ordered.
As a reminder, if Members wish to insert a document into
the record, please also email it to
[email protected]
.
I now recognize myself for the purposes of an opening
statement for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TROY E. NEHLS OF TEXAS, CHAIRMAN,
SUBCOMMITTEE ON RAILROADS, PIPELINES, AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Mr. Nehls. Today's hearing will survey the current and
future operations of Amtrak. Amtrak is federally chartered,
owned by the Federal Government, and governed by a Board of
Directors appointed by the President and subject to Senate
confirmation.
As a generous recipient of taxpayers dollars to operate its
system, Amtrak should focus on maintaining and improving its
current services to increase revenue and achieve profitability.
Instead, Amtrak seems content to lose roughly $1 billion per
year by its own predictions and, flush with historic funding
from the IIJA, is choosing to pursue costly and highly
questionable acquisitions and route expansions that may not
serve the best interests of the American commuter.
Amtrak ridership collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ridership has since rebounded as of March of 2024, yet much
remains to be done to improve service and attract riders.
Today's hearing will provide an opportunity to continue this
subcommittee's examination of the challenges that are in the
way of potential improvements.
For instance, in 2016, Amtrak received almost $2.5 billion
in Federal loans to procure new Acela trainsets. However, as of
today, no trainsets have been entered into service. This is
primarily because Amtrak approved the manufacture of new
trainsets before the completion of required safety modeling
that ensures the trains are safe to run on the Northeast
Corridor track. As such, these trainsets are 3 years behind
schedule and tens of millions of dollars over budget.
We also remain concerned about the lack of improvements in
transparency and accountability at Amtrak following the record
levels of funding it has received in recent years. The Amtrak
Board of Directors does not make its meetings open to the
public as other federally chartered entities do, and the Board
has approved substantial performance bonus payments to Amtrak
executives, despite significant financial losses. Doesn't seem
right.
As the committee of jurisdiction over Amtrak, we will
continue to monitor these critical issues and conduct oversight
to assure that taxpayer funding is used in the most effective
manner to improve service and get Amtrak back on the road to
profitability.
Thank you to our witnesses for joining us today, and I do,
I do look forward to our discussion.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON OF FLORIDA,
RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON RAILROADS, PIPELINES, AND
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you, Chairman Nehls, and thank
you to our witnesses today. Welcome to all of you.
Amtrak is our Nation's intercity passenger rail service,
and as a Floridian, I am proud of both Amtrak's routes and
Brightline services, which now connect Miami and Orlando.
Amtrak and Brightline operate on tracks that my great-
grandfather built when he first immigrated to this country from
The Bahamas. Amtrak allowed me to ride my first overnight train
to New York City as a little girl. Two Amtrak trains per day
run through my district, and we have a maintenance facility in
nearby Hialeah.
Brightline and Amtrak are central services in our
community, but unfortunately, we have endured too many grade
crossing deaths. Two weeks ago, a vehicle was struck on the
rail in Opa-locka in the heart of my district. Luckily, no one
was hurt this time. But this is just one of the countless
incidents of railcar collision.
While I understand some of these incidents are outside
Brightline's and Amtrak's control, at a certain point, with so
many incidents, we must ask, at what point does it become our
joint responsibility to address this crisis? When do we do
that?
For the 3 years before the Brightline launch, I discussed
safety along the railroad line, because safety remains my top
priority for the work on this subcommittee. Alongside safety,
expanding rail to all Americans and connecting the diverse
parts of America through rail remains a priority for me.
As one of the five original cosponsors of the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, I am proud that this law is ushering in an
era of unprecedented investments in rail. We are seeing this
funding being channeled into substantial safety improvements to
the Brightline route in Dania Beach, Wilton Manors, Fort
Lauderdale, Hallandale Beach, Hollywood, Pompano Beach, and
West Palm Beach.
In our effort to expand rail, the Corridor ID Program
identified 69 corridors in 44 States guiding passenger rail
expansion across the country. I am glad to see that two of
those corridors are in my home State of Florida, and more
specifically, in my community: the Miami-Orlando-Tampa corridor
and the Jacksonville-Orlando-Miami corridor.
Late last year, the Federal Railroad Administration awarded
$8.2 billion across 10 projects in 9 States to improve and
expand passenger rail service. This includes extending and
improving the Piedmont Corridor in North Carolina, which will
improve connections with the busy Northeast Corridor.
Ms. White, I am sure you will be able to tell us more about
just how your State has been able to make this historic
investment in passenger rail.
Beyond the benefits to rail passengers, the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law investments are revolutionizing the railway
supply chain. Siemens is investing in a new North Carolina
facility that will build new Amtrak trainsets and provide
maintenance for railcars and locomotives for years to come.
This facility will add 500 jobs and over $1.6 billion to the
local economy, all thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
Through recent rail investments, we also have been able to
better support our future rail workers. Last September, the
Federal Railroad Administration awarded the University of South
Florida a $17 million grant to work with universities
nationwide to boost the railroad workforce.
These are just some of the many improvements we have
recently made in the rail space. And I look forward to hearing
from our witnesses today about the impact the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law has made on passenger rail and what they
would like to see in the next infrastructure law. All aboard.
Mr. Chair, with that, I yield back.
[Ms. Wilson of Florida's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Frederica S. Wilson, a Representative in
Congress from the State of Florida, and Ranking Member, Subcommittee on
Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials
Thank you, Chairman Nehls, and thank you to our witnesses today.
Amtrak is our nation's intercity passenger rail service, but as a
Floridian, I'm proud to note that Brightline service now connects Miami
and Orlando, and I'm glad to see that Florida has Amtrak and Brightline
operating side by side. Amtrak and Brightline operate on tracks that my
great-grandfather built when he first immigrated to this country,
allowing me to ride my first overnight train to New York City as a
girl. Two Amtrak trains per day run through my district, and we have a
maintenance facility in nearby Hialeah.
Brightline and Amtrak are good services in our community, but,
unfortunately, we have endured too many grade crossing deaths. Two
weeks ago, a vehicle was struck on the rail right of way in Opa-locka
in my district. Luckily, no one was hurt this time.
For the three years before the Brightline launch, I discussed
safety along the railroad line. Safety remains my top priority for the
work on this Subcommittee.
The unprecedented investments of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
are continuing safety improvements to the Brightline route in Dania
Beach, Wilton Manors, Ft. Lauderdale, Hallandale Beach, Hollywood,
Pompano Beach and West Palm Beach.

Piedmont Corridor in North Carolina, which will improve connections
with the busy Northeast Corridor. Ms. White will be able to tell us
more about how her state has been able to make this historic investment
in passenger rail.
And we are also able to better support our future rail workers.
Last September, the FRA awarded the University of South Florida a $17
million grant to work with universities across the country to boost the
railroad workforce.
The Corridor ID program identified 69 corridors in 44 states
including the District of Columbia that will guide the expansion of
passenger rail across the country. Two of the selected corridors are in
my home state of Florida, the Miami-Orlando-Tampa corridor and the
Jacksonville-Orlando-Miami Corridor.
Beyond the benefits to rail passengers, the investments in the BIL
are revolutionizing the railway supply chain. Siemens is investing in a
new North Carolina facility that will build new Amtrak trainsets and
provide maintenance for rail cars and locomotives for years to come.
This facility will add 500 jobs and over $1.6 billion to the local

I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about the impact
the BIL has made on passenger rail and what they would like to see in
the next infrastructure law, and I yield back my time.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Ms. Wilson. And I appreciate your
comments on rail crossings, grade crossings, and the dangers
that we see across our country probably on a weekly basis here.
And I think we as a committee should address those. I agree
with you wholeheartedly.
I now recognize the ranking member of the full committee,
Mr. Larsen, for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair, and thank you,
Ranking Member Wilson, for holding today's hearing on improving
Amtrak and intercity passenger rail across the country.
Before I begin, I want to welcome Representative Chris
Deluzio as a member of this subcommittee, as well as a member
of the Subcommittee on Aviation. Representative Deluzio joins
this committee with a record of fighting to strengthen
transportation safety and support workers. I look forward to
your partnership on rail safety and other initiatives to make
America's infrastructure cleaner, greener, safer, and more
accessible.
Turning to today's hearing, the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law was a monumental achievement that supercharged our Nation's
investment in rail with more than $100 billion in funding. The
BIL provided bold, long-term investments in transportation
systems and infrastructure. These investments are creating jobs
and benefiting the economy.
For intercity passenger rail, the BIL guaranteed multiyear
funding for capital investments and development. It made
possible, for the first time ever, dedicated, reliable Federal
funding disbursed over 5 years to improve and expand intercity
passenger rail.
Since our hearing last year, the FRA has announced $26.6
billion in BIL grants for 237 projects. This includes 69
corridors in 44 States, including the District of Columbia,
that were all recipients of Corridor ID grants.
In my State of Washington, the Washington State Department
of Transportation received grants for two corridors: the
Cascadia Ultra High-Speed Ground Transportation project that
will provide a new alignment for high-speed rail service
between Vancouver, Canada, and Portland, Oregon, via Seattle,
and the current State-supported Amtrak Cascades route that
serves Bellingham, Mount Vernon, Stanwood, Everett, and Edmonds
in my district.
The BIL is also an investment in our workforce. The funding
is being used to grow a well-trained, diverse workforce to
build, operate, and maintain a national intercity passenger
rail network. Amtrak has hired an additional 8,500 people in
the last 2 years, and the BIL is funding university-led,
Amtrak-led, and union-led workforce development initiatives.
Great results are already here as we hit the halfway mark
of the BIL, and more is still to come from additional rail
funding to be announced.
Now, while a final appropriations bill for fiscal year 2024
did not include all the rail funding authorized in BIL, it did
demonstrate bipartisan support for these investments. I look
forward to hearing today from witnesses about the impact of
budget certainty and how this will ultimately improve service
for rail passengers.
As we did in fighting for rail funding in the BIL, this
committee is dedicated to helping communities get regular and
reliable passenger rail service. Of the $100 billion provided
for rail in the BIL, $66 billion was provided in the form of
advanced appropriations. The remaining $34 billion is subject
to appropriations and therefore not guaranteed.
So, I will continue to push for Congress to fully fund its
intercity passenger rail commitments to create jobs, grow
regional economies, reduce congestion and carbon emissions, and
build a cleaner, greener, safer, and more accessible
transportation network.
This transformational investment in the BIL is a great
start, but Congress needs to build on this by securing regular,
reliable funding for intercity passenger rail.
Thanks to the BIL, for the first time since the founding of
Amtrak over 50 years ago, States and cities have the certainty
of knowing that funding for passenger rail projects will be
there. Highways, transit, airports, and harbors all have
funding certainty to some extent, enabling long-term major
capital projects in these modes without fluctuations due to the
annual appropriations process.
It is time the intercity passenger rail had the same
certainty.
The demand exists. Last year, FRA received over $18 billion
in applications for $8.9 billion in available funds, and the
Corridor ID Program received over 90 applications from
communities that want to add or improve intercity passenger
rail connections.
So, today, we are going to hear from witnesses who are
turning these historic investments into tangible improvements.
I want to thank each of the witnesses for joining our committee
today to provide their vision and recommendations for the
future of passenger rail.
And with that, I yield back.

TESTIMONY OF STEPHEN GARDNER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NATIONAL
RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION (AMTRAK); ANTHONY COSCIA, CHAIR
OF THE BOARD, NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION (AMTRAK);
AND JULIE A. WHITE, DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR MULTIMODAL
TRANSPORTATION, NORTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

TESTIMONY OF STEPHEN GARDNER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NATIONAL
RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION (AMTRAK)

Mr. Gardner. Good afternoon, Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member
Wilson, Ranking Member Larsen, and members of the subcommittee.
I am Stephen Gardner, Amtrak CEO, and thank you for inviting me
today. It is my pleasure to share this table with our Chairman,
Tony Coscia, and our great partner, Deputy Secretary White of
North Carolina.
Amtrak has accomplished a great deal during fiscal year
2024. Our ridership and revenue are up, over 20 and 10 percent,
respectively, and May was our best revenue month ever in the
history of the company. We are on track to set a new record
ridership this year and will further reduce our operating
losses. We have expanded service with our State partners, and
on the Northeast Corridor, we have added frequencies to meet
demand.
Thanks to the funding from the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act, construction is now underway, or starting soon,
on truly massive projects that we have been discussing for
decades, like the Hudson and Frederick Douglass Tunnel
projects, the Portal North, Connecticut River, and Susquehanna
River bridges, and redevelopment of our stations in Chicago and
Philadelphia.
We are also acquiring new equipment that will transform the
travel experience. Our new Acela trains are testing now and
could enter service around the end of this year. Our new Amtrak
Airo for regional service to the Northeast and State-supported
routes are arriving in 2026, and we are out to bid right now
for a new fleet of long-distance trains.
To make all this happen, Amtrak is undergoing a dramatic
transformation. We are not the company we were a few years ago.
We have rebuilt and expanded our workforce with some of the
best in the business. We have enhanced safety and security,
thanks to technologies like Positive Train Control and the hard
work of the Amtrak Police Department and our cybersecurity
team. We have improved overall on-time performance, become more
efficient in producing capacity from our limited fleet, and
improved accessibility for passengers with disabilities.
Finally, we have continued upgrading our customer
experience with refreshed equipment, improved customer
communications, expanded dining options, better trained
employees, and there is lots more to come.
Driving all of this is our ambitious goal of doubling
ridership by 2040. As our Nation's population grows, we believe
passenger rail can and must play a bigger role. This goal
underlies these investments, our partnerships with States like
North Carolina and the Federal Railroad Administration, and our
evaluation of potential public-private partnerships like the
Texas Central high-speed rail project.
Increasing Amtrak ridership is so important because more
Amtrak passengers mean less congestion on already overcrowded
highways and less need to turn existing interstates into
monster highways, 10 lanes or more. For instance, we all know
how bad traffic is here to the south on I-95. Imagine how much
worse it would be if the over 1.3 million passengers who rode
State-supported Amtrak service along I-95 in Virginia last year
had to drive.
To grow, we will need to both improve existing service and
expand service in States and corridors that we don't serve well
or even at all today.
Our current route map largely reflects an America of 70
years ago. That is why Texas, now our second most populous
State, has only five Amtrak trains a day. And Florida, our
third most populous State, only has 6, compared to the small
but mighty Rhode Island, which has 38 trains per day.
Building enhanced partnerships with our State, commuter,
and host railroad partners is key to this growth. Thankfully,
IIJA funding has encouraged States and others to invest in
intercity passenger rail and created new opportunities for win-
win projects with our freight and commuter partners where we
can improve safety, reliability, and capacity together for all
users.
In fact, much of the rail funding in the IIJA is not going
to Amtrak. Nearly three-quarters of the FRA's national network
grants have gone to California high-speed rail and Brightline
West projects, and two-thirds of the CRISI funds awarded last
year went to short line and regional railroads.
Amtrak supports these investments because they will grow
and improve the whole system, while we use our supplemental
funding to address decades' worth of underinvestment in fleet,
stations, infrastructure, and systems.
It is critical to remember, however, that Amtrak's IIJA
supplemental funds don't cover basic operations and
maintenance. It is essential that we continue to receive
adequate annual appropriations to maintain our assets and
continue serving your communities.
Likewise, while the reauthorization of IIJA is still a
couple years away, I want to state now how important it is that
Congress continue to provide dedicated multiyear funding for
rail. Without guaranteed funding provided by the IIJA, we
simply couldn't make the progress we are accomplishing today.
Sustained funding will allow intercity passenger rail to, at
last, fulfill its potential to alleviate congestion, enhance
mobility, and spur economic development throughout the Nation.
I am thrilled to be part of this extraordinary time in
Amtrak's history. I thank the members of this subcommittee, Mr.
Chairman, for their support and for support of passenger rail.
I look forward to answering your questions.
[Mr. Gardner's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Stephen Gardner, Chief Executive Officer,
National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak)
Good afternoon, Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Wilson, and Members
of the Subcommittee. My name is Stephen Gardner, and I am the Chief
Executive Officer of Amtrak. Thank you for inviting me to appear before
you today for this Amtrak oversight hearing.
I'd like to begin by reflecting for a moment on someone who is not
with us today: Congressman Donald M. Payne, Jr., the Ranking Member of
this Subcommittee until his untimely passing in April. Congressman
Payne was a great champion of his constituents and the things that he
believed in, and Amtrak is fortunate that one of them was passenger
rail. His death is a great loss to the nation, the people he
represented, his fellow members of the House, and most of all to his
friends and family.
As I come before you today, we are eight and a half months into
Fiscal Year 2024. We are also just past the midpoint of the five-year
authorizations and advance appropriations that the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act (IIIJA) provided for Amtrak and Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA) intercity passenger rail programs. Given
that, I will start with an update on Amtrak's performance during Fiscal
Year 2024 to date. I will then turn to how we are advancing the many
projects and initiatives that the IIJA's substantial, multi-year
funding has allowed us to commence; describe what we are doing to
improve our performance and service; and address some persistent myths
relating to Amtrak that need to be dispelled as we move forward. I will
conclude with what Congress can do to continue, and hopefully
accelerate, the progress Amtrak and its partners have made thanks to
the IIJA's funding as we look ahead to the next surface transportation
reauthorization bill.
Fiscal Year 2024 Performance
I am pleased to report that, for Amtrak, the first eight-and-a-half
months of Fiscal Year 2024 have been marked by a large number of
accomplishments. Many seemed completely out of reach just a few years
ago, as we fought, with Congress and the Administration's help, to
preserve our network during the depths of the pandemic.
I'll start with safety. We have experienced zero NTSB reportable
accidents in Fiscal Year 2024, and currently have no open NTSB accident
investigations. We are sustaining the huge (20%) decrease in employee
injuries we achieved last year and are within striking distance of
meeting our aggressive goal for further reduction. We are also seeing
strong improvement in customer safety. This is a significant
achievement, given all of the operational changes we have undergone and
the new employees we have hired in the past several years. While we can
clearly say that Amtrak has become an even safer railroad over the past
few years, the several serious grade crossing accidents Amtrak trains
operating over host railroads during that period have experienced that
some Subcommittee members may remember underscore the need for more
innovation, higher investment and additional focus on the highway-rail
interface.
Turning to our financial performance, the good news is that our
ridership during the first seven months of Fiscal Year 2024 was 20%
higher, and our ticket revenue 10% higher, than during the same period
last year. Of even greater significance, our fiscal-year-to-date
ridership is higher than during the same period in Fiscal Year 2019. As
planned, we are on target to set a new all-time ridership record by
exceeding the 32.3 million passengers we carried in that record-
breaking year before the COVID-19 pandemic produced huge declines in
ridership from which most North American passenger railroads have yet
to recover. Year-to-date revenue is also higher than in 2019, but has
been impacted by the reduced business travel since the pandemic as
virtual meetings have replaced many short duration business trips.
Despite this, we still anticipate improving our bottom-line performance
with a reduced operating loss this year compared to Fiscal Year 2023.
What is particularly encouraging is that we have achieved this
level of ridership despite two major challenges. The first is that we
have less seat capacity in the marketplace than we did in 2019 and less
than we expected to have this year. This is attributable to delays in
starting service with the new Siemens Venture cars that our state
partners have procured for our Midwestern and California state-
supported routes because of various technical issues, a smaller
available legacy fleet due to a number of cars that are out-of-service
because they require major repairs or federally-mandated overhauls that
were delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and delays in beginning service
of the new Acela trainsets by Alstom on the Northeast Corridor because
of continued testing. The second ridership challenge is that the
Pacific Surfliner route from San Diego to Los Angeles and San Luis
Obispo, our highest ridership route outside of the Northeast Corridor,
pre-pandemic, has been severed on multiple occasions for extended
periods due to worsening erosion at points where its right-of-way runs
beneath bluffs along the Pacific Coast.
Further offsetting our results are the cost headwinds that Amtrak
and other transportation providers are facing. Since 2019, the consumer
price index has increased by 23%. The increases in costs for many of
the goods and services that drive Amtrak's operating expenses, such as
the diesel fuel and electricity that power our trains and insurance and
self-insurance, have been even higher than that. The biggest factor in
our increased costs is the higher wages we are paying to our agreement-
covered employees, which are mostly due to the cost-of-living
adjustments included in the new labor agreements we have entered into
the with the unions that represent the majority of our non-management
employees. Amtrak is also incurring significant costs in areas for
which its expenditures were relatively small just a few years ago. For
example, projected cybersecurity costs in 2024 are nearly seven times
what they were in 2019.
Beginning in 2024, Amtrak is also paying a larger share of the
operating costs of state-supported routes because of changes in the
``Section 209'' State-Supported Service Cost Allocation Methodology
that were adopted as part of the updates to that methodology required
by the IIJA. Amtrak's share of state-supported service operating costs
was 24% higher in the first half of Fiscal Year 2024 than it was in
Fiscal Year 2023.
Another driver of the increase in our operating costs is that the
IIJA transformed Amtrak from being primarily a train operating company
into a train operating company and a very large construction company.
Our capital expenditures have increased from $1.6 billion in Fiscal
Year 2019 to nearly $5 billion this year, and a projected $8.3 billion
next year. That enormous increase in capital spending has been
accompanied by many additional costs in areas such as legal, financial
management, training, human resources and information technology that
we did not have before, and that are considered operating costs under
the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, that apply to
corporations--rather than public agencies--like Amtrak. We will
continue to take actions to improve our financial performance and
operate more efficiently, with the goal of improving our financial
results each year and being able to invest more of the federal funds we
receive in modernizing our system rather than providing operating
support.
Advancing Major Capital Investments
Infrastructure Projects
In this new era of investment, Amtrak, in conjunction with our
state and commuter partners, is finally advancing the many major
infrastructure projects along the Northeast Corridor that have long
dominated our list of most-urgent needs. Many of these projects have
recently achieved or will soon reach major milestones.

Construction on the Hudson Tunnel Project, the most
important component of the New York/New Jersey Gateway Program, is
underway on both sides of the Hudson River.

On the opposite side of New York Penn Station, we
recently awarded the construction contract for the rehabilitation of
the four tubes of the 114-year-old East River Tunnel, two of which were
flooded by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. That work will commence later this
year.

Construction of the Portal North Bridge, another key
Gateway project led by NJ Transit in partnership with Amtrak, is 58%
complete.

Replacement of the 117-year-old Connecticut River Bridge
in Old Saybrook, Connecticut is expected to commence later this year.

Construction of the replacement for the 118-year-old
Susquehanna River Rail Bridge in Perryville, Maryland is projected to
begin next year.

The contract for construction of the Frederick Douglass
Tunnel in Baltimore was awarded in February, and major construction
work on the project is also expected to begin later this year.

Calling any of these investments once-a-generation projects would
be a major understatement. All of them replace or supplant
infrastructure assets that are over 100 years old; the Baltimore &
Potomac Tunnel that the Frederick Douglass Tunnel will replace turned
151 years old earlier this month.
Station Redevelopment
We have also achieved significant milestones in several major
station development projects.

Work on the Chicago Hub Improvement Project (CHIP) will
commence following its receipt of two Federal State Partnership for
Intercity Passenger Rail (FSP) grants. CHIP is a joint program being
developed by Amtrak, commuter rail service provider Metra, and the
Departments of Transportation of Illinois, Michigan and Chicago in
conjunction with host railroads that will significantly enhance the
passenger rail experience and rail infrastructure in and around
Amtrak's Chicago Union Station (CUS), the various rail lines leading to
them, and on the Amtrak-owned portion of the Chicago-Detroit/Pontiac
Wolverine route. Amtrak and its partners are continuing to seek
additional grants to advance CHIP, which would ultimately reduce trip
times, improve reliability and increase yard and station capacity for
Midwestern state-supported and long-distance routes serving Chicago.

Construction has commenced on the redevelopment of
William H. Gray III Philadelphia 30th Street Station, Amtrak's third
most heavily used station.

In January, Amtrak completed construction of the first of
two new high-level platforms at Baltimore Penn Station that will
provide capacity for expanded Amtrak and MARC commuter rail service and
enhance accessibility. Work to bring the station into a state-of-good
repair, expand its footprint, and enhance the experience of those who
use it is expected to commence later this year.

Two major developments regarding Washington Union Station
(WUS) will allow Amtrak, working with FRA and the Union Station
Redevelopment Corporation (USRC), to finally move forward on WUS's
long-needed revitalization and expansion. In March, FRA completed the
final environmental impact statement for the multi-year Station
Expansion Project that Amtrak first proposed in 2012. With this
finished, Amtrak and our partners can now begin the process of
prioritizing projects, undertaking the preliminary engineering and
design work, and developing the governance and funding models necessary
to support future construction work. Additionally, Amtrak is scheduled
on July 15 to take possession of the sublease for the historic station
building it is purchasing, much of which is occupied today by a mix of
active and vacant retail and restaurants and unused office space. This
will allow Amtrak, working with USRC, FRA, and our other partners, to
advance initial capital investments that will include expanding
passenger waiting areas, improvements in passenger services and
security, and state of good repair work. These developments are very
good news not only for Amtrak's passengers, but also for passengers on
the Virginia Railway Express, MARC and Washington Metro trains and
intercity buses that serve WUS, and the many Washingtonians and
visitors from around the world who visit the station and patronize its
amenities.
New Equipment
We also continue to move forward with procurement and delivery of
new equipment for all three of our service lines that will allow us to
replace old and obsolete fleet, create more capacity to meet the
growing demand for our service, and greatly improve our customers'
experience when they travel with us. These efforts include:

Acela--High-speed testing of the new Acela trainsets on
the NEC is underway following Alstom's advancement of the FRA-required
computer modeling process preceding such testing. Based on currently
available data from Alstom, we anticipate that initial revenue service
could begin around the end of this year, depending on the outcome of
testing now underway. Amtrak is fully prepared to bring the trains into
service as soon as they receive the required FRA certification.

Corridor Fleet--Production of the Siemens-built Amtrak
Airo trainsets we are acquiring for operation on Northeast Regional
trains on the Northeast Corridor and state-supported services in the
East and Pacific Northwest is well underway, and on target for
projected initial service in 2026 on the state-supported Amtrak
Cascades Vancouver-Seattle-Portland-Eugene route. Deliveries and entry
into service of the Siemens-built state partner-owned Venture cars for
operation on state-supported routes in the Midwest and California are
continuing.

Long Distance Fleet--Last December, Amtrak issued a
Request for Proposals for reequipping much of our long-distance fleet,
most of which is over 40 years old. This procurement process is
underway now and we anticipate placing an order for new passenger cars,
the largest in our history, in 2025. The new equipment will enormously
improve the customer experience, accessibility and operational
efficiency of many long-distance routes. Additionally, deliveries and
operation of the Siemens-built ALC-42 locomotives for our long-distance
services continue, which will allow Amtrak to retire its aging and
less-efficient P42 diesel fleet.
Other Investments and Initiatives
Increasing Capacity to Meet Demand
We are taking a number of steps to provide additional capacity with
our existing fleet to help meet the growing demand for Amtrak service,
increase ridership, and improve financial performance.

We are continuing to restore to service repairable
railcars that require major repairs due to damage in incidents and cars
have been stored because they need federally-mandated overhauls that
were delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We have recently implemented a program of ``quick turns''
on Northeast Regional and Acela trains whose trips end in Washington,
D.C., New York City and Boston to enable them to make more trips and
allow us to increase frequencies between these important markets. Under
this program, certain trains are now serviced at station platforms
rather than being moved to our maintenance facilities at the end of
their trips, allowing them to promptly begin a return trip once
serviced. This has allowed us to add four weekday and two weekend round
trips between New York City and Washington with our existing equipment
fleet.
Enhancing Accessibility
A key priority for Amtrak and this Subcommittee has been improving
accessibility across our network and achieving full compliance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Now, with the funding provided
by the IIJA, Amtrak is making sweeping investments across our assets to
accomplish this.

Each of our new fleet types referenced above, whether
currently in production or in procurement, will significantly improve
accessibility and enhance the customer experience for passengers with a
disability. New features, depending on the fleet, include expanded
restrooms, additional accessible seating, induction loops for low-
vision passengers, car-borne lifts, and many others.

We are making strong progress on our goal of achieving
compliance at all stations for which we have ADA responsibility. We
completed work on 15 stations during Fiscal Year 2023, have completed
eight more so far this year, and expect to bring nine additional
stations into compliance by the end of the year, for a total of 17 in
Fiscal Year 2024. Most of these stations are located on long-distance
and state-supported routes across our National Network. We currently
have 43 station ADA construction projects and 144 design projects
underway.

We also continue to make targeted improvements to our
existing fleet, including installing redesigned ADA-accessible
bathrooms that accommodate larger wheelchairs and include a changing
room on 23 Superliner I coaches and technology platforms to facilitate
better digital access to Amtrak's booking channels and online content.

Finally, we continue to strengthen training and customer
service practices to support our customers with a disability.

We'd also like to thank Representative Molinaro, Subcommittee
Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Wilson and other cosponsors for the
introduction and recent passage of the Think Differently Transportation
Act, which would require inclusion of the ADA status of all Amtrak-
served stations in Amtrak's General and Legislative Annual Report.
Amtrak supports your efforts and remains committed to working with you
and others to make our stations and trains accessible.
Safety and Security
Despite the current challenges in hiring qualified law enforcement
officers, the Amtrak Police Department (APD) is nearly fully staffed
with 427 commissioned police officers, only four short of full
staffing. Its work to make our trains and stations safer is paying off:
Crimes Against Persons have decreased 35%, and Crimes Against Property
26%, over the last four years. APD is taking a number of actions to
improve safety and security. They include the following:

Our Operation RAILSAFE Partner Training Program
strengthens coordination and integration between APD and partner public
safety agencies. Twelve training sessions with local law enforcement
agencies are planned this year and in Fiscal Year 2025.

To enhance communication and decision-making processes to
be better prepared to address major security threats, we frequently
hold tabletop and full-scale multiagency security exercises.

APD has increased the deployment of officers on trains
throughout Amtrak's network, using a data driven approach that focuses
on routes and segments based on historical data. The increased
visibility of officers is aimed at deterrence and enhancing
communication with crews and passengers.

APD provides Conflict Resolution Training for frontline
employees to enable them to better defuse emotionally charged
interactions with aggressive passengers.

Unfortunately, Amtrak is receiving significantly less funding for
safety and security through appropriations to the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) than we did in the past. DHS funding has
decreased from $25 million in the late 2000s to only $9 million last
year, a more than 75% reduction when inflation is taken into account.
Cybersecurity
As I am sure all of you are aware, cybersecurity risks are a
rapidly growing threat, particularly for a public-facing company like
Amtrak that operates vital infrastructure. To address these threats,
Amtrak has advanced our cybersecurity capabilities and resources,
focusing on digital forensics, insider threats, incident response and
security awareness and education. We have enhanced our existing
partnerships with federal security agencies, and are building
capabilities to enable the company to comply with increasing government
and industry mandates and regulatory requirements. We have received
approval from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for our
Cybersecurity Implementation Plan in compliance with the Transportation
Security Administration's Rail Security Directives. As I noted earlier,
Amtrak's expenses to counter cybersecurity threats are increasing
rapidly, and additional funding will be needed to address them.
Grade Crossings
All stakeholders must do everything they can to reduce tragic
railroad grade crossing accidents. Amtrak is focusing on identifying,
evaluating, prioritizing and implementing advanced engineering,
enforcement and education-driven mitigations in partnership with those
that own and manage these crossings. Specific initiatives include:

Upgrading grade crossings along the route of our planned
New Orleans to Mobile, Alabama service with the Consolidated Rail
Infrastructure and Safety Improvement (CRISI) grant we received last
year and matching funds provided by Amtrak and our partners.

The Mississippi-Louisiana Grade Crossing Improvement
Project, for which we received a Federal-State Partnership for
Intercity Passenger Rail grant to evaluate potential improvements to
395 highway-rail grade crossings on the CN-owned rail line over which
our Chicago-to-New Orleans City of New Orleans operates.
Serving Our Customers
Finally, we are continuing to make investments and advance
initiatives to improve customer service. Among them:

We are investing $28 million to refresh the nearly 400
cars in our Superliner fleet, which operate primarily on Western long-
distance trains.

Upgrades of our onboard Wi-Fi to 5G on many routes,
including Northeast Regional, will provide passengers with
significantly more bandwidth. We recently issued two Requests for
Information (RFIs) to assess interest from potential partners in
designing, deploying and operating Fiber Optics Background for Train to
Ground network connectivity along the Northeast Corridor, which would
improve on-board passenger Wi-Fi service while also providing the
improved communication for operational purposes our new,
technologically advanced equipment fleet will require.

We have recently upgraded the Cafe menu on our Acelas to
provide passengers with more healthy and fresh food choices. We have
also restored traditional dining on our Silver Service trains between
New York City and Miami, and are making that service available to coach
as well as private room passengers. We are piloting a new, enhanced
version of our flexible dining service in our dining cars on the New
York City-to-Chicago Lake Shore Limited route, and have reinstated a
dining car on the New York City-to-New Orleans Crescent route to
provide better meal service.
Expanding Service
Amtrak is actively engaged with the Federal Railroad Administration
(``FRA'') and our local, state and private sector partners to advance
the expansion of intercity passenger rail service contemplated by the
IIJA.

We recently added a new state-supported route, the St.
Paul-Milwaukee-Chicago Borealis, on which we began operating a daily
round trip on May 21. The Borealis is our 29th state-supported route,
and its inauguration makes Minnesota, which is funding the service
along with our existing state partner, Wisconsin, our 21st state
partner. We are also working very hard with FRA and our state, local
and host railroad partners to resolve the final remaining issues to
allow Amtrak to, at long last, commence operation of two daily, state-
supported round trips between New Orleans and Mobile.

In December, we began operation of two additional round
trips between Seattle and Portland on the state-supported Amtrak
Cascades route. Earlier this month, we added a third round trip on the
state-supported Valley Flyer route between Springfield and Greenfield,
Massachusetts.

Amtrak is supporting our state partners and FRA as they
develop plans for service on many of the 69 routes throughout the
country that FRA has recently selected for inclusion in the FRA-led
Corridor Identification and Development (Corridor ID) Program created
by the IIJA. Last October, I joined Louisiana's governor on an
inspection train between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that operated in
conjunction with the signing of a service development agreement to
advance plans for Amtrak service between those cities. In March, we
operated an inspection train between Fort Collins and Denver, Colorado,
the potential first segment of Front Range Passenger Rail service that
would continue south of Denver to Pueblo, Colorado. In May, Colorado's
governor signed legislation authorizing a congestion impact fee that
would provide state funding for that service.

Among the routes FRA selected for the Corridor ID Program
are four routes for which Amtrak submitted applications: an extension
of Northeast Corridor service from New York City to Ronkonkoma on Long
Island; the Texas Central project described below; and increasing
service frequency on two Amtrak long distance routes, the New York
City-to-Chicago Cardinal and New Orleans-to-Los Angeles Sunset Limited,
from tri-weekly to daily.

Amtrak is also participating in the FRA-led Long Distance
Study, directed by the IIJA, that is evaluating potential expansion of
long distance service. FRA is expected to issue its report later this
year.
High Speed Rail
A key element of an expanded national intercity network is the
development of high-speed rail corridors. Amtrak strongly believes that
the United States can support dedicated, high-speed intercity corridors
in select markets. As a nation, we have several city-pairs that have
the population density, growth, and travel demand to support
operationally self-sufficient high-speed operations if, as everywhere
else across the globe, the public sector provides critical capital to
build the infrastructure required. The benefits of such investments
would be enormous--and frankly, there's no other feasible alternative
on the table to expand transportation capacity in many of these
corridors, where interstates and airports are already constrained and
have no viable means of being expanded.
In pursuit of this vision, we are continuing to explore a potential
public-private partnership to advance the Texas Central Dallas-to-
Houston high-speed rail project. The Dallas-to-Houston corridor has the
same characteristics as highly successful high-speed rail services
around the world. It is a 240-mile, ``too short to fly/too long to
drive'' route that links the fourth and fifth largest metropolitan
areas in the United States. Interstate 45, which connects Dallas and
Houston, is already severely congested, and with Texas experiencing the
fastest population growth of any U.S. state that congestion is only
going to increase. We believe that high-speed rail operating at a
maximum speed of 205 miles per hour would provide a faster, less
stressful travel alternative for those who currently must drive, or who
travel on the 114 airline flights a day between Houston and Dallas/Fort
Worth. The Texas Central project, which has been underway for more than
a decade, is well advanced: planning and design are largely completed,
and FRA approvals required by environmental laws and for the use of the
planned high-speed equipment have already been obtained. It is a great
opportunity to bring high-speed rail to a corridor where it is badly
needed, and for which it is a perfect fit.
We are proudly partnering with North Carolina and Virginia to
reactivate the S Line between Petersburg, Virginia and Raleigh, North
Carolina for up to 125 miles per hour operation. I'm sure you will be
hearing more about that very exciting project, which will create a
corridor extending approximately 900 miles from Boston to Charlotte
with frequent service and trains operating up to 110/125 miles per hour
on many segments, from Julie White of our state partner, the North
Carolina Department of Transportation, when she appears before you
today.
Amtrak's Transformation
By providing the funding required for vital and long overdue major
capital projects, the IIJA has given Amtrak the greatest opportunity to
improve our network throughout the country in our 53-year history. It
has also given us the two greatest challenges Amtrak has faced. The
first challenge is rapidly transforming a company that operates trains
into a company that does that and carries out some of the largest
infrastructure projects in the United States. The second challenge is
simultaneously constructing multiple major infrastructure and state of
good repair projects along the Northeast Corridor, the most heavily
trafficked rail corridor in the United States while continuing to
accommodate the approximately 2,000 Amtrak, commuter and freight trains
that operate over the Northeast Corridor each weekday.
We have been preparing to meet those challenges since the enactment
of the IIJA. The first thing we did was to enhance our most important
asset: our workforce. We have attracted to Amtrak many of the most
qualified passenger rail professionals in the United States to fill key
leadership roles in areas such as capital project delivery, corridor
and high-speed rail development and passenger railcar procurement. We
have also hired thousands of new employees to perform the work the IIJA
is funding.
While many of the new craft employees we have hired have
specialized skills and years of relevant experience, others are new to
our industry or their trades. In some cases there are simply not enough
qualified ``new hires'' who possess the skills we need in the locations
where we need them. To address that problem, we have established new
training and apprenticeship programs, and have recently applied for
several FRA CRISI grants for additional workforce development
initiatives.
We are also working to improve efficiency and project delivery. In
consultation with our commuter partners and our labor unions, we are
focusing on performing major infrastructure projects service at times
when there are fewer trains and passengers on the railroad, and
adjusting schedules to enable us to take tracks out of service for
extended periods. This not only minimizes disruptions to the bulk of
Amtrak's and our commuter rail partner's passengers--it also greatly
enhances productivity because our maintenance-of-way crews can get more
done when they do not have to constantly stop their work to allow
trains to safely pass through the work zone.
Our current project to completely replace both tracks on the
Lancaster-to-Harrisburg section of our Philadelphia-to-Harrisburg
Keystone Corridor illustrates the benefits of this approach. Instead of
performing the work in a piecemeal fashion over a multi-year period, we
are taking tracks out of service for two periods totaling six hours a
day in between the morning and late afternoon peak travel periods, with
a two-hour mid-day work stoppage to allow high ridership Pittsburgh-to-
New York City trains to pass through the work zone. This approach has
more than doubled productivity, which will allow the work to be
completed in seven months rather than two years, is currently expected
to save approximately $25 million that we can invest in other projects,
and will have fewer impacts on passengers.
Amtrak is also taking innovative approaches in project management
and redevelopment projects with private sector partners. We are using
an innovative ``Delivery Partner'' construction management approach for
Frederick Douglass Tunnel project, under which the private partner
shares in Amtrak's risk to deliver the project and is incentivized to
help Amtrak achieve desired outcomes. On station development projects
at major Amtrak-owned stations, we have entered into master development
agreements with private sector partners who have expertise in
financing, project delivery, asset management and commercial
development to advance station improvements and generate economic
development in the surrounding areas.
We are also enhancing our financial accountability and transparency
to reflect the changes in our company the IIJA has brought about and
the huge increase in Amtrak capital projects and expenditures resulting
from it. We recognize that Amtrak must demonstrate that it is a
responsible steward of the taxpayer funding the IIJA has provided, and
that we are using that funding in an efficient, accountable manner.
Five Myths Regarding Amtrak
I'd like to turn now to addressing five of the most common myths
relating to Amtrak and intercity passenger rail, many of which I am
sure you have heard.

Myth number one: The IIJA's advance appropriations gave Amtrak all
the money we need.
As you've heard me say today and many times before, Amtrak is
extraordinarily grateful for the unprecedented level of federal funding
we are receiving through the IIJA's $66 billion in advance
appropriations for rail. But much of that $66 billion will not go to
Amtrak; the funding we do receive can only be used for specified
purposes and cannot be used to address many of our basic needs; and it
won't be enough to address a half century of inadequate funding for the
Northeast Corridor and intercity passenger rail. For instance:

$3 billion of the advance appropriations are for a grade
crossing elimination program for which Amtrak is not an eligible
applicant and another $5 billion are for CRISI grants. While CRISI is a
very important source of funding for certain Amtrak priorities,
particularly for safety and workforce development projects that are not
eligible for other competitive grant programs, intercity passenger rail
projects have received relatively few CRISI grants, more than two-
thirds of which were given to regional and short line freight railroads
in the most recent round of CRISI grant awards.

Nearly three quarters of the funding for Federal State
Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail-National Network grants
awarded to date has gone to two non-Amtrak, high-speed rail projects:
California High-Speed Rail and the private Brightline West project to
build a high-speed rail line between Las Vegas and Rancho Cucamonga,
California.

While the up to $24 billion for Federal State Partnership
grants for the Northeast Corridor are allowing Amtrak and its commuter
rail partners to move forward with the long deferred major capital
investments I described above, the Northeast Corridor has unfunded
needs of approximately $100 billion over the next 13 years for planned
state-of-good-repair and improvement projects.

Advance appropriations can only be used for limited
purposes that do not include operating costs or many vital capital
projects.

Myth number two: Amtrak is an unfair burden on freight railroads
that impairs their freight operations.
Accommodating Amtrak trains and expansion of Amtrak service was
part of the ``Grand Bargain,'' as the Surface Transportation Board
(STB) has characterized it, that the railroad industry eagerly agreed
to in the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970. Relief from their common
carrier obligation to operate intercity passenger trains on which they
were losing huge amounts of money played no small part in the
transformation of the financially distressed ``railroads'' of 1970 into
the highly profitable ``freight railroads'' of today.
The notion that current or potential future Amtrak operations
impede freight traffic ignores the facts.

Amtrak trains account for less than 5% of the train miles
on Class I railroads.

Freight traffic on Class I railroads has decreased more
than 15% since 2006.

Amtrak compensates freight railroads for the additional
costs they incur as a result of its operations; also pays them
incentive payments for good on-time performance; and indemnifies them
for most of the costs associated with incidents involving Amtrak
trains, even if the freight railroad is at fault.

Amtrak, the federal government and our state partners
have funded investments on nearly every Amtrak route to increase
capacity to accommodate Amtrak trains, and to upgrade tracks and other
infrastructure, including the installation of Positive Train Control
and other safety improvements. These publicly funded infrastructure
investments have been particularly beneficial to the short lines and
regional railroads on which Amtrak has added service, funding joint
benefit investments they could not otherwise have afforded that have
enabled them to handle heavier freight cars, increase freight train
speeds and enhance safety.

The IIJA provides billions of dollars in funding for many
more such investments in host railroad infrastructure to upgrade,
increase capacity on, and enhance the safety of freight railroad-owned
lines over which Amtrak presently operates or will operate in the
future. This additional funding will facilitate infrastructure
investments that will benefit both freight and Amtrak services. One
example is the $3.7 billion Transforming Rail in Virginia partnership
among Amtrak, the Commonwealth of Virginia, CSX and Norfolk Southern,
and Virginia Railway Express that Andy Daly of CSX described at the
Subcommittee's hearing last November.

Myth number three: Profitability is the measure of Amtrak's
success.
Amtrak's statutory mission and goals make no mention of
profitability. Rather, they direct Amtrak to provide efficient and
effective intercity passenger rail service that maximizes the benefits
of federal investments. Intercity passenger rail service in the United
States ceased to be profitable after World War II, when construction of
federal highways and expansion of airports and airline service, aided
in both cases by government subsidies, brought an end to railroads'
once dominant position in intercity passenger travel. Indeed, the
unprofitability of intercity passenger rail service is the very reason
Amtrak was created.
The vast majority of Amtrak's operating losses are attributable to
the operation of the long-distance routes Congress has directed Amtrak
to provide. While these routes play an important role in providing
mobility for residents of many rural and small communities, providing
such services is inherently unprofitable. The other public
transportation services in rural and small communities--essential air
service, local transit buses, and rural intercity bus service--
generally receive much higher levels of federal funding per passenger
mile to cover their operating losses than Amtrak does. And no one
expects our federal highway system, which has benefited from the over
$200 billion federal taxpayer bailout of the Highway Trust Fund's
Highway Account since it became insolvent in 2008, to make a profit.
Rather than profitability, federal transportation spending is
rightfully judged by its effectiveness in achieving a set of important
economic and public benefit goals. Investing in expanded mobility pays
big dividends: enhanced economic and community development, improved
quality of life, more job opportunities, an improved environment,
strengthened community and family ties, and increased national
competitiveness. Amtrak's goals are to constantly improve our
efficiency while meeting the needs of our customers and the communities
we serve. While we will continue to work towards reaching financial
break-even on our train operations, as we do that we will remain
focused on our ``true'' bottom line, which is how much value we create
for the American people and the American economy by providing our
services.

Myth number four: It makes sense to limit Amtrak service to the
routes we already serve.
You have heard me say before that Amtrak's route map looks little
different from when we began operations in 1971, since our route
mileage and most of the routes on our National Network have changed
very little since then. But what our route network really reflects is
where Americans lived and traveled in about 1950. That's when private
railroads stopped adding passenger trains in regions and corridors
where populations were growing rapidly, and instead began doing
everything they could to get out of the passenger rail business. That
explains why Texas, which had a population of less than eight million
people in 1950, has only five Amtrak trains a day to serve its current
population of over thirty million that makes it our second largest
state. And why Florida, whose population of less than three million
people in 1950 has grown to nearly 23 million today, making it our
third largest state, is served by only six Amtrak trains a day.
Virtually the only places where Amtrak service has increased since
1971 are the Northeast Corridor, which already had a large population
in 1950 and benefited from significant federal investment in its rail
infrastructure, and in states that stepped up to provide funding for
Amtrak despite the absence of the federal matching grants they would
have received if they had built highways instead. That is why Amtrak
has little service in the many of the largest and fastest growing
states and regions in the United States. Southwest Airlines, which
began operation the month after Amtrak did, has dramatically increased
service, benefiting from the sustained public investments in airports
and our air traffic control system. So should Amtrak.

And the last myth: The choice is between expanding passenger rail
and doing nothing.
This is a myth because the U.S. population is growing, travel
demand is increasing, and our highways and our aviation system are
already serving many more travelers than they can efficiently and
safely handle. According to the Federal Highway Administration,
increased traffic over the next two decades will overwhelm our existing
national highway system: severe highway congestion, which today mostly
occurs around major cities, will extend along the entire length of most
highways within heavily traveled corridors throughout the United
States.
Adding enough lanes to accommodate all of this additional traffic
would require turning many interstate highways that have six or eight
lanes today into monster highways with 10, 12 or even 14 lanes. That's
already happening around many major metropolitan areas. On most
interstates, the existing right-of-way isn't wide enough to accommodate
all of the additional lanes that would be needed to accommodate the
traffic growth FHWA projects, and the elaborate flyovers and
interchanges that highways with so many lanes require. That means that
homes and businesses will have to be displaced. And, of course,
converting today's highways into monster highways will be very
expensive, extremely disruptive, and will be accompanied by lengthy
battles over environmental and community impacts. Turning highways into
monster highways should be the last option, not the default.
Intercity passenger rail, and high-speed rail in markets where it
makes sense, can provide a faster, congestion-free alternative for
those who use them, while freeing up highway capacity for those who
continue to drive and reducing the need for monster highways with their
associated costs and negative community and environmental impacts. So
when we consider intercity passenger and high-speed rail projects, the
question we should be asking isn't how much they will cost and what
impacts they will have. Instead, we should be asking how their costs,
benefits and impacts compare to the alternative of turning existing
highways into monster highways to meet the increased travel demand of a
growing America?
Some places have begun doing that. Virginia decided that it makes
more sense, and will be less expensive, to increase passenger rail
service instead of adding yet another lane to Interstate 95 in each
direction. That decision is already producing many benefits. Last year,
nearly a million people rode Virginia's three state-supported routes
that travel along the Interstate 95 corridor between Washington and
Richmond/Petersburg, Virginia. Another 316,000 rode the Carolinian
route, supported by North Carolina, that continues south to Raleigh and
Charlotte, and many more traveled on the three Amtrak long-distance
routes that also serve the Washington-Richmond/Petersburg corridor.
Amtrak ridership on the state-supported trains along that corridor is
continuing to grow: so far this year it is up by more than 10%.
Imagine how much worse traffic on Interstate 95 would be if all of
those train travelers were driving instead. And imagine how much more
Amtrak service can do once investments are made to expand and upgrade
the tracks along this route to create more frequent and more reliable
service.
Looking Ahead
I will close by discussing what Amtrak needs in the near and longer
term to continue the progress we have made since the enactment of the
IIJA.
I cannot emphasize enough the importance of adequate annual
appropriations. They are essential to the continued operation of both
our long-distance routes and our state-supported routes, and are
Amtrak's only source of funding for many vital capital projects. Many
on this Subcommittee supported Amtrak's request of adequate annual
funding in Fiscal Year 2024, and we are deeply thankful for your
support.
Looking ahead to reauthorization when the IIJA's advance
appropriations and authorizations run out on September 30, 2026--a
little more than two years away--what is absolutely vital is the
continuation of substantial, multi-year funding for Amtrak and rail
competitive grant programs that the IIJA provided for the first time.
Such funding--which nearly every other transportation mode has enjoyed
for decades--is necessary so that we can continue to make essential
investments on the Northeast Corridor and our National Network, and to
allow Amtrak, the FRA and our state partners to turn the vision of
greatly expanded intercity passenger rail service, for which the IIJA
set the stage, into reality.
Amtrak looks forward to working with you and your staffs on a
reauthorization bill that positions intercity passenger rail to play a
much greater role in meeting our nation's transportation needs. While
we do not yet have specific legislative proposals to offer beyond those
included in our most recent annual Legislative Report, I did want to
mention several areas where statutory changes could allow Amtrak to
become more efficient, improve its financial and operational
performance, and facilitate the advancement of major capital projects
and collaboration with our partners.
The first pertains to our statutory preference over freight trains
in dispatching. During the most recent 12-month period (June 2023 to
May 2024), only 57% of our long-distance customers arrived at their
destination on time. Many of the delays they experienced were due to
decisions by some of our host freight railroads to give their freight
trains priority over Amtrak's passengers. We are doing what we can to
address that problem with the statutory remedies available today. In
December of 2022, we petitioned the STB to investigate the on-time
performance of the Sunset Limited, on which 90% of customers had
arrived at their destination late during the two previous calendar
quarters. The STB initiated an investigation in July of last year that
is still underway.
Another is the streamlining of the statutory and regulatory
requirements and processes that pertain to federal capital grant
funding for passenger rail. Federal grant programs for rail, and the
federal laws and regulations that govern administration of grants for
transportation projects, were developed over many years in a piecemeal,
siloed fashion. They were not designed to accommodate the very large
passenger rail projects involving multiple entities and funding sources
that Amtrak and its state and commuter partners are carrying out today.
In some cases, existing impediments to project delivery impose very
significant costs that are a poor use of taxpayer dollars. For example,
because the competitive grants Amtrak receives are reimbursable grants,
which means that Amtrak does not receive grant funds until long after
it has to pay contractors and suppliers, Amtrak must often incur
significant financing costs: $63 million dollars for the project to
replace the Connecticut River Bridge alone. We believe it would be
better if we could use that money for additional infrastructure
improvements rather than giving it to banks.
Finally, we believe that additional dedicated funding should be
provided for intercity passenger rail capital investments to advance
specific priorities and in areas where it is necessary to ensure
adequate funding for reasons beyond the achievement of transportation-
related goals. Examples include high-speed rail, expansion of equipment
fleet to enable more service in emerging corridors, and safety and
security, including cybersecurity.
Conclusion
Amtrak faces many challenges today. But all of us at Amtrak--Tony
Coscia, who you will also hear from today; the other members of our
Board; our 23,500 employees; and I--recognize how very fortunate we
are. We are living the dream--getting to do what our predecessors
throughout Amtrak's first half century could only imagine. The
transformative investments in infrastructure, equipment, stations and
other facilities we are making will position the company to improve our
service, operate more trains to meet growing demand along routes we
already serve, and bring Amtrak service to the places we should be
serving but aren't today to achieve our goal of doubling ridership by
2040.
I am thrilled to be a part of this extraordinary time in Amtrak's
history. I thank you for inviting me to speak with you today, and I
will be happy to answer the questions you have.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mr. Gardner. I see you have a robust
team here. I want to recognize Chief Dotson. It is good to see
you again. We spent some time up in Milwaukee a month or two
ago. And I just thank you for being here.
I now recognize Mr. Coscia for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF ANTHONY COSCIA, CHAIR OF THE BOARD, NATIONAL
RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION (AMTRAK)

Mr. Coscia. Good afternoon, Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member
Wilson, Ranking Member Larsen, and members of the committee. I
am Tony Coscia, the Chairman of Amtrak's Board of Directors on
which I have served since 2010 and chaired since 2013.
While I am grateful for your invitation to speak to you
today, it does sadden me not to see Congressman Donald Payne, a
great Member from the congressional district adjoining mine,
and also a very good friend of mine.
Amtrak has come a long way since 2010. We serve many more
passengers, have become more efficient, and we are very mindful
of our statutory directive to operate as a business while
fulfilling our public service mission.
The role of Amtrak's Board is to set corporate policy and
oversee Amtrak's management. We represent interests of the
Amtrak stakeholders, who include the Federal taxpayers,
customers, employees, and State partners. I hope we soon will
have a full complement of Board members to bring greater
geographic diversity and additional perspectives and expertise.
The Board has played an active role in the implementation
of measures that have materially improved Amtrak's financial
reporting, accountability, and transparency. Amtrak has adopted
expanded internal audit and compliance programs and an
enterprise risk management system, new project controls,
estimating functions, and at the Board's direction, we have
enhanced our collaboration with Amtrak's Office of Inspector
General.
We now hold Board sessions each year with the general
public, labor unions representing our employees, the disability
community, and other stakeholders. And we will begin next month
holding meetings with our State partners.
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA, funding,
for which we are very grateful, will allow Amtrak to make major
capital investments, grow ridership, enhance safety, build
partnerships, and increase our value throughout the Nation. The
IIJA has made accountability and transparency and the Board's
oversight responsibilities even more important. I believe that
Amtrak and its Board are well prepared to assume the additional
responsibilities the IIJA has given us.
One of the Board's responsibilities is to set management
compensation policies. I know there have been questions raised
about Amtrak's management incentive compensation program. That
program, which bases a portion of managers' compensation on
performance, was initiated in 2013 in response to a statutory
recommendation and in conjunction with terminating Amtrak's
very costly management pension and post-retirement benefit
programs, which paid benefits regardless of Amtrak's
performance. The management incentive program allowed the
company to attract a stronger management team that
significantly improved financial performance prior to the
COVID-19 pandemic.
As Amtrak emerged from the first year of the pandemic,
during which we suspended our incentive program and imposed
management salary cuts of up to 20 percent, the incentive
program allowed us to rebuild our workforce and attract new
employees with the expertise we needed.
It bears noting that even with the potential management
incentive payments, Amtrak employees, particularly those at the
senior level, generally earn much less than their counterparts
in the freight railroad and other industries with which Amtrak
competes for talent.
That said, I am aware of the bills that were introduced
yesterday regarding transparency around executive compensation.
The Board supports releasing the details of our pay for
performance plan, including the awards to executives, as we
have done in the past. That information will be posted on
Amtrak's website this week.
If Amtrak didn't have the workforce required to manage and
support multiple multibillion-dollar capital projects, it would
have to rely on high-priced consultants to do that for us.
Having chaired the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
while we were rebuilding lower Manhattan after 9/11, I can
attest that relying on consultants would be much more costly
and would greatly increase project risks, as the experience of
rail and transit projects overly dependent on consultants has
demonstrated.
Those of us who live in the Northeast Corridor are very
fortunate. Because of Federal investment, someone traveling
from Washington to northern New Jersey where I live doesn't
have to spend hours in traffic along I-95 or make their way to
the airport to line up for security and sit in long queues of
planes awaiting takeoff. Instead, I can hop on a train at Union
Station, work without interruption, and in less than 3 hours,
be dropped off 200 miles away near my home. I believe that
those who live in other parts of the United States should have
that same benefit.
When Congress reauthorizes surface transportation, I hope
you will decide that intercity passenger rail service should be
an important travel mode throughout the United States and will
provide the resources to allow Amtrak and our partners to make
that vision a reality.
Thank you again for your time, and I am happy to answer any
of your questions.
[Mr. Coscia's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Anthony Coscia, Chair of the Board, National
Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak)
Good afternoon, Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Wilson, and members
of the Subcommittee.
I am Tony Coscia, Chairman of the Amtrak Board of Directors. I have
been a member of Amtrak's Board since 2010 and its chairman since 2013.
While I am grateful for your invitation to speak with you today, it
saddens me to not see Congressman Donald Payne, the great Member from
the Congressional district adjoining mine who was also my friend.
Amtrak has come a long way since 2010. We serve many more
passengers, have become more efficient, and are very mindful of our
statutory directive to operate as a business while fulfilling our
public service mission. Amtrak's Board has played an active role in the
implementation of measures that have materially improved financial
reporting and ensured that our audited financial statements are
delivered in a timely fashion. Adoption of financial and accounting
methods used by private sector companies with SEC-compliance
responsibilities has made our financial reports much more transparent
than at any time in the Company's history.
I am particularly pleased to be here following the Senate's recent
confirmation of my nomination to serve a third term on Amtrak's Board.
I am very excited about the opportunities the funding Congress provided
in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA. This historic
investment in passenger rail will allow Amtrak to begin improving our
infrastructure, facilities and equipment on the Northeast Corridor and
National Network, grow ridership, enhance safety, build partnerships,
and increase Amtrak's value in all parts of the nation.
The role of Amtrak's Board is to set corporate policy and oversee
Amtrak's management. Just as the Board members of private companies
represent shareholders, our job is to represent the interests of
Amtrak's stakeholders, who include federal taxpayers, our customers,
our employees, and our state partners, and to try to advance and
balance their many interests and needs. IIJA funding, for which we are
very grateful, has enormously increased the Board's oversight
responsibilities and their importance. Amtrak's current Board,
comprised of both long-serving members and very knowledgeable newly
confirmed members, is well qualified for that task. I am hopeful that
we will soon have a full complement of Board members to bring greater
geographic diversity and additional perspectives and expertise to the
Board.
One of the Board's responsibilities is to set management
compensation policies. I know that questions have been raised about
Amtrak's management incentive compensation program. That program, which
bases a portion of managers' compensation on performance, was initiated
in 2013 in response to a statutory recommendation and in conjunction
with terminating Amtrak's very costly management pension and post-
retirement benefit programs, which provided benefits regardless of
Amtrak's performance.
Amtrak's ability to offer reasonable compensation packages to
prospective employees, the vast majority of whom come from the private
sector, allowed the company to attract a stronger management team that
significantly improved financial performance prior to the COVID-19
pandemic. As Amtrak emerged from the first year of the pandemic, during
which we suspended our incentive program and imposed mandatory salary
cuts of up to 20% across all of management, and the Company assumed its
greatly increased responsibilities under the IIJA, the management
incentive program allowed us to rebuild our workforce and attract new
employees with the expertise we needed. It bears noting that, even when
potential performance-based payments under the management incentive
program are taken into account, Amtrak's management employees,
particularly at senior levels, generally earn much less than their
counterparts in the freight railroad and other industries with which
the company competes for talent.
If Amtrak didn't have the workforce required to manage and support
multiple multi-billion-dollar capital projects, it would have to rely
on high-priced consultant practices to do that for us. As someone with
a lot of experience with mega projects--I chaired the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey while it was rebuilding Lower Manhattan after
9/11--I can attest that relying on consultants would be much more
costly to taxpayers and would greatly increase project risks, as the
experience of rail and transit projects overly dependent on consultants
has demonstrated.
Amtrak's Board recognizes that the IIJA and the funding it provides
increase the need for accountability and transparency. Amtrak has
adopted expanded internal audit and compliance programs and an
enterprise risk management system, new project controls and estimating
functions, and at the Board's direction enhanced Amtrak's collaboration
with Amtrak's Office of Inspector General. We hold three Board sessions
each year with the general public, the labor unions representing our
employees and the disabled community, and Board members also engage
regularly with many stakeholders. Because Amtrak operates as a
business, unlike public agencies, it has commercially sensitive
information that must be protected to avoid competitive and financial
harm. Amtrak's transparency regarding its finances and operations is
evident from a review of the many detailed reports we regularly produce
and post on our website, which can be found at https://www.amtrak.com/
about-amtrak/reports-documents.html.
I will close by acknowledging that, when it comes to intercity
transportation, those of us who live along the Northeast Corridor are
very fortunate. Due to the federal investment in passenger rail in that
Corridor, someone traveling from Washington to Northern New Jersey
where I live doesn't have to spend hours in traffic along Interstate
95, or make their way to the airport to line up for security and sit in
a long queue of planes awaiting takeoff. Instead, they can hop on an
Amtrak train at Washington Union Station, work without interruption,
and in less than three hours be dropped off 200 miles away near their
homes.
I believe those who live elsewhere in the United States should have
the option of traveling by train as well. That's why I support targeted
expansion of Amtrak's National Network, and partnerships between Amtrak
and its state partners and host railroads to bring high-quality
intercity and high-speed passenger rail service to the places
throughout the country where it is badly needed. As the members of
Congress look towards reauthorization of surface transportation, I hope
they will decide that intercity passenger rail service should be an
important mode in our transportation system throughout the United
States, and will provide the resources to allow Amtrak and its partners
to make that vision a reality.
I thank you for your time and will be happy to answer your
questions.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mr. Coscia.
I would like to now recognize Mrs. Foushee to introduce our
next witness.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
It gives me great pleasure to introduce one of our
witnesses here today, from my home State, the North Carolina
Department of Transportation's Deputy Secretary for Multimodal
Transportation, Julie White.
It is great to see you again, Ms. White. There have been a
number of exciting developments and investments of late in
North Carolina's passenger rail systems. So, I think it is very
timely to have you here before this committee today.
I look forward to hearing more about the work that the
North Carolina Department of Transportation is doing to make
rail travel more affordable and accessible for the folks back
home and how they are partnering with Amtrak to do so. It is
also my sincere hope that this might prove to be an opportunity
for others to learn from the great strides we in the Tar Heel
State are making in passenger rail.
My colleagues and I on this committee are so thankful that
you are here and a part of this hearing today, Deputy
Secretary, and we greatly look forward to your testimony.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Nehls. Ms. White, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF JULIE A. WHITE, DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR MULTIMODAL
TRANSPORTATION, NORTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

Ms. White. Good afternoon, and thank you.
Thank you, Congresswoman, thank you, Chairman Nehls,
Ranking Member Wilson, Ranking Member Larsen, and all the
members of the subcommittee, for holding this hearing to
discuss passenger rail as an integral part of our national
transportation system.
As the Congresswoman said, my name is Julie White, and I am
the deputy secretary for multimodal transportation at the North
Carolina Department of Transportation, where I oversee our
rail, aviation, ferry, public transit, bicycle, and pedestrian
divisions. I also chair the Southeast Corridor Commission, a
regional rail partnership whose cooperation is advancing our
shared vision for high-performance rail throughout the
Southeast mega-region.
I want to thank Congress for its support of the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, which has significantly advanced our rail
investments.
North Carolina has received several CRISI grants, a $1
billion Federal-State partnership construction grant, and short
line grants supporting economic development in rural western
and central North Carolina. We are grateful for the bipartisan
support we have received for our Federal competitive grant
applications from both State-elected leaders and our
congressional delegation.
Rail is the only mode that does not enjoy formulaic Federal
funding, meaning projects often languish on shelves awaiting
the right competitive Federal grant opportunity, resulting in
decades' long waits for new service and expired environmental
documents.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law offers a once in a
generation opportunity to demonstrate how your substantial
investment can change this trajectory and set a different
course for the future.
Passenger ridership in North Carolina is at an all-time
high, with 2023 State-supported service ridership 38 percent
higher than prepandemic levels in 2019. We continue to see an
upward trajectory with a 24-percent higher volume in the first
quarter of 2024, as compared to 2023.
Tomorrow, our Open Express train will depart Raleigh Union
Station to travel for the first time all the way to Pinehurst,
North Carolina, bringing attendees to the United States Golf
Association's U.S. Open. We have sold out all four train trips,
further demonstrating the unmet demand for service to new
destinations in our State.
Communities in North Carolina actively sought the
submission of 12 existing rail corridors to the Federal
Railroad Administration's Corridor Identification Development
pipeline program, and we are pleased to share that North
Carolina received a record seven corridors into the program. We
can now provide local government strong estimates of how much
non-Federal match will be needed to advance the corridors,
allowing them to budget accordingly.
Predictable pathways allow local communities to better
communicate plans to citizens and galvanize and maintain the
support needed to lift such large-scale decades' long projects.
With consistent, robust, reliable, and sufficient Federal rail
funding and non-Federal match, we could potentially see service
across our State from Asheville to Wilmington by 2035.
The NCDOT has developed a highly successful partnership
with small and rural communities to advance multimodal
projects. The NCDOT contributes our technical expertise. We
develop the Federal grant applications and administer the
Federal funds, while the local community works with consultants
to design their rail and transit future and provides needed
non-Federal matching funds. Through these partnerships, we have
jointly secured transit-oriented development planning grants
and the funding to advance rail station mobility hubs through
feasibility study, NEPA documentation, and preliminary design.
The Raleigh to Richmond project along the S-Line is a key
initiative reducing travel time between Raleigh and Richmond by
an hour, and providing a car-competitive trip between Raleigh
and Washington, DC. At full build-out, we estimate our annual
ridership will climb to 2.5 million riders. We anticipate our
first groundbreaking this summer, and will apply for future
grants to continue construction north.
As we all know, planning and building infrastructure takes
too long. Through regular, reliable rail funding formulas, we
could significantly shorten the time it takes to put the
investment in the ground as we would be able to program
projects earlier and reduce the need for the months' long
agreements phase.
NCDOT has a strong history of obligating and spending
billions of Federal dollars through formula programs, as do
many others States. Streamlining the discretionary process to
enable similar approvals would be beneficial to all
stakeholders.
The Southeast Corridor Commission and the State of North
Carolina remain committed to partnering with Congress, our
freight rail partners, Amtrak, the FRA, and others to expand
freight and passenger rail in the Southeast. Continued strong
investment in rail in the next reauthorization will enable us
to continue to meet the transportation needs of North
Carolinians in all parts of our State, assist communities in
growing their economic vitality, and provide more opportunities
for the next generation to remain in the communities they grew
up in.
Thank you for the opportunity to address the subcommittee.
[Ms. White's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Julie A. White, Deputy Secretary for Multimodal
Transportation, North Carolina Department of Transportation
Good afternoon, and thank you, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member
Larsen, Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Wilson, and all members of the
Subcommittee for holding this hearing to discuss passenger rail as an
integral part of our national transportation system.
My name is Julie White, and I am the Deputy Secretary for
Multimodal Transportation at the North Carolina Department of
Transportation. I oversee our rail, aviation, ferry, public transit,
bicycle, and pedestrian transportation divisions. Additionally, I serve
on the American Public Transportation Association Board of Directors
and as co-chair of the APTA Commuter Rail and Intercity Legislative
Subcommittee. I am also an active member of the American Association of
State Highway and Transportation Officials Council on Rail
Transportation.
I chair the Southeast Corridor Commission, a regional rail
partnership that includes North Carolina, Washington, D.C., Virginia,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida, whose cooperation is
advancing the Southeast Rail Corridor for direct federal funding,
progressing our shared vision for high-performance rail throughout the
Southeast megaregion.
The SEC works in partnership with the Federal Railroad
Administration, Amtrak, and our freight rail partners to plan regional
rail initiatives, identify shared priorities, and secure consistent
federal funding to improve rail services throughout the Southeast. We
recognize the power of rail to connect our states and local communities
and understand that consistent rail infrastructure investments create
economic growth and opportunity.
A recent study of North Carolina's passenger and freight rail
system identified over $20 billion in economic activity annually,
supporting over 88,000 jobs. Our rail system is crucial for serving the
traveling public, providing cost-effective and sustainable
transportation solutions, connecting urban and rural areas, and
attracting new economic investment. The State of North Carolina,
through the NCDOT, invests in Class I and short line rail
infrastructure projects through our State Transportation Improvement
Program and direct grants to short lines, fully understanding the
benefits of a strong freight rail system to our state's economy.
I want to thank Congress for its support of the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, which has significantly advanced our rail
investments. Investing $66 billion nationwide in rail provides the
opportunity to bring much-needed rail investment across North Carolina
and the southeast and further grow our more rural economies. North
Carolina has received several CRISI grants, a $1 billion Fed-State
Partnership construction grant for the S-Line that aims to join rail
systems across state lines, and short line grants supporting economic
development in rural western and central North Carolina. We are
grateful for the bipartisan support we have received for our federal
competitive grant applications from state elected leaders and our
Congressional delegation.
Rail is the only mode that does not enjoy formulaic federal
funding, meaning projects often languish on shelves awaiting the right
competitive federal grant opportunity to apply for, resulting in
decades long waits for new service and expired environmental documents.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law offers a once-in-a-generation
opportunity to demonstrate how your substantial investment can change
this trajectory and set a different course for the future.
Passenger ridership in North Carolina is at an all-time high, with
2023 state-supported service ridership thirty-eight percent higher than
pre-pandemic levels in 2019. We continue to see an upward trajectory,
with a twenty-four percent higher volume in the first quarter of 2024
compared to the same period in 2023. Our partner state, Virginia, has
also reported record-setting ridership. This trend underscores the post
covid changing travel patterns and the success of intercity rail in
states like ours.
Intercity passenger rail riders seek productive, efficient ways to
travel between municipal centers for work, recreation, healthcare,
education, and other opportunities. Our ridership includes college
students, business commuters, families, and individuals accessing
healthcare and community services. As people shift away from peak
commuter travel patterns and embrace virtual meeting options, train
travel offers valuable work time, unlike driving.
Tomorrow, our ``Open Express'' train will depart Raleigh Union
Station to travel for the first time all the way to Pinehurst bringing
attendees to the United States Golf Association's U.S. Open. We
anticipate fully sold-out trains, which will help to demonstrate the
unmet demand for service to new destinations across our state.
Our local municipal partners recognize the importance of intercity
and urban-rural connections and have demonstrated their enthusiasm and
continued commitment to enhancing and/or bringing passenger rail
service back to their communities. Communities in North Carolina
actively sought the submission of twelve existing rail corridors to the
Federal Rail Administration's Corridor Identification and Development
pipeline program and we are pleased to share that North Carolina
received a record seven corridors into the program. This step unlocks
planning funds so communities may begin the needed service development
planning and identifying the needed infrastructure investments.
Another benefit of the Corridor ID program is that entering a
pipeline for program delivery provides clear sightlines to state and
local government on the needed non-federal match to advance projects.
State and local governments have prescribed budget cycles which do not
align well with discretionary competitive grant programs. For those
corridors now in the Corridor ID program we can provide local
government strong estimates of how much non-federal match will be
needed and when, allowing the local governments to budget accordingly.
Predictable pathways allow local communities to better communicate
plans to citizens and galvanize and maintain the support needed to lift
such large scale and decades long projects.
Through Corridor ID the prospect of connecting our current rail
service to destinations like Asheville, Wilmington and cities in
between keeps our staff busy coordinating with local, state, and
federal partners to expedite service to these corridors. With
consistent, robust, reliable, and sufficient federal rail funding and
non-federal match, we could potentially see service across our state to
Asheville and Wilmington by 2035.
The NCDOT has developed a highly successful partnership with small
and rural communities to advance multimodal projects such as these. The
NCDOT contributes our technical expertise to support the local
communities' desire to grow rail, develops the federal grant
applications and administers the federal funds while the local
community works to design their rail and transit future and provides
the needed non-federal match for the competitive grant. Through these
partnerships we have jointly secured a transit-oriented development
planning grant and the funding to advance rail station mobility hubs
through feasibility study, NEPA documentation and preliminary design.
The Raleigh to Richmond Project along the S-Line is a key
initiative, reducing travel time between Raleigh and Richmond by one
hour and providing a car-competitive trip between Raleigh and
Washington, D.C. This project aims to connect urban and rural
economies, expand workforce access for businesses in our state and grow
our ridership at full build out to two and a half million annual
riders. North Carolina and Virginia have completed the necessary
environmental work and are currently finalizing federal grant
documentation. We anticipate our first groundbreaking this summer, with
future federal grants funding subsequent construction segments.
As we all know, planning and building infrastructure takes too
long. As mentioned earlier, rail has a history of having to pursue
federal funds only through federal discretionary grant opportunities.
Through regular reliable rail formula funding we could significantly
shorten the time it takes to put the investment in the ground as we
would be able to program projects earlier and reduce the need for the
month's long agreements phase. NCDOT has a strong history of obligating
and spending billions of federal dollars through formula programs as do
many other states. Streamlining the discretionary process to enable
similar approvals would be beneficial to all stakeholders.
A key partnership between NCDOT and Amtrak occurs through our work
on the State-Amtrak Intercity Passenger Rail Committee (SAIPRC),
chaired by NCDOT Rail Division Director Jason Orthner. SAIPRC's 21
agencies in 17 states, Amtrak, and the FRA, have been directed by
Congress to collaboratively implement a standard cost-sharing
methodology for the state-supported intercity passenger rail services
across the country.
We are grateful for the investments made possible by Congress and
the FRA to replace our passenger rail fleet, among the oldest in the
nation, with new trains that offer a modern, more comfortable ride with
upgraded amenities. Siemens Mobility, the United States' largest
passenger rolling stock manufacturer, broke ground in August 2023 on a
$220 million facility in Lexington, North Carolina that will create
more than 500 jobs by 2028 and is estimated to grow the state's economy
by $1.6 billion over 12 years. Some of the most innovative and
sustainable passenger trains in the North American market will be
manufactured in our own backyard. Siemens plans to manufacture not only
the trains currently on order from the BIL but also the future rolling
stock that will be needed to serve the new passenger rail connections
the Corridor Identification and Development program seeks to grow.
The Southeast Corridor Commission and the State of North Carolina
remain committed to partnering with Congress, freight railroads,
Amtrak, and others to expand freight and passenger rail in the
Southeast. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a historic opportunity
to build upon our joint work to date, connect rural and urban
communities, and provide our residents with access to jobs and the
economy. Continued strong investment in rail in the next
reauthorization will enable us to continue to meet the transportation
needs of North Carolinians in all parts of our State, assist
communities in growing their economic vitality, and provide more
opportunities for the next generation to remain in the communities they
grew up in. Thank you for the opportunity to address the subcommittee.
We look forward to continuing our partnership to expand our nation's
high-performance passenger rail systems.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Ms. White.
And thank you all for your testimony. We will now turn to
questions for the panel. And I will recognize myself for 5
minutes.
Mr. Gardner, again, thank you for being here. My question
is related to the Government in the Sunshine Act, or Sunshine
Act, which was created to promote and improve transparency and
decisionmaking in the Government. Under this law, agency
meetings must generally be open to the public. Makes sense.
The Supreme Court recognized Amtrak's Federal status, and
found in DOT v. Association of American Railroads that Amtrak
was created by the Government, is controlled by the Government,
and operates for the Government's benefit. Given Amtrak's
Federal status, why has Amtrak continued to violate the
Sunshine Act?
Mr. Gardner. Thank you, Chairman Nehls. I believe that
Amtrak, in the nineties, through a series of work with our
counsel and others, determined that the Sunshine Act itself
didn't apply to Amtrak at that time. As you have said, we are
certainly an entity owned by the Federal Government, but we are
a corporation established under the DC Corporate Act.
So, we certainly could get back to you on the specifics
there about the application of that statute. Certainly, as the
Chairman said, we intend and we have been following the recent
changes in the IIJA to engage the public and have more public
input with the Board meetings.
Mr. Nehls. Just getting you to commit to implementing some
measures that will bring you into compliance with it, is why we
are asking. It is just get into compliance with the Sunshine
Act. I don't think it is that difficult to do.
Mr. Gardner. OK. We certainly can look at that. Again, I
think that the issue applies to the governance of the company,
and we can take a look.
Mr. Nehls. Everything's about transparency. We know how
important it is.
So, Mr. Coscia, how would the transparency measures
required under the Sunshine Act improve the operation of
Amtrak's Board of Directors? And will you commit to complying
with Federal requirements for your Board meetings?
Mr. Coscia. Well, without adding to the sort of need to
analyze it from a legal standpoint, which Mr. Gardner has
committed to doing, and my recollection of the application of
the Sunshine law at Amtrak is in line with what Mr. Gardner
just mentioned. But on a more important point, the Board feels
as though the level of requests for transparency as to the
Board's deliberations and the operations of the company is
actually a very, very positive thing. We embrace it. We very
much welcome the opportunity, as we now have in the last year,
to have several meetings in the public.
Our meeting in Richmond was very well-attended by the
general public. Meetings we have had with the disability
community, with our labor unions, all of them have been in the
context of a Board session, including those constituent groups.
And as I mentioned during my testimony, we are doing that with
the States beginning next month.
In addition to that, myself and several of our Board
members have made a point of engaging different stakeholder
groups that are very engaged with Amtrak on an individual level
in order to be able to hear more of their concerns.
I have had conversations within the past day with the RPA,
which you know represents the largest group of our passengers.
And we have discussed a number of initiatives that we can do
jointly to create a greater level of interaction between our
stakeholder community, our Board, and the company generally.
And the RPA can certainly speak for themselves, but I think
they are very supportive of that effort.
Mr. Nehls. I would like to hear from Ms. White on this from
a State's perspective about just being more open, transparent,
Amtrak's decisionmaking.
Ms. White. We were appreciative of being included in the
Board meeting in Richmond in December and appreciated the
opportunity to share our story there. Transparency is
foundational in the State of North Carolina. So, we support
what Amtrak is doing to become more transparent.
Mr. Nehls. Yes. Last one for Mr. Gardner here. In 2016,
Amtrak awarded the $2.45 billion Federal loan to procure these
trainsets for the Acela, which was last month, by the way, so,
I helped contribute to your record month, right? May 2024, the
most revenue. Is that what it was? Well, I am part of that.
However, to date, these trainsets are still not in service.
According to reports from Amtrak OIG, these trainsets were
produced by manufacturers before they could verify that they
were safe to run on the Northeast Corridor.
So, I don't know why Amtrak agrees to build trainsets
before getting the safety model validated and approved by the
FRA. I think you kind of mentioned it in your opening, but when
can we expect the new Acela trainsets to enter into service?
Mr. Gardner. Well, thank you, Chairman Nehls. So, you are
right that we have been working with Alstom, the manufacturer,
for quite a while here on these trains, and they are in test
right now. Our hope is that by the end of the year, they could
be in service around that period. That will depend on the
testing work.
But I would say that when we went out to bid for these
trains, there, of course, was not a domestic high-speed rail
industry here at the time. We had a competitive procurement,
and we went through a brandnew regulatory process established
by the FRA, which had required trains to be built, prototype
trains to be built, and then additional trains to be made, and
then tested both in dynamic tests and using simulation of
models.
So, that is underway and is following all the requirements
of the FRA. It is really Alstom's job to finish this testing
and get the train certified. We are anxious, of course, to have
that happen, because as you say, the ridership is going well.
And we wish we had more trains available today. We are working
hard to make that happen----
Mr. Nehls [interposing]. Very good.
Mr. Gardner [continuing]. And hold our partners accountable
in the process.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you.
I yield back.
I now recognize Ms. Wilson for 5 minutes.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
This is for Ms. White. The American Association of State
Highway and Transportation Officials and the States for
Passenger Rail Coalition recently sent a joint letter to our
Appropriations colleagues in support of the President's
recommendation to set aside funds from the CRISI Program for
State rail planning efforts since there is no dedicated Federal
funding source for rail planning.
Ms. White, do you support this effort?
Ms. White. Thank you for the question. Yes, we are members
of AASHTO, and we do support the position.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask
for unanimous consent to add that letter to the record.
Mr. Nehls. Without objection.
[The information follows:]

Letter of June 10, 2024, to the Senate Committee on Appropriations and
House Committee on Appropriations, from Jim Tymon, Executive Director,
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, and
Jeremy Latimer, Chair, States for Passenger Rail Coalition, Submitted
for the Record by Hon. Frederica S. Wilson
June 10, 2024.
The Honorable Patty Murray,
Chair,
Senate Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate Committee,
Washington, DC 20510.
The Honorable Susan Collins,
Vice Chair,
Senate Committee on Appropriations, United States Senate, Washington,
DC 20510.
The Honorable Tom Cole,
Chair,
House Committee on Appropriations, United States House of
Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Rosa DeLauro,
Ranking Member,
House Committee on Appropriations, United States House of
Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chair Murray, Vice Chair Collins, Chair Cole, and Ranking
Member DeLauro:
As you begin your work to develop appropriations legislation for
Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25), we request Congress direct $20 million in
CRISI funds to states using an equitable approach that benefits all
states to support planning and project delivery efforts.
Thanks to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) as well
as your work on annual appropriations, a new era of federal investment
in our nation's rail system is now underway. States are stepping up to
plan new routes and manage the complex infrastructure projects required
to turn visions and plans into reality. In addition, states are hard at
work on new workforce development and training initiatives to meet the
challenge of ambitious project delivery.
The American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials (AASHTO) and the States for Passenger Rail Coalition (SPRC)
are at the forefront of implementing federal policy and funding for
rail. We are also among the organizations most directly impacted by
capacity constraints in delivering rail infrastructure projects. While
the welcome influx of federal investment has mobilized planning and
preparation for new rail projects, the unpredictable and uncertain
nature of discretionary grant awards does not naturally lead to the
steady, intentional capacity building necessary at the state level to
manage and deliver rail projects and service.
President's Budget Request for FY25 recognizes this need, and we
strongly support its enactment in the upcoming appropriations bill to
enhance state capacity to plan and manage new rail projects. This
funding set-aside will provide every single state with a crucial
complement to the federal investments in rail already underway and in
the pipeline. Resources to bolster states' capacity will enable federal
investments in rail infrastructure to be deployed faster and more
efficiently.
We look forward to working with you in the coming year to advance
this exciting new chapter for rail in America, and we appreciate your
consideration of this request.
Sincerely,
Jim Tymon,
Executive Director,
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.
Jeremy Latimer,
Chair, States for Passenger Rail Coalition,
Virginia Passenger Rail Authority,
919 E. Main Street, Suite 2400, Richmond, VA 23219.

Ms. Wilson of Florida. Ms. White, what is North Carolina
doing to reduce grade crossing incidents between cars and
pedestrians with passenger and freight trains?
Ms. White. Our rail division has responsibility for safety
as part of our portfolio, so, we have a number of programs
aimed at reducing vehicle and train and pedestrian conflicts.
Our S-Line corridor that we are developing from Raleigh north
is actually going to be a sealed corridor. It is a concept that
we pioneered some years ago where the entire corridor will be
grade separated. And so, that is one example of what we are
doing.
We have an active program to close grade crossings
throughout the State, and we help fund those programs as well.
We have a BeRailSafe program where we do education to try and
encourage people not to trespass and be where the tracks are.
So, we have a very active safety portfolio in our rail
division.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. OK. Thank you.
This is for Mr. Gardner. Mr. Gardner, what can you tell me
about when Amtrak will be able to serve the Miami Intermodal
Center at Miami Airport?
Mr. Gardner. Thank you, Congresswoman. The Miami Intermodal
Center at the airport has been a project long underway, and it
involves us transitioning from our Hialeah facility to that
facility. We are in active conversations with FDOT and also the
Miami-Dade Airport Authority and Tri-Rail, who are responsible
for both the infrastructure and the station. We have been in
negotiations for a while to try and establish the right terms
of access. Amtrak has access as a matter of statute to the
facility. So, we are in negotiations presently with FDOT to try
and come up with a deal that works for all parties here and
allows Amtrak to move over so we can terminate our trains at
that facility.
It is important that we have an efficient facility there
that can continue to serve passengers well. We think the
connections intermodally are great. But we remain in
negotiations with FDOT so we can get the right deal for Amtrak
in terms of its tenancy.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you.
Ms. White, North Carolina received one of the Federal-State
Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Grant for the Raleigh-
Richmond corridor. Why did you choose this corridor to submit
to the program?
Ms. White. Congresswoman, I want to be sure I understood
the question. Did you say the submission for the Federal-State
partnership grant or for the Corridor ID Program?
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Yes.
Ms. White Federal-State partnership grant?
When the competitive grant opportunities open up, we
analyze them as compared to the projects that we have in our
pipeline to determine which we think will be the most
competitive and which we have a match for.
For the S-Line, we use grade separations in our State
Transportation Improvement Program as matched to the Federal
funds. So, we had a number of those grade separations already
programmed in our State Transportation Improvement Program.
Additionally, we felt with the benefit-cost analysis that it
would be a highly competitive project. We are doing it in
partnership with the State of Virginia and with Amtrak, and we
know that advancing projects in the Southeast Corridor is
important to the Federal Railroad Administration. So, we felt
it would be a highly competitive project.
Additionally, we have an incredible amount of groundswell
of support from the communities along the S-Line. When we first
started thinking about bringing passenger rail back to the S-
Line, we went and met with each community along the line and
asked them if that was something that would interest them. It
runs through the main street of many towns in the Triangle
area. And each of them had said that that was a goal for their
community to bring passenger rail back. So, that was part of
our process in determining that that was our best project to
put forward.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentlelady yields.
I now recognize the ranking member of the full committee,
Mr. Larsen, for 5 minutes. Go ahead.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I
appreciate that.
First question is really for Mr. Coscia, and
congratulations on your recent reconfirmation. I have heard
some concerns that Amtrak's Board is overly focused on the
Northeast Corridor--apologies for my friends in the Northeast
Corridor--at the expense of the national network.
Can you characterize Amtrak Board's view on long-distance
trains and getting a long-distance network?
Mr. Coscia. Thank you. Thank you, Ranking Member, for that
question.
And I actually welcome the opportunity to speak about this,
which I often do, because given the fact that I am actually
from the Northeast Corridor and have had a career there that
there is an assumption made about my position on the subject,
as well as several of my fellow Board members. And I think I
can say--I would like to say without any equivocation
whatsoever, that I and our Board are very, very much committed
to the national network. And, in fact, we have made many
decisions during the course of our Board's work together to
make significant investments in acquiring additional equipment
and upgrading state of good repair. And we have recently, as I
think was mentioned, issued an RFP to completely replace the
fleet on the long-distance corridor.
But I think far more fundamental to it is that our view and
our hope for Amtrak's future is to build a national network
that uses our existing long-distance system as essentially the
spine upon which we build that. We see that as the anchor that
gives us the ability to serve many communities throughout the
country that don't have service today.
And we also are very much aware of the fact that the
communities that we serve in the national network, in many
respects, we are their only form of transportation. There isn't
an airport that can be easily utilized. The bus systems have
abandoned them a long time ago. And many of our travelers don't
have access to an automobile as well. So, we know that, from an
economic driver standpoint and from a mobility standpoint, our
work in those communities is absolutely fundamental.
So, we are, as a Board, 100 percent committed to the
maintenance of our national network and, frankly, the expansion
of it. And I think we have put our resources behind that kind
of initiative and expect to continue to do so.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you.
Deputy Secretary White, what lessons can other States take
from your work to develop support for passenger rail? Do you
have a top three for us to consider?
Ms. White. Top three. Well, let's start with that local
community support. We really start with an approach of a
partnership. If it is not a goal of a community, and they
aren't willing to do a match, then we are going to work with
different communities.
Get in the game I would say is number two. All of these
grant opportunities to bring passenger rail require a match.
And so, we like communities that are willing to take a tough
vote and put their budget behind the project.
And then I would say the third key success for us is the
NCDOT's expertise. Applying for and administering Federal funds
is an incredibly complex thing to do, and small and midsized
towns do not have the staff to be able to do that. And so, I
think what we are most proud of is the partnership that we have
created with these communities where we bring that expertise,
we ensure they stay between the guardrails, but they decide
what that investment looks like in their community.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thanks.
Mr. Gardner, with apologies for the pun, to keep this
engine running for Amtrak, as well as for State-supported
systems, can you talk--can you help us understand how the FRA's
Corridor ID grants are meshing with Amtrak's investments, both
State-supported as well as Amtrak directly?
Mr. Gardner. Yes. Thank you, Ranking Member Larsen. The
Corridor ID Program by FRA is really the pipeline of
development for expansion, the type of expansion that Deputy
Secretary White mentioned is planned to happen in North
Carolina, that our Chairman just mentioned. It is really the
pathway, similar to the FTA Capital Investment Grant Program, a
New Start that establishes, with the guidance of the Federal
Government, the development of this network. And Amtrak's role
in that is to be a partner to FRA and a partner to States like
North Carolina who are looking at options and ideas and
opportunities for passenger rail.
I take your point, Chairman Nehls, that we need to, of
course, take care of the network we have. But we are responding
to the overwhelming interest across America to see more
passenger trains in different communities. And so, we are
trying to support that, while also driving our business and
improving in all the dimensions that we can.
I think our investments are really in two common--in sort
of two buckets. One is this IIJA supplemental fund that is
really letting us bring all of our old assets sort of out of
the 20th century and drag them into the 21st. And then this
annual appropriations that you mentioned is so key to keeping
our current services going and allowing us to partner with
States for modernization. Because the IIJA funds that come to
Amtrak aren't for expansion, they aren't to grow capacity, they
are really to rebuild that old, sort of core asset base.
So, we need those annual funds, and we need the funds that
the FRA is providing to our State partners and others to keep
developing this network and look for the opportunities,
recognizing that some opportunities are nearer and some are in
the distance. But passenger rail can play a much bigger role in
mobility in the United States, and we think it must.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you.
Thanks, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. The gentleman yields.
I now recognize Mr. Rouzer for 5 minutes.
Mr. Rouzer. I thank the chairman.
Now, Ms. White, I am going to start with you. Thank you so
much for being here, and I appreciate the work that you do for
North Carolina.
So, in your role, you oversee the rail division, as well as
the aviation and ferry divisions. And I want to take the
opportunity to talk to you a little bit about the ferry system,
which is the second largest in the country.
Are there things that Congress can do in terms of reforms
to Federal programs, such as the Rural Ferry Program, that
would be a benefit?
Ms. White. Thank you, Congressman, so much for the
question. I love talking about ferries at the Railroad
Subcommittee.
We do run----
Mr. Rouzer [interrupting]. I am chairman of Water
Resources, so, I have a little leeway here.
Ms. White [continuing]. We do run our own transit system.
We do run in North Carolina a ferry system serving eastern
North Carolina. It is a $74-million-a-year operation with 23
vessels and 8 routes, including a seasonal one. And so, we are
incredibly proud of running that system.
And thank you for the support that Congress did in creating
the Rural Ferry Capital Program. It is a $20-million-a-year
competitive grant program. We are very grateful to be able to
compete for that fund. It is incredibly oversubscribed. To
build a vessel costs us, depending on the type of vessel,
anywhere from $30 million to $50 million. So, competing in a
$20 million pot is incredibly difficult.
So, we would very much appreciate consideration of
additional resources to the Rural Ferry Capital Program. Also,
there are some mileage requirements on what allows you to
compete in the bigger pot of money that could be considered,
maybe expand it, to allow more ferry systems to compete within
them.
Thank you so much for the question.
Mr. Rouzer. And talk just a little bit about how the ferry
system is so critical during hurricanes and other natural
disasters like we often have in North Carolina?
Ms. White. That is so true. Thinking back to Hurricane
Dorian, the ferry division evacuated nearly 1,500 people and
over 750 vehicles from Ocracoke Island during the Hurricane
Dorian lead-in to the storm. And then after the storm, we were
the first responders bringing over the necessary assistance to
rebuild, the dump trucks hauling off the trash, we would bring
the gas, we would bring the water. So, it was a many months'
long effort of our team coordinating with Hyde County to do
disaster response after Hurricane Dorian.
We, unfortunately, are seeing more and more substantial
weather at our coast. We now have on Highway 12 what we call
sunny day storms. We will have complete water overwash on a
sunny day on Highway 12. So, we are very much a critical
lifeline to the island, to our poorest county in the State,
which needs to pull in its tax revenues in the summer to
support the county yearlong.
Mr. Rouzer. Thank you much.
Mr. Gardner, now back to rail. And I don't mean this as an
antagonistic question whatsoever, so, don't take it that way.
But has Amtrak ever turned a profit in a year?
Mr. Gardner. No, sir.
Mr. Rouzer. I think that is why the issue of bonuses and
incentive pay is so touchy, and particularly given the dollar
amount.
So, what are the prospects, what is the timeline where you
think we can get to a point where we can turn a profit?
Mr. Gardner. Well, Congressman, I think, first off, the
sort of yardstick for measuring Amtrak and our performance as
set forth in statute--it is really a balance of both financial
performance and efficiency----
Mr. Rouzer [interrupting]. I got that. I got that.
Mr. Gardner. So, we are trying to do both those things.
Before the pandemic, we were essentially about to be at break
even. We lost all our business. We are working back to get
there. Now, our goal is, in the next several years, on the
train operating side of the business, so, sort of same story as
to prepandemic, we would expect to break even towards the end
of this decade. And we are working hard to achieve that.
We are facing many significantly expanded costs. So, while
our revenues are back and above prepandemic level, our cost
structure is about 30 to 40 percent higher, depending on the
area. So, we are working hard there. But we are growing
revenue. We are going to reduce losses this year. We will keep
reducing losses every year and work back towards getting as
efficient as we can while driving as much value and service to
the American people.
Mr. Rouzer. In my last 40 seconds here, you recently
testified regarding Amtrak's desire to purchase and manage
Union Station. You indicated your plan was to transform the
station from the current mixed-use retail, restaurant, and
transit hub to a sole purpose passenger holding center.
One thing I am a little concerned about here, we have a
homeless issue there now. You take all those stores out, you
take the mixed use out. Number one, where are getting the
funding to do all this? And are you concerned that it is just
going to be a much greater magnet for the homeless? It is a
beautiful building.
Mr. Gardner. Absolutely. A beautiful building, Congressman.
Our intention actually is to enhance and maintain the retail,
but better amenities. As you know, right now, it is about half
empty because of all the folks that have left during that
period. Amtrak doesn't have possession of the building yet. But
our goal is, in fact, to do what you just described, create a
lively mixed-use environment which supports all the
transportation users.
The big issue is that Amtrak was sort of sequestered in the
back. We have more than doubled the ridership since we had this
little leasehold in the back of the station. The main part of
the building wasn't used for passenger transportation, even
though we have MARC service and VRE service and WMATA.
So, we are just talking about using more of the building to
serve the needs of the passengers, while also creating a great
community amenity and a place that millions of people come to
visit every year from all over the United States when they come
to visit this building and Washington.
So, we believe very much in a successful venture that will
drive both commercial revenue so we can reinvest in the
facility, and also the kind of amenities that people want in
our train stations. So, they want the bookstores, they want to
be able to go to a cafe, they want a restaurant. And we want to
serve the neighborhood well.
Mr. Rouzer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time has expired.
Mr. Nehls. All right. Thank you.
And I now recognize Mr. Moulton for 5 minutes.
Mr. Moulton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I would like to pick up where my colleague, Mr. Rouzer,
left off about Amtrak profitability. It is also how you opened
your remarks, Mr. Chairman, about profitability. And I just
want to ask, why, when we have hearings on highways, do we not
open the hearings by saying why are our interstate highways not
profitable? Why have they cost the American taxpayer billions
of dollars a year to maintain billions of dollars in broader
cost to society, like the 40,000 Americans who die on our
highways every year?
And it is taxpayer dollars that clean up every one of those
messes. It is taxpayer dollars that built the highways,
hundreds of billions of dollars. Amtrak got none of that.
Taxpayer dollars didn't build our railways. And yet, we don't
have a problem with the fact that the Interstate Highway System
doesn't make a profit.
Or why not open hearings on airlines by saying, how much
would our airlines make in profits if they had to pay for
security, if they had to pay for air traffic control? They
barely squeeze a profit as it is. In fact, the United States
taxpayer has bailed out our airlines multiple times in the last
20 years to the tunes of tens of billions of dollars. And we
don't ask them how they could be profitable if they didn't have
subsidies.
So, there is a huge double standard here. And the fact that
Mr. Gardner can even talk about approaching profitability,
something that we wouldn't even discuss with our highways, is
pretty remarkable, and it points to the innate efficiency of
rail.
Now, to emphasize my bipartisan credentials here, I also
have a little critique of what the ranking member said. Because
when she brought up grade crossing accidents, we talked about
how this is a problem for the railroads and this is a concern
that railroads have. And Ms. White talked about how the rail
division is responsible for grade crossing accidents in North
Carolina.
Let's be clear, every one of these accidents is a highway
traveler breaking the law, with very, very, very, very few
exceptions, with malfunctioning equipment. This is lawbreakers
getting killed by trains, delaying train passage. I wish we
could have a discussion about how we reduce the delays to rail
passengers every time there is one of these accidents. That is
what we should be talking about. And we should be talking about
how we use highway funds to address accidents caused by highway
travelers, not just pin this blame on the railroads.
Now, Ms. White, I want to turn to you for a second to talk
about your plans in North Carolina. You mentioned the goal of
service from Wilmington to Asheville, a distance of 330 miles,
currently a 5-hour and 45-minute drive. That is made possible,
of course--it would be a much longer drive--but it is made
possible by State and Federal dollars that went into building
those highways. What travel time would you expect for this
corridor?
Ms. White. Thank you for the question. Each of those
corridors has been admitted into the Corridor ID Program, so,
we are really----
Mr. Moulton [interrupting]. I am just asking a simple
question. What travel time do you expect?
Ms. White. I don't have that answer at this time.
Mr. Moulton. Well, any other developed country in the world
would do that in about 2 hours and 20 minutes, or under 2 hours
for express service, because they would invest in true high-
speed rail. I mean, Morocco is investing in true high-speed
rail.
Your much touted S-Line will go 110 miles per hour, the
same speed as trains in the 1920s, and exactly half the speed
of new lines in Europe, less than half the speed of new lines
in China.
Is North Carolina planning to build any new State or
Federal highways with a top speed of 35 miles per hour, half
the speed of current highways?
Ms. White. We are not.
Mr. Moulton. OK. Are you planning to build any new
international airports that only accept prop planes, the
technology that was taking off in the 1920s when we had a 110-
mile-per-hour trains in America?
[No response.]
Mr. Moulton. I assume the answer is no.
Ms. White. We are not.
Mr. Moulton. You said the trip from Washington, DC, to
Raleigh will be car-competitive. I guess that is 4 hours 30
minutes to 5 hours. Again, just to put this in perspective, any
other developed country in the world would make that an hour
and 45 minutes, express trains in an hour and a half. That
would be transformative. That would actually get a lot of
people out of our airports and off our highways. That is what
our goal should be.
I mean, my point to you is that, as you are building this,
please look at what the rest of the world is doing. Look at the
model of the TGV in France, where any new corridors they build
are built to modern high-speed rail standards.
Now, you have that opportunity because some of the S-Line
was abandoned, and so, you are building a new corridor. The
parts that are already existing--sometimes TGV trains slow down
to go slower on those segments. But do not, please do not
invest good taxpayer money into technology appropriate for the
1920s instead of the 2020s.
Mr. Chairman, I believe that even you would be a great
Amtrak passenger rail supporter if we invested in modern high-
speed rail and not trains that we had 100 years ago.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr.
LaMalfa for 5 minutes.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
In my home State of California--I will direct this to Mr.
Gardner--our high-speed rail project went from a projected
ballot item that told the taxpayers it would be a $33 billion
project to go from S.F. to L.A. and be completed by the year
2020. And a good portion of that above the $9 billion bond
portion that the voters voted on--the rest would be from
private investments, attracting private investments.
So, so far, the private investors just stayed away in
droves; the $9 billion has been burned up; and the projected
cost is, instead of $33 billion, is at least $128 billion; and
there hasn't been a mile of actual track laid yet other than
some of the roadbed that has been put down and some of the
bridges.
They also at the time claimed that there would be 1 million
jobs up until a couple years after the ballot measure, then
they finally had to admit 1 million job-years, which at the
present number they tout of 13,000 workers, the math I did
would see--if you have 1 million job-years divided by 13,000
workers, that will take 76 years to build the project, which
they are right on track for that at this point here. So, this
would be at least 2030-something before they get one of these
segments done.
So, Mr. Gardner, how could they be so far off on an initial
business plan that they told the voters, the taxpayers, in 2008
to what we have now, where there is nowhere near $128 billion?
They might be able to put their hands on $20 billion when they
do carbon taxing, and they just filched another $3 billion out
of the Federal Government here recently.
So, when they are $100 billion short, where are they going
to get that, and how could they be so far off on the plan? They
didn't even have the route figured out before they put this in
front of the voters.
Mr. Gardner. Well, Congressman, certainly Amtrak, as you
know, has not been involved in the high-speed project----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. No. But you did----
Mr. Gardner [continuing]. Technically or its original
development.
Mr. LaMalfa [continuing]. Were supportive in your comments.
Mr. Gardner. We are supportive of advancing high-speed, and
similar to Congressman Moulton's point, we think there is a
real role for high-speed in various markets of the United
States. And California certainly has incredible markets and
huge demand and real challenges in terms of mobility.
But I think the main issue and something we have learned
and an issue that has also faced Amtrak is that, quite often,
because there hasn't been the apparatus to fund or develop
early planning phases for good ideas, when folks are trying to,
sort of, develop concepts for these systems, which, I think,
could create a lot of value, they are doing so before we have
gone through the standard preliminary engineering, design, NEPA
processes that really do set the envelope of cost and schedule.
And so----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. What did you just say for the
last 40 seconds there? What did you just actually say right
then?
Mr. Gardner. That one of the challenges when doing big
projects is the amount of planning and the time for planning to
get the project developed.
And so, what happened in California is really, I think, the
California high-speed team could explain the process, but I
would say that, for any project to really--a big project to be
something that folks can understand the terms of estimating
cost and time, you have got to go through this environmental
process. And the environmental process and the planning process
are really what set out the possible envelope.
So, you asked me what happened from their initial estimates
to now----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Just looking for an idea----
Mr. Gardner [continuing]. Is that process.
Mr. LaMalfa [continuing]. How a plan could be that far off,
and we have bigger plans going forward.
Let me talk a more local one. Dunsmuir, California, up in
my district, used to have a twice-a-day connection there.
During the pandemic, as they call it, was all halted. So, now
there is only one a day. You have to catch it around somewhere
between 1 a.m. or 4 a.m., depending.
So, the local economy--and this is just one typical rural
town. The rural areas are some of the least utilized service
routes, and they have much more interruptions.
So, with Amtrak setting forward to do very optimistic work,
how are we going to see that the rural areas are going to have
any share of this that is going to be significant instead of
being the tail end of the whole system?
Mr. Gardner. Well, Congressman, we have got our Coast
Starlight service serving Dunsmuir and the other several stops
in your district. And there is also supplemental bus service
that serves some of the stations, Chico and I think up to
Redding as well, that is funded by the State of California in
partnership with Amtrak, the connecting bus service.
So, I think maybe the change in service is the bus service
levels. But we believe, as you heard from our Chairman, in
investing in this national network. Right now, the big changes
that are happening are new fleet coming to better serve
communities like Dunsmuir and investments across all of the
stations so that we have accessible stations and also stations
that are----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. OK. Thank you. I have to cut
you off there due to time.
But a new fleet isn't going to change the fact that there
are no trains running through there and that we don't have the
model be successful out there with passenger rail. It seems
freight has to somehow keep railroads in business.
So, with that, I am way too--thank you, Mr. Chairman. I
will yield back.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. I now recognize Ms. Foushee for 5
minutes.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Deputy Secretary
White, as I am sure you are aware, Siemens Mobility recently
announced a new plant in Lexington, North Carolina, to
manufacture and maintain trainsets.
From your perspective at NCDOT, what will the impact of
this new facility be for our State, and how has the guaranteed
passenger rail funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
influenced or leveraged business investment in our State?
Ms. White. Thank you for the question. So, Siemens Mobility
broke ground on their new plant in August of 2023. It will be a
$220 million facility in Lexington, North Carolina, that will
create more than 500 jobs by 2028 and is estimated to grow the
State's economy by $1.6 billion over the next 12 years.
They sought to build a large-scale manufacturing facility
on the east coast because of all of the orders for new
intercity passenger railcars. We are very excited for the State
of North Carolina to see the supply chain that will grow around
that investment, bringing even further jobs and opportunity to
North Carolina.
And we are excited to see those trains roll out of North
Carolina-made plant up and down the eastern seaboard, including
when our new trains arrive in North Carolina. Thank you.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you for that. And, thanks to the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, North Carolina received seven
Corridor ID grant awards last year.
How do you anticipate this funding improving North
Carolina's ability to invest in and accelerate the development
of passenger rail in our State?
Ms. White. So, Corridor ID is really important because a
community needs--as Stephen had said, the community needs to
understand what is the project going to cost. The Corridor ID's
first step initially unlocks $500,000 worth of planning funds
so that we can start to work with communities to define what
the service outcomes are that they would like to see and what
the infrastructure investments will be that are needed to make
that happen.
So, with each of our communities that have been admitted
into the Corridor ID Program, we are now meeting with them to
understand what are the kind of service outcomes that they
would like to see; what is the match that they will need at
what time in this process?
I would give as an example, when we were meeting with the
community of Fayetteville recently, they are very excited to
have their corridor admitted into the program. They see a
connection between Fayetteville and Raleigh as really important
to their military community.
They don't get direct flights out of Fayetteville to DC,
which is a common path of travel. They lost their direct flight
some years ago. And so, they see this as an opportunity to do a
ticket on a train from Fayetteville to Raleigh, and then they
can go from RDU to DC as a solution for them. When we build out
the S-Line, they are more excited that they can stay on that
single-seat train and go from Fayetteville right to DC.
But what we are doing with them is saying, ``We will do
this first phase of initial planning with you, and then we can
tell you when you will need your 10-percent match for the next
phase of planning and how much that will be,'' so they can put
it into their local government budget cycle.
And then we can say, ``When you get to the construction
stage, that will be 80 percent Federal funds and 20 percent
non-Federal funds, and this is how much that will be and when
you will need it.''
It's that kind of structured planning that will tell a
community what has to be built, how much it will cost, and what
the timetable is to when they will need that funding.
So, we are doing that with the Wilmingtons, the Ashevilles,
the Goldsboros, the Fayettevilles all across our State. And
that kind of robust planning, I think, will help us be able to
deliver more projects on time and on budget.
I will have to brag a little bit on our rail division in
North Carolina. During the earlier era investments, the State
of North Carolina won a $500 million investment to improve the
corridor between Greensboro and Charlotte. It was a $1\1/2\
billion investment, and we delivered it on time and on budget.
We delivered it $3 under the grant that was given to us. We
attempted to spend the last $3, but could not find a way to do
that within the rules.
So, we feel really confident that, when we take these
corridors through Corridor ID, we will be able to help deliver
those projects.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you. And, finally, can you speak a
little about the ways in which North Carolina's Department of
Transportation works both with Amtrak and local communities to
ensure that train service will benefit our communities back
home?
Ms. White. It is really important for us to listen to the
communities and understand the service outcomes that they need.
We are starting to explore a sixth frequency between Charlotte
and Raleigh.
And so, our first step will be to go to the communities
along our main corridor between Raleigh and Charlotte and
understand, how do they use our train, how would they like to
use our train. We have folks who commute between cities for
their jobs. We have folks who use it to get to healthcare. We
have folks that use it to get to college. Our main corridor
touches about 22 colleges.
So, understanding what times of day they travel and how
they want to use it will be a first step in ensuring that it
meets their traveling needs. Then we will work with our freight
railroad partners, with the North Carolina Railroad and with
Amtrak to figure out what kind of infrastructure investments
are needed to create that kind of capacity to unlock that
additional frequency along the corridor.
So, for us, it is really about the partnership with our
partners. And North Carolina, we approach rail projects--
because we run on freight rail tracks--we approach it as how do
we create a win-win. How do we create the ability for freight
to not only continue to run its freight but to grow its freight
opportunity, because manufacturing is a key part of our economy
in North Carolina, while also building the additional capacity
to add more passenger rail.
We really take, I think, a partnership approach to what we
do.
Mrs. Foushee. Thanks for that. Mr. Chairman, that is my
time. I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Babin for 5
minutes.
Dr. Babin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you,
witnesses, for being here today. My questions are for you, Mr.
Gardner.
California just petitioned the EPA to allow it to implement
the so-called in-use locomotive regulation, which would
effectively require all locomotives, including passenger rail,
to operate in a zero-emission configuration when operating in
the State of California.
Does Amtrak have a position on this matter? And, if so, why
did Amtrak choose not to submit comments?
Mr. Gardner. Thank you, Congressman. My understanding is
that the proposal won't create an issue for Amtrak and our
current fleet and our trajectory over time to achieve net zero
by 2045. So, we are working with the State, and we support,
ultimately, the transition here where it is appropriate.
And so, we have been working with California. Of course,
obviously, maintaining service is going to be critical to us,
but that is our position so far.
Dr. Babin. All other railroads, large and small, have
conducted extensive analysis to determine the impact of this
regulation on their businesses and on their customers.
What sort of analysis has Amtrak performed, if any at all,
and what are the results of Amtrak's analysis?
And, if EPA approves the California regulation, it may well
be implemented in other States as well. So, what sort of impact
would this regulation have on Amtrak's business?
Mr. Gardner. Again, I think at the moment, we don't
anticipate there being a significant impact to our service in
California, but I can follow up with you with any of the
specifics based on our analysis.
Dr. Babin. OK. Great. Amtrak recently projected $1 billion
in annual losses through 2027. Some of it has already been
discussed. Much of this has been related to COVID-era impacts.
But, as we all know, COVID hysteria has been over for a while
now.
For Amtrak, ridership has nearly recovered to pre-pandemic
levels. So, why is Amtrak still going to lose so much money
over the next few years, and how is COVID actually still
impacting Amtrak's business model?
Mr. Gardner. Thank you, Congressman. We have significantly
reduced our losses year over year. Last year, our loss was $752
million, which was $120 million better than the prior year.
This year, we will be somewhere around $670 million. So, we are
continuing to improve. And, as I mentioned to the chairman, get
better and better financials here every year.
The big issue that is facing Amtrak in terms of cost
structure--because you mentioned, our revenue is back, our
ridership is back. What is significantly higher is our costs,
and those have come in, really, a couple of different forms.
First, our labor costs are significantly up. As you know,
the freight railroad started to pattern bargain with their
unions, and we followed through, are almost done with our
agreements. We have really great relationships with our unions,
and I think we have got really good deals. But these costs are
going up, and they reflect the larger wage, sort of, increases
across the economy.
For us to be competitive, we have got to pay competitive
wages. So, those labor costs are up, fuel costs are up,
insurance is significantly higher, claims-related expense also
up significantly. So, a lot of headwinds.
That is all before you get to the supply chain. So, all of
the costs, of course, associated with the hard materials we
purchase have all increased. So, we are fighting that
inflation, but we are clawing back, sort of, year by year here
with better revenue and more service against the strong demand.
Dr. Babin. Well, Amtrak claims to be a private company. But
a private company, any one that I know of, could not keep its
head above water when it is bleeding billions of dollars of
that nature, and would a private company likely consider
handing out bonuses ranging from a half a million dollars to
$750,000 if their company were performing like that? I think
not.
So, Mr. Gardner, how do you justify handing out so much
money to your executives if they are failing to get Amtrak into
the green, or the black, I should say? Does performance have
anything to do with bonus decisions, or are the numbers decided
on arbitrarily?
And, if there is some sort of calculation or metric that
determines these bonuses, I would appreciate you sharing that
with the committee today because we are very interested, or at
least following up with my office to share that.
Mr. Gardner. Yes. Absolutely. I would be happy to share
that with you. And, as the Chairman said, we will be publishing
this information. We do provide these numbers to Congress, and
we have been able to talk through the way it works.
To go to your first point, Amtrak is a federally owned
corporation chartered here in DC under the Corporate Act. So,
certainly, we don't consider ourselves a purely private
corporation. We, obviously, are owned by the Government and
responsive to the taxpayer, and we have a Board that is
appointed by the President.
So, we have a dual mission, really, to both serve the
Nation and to do so efficiently and be good stewards of the
public's resources and try and generate as much as we can to
cover this network from the users of the system. So, we work
hard to do that, and we will continue to work hard to do that.
In terms of the network itself, it is set, really, by
Congress. So, to the extent that the network produces some
services that require subsidy, like transit all over the United
States, then that is because Congress has asked us to run those
services, and we believe that they produce value. So, we are
supportive of that.
In terms of the incentives, we have to compete with folks
who have stock options, who get many times the value in
incentives in the freight railroads and others. And we need to
bring the best folks who can come manage a multibillion-dollar
program here in Amtrak in the United States. And so, we are out
there competing to try and get that value.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you, sir. I now recognize Mr. Deluzio for
5 minutes.
Mr. Deluzio. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And good afternoon,
folks. Glad to be here with you. I will just note and associate
myself with many of Mr. Moulton's good comments about this
profitability question. I suspect we would have a very
different discussion here if we were talking about the massive
subsidies that we provide for other forms of transportation
that are not provided in a meaningful way to Amtrak and
passenger rail and the strong need for substantial Federal
investment, I think, in faster high-speed rail.
With that, I recently rode the Capitol Limited from
Pittsburgh down here to Washington. Beautiful ride. Takes you
through really lovely parts of Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Maryland before you get to Washington, 7\1/2\ hours or so. You
do that by 4\1/2\ hours by car; I think the scheduled flight
time is a little more than an hour; it's less than that.
I say that, again, recognizing that we need to have
substantial investment in high-speed rail. Until that happens--
which it should--this could also be faster.
In 1941, my team found out it took about 6 hours 40 minutes
to do that trip. And we know the main problem is not just the
topography, which causes some issues. Freight traffic. Freight
rail slows down a lot of what happens on that route and many
others.
The Host Railroad Report says freight train interference is
among the top two largest reasons for delay for the two freight
railroads that are there, Norfolk Southern and CSX. Passenger
rail has legal preference over freight on the tracks. But DOJ,
as I understand it, has sued a carrier one time, 1979. If I am
wrong, you will correct me there.
So, Mr. Gardner, my question: Does Amtrak have the tools
that you think are necessary to reduce freight train
interference that causes delays on routes like the Capitol
Limited?
Mr. Gardner. Well, thank you, Congressman, for that
question. Let me first start by saying that each route is
different. There is always a combination of both the
infrastructure and the geography and other things.
We always are looking to have trip-time competitive
service. That is actually Congress' instructions to us in our
mission and one of the things that we are driving. Because we
are similarly frustrated that we can't connect Washington and
Pittsburgh and other parts of Pennsylvania in a way that is
competitive to auto.
As you say, it used to be some of these routes were faster,
and a lot of that comes from really two things. One is the
change in the infrastructure configuration. So, sometimes
railroads that were once two tracks have now gone to one, and
there is less capacity, and it makes them--trains meeting each
other pose opportunities for delay.
Now, the second issue is preference, as you mentioned,
which is, is Amtrak and the passenger service getting the
preference it is accorded? If the infrastructure is made
smaller than those kind of conflicts come up more often, and
there is the opportunity for Amtrak to not get the preference
it necessarily needs.
Now, that is not always the case, but we do have an issue
across the United States where Amtrak does not always receive
the preference it is really--that it is entitled to under law,
and we don't have an effective enforcement regime presently.
So, this is a major issue, and one in which we think more focus
on will produce better results and in a way that does not
interfere with freight traffic.
Because, frankly, we have a train a day on this route, so,
it is a tiny impact----
Mr. Deluzio [interrupting]. Look, we have to move things
via freight rail for a lot of reasons.
Mr. Gardner. Exactly.
Mr. Deluzio. I agree. And I will ask with a little bit of
the time left, in terms of enforcement, Congress has empowered
the Surface Transportation Board, when on-time performance
drops below 80 percent, to investigate why. The Capitol
Limited, also the Pennsylvanian coming out of Pittsburgh, are
two routes where that has been the case.
Why haven't we seen those kinds of investigations requested
from Amtrak?
Mr. Gardner. So, we did start as soon as we have the
authority to because there is a long, long lead up to that
point. We did petition the STB to initiate an investigation.
That was on our Sunset Route under section 213 of PRIIA, and
so, that is underway. Certainly, we would like to see that
investigation advance as quickly as it can.
STB needs--I think has the resources--needs to have the
resources to do that. But we support this measure to determine
what the root causes are for delays. There may be a variety of
issues, infrastructure, maintenance, et cetera. But we have
poor performance on a number of routes, and we are responsible
on behalf of American people and on your behalf to make sure we
get to the bottom of what the root is and make sure that all
the parties who are responsible are working together to get
better service for the American people and the taxpayers.
Mr. Deluzio. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. I recognize Mr. Stauber for 5
minutes.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I think we do ourselves a disservice when we operate with
rose-colored glasses on. Now, I understand that passenger rail
was well-liked by some and well-used in certain geographic
areas of our country. However, no two States are exactly alike,
and practicality must be applied judiciously when considering
future investments. Spending billions of dollars should have
certain qualifiers, like efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
I would like to read an excerpt from an op-ed piece in the
Duluth, Minnesota, News Tribune from April 2021. This comes
from John Phelan, an economist at the Center of the American
Experiment.
When reflecting if a proposed train from Duluth, Minnesota,
to Minneapolis, Minnesota, would be quicker than driving, Mr.
Phelan stated, quote: ``No. The train will take 150 minutes. At
present, you can drive from the Depot in Duluth to Target Field
in 140 minutes. And that assumes you want to go from the Depot
to Target Field. If you want to go from, say, Hermantown to the
Mall of America''--Hermantown is a city right next to Duluth--
``you have to add travel time on either end of the train
journey. There's an 18-minute drive from Hermantown to the
Depot, and then you have to park your car, and a 46-minute
light rail ride, for a total journey time of 214 minutes. The
drive is 143 minutes.''
Seventy-one minutes of savings.
And all of this doesn't account for the waiting time on
train timetables.
When any mode of transportation fails to reduce cost, time,
or ease for our constituents, and when true feasibility isn't
clear, we should really consider if this is the wisest way to
spend taxpayer dollars.
I want to just ask a couple of quick questions. Mr.
Gardner, you responded to one of Mr. Babin's questions and, in
part, you responded by Amtrak is owned by the Government, paid
for by the taxpayers. Did you say that?
Mr. Gardner. Yes, sir, along with the revenues we receive.
Mr. Stauber. And Amtrak--you believe that transparency is
important when you are making decisions and allow the public to
be a part--not a part of the decision, rather, but to
understand your decisionmaking? And I am getting at, in your
meetings, would you ever propose to make your Board meetings
public, make those transcripts public?
Mr. Gardner. So, Congressman, I think the Chairman
mentioned today our response to first fulfilling all the
requirements of the new IIJA rules for the Board and having
more engagement and more transparency, and I think the Board's
willingness to further engage and create more transparency and
visibility.
Because I think, obviously, we are excited by the
engagement of folks who want to be a part of Amtrak and
understand what we are doing and create more opportunities to
do that while also making sure the company can undertake its
business.
Mr. Stauber. So, with that being said, do you stand by your
comment that Amtrak is owned by the Government and paid for by
the taxpayers? What is your salary per year?
Mr. Gardner. It is roughly $499,000 a year, sir.
Mr. Stauber. $500,000?
Mr. Gardner. Yes.
Mr. Stauber. Half a million?
Mr. Gardner. Yes.
Mr. Stauber. What was your bonus last year?
Mr. Gardner. Between our long-term program and our short-
term program, about $620,000.
Mr. Stauber. You made about $1.1 million last year?
Mr. Gardner. Correct.
Mr. Stauber. Mr. Coscia, do you want to answer those
questions?
Mr. Coscia. Thank you, yes. And I am very sensitive to the
concerns that you and others have expressed here.
Let me just sort of answer your question, in part, by
saying that I kind of approach this from the perspective of
someone who has been on the Amtrak Board, as I mentioned, since
2010. So, I have actually seen the transformation of Amtrak
that has actually--that has accompanied a pretty significant
change in the leadership at Amtrak within the management of the
company.
Amtrak is an operating entity. It runs a business, a
business that is, to some degree, prescribed by the Congress.
Mr. Stauber. Mr. Coscia--Mr. Coscia, I have 10 seconds
left. What was your salary--what is your salary per year?
Mr. Coscia. My salary? I am unpaid. The Board has paid
Board fees for the days that we----
Mr. Stauber [interrupting]. What did you make last year?
Mr. Coscia. $18,000.
Mr. Stauber. Any bonuses?
Mr. Coscia. No.
Mr. Stauber. You are not on salary?
Mr. Coscia. No.
Mr. Stauber. OK. I yield back, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Carter for 5
minutes.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank
you to our witnesses for joining us today.
My district in southeast Louisiana has historically been a
leader in transportation. Famously, the city of New Orleans
once had a large network of streetcars and was one of the first
American cities to use electric trollies.
Today, we are home to the Port of South Louisiana, one of
the Nation's leaders in total tonnage, as well as the Port of
New Orleans, the only deepwater port served by six Class I
railroads.
However, Louisiana has fallen behind other areas of the
Nation in terms of passenger rail options. Transportation
leaders in Louisiana, like John Spain and the Southern Rail
Commission, are now planning to further connect the State by
commuter rail, including lines connecting New Orleans west to
Baton Rouge and east to Mobile, Alabama, with stops at the
communities between those cities.
Doing so will reduce our transportation emissions, increase
travel choices, create good-paying jobs, and add additional
evacuation options in the face of stronger and faster
hurricanes.
I am also proud to say that the development of these routes
both have benefited from the massive investments in the rail
infrastructure made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law.
Question for Mr. Gardner and Mr. Coscia. Last year, Amtrak
announced an agreement to restore gulf coast service between
New Orleans and Mobile, which has been out of service since
Hurricane Katrina damaged the lines in 2005. That project was
aided by roughly $178 million awarded through funding from the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which helped make this return to
service a reality.
Amtrak and Southern Rail Commission have said that service
would restart by the end of this year. Is this still a
realistic timeframe? What is the status of negotiations of the
city of Mobile and their station improvements?
Mr. Gardner. Thank you, Congressman. And, as you know, we
are very big supporters of returning service to the gulf coast,
and it has been a multiyear effort, a lot of work over the
years, and a strong partnership with the Southern Rail
Commission. And we are hopefully very soon concluding our work
with the city of Mobile.
They need to work with us on a property agreement and to
allow us to undertake station--a lot of the station work--CSX
to undertake station work there in Mobile and then support
their contribution to the grant funds.
So, we are trying to finalize that with them, working hard.
And I believe they are also working with other folks in
Alabama.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Is the end of the year still a
realistic goal?
Mr. Gardner. I think we will have to see if this work can
be concluded here in the next month or so in terms of these
agreements. That is what really allows CSX to then undertake
the capital work necessary. Certainly, from Amtrak's
perspective, we are ready. We have trains, crews, we are ready
to go. But we need the work to advance, and we will be doing
everything we can to get the service started as soon as
possible.
So, I will be able to update you soon here, and I would be
happy to come to your office to do that.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Needless to say, it is incredibly
important to the people of our region, economically,
environmentally, and every way you can possibly imagine.
We missed the boat, as you may recall, years ago when then-
Governor Jindal opted to not take the resources to create this
advancement. Fortunately, we are moving forward now, and we are
prepared to help in any way we can.
Mr. Coscia, do you have anything to add to that, sir?
Mr. Coscia. No, other than to indicate that the Board has
followed this particular expansion very closely, and we are
sort of very hopeful that it will be initiated.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Thank you. How would you describe
your experience in working with the freight railroads to
restart service between New Orleans and Mobile?
Mr. Gardner. Well, at this point, it has been very good.
For a long time there was debate between us about this. But we
have come to agreement, and the FRA, who has been an amazing
partner, and the Department of Transportation has invested and
spent a lot of time helping to bring the parties together here;
they have been doing important work.
There are really two big infrastructure components. There
is Positive Train Control installation by Norfolk Southern in
Louisiana, and then this additional work needed in Mobile so
that we have a station track. So, those are the two predicate
projects before service. And both partners are strong, are
working with us, so, we need to just get these elements done
with Mobile and be able to move forward.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. I have about 18 seconds. The
proposed New Orleans to Baton Rouge rail line will operate
through an area some dub--and we are not proud of--an area
referred to as cancer alley because of the amounts of
petrochemical and industrial activity in that area.
In terms of pollution reduction, can you speak to how the
communities in these areas will benefit from the mass reduction
in car trips near their homes due to passenger rail lines?
Mr. Gardner. Well, Congressman, we are excited about Baton
Rouge service, and that corridor is in the FRA Corridor ID
Program and is developing here. We are working with the host
railroad, CPKC, and we think that there will be real appetite
for this service and a major opportunity for folks to have an
alternative to driving. And, as you say, it will remove cars
and the emissions associated with them in that corridor.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Any idea how to quantify the
amount of reductions we will enjoy?
Mr. Gardner. That will be part of the Corridor ID planning
process----
Mr. Carter of Louisiana [interrupting]. $500,000 that was
awarded----
Mr. Gardner [interrupting]. That is right. Well, that is
the start, and that allows them to go into step 2, which is
really the, kind of----
Mr. Nehls [interrupting]. The gentleman's time has expired,
and we have got votes coming up here for a bit. I am trying not
to be, but----
Mr. Carter of Louisiana [interrupting]. Thank you. My time
has expired.
Mr. Nehls [continuing]. We want to try to finish before
votes here.
I recognize Mr. Burchett for 5 minutes.
Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Gardner, a year ago, I asked you about Amtrak's
proposed annual operating loss. You told me it would be over
$800 million.
What is the new projected annual operating loss?
Mr. Gardner. About $670 million.
Mr. Burchett. $670 million. And last year, you also
confirmed that, according to Amtrak's 5-year plan for fiscal
year 2022 and through 2027, that Amtrak expects to lose $1
billion every year.
Has your expected loss increased due to inflation?
Mr. Gardner. No. I think our--our 5-year plan beginning in
2022 anticipated higher losses than we, in fact, have
experienced. We have been able to drive that number down last
year and this year. So, we are continuing to drive that number
down below that.
Mr. Burchett. To what point?
Mr. Gardner. Well, again, our goal here is the end of the
decade to reach a, sort of, position of break-even on the train
operating side of the business, recognizing that there is a big
portion of operating expense associated with the capital work.
So, we will be able to help you see that.
But our goal is to continue to make progress. We are
setting our targets for next year here soon, so, that will be
something we work on with the Board. But, again, year-over-year
improvement from last year, and we will continue to make
improvement next year in reducing the loss.
Mr. Burchett. You-all's executives were paid between
$500,000 and $780,000; on top of that, the executives received
bonuses last year of at least $200,000. I don't blame you. I
blame the Board. I mean, it is the contract you signed up
under.
But I am wondering, how do I explain to folks in east
Tennessee who are currently struggling, paying 600 more dollars
a month out of pocket just for living expenses through all this
Bidenflation, the executives of a company that isn't even
profitable get annual bonuses worth more than some of their
homes. Mr. Coscia?
Mr. Coscia. I assume, Congressman, you are addressing that
question to me?
Mr. Burchett. Yes, sir. I am sorry.
Mr. Coscia. I was starting to respond to this, in part, to
your colleague's question, which is to say that, as I
mentioned, I have been on the Board since 2010. And I can only
answer that question within the context of having seen the
before-and-after picture.
I would say that Amtrak, for decades, probably 40 decades,
suffered from both a chronic underinvestment in capital, in a
capital-intensive business, and, frankly, weak management that
allowed many practices to develop at the company that were not
best practices.
I have spent nearly 40 years in the private sector, much of
it with very successful companies. I know what good looks like.
It did not exist when we showed up. We intentionally revised
the compensation program at the company because, at the time,
the company had a very, very lucrative pension and post-
retirement plan that would have cost us more than triple of
what the incentive compensation plan had cost.
We are paying, sir, at the amount of bonuses that we are
paying at the incentive comp, we understand the anxiety that it
creates here on the Hill and other places with a company like
Amtrak that is serving this public purpose, but I also will
tell you that an operating company that has to compete for
employees with the freight railroads, the airlines, the
hospitality business, the engineering companies, all of whom
pay their employees far more than we do--we have no chance of
succeeding without bringing in the team and putting them on the
field that have an ability to do it.
This team brought Amtrak for the first time in its 50-year
history to within $27 million in fiscal 2019 to breaking even.
That has never even come close. And, in 2020, had the pandemic
not occurred, we would have been in black ink on an operating
level for the first time ever.
Now, all of the headwinds that Mr. Gardner described to you
that are creating a struggle for us to get back, we will get
through them, and we will be back in black ink. And I will tell
you that the Board's objective for how quickly to get there is
even quicker than I am assuming that is otherwise being
considered.
Mr. Burchett. I appreciate that. I am going to run out of
time. But the one thing that is crystal clear to me is that the
American taxpayers are being forced to fund you-all, and you
have--for instance, you have a subpar dining experience, which
ironically contributes to Amtrak's operating deficit, all while
these executives make $200,000 bonuses.
To me, that is unacceptable. And I yield the remainder of
my time, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Garcia for 5
minutes.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Chair and Ranking Member
and all of our witnesses. A part of my district, about half, is
located just outside Chicago and is deeply tied to the rail
industry, as are many parts of Chicagoland. As the rail capital
of the country and a growing economic hub, Chicago is a prime
location for expanding intercity passenger rail.
Mr. Gardner, the Chicago Hub Improvement Project, or CHIP,
is a large project to improve the service and eliminate delays
at and around Chicago Union Station for intercity connections
throughout the Midwest. More than 30 million riders pass
through the station annually, and there are 400 train movements
each day.
How is this project progressing, and has the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act benefited this project?
Mr. Gardner. Yes. Thank you, Congressman. And we appreciate
your support and focus on Chicago. It is, as you say, the
epicenter of the Nation's rail network, and it is the heart of
Amtrak's national network.
And the CHIP program really, simply, is about getting
passenger-favorable routes into Chicago Union Station, which is
the heart of our national network for long-distance trains, and
the Chicago hub service, where we serve not only Illinois and
downstate Illinois trains, but also Michigan, Wisconsin, now
Minnesota, and other services, so, really important.
The program has been a recipient of funds under the IIJA
and also most recently in the appropriations bill. We are
focused right now on concourse expansion, which is really
improving the outdated concourse that serves both our
passengers and Metra passengers so that we can provide a much
better level of service at the station.
At the same time, we are looking to connect our routings
out of the yard and terminal facility to be able to get those
passenger-focused routes so we do not incur delays for both our
trains to the east and the south.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you. CHIP involves bringing
together a wide array of stakeholders. Amtrak, Metra, commuter
rail, and the Illinois, Chicago, and Michigan Departments of
Transportation.
How does Amtrak work with freight and commuter railroads to
advance the CHIP improvements, and would having access to
guaranteed funding similar to what highways have help this
project get finished?
Mr. Gardner. Well, let me start with your last point first,
which is that, absolutely, guaranteed funding is essential to
undertake a program like this. This program is a multiyear
massive project that is going to involve many different
stakeholders.
We talk sometimes about some of the big projects in the
Northeast Corridor, but this is even more complex because we
have many railroads, we have many different elements of
Government, we have different States. We all need to come
together and work as a team to accomplish this work.
So, having dedicated funding and support for both planning
and execution is going to be absolutely critical. Otherwise, we
simply will not be able to advance this kind of multiyear work.
In terms of working together, we have a strong working
relationship, obviously, with Illinois DOT, with our freight
railroad partners, and with Metra at the core, along with the
city, CTA, et cetera, where we are looking to find those win-
win opportunities that both enhance today's service but create
capacity for the future.
Another really important piece here is building more
capacity for future growth on the yard side so we have more
mechanical capacity. Because, as the States look to grow
service, we need a place to park trains and service them well
in Chicago.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you. My last question: How is
Amtrak prioritizing high-speed rail projects across the
country, and what obstacles exist in terms of investment and
infrastructure needs?
Mr. Gardner. Well, it is a great question. So, as I said
earlier, high-speed rail, we think, makes a lot of sense in
certain markets in the United States. Not all markets, but
certain markets really have the density and the possible travel
time that really support high-speed as we see all over the
world.
So, we are working to support those corridors that are in
development. Several are funded through the Corridor ID Program
that FRA is leading. We have talked about the opportunities
that we see in Texas, and we are evaluating those. And we see
the great work that has happened in the St. Louis corridor of
providing service up to 110.
Now, that certainly isn't the high-speed that we all could
envision and hope for, but it makes a material difference,
because it creates that trip-time competitive reliable service.
So, we are focused on both those near-term opportunities.
One of the best is the S-Line that we are working on with
our colleague here in North Carolina. The opportunity to take
that corridor and create a dedicated 110- or 125-mile-an-hour
corridor that can relieve congestion on the rail side and
create a faster trip is hugely important.
The core of this, though, is that we don't----
Mr. Nehls [interrupting]. Thank you, Mr. Gardner.
Mr. Gardner [continuing]. Have money for high-speed rail.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman's time has expired.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. Mr. Yakym, you are recognized.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our
witnesses for being here today.
Earlier this year, the committee held a hearing focusing on
the role commuter rail lines play in our communities. I was
pleased that the South Shore Line, which operates in my
district, was able to participate and share some of the
benefits of commuter rail in north central Indiana.
Additionally, the South Shore shared some of the challenges
they face. Just last month, after a decade of planning,
financing, and construction, South Shore opened its $650
million double track service. It was an incredible
accomplishment that will greatly benefit the Hoosiers that I
represent.
My question, Mr. Gardner--it is good to see you again, by
the way. We have spoken a few times on prior occasions, both in
my office, as well as in this committee. As we have discussed,
the double track capital project was not funded by Amtrak in
any way. Yet, of course, Amtrak is essentially, inviting itself
on to the double track.
Can you reaffirm your commitment that if Amtrak invokes
this authority, you will work with the South Shore on the
timing of those routes and compensate them appropriately?
Mr. Gardner. Well, thank you for the question. Good to see
you again. And--so, first, I did have a chance to congratulate
my colleague there at NICTD on the launch of service, and we
are very excited for the work they have accomplished.
As I said before, Amtrak is right now just in the process
of evaluating different options. We are doing this together
with the FRA and the States to look at ways that we can--it is
called the South of the Lake Challenge of providing service
from the east to Chicago and looking at the different
opportunities there long term. So, we are still in the planning
phase.
I did commit and I will continue to commit that we would,
of course, work with our partners there at the South Shore
about any possible use of the infrastructure. Amtrak does have
rights to use the infrastructure, but we would do so pursuant
to the Federal rules and only as a result of cooperation and
partnership.
So, a big choice here also will be the role of the State of
Indiana and the other States and their interests in terms of
investment. So, this is still an early phase, and we will work
with Mike and the team there at South Shore as we consider this
and other options.
Mr. Yakym. Great. Thank you for that continued commitment,
and we will certainly hold you to that.
Switching gears to another topic, Mr. Gardner. According to
the most recent progress report on Amtrak's compliance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, Amtrak has addressed
its ADA responsibility in 119 of the 385 stations.
I know there is bipartisan frustration with Amtrak's
lackluster compliance with the ADA, which was signed into law
in 1990. My question is, Amtrak will get $22 billion in funding
from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA. How
much of that money will go toward complying with the ADA?
Mr. Gardner. Great question. Of course, we share that
frustration. And I think, over my tenure at the company, we
have really done a lot to change that trajectory, investing
over $800 million in ADA improvements.
And right now, we have about 190 stations that are
compliant either entirely or all the way except the platform,
and that is another component. We have about 140, almost 150
stations in design. All the design will be done the end of next
year. We have got another roughly 70 stations in construction
in some form occurring this year. So, we are making great
progress.
About $1 billion, a little more than $1 billion, of that
$22 billion is dedicated to these ADA improvements.
Mr. Yakym. Great, thank you.
Mr. Gardner. So, we are on track and working with FRA on
that.
Mr. Yakym. I know that Amtrak is looking to use some of the
$22 billion from IIJA to expand into potentially new service
stations.
Will you commit that Amtrak will not inaugurate any new
service stations on routes with stations that are not ADA-
compliant?
Mr. Gardner. So, typically, the FRA, when we go to start a
new station, a requirement is that it is ADA-compliant before
we do that. Now, we do have instances where we have temporary
stations that are before a final station is complete.
But we always make sure it is accessible. So--but we are
required to have compliant stations.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you. And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. Mr. Menendez, you are recognized.
Mr. Menendez. Thank you, Chair.
Thank you, Ranking Member.
Thank you to our witnesses. Mr. Gardner, Mr. Coscia, it is
always great to see you and to be able to partner with you on
these incredibly important projects.
The Gateway Program is one of the largest and most urgent
infrastructure projects in the country and will improve
reliability and resiliency for some of the most heavily
trafficked miles of railroad in the country, and our district
is home to the bulk of this project in New Jersey.
Just this week, the Federal Transit Administration
announced a full funding grant agreement for the Hudson Tunnel
Project, which will build a new two-track Hudson River rail
tunnel to connect New Jersey to Manhattan.
This agreement is a historic milestone for this project and
is the next step towards finalizing the largest ever mass
transit grant in U.S. history. This is incredible news for our
district. It will not only make significant strides in
improving rail service, but will bring tens of thousands of
jobs to our region.
It is a privilege to sit on this committee and work with my
colleagues on the committee and in our district to see this
project to completion.
Mr. Gardner, can you expand upon how the IIJA has resulted
in more reliable service for those who use intercity passenger
rail on a regular basis?
Mr. Gardner. Well, thank you, Congressman. And we are
overjoyed at the investments that are coming here to propel the
Gateway Program forward. And, as you say, it is an incredible
program. It is really to take the biggest bottleneck on the
North American system, really, the two-track main line between
Newark and New York, which is the busiest main line in North
America, and create a four-track crossing that is reliable and
that can serve for decades; hopefully, centuries ahead, really.
So, we are really excited by that work.
In addition to that project, there are a number of others
in the region. There is the Portal North Bridge program, which
is already underway, funded before IIJA. We have got the
Sawtooth program, Dock Bridge, and a whole series of
improvements that are being propelled because of the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law investments.
So, it has really been decades in the making, these
deferred investments, many we inherited when we took over the
corridor in 1976, and this is the first time we have had the
dollars available to make these improvements, and in
partnership with the States, because these are not just Amtrak
and Federal investments. The States have, as my colleague here
has said for North Carolina, we look for skin-in-the-game
participants here who can invest as well.
So, in addition to those huge projects, we are spending a
lot of money trying to rebuild the railroad today. So, we get
more reliability. The same issue for the tunnels that exist at
the track level, switches, signals, overhead catenary. These
systems are in some cases from the 1930s.
So, we have got to rebuild them, and we are out there doing
that and trying to balance that with service because it is hard
to rebuild the rail while you are running trains. So, we have
got to find that right mix and be able to get more and more
investment out in the railroad and have that show up as better,
more reliable service for passengers.
Mr. Menendez. Absolutely. And I just want to quickly,
because I want to be respectful of the other Members, just give
you an opportunity to follow up on this. Because we know about
the incidents the last couple of weeks on the Northeast
Corridor, et cetera.
You alluded to this in your prior answer, but just want you
to be able to speak directly to the commuters, the residents of
the district, and how does the IIJA funding towards the
Northeast Corridor, how will it minimize and eventually
eliminate incidents like what we have seen the last couple of
weeks on the Northeast Corridor?
Mr. Gardner. Yes. Well, so--thank you. The events of the
last couple weeks were a combination of some infrastructure
failures and some equipment issues on New Jersey Transit side.
Again, we share this railroad today and 24 trains an hour. It
is the busiest railroad service in the U.S. here in this
section.
So, on the infrastructure side, the big issues we had were
some of our overhead wires. Again, this system that supports
the traction power for our trains is from the 1930s. We have
fatigued, ancient, really, designs and old equipment here. And
it is made more difficult because there are very little windows
to be able to go and do the work.
So, what the IIJA is allowing us, in partnership with New
Jersey Transit to do, is go out and programmatically address
those known critical areas of failure so that we can remove
them.
Meanwhile, these big projects are going to have huge
improvements as well because we are going to put entirely new
systems of power and signals in their locations and things like
Portal Bridge today, which sometimes opens and gets stuck;
those kind of delays which can throw a commute period into
total chaos, they will be gone or dramatically reduced.
Now, it is going to take some time, but we apologize to
those who have been impacted by this. Of course, it is the last
thing we want to do is have unreliable service, and we are
working hard. But we are digging out of a deep hole. And it is
going to take a lot of money and time. Thankfully, Congress'
support here has given us that pathway.
Mr. Menendez. Absolutely. And I appreciate all the work. I
know there is a lot more work to do.
I yield back. Thank you both so much.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you.
Mr. Kean, you are recognized.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you. And I will follow up,
Mr. Gardner and Mr. Coscia. It is good to see you both here.
The Northeast Corridor is the busiest rail line in the U.S.
It is vital for over 51 million Americans. My constituents, it
is extraordinarily important to their lives, livelihoods, and
the economic growth and safety within the region.
However, struggles with aging infrastructure leading to the
delays that we have just now recently discussed and a $40
billion repair backlog, building on the previous question, what
is next, when you are looking at the importance of commerce and
movement, what are the urgent needs that remain that have not
already been authorized that Amtrak is looking for?
Mr. Gardner. Well, thank you so much for the question and
for your support here. I know how important this railroad is to
New Jersey and to mobility throughout the region.
The big things that I think are remaining are, really, in
three areas. One, we have only started this process of the
catenary renewal and the signal system upgrade. And we need
prolonged funding for that because already the big dollars in
the IIJA have been dedicated to some of these massive projects.
So, there is more work to do.
Now, these huge projects are going to deliver incredible
benefits, but they don't resolve all of the issues. So, having
funding that is going to take us into, sort of, the next
tranche of investment is going to be really important coming
out of this core investment.
Additionally, we do need to work together with our partners
to create more time to undertake the construction work because
that is a challenge. Tonight, there will be folks working out
on the railroad, but they will probably get less than an hour
of uninterrupted time before trains come by and they have to
pull back from the railroad and go to--and that kind of on-
again/off-again work makes it inefficient to get the work done,
and some work is impossible to complete without shutting down
the railroad entirely for a period on the overnight.
So, those are really important components. And I think the
other element here is there is a need for additional capacity
in targeted areas beyond the Gateway section just to
accommodate the growth we anticipate coming from New Jersey
Transit and Amtrak over the long haul.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you. I have got a question
that I have asked you for a very long time, both on State level
and now here in this room.
Amtrak Connects U.S. proposes new corridor service for 16
States and expansion of service in 20 States at a cost of $75
billion. Similarly, CONNECT NEC 2037 proposed more frequent
service, connections to new markets, additional capacity, and
reduced travel time on the Northeast Corridor over 15 years.
The question here--still unresolved--is more Acela stops.
At Trenton, right now, there are none. Metropark is, what, one
a day perhaps, but phasing and going in one direction. And, if
you are looking at future expansion, why are we not looking at
doing a better job and more frequent access to New Jersey's
State capital, to the economic and innovation entity that is
around Metropark, and we are looking at more consistent and
predictable service for the State of New Jersey?
Mr. Gardner. So, Congressman, I know you are passionate
about this. And we have--as you said, we have changed some of
the service levels around the various stations in New Jersey.
In particular, we have seen an increase in service in New
Brunswick and Princeton Junction and EWR at the airport rail
station, and we have seen some reduction in the Acela service
in Trenton, as you mentioned, and a small reduction in
Metropark service.
Now, we are, as I committed before, as we introduce the new
Acela service and also our additional regional new trains, the
Airo sets that start showing up in 2026, we will have more
capacity and be able to relook at all the service patterns.
Today, the demand has really shifted in these markets, but
we will adopt a continual view at the demand here so we can get
service in the right markets, because we understand how
important it is to have service at Trenton, and we do think
that there is an opportunity for Acela there.
Right now, given the limited frequencies we have, because,
in part, we are waiting for more equipment, the priority has
been on some of the other places that have produced more
revenue and ridership----
Mr. Kean of New Jersey [interrupting]. If we are going to
do what is necessary for the economic growth of New Jersey's
capital city and one of the main innovation centers both in and
around Trenton, as well as in and around Metropark, we need
more consistent service and more predictability and more stops
over the course of the entire day.
Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. Mr. Stanton, you are recognized.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you
for letting me join for this important hearing today. I
represent Phoenix, Arizona, one of the fastest growing cities
and communities in the country, and the largest metropolitan
area in the United States without access to passenger rail
service. Amtrak's Sunset Limited travels between New Orleans
and Los Angeles, running through Tucson in southern Arizona.
Adding service in the Phoenix area will open up the entire
State to important economic opportunities, opportunities to
make our communities more accessible, more productive, and more
internationally competitive.
This past December, we took the first step towards re-
establishing service at the Federal level. The Arizona
Department of Transportation was selected for the Federal
Railroad Administration's Corridor ID Program and granted
initial funding under our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to
develop a scope, a schedule, and cost estimate.
As you know, there is very strong local bipartisan support
for re-establishing this connection. Mayors of a dozen Arizona
communities along the proposed line have thrown their support
behind the effort, including Phoenix, Mesa, Tempe, and
Chandler, the communities that I represent in Congress.
And the State of Arizona has put substantial dedicated
resources, $3\1/2\ million, towards this critically important
planning effort. Arizona is sending a clear message to
Washington and to Amtrak: We are serious and ready to move on
with this project.
Mr. Gardner, Phoenix and Tucson is just one Corridor ID
project of many across the country, nearly 70 across 44 States,
as referenced by my colleague from New Jersey.
While I know Amtrak may not engage with State DOT Corridor
ID projects until phase 2, the service development plan, what
is Amtrak doing right now to plan for the next phase of this
project?
Mr. Gardner. Well, thank you very much for the question.
And it is a great corridor, one we are really excited about.
Phoenix is the largest city we don't serve directly here. And
really it is a huge omission on our map and something we have
long believed needed to be remedied. So, we are really excited.
I had a chance to meet with the Governor. I had a chance to
meet with Mayor Gallego and Mayor Romero, a number of mayors
across the corridor; as you say, incredible bipartisan local
support here and excitement about the opportunity to bring
passenger rail into this corridor.
So, the Corridor ID Program, as you said, is really the
process by which this would be developed. We are supporting
Arizona, and we will be able to undertake some additional work
with them as they go through this program. We have, to date,
given a fair amount of attention and focus on the opportunities
here, but the FRA program will really set the pathway forward.
But we continue to look for opportunities to partner with them.
And then phase 2 is really when we can undertake additional
studies and work with them to drive things like revenue
ridership and other opportunities.
Similarly, we were leading the return to 7-day service on
the Sunset route. There is obviously overlap here. So, this is
an area in which we are excited to advance, and we are going to
do that in partnership so that we can have an efficient
planning process and get value from both projects together.
Mr. Stanton. I want to get to phase 2. If Amtrak is
selected, and my expectation is they will be--you can't say
that, but I can; I will expect that Amtrak will be selected--I
look forward to engaging closely with you. One of the reasons
this issue is so important to me is because passenger rail will
boost our regional economies with better access to jobs, more
private investment along this route. Maybe you can talk a bit
about that in the little time I have left.
Can you talk about how expanded rail service drives private
investment?
Mr. Gardner. Absolutely. We have seen incredible
investments that have followed the type of service introduction
that you are describing here. Whether it is in Maine where the
Downeaster service has established a whole transit-oriented
development program and sort of revitalization of communities
in New England, whether it is what we see being planned already
in Colorado as they look to develop Front Range service, there
is a huge amount of interest and density that gets developed,
frankly, when we create this node of mobility with passenger
rail.
So, we expect both immediate improvements to occur in the
station area where folks locate both housing and commercial and
office because they want that benefit of being able to connect
efficiently to other markets. And then, beyond that, we see
benefits in housing in community and overall attractiveness in
terms of competitiveness for communities that have this kind of
service, and particularly amongst the younger generation. I
know the Congressman mentioned that folks are looking for a
trip-time competitive service. We completely agree. But I would
note that there are many folks who would rather take the train
than drive, even if it is a little bit longer. Now we got to be
in sort of the ballpark. But, frankly, people find the train
more productive and more relaxing than driving in many places,
particularly, younger generations. And that is important for
communities attract----
Mr. Stanton [interrupting]. Thank you so much.
Mr. Chairman, so we don't miss votes, I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. The gentleman yields. Are there any
further questions from members of the committee that have not
been recognized?
Seeing none, this concludes our hearing for today. I would
like to thank each one of you for being here. The committee
stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 4:04 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Submissions for the Record

Statement of Michael Friedberg, Executive Director, Coalition for the
Northeast Corridor, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Troy E. Nehls
The Coalition for the Northeast Corridor (CNEC) appreciates the
opportunity to provide a statement for the record for the upcoming T&I
hearing on Amtrak. CNEC proudly commends the historical and
transformative impact of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA) on our nation's most critical transportation lifeline--the
Northeast Corridor (NEC). As a coalition representing a broad spectrum
of stakeholders, we have witnessed firsthand the diligent allocation of
funds and the forward momentum of projects that are essential for the
NEC's modernization.
The region served by the NEC--stretching from Boston to Washington,
D.C.--is home to over 51 million Americans. Prior to the pandemic, more
than 820,000 passengers rode approximately 2,200 trains through the NEC
each day. The corridor boasts a regional GDP of $5.8 trillion, ranking
it third in the world if it were its own country, behind only the U.S.
and China. Despite these impressive figures, much of the NEC operates
on infrastructure dating back to the early 1900s, which is prone to
unexpected failures that delay service and impact lives and the
economy.T he NEC's state of good repair (SOGR) backlog stands at well
over $40 billion. While the IIJA has provided a significant boost to
our infrastructure, it is not a panacea.
The Northeast Corridor (NEC), a vital artery for commerce and
connectivity, has seen significant advancements, reflecting the IIJA's
commitment to modernizing our nation's infrastructure. Projects that
were once visions on paper are now taking shape across the NEC,
bringing with them enhanced safety, increased capacity, and improved
reliability. These advancements are not merely improvements; they are
the building blocks of a more prosperous future for the entire region.
However, the journey does not end here. The IIJA, while monumental,
is but a stepping stone. There are still unaddressed needs within the
NEC that require urgent attention--needs that were not within the scope
of the IIJA. These include critical upgrades to aging infrastructure,
major station development, expansion of capacity to meet growing
demand, (both infrastructure improvements and the procurement of
additional trains), trip-time and speed improvements, and the
integration of innovative technologies to ensure the NEC remains a
global standard-bearer for rail transportation.
CNEC urges Congress to recognize that the IIJA is a down payment on
our infrastructure's future--a future that demands ongoing investment.
The private sector is poised to continue its partnership with the
public sector, working hand in hand to bring these generational
projects to fruition. It is this collaboration that will ensure the
success and sustainability of the NEC for years to come.
We call upon Congress to sustain its commitment to infrastructure
investment. The NEC is not just a series of tracks and stations; it is
the backbone of the Northeast's economy, supporting hundreds of
thousands of jobs and serving as a critical conduit for commerce and
mobility. Investing in the NEC is investing in the nation's economic
vitality and competitive edge.
As we look to the future, let us do so with the understanding that
infrastructure is the foundation upon which our society is built. It is
the enabler of opportunity, the connector of communities, and the
driver of innovation. The CNEC is dedicated to advocating for a NEC
that meets the demands of today and anticipates the needs of tomorrow.
In conclusion, the CNEC thanks the committee for its attention to
this vital issue and for its past support of the NEC. We implore you to
continue championing infrastructure investment, recognizing that the
prosperity of our region and our nation is inextricably linked to the
health and functionality of the NEC.
Thank you for your consideration and for the opportunity to submit
this statement for the record.

Statement of James Tilley, President, Florida Coalition of Rail
Passengers, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Troy E. Nehls
Introduction
My name is James Tilley. I am President of the Florida Coalition of
Rail Passengers. The Coalition is a 501(c)3 and was formed in 1983 to
preserve and to improve passenger rail service for Floridians and
visitors to our state. Since FCRP's inception, we have been an all-
volunteer organization made up entirely of citizen rail advocates. I am
also a member of the Rail Passenger Association which advocates for
passenger rail nationwide.
Prior to my retirement I held several positions dealing with
railroad equipment including Vice President-Sales & Marketing for
Bombardier's railcar financing affiliate. Additionally, I served as
Vice President-Car Management for Genesee & Wyoming, an international
holding company owning and operating more than 100 railroads. Finally,
I was responsible for CSX Transportation's railcar leasing program as
Assistant Treasurer.
The Situation
There is a high probability that a shortage of long-distance cars
will force Amtrak in the next several years to reduce service on its
non-state supported National Network system. The shortage of bi-level
Superliners will be most acute and will place the routes that use
them--all seven in the West and two in the East--at greatest risk.
Between FY19 and FY23, Amtrak scrapped ten of these cars and stored 35
more. Derailments since then--most caused by collisions with heavy
trucks at grade crossings--have taken cars out of service faster than
the Mechanical Department could repair them. As a result, Amtrak had 45
fewer Superliners in active service at the end of FY23 than it did
before Covid and ten fewer than it had just two years ago.
Equally concerning is the probability that between now and the time
Amtrak gets new equipment, future derailments will further reduce the
number of serviceable cars.
When Amtrak will get this new equipment is uncertain. The current
estimate--``early 2030s''--is both vague and years in the future. There
is a good chance, also, that it will take much longer. Reflecting the
complexity of Amtrak's RFP, the manufacturers invited to submit bids
have already indicated they will not be able to meet the May 2024 bid
deadline and Amtrak has, indeed, extended it. Nor have they confirmed
that they can build the new equipment to Amtrak's specifications.
Nippon Sharyo's failure to build a bi-level that meets American
standards should raise a cautionary flag. In addition, the delays
Amtrak has experienced with past equipment procurements make it prudent
for management to anticipate--and plan for--the likelihood that
delivery and commissioning of new equipment to take much longer than it
currently expects.
Discussion
The Five-Year Plan just released does not consider the reality of a
permanently smaller long-distance fleet. Here are some examples:

Achieving the goal of a 10% increase in long-distance
seat miles in FY24 seems improbable. The Monthly Operating Report for
January 2024 showed that the actual year over year increase in the
first quarter was only 1.8%. That makes achieving a 10% increase for
the year a bigger challenge--13% growth in each of the three remaining
quarters.

Achieving the goal of 4.44 million seat miles in FY29
seems equally unrealistic. That's 2% more than the 4.37 million seat
miles Amtrak operated FY19 but with 58 fewer cars (Superliner,
Viewliner and Amfleet II).

The FY25 Grant and Legislative Request similarly shows a lack of
awareness of the serious long-distance fleet issues that exist today.
This quote from the Request illustrates how detached from reality
management seems to be.

``The company is not planning any reductions in Long-Distance
service and does not currently anticipate having to temporarily
decrease service frequency because of factors beyond the
company's control (e.g., equipment and workforce limitations of
the kind that temporarily affected service during FY22).''

Strangely absent from the request is any recognition, much less
discussion, of the existing shortage of long-distance capacity that Mr.
Gardner claims only additional federal funding can resolve. The silence
is puzzling, deafening actually. It should be as obvious to management
as it is to those of us outside Amtrak that in order for Congress to
approve such funding, Amtrak's board and management must aggressively
request it and dramatize the specific, positive benefits it will
produce, and the negative consequences if it doesn't.
Despite ongoing work to restore previously discontinued long-
distance routes and to upgrade both the Sunset Limited and the Cardinal
to daily operation, Amtrak fails to mention or publicize the fact that
the lack of equipment will remain an insurmountable obstacle for many
years. Curiously, Amtrak, in its RFP for new long-distance equipment,
directed prospective bidders to assume ``no increase in the scope of
the existing long-distance network.'' Mr. Gardner has made it very
clear that once Amtrak takes delivery of the new equipment, he has no
interest in using any of the existing Superliner equipment to expand
consists, increase frequencies, restore routes, or accommodate surges
in traffic. Where he expects to obtain the additional equipment needed
for any expansion remains a mystery.
Although the Mechanical Department exceeded its goal for overhauls
in FY23, production was insufficient to reverse the downward trend the
number of long-distance cars in the active fleet. Further, the goal for
Superliner overhauls in the Annual Operating Plan for FY24 is 19% lower
than the number actually achieved in FY23. In addition, Amtrak has kept
more than a dozen Viewliner 1 sleeping cars stored, inactive for
several years.
The Amtrak Inspector General recently reported how deficiencies in
the way Amtrak manages its parts inventory impairs productivity in the
Mechanical Department. It found that parts catalogs were inadequately
detailed or provided inaccurate information. It especially criticized
the practice of robbing parts from active cars to avoid late departures
of other outbound trains, explaining that it caused significant
dysfunction downstream including, for example, inaccurate information
about actual quantities used that in turn resulted in either oversupply
or out-of-stocks. Because mechanics were not always diligent about
reporting that they had ``borrowed'' a part, reports overstated the
number of cars actually ready for service. The adverse impact on morale
in the Mechanical Department has been significant.
The OIG report confirmed many of the problems that I pointed out to
Mr. Gardner when I met with him in New York nearly a year ago. Below is
the recap of our discussion that I sent him in my letter of May 4,
2023.

``Internal Amtrak Sources Report that Field Personnel are
hamstrung, and that industry is slow delivering current and
prospective rail car orders.

``Work orders and internal approvals that are needed
to get work into and out of the shops are profoundly delayed.''

``Too many layers of managers and supervisors
combined with a deeply broken set of processes for identifying
problems and getting them fixed.''

``Industry is telling Amtrak, in general terms, that
they might be able to begin fielding a first batch of new long-
distance equipment in eight to 10 years.''

``Alstom is completely failing in delivering the new
ACELA II train sets.''

Allow me to share excerpts from an interview with former Amtrak
President David Gunn, reported in Train Newswire on September 8, 2020,
about the company's announced plan to cut most long-distance trains to
triweekly operation. He predicted, correctly, that it would lead to a
permanent reduction in the amount of serviceable rolling stock and cost
the company the employee expertise necessary to run the system in the
future.

`` . . . with the way they are running the place [emphasizing
cost cutting], the equipment not in use will be cannibalized,
and you'll wind up with yards full of cars and locomotives full
of missing parts.''

``Mechanical people were being pushed to lower expenses,'' Gunn
recalls. ``If, say, an air compressor goes out and there's a
piece of equipment parked there, you just grab something off of
it instead of buying a new part. Your bottom line looks great
to your bosses--for the short term--until you need that car or
locomotive you just cannibalized.''

``Congress thinks they're not subsidizing the Northeast
Corridor except on capital, but the NEC is in more trouble than
the long-distance trains,'' Gunn continues. ``If you can't give
Congress a reason for keeping the long-distance network
together, then you can't give them a very good reason to
subsidize that corridor.''

On a related note, former Congressman Dan Lipinski summarized his
views two weeks later on September 20, 2020.

``Too often it feels like Amtrak is happy to take money from
Congress and then ignore Congress' directives.''
Conclusion
I think it is fair to conclude that Amtrak can achieve the long-
distance capacity and revenue goals contained in its latest Five-Year
Plan only if it finds a way to increase the number of serviceable long-
distance cars during the years between today and that uncertain time in
the future when it can put new cars go into service. It needs to add
such a plan--and the resources to execute it--to its planning documents
and funding requests.
To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin, ``Hope is not a plan, and no plan
is a plan for failure.''

Questions to Stephen Gardner, Chief Executive Officer, National
Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), from Hon. Troy E. Nehls

Question 1. Based on employee complaints, the Amtrak Office of
Inspector General (OIG) conducted an investigation and issued a
redacted report on criminal activities taking place at one of its
facilities.\1\ The report noted several security vulnerabilities at the
site and further found that it may take years for Amtrak to implement
adequate security measures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Amtrak, Off. of Inspector Gen., OIG-MAR-2023-006, Safety and
Security: Observations on Security at the [Redacted] Facility (May 9,
2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1.a. Please describe if Amtrak has addressed all the OIG's
recommendations to address security vulnerabilities. If not, what is
your timeline for completing them, to ensure a safe experience for both
employees and passengers?
Answer. We are committed to addressing the OIG's recommendations
and have already made significant progress:

Physical Security Upgrades: Amtrak, through its Corporate
Security (CS) and other groups, is actively working on security
projects at seven of the ten facilities identified in the report. These
projects encompass improvements like fencing, video surveillance, and
access control systems. The targeted completion date for these projects
is September 30, 2026, depending on the availability of federal
funding.

Inventory Access Control: Amtrak is implementing a new,
more-stringent access control strategy for high-risk inventory
facilities. All Materials Management locations across the country now
have restricted access to internal customers, with some exceptions,
using combination keypad access systems or Smart ID badge readers.

Monitoring Abnormal Inventory Use: Amtrak has established
within our Mechanical facilities a Production Control Team (PCT)
responsible for monitoring inventory usage. The PCT generates reports
to identify anomalies and investigate potential misuse. They also
review material usage against planned maintenance needs. This process
will be fully operational as of September 30, 2024.

Ordering Limits: Amtrak is leveraging existing
functionalities to implement ordering limits on inventory. Currently,
limits are placed on total facility material orders and can be set for
specific parts. We are working on further improvements to address
limitations in multi-order scenarios and will utilize historical data
to establish appropriate benchmarks. Full implementation of ordering
limits is targeted for September 30, 2024.

Inventory Management Practices: Weekly Integrated Supply
Demand Planning (ISDP) meetings are being held to address material
needs and usage across facilities. These meetings promote effective
ordering practices and will be expanded to include all relevant
Mechanical PM facilities. This initiative is already underway.

Amtrak is working diligently to address these identified
vulnerabilities and is committed to keeping you informed of our
progress. Thank you for your continued support of Amtrak's safety
initiatives.

Question 1.b. It becomes difficult for law enforcement effectively
provide security if police arrest criminal trespassers but prosecutors
refuse to bring charges.
Question 1.b.i. How many instances of crime at Amtrak stations are
perpetrated by repeat offenders?
Answer. While Amtrak does not currently publish specific data on
the number of crimes committed by repeat offenders at stations,
internal review shows for a three-year average, approximately 23
percent of incidents at Amtrak stations involve repeat offenders.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amtrak actively uses the COMPSTAT process to analyze data and gain
a clearer picture of recidivism rates and identify potential areas, or
people of interest, for intervention.

Question 1.b.ii. Please describe the steps Amtrak is taking to
ensure law enforcement on their trains and at their facilities have the
resources they need to combat criminal activity.
Answer. Amtrak does believe generally that the criminal justice
process, in some communities, could help achieve safer outcomes by
pursuing charges for lower-grade offenses like trespassing.
This belief stems from the ``broken windows theory,'' which is
founded on the experience that minor offenses, like trespassing, left
unchecked lead to more serious crimes. This is a complex issue
requiring an approach that addresses the root causes of crime and
utilizes various strategies. While law enforcement cannot directly
dictate prosecutorial decisions, we are committed to collaborative
efforts that ensure public safety.
Amtrak's Multifaceted Strategy:
To effectively address trespassing and other lesser offenses,
Amtrak and our APD has implemented a multi-pronged approach:

Enhanced Security Measures: We are continuously investing
in our security personnel and have achieved a nearly fully staffed
Department. The use of canine detection teams and surveillance
technology help support our significantly safe system.

Strengthened Partnerships: Amtrak actively collaborates
with law enforcement at the Federal level with DHS and DOJ and has a
strong partnership with TSA. This collaboration involves joint patrols
for improved visibility, information sharing and cross-training
initiatives to ensure a coordinated approach.

Outreach Programs: When local communities cannot
adequately address critical issues like the those presented by the
unhoused, APD has stepped up and engaged private social service
providers to reduce quality of life issues at some key stations--in an
effort by the Department and Corporation to stem ``broken windows''
that can lead to more serious crimes.

Question 1.c. What is Amtrak proactively doing at its facilities to
address passenger and employee safety and security?
Answer. Amtrak, through its APD and other departments, prioritizes
a data-driven, collaborative approach, emphasizing:

Modern Policing Practices: Intelligence-led deployments,
collaborative partnerships with stakeholders.

Investment in Officer Training & Well-Being: Ongoing
training, robust wellness programs.

Continuous Improvement: Maintaining CALEA (Commission on
Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies) accreditation, adapting to
evolving threats.
Enhancing Safety Through Data-Driven Strategies
We leverage data analysis to identify crime trends and
strategically deploy personnel for a targeted response. This
``precision policing'' approach, based on the proven COMPSTAT model
developed by Commissioner Bill Bratton and the NYPD, optimizes resource
allocation and facilitates swift, effective interventions.
Building Trust Through Collaboration
Amtrak recognizes the importance of fostering trust and
partnerships with passengers, employees, and local law enforcement
agencies. We achieve this through targeted outreach programs that not
only equip officers with the necessary skills but also strengthen
relationships with the communities we serve.
Investing in Our Officers' Success
Amtrak's Police Department prioritizes officer training and well-
being. We offer comprehensive training programs in de-escalation
tactics, cultural competency, and the latest law enforcement
techniques. Additionally, robust wellness programs support the mental
and physical health of our officers, ensuring they are well-equipped to
handle the demands of their profession.
Maintaining the Highest Standards
The APD maintains accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation
for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA), a rigorous process that
guarantees adherence to the highest national standards for law
enforcement agencies. This ongoing commitment to excellence ensures our
policies, procedures, and operations are continually reviewed and
optimized.
Adaptability in a Changing Landscape
Recognizing that the nature of crime is constantly evolving, Amtrak
remains agile in its approach. We consistently adjust strategies and
resource allocation as needed to stay ahead of emerging threats and
ensure the most effective use of resources.
Addressing Specific Concerns
General National Trends

Violent Crime: Homicides across America decreased 10% in
2023 compared to 2022, but remain 18% higher than pre-pandemic levels
(2019). Aggravated assaults are down slightly from 2022 but still
elevated compared to 2019.

Property Crime: On the rise. Property crimes increased 7%
nationally in 2022, with motor vehicle thefts showing the sharpest
increase (11%).

While national crime trends may diverge from our experience, Amtrak
proactively manages calls for service and officer activity data to
pinpoint the causes of crime within the Amtrak system. This allows us
to develop targeted solutions and address potential issues before they
escalate.
Amtrak and APD's performance shows our focus and commitment:

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Amtrak is dedicated to providing a safe and secure travel
experience for all Amtrak passengers and employees. Through our data-
driven approach, collaborative partnerships, and unwavering commitment
to officer training and well-being, we remain confident in our ability
to continually improve passenger and employee safety across the Amtrak
network.

Question 1.d. Fare evasion has become a major problem for many
transit providers such as New York City's MTA and Washington, DC's
WMATA. Does Amtrak track data on how many fare evaders they encounter
each year or an estimate on how much revenue is lost as a result? If
so, please provide the data for the past three years to the Committee.
Answer. Amtrak does monitor reported cases of fare evasion--those
who attempt to ride our service without purchasing a ticket. We are
currently pursuing an initiative to assess the impact of fare evasion
on Amtrak operations and expect to have more data in the coming months.
Given Amtrak's over 30 million passenger trips, fare evasion is not
currently a significant cause of lost revenue. However, we are
committed to enforcing fare rules and seeking additional opportunities
to reduce this behavior.

\
\ 2024 data represents the first 6 months of the calendar year

Question 1.e. Does Amtrak ensure that tickets are checked after
each stop on a train? If not, please explain why.
Answer. Amtrak's conductors are required to check/scan each
passenger's ticket after boarding the train. Conductors also ``sweep''
the train at each crew change point to ensure passengers are collected/
scanned. In rare occasions, there may be situations where a conductor
is unable to do so, such as working alone, or a scanning system
failure. In those cases, the conductor would ``force lift'' all the
tickets on the train. `Forced Lift' is an automated back-of-house
function that protects ticket revenue if conductors are unable to scan
all tickets on the train. Unscanned tickets are processed by the
`Forced Lift' function, which triggers the revenue recognition process
in Amtrak's accounting systems.

Question 2. As Amtrak ridership continues to increase post-COVID-
19, it is essential that Amtrak continue to improve its service and,
most importantly, its safety record. It is well known that grade
crossings pose one of the high safety threats for both passenger and
freight railroads.
Question 2.a. What trends has Amtrak seen in regard to grade
crossing safety incidents?
Answer. Highway-rail and trespassing incidents account for 96.26%
of all rail transportation mode fatalities. With regards to Amtrak
trends, the bulk of train strikes occur on non-Amtrak controlled rail
routes. Impacts with large industrial vehicles have been revealed as a
significant source of risk due to the increased likelihood of customer
and employee injuries and fatalities. 24 strikes with large industrial
vehicles have occurred since FY 2021, and some of these strikes have
resulted in major derailments. Congress's support for targeted
Commercial Motor Vehicle grade crossing safety and awareness could be
helpful in reducing risks here.

Question 2.b. How many safety incidents have occurred this past
year that involved Amtrak trains?
Answer. Across the industry, grade crossing strike rates have
remained flat. As pre-Covid highway vehicle and train traffic frequency
returns, our grade crossing strike incidents have also returned to pre-
pandemic levels.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Question 2.c. What steps has Amtrak taken to improve its safety
record at grade crossings?
Answer. Grade crossing incident reduction/elimination is an
industrywide challenge beyond the ability of any one entity to address.
However, Amtrak does believe that we have an opportunity and
responsibility to influence decision making to improve safety in this
space. Amtrak's efforts include:

Adopting methods to identify and quantify hazards when
highway and railroad operating conditions change.

Improve identification and analysis of hazards before and
after crossing incidents occur.

Monitor and understand commercial and residential changes
adjacent to our service routes.

Strengthen external data sharing partnerships with large
industrial vehicle companies, host railroad partners, law enforcement
agencies, and local governments.

Inform discretionary grant funding opportunities to
allocate funds for crossing engineering improvements.

A practical example of how this approach improves safety on our
service lines is present in Illinois on the Chicago to St. Louis
corridor. On this route, Union Pacific, the Illinois Commerce
Commission, Amtrak, and the Federal Railroad Administration have worked
collaboratively to close 128 crossings since January 1st, 2000. Each
crossing installation in high-speed areas on this route has been
upgraded to include technology that communicates with approaching
locomotives to warn of grade crossing appliance health. These efforts
alone have resulted in a tangible improvement in grade crossing safety.
On this route, there were 62 vehicle grade crossing strikes between
2000 and 2010. Between 2010 and 2018, there have been 38 grade crossing
strikes with vehicles, with no grade crossing strikes occurring since
2018. The collaboration and investments observed and the results
achieved are both exemplary and effective.

Question 3. ``Amtrak Connect US,'' proposes new corridor service
for 16 states and expansion of service in 20 states at a cost of $75
billion. Similarly, ``Connect NEC 2037,'' proposes more frequent
service, connections to new markets, additional capacity, and reduced
travel times on the NEC over 15 years.
Why has Amtrak chosen to dedicate resources to expanding service in
unproven markets without first focusing on long-standing maintenance
and safety improvements to the current system?
Answer. Amtrak Connects US was a visioning document developed by
Amtrak in March 2021 to outline what expanded service could look like
if funding was made available. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act (IIJA) established the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
Corridor Identification and Development Program (Corridor ID) to guide
intercity rail development throughout the U.S. In December 2023, FRA
selected 69 corridors to advance through Corridor ID. The expansion of
service to new markets is being led and directed by FRA and the states,
and Amtrak is supporting those corridors that choose Amtrak as an
operator. 27 of the 69 corridors are existing routes, providing funding
to improve the trip time, reliability, and frequency on those existing
state-supported services. We believe that growing the intercity
passenger rail network is a smart investment to strengthen mobility,
improve the environment and support community development. While
Amtrak's first responsibility is to operate our current network as
effectively as possible with the given resources we receive, we fully
support the FRA's efforts to develop new services, as smart network
growth should allow Amtrak to both become more economically efficient
over time and meet the changing needs of the United States as
population grows, travel patterns change, and congestion continues in
other modes of transport.
The Northeast Corridor Commission's CONNECT NEC program is a
capital investment plan to bring the NEC to a state of good repair and
provide improvements that will result in a modern and resilient
railroad with safe, reliable and more frequent service, with reduced
travel time between communities. The program focuses first and foremost
on replacing and repairing the aging, over 100-year-old infrastructure
along the NEC. This includes major backlog projects such as Connecticut
River Bridge Replacement Project (CT), Devon Bridge Replacement (CT),
Saugatuck River Bridge Replacement (CT), Walk Bridge Replacement (CT),
Pelham Bay Bridge Replacement Project (NY), East River Tunnel
Rehabilitation Project (NY), Hudson Tunnel Project (NY/NJ), Sawtooth
Bridges Replacement (NJ), Highline Renewal and State of Good Repair/
Dock Bridge (NJ); Susquehanna River Bridge Replacement Program (MD),
Bush River Bridge Replacement Program (MD), Gunpowder River Bridge
Replacement Program (MD), and Frederick Douglass Tunnel Program (MD).
All of these projects were identified in the CONNECT NEC Program and
received FY22-23 Fed-State Partnership-NEC awards.
In summary, both the FRA Corridor ID program and the NEC Commission
CONNECT NEC Program dedicate resources to improve existing services and
infrastructure.

Question 4. California just petitioned the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) to allow it to implement its so-called In-Use Locomotive
Regulation. This rule would effectively require all locomotives,
including passenger locomotives, to operate in a Zero Emissions
configuration when operating in California. Currently, Amtrak does not
operate electric trains in California.
Question 4.a. The public comment period on California's proposed
regulation closed in April. While all the other railroads submitted
comments, Amtrak did not. Does Amtrak oppose this regulation?
Answer. Amtrak generally supports the aims of the proposed
regulation--the transition away from carbon emissions in railroad
industry--and has adopted its Net Zero Program as a pathway to
eliminating greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. Amtrak's commitment to
sustainability is felt in California, as Amtrak has worked with its
State partners to transition locomotives from traditional fossil fuel-
based diesel to renewable diesel. While Amtrak supports CARB's goal to
transition from carbon emissions, it believes that this process should
move forward in a way that maintains service and mobility in the
industry and believes that its own Net Zero Program would be sufficient
for accomplishing these goals.

Question 4.b. If the EPA approves CARB's regulation, it could be
adopted by a number of other states. What would this regulation do to
the cost of providing that service?
Answer. Amtrak's sustainability and environmental programs
demonstrate that it is committed to reducing and eliminating its carbon
footprint. This firm commitment means that Amtrak would be well-
positioned to comply with the proposed regulation if it was approved by
the EPA. Furthermore, while the original text of the CARB regulation
could have threatened passenger rail viability in California, CARB
provided passenger rail an alternative compliance option, the
Alternative Fleet Milestone Option (AFMO), in its final regulation. If
approved by the EPA, the flexibility provided by the AFMO will
significantly reduce the cost to Amtrak of complying with the proposed
regulation because it accords with the timelines already in place for
Amtrak's own sustainability goals.
That being said, Amtrak believes that its own Net Zero Program is
sufficient in order to achieve the net zero emissions goals
underpinning CARB's proposed regulation. And Amtrak may incur
additional expenses over its own programs if it needs to comply with
CARB's proposed regulation. While those expenses are speculative at
this point, it is likely that any such expenses would be multiplied if
other states adopted regulations similar to CARB's.

Question 5. Amtrak recently put into service its new Venture cars
on its San Joaquin's Oakland to Bakersfield route in California. A
recent media article noted that there is no dining service on the
train, even though the full trip takes approximately six and a half
hours.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Roger Rudick, Review: Amtrak California Passengers are Starving
for New Trains, StreetsBlog SF (Feb. 1, 2024), available at https://
sf.streetsblog.org/2024/02/01/review-amtrak-california-passengers-are-
starving-for-new-trains.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 5.a. Why is there no dining car service for such a long
trip?
Answer. Amtrak partners with the San Joaquin Joint Powers Authority
(SJJPA) and California State Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to
operate the San Joaquins service. The SSJPA and Caltrans purchased and
own the new Siemens Venture Cars used on the San Joaquins, and are
utilizing the San Joaquins to pilot alternative food service delivery
options with the new trainsets. Most of the items purchased in the cafe
will be available in the future vending service.

Question 5.b. Why does Amtrak continue to post a Cafe Car menu on
its website if the service is discontinued? The current notification
that the service has been suspended is in small lettering. Should it
not be clearer to passengers there is no dining car service?
Answer. The SJJPA and Caltrans are preparing a vending food service
onboard their new Siemens Venture Cars which are operating on the San
Joaquins intercity passenger rail corridor. The vending service will be
provided on two cars per train and bring food service closer to the
passenger and at a marketable price-point. As SJJPA and Caltrans
prepare the vending service, the San Joaquins operating with the new
Siemens Venture Cars are providing complimentary snacks and water to
its passengers. As the new equipment is put into service, passengers
may encounter trains with cafe service, or trains with complimentary
snacks and water. To address any confusion caused by this mixed fleet,
Amtrak and SJJPA have been working on different strategies to make
passengers aware of the different cafe or food service options. The
partners will continue to look for new ways to make this clearer to the
passengers.

Question 6. Amtrak was on the path to profitability prior to the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, Amtrak recently projected $1 billion in
annual losses through 2027, in its Five-Year plan through Fiscal Year
2027.
Question 6.a. Ridership has almost fully recovered to pre-pandemic
levels. Please explain why Amtrak expects to post such staggering
losses.
Answer. In FY2020, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Amtrak was on
track to reach break-even on operations, with revenues exceeding
operating costs. Amtrak has made significant strides in restoring
ridership and revenue: both are above pre-COVID levels, and we
anticipate continued increases as we work towards doubling our
ridership by 2040. While our year-to-date revenues through May are
nearly 5% higher than during the same period in FY2019, they continue
to be impacted by reduced business travel since the pandemic, as
virtual meetings have replaced many short-duration and short-distance
business trips, and reduced capacity due to shortages of equipment and
service disruptions not within our control.
Like other transportation providers, Amtrak's financial performance
has been significantly impacted by inflation. The consumer price index
has increased by 23% since 2019, and costs for many of the goods and
services that drive Amtrak's operating expenses, such as diesel fuel,
electricity and wages and benefits, have increased even more. Amtrak is
also paying a larger share of the operating costs of state-supported
routes due to updates in the methodology for allocating costs between
Amtrak and states required by the IIJA, and incurring greatly increased
costs in areas such as cybersecurity. The enormous increase in capital
spending for major investments funded by the IIJA has been accompanied
by many additional capital delivery-related costs that are considered
operating costs under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

Question 6.b. Does Amtrak have a plan for reversing this trend? If
not, please explain how you can continue to ask the Federal Government
for support and taxpayer resources without a strategy for
profitability.
Answer. Yes, Amtrak does have a plan for our passenger train
service to at least reach break-even by the end of the decade. This
does not include operating costs associated with our capital delivery
business, much of which we are doing as a result of enactment of the
IIJA.

Question 7. In 2020, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Amtrak
reached an agreement which mandates that Amtrak create and implement an
action plan to bring all service stations for which Amtrak is
responsible into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA). As of 2024, only 30 percent of Amtrak stations are ADA
compliant.
Question 7.a. How many stations operated or used by Amtrak are
currently out of ADA compliance?
Answer. Amtrak serves 520 stations in the U.S., of which it has ADA
responsibility for either the station, platform, or parking or
combination thereof at 380 stations. Of those 380, 125 are compliant
for the areas Amtrak has responsibility for as of the end of June 2024.
There are an additional 67 where all but the platforms are compliant,
and those platforms are under construction, in design, or scheduled to
go into design.

Question 7.b. Does Amtrak have an action plan to bring service
stations into compliance? If so, please provide a copy to the
Committee.
Answer. Yes. For the remaining 265 stations Amtrak is executing the
``ADA Sunset Plan'', which is an annual submission to the FRA and DOJ
that details Amtrak's plan to bring those stations into compliance.
Amtrak's 2023 ADA Sunset Plan is attached. The 2024 Sunset Plan is
currently in review with the FRA, and not yet final.
[Editor's note: Amtrak's 71-page ``ADA Stations Program Sunset
Plan'' dated June 1, 2023, has been shared with Rep. Troy E. Nehls and
is retained in committee files.]

Question 7.c. Does Amtrak have a timeline for implementation of
this action plan? If so, when will all stations become compliant with
the ADA?
Answer. Yes. Amtrak anticipates completion of the work in the ADA
Sunset Plan by the end of 2029.

Question 7.d. If not, why and when can Amtrak be expected to be
fully compliant with the ADA and fulfill its agreement with the DOJ?
Answer. Amtrak intends to fulfill its agreement with the DOJ by the
end of 2029.

Question 8. An important feature of Amtrak stations is that these
terminals are or can be developed into intermodal hubs for a variety of
transportation modes that connect and exchange passengers. This
Committee would like to see Amtrak be a welcoming host to other
transportation modes--both public and private.
What is Amtrak doing to encourage other modes to co-locate at its
major terminals and will Amtrak be supportive of more intermodal access
at stations you own or occupy?
Answer. Amtrak supports intermodal connectivity across our network
in order to enable access to Amtrak services and encourage multi-modal
trips. Amtrak currently provides intermodal connections at its large
stations, with transfer opportunities to local transit, intercity
buses, bikeshare, rideshare, taxis, and private cars. These stations
include Amtrak's large hubs along the Northeast Corridor, including
(but not limited to):

Boston South Station, with connections to MBTA services;

New York Moynihan Train Hall, with connections to NYC
Transit, LIRR, and NJ Transit;

Philadelphia William H. Gray III 30th St Station, with
connections to SEPTA services, NJ Transit, and Martz buses; and,

Washington Union Station--with connections to WMATA,
MARC, and VRE, Greyhound, Megabus and more.

Beyond the Northeast Corridor, Amtrak also provides intermodal
connections at numerous cities across the National Network, including
(but not limited to):

Chicago Union Station, with connections to both CTA and
METRA;

Los Angeles Union Station, with connections to LA Metro
and Metrolink;

Dallas Union Station, with connections to DART Light Rail
and TRE;

Seattle King St Station, with its connections to
SoundTransit; and

Birmingham Station, AL with connections to MAX transit
and Greyhound.

Amtrak also provides intermodal connections to airports throughout
its network, including direct station stops at Newark Liberty
International Airport (EWR), Baltimore/Washington International
Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI), Milwaukee Mitchell International
Airport (MKE) and Hollywood Burbank Airport (BUR). Furthermore, at
select stations across its network, Amtrak provides direct rail to bus
transfers through its Thruway service, bookable through a single fare
journey, to extend its reach into communities off our passenger rail
network, particularly in the upper Midwest, Rocky Mountains, Pacific
Northwest, and across California.
Additionally, Amtrak is supportive of ensuring that passengers may
continue to take advantage of these easy and convenient intermodal
connections through its recent service additions and future planned
projects. Some of these projects include:

Borealis Service--launched in May 2024, Borealis brings
passengers directly into Downtown St. Paul, Minnesota to Union Depot,
where they can seamlessly transfer to Metro Transit's Green Line for
further travel into Minneapolis and the Greater Twin Cities area.
Borealis also connects riders to additional intermodal hubs, including
Milwaukee Airport Station and Chicago Union Station. Since launching
service, Borealis has served approximately 18,500 riders per month. It
is anticipated to carry approximately 124,000 total passengers within
its first year of service.

Goleta Depot--Amtrak is working in cooperation with
California State Transportation Agency, under the Transit and Intercity
Rail Capital Program (TIRCP) to upgrade the existing Goleta, CA station
along its Pacific Surfliner route into a full-service, multimodal
facility. This new facility will create dedicated spaces for bus
transit and local transportation services serving the Santa Barbara
area, including the airport and University of California at Santa
Barbara. The upgraded station will also see improved pedestrian access
to the surrounding neighborhood (including full ADA compliance at the
station), and dedicated bicycle facilities. By improving these
important transit and pedestrian connections, both the city and Amtrak
hope to increase station access and Pacific Surfliner ridership.
Construction is anticipated to begin September 2024.

Detroit New Center Intermodal Facility--Amtrak is working
in cooperation with the Michigan Department of Transportation and the
city of Detroit on a proposal to replace the existing Detroit Amtrak
station and the current Greyhound depot with a consolidated intermodal
facility with connections for rail, ridership, light rail, local
transit and intercity bus.

Within the constraints of its operating requirements and the
ability of our partner services or other stakeholders to appropriately
share in the appropriate investment and operating costs, Amtrak strives
to locate its new stations in areas with existing transit and
intermodal access to facilitate easy and seamless transfers between its
services and complementary transportation modes. When designing new
stations, often with our state partners, Amtrak works to ensure that
designs for new or renovated stations consider the potential for multi-
modal access and connectivity for both passengers within the facility
and vehicles outside the facility. Doing so not only provides riders
with the ability to continue their journey with as little inconvenience
as possible, but also makes our stations and facilities easier and more
convenient to access. Amtrak continues to work alongside its transit
and intermodal transportation partners to ensure, together, that
passengers may make these connections through clear signage and
wayfinding, co-locating services within close proximity, and providing
riders with ultimate choice in choosing their mode of transportation.
Amtrak will continue to be supportive of enhancing multimodal access
throughout our network and make possible connections that are
efficient, feasible and convenient for customers and operators.

Question 9. Regarding Washington, DC Union Station, I understand
Amtrak is in the process of acquiring large portions of the Station
through eminent domain. Congress authorized the Union Station
Redevelopment Act to create an independent Union Station Redevelopment
Corporation (USRC) to develop the Station as an intermodal
transportation hub as its primary mission (with economic development as
a secondary mission).
Please describe how Amtrak respects the independent mission of the
USRC board and supports a continued, expanding, and vibrant role for
the other transportation modes at Union Station.
Answer. From its inception, Amtrak has been a strong supporter of
and enabling partner to the Union Station Development Corporation
(``USRC'') and its mission to redevelop and improve Washington's
historic train station headhouse. Amtrak has recently acquired, through
eminent domain proceedings, the sublease interest (``Sublease'') of
Union Station Investors, LLC (``USI'') at Washington Union Station
(``Station''), which was USRC's subtenant and Amtrak's sub-sublandlord.
USRC is now Amtrak's sublandlord at the Station. USRC's roles and
responsibilities at the Station do not change. USRC's Board of
Directors (``USRC Board'') will continue to fulfill its oversight and
governance obligations, as well as manage the station parking
facilities and oversee the broad Station Expansion Plan. Amtrak will
continue to work closely with USRC in our expanded role as USRC's
primary tenant as we continue to improve the experience of the
traveling public.
Amtrak is now the subtenant of USRC. Amtrak is committed to
ensuring the success of the Station and all modes of transportation
located there. The Station is the second busiest station in Amtrak's
national intercity passenger rail network. Amtrak agrees that a
successful and vibrant transportation center in Washington must
preserve all of the modes of transportation presently at the station to
serve the needs of the traveling public and the community that the
station is located within. USRC's Board will continue to fulfill its
oversight and governance obligations, with Amtrak's Board member being
one of the five members of the USRC Board. As we have for the past 10-
plus years that Amtrak's Board member has served as the Vice Chair of
the USRC Board, Amtrak will continue to work closely with other Board
members to further the mission of USRC, improve the experience of the
traveling public, and return the Station to a state of good repair and
vibrant multi-modal transportation hub.

Question 10. You are set to take possession next month of the lease
for the commercial space at Union Station. This will essentially make
you the only tenant of the building. You have indicated in court
filings and other venues that you plan to make some changes in the
building. Please explain in detail what changes you plan to make at the
station.
Answer. As stated above, Amtrak has acquired the Sublease and
Amtrak is the subtenant of USRC. The Sublease provides for the
subtenant to have overall management and operational control of the
Station, in compliance with the terms of the Sublease. Any work Amtrak
will do at the Station will be consistent with the terms of the
Sublease as well as subject to the approvals required in the Sublease,
by USRC and Federal Railroad Administration (``FRA''), as the authority
having jurisdiction at the Station. Amtrak acquired the Sublease
subject to all of the existing retail leases, licenses and other
commercial agreements. All of these retail tenants and licensees
continue to operate in the Station pursuant to the terms of their
agreements.
More specifically, in the coming months, Amtrak plans to create
temporary seating and waiting areas for passengers, improve `redcap'
services to assist customers, locate Amtrak customer service
representatives throughout the Station, add temporary signage to guide
passengers and visitors, and bolster security through both Amtrak
police and contracted private security. Amtrak will balance the needs
of the transportation public with streamlining changes to daily
operations with the commercial enterprise of retailers offering goods
and services to the travelling public as well as local residents.

Question 11. What percentage of the passengers who pass through the
station every day are Amtrak passengers as compared to Metro, MARC and
VRE? How would these changes benefit those passengers?
Answer. Any and all future changes that Amtrak makes at the
Station, such as increased security and more passenger seating or
waiting space, will be in consideration of the other stakeholders at
the Station and will not diminish or negatively impact their
operations. In fact, prior to Amtrak's acquisition of the Sublease,
MARC and VRE, have been, in effect, subtenants of Amtrak in the
station, and all of the rail operations jointly shared the limited
space made available under the sub-sub lease to Amtrak. Now as the
Sublessee, Amtrak and these stakeholders have the opportunity and a
mutual interest in developing a more vibrant and healthy Station that
will benefit all of the traveling public. MARC and VRE, as well as
Amtrak, are all seeing an increase in ridership, and their space needs
at the Station are correspondingly increasing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 12. What is the role of your landlord, the Union Station
Redevelopment Corporation, in the planning and execution of the changes
you would like to make and the fulfillment of your responsibilities
under the lease?
Answer. Amtrak has acquired the Sublease and Amtrak is now the
subtenant of USRC. The Sublease clearly defines the area and services
that Amtrak now controls. The Sublease provides for the subtenant to
have overall management and operational control of the Station, subject
to the terms of the Sublease including those related to the planning
and execution of changes to the Station. Amtrak has the same roles and
responsibilities at the Station as USI did. All of these retail tenants
and licensees will continue to operate in the Station pursuant to the
terms of their agreements.

Question 13. The fact that Amtrak will be the lessee of the
building and the sub-lessee for the concourse facilities appears to
create an inherent conflict of interest, and eliminates certain checks
and balances. How can you perform both roles in a way that protects the
interest of the riding public and the building owner--the American
taxpayer? Please explain who is responsible for overseeing Amtrak, as
the railroad, in its performance under the sublease for the concourse.
Answer. Amtrak's acquisition of the Sublease actually creates a
much clearer, balanced, and more conventional structure for management
of the station, with no conflict of interest. Amtrak's acquisition of
the Sublease provides more checks and protections for the traveling
public and the American taxpayer than have existed in the past. Like
the prior Sublease holder, Amtrak will be subject to oversight by USRC.
But unlike the prior Sublease holder, which was a private investor that
did not have governmental oversight of its general activities within
the station, Amtrak is subject to significant oversight by the Federal
Railroad Administration (``FRA'') and Congress. Amtrak will continue to
comply with the applicable terms of the Sublease with USRC, and USRC
will have oversight over Amtrak pursuant to the terms of the Sublease
as Amtrak's sublandlord, as it did with USI.
Such an arrangement is not novel. Amtrak has experience in several
large stations of both performing railroad operations and managing a
station and commercial operations in a way that provides and enhances
the transportation services and amenities for the traveling public and
community surrounding the station. Amtrak has the same roles and
responsibilities at the Station as USI did. Amtrak recognizes and
agrees that as USRC's subtenant at the Station, Amtrak must comply with
the applicable terms and conditions of the Sublease. USRC will maintain
oversight of Amtrak through the terms and conditions of the Sublease.
The only difference between USI and Amtrak in the Station is that
Amtrak will now wear two hats--one as the manager/operator of the
Station, and one as the intercity passenger train operator at the
Station. This is not unlike several other transportation facilities
Amtrak operates within like Chicago Union Station and New York Penn
Station.

Question 14. What is your plan for following the requirement in the
Union Station Redevelopment Act that the station be managed to maximize
revenue flowing back into the building from the retail, office and food
operations there? What, if any, specific experience does Amtrak have
managing a mixed-use commercial real estate facility of this magnitude?
Answer. The USRA was put into place in the 1980s, with support from
Amtrak, to save Union Station and address the need for the then-current
redevelopment of the Station after the visitor center project was
unsuccessful. Congress tasked the Secretary of Transportation
(``Secretary'') with ``provid[ing] for the rehabilitation and
redevelopment of the Union Station Complex primarily as a multi-use
transportation terminal system serving the Nation's Capital, and
secondarily as a commercial complex.'' 95 Stat. 1667, Second 112. In
the 1980s, the United States Department of Transportation (``DOT''), in
coordination with USRC and a private developer, redeveloped the
Station. The USRA required that one of the goals of this redevelopment
was to ensure ``commercial development that will, to the extent
possible, financially support, the continued operation and maintenance
of [the] complex'' but it did not mandate any specific mix of retail or
business operations for that goal. Congress's policy statement at the
start of the USRA states that ``the purposes of this Act are to achieve
the goals of historic preservation and improved rail use of Union
Station with maximum reliance on the private sector and the minimum
requirement for Federal assistance.'' Pub. L. No. 97-125, 95 Stat.
1667, Sec.  2(7).
The USRA authorized, though did not require, the Secretary to enter
into agreements with private entities to rehabilitate and redevelop
Union Station and enter into lease agreements to manage and operate the
property. It also set out as a goal ``commercial development of the
Union Station complex that will, to the extent possible, financially
support the continued operation and maintenance of such complex'' but
it did not mandate any specific mix of retail or business operations
for that goal. Congress expressly prioritized the USRA's purposes--it
tasked the Secretary with ``providing for the rehabilitation and
redevelopment of the Union Station complex primarily as a multi-use
transportation terminal system serving the Nation's Capital, and
secondarily as a commercial complex.'' Thus, Amtrak's present and
future goals for improving rail passenger service while maintaining the
Station's commercial character are consistent with the USRA. In fact,
Amtrak intends to work with USRC, FRA and DOT to invest the revenues
from the Station back into the Station and is doing this because Amtrak
has a vested interest in the success of the Station.

Question 15. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) conditioned
their approval to permit Amtrak's use of Federal funding for the
eminent domain proceedings on the need to renegotiate and restructure
the lease with USRC, to the satisfaction of the FRA. This was intended
to increase investment in the station, and improve capital project
delivery, among other stated goals. With that being the case, what is
the process for restructuring the lease and when will the restructuring
be accomplished?
Answer. Amtrak appreciates the support that the FRA has provided
for Amtrak's acquisition of the sublease, as well as its commitment to
providing future funding. Amtrak reiterates its acknowledgment and
agreement of this requirement and is planning to renegotiate a new
sublease with USRC once the acquisition is complete as set forth in the
2022 FRA approval. The acquisition will only be complete once the
eminent domain litigation has come to a close. We are looking forward
to increasing the investment of revenues and other funds into the
Station so that much needed state of good repair work, deferred
maintenance work and capital improvements can be made to this important
and historical facility.

Question 16. Looking ahead, there is a plan for Washington Union
Station expansion. The Station Expansion Project recently received
environmental impact approval and the Union Station Redevelopment
Corporation (USRC) was designated the project sponsor. Given the
magnitude of the planned project, it is apparent the USRC will be
looking for the Federal Government to fund a significant portion of the
project. At present, the USRC is not directly eligible to apply for
Federal grants. As a member of USRC's Board of Directors do you think
they should be made directly eligible to apply for and receive grants
so they can fully serve the function as the project sponsor?
Answer. Amtrak reiterates its support for USRC as the Project
Sponsor for the Washington Union Station--Station Expansion Project
(``SEP'') and its support for USRC being made directly eligible to
receive grants and other funding from the federal government for the
SEP. Until this occurs, Amtrak is continuing to work closely with USRC
and FRA to fund short-term smaller projects required prior to the full
SEP implementation.

Question 17. I was glad to read in your testimony about the need
for Amtrak to demonstrate it is a responsible steward of taxpayer
funding given the historic levels of funding provided by the
Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act (IIJA). Unfortunately, there are
numerous reports of Amtrak employees and others abusing their positions
and Federal funding for personal gain. Examples include employees
receiving bribes for Federal contract benefits, pandemic relief fraud,
and misusing Amtrak resources, among others.\3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please describe Amtrak's plan to prevent these instances in the
future and assure taxpayers the funding it receives will be used in the
most effective manner possible.
Answer. At Amtrak we are committed to maintaining the highest
ethical standards in all our activities. Throughout the years we have
taken proactive steps to prevent fraud and corruption within our
organization through several initiatives and programs:

Our Ethics Program: Amtrak has long had an Ethics Office
led by our General Counsel. The Ethics Office provides advice to
employees on ethical concerns and administers our annual Conflicts of
Interest reporting process.

Amtrak's commitment to OIG collaboration: Amtrak is proud
to have developed a successful, proactive, and transparent
collaboration with our OIG partners. Leadership routinely interacts
with OIG Audits and Investigative teams throughout their engagements
and prepares written responses to their findings and recommendations.
Leaders in Risk Management leverage information gathered during OIG
investigations and institute changes to prevent or deter similar fraud
or misconduct.

Fraud Management Program: Amtrak's fraud mitigation
strategy involves upholding ethical corporate culture and employing
oversight of expenditures of federal funding. Recently, Amtrak has
implemented several items explicitly aimed at strengthening the
Company's fraud prevention posture.
+  Fraud Awareness and Prevention training: Designed to encourage
reporting of misconduct and empower employees to observe and respond to
fraud threats and/or incidents. This course is required during
onboarding and annually thereafter.
+  Anti-Fraud Policy: Support's Amtrak's fraud prevention,
detection, and response efforts. The policy sets expectations of
conduct and establishes actions taken in response to fraud allegations
and substantiated misconduct. When fraud or serious misconduct such as
abuse of position is substantiated, Amtrak takes appropriate
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
+  Fraud & Ethics Campaign: Working with Amtrak's leadership to
organize activities to raise awareness of fraud risks and encourage
ethical decision-making.
+  Employee Hotline and Internal Investigation: Enhancing intake
and investigation standard operating procedures and guidance to improve
efficiency and effectiveness of the process.

Strengthening its contract management governance
structure: Amtrak's approval processes for billing, payments, and
disbursements are designed so that appropriate authority limits and
segregation of duties are exercised, which limits the opportunity for
funding to be misspent. Amtrak is currently strengthening its contract
management governance structure and policies and procedures, which will
provide ongoing support and oversight for Capital Projects funded by
IIJA.

Strengthened corrective action management: Amtrak
actively strengthened risk mitigation practices by tracking OIG
findings, capturing measurable, achievable solutions, creating
accountability, and reporting closed items back to OIG. This process
ensures that we follow through on our commitments in order to maximize
the value from the reports.
+  Implemented an Internal Audit Function: Amtrak established an
internal systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the
effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes.
+  Implemented Compliance Function: Ensures Amtrak is in
compliance with its outside regulatory and legal requirements as well
as internal policies and bylaws.
+  Integrated Risk and Compliance Function (IRCP) Cross-
functional Collaboration: Risk, Compliance, and Internal Audit leaders
meet regularly to discuss enterprise risks and controls and to develop
tactics to enhance risk and compliance culture.

Question 18. In your testimony, you discuss Amtrak's new role in
implementing several large capital projects funded through the IIJA.
What has been Amtrak's experience in the permitting approval process
for these projects and are there areas where these processes can be
expedited while preserving environmental and other protections?
Answer. Through Amtrak's recent experience in implementing these
large-scale capital projects, we have observed some aspects of the
permitting process that could be improved which we believe could result
in expedited review times.
First, Agency understaffing can result in permitting delays. We
recently had a project in Connecticut where the only agency personnel
available to review our permit application were based in Alaska, and
they were assigned to the project several months after the agency
received the application and existing staff could not substantially
progress the review.
Also, there is a need for agencies to develop Programmatic
Consultation Pathways that can reduce the time spent consulting with
outside resource agencies such as SHPOs or other state or federal
environmental agencies.
Our last suggestion would be to standardize and increase delegation
to states and other agencies which should result in more predictable,
coordinated permit review requirements and timelines. Amtrak also
believes that agency delegation of authority to Amtrak to lead EIS
projects under NEPA would make for a more efficient process overall,
without compromising environmental protections.

Question 19. Given the historic level of Federal investment in our
transportation infrastructure through the IIJA, Congress and American
taxpayers have an interest in understanding where these investments are
being made and how funding is allocated across the country.
Question 19.a. Please describe the decision-making process that
Amtrak has used for how IIJA funding for Amtrak's National Network has
been allocated to specific locations, routes, and projects.
Answer. IIJA Supplemental funds appropriated to Amtrak were
allocated to projects based on Amtrak's priorities, and in accordance
with IIJA eligibility requirements. Funds were allocated for:

acquiring new rolling stock to replace obsolete passenger
equipment used by Long-Distance and State-Supported services, plus
rehabilitations, upgrades, or expansions of facilities that maintain /
store such equipment;

bringing Amtrak-served stations into full ADA compliance;

eliminating the deferred capital work backlog for Amtrak-
owned non-NEC railroad assets; and,

eliminating the backlog of obsolete Amtrak national rail
passenger transportation system assets (e.g., systems for reservations,
security, training centers, and technology).

The first two eligibility requirements align with Amtrak's ongoing
efforts to replace fleet and related facilities work (acquisition of
Airo and Long-Distance equipment and ALC-42 locomotives) and the ADA
program. These projects account for the majority of the funding
available, totaling $14B out of $15.6B available ($16B net of the FRA
and other take downs). The remaining funding was allocated to key
digital technology priorities to eliminate the backlog of obsolete
national assets, as well as to set up a programmatic contingency as
required by the FRA. The following table summarizes the projects funded
by the $16B of National Network IIJA Supplemental funds.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Question 19.b. What is the sequence of approvals that occur within
Amtrak leading up to the decisions about how and where funding is
allocated?
Answer. Projects were approved at the department level. IIJA
Supplemental funding for projects was discussed with Amtrak Finance,
and the selection of projects to be programmed was discussed with and
approved by the Amtrak Executive Leadership Team (ELT), and
communicated to the FRA via the IIJA Supplemental Detailed Spend Plan.
Projects were included in Amtrak's Annual Operating Plan (AOP) which is
ultimately approved by Amtrak's Board of Directors.

Question 19.c. What role does the Amtrak Board of Directors play in
this approval process?
Answer. Amtrak's Board approves the AOP. Amtrak's Board was also
briefed specifically on the projects using the $22B of IIJA
Supplemental appropriations, and how the projects were selected.

Question to Stephen Gardner, Chief Executive Officer, National Railroad
Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), from Hon. Rudy Yakym III

Question 1. I understand that the Commuter Rail Coalition is
proposing that the Surface Transportation Board act as the neutral
third party to address disputes between Amtrak and commuter railroads.
Does Amtrak support the CRC's recommendation? If not, why not?
Answer. It is not clear what CRC is recommending. Under existing
law, the Surface Transportation Board is already responsible for
adjudicating disputes between Amtrak and commuter railroads regarding
compensation for continued commuter railroad operations on the Amtrak-
owned portion of the Northeast Corridor and its branches and Amtrak-
owned trackage in Chicago (49 U.S.C. 22903(c)(2)); Amtrak's access to
commuter railroad-owned lines and facilities for existing and
additional operations (49 U.S.C. 24308); and implementation of and
compliance with the methodology for allocating Northeast Corridor costs
between Amtrak and commuter railroads (49 USC 24905(c)(4)).

Questions to Stephen Gardner, Chief Executive Officer, National
Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), from Hon. Steve Cohen

Food and Beverage Service
Question 1. In the Food and Beverage Working Group's report
submitted to Congress, the group found that ``delivering consistently
good service is not achievable without first fixing the systems that
are in play behind the scenes.'' The group developed more than 30
recommendations to improve onboard service, including opening dining
cars on all trains for all passengers regardless of ticketed class. In
November, Amtrak submitted its implementation plan for the
recommendations of the Food and Beverage Working group.
Question 1.a. Can you summarize Amtrak's progress toward
implementing each of these recommendations?
Answer. Overall, Amtrak was aligned with most of the Food and
Beverage Working Group's (FBWG's) high-level recommendations. Some
activities related to the recommendations were already underway at the
time of Amtrak's response to the original FBWG report, or will be
completed in FY24 and FY25. Other recommendations would require
additional funding if they were to be advanced and, in those cases,
Amtrak's response suggested that we would work with our partners to
secure additional funding from Congress. Accordingly, the company's
FY25 annual grant request seeks [https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/
projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/reports/Amtrak-
General-Legislative-Annual-Report-FY2025-Grant-Request.pdf] $27 million
above base needs for relevant activities, in the form of a ``Food &
Beverage Service Improvements'' modernization initiative; progress on
many items will depend on whether such funding is provided. At the time
of this response, the Fiscal Year 2025 Transportation, Housing and
Urban Development, and Related Agencies appropriations bill that passed
the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee on July 10, 2024,
proposed reducing Amtrak's annual appropriation by more than $300
million and did not include any of the requested funding to implement
the aforementioned food and beverage investments.
The non-exhaustive list below, covering twenty near-term
recommendations discussed in Amtrak's response to the FBWG report,
discusses selected actions for which progress is possible without
additional funding:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sample Actions & Sample
FBWG Recommendation                    Action Statuses
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Enhance Customer F&B Experience........  Hold ``platform calls''
(virtual meetings among F&B
leadership, supervisors,
and frontline OBS
employees) that are focused
on identifying problems
with and improving food
service onboard Amtrak
trains and in the
Metropolitan Lounges--
Complete (Platform calls
are being held on a regular
cadence.)

2. Establish Comprehensive F&B Experience.  Carry out at-seat ordering
pilot--Complete (No plans
to expand due to limited
customer take rate and no
revenue upside--but note
that customers who did use
the service during the
pilot program rated it very
highly, especially when we
tested a delivery-to-seat
model.)

3. Food Safety Compliance via Clear and     See answer in FBWG
Complete Ingredient Listing.                Implementation Plan.

food/beverage item.)

4. Install and Operate Satellite WiFi on    Initiatives to improve
All Amtrak Trains.                          onboard Wi-Fi service--In
Progress (Amtrak recently
issued requests for
information (RFIs)
regarding opportunities to
advance high-speed Wi-Fi
connectivity along the
Northeast Corridor; based
on what Amtrak learns from
these NEC-focused RFIs, we
will consider options to
bring modern, reliable Wi-
Fi to trains throughout the
country. )

5. Ongoing Oversight......................  See #1 (``platform calls''
action), #17, & #20.

6. Retrofit Existing Cars and Maintain      Refresh Superliner food
Fleet.                                      service cars (e.g., galley
equipment and dining car
banquettes)--In Progress
(Superliner equipment has
active refresh projects in
place.)

7. Align Amtrak and Aramark Staff Roles...  See #1 (``platform calls''
action).

8. Waste Control and Recycling............  Introduce a new NEC
recycling initiative (using
on-board cleaners to
collect F&B bottles/
containers and other
recyclable items)--Complete
(New procedures issued and
en-route cleaners are
actively recycling, using
two separate bags for
collection.)

9. Define Vision/Strategy for All Three     Publish new five-year plans--
Service Lines.                              Complete (The most recent
plans were published in
March, and lay out
strategies and/or goals for
each of Amtrak's three
operating service lines.)

10. Align Amtrak's Onboard Service Culture  See #1 (``platform calls''
action).

11. Establish a Rapid Cycle Process.......  See #1 (multiple actions).

12. Upgrade OBS Employee Training.........  Introduce new hospitality
training for F&B and other
customer-facing employees--
Complete (New training
program up and running; 700
employees already trained.)

13. Celebrate the Wins....................  Increase stakeholder
communications and keep
Congress apprised of
important developments--In
Progress (Periodic F&B
update transmitted to
Congress as part of FY 25
grant request; multiple
press releases issued
regarding F&B developments
(e.g., May 2024 reinvention
of Cafe Acela menu).

14. Long-Distance--Open Dining Car to All   Monitor performance of
Passengers.                                 traditional dining on
Silver Service trains
(recently added and made
available to Coach class
passengers) to determine if
a similar service model
could be adopted on other
routes (not in FY 24
plans)--In Progress
(Operating and customer
satisfaction data are being
gathered and analyzed;
however, there were
significant costs
associated with adding a
chef on these two routes.
Additional funding via
Amtrak's annual grant would
likely be needed in order
to expand traditional
dining to other routes.)

15. Increase Revenue While Meeting Needs..  Fully exploring
opportunities may require
additional funding.

16. Localize Product Onboarding and         Facilitate increased state
Removal for Regional and State-Supported    partner involvement in F&B
Routes.                                     service on State-Supported
routes via numerous
initiatives, including
issuing guidelines for
adding new F&B products to
facilitate addition of
regional F&B items
requested by states--In
Progress (Process being
evaluated; in the meantime,
steps are already being
taken to expand local
product offerings where
feasible (e.g., through
introduction of local
products on the Pacific
Surfliner in Q3 2024.)

17. Expand Quality Control Efforts........  Hire additional American
Railway and Airway
Supervisors Association
(ARASA) supervisors to
improve F&B quality with
special attention to food
preparation and service
delivery--In Progress
(ARASA supervisors riding
the trains on a regular
basis.)

18. NEC/Acela--Revitalize Acela...........  Make permanent the food
service cart on selected
Acela frequencies--Complete
(cart service expanded from
two to three carts; now
available on six
frequencies five days a
week.)

19. Creation of a Modernized Amtrak         See #20.
Customer Advisory Committee.

20. Amtrak Food and Beverage Advisory       Amtrak agreed on the
Committee.                                  creation of a Food and
Beverage Advisory Council
with membership from the
same stakeholder groups as
the FBWG. This Council is
intended to meet annually
to review progress of the
implementation plan and to
keep the dialogue ongoing
between stakeholders, as
established during the
working group's activities.
Its first meeting has not
been scheduled yet.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amtrak can set up briefings should any members wish for updates on
more potential actions discussed in Amtrak's response to the original
FBWG report, or on the report's longer-term recommendations.

Question 1.b. How does Amtrak plan to define and implement a
comprehensive vision and strategy for its food and beverage services
across Long Distance, State-Supported, and Northeast Corridor/Acela
service lines?
Answer. Amtrak's reply to the report of the FBWG includes both 1) a
high-level discussion of overall needs, benefits, and challenges
relating to food and beverage service, and 2) responses to twenty-one
discrete recommendations included in the original report. This document
is the most detailed and up-to-date discussion of Amtrak's food and
beverage plans currently available. Many of the constituent responses
contain information on specific plans for improving food and beverage
service; the report also provides information on whether the
feasibility of a given improvement depends upon the level of funding
provided by Congress.
Additional information can be found in various public documents, as
mentioned in the FBWG response. Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. Sec.  24320,
Amtrak publishes five-year plans for its service and asset lines every
other year. The most recent plans [https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/
projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/businessplanning/
Amtrak-Service-Asset-Line-Plans-FY24-29.pdf] were published in March
and lay out strategies and/or goals for each of Amtrak's three
operating service lines (Northeast Corridor, State-Supported, and Long-
Distance); each of these strategies discusses planned improvements to
food and beverage service. Additionally, we typically include a food
and beverage update in our annual grant request [https://
www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/
corporate/reports/Amtrak-General-Legislative-Annual-Report-FY2025-
Grant-Request.pdf] to Congress; that update covers both recent and
forthcoming initiatives. Both our five-year plans and our grant
requests are publicly available online at: Amtrak.com/reports.
Subject to resource constraints, Amtrak works to implement the
strategies articulated in our five-year plans; more funding would
enable us to do more, and our FY25 grant request specifically seeks $27
million for ``Food & Beverage Service Improvements'' above and beyond
our base needs. Assuming that base needs are fully met, if Congress
provides these additional resources, we will be able to advance
``actions that were favorably discussed in Amtrak's response to recent
Food & Beverage Working Group (FBWG) recommendations, but for which
necessary funding is not currently available''--potentially including
further expansion of traditional dining.
Should members wish to receive more detailed information on current
plans and opportunities, Amtrak can set up briefings.
Corridor ID Program
Question 2. The Federal Railroad Administration awarded a Corridor
ID program grant to the Atlanta-Chattanooga-Nashville-Memphis Corridor,
which would provide new service and connect these four major cities in
Tennessee and Georgia.
Question 2.a. How is Amtrak supporting state and regional partners
in the initial planning stages of the Corridor ID program as they
develop the scope, schedule and cost estimate of the corridor?
Answer. Partnering with Amtrak in Corridor ID means we can provide
technical assistance with many of the corridor planning activities. In
Step 1, selecting Amtrak as the operator will drive many elements of
the Step 2 Statement of Work and Service Development Plan (SDP)
resources. Amtrak can provide specific technical resources in the SDP
to help project sponsors develop ridership and revenue estimates as
well as Sec. 209 operating cost estimates. These technical resources
can be used instead of or in addition to consultant support. Amtrak is
also developing methodology reports for these technical elements and
has submitted them to FRA as a generic deliverable. Once approved they
can be made corridor specific. Once the SDP begins, Amtrak staff can
participate in technical review meetings of a technical advisory
committee or to address specific questions regarding the different
elements of a service development plan. Amtrak is also developing a
SharePoint site with Corridor ID support tools to assist corridor
partners as they navigate the Corridor ID Program. It will include
overview information, such as: what is required to be a state-supported
service, agreement templates and technical support for developing
ridership, and revenue and operating cost estimates.

Question 2.b. What challenges has Amtrak encountered in assisting
with the Scope 1 process, and what measures are being taken to mitigate
these challenges?
Answer. To date we have not encountered challenges in assisting
with Step 1 processes.

Questions to Stephen Gardner, Chief Executive Officer, National
Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), from Hon. Henry C. ``Hank''
Johnson, Jr.

Question 1. In my home state of Georgia, there are four long-
distance trains with an on-time performance between 67% and 49%. We
have heard plans for Amtrak to expand its service into Middle, GA,
where many residents don't have access to passenger rail.
Question 1.a. What are the major obstacles to improving on-time
performance on these new routes?
Answer. Amtrak services that operate through Georgia all suffer
poor on-time performance throughout their route due to Amtrak's lack of
control over the railroad beyond the Northeast Corridor. On nearly all
of the National Network, Amtrak trains operate over other railroads
(``Host Railroads'') and are subject to their dispatching and operating
rules. Over two thirds of delays incurred by Amtrak's long-distance
services are caused by Host Railroad-related activities. The most
common and impactful delays stem from prioritizing freight trains over
Amtrak passenger trains and routing Amtrak trains through slower
sections of track, among others. Improving on-time performance on
existing Amtrak routes and ensuring healthy on-time performance on any
future services generally requires better cooperation from host
railroads to reduce delays to Amtrak trains.

Question 1.b. Can you talk about any plans to add additional routes
in Georgia to increase access to surrounding states?
Answer. FRA is leading a Long-Distance Study which is evaluating
the restoration of Long-Distance services and potential new services,
greater than 750 miles. The Agency has identified 15 potential routes,
three of which would serve the state of Georgia: Chicago-Miami,
Houston-New York, and Dallas/Fort Worth-Atlanta. FRA will be issuing
its report by the end of this year which will provide its long-term
vision and identify funding that will be needed to move the recommended
routes forward.
In addition, FRA selected three routes serving the state of Georgia
in the Corridor Identification and Development Program (Corridor ID):
Atlanta-Charlotte, submitted by the North Carolina Department of
Transportation; Atlanta-Savannah, submitted by the Georgia Department
of Transportation; and Atlanta-Chattanooga-Nashville-Memphis, submitted
by the City of Chattanooga, Tennessee. While Amtrak has not been
officially selected as the operator of these prospective services, we
are excited for the future they represent for Georgia and the
southeast. For any Corridor ID participants that select Amtrak as an
operator, Amtrak will support those corridors in Step 2 of the program
to provide the resources to assist in creating a Service Development
Plan, including ridership, revenue, and operating cost analyses, as
well as other technical support as needed.

Questions to Anthony Coscia, Chair of the Board, National Railroad
Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), from Hon. Troy E. Nehls

Question 1. How does the Amtrak Board set metrics for bonus awards
that reflect meaningful performance goals, and what alternatives for
incentive structures were considered and ruled out? Please provide the
Committee with a copy of the metrics used to evaluate the latest round
of bonuses awarded to Amtrak executives.
Answer. Congress expects Amtrak to improve service, increase
productivity and maximize resources. Our incentive programs, like those
of Publicly Traded Companies and other Government Sponsored
Enterprises, support improving performance, reducing costs, and
attracting and retaining the talent needed to deliver on these goals
and is an ``at-risk'' program, meaning this compensation is not
available if the company or individual underperforms.
This reward structure aligns with the marketplace for talent, as
nearly 100% of large companies offer similar at-risk pay programs
versus the more costly alternatives often found in the public sector
that are not related to entity or company performance like retiree
healthcare and pension plans.
Setting Metrics

Amtrak's Board of Directors approves Amtrak's Strategic
Blueprint every 5 years (FY24-FY28) and Annual Operating Plan (AOP) at
the beginning of each Fiscal Year that includes financial and
operational metrics for short term and long-term success.

The Amtrak Board, which is an independent governing body
distinct from Amtrak's Executive Leadership Team (ELT), makes decisions
from a position of financial stewardship with the long-term health of
the company in mind and alignment with similarly sized comparators in
Amtrak's industry as well as Government sponsored enterprises.

Before the Board considers metrics for the short or long-
term incentive plan for a given Fiscal Year, it first approves the
company's financial and operating plans.

Amtrak's ELT, in collaboration with an external
compensation consultant, proposes short- and long-term incentive
metrics to the Board driven by, and aligned with, the company's
financial and operational plans, with metric weights that align with
similarly sized comparators in Amtrak's industry as well as Government
sponsored enterprises.

In approving short- and long-term metrics, the Board
considers current and anticipated industry conditions, prior company
performance, and Amtrak's 5-Year Strategic Blueprint.
Meaningful Performance Goals
Amtrak's Short-Term Incentive (STI) and Long-Term Incentive (LTI)
program are based on performance metrics that are tied to the company's
overall metrics of delivering more trains to more places safely and
with improved customer satisfaction and doing so with increasing
financial and operational efficiency (lowering operating losses and
reducing delays).
Like Amtrak's comparator companies, that means leveraging incentive
plans to place the largest focus (weight) of company performance on
improved financial performance and the remaining focus on key customer
service and operation metrics within Amtrak's Strategic Blueprint that
drive enterprise value that will benefit long-term financial
performance.
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Congress encouraged
Amtrak to develop a pay for performance incentive program for Amtrak
management employees tied to achieving goals (Passenger Railroad
Investment and Improvement Act (PRIIA) of 2008, Sec. 223). Amtrak also
moved managers from end of year fixed cost of living adjustments to
variable salary increases driven by merited performance.
In FY23 Amtrak delivered the following meaningful performance:

Ridership:  25% increase over FY22 to 28.6M with Q4 NEC
ridership above pre-pandemic levels with resumed service on all routes
suspended during the pandemic plus more trains on Northeast Regional,
Piedmont, and Amtrak Cascades routes

Major Infrastructure Investment:  $3B, largest annual
capital investment ever creating 4,800 new hires to support service,
growth

Adjusted Operating Earnings:  $130M improvement over
FY22, driven by strong revenue [Total Operating Revenue-- 20% increase
over FY22, $3.4B across all service lines (state, NEC, long-distance)]
and cost containment

Our FY23 Short-Term Incentive Plan drove and is directly tied to
these results:

Delight our customers: Measured by Customer Satisfaction
Index (in line with expectations given business conditions, but 0.4
points lower than aggressive threshold; no award)

Drive Transformation: Measured by minimizing Amtrak
Caused Delays eliminating  50K minutes of FY23 delay (14 minutes per
10K train miles which was better than targets set)

Grow the Business: Measured by lowering Adjusted
Operating loss ( $90M better than target)

Resulted in award for company performance of  88% which
was 22% lower than the average market award of  110%

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Our 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan (FY21-FY23) was also directly
tied to these results and was an aggressive plan set during the depths
of COVID when recovery was uncertain; despite this, Amtrak achieved
results exceeding all but one target:

Drive Transformation: Measured by delivering more trains
to more places (3.2M more riders than target and 17M more riders than
FY21) and efficiently deploying more capital with internal workforce
which excludes large purchases (was within 5% of target over the 3-year
period and more than $1.5B more capital than the prior 3 fiscal years)

Grow the Business: Measured by returning the NEC to
profitability since COVID ( $165M higher than target and $475M in more
income than FY21)

Resulted in award for company performance of  111% which
was 1% lower than the average market award of  112%

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Alternatives
Congress expects Amtrak to improve service, increase productivity
and maximize resources. Our incentive programs, like those of Publicly
Traded Companies and other Government Sponsored Enterprises, support
improved performance, reducing costs, and attracting and retaining the
talent needed to deliver on these goals and is at risk if the company
or individual underperforms.
Alternatives considered included continuing salary increases based
on cost-of-living adjustments which are unrelated to performance, and
maintaining a retiree healthcare and pension plan which are not tied to
performance, more costly for Amtrak and taxpayers, and not aligned with
talent needs. For the following reasons Amtrak and the Board agreed
with Congress's recommendation to move more compensation to at risk and
tied to the company's and individual performance:

Marketplace: 100% of companies offer similar at-risk pay
programs with only 10%-20% offering legacy rewards unrelated to
performance (retiree healthcare and pension plans).

Talent Needs:  85% of recent senior leaders were hired
from for-profit public and private companies where nearly all had
incentive compensation and most did not have pension or retiree health
care benefits; new employees seek growth driven by their performance
and are not asking or seeking long-term rewards like retiree health
care and pensions, given employees now change jobs every 4-5 years on
average.

Cost Efficient: Closing pension and retiree health
benefits saved nearly $470 million in debt and $1.3 billion in future
benefit payments. If these benefits had continued, these numbers would
be closer to $800 million in debt and $2.2 billion in future benefits
payments.

Stakeholder Interest: In the Passenger Railroad
Investment and Improvement Act (PRIIA) of 2008, Congress encouraged
Amtrak to develop a pay for performance incentive program for Amtrak
management employees (Sec. 223). Additionally, the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that Amtrak adopt a pay for
performance system in which compensation is tied to achieving goals.

Question 2. How does the Amtrak Board consider annual operating
losses and net losses, and the proportionality of bonus awards, when
those awards are necessarily funded by Federal taxpayers?
Answer. Congress expects Amtrak to improve service, increase
productivity, and maximize resources. Our incentive programs, like
those of Publicly Traded Companies and other Government Sponsored
Enterprises, support improved performance, reduced costs, and attract
and retain the talent needed to deliver on these goals, and put
incentives at risk if the company or individual underperforms.
Like its comparator companies, Amtrak leverages incentive plans to
place the largest focus (weight) for company performance on improved
financial performance and the remaining focus on key customer service
and operations metrics within Amtrak's Strategic Blueprint that drive
enterprise value that will benefit long-term financial performance.
Annual Operating Losses and Net Losses
In FY23 Amtrak delivered meaningfully improved performance with
regard to annual operating losses and net losses:

Adjusted Operating Losses:  $130M improvement over FY22,
driven by strong revenue [Total Operating Revenue-- 20% increase over
FY22, $3.4B across all service lines (state, NEC, long-distance)] and
cost containment].

Net Losses: $77M improvement over FY22, driven by strong
revenue [Total Operating Revenue-- 20% increase over FY22, $3.4B across
all service lines (state, NEC, long-distance)] and cost containment.
+  Amtrak delivered improvement of net losses greater than the
majority of passenger transportation companies in their comparator
group (JetBlue, Frontier, SkyWest, and Hawaiian Airlines).
+  The majority of passenger transportation companies in Amtrak's
comparator group operated as well with Net Losses in 2022 and 2023
(JetBlue, Spirit, Frontier, and Hawaiian Airlines) with financial
awards up to 400% higher than Amtrak despite two of those companies
worsening their net loss position (SkyWest, Hawaiian Airlines).
+  Of note, those passenger transportation companies, unlike
Amtrak, are not responsible for much of the costs related to facilities
that are present on Amtrak's financial statements.

Our FY23 Short-Term Incentive Plan drove and is directly tied to
these results:

Grow the Business: Measured by lowering Adjusted
Operating loss ( $90M better than target) making up the majority of the
weight of our short-term incentive plan.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Our 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan (FY21-FY23) is also directly tied
to these results and was an aggressive plan set during the depths of
COVID when recovery was uncertain; despite this, Amtrak:

Grow the Business: Measured by returning the NEC to
profitability since COVID ( $165M higher than target and $475M in more
income than FY21).

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Proportionality of Bonus Awards
Amtrak's at-risk incentive targets are largely informed through
comparison to market comparators of similar industry and size and
generally set at competitive levels recognizing:

For our Executive Leadership Team current target awards
are set at below market levels approximating not-for-profit status
( 40% below for-profit comparators) despite our business mix between
for-profit and for service may indicate  20% below for-profit
comparators as more appropriate.

Considerable direct savings of moving from non-
performance, non-market based awards of retiree healthcare and pension
to performance, market-based awards to improve performance, lower
costs, and retain the talent needed to deliver on Amtrak's aggressive
goals (e.g., closing pension and retiree health benefits saved nearly
$470 million in debt and $1.3 billion in future benefit payments; if
these programs had continued, these numbers would be closer to$800
million in debt and $2.2 billion in future benefits payments) before
considering the indirect savings through improved company performance
and talent attraction and retention.

Amtrak's incentive payments are at levels below market
despite delivering improved net losses at higher levels than the
majority of passenger airlines in our comparator group who operate with
net losses.

Question 3. How does FRA provide oversight, if any, of Amtrak bonus
awards through the annual Federal grant process or other means?
Answer. The FRA is aware that Amtrak uses federal funds for bonuses
paid to employees. The FRA has full oversight of the activities for
which annual grants are used. FRA grant agreements impose Federal
Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 31.2 cost principles requirements on
Amtrak under which bonuses are eligible expenditures. Amtrak, via the
single audit process, submits the population of expenditures for which
federal funds were used to our external auditor. Our external auditor
and the Amtrak OIG both audit the calculation of bonuses if/when paid.

Question 4. How are the Amtrak Board and FRA encouraging efforts to
reduce operating losses and net losses while honoring applicable legal
requirements to operate Amtrak services?
Answer. Amtrak's Board sets the overall strategy and priorities for
the Corporation and approves the company's Annual Operating Plan, Five
Year Plans and other documents which establish the goals and key
metrics for Amtrak, including Amtrak's Adjusted Operating Loss. These
plans continue to set forth reductions in operating losses associated
with our train operations and improved financial performance.
Representatives of FRA sit on Amtrak's Board as representatives of the
Secretary of Transportation, and through that role, they have the
ability to influence, along with the other Board members, Amtrak's
approach to operating losses while honoring applicable legal
requirements to operate services.

Question 5. What alternative incentive structures to improve Amtrak
service and profitability could the Amtrak Board of Directors provide
to executives?
Answer. Please refer to the answer to Question 1 for a
comprehensive response to this question.

Question 6. Amtrak Board of Directors meetings are held behind
closed doors.
Question 6.a. Would the Board of Directors be willing to make its
meetings and minutes available to the public? If not, why?
Answer. As Amtrak is subject to the Freedom of Information Act, we
regularly make meeting minutes available to the public upon request.

Question 6.b. Would the Board be willing to annually make public
all executive bonuses? If not, why?
Answer. Amtrak has disclosed executive compensation, including
incentive pay, on its website. We will continue to post this
information annually.

Question 6.c. Do the taxpayers who subsidized Amtrak's annual
losses not deserve transparency with regards to Amtrak's business?
Answer. As a company operated and managed as a for-profit
corporation that relies on federal funding, Amtrak is and aims to be
appropriately transparent about its decisions and the information it
makes available to the public through various reports to the FRA and
Congress and in response to requests from the public. The Board agrees
that our work should be transparent to the public and endeavors to
achieve this while protecting the various deliberative and commercial
matters that need to remain confidential.

Question 7. To comply with state statutes, senior state employee
salaries must be publicly disclosed. Regarding State Supported Routes,
this disclosure requirement provides transparency for a key component
of the costs of providing passenger rail services. Amtrak, however,
does not similarly disclose the salaries it pays its employees.
What steps are necessary to take to apply a consistent standard for
public disclosure of salaries across Amtrak and state-government
personnel?
Answer. As noted previously, Amtrak has always disclosed the annual
compensation of its executives and will continue to do so.

Question to Anthony Coscia, Chair of the Board, National Railroad
Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), from Hon. Steve Cohen

Food and Beverage Service
Question 1. You have publicly stated that the Amtrak Board supports
long-distance passenger rail service and its expansion. Passengers on
the long-distance system east of the Mississippi River have complained
that the food provided is unhealthy and of poor quality, that the
equipment is filthy, and the onboard staff is demoralized.
How does this reflect Amtrak's commitment to long-distance service?
Answer. As I have said before, Amtrak's Long-Distance routes
provide vital links to communities across the country, and we are
continually working to enhance those routes. Addressing each of these
three topics--food offerings, cleanliness of rolling stock, and
employee morale--in turn:
Food & Beverage--We've been actively working to improve food &
beverage service on Eastern long-distance routes in recent months, and
plan to continue that effort. Major steps have included:

Restoration of traditional dining to two Silver Service
routes: Following a successful pilot program, Amtrak in June of 2023
initiated a switch from ``flexible dining'' (hot, ready-to-serve meals
that first class passengers can enjoy in their compartments or in a
communal dining/lounge area) to ``traditional dining'' (hot, chef-
prepared meals, enjoyed in a dining car with table service) for first
class/sleeper car passengers on the Silver Meteor and the Silver Star
(both New York-Miami, via different routes). On both routes,
traditional dining is also available to coach class passengers (as a
fixed-price add-on) on a limited, ``first come, first served'' basis.

Initiation of ``flexible-plus'' dining on the Lake Shore
Limited: In April of 2024, the Long-Distance Lake Shore Limited
(Boston/New York-Chicago) began providing ``flexible-plus'' dinner
service to first class/sleeper car passengers as part of a pilot
program. (The service is also available to coach class customers for an
additional charge.) Flexible-plus dining uses the same ready-to-serve
meals as flexible dining, but those meals are plated to improve
presentation, and are served in a dining car featuring both table
service and table fixings (e.g., linens, silverware rolls, and
flowers). The goal of the pilot is to improve upon standard flexible
dining without incurring additional (incremental) labor costs; we plan
to expand that pilot to the Texas Eagle.

Restoration of a dining car to typical Crescent consists:
Beginning in June of 2024, first class passengers on the Crescent (New
York-Atlanta) have been able to enjoy flexible-style meals in a
Viewliner II dining car. (In recent years, the standard Crescent
consist had included only an Amfleet cafe car.) To be clear, there has
been no change to meal type--only to rolling stock.

Long-distance menu upgrades--All on-board menus
(traditional, flexible, cafe car, etc.) are routinely re-evaluated, and
adjusted on a rolling basis with the goal of continuous improvement; as
promised in Amtrak's response to the recommendations of the independent
Food & Beverage Working Group (FBWG), these adjustments reflect what we
learn from ``platform calls'' that bring frontline employees and
managers together to discuss issues relating to food and beverage
service. Notably, both flexible and traditional long-distance menus
include a growing number of healthy, high-quality options; all fourteen
overnight routes offer at least one lunch or dinner option that is
healthy (e.g., oven-roasted Atlantic salmon served with grains and
vegetables) and at least one that is vegetarian (e.g., plant-based
kofta kebabs).

All these initiatives have resulted in significant positive
feedback from both customers and employees. For example, the president
and CEO of the Rail Passengers Association said [https://
www.railpassengers.org/happening-now/news/blog/silver-services-latest-
to-get-traditional-dining/] that the restoration of traditional dining
to Silver Service trains was ``good news'' that offered passengers an
Eastern version of Western routes' ``highly popular service'';
similarly, he called [https://mailchi.mp/narprail/hotline1352] the
recent changes to Crescent dining ``incredibly welcome news.''
Looking ahead, we are committed to continuing to improve food and
beverage offerings in a way consistent with our congressionally-
prescribed mission and goals, which include a directive to ``maximize
the benefits of Federal investments'' in Amtrak by, among other
efforts, ``offering food service that meets the needs of [our]
customers'' and ``controlling or reducing management and operating
cost.'' Notably, our FY25 grant request specifically seeks $27 million
for ``Food & Beverage Service Improvements'' above and beyond our base
needs. Assuming that base needs are fully met, if Congress provides
these additional resources, we will be able to advance ``actions that
were favorably discussed in Amtrak's response to recent Food & Beverage
Working Group (FBWG) recommendations, but for which necessary funding
is not currently available''--potentially including further expansion
of traditional dining.
Cleanliness of Rolling Stock--Amtrak is taking a number of actions
to improve cleanliness onboard trains and equipment condition overall.
New carwashes are being installed at major maintenance facilities,
including three that maintain Eastern long-distance trains (New Orleans
and Boston this summer, to be followed by Chicago). The company is
changing its organizational structure to drive improved onboard
cleaning at maintenance facilities and at intermediate stations where
trains make longer stops. Interior refreshes are being performed on the
passenger car fleets we operate on Eastern long-distance routes: a
refresh of Amfleet II cars has been completed, a Superliner refresh is
underway, and refreshes of Viewliner I cars will soon begin.
Employee Morale--I believe that Amtrak's employee morale is
actually quite positive overall. Amtrak's workforce has faced many
challenges and undergone a huge transformation as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic and the large number of new employees hired over the
last three years: about 10,000, which is over 40% of Amtrak's
workforce. Providing all these new employees with the skills and
coaching they need, and addressing the corporate culture issues
associated with adding so many employees who are new to Amtrak (and in
most cases new to railroading as well) is still a work in progress.
Nonetheless, Amtrak's new generation of employees is already proving to
be a huge asset to the company, contributing to a significant
improvement in safety and bringing great enthusiasm to Amtrak's
workplaces. In August, Amtrak will begin an Employee Engagement Survey,
in which all employees will be invited to participate, to help us
identify employees' concerns and ways to improve employee engagement,
working conditions, and training.
One factor that may impact the morale of employees who work onboard
our trains is that, while Amtrak has reached agreements with the labor
unions representing 80% of non-management employees that provide for
increased pay and new benefits, the company has not yet been able to
reach new agreements with the unions that represent conductors and
onboard service employees. Those employees continue to be governed by
their old agreements pursuant to the Railway Labor Act. I am hopeful
that agreements will be reached soon.

Questions to Julie A. White, Deputy Secretary for Multimodal
Transportation, North Carolina Department of Transportation, from Hon.
Henry C. ``Hank'' Johnson, Jr.

Question 1. Congratulations on receiving a planning grant to
connect Charlotte to Atlanta. I was glad to see this news. It would
create a new high-speed rail service between Charlotte and Atlanta,
with potential stops at Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport,
Augusta, and Athens.
Question 1.a. Can you please discuss how we can successfully
execute the vision of the Southeast Corridor Commission without secure,
long-term funding?
Answer. The funding provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
is a great first step to start building segments of corridors that have
been included in the Southeast Corridor Commission's vision. However,
continued secure, long-term federal funding is needed to build out the
Southeast Corridor and other corridors in the region. Additional
appropriations are needed at minimum, and formula funding would be
ideal so our member states can more confidently plan and implement
individual elements of the Vision. Without sustained funding, the
system cannot be delivered in a predictable timeframe.

Question 1.b. What will happen to these projects if there is no
funding?
Answer. The Corridor Identification and Development Program
establishes a method to plan and provide preliminary engineering on
these projects. But without continued appropriations and support at the
Federal level, these projects cannot be developed by states alone. The
magnitude of the funding required and the need to align policies and
move travelers across multiple state lines, across agencies, and
multiple entities make developing corridors without Federal funds
extremely challenging and different from other modes of transportation.

Question 2. Georgia was awarded the Corridor ID grant from the
Federal Railroad Administration to fund the development of a passenger
line connecting Atlanta to Savannah. The proposed corridor could
greatly improve connectivity and accessibility with potential stops in
Athens, Augusta, and Macon.
In your experience with the Southeast Corridor Commission, how will
the Commission or our state work with regional partners to support this
development?
Answer. GDOT is a member of the Southeast Corridor Commission. To
date, with the GDOT representatives' help, the Commission has developed
a regional rail plan, economic impact report, and development strategy
for the region (see https://www.southeastcorridor-commission.org/). The
Atlanta to Savannah corridor certainly is an element of that regional
vision. The Commission can help communicate the importance of the
connection in our collective vision. It should also be noted that
corridors work best as a network that provides more potential
destinations to its users. A Savannah to Atlanta corridor may perform
well on its own, but the corridor will perform much better if there are
additional high performance connections beyond Savannah to the south
and beyond Atlanta to the northeast and northwest. Also, as it is
currently organized, the Southeast Corridor Commission cannot receive
Federal funds directly (as it is not established as a Compact pursuant
the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997). However, the
Commission can continue to support members in their efforts to pursue
funding. Information sharing between member states and letters of
support can also be provided. The Federal Railroad Administration
considers the Southeast Corridor Commission's vision as important in
making funding decisions on passenger rail in the southeast.

Question 3. In your testimony, you mentioned the inauguration of
new passenger rail services, such as the Borealis route from
Minneapolis to Chicago.
Could you speak on how these new services are impacting regional
connectivity and economic development? Are you seeing the results
predicted?
Answer. In North Carolina we have seen significant growth in
ridership on our rail services from a wide demographic of users.
Students, retirees, the mobility impaired, families, and those
traveling for business purposes chose rail as a way to use their travel
time productively and safely. Economic development activity is
occurring at station sites both in rural and urban areas, such as in
Raleigh with new high rises, retail, restaurant, hotel and
entertainment venues within walking distance, and in Kannapolis where a
sports venue, a research campus, residential and other related
development are occurring around the station.
