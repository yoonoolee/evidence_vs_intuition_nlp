SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Economic Development,
Public Buildings, and Emergency Management
FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public
Buildings, and Emergency Management
RE:      LSubcommittee Hearing on ``From Headquarters
Building to Field Offices: Examining the FBI's Real Estate
Needs and Strategy''
_______________________________________________________________________

I. PURPOSE

The Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings,
and Emergency Management of the Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure will meet on Tuesday, April 10, 2024, at 10:00
a.m. ET in 2167 of the Rayburn House Office Building to receive
testimony at a hearing entitled, ``From Headquarters Building
to Field Offices: Examining the FBI's Real Estate Needs and
Strategy.'' The purpose of the hearing is to examine the
Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI's or Bureau's) vast real
estate portfolio of field offices and associated resident
agencies, Headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C., and other
FBI facilities across the country. Members will receive
testimony from witnesses from the General Services
Administration (GSA) and the FBI.

II. BACKGROUND

In addition to the FBI Headquarters building in Washington,
D.C., which is under GSA's custody and control, the FBI has
multiple Federally owned facilities in the FBI's custody and
control.\1\ Some of these include the Bureau's campus in
Quantico, Virginia, which houses the FBI Academy; the FBI
Laboratory Division; the Operational Technology Division; and
the Hostage Rescue Team.\2\ The Bureau's presence spans across
the country from its data center in Pocatello, Idaho, to their
presence at the United States Army's Redstone Arsenal in
Huntsville, Alabama.\3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The FBI also has a network of 56 field offices (9,039,204
rentable square feet (RSF) in total) located in metropolitan
areas across the country. These offices are where the FBI
carries out investigations, assesses local and regional crime
threats, and works with law enforcement and other partners on
cases and operations.\4\ In addition to field offices, there
are more than 350 satellite offices, or resident agencies
(3,477,760 RSF), located in smaller towns or cities.\5\ These
function as a part of field offices and allow for broader
regional coverage.\6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While the FBI has custody and control of some of their
owned locations, the Bureau relies on GSA to meet all of their
space requirements for both field offices and resident
agencies.\7\ Nine FBI field offices are located in Federal
buildings, which are owned by the Federal Government and under
the custody and control of GSA, like the offices in New York
City, New York, and Los Angeles, California.\8\ The vast
majority of FBI field offices, however, are housed in privately
owned buildings where GSA has procured a lease for the FBI.\9\

Following the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 and
accelerating after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the FBI took
steps to transform its field operations, including creating new
field offices requiring space.\10\ ``We hired more agents and
analysts, we established more Joint Terrorism Task Forces, we
created new Field Intelligence Groups, so we simply needed more
room for our people and partners and workplaces more conducive
to sharing information,'' said then-Assistant Director Patrick
Findlay of the FBI Facilities and Logistics Services
Division.\11\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
After September 11th, GSA and the FBI procured leased space
across the country to meet the mission requirements of the
FBI.\12\ For example, between September 2001 and November 2009,
16 new FBI offices were completed and 15 more were under
contract or had been authorized by Congress.\13\ At the time,
the FBI indicated that their field office program was the
largest lease-construct program in the history of the Federal
Government.\14\ The FBI has stated that it costs approximately
$45 million to move and replicate a FBI field office in a new
location.\15\ In many instances, GSA will negotiate a
succeeding lease with the incumbent lessor because it is cost
prohibitive to move and replicate a FBI field office in a new
location.\16\ As a result, GSA often negotiates with incumbent
lessors for the FBI to remain in existing field office
locations.\17\ Therefore, the FBI, on average, has remained in
leased locations, procured after September 11th, for
approximately 17 years.\18\

III. COMMITTEE SUPPORT OF PURCHASE OPTIONS FOR FBI FIELD
OFFICES

The taxpayer potentially pays billions of dollars in rent
payments unnecessarily when the Federal Government has long-
term space requirements with no option to acquire the building.
According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), in
these instances, the option to acquire a building where the
government has a leasehold interest can be both financially
advantageous and provide greater security to the tenant
agency.\19\ Yet, the FBI field offices are typically 15 or 20-
year leases where GSA is recommending replacement 20-year
leases without any options for negotiated discounted purchase
options.\20\ As a result, the taxpayer has likely paid for
these properties many times over and will do so again when new
20-year leases are executed. For example, for one lease
authorized for an FBI field office in 2022, the taxpayer paid
$62 million over the term of the previous lease and by the end
of the replacement lease term, the taxpayer will have paid an
additional $92 million.\21\

During the 117th Congress, H.R. 2220 passed with
overwhelmingly bipartisan support, to amend title 40, United
States Code, to modify the treatment of certain bargain-price
options to purchase at less than fair market value, and for
other purposes (P. L. 117-257).\22\ President Biden signed the
legislation into law on December 21, 2022.\23\ This legislation
conformed the treatment of certain bargain-price options and
options to purchase at less than fair market with the Office of
Management and Budget's (OMB) requirements for operating
leases, under Circular A-11 Appendix B.\24\ Importantly,
purchase options have the potential of saving taxpayer dollars
on long-term space needs.\25\ This legislation intended to
allow GSA to negotiate below fair market value purchase options
with private sector lessors while also meeting the budget
scoring requirements for Federal operating lease
transactions.\26\ Despite enactment of H.R. 2220, OMB continues
to prohibit GSA from negotiating these purchase options into
leases.\27\ On May 10, 2023, Committee Chairman Graves and
Subcommittee Chairman Perry wrote to OMB Director Young raising
these questions and concerns.\28\ To date, OMB has not
responded to the correspondence.

IV. COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT OF FBI REAL PROPERTY

ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE (COMMITTEE)

Pursuant to 40 U.S.C. Sec.  3307, the Committee's approval
for new GSA Capital Investment and Lease Program prospectus is
required when the total cost of a capital project or lease
exceeds the current threshold of $3.613 million per year.\29\
Since fiscal year (FY) 2019, the Committee has authorized 1.73
million RSF of space for FBI field offices costing $67.4
million annually or $1.3 billion over the terms of the leases
(20 years).\30\ Pending before the Committee for consideration
is an additional 797,737 RSF costing $39.5 million annually or
$790 million over the lease terms.\31\

Since FY 2022, GSA has submitted twelve lease prospectuses
to the Committee and the Senate Committee on Environment and

pending Committee approval and five are pending approval by
Committees in both the House and Senate.\33\

FOREIGN OWNERSHIP

In January 2017, GAO published a report entitled, ``GSA
Should Inform Tenant Agencies When Leasing High-Security Space
from Foreign Owners.'' \34\ In the report, GAO found that GSA
had procured foreign-owned leased space for six FBI field
offices and three Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) field
offices.\35\ At the time of the report, GAO determined that
some of the high-security lease space GSA had procured was
owned by companies based in countries including Canada, China,
Israel, Japan, and South Korea.\36\ However, GAO was unable to
identify ownership information for about one-third of GSA's
1,406 high-security leases as of March 2016, because ownership
information was not readily available for all buildings.\37\

On December 31, 2020, the President signed into law the
Secure Federal Leases from Espionage and Suspicious
Entanglements Act (P.L. 116-276).\38\ The legislation sought to
address many of GAO's recommendations by imposing disclosure
requirements regarding the foreign ownership, particularly
``beneficial ownership'' of prospective lessors of ``high-
security space'' which is property leased to the Federal
Government having a security level of three or higher, as well
as existing lessors of such space.\39\ The Act applies to any
lease or lease novation entered into six months after the date
of the enactment of the Act.\40\

V. FBI HEADQUARTERS UPDATE

Per language in both the Consolidated Appropriations Acts,
2022 and Consolidated Appropriations Acts, 2023 GSA evaluated
and considered the following sites to house the next FBI
Headquarters: Greenbelt, Maryland; Landover, Maryland; and
Springfield, Virginia.\41\ On November 9, 2023, GSA announced
that Greenbelt, Maryland, had been selected as the location for
the new FBI Headquarters.\42\ Furthermore, per the Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2022 GSA is required to submit a report to
the Committee which satisfies the requirements of the
prospectus process found in section 3307(b) of title 40, United
States Code and receive authorization of the prospectus prior
to spending appropriated funds.\43\ The Further Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2024 provided an additional $200 million
for a new consolidated FBI HQ.\44\

On March 28, 2024, GSA submitted to the Committee the
report required by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022.
The report proposes a 2.1 million RSF consolidated headquarters
for the FBI in Greenbelt, Maryland, consolidating the J. Edgar
Hoover building and eight leased locations.\45\

Following the December 12, 2023, Subcommittee hearing
entitled, ``Ensuring Transparency in the Federal Government: An
Examination of GSA's Site Selection for the FBI Headquarters,''
Committee Chairman Graves and Subcommittee Chairman Perry sent
letters to GSA Administrator Carnahan and FBI Director Wray
requesting copies of documents and communications pertaining to
the site evaluation and selection of the Greenbelt, Maryland,
site to house the next FBI Headquarters.\46\ To date, GSA and
the FBI have partially responded to Chairman Graves' and
Subcommittee Chairman Perry's correspondence and provided
initial document productions.\47\ While both GSA and the FBI
indicated that they will provide copies of documents and
communications responsive to the Committee's request as they
become available, to date neither the FBI nor GSA has made
subsequent productions to the Committee.

Additionally, the President's FY 2025 Budget Request
proposes the capitalization of a new Federal Capital Revolving
Fund (FCRF) with a $10 billion mandatory appropriation.\48\ The
proposed FCRF would fund civilian Federal agencies' largest
Federal real property projects, such as construction,
renovations, and purchases, in one appropriation.\49\ Annual
discretionary repayments by purchasing agencies would replenish
the FCRF and would be available until expended to fund
additional capital projects.\50\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the FBI Greenbelt, Maryland, Headquarters project, the
FY 2025 Budget proposed a $3.5 billion allocation from the
FCRF, to be repaid by the FBF in 15 annual amounts of $233
million.\51\ The FCRF funding would be paired with
approximately $845 million in available GSA enacted
appropriations to support the acquisition and construction of
the FBI Greenbelt, Maryland Headquarters project.\52\
Additionally, GSA and FBI continue efforts to identify a
Federally owned location in Washington, D.C., to support a
presence of approximately 750 to 1,000 FBI personnel that would
support day-to-day FBI engagement with the United States
Department of Justice's headquarters, the White House,
Congress, and other law enforcement agencies.\53\ The Biden
Administration plans to use existing balances in the FBI's
account previously appropriated for the new headquarters effort
to build a downtown Washington, D.C., location to support the
FBI's mission.\54\

It is important to note that Congress has not authorized or
provided funding to the FCRF when it was previously proposed by
the Trump Administration or the Biden Administration. OMB
continues to propose the creation of this new fund but fails to
indicate how the initial $10 billion in seed-money would be
funded nor why a new fund is needed given the existence of
GSA's Federal Buildings Fund.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SCOTT PERRY OF  PENNSYLVANIA,
CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC
BUILDINGS, AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

Mr. Perry. I want to begin by thanking our witnesses for
being here today to discuss the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's current real estate footprint and space
strategy.
The FBI has a massive real estate portfolio across this
country, comprised of a headquarters building in downtown
Washington, DC; 56 field offices; and more than 350 satellite
offices, also known as resident agencies, under its field
office umbrella. Together, the network of field offices and
resident agencies represent more than 12 million rentable
square feet of space.
The FBI also controls the campus at Quantico, Virginia; a
data center in Pocatello, Idaho; and has substantial presence
at the United States Army's Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville,
Alabama. And several years ago, GSA completed construction of a
new records management facility in Winchester, Virginia.
Currently, we have GSA prospectuses for FBI leases pending
committee approval that would account for nearly 800,000 square
feet of space, costing $40 million annually, or nearly $800
million over the terms of the proposed leases. And we recently
received the official proposal for a new FBI headquarters
building in Greenbelt, Maryland.
The bottom line is the FBI's space footprint is massive and
costly, and so, it is critical that we ensure the FBI's real
estate is right-sized, and that we understand how each proposal
for space fits into an overall strategy.
Now, some of the FBI's space proposals simply don't make
sense to me or us. For example, despite the FBI decreasing the
number of people working out of a new headquarters, the current
headquarters proposal maintains the same 2.1 million square
feet of space as was proposed in 2016. So, less people, but the
same amount of square footage. And the price has ballooned. The
cost went from under $3 billion to now well over $4.3 billion,
and that is on top of the FBI proposing to maintain a
headquarters footprint in the District of Columbia, as well.
To make matters worse, the Office of Management and Budget
proposes to fund most of this project through the creation of a
new Federal Capital Revolving Fund, or an FCRF, that would need
$10 billion in seed money.
The FBI testified before this subcommittee a few months
ago, in December of last year, that the Greenbelt site, in
their view, created challenges because of the site size and the
presence of wetlands. And I suspect these challenges also
significantly increased construction costs. At the hearing in
December, the Bureau also raised concern about GSA's site
evaluation and selection process due to former GSA Public
Buildings Commissioner Nina Albert going against the
recommendation of the nonpartisan site selection panel and
selecting a site owned by the Washington Metropolitan Area
Transit Authority, or WMATA, her former employer.
Following this hearing, Chairman Graves and I sent letters
continuing to inquire into this decision, which included
document production requests to both GSA and the FBI. And while
I appreciate GSA and the FBI responding to our letter and
providing an initial document production, I would like to know
the status of efforts to identify and produce all--produce
all--responsive documents to this committee. That would include
copies of communications between GSA, the FBI, and other
administration officials. You received the oversight request 5
months ago and have had more than enough time to fully respond
and comply with the committee's requests.
Returning to a point I raised previously, we currently have
lease prospectuses for FBI field offices pending before the
committee. And how could we be expected to sincerely and
completely evaluate that without all the information?
After the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and continuing after
the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the FBI's space requirements were
adjusted, resulting in an expansion of its field operations. In
recent years, the full committee has been asked to approve new
and replacement leases for many of these field offices, yet it
has been unclear how GSA and the FBI are assessing ongoing
space needs based on current threats and mission.
The taxpayer winds up paying for many of these leased
buildings several times over without any equity accruing, even
after the taxpayer invests tens of millions of dollars for
special build-outs in these buildings. However, GSA continues
to be stifled from even negotiating discounted purchase options
in these leases, despite overwhelming passage of legislation
authorizing the GSA to do exactly that.
Now, today, we have an opportunity here to make sure we
don't overbuild and overlease for the FBI and save the
taxpayers, potentially, billions of dollars without
compromising mission. I hope today we can get to some answers
as the committee prepares to review any proposal for a new FBI
headquarters and pending and future FBI office lease
prospectuses.
[Mr. Perry's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Scott Perry, a Representative in Congress
from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and Chairman, Subcommittee on
Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management
The FBI has a massive real estate portfolio across this country,
comprised of a headquarters building in downtown Washington, D.C., 56
field offices and more than 350 satellite offices, also known as
``resident agencies,'' under its field office umbrella. Together the
network of field offices and resident agencies represents more than 12
million rentable square feet of space. The FBI also controls the campus
in Quantico, Virginia, a data center in Pocatello, Idaho, and has a
substantial presence at the United States Army's Redstone Arsenal in
Huntsville, Alabama, and, several years ago, GSA completed construction
of a new records management facility in Winchester, Virginia.
Currently, we have GSA prospectuses for FBI leases pending
Committee approval that would account for nearly 800,000 square feet of
space, costing $40 million annually, or nearly $800 million over the
terms of the proposed leases. And, we recently received the official

The bottom line is--the FBI's space footprint is massive and
costly. And, so it is critical that we ensure the FBI's real estate is
right-sized and that we understand how each proposal for space fits
into an overall strategy.
But, some of the FBI's space proposals simply don't make sense. For
example, despite the FBI decreasing the number of people working out of
a new headquarters, the current headquarters proposal maintains the
same 2.1 million square feet of space as was proposed in 2016. And, the
price has ballooned. The cost went from under $3 billion to now well
over $4.3 billion and that is on top of the FBI proposing to maintain a
headquarters footprint in the District of Columbia.
To make matters even worse, the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) proposes to fund most of this project through the creation of a

I hope today we can get some answers as the Committee prepares to

FBI field office lease prospectuses.

Mr. Perry. The Chair now recognizes Ranking Member Titus
for 5 minutes for her opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DINA TITUS OF NEVADA, RANKING MEMBER,
SUBCOMMITTEE ON  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT,  PUBLIC BUILDINGS,  AND
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

Ms. Titus. Thank you, Chairman Perry, for holding another
hearing on the FBI's real estate footprint.
I appreciate the witnesses being here. It is especially
nice to see you, Mr. Doomes; you are looking good.
At our last hearing on the FBI in December of 2023, this
subcommittee examined plans for a new, consolidated, suburban
headquarters for the FBI. Since that time, GSA has submitted to
this committee a report on the construction of a new
headquarters building, so, I look forward to discussing this
report with Mr. Doomes, our GSA witness.
I am interested in receiving more information on GSA's
procurement strategy and funding needs, particularly on how GSA
is going to provide the FBI with the secure, modern facility
that it needs while also ensuring efficient use of taxpayer
dollars.
I also look forward to hearing from our FBI witness, Mr.
Dimos, about the FBI's broader real estate strategy.
After 9/11, as you heard from the chairman, the FBI's
mission expanded dramatically. We had 16 new FBI offices
completed, and 15 more were under contract or had been
authorized by Congress. At the time, the FBI indicated that
their field office program was the largest lease-construct
program in the history of the Federal Government.
Today, the FBI occupies 5 headquarters buildings, 56 field
offices, and 350 resident agency offices all across the
country, and the majority of these are under leases procured by
the GSA in privately owned buildings. It would be helpful to
know from the witnesses how many of the FBI leases will be
expiring within the next 5 years; second, whether there are
plans to consolidate and relocate offices; and third, how the
FBI will protect its data in co-located spaces and buildings
not owned by the Federal Government.
Finally, with these questions in mind, I would like to get
a sense of whether any of the FBI field office prospectuses
that have already been submitted to this committee will need to
be amended to accommodate the fluctuations we are seeing in the
real estate market.
So, again, I thank our witnesses for being here. I look
forward to today's discussion.
And I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[Ms. Titus' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Dina Titus, a Representative in Congress

Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the ranking member. The Chair
now recognizes the ranking member of the full committee, Mr.
Larsen, for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair. At today's
hearing, we will examine the FBI's real estate needs. I want to
thank the witnesses for participating in this hearing, which
comes less than 4 months after they both testified at a hearing
on the site selection process for a new headquarters building.
The FBI has a broad mission and mandate. The FBI combats
terrorism, espionage, cyber crime, public corruption, organized
crime, white collar and violent crimes. The FBI started to
transform its field operations following the Oklahoma City
bombing, and this work accelerated in the wake of the 9/11
terrorist attacks. To meet its post-9/11 mission, the FBI added
more than 12,000 staff and contract personnel and formed 653
State and local task forces.
The data collection needs expanded, and new facility
security requirements were implemented. The FBI's current 56
multitenant and stand-alone facilities across commercially
leased and federally owned facilities must accommodate data
storage, evidence storage, firearms storage, special equipment
and vehicle storage, command centers, SCIFs, and interview
rooms, all which require money and space.
Over the past few years, FBI facilities in Atlanta,
Phoenix, Houston, Cincinnati, and Seattle have been attacked. I
hope the witnesses will explain how GSA and the FBI are working
together to protect facilities, and the employees who work in
them, from domestic terrorism.
I also would like to know the potential impact on the FBI
staff and operational capabilities if a new headquarters
building is not built soon. The FBI has an important mission,
and its employees deserve safe, secure, and functional
workspaces. I look forward to discussing how this committee can
help ensure the FBI has the infrastructure that it needs today
and into its future.
With that, I yield back.
[Mr. Larsen of Washington's prepared statement follows:]

TESTIMONY OF ELLIOT D. DOOMES, COMMISSIONER, PUBLIC BUILDINGS
SERVICE, U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION;  AND NICHOLAS
DIMOS, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, FINANCE AND FACILITIES  DIVISION,
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

TESTIMONY OF ELLIOT D. DOOMES, COMMISSIONER, PUBLIC BUILDINGS
SERVICE, U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION

Mr. Doomes. Good morning, Chairman Perry, Ranking Member
Titus, Ranking Member Larsen, and distinguished members of the
subcommittee. My name is Elliot Doomes, and I am the
Commissioner of the Public Buildings Service at the U.S.
General Services Administration. Thank you for the opportunity
to testify today on how PBS supports the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's real estate needs and strategy.
Mr. Perry. Mr. Doomes, can you pull the mic kind of like
straight at you there?
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Doomes. GSA's intent is to deliver the highest quality
facilities for the FBI while maintaining our agency goals of
optimizing the Federal footprint.
GSA partners with Federal agencies like the FBI and
community stakeholders to meet our mission of providing real
estate solutions for the Federal Government at the best value
to the taxpayer. We accomplish this mission by implementing a
real estate portfolio strategy to prioritize investments that
make optimal use of federally owned facilities, disposing of
unneeded facilities, and implementing strategies that reduce
costs.
GSA drives our strategy forward in partnership with
agencies like the FBI to support their long-term mission. For
the FBI, our priorities are the construction of their new
headquarters and the support to acquire and administer their
field office operations.
PBS is fully committed to providing high-quality space for
the American taxpayer. GSA's fiscal year 2025 budget request
includes $1.6 billion for repair and alterations, of which $584
million is for major repairs and alterations, and a new request
for a $425 million optimization program that will allow GSA to
reconfigure and renovate Federal buildings to better utilize
space and to expedite the disposition of unneeded Federal
facilities. With full access to the Federal Buildings Fund, PBS
will be able to reconfigure and renovate core assets under
GSA's controls in efforts to right-size our Federal footprint
faster, while saving taxpayer dollars and supporting local
economies.
GSA leverages its expertise and best practices to support
the real estate mission requirements of the FBI. I will provide
two examples that illustrate how GSA has worked with the FBI to
shrink its footprint and better utilize existing federally
owned facilities.
First, in October 2020, the FBI was able to eliminate two
leases and reduce the total space needs by over 50,000 rentable
square feet in New York City by consolidating into the Javits
Federal Building. This consolidation resulted in lease cost
savings totaling $13 million annually.
Second, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, GSA renovated space
in the William J. Green, Jr., Federal Building to restack the
building and enhance security features, which in turn allowed
FBI to consolidate two existing leases into that space. This
consolidation eliminated the need for 31,000 rentable square
feet, with an annual reduction of $840,000 in rent.
In accordance with the Consolidated Appropriations Act of
Fiscal Year 2022, last month, GSA submitted a report on the
construction of a new suburban headquarters for the FBI in the
national capital region. The FBI headquarters suburban campus
will bring together employees from the Hoover Building and
eight leased locations across the national capital region for a
new, modern, and secure facility tailored to fully support the
FBI's national security, intelligence, and law enforcement
mission.
The report included a summary of the material provisions of
the construction and consolidation of the FBI in a new
headquarters facility, including all estimated costs associated
with site acquisition, design, construction, management and
inspection, and a description of the buildings and
infrastructure needed to complete the project.
Now that the relevant committees in both the House and the
Senate have received the headquarters report required by
Congress, GSA awaits the necessary approvals before acquiring
the Greenbelt, Maryland, site and commencing with design and
construction activities.
The FBI's space needs are not limited to the national
capital region. Multiple locations throughout the country are
experiencing significant challenges. Because the space
requirements of the FBI require significant tenant
improvements, GSA works closely with the agency to ensure
efficient use of space and cost effectiveness for taxpayers.
Currently, the FBI occupies 56 field offices across the
country, 47 of which are leased by GSA, totaling approximately
12.5 million rentable square feet. The remaining nine FBI field
offices are located in GSA federally owned facilities under
GSA's control. At these locations, the FBI pays rent that is
deposited into the Federal Buildings Fund, with the expectation
that the rent will be used to adequately maintain the
facilities that the FBI occupies. Providing GSA with full
access to the FBF is crucial to our mission of providing the
highest level of support to not only the FBI, but to other
Federal agencies.
In conclusion, GSA's mission is to provide the best value
in real estate, which means working with the agencies like the
FBI to deliver the functional and secure Federal facilities
that they need in order to fulfill their missions. GSA looks
forward to continuing to work with the FBI and this committee
on these important projects, and I look forward to answering
your questions.
[Mr. Doomes' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Elliot D. Doomes, Commissioner, Public Buildings
Service, U.S. General Services Administration
Good morning, Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and
distinguished Members of the Subcommittee. My name is Elliot Doomes,
and I am the Commissioner of the Public Buildings Service (``PBS'') at
the U.S. General Services Administration (``GSA''). I appreciate the
Committee's invitation to discuss how PBS supports the Federal Bureau
of Investigation's (``FBI'') real estate needs and strategy, and
provide an update on GSA's site selection for the FBI Headquarters
suburban campus since my testimony last December. GSA's intent is to
deliver the highest quality facilities for the FBI while maintaining
our agency goals of optimizing the federal footprint.
GSA partners with federal agencies like the FBI, community
stakeholders, and the real estate industry at large to meet our mission
of providing real estate solutions for the federal government at the
best value to the taxpayer. We can best accomplish this mission by
implementing our fundamental real estate portfolio strategy to
prioritize investments that make optimal use of federally-owned
facilities for which there are long-term agency requirements while
disposing of facilities the government no longer needs, and
implementing leasing strategies that optimize space and reduce costs.
GSA drives our portfolio strategy forward in partnership with agencies
like the FBI to support their mission over the long-term. For the FBI,
our priorities are the construction of their new headquarters and the
support required to acquire and administer the leases for many of their
56 field offices.
GSA is fully committed to providing high-quality space for the
American taxpayer. Each year, GSA submits a capital plan as a part of
the President's budget request that outlines strategic investments to
better meet the government's real estate needs. This year, GSA's FY
2025 budget submission includes $1.6 billion for repair and alterations
work, of which $584 million is for major repairs and alteration, and a
new request for a $425 million Optimization Program that will allow GSA
to reconfigure and renovate federal buildings to better utilize space
and to expedite the disposition of unneeded federal facilities. If this
request is approved, agencies like the FBI will benefit from our
Optimization Program that is designed to support their mission needs by
facilitating GSA's strategic divestiture of unneeded federally-owned
assets and reducing the reliance on leased space. This fund will allow
GSA to reconfigure and renovate core assets under GSA's jurisdiction,
custody, and control to support efforts to more efficiently utilize
these assets in response to the requirements of our client agencies.
With full access to the Federal Buildings Fund, GSA will be able to
right-size our federal footprint faster while saving taxpayer dollars
and supporting local economies with good paying jobs.
National Priorities Related to the FBI
GSA leverages its expertise and best practices to support the real
estate mission requirements of the FBI. I will describe some of the
unique challenges related to supporting the space and location
requirements for the FBI's mission, and provide some examples of where
GSA has worked with the FBI to consolidate several locations into one
at considerable savings to the taxpayer. I can assure this Committee
that my priority as the Commissioner of GSA's PBS is to deliver the
highest-quality real property solutions for agencies like the FBI at
the best value for the federal taxpayer.
It is helpful to highlight two examples where GSA worked with the
FBI to shrink its footprint and better utilize existing federally-owned
facilities. First, in October 2020, the FBI was able to eliminate two
leases and reduce its total space needs by over 50,000 Rentable Square
Footage (``RSF'') in New York City by consolidating into the Javits
Federal Building. This resulted in a lease cost savings totaling $13
million annually, and brought the FBI's total occupancy at the Javits
federal building up to 604,388 RSF. GSA continues to invest in that
space, with $37 million requested in FY 2025 to allow for needed fire
and life-safety improvements. Second, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
GSA renovated space in the William J. Green, Jr., Federal Building to
restack the building and enhance security features, which in turn
allowed the FBI to consolidate two existing leases into that space. The
first phase was completed in July 2021 and the second phase was
completed in February 2024. This consolidation eliminated the need for
31,000 RSF with an annual reduction of $840,000 in rent.
FBI Headquarters
The FBI is in dire need of a new headquarters facility. The FBI has
occupied the J. Edgar Hoover Building (the ``Hoover Building'') since
1974. However, as multiple studies have found and many members and
staff of this Committee have witnessed firsthand, the Hoover Building
is no longer able to support the FBI's long-term security, space, and
mission requirements. This 50-year-old facility is nearing the end of
its life cycle, and is exhibiting many signs of significant
deterioration. Moreover, the Hoover Building was not designed to meet
the modern mission requirements of the FBI. As our FBI colleagues have
indicated, the dispersion of FBI elements across several locations in
the National Capital Region (``NCR'') has created significant
management challenges and impedes the FBI's ability to respond to
emerging threats. This was true in 2011 when the process to examine the
need for a new building began, and the issues have only worsened since
that time.
As part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L. 117-
103), Congress directed GSA to select a new headquarters location for
the FBI from among three specified locations. GSA determined that
Greenbelt, Maryland was the site most advantageous for the government,
because it has the lowest overall cost to taxpayers of the three sites
that were considered; the site provides the best access to public
transportation for FBI employees and visitors as it is accessible to
both the Metro and commuter rails; it provides the government with
project schedule certainty; and, it offers the greatest opportunity for
the government's investment to positively impact the Washington, D.C.
region through sustainable and equitable development.
GSA ran a fair and transparent process, guided by the agency's best
practices in site selection. At every step, the GSA team worked to
carefully follow the process outlined publicly, and to make a decision
that best meets the needs of the FBI and the public for the long-term.
Consistent with our commitment to transparency, our agency's full site
selection decision and many other related documents associated with the
site selection process are publicly available on GSA's website.
FBI Prospectus Report
In accordance with Division E, Title V, Section 530 of the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L. 117-103), on March 28,
2024, GSA submitted a report, consistent with the requirements of
section 3307(b) of title 40, United States Code, on the construction of
a new suburban headquarters for the FBI in the NCR.
The FBI headquarters suburban campus will bring together employees
from the Hoover Building and eight leased locations across the NCR for
a new, modern, and secure facility tailored to fully support the FBI's
national security, intelligence, and law enforcement missions. The
report includes a summary of the material provisions of the
construction and consolidation of the FBI in a new headquarters
facility, including all of the estimated costs associated with site
acquisition, design, construction, management and inspection, and a
description of the buildings and infrastructure needed to complete the
project. Upon submission, GSA posted this report on our website in our
publicly available online prospectus library.
Now that the relevant committees in both the House and Senate have
received the headquarters report required by Congress, GSA awaits the
necessary approvals before acquiring the Greenbelt, Maryland site and
commencing with design and construction activities.
FBI Field Offices
The FBI's space needs are not limited to the NCR. Multiple
locations throughout the country are experiencing significant
challenges impeding the FBI's ability to rapidly respond to ever
changing threats, as highlighted by the U.S. Government Accountability
Office. Because the space requirements of the FBI require significant
tenant improvements, GSA is working with the agency in these locations
to ensure efficient use of space and cost effectiveness for the
taxpayers.
Currently, the FBI occupies 56 field offices across the country, 47
of which are leased by GSA, totaling approximately 12.5 million RSF.
The remaining nine FBI field offices are located in federally-owned
facilities under GSA's jurisdiction, custody, and control. At these
locations, the FBI pays GSA rent that is deposited into the Federal
Buildings Fund, with the expectation that this rent will be used to
adequately maintain the facilities that the FBI occupies. Providing GSA
with full access to the Federal Buildings Fund is crucial to our
mission of providing the highest level of support to not only the FBI,
but to all of our customer agencies.
GSA requires both funding and approval to deliver high-quality
space in federally-owned facilities. The need for consistent access to
the Federal Buildings Fund and a more streamlined prospectus process is
highlighted throughout the Agency's FY 2025 budget request.
Conclusion
GSA's mission is to provide the best value in real estate, which
means working with partner agencies like the FBI to deliver the
functional and secure federal facilities they need in order to fulfill
their missions. GSA is fully committed to delivering a highly effective
footprint to help the FBI deliver on their mission. GSA looks forward
to working with the FBI and this Committee on these important projects.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today. I look
forward to answering your questions.

Mr. Perry. Thank you, Mr. Doomes.
Mr. Dimos, you are now recognized for 5 minutes for your
testimony, sir.

TESTIMONY OF NICHOLAS DIMOS, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, FINANCE AND
FACILITIES DIVISION, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Mr. Dimos. Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and
members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me today to
discuss the FBI's real estate strategy.
The FBI's mission is to protect the American people and
uphold the United States Constitution. We do this work from our
56 field offices located in metropolitan areas across the
United States and in approximately 350 smaller regional sites
across the country. From these roughly 400 locations, we cover
over 3.8 million square miles of United States Territory where
we gather intelligence on terrorists seeking to harm Americans,
where foreign intelligence actors seek to erode our economic
and military capabilities, where our companies are being
hacked, where fentanyl is being trafficked, and where gangs are
threatening our communities.
Our mission directly impacts the type of space we need.
Standard office space does not meet the needs of our special
agents, intelligence analysts, scientists, and other
professionals. The FBI requires command centers, interview
rooms, space for seized drug evidence, weapons vaults, computer
forensics laboratories, automotive bays for SWAT vehicles, and
space to house equipment for the FBI's Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives response mission.
In addition to FBI employees, our national security and
traditional law enforcement programs are supported by more than
7,000 task force officers, many of whom are co-located in FBI
space for case coordination and intelligence sharing. These
officers support us through cyber, violent crime, gang, and
joint terrorism task forces. Our communities are safer. Our
country is safer because we are sitting side by side with these
partners.
Security also drives FBI space requirements. Hostile actors
seek to cause harm to FBI personnel and facilities and
exfiltrate sensitive information. As we saw just last week when
a hostile actor rammed into the gate at the FBI's Atlanta field
office, security requirements like vehicle barriers provide
critical protection to our working men and women and to our
sensitive intelligence.
While these mission, partnership, and security requirements
incur additional facilities costs, the FBI team and I are
committed to being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars. As
part of this commitment, over the past several years, the FBI
has reassessed the geographic distribution of key functions,
relocating programs and teams from the national capital region
to West Virginia, Idaho, Alabama, and other locations across
the country. As a result, over the past 5 years, the FBI has
consolidated 10 leases in the national capital region alone,
totaling almost $24 million in annual rent savings.
In recent years, we have also reduced our office space,
workstation size, and consolidated closed investigative files
at our Central Records Complex in Winchester, Virginia. We are
similarly transitioning evidence storage from costly leased
space across the country to a facility in Georgia.
We have relocated many assets outside of the national
capital region, and yet certain functions must remain in the DC
area, which is why the new headquarters project is critically
important to us. Investing hundreds of millions of dollars, if
not billions, to sustain the J. Edgar Hoover Building is not
the best use of taxpayer dollars, hence our request for a new
facility and why the FBI and GSA continue to partner closely on
next steps for the project.
The risk of doing nothing to protect our people and
sensitive information is too great with continued pipe bursts,
concrete instability, and failing heating and cooling equipment
at JEH. As we work together on the new headquarters project and
other important facilities needs across the country, you have
the FBI's and my commitment to ensure we are doing right by the
taxpayer each step of the way.
Thank you for inviting me to appear before you today, and I
am happy to answer your questions.
[Mr. Dimos' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Nicholas Dimos, Assistant Director, Finance and
Facilities Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation
Good morning, Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and Members of
the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you
today to testify about the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) real
estate strategy, both in the National Capital Region (NCR) and across
the country.
The mission of the FBI is to protect the American people and uphold
the U.S. Constitution. The FBI's 37,000-person workforce worldwide--
special agents, intelligence analysts, scientists, lawyers, engineers,
information technology specialists, language specialists, fingerprint
examiners, victim specialists, gunsmiths, and many more--work each day
to fulfill this commitment and responsibility to the nation. To
complete this important work, the FBI relies on its people,
partnerships, innovation, and processes--which are supported through
the access to secure and efficient facilities.
Today, the FBI is located in 56 field offices centrally located in
major metropolitan areas across the United States and Puerto Rico. In
addition, the FBI operates approximately 350 smaller offices, known as
resident agencies, generally located in smaller cities and towns. The
FBI's placement of facilities is evaluated on an ongoing basis; as
threats shift and evolve, the FBI has implemented changes to its
workforce allocation and real estate portfolio. Over the past ten
years, based on an evaluation of the evolving threat environment, the
FBI has closed approximately 24 resident agencies and opened four new
resident agencies. Of particular note, in FY 2019, the FBI requested
and received Congressional Appropriations Committee approval through
the congressional relocation reporting (CRR) process to combine the
Memphis and Knoxville field offices into one centrally located
Nashville field office. Although some personnel will remain in Memphis
and Knoxville (as resident agency facilities), many personnel will
relocate to the new Nashville field office. This change was based on
population growth patterns across the State of Tennessee and the
evolving threat environment. This consolidation allows the FBI to more
efficiently address national security and crime problems across the
state while reducing duplicative administrative positions and enhancing
investigative capacity. The FBI and General Services Administration
(GSA) are currently re-evaluating the procurement strategy for the
Nashville field office facility to ensure it meets mission needs at a
cost that aligns with the current budget environment.
The threat environment also impacts the space and size requirements
within FBI facilities. After September 11, 2001, the workload and
workforce of the FBI transformed as the FBI saw significant growth in
its counterterrorism, counterintelligence, cyber, and intelligence
programs. Not only did this transformation increase the operational
tempo of the FBI, but it increased the number of positions by almost
13,000 (from over 24,000 positions in 2001 to over 37,000 positions
today). In addition to the FBI workforce, over the past two decades the
FBI has increasingly relied on the partnership of federal, state,
local, and tribal law enforcement partners. Since 2001, over 600 new
task forces have been established, bringing over 7,000 task force
officers into FBI space for case coordination and intelligence sharing.
FBI facilities consist of much more than office space--they are
operational spaces that enable the FBI to conduct joint operations with
these federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement partners
through Joint Terrorism, Cyber, Safe Streets, and other task forces;
analyze and disseminate essential intelligence to foreign and domestic
partners; forensically exploit digital media and other evidence
collected during the course of investigations; monitor audio, visual,
and electronic surveillance; coordinate undercover operations; serve as
a translation hub for foreign language needs throughout the United
States Intelligence Community (USIC) and for FBI cases; host meetings
with private sector partners to convey sensitive threat information;
and coordinate extraterritorial investigations overseas.
FBI facilities support these unique mission sets, to include space
for custodial interviews of suspects, interviews of victims, evidence
holding and processing, weapons and ammunition vaults, computer
forensics laboratories, automotive bays capable of housing specialty
vehicles (e.g., SWAT vehicles), and space to house specialty equipment
for the FBI's Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and
Explosives (CBRNE) response mission. These requirements drive some of
our tenant improvement costs when working with GSA to identify
locations for FBI field offices.
The FBI's expanded national security and intelligence mission over
the past two decades has resulted in significant investments in secure
space that supports intelligence analysis and investigations at the Top
Secret classification level. Additionally, security features, such as
vehicle barriers, visitor screening areas, and Secure Compartmented
Information Facilities (SCIFs) are required. Security features like
these are expensive and another key driver of our tenant improvement
costs when working with GSA, but are necessary to protect the FBI
workforce and the intelligence information we work with.
In addition to field office locations, the FBI has occupied the J.
Edgar Hoover (JEH) Building since 1974. Since that time, the mission of
the FBI has evolved--particularly in complex national security
investigations and cases requiring sophisticated technology tradecraft
and tools--but the building and technical infrastructure of the
facility was not designed to support the modern FBI and have not kept
pace with this mission evolution. Moreover, the facility infrastructure
of JEH has deteriorated to the point where hundreds of millions--if not
billions--of dollars would be required to fully renovate and sustain
it. Concrete on the exterior of the building is crumbling, and netting
is attached around the building's perimeter to catch concrete from
falling onto pedestrians passing by on sidewalks below. There have also
been instances where interior concrete has fallen into employee
workspaces. Pipes routinely leak or burst, which has resulted in damage
to FBI technology, records, and space. The deteriorating infrastructure
and failing technology of the current headquarters building will
continue to make it increasingly difficult to rapidly address
developing threats and enhance collaboration across FBI divisions and
programs. In addition, JEH cannot accommodate all employees in the NCR,
so the FBI maintains other leases to house those employees.
Since the new headquarters process began nearly two decades ago,
the FBI has reassessed what functions need to remain in the NCR versus
those that can be re-located to other parts of the United States. FBI
headquarters consists of many different locations across the country,
including in Quantico, Virginia; Huntsville, Alabama; Pocatello, Idaho;
and Clarksburg, West Virginia. These facilities enable the FBI to take
advantage of existing infrastructure in lower cost of living
environments and create centers of excellence to address specific
national security or criminal threats.
The journey for every FBI employee begins at Quantico. The FBI
Academy at Quantico hosts world-class special agent, intelligence
analyst, and professional staff training, as well as premier
professional development for state, local, and international law
enforcement partners. Over the years, the Quantico complex has grown
from supporting a single FBI entity and mission--the FBI Academy--to a
multi-mission venue. In addition to serving as a national training
asset, Quantico also houses key operational entities, such as the FBI's
Laboratory (LAB), the Operational Technology Division (OTD), and the
Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG), including the Hostage Rescue
Team (HRT).
FBI training and workforce development does not stop after basic
training delivered at Quantico. Over time, advanced national security,
intelligence, and specialty training for the FBI workforce and its
partners will occur at the Richard Shelby Center for Innovation and
Advanced Training campus on Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. As
national security and traditional law enforcement threats leverage
technology and increasingly sophisticated methods to commit crimes, the
Redstone campus will provide ongoing training on technology, tools, and
tradecraft needed to stay ahead of the threat. The FBI has had a
presence on Redstone Arsenal since the 1970s, when the FBI's Hazardous
Devices School (HDS) was established. Over the course of the past
decade, and thanks to the partnership with the U.S. Army, the FBI has
been able to strategically relocate many functions to Redstone. As part
of this effort, in the early 2000s, the FBI relocated the Terrorist
Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC) and the Weapons of Mass
Destruction Directorate (WMDD) explosives-related forensic and
technical exploitation, intelligence, research and development, and
training operations to be near the HDS, creating a counter-improvised
explosive device (IED) Center of Excellence. Shortly thereafter, the
FBI constructed buildings to house personnel working to improve
computer network defense/cybersecurity and intelligence functions.
Later this year, construction will be complete on the Innovation
Center, bringing multiple technology-focused divisions together to
train, conduct cyber threat intelligence analysis and data analytics,
and target rapidly changing technological threats. The Innovation
Center will also house a kinetic cyber range, a virtual reality
classroom, multi-purpose classrooms with enhanced audio/visual
capabilities, labs, and workspaces. These assets will enable the FBI to
coordinate with partners in the USIC and across government, the private
sector, and academia to conduct real-life scenarios in a controlled
cyber environment.
The FBI has maintained a presence in Pocatello, Idaho since 1984,
when what was formerly a Naval ordinance plant was purchased as a
western regional computer support center. Currently, nine FBI divisions
and a resident agency of the Salt Lake City field office operate from
Pocatello, with responsibilities for investigations, intelligence,
travel processing, records management, and information technology.
Almost a decade ago, the FBI worked with the Department of Justice
(DOJ) to consolidate almost 100 disparate DOJ data centers into three,
two of which are run by the FBI--one in Pocatello and one at the FBI's
Clarksburg, West Virginia complex. The consolidation enabled the FBI to
reduce operational costs, create efficiencies (most notably through
energy reduction), and modernize the technological architecture. This
is especially important as data has become an increasingly integral
part of the FBI mission.
In the early 1990s, Congress authorized the FBI to purchase and
construct a campus in Clarksburg, West Virginia. Originally designated
as the home to the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS)
Division to revolutionize how fingerprints were collected, analyzed,
and shared, it now houses approximately 12 different FBI divisions and
supports partnerships with the Department of Defense, academia, and
other government organizations. In 2021, in an effort to be as
efficient as possible, the FBI relocated the Pittsburgh field office's
resident agency that had been in leased space in Clarksburg, West
Virginia onto the campus, thus eliminating rental costs and maximizing
the use of our owned property.
The combination of this geographic realignment of the FBI workforce
with the new headquarters plan to consolidate approximately nine NCR
locations will allow the government to save tens of millions of dollars
in annual lease payments. Already, over the past five years, ten leases
were consolidated in the NCR, totaling approximately 502,000 square
feet and $23.6 million in annual rent savings.
Fiscal stewardship is a bedrock driver of FBI real estate
decisions, and the FBI actively assesses its real estate portfolio and
seeks to maximize value to the taxpayers with each investment decision.
To reduce real estate costs, the FBI has made concerted efforts to
reduce space requirements in expensive leases. For example, in 2020,
the Central Records Complex opened in Winchester, Virginia, which
allowed the FBI to store case files and records in this government-
owned GSA facility rather than requiring square footage in metropolitan
leases across the country. The FBI is implementing a similar initiative
for evidence storage, relocating evidence to a Regional Evidence
Storage Facility in Norcross, Georgia. As mentioned above, we have also
moved and consolidated data centers from costly leased locations in
downtown areas to owned facilities in locations that have significantly
lower costs related to power and infrastructure. Finally, the FBI also
pursues opportunities to co-locate with local police departments and
other partners to utilize space in their facilities when it meets
operational and security requirements.
In closing, Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and Subcommittee
Members, I thank you for this opportunity to testify on the FBI's
nationwide real estate strategy. In all of these endeavors, the FBI is
committed to ensuring that taxpayer funding is well spent and
facilities meet our mission requirements. The need to reduce space
costs when feasible and maximize real estate utilization is
particularly important in the current fiscal environment. Based on the
final FY 2024 appropriation and the anticipated FY 2025 budget
environment, the FBI and GSA are reviewing pending leasing actions to
ensure the procurement strategy and program of requirements
appropriately balance FBI mission needs with current budget
constraints. We look forward to working with this Committee on these
shared goals, and we appreciate your support. I am happy to answer any
questions you might have.

Mr. Perry. We thank you both for your testimony. We will
now turn to questions. The Chair recognizes himself for 5
minutes for a question, and I am going to start with Mr. Dimos.
As you know, Congress is expected to consider
reauthorization of section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act. Can you tell members of the committee at
which FBI facilities--the ones you have enumerated, including
headquarters, the satellite facilities, the numerous places
around the country--does the Bureau receive, store, and sift
through the commercially provided data on Americans, or is it
done across multiple locations and offices?
Mr. Dimos. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question. I am
not an investigator of the FBI. I am a facilities and finance
guy.
Mr. Perry. You work for the FBI, right? You know what their
mission is, you know what they do. You are testifying before
this committee, where we consider the leases and the space that
the FBI gets. So, I would think you would know the mission so
you could impart it to these members of this committee so we
can make the appropriate decisions.
I am just asking, where does that occur? If you don't know,
then we will ask you to find out, but we need to know where
that occurs.
Mr. Dimos. So, sir, while I can't get into the specifics of
talking about FISA as a----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. I am just asking about the third-
party data that the FBI buys where they would otherwise need a
warrant. Where do they use that information? Where do they cull
through that information? Is it done at multiple facilities? Is
it one facility? Is it a couple facilities? What are we looking
at?
Mr. Dimos. I would have to follow up with you, sir, on the
specific facilities where that type of work would be conducted.
Mr. Perry. OK, then I am going to ask that you do that. I
am going to need to know that answer. So, that is going to be a
formal request.
Regarding what is known as the integrated program
management, I would call it a quota system. I am sure that you
folks don't like that terminology, but it is apparent to me
that that's what is used, and it is planned out at the
beginning of the fiscal year to ensure that these field offices
and the different venues, for metrics' sake, if nothing else,
they work towards those goals.
Can you tell me, is that done across the panoply, the
entire purview of the FBI's lease portfolio? Is that done at
each one of the offices, or are there certain places where that
integrated program management quota system is not used?
Mr. Dimos. Congressman, just to make sure I understand the
question, you are asking how integrated program management
affects our leasing strategy?
Mr. Perry. Yes, is it used at every single one of the
locations that quota system--we need to--the point is that if
you are using that quota system to provide results that are
metrics, and you are asking the American taxpayer to fund all
these different locations based on that, that would drive our
decision. It certainly would drive my decision on the value of
the leased space and how much you actually need.
Mr. Dimos. Sure.
Mr. Perry. And it includes--when I talk about integrated
program management, it would also include the bonuses that are
received by FBI officials for reaching or attaining that quota.
And if that is occurring at all these different locations, that
would drive at least my decision, too. So, I am interested to
know if that integrated program management quota system is
instituted at every single location, including headquarters.
Mr. Dimos. My understanding, sir--and I can take this back
to confirm, but IPM is really focused on field office metrics
and evaluating field office performance with a whole lot of
feedback and analysis and support by headquarters components.
And I would say, stepping back from IPM specifically, each
year the FBI is evaluating the threats in each of the specific
field offices, evaluating staffing levels at those field
offices to ensure that we are appropriately staffed, and we are
working the threats as we should. And----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. So, I don't want to put words in
your mouth, Mr. Dimos, sir, but I want to--so, if I am going to
characterize what I am hearing--I want to brief you back--is
that IPM, what I would consider a quota system for law
enforcement, is used at every one of the offices other than
headquarters. Is that essentially what you are telling me?
Mr. Dimos. I am not an expert in IPM, sir, so, I would need
to follow up with my colleagues.
Mr. Perry. OK, then that is going to be another specific
request for your office to return the information to us, this
committee.
Can you explain why the FBI is still proposing
authorization for 2.1 million square feet, and with less
individuals? What are we missing there?
Mr. Dimos. No, I appreciate that question, sir. So, there
is still a significant amount of planning still required by the
FBI as we put together our more detailed program of
requirements. The report that was submitted a couple of weeks
ago references up to 2.1 million square feet. But I will tell
you there is still a whole lot of additional work that I need
to be doing on my end within the FBI before I can give you and
the committee kind of a final answer on what we think our
square footage requirement is.
Mr. Perry. OK, so, what I am hearing is you are saying it
is a work in progress----
Mr. Dimos [interposing]. Yes.
Mr. Perry [continuing]. And that number actually might be
adjusted down. But we will be interested in that information.
I see I have gone over my time, so, I will yield to the
gentlelady from Nevada, the ranking member, Ms. Titus.
[Discussion off the record.]
Mr. Perry. OK, Ms. Titus yields to Mr. Larsen.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Well, thank you. I prefer that
she didn't yield to me because I don't want to take her time.
So, hopefully you mean that she has her own 5 minutes. Got it.
Mr. Perry. You are taking her place in the order. That's
how I see that.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Got it, OK.
Mr. Perry. As long as you are OK with that.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. I am fine with that. Fair enough,
thanks. I am a stickler for rules.
Mr. Dimos, your testimony didn't necessarily come across as
a glowing endorsement of the selection process, as we have
discussed in the past. And so, when you appeared before the
subcommittee in December, you expressed concerns, the FBI's
concerns, with the selection process for the new headquarters.
And last week, GSA submitted a report proposing the site
acquisition pursuant to the Fiscal Year 2022 Consolidated
Appropriations Act.
So, where does the FBI sit in terms now with its
satisfaction with the process that resulted in the selection of
the Greenbelt site?
Mr. Dimos. Thank you for the question, Congressman. Our
process concerns remain. They have not changed. And so, we
continue to await the findings of GSA's OIG so that we can see
their complete review and analysis of the process concerns that
we have put forward.
But of course we know, separate from those process
concerns, that the J. Edgar Hoover Building is still failing,
and we need a long-term solution for a headquarters facility.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes.
Mr. Dimos. And so, we continue to work with GSA, from a
construction planning perspective.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. OK, great. And the title of this
hearing, ``From Headquarters Building to Field Offices:
Examining the FBI's Real Estate Needs and Strategy,'' we
haven't asked anyone to investigate this. Obviously, we are
asking some questions about the use of field offices and
whether or not the footprint in field offices is both enough or
too much. Is it the right kind of footprint?
How would you assess GSA's analysis of your field office
footprint and the uses that are necessary for these field
offices?
Mr. Dimos. Sure. No, thank you for that question.
We continue to evaluate our field office portfolio. And
going back to my beginning remarks, we continue to evaluate our
field office portfolio because the threat continues to change.
And as trends across the country adjust, we must similarly be
evaluating our staffing model. As technology adjusts over time,
that impacts some of the specific space build-out and power
build-out in our facilities as more and more of our
investigative work involves high-tech-type capabilities.
From a threat environment perspective, we are also
continuing to evaluate how the threat impacts security risks to
our people, to our facilities, to our information. And so, we
continue to evaluate the threat environment and how that might
impact changes we need to make to our security posture.
And I would say, beyond just reflecting on this, we have
very real-world examples of how we have adjusted our field
office posture over the last several years. Over the last 12
years, we have closed 24 of our resident agencies while opening
4. We have, obviously, put forward our plan to consolidate the
Knoxville and Memphis field offices into Nashville, which is a
significant level of, kind of, reevaluation and reimagination
of our support to the State of Tennessee.
So, we continue to evaluate improvements and adjustments to
our field space plan.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Mr. Doomes, in a typical
procurement, GSA provides the shell of the building, and the
agency pays for the build-out. Given the FBI's security needs,
I imagine the FBI's build-out costs can be relatively high. Do
you all calculate the upfront costs of build-out? And does that
then discourage agencies from moving when leases expire? Is
there too much, I don't know, captured capital, if you will?
Mr. Doomes. Thank you for that question, Congressman. That
is certainly a part of our consideration.
These high TI costs do impact, but GSA provides the basic
shell, and we try to find a competitive rental rate within the
district and target that rate. And then the FBI brings money to
the table to build out some of those specialized uses that they
have that you outlined earlier. And we work together, and
sometimes we are able to hit the mark.
Sometimes leases are the most cost effective way. We like
to do construction, because oftentimes owning a building is
more cost effective than leasing. But because we have limited
resources and we don't have full access to the Federal
Buildings Fund, unfortunately, sometimes we are forced to move
to leases instead of federally owned construction.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The Chair now
recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin, Representative Van
Orden.
Mr. Van Orden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Doomes, do you know who Nina Albert is?
Nina Albert. You do? Can you turn your microphone on,
please?
Mr. Doomes. I am sorry. Yes, Congressman.
Mr. Van Orden. OK, and she is the former Building
Commissioner for GSA?
Mr. Doomes. She is the former Public Buildings Service
Commissioner.
Mr. Van Orden. Correct. And what is she doing now?
Mr. Doomes. I believe she is the deputy mayor of economic
development for the District of Columbia.
Mr. Van Orden. Right, so, she is in charge of public
buildings for the District of Columbia.
So, she left the GSA because she was an abject failure at
her position. That's just a fact. And so, now she has moved on
to run the public buildings for the city of Washington, DC.
So, could you see potentially that this would maybe not
give us the greatest amount of confidence in the GSA's ability
to plan for certain activities such as reimagining the entire
footprint for the FBI?
That's a rhetorical question.
Mr. Dimos, what is the occupancy rate of the J. Edgar
Hoover Building right now at 10:37 on Wednesday, April 10?
Mr. Dimos. On average, I think we are roughly at over 4,000
seats filled at this point in the J. Edgar Hoover Building,
sir.
Mr. Van Orden. How many seats are available?
Mr. Dimos. Around 6,000.
Mr. Van Orden. So, how many are filled right now?
Mr. Dimos. Around 4,000, sir. A little over 4,000.
Mr. Van Orden. So, I was an enlisted guy, so, I am just
going to do that math in my head. It is about two-thirds
occupancy. Is that right?
Mr. Dimos. Yes, sir. So, there are certain portions of the
facility, particularly the lower levels, where we have needed
to remove people from the space, given some of the
infrastructure challenges that we have had in the building.
Mr. Van Orden. Yes.
Mr. Dimos. There is also continuing to be significant
infrastructure challenges that limit how much high-tech
capabilities can be in the facility.
Mr. Van Orden. I get it. OK. So, you said the FBI's mission
is to--operational spaces, conducting operations, Federal,
State, and local stuff. You are doing joint counterterrorism,
cyber, protecting the streets. You support unique missions,
including custodial spaces for suspects, interviews of victims,
evidence holding and processing, weapons, ammunition, computer
forensic laboratories, automotive, and stuff. So, it takes a
lot of space, right?
Mr. Dimos. It does, sir.
Mr. Van Orden. OK. Can you tell me how much space it takes
to have FBI agents surveilling parents at school board meetings
and deeming members of the Catholic Church as domestic
terrorists? How many office spaces did that take?
Mr. Dimos. Congressman, I appreciate your question. That
is--I can't speak to that question, sir.
Mr. Van Orden. You can't. So, what is your pay grade? I
mean, it's public information.
Mr. Dimos. I am a member of the Senior Executive Service,
sir.
Mr. Van Orden. OK, so, you are an SES dude in charge of the
buildings for the FBI, and you can't tell me how many of your
office spaces are used to conduct surveillance on American
citizens and parents at school board meetings asking very
specific questions about their treatment of their children and/
or declaring the Catholic Church or members of the Catholic
Church domestic terrorists.
The reason I ask this question for you is that I don't
really think that you guys have taken the time to do a
detailed, indepth study of what you are actually doing, your
members. And so, if I take that to be true, which it is, then I
don't think you can sit here and tell us how much space you
actually need. Because unfortunately, your agency has gotten so
far off mission from when it was established--your building is
named after J. Edgar Hoover--gotten so far off task that I
don't believe that you are capable of honestly telling us the
mission needs of the FBI at this point.
So, in combination with the GSA's inability to actually
plan for a building, and your inability to articulate exactly
what the mission is of the FBI other than these flowery words,
I don't have any confidence that we are going to judiciously
expend the American taxpayers' dollars.
And let me be straight with you. One of my best friends in
the world is a former FBI agent who I deployed with in combat
to Afghanistan, and I would do anything for that man. I
protected his life, specifically. And so, I have great
reverence for the former institution of the FBI. But I, along
with the majority of my constituents and so many American
citizens, have lost faith in your institution. And for you two
to sit here and ask for billions and billions and billions of
dollars without being able to articulate why you need it is
just another symptom of a broken institution.
With that, I yield back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The Chair now
recognizes the ranking member of the subcommittee, the
gentlelady from Nevada, Ms. Titus.
Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Dimos, let me be sure I understand. When you say it is
two-thirds occupied, doesn't that include some people who have
field assignments, come in occasionally, kind of like here in
the House? People are working, they are in and out of
committees, in and out of their office. It's not something that
you can count like it's two-thirds occupied.
Mr. Dimos. It is a constantly fluctuating number, ma'am.
Ms. Titus. Yes.
Mr. Dimos. I mean, as you said, I mean, there are
operations going on every day that are causing people to surge
into the facility, causing people to leave the facility on a
given day.
Of course, there are large portions of the facility that
are not dedicated just to workspaces in terms of desks and
seats, but also to operational space, command centers that we
use in the course of day-to-day management of the FBI.
Ms. Titus. Storage, that sort of thing. Yes, I just want to
make that clear for the record.
Mr. Doomes, according to the report, that site selection
report that the GSA just submitted, $845 million in
construction funding has already been appropriated, and $3.5
billion, though, for this new headquarters--or it was going to
be transferred from the proposed Federal Capital Revolving
Fund. Now, that fund doesn't exist, and it hasn't. Several
Presidents have tried to get this on and they haven't been able
to. So, do you have some secret that this is going to be
constituted, or do you have some alternate plan for if it
doesn't happen?
Mr. Doomes. Thank you for that question, Congresswoman.
Our approach right now is we are requesting the creation of
the Federal Capital Revolving Fund, along with $10 billion
worth of seed money. We have also been requesting money through
the normal appropriations process, but we continue to believe
that that is the best way to fund the FBI headquarters. But we
remain committed to working with this committee as well as
other committees about any other solutions that are on the
table. But right now that is the administration's plan.
Ms. Titus. If that new building is built out in Maryland or
northern Virginia, what happens to the old Hoover Building?
Mr. Doomes. Congresswoman, we would, just like any other
property in our portfolio, we would examine what the
possibilities are. There is the potential that we might retain
the site, dispose of the site.
We have a national portfolio plan where we scour our
inventory and we evaluate each and every asset, and we decide--
we have been making decisions about what our core assets are
that we would like to reinvest in. And assets that are not our
core assets, we are looking at the possibility of disposing
them. As this plan with the FBI becomes a little bit firmer, we
will evaluate the Hoover Building in the same fashion.
Ms. Titus. Well, the new headquarters won't be called
Hoover, will it?
Mr. Doomes. Congresswoman, it has been the practice of GSA
that we do not name buildings. We await on direction from
Congress.
Ms. Titus. I heard my colleague talking about how much he
respected the old FBI, but not the new FBI. And I guess that
means J. Edgar Hoover with all his issues.
Anyway, I would like to go back to Mr. Dimos, and I want to
ask you about your position on utilizing public-private
partnerships to acquire space. Is that something that is
actively pursued?
And if it is, how do you get the security for those
buildings if you don't control the construction or the
management of the building? You were talking about needing
fencing or certain high-tech accommodations, and just the
security in and out the door. How does that work?
Mr. Dimos. I mean, specifically on your question,
Congresswoman, about how does the FBI view public-private
partnerships as a means of funding space projects, we
ultimately rely on funding strategies in coordination with GSA
and the Office of Management and Budget. So, I would probably
defer to Mr. Doomes specifically on that point.
But as a general matter, how do we handle security in
leased facilities, nonfederally owned facilities?
Ms. Titus. Right.
Mr. Dimos. We have a layered approach to security in the
FBI. As part of our process, we have security professionals who
will review the sites, who will put forward recommendations
that I on my team will implement to ensure appropriate physical
security, technical security, things I probably can't get into
too much more in this setting.
We also have processes to ensure that all individuals
entering the space have the appropriate clearance and have been
vetted so that no individuals are entering into FBI space
without appropriate authorization.
There are also, of course, elements, when they come up in
the requirements-gathering process for the PORs for the sites
where there are rules on setback and vehicle barriers, visitor
screening facilities, those types of things that, depending on
the procurement strategy, the building owner, the lessors could
be incorporating into their building design and construction.
Ms. Titus. That is part of the rent, or is that on top of
it, Mr. Dimos?
Mr. Dimos. So, we are required--for these above-standard
tenant improvement costs, the FBI is generally providing those
funds upfront. And then, from a maintenance perspective, it is
negotiated on a case-by-case basis with the lessor.
Ms. Titus. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady. The Chair now
recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana, Representative Graves.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you
both for being here.
When we spoke in November, I raised some concerns about the
adjustment in criteria that was made on your selection process.
And I will make note I was shortly thereafter called to a
woodshed conversation with Congressman Steny Hoyer.
But in any case, I know that last month, GSA submitted a
prospectus to Congress to consolidate the Hoover Building, as
well as eight other buildings. And I know that there are a
number of people, including our chairman, that have strong
concerns about the criteria and what was actually submitted.
I asked last time about the number of meetings, and I asked
about the consultations between GSA and the FBI and the
conversations they had with representatives of other States.
Have you all provided any information to the committee about
some of the meetings and consultations that you have had, and
the content of the meetings with the States on this site
selection process and relocation?
Mr. Doomes. Thank you for that question, Congressman. I
believe we have provided this committee with some of that
information. We provided over 6,100 documents, and we have
continued to provide them on a rolling basis.
But I believe we have provided you with consultation,
deliberations, as well as----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. Mr. Doomes, let me
ask this, and I--obviously, that is a tremendous amount of
information. But I am not clear on how much information you
have. So, I don't know if that is 99.9 percent, or I don't know
if that is 1 percent. Can you give some clarity in regard to
how much more information you think is owed to the committee to
fulfill the request?
Mr. Doomes. I do not believe that we have fulfilled all of
the requests that we received in December, but we are committed
to cooperating with this committee and continuing to provide
you documents on a rolling basis.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. OK, I appreciate that.
The next question--and I apologize, I had to step out for a
minute and I didn't hear the full dialogue that you had with
Mr. DVO here. But in regard to Nina Albert, did you provide
clarity on which meetings she was involved in and any role that
she played in this? Was that answered or information provided
to the committee?
Mr. Doomes. I believe so, Congressman. We have provided in
our GSA reading room, as a part of making this a transparent
site selection process, we have provided the documents related
to the amendment to the site selection process that was made, I
believe, in July of 2023, which made it clear that Ms. Albert
was going to be serving as the site selection authority.
So, I believe we have provided those documents----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. I look forward to
following up with our chair and staff to make sure that those
requests were fulfilled. I think we had the understanding that
there may be some gaps in information on both of those.
The next one is, as I understand, I think 50 percent of the
FBI employees actually are Virginia residents. And I think the
other 50 percent are some combination of DC, Maryland, and a
few other States. Have you all done a traffic analysis looking
at the impact of the Greenbelt site and what would end up
happening with traffic patterns as a result? Traffic impacts.
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, I don't believe we did a study of
the traffic patterns, but transit was one of the factors in
criteria that was considered when we were selecting the site. I
believe that particular area, transportation access, was 20
percent of the site selection criteria.
And I would point you to--it was a discussion of that in
the site selection decision, where we discussed what the
impacts were to traffic and getting FBI employees to and fro
from the site.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. The last question I have, in the
117th Congress, we passed bipartisan legislation that allowed
for the GSA to negotiate below-market lease rates. Have you all
received implementation guidance from OMB? Has that law been
implemented?
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, we continue to work with the
Office of Management and Budget on the legislation that was
passed.
At the direction of this committee, GSA has been
consistently trying to negotiate purchase options within our
lease contracts, but there is still some disagreement as we
continue to work with OMB about bargain purchase options.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. And so, I am not missing anything
in that the delay in implementing this is actually costing
taxpayers more money, potentially, because you are currently
not allowed to go and negotiate below-market rates at this
point?
Mr. Doomes. We continue to work with OMB and with this
committee on that matter. But right now, we do not believe we
have the authority to negotiate bargain purchase options.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. So, what I said is accurate? At
this point, you don't have the ability to save additional
taxpayer funds, even though the law has been enacted?
Mr. Doomes. We are committed to working with this
committee, but no, we do not believe we have the authority to
negotiate bargain purchase options.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. I will interpret that as a yes.
Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Perry. I thought so. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
Before turning to Ms. Norton, Representative Norton here, I
just want to inform everybody that, because the Chair still has
some outstanding questions, and some of the other Members do,
we will do a second round. But with that, the Chair now turns
to Representative Norton for 5 minutes.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Commissioner Doomes, it's good to see you again. Congress
continues to miss your excellent work as a staffer.
At last December's hearing on FBI headquarters, I asked you
about the future of the site of the FBI's current headquarters
on Pennsylvania Avenue in the District of Columbia. The current
site is a prime opportunity for mixed-use development which
could help activate Pennsylvania Avenue and draw visitors off
The National Mall and into downtown DC and, of course, generate
tax revenue for the District of Columbia.
You testified that GSA was currently working through a plan
for the site. You also said that if GSA determines in its
review that the site is surplus property, GSA will dispose of
it. What is the status of GSA's review of that site?
Mr. Doomes. Thank you for that question, Congresswoman.
Unfortunately, I don't have an update. We continue to
review this site, as well as all of the assets within our 362
million-square-foot portfolio as a part of our national
portfolio plan and identifying our core assets and which assets
we believe are underutilized or surplus to the needs of the
Government. We have not come to a determination on the Hoover
site at this point.
Ms. Norton. When you finish with that review, I hope you
will submit it to this committee.
Mr. Doomes. Absolutely, Congresswoman.
Ms. Norton. With a new headquarters, GSA plans to identify
federally owned space to support 750 to 1,000 FBI personnel who
will remain in the District of Columbia. Where is the GSA
considering relocating these personnel in DC, and does this
include new construction?
Mr. Doomes. Congresswoman, we continue to scour our
portfolio here in the District of Columbia. I think we plan to
continue to work with the FBI as they work through their
program of requirements. And as their program of requirements
is finalized, we will look to some of the buildings here in
Washington, DC, perhaps some that are underutilized now, to
find out the best candidate, working closely with the FBI on
what their security needs are, as well as their proximity
issues and their need to be close to the Main Justice, the
White House, and Congress.
Ms. Norton. Well, is new construction included?
Mr. Doomes. Congresswoman, right now, all the options are
on the table. But given our portfolio here in the District of
Columbia, I think we would probably lean into repair and
alterations on an existing building. But we have not come to a
final determination, and we are waiting until the FBI completes
their program of requirements.
Ms. Norton. I would also like to discuss plans for a new
FEMA headquarters. The prospectus for the modernization of the
ROB building at 7th and D Street puts the cost of total
construction at $177 million. However, the pre-solicitation
estimates put the cost of construction at $400 to $500 million.
Why is there such a gap between the prospectus and pre-
solicitation estimates?
Mr. Doomes. Congresswoman, thank you for the opportunity to
clarify on that issue.
When GSA provides a building to another Federal agency, GSA
is responsible for providing a warm, lit shell. And much like
our relationship with the FBI, the FBI has to bring a certain
amount of money to the table to do the tenant improvements.
So, the prospectus that we submitted to Congress represents
GSA's portion of the project, with the expectation that DHS is
going to bring additional funds to the project, which takes it
up from $174 per gross square feet, up to somewhere between
$400 and $500 per gross square feet for the actual full and
complete building.
Ms. Norton. Well, thank you very much.
And Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady. And now the
Chair will recognize himself for the second round.
Mr. Dimos, I want to characterize my request to you this
way for the previous two questions that I asked that you would
respond to. Will you and can you commit to providing those
responses within the next 2 weeks, in accordance with the
statements I mentioned when I opened these proceedings?
Mr. Dimos. I will work expeditiously to meet that timeline,
sir.
Mr. Perry. Two weeks?
Mr. Dimos. I will do my best, sir.
Mr. Perry. Well, I know you will do your best, but I need a
commitment. So, if it is not 2 weeks, I can accept that. But is
it 3 weeks, then? What do you feel comfortable with?
Mr. Dimos. We will stick with the 2 weeks, sir. Do my
best----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. OK, 2 weeks. All right. Thank
you, sir.
So, with that, Mr. Doomes and Mr. Dimos, in December, the
chairman, Chairman Graves, and I sent the FBI, GSA, and the
former Public Buildings Commissioner, Nina Albert, letters with
specific questions and requesting production of certain
documents. Interestingly, we only received former Commissioner
Albert's responses by the deadline of the letter.
We subsequently received initial responses from the FBI and
the GSA that were missing a significant amount of the
information requested. Then, not surprisingly, after this
hearing was confirmed, we received an additional response on
Monday--today is Wednesday--from the FBI; and yesterday,
Tuesday, GSA. But we are still missing key responses to our
request.
When will the GSA and the FBI complete the document
production to the committee?
And Mr. Doomes, I know that Chairman Graves asked you
essentially the same question. I know you are interested in
cooperating, but, look, we've got to get something accomplished
here. You have leases pending. We need to make decisions, but
we are not going to make--I will guarantee you, I am not going
to make decisions or ask anybody on this committee to make
decisions without the complete information. So, I need to ask
you when you will complete the document production, if you
know.
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, thank you for that question. We
plan to commit the document submission as expeditiously as
possible.
Mr. Perry. Can you commit to 3 weeks, 2 weeks, 1 month, 6
years? What can you commit to?
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, we have been producing them on a
rolling basis. We will continue to do so. We want to cooperate.
We have been in close contact with your staff. But I cannot--I
don't believe I can offer a date certain, but we will----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. Can you give me your wildest
guess? I mean, you get paid every pay period, whether you
produce anything or not. The American people demand this
information through their Representatives. We have to make
decisions on behalf of the FBI. We can't make the decisions
without the information. What can you commit to? A year? Six
months? One month? Give me something.
Mr. Doomes. As soon as possible, Congressman.
Mr. Perry. Well, as soon as possible, I am going to
characterize that as 2 weeks. Will you commit to 2 weeks? It
seems like a reasonable amount of time to me, because ``as soon
as possible'' to me is, like, today. But I am going to give you
2 weeks.
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, we produce them on a rolling
basis. We will continue to do so, and as soon as possible----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. OK. So, you are not going to
answer. You are not going to commit.
Mr. Dimos, have you got anything better? This is the FBI,
the most storied and effective intelligence and law enforcement
agency on the planet. Can you commit to anything?
Mr. Dimos. Again, sir, we will work as expeditiously as
possible.
Mr. Perry. Well, I've got to tell you, that is pretty weak
in a business that I operated in. And when I managed, you
wouldn't have a job.
But with that, let me ask one final question. Taxpayers
invest a tremendous amount of money in leased field offices
that go far beyond the rental payment. There are several
examples of evidence rooms, holding cells, armories, classified
rooms, physical security infrastructure, and a variety of other
things. Most of these investments have a useful life far beyond
the 20 years, and so, it would seem extremely wasteful and
unreasonable to ask taxpayers to pay for a new build-to-suit
lease every 20 years for an FBI field office.
Does that sound reasonable? Would you agree with that, it's
unreasonable to ask them to commit to that, and then that hard
infrastructure goes away? Either one of you guys.
Mr. Dimos. Sir, absolutely. There is a significant amount
of upfront investment for FBI space. And that is why I would
say, as leases come up for renewal, that is why the vast
majority, when we look at the procurement strategy, does not
actually result in a relocation.
As we look at the last 5 years, we had 14 commercial leases
go up, reach the end of life; 12 of those ultimately resulted
in staying in place.
Mr. Perry. Well, I will tell you, we are going to be taking
a look at that portfolio with that in mind. Some of the
prospectuses pending before this committee would effectively
guarantee that wasteful outcome, and we don't want that. So, we
don't want the highest cost option possible to be justified.
And so, I just want to let you know that moving forward.
With that, my time has expired, and I would recognize now
the ranking member, Ms. Titus.
Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Over the course of the last couple of Congresses, we have
approved several new museums for The Mall. There is one for
women's history and one for Latin American history, culture, et
cetera. Are you all working on finding locations for these new
museums that are supposed to be on The Mall?
And why wouldn't you look at some of the underutilized
buildings like, say, the Department of Energy building, and
work with the Smithsonian to use some of that space for these
museums?
Mr. Doomes. Congresswoman, thank you for that question.
As you pointed out, the Smithsonian has the lead on
identifying locations, and I believe they have identified two
locations. But we are partners with the Smithsonian, we meet
with them regularly, and we are always looking at our
portfolio. And if they made a request of us, I can promise you
that we will work in a cooperative fashion with the
Smithsonian.
Ms. Titus. Well, will you check out where they are on this,
and let me know if they are moving forward, if they have made
any substantive progress, or if they are just talking about it,
or whatever?
Mr. Doomes. Congresswoman, I will commit to you that I will
absolutely meet with the Smithsonian and make sure that they
understand that we are willing to be a partner, partner with
them, and help them along the way.
Ms. Titus. Thank you. Going back to the investment that you
have to make in some of these buildings that you lease that is
upfront, and you say it lasts for 20 years, it seems to me if
you make an investment upfront on something that lasts for 20
years, that's a pretty good deal. Plus, a lot of things change
in 20 years, technology and stuff. So, if you have to redo some
things at the end of the 20 years, wouldn't that just be kind
of the normal course of things?
Mr. Dimos. Thank you----
Ms. Titus [interposing]. Mr. Dimos.
Mr. Dimos [continuing]. For the question, Congresswoman.
This is why, for each lease that comes up for renewal, we work
with GSA to reevaluate the requirements that we have for that
facility, again, looking at the threat environment, how
staffing has changed, how technology has changed. And then we
are working together with GSA on a specific procurement
strategy for each.
Ms. Titus. As you look out there for places to rent, have
you noticed any unusual changes in the rental market based on
the economy and post-COVID?
Mr. Dimos. I need to defer to Mr. Doomes on that point.
Ms. Titus. Mr. Doomes.
Mr. Doomes. Congresswoman, I think you are right. I think
there have been changes, and we are trying to evaluate. We are
going into the market, and we are aggressively working with
agencies to find the best deals.
But to your earlier point, generally, owning is cheaper
than leasing. And this is why GSA has been pursuing a fix to
the Federal Buildings Fund to give us full access to it,
because, for example, one of the outstanding FBI leases in
Cleveland, we submitted a request to Congress to allow us to
purchase the building because we determined that that was the
best option for taxpayers. And that request was not met, which
is why we had to pivot and turn to leasing.
But I agree with you, and this is why we support a fix to
the Federal Buildings Fund, because if we spend the money on
capital costs, we will be able to significantly decrease costs
to taxpayers. And it is an important thing that we are pursuing
here at GSA. It was in our fiscal year 2024 budget request. It
is also in our fiscal year 2025 budget request. And the kind of
projects that we are doing with the FBI, if we had full access
to the Federal Buildings Fund, we would be doing construction
projects instead of leases.
Ms. Titus. Imagine. Well, thank you, and I will yield back.
Thank you.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady. The Chair now
recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi, Representative
Ezell.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you both for
being here today.
Last week, the committee received an official report on the
proposed FBI headquarters. This report calls for Congress to
appropriate $10 billion to the Federal Capital Revolving Fund,
FCRF, even though this fund does not have congressional
authorization, as I understand.
Similar requests to create and fund the FCRF have been
denied in the past. Mr. Dimos, given this history, do you think
there is anything different about this request, and do you
think it will be funded?
Mr. Dimos. Thank you for the question, Congressman.
The requirement for the J. Edgar Hoover Building and a
replacement for it is real. The challenges with the facility
only continue to grow, and we need congressional support and
funding support for the project.
Mr. Ezell. OK. Switching topics a little bit, in
Mississippi's Fourth Congressional District, there are 20 GSA
buildings. Of those 20, 3 buildings are owned by GSA, while the
rest are leased. Among the 17 that are leased, the FBI has 3
satellite offices, all of which are multitenant offices. Do you
believe this is adequate security at these FBI satellite
offices in the multitenant buildings?
If not, do you have any recommendations to improve the
protection?
Mr. Dimos. Thank you for the question, Congressman.
Our satellite offices, our resident agencies have different
leasing models throughout the country. Several are in
multitenant buildings. That is not unique just to the State of
Mississippi.
As I said earlier, with each site, whether it is a stand-
alone facility or a multitenant facility, we have a security
review that takes place to ensure that it is an appropriate
level of risk that the FBI is accepting, and that we have the
appropriate countermeasures in place in order to address that
risk.
Mr. Ezell. Very good. Thank you.
Expanding on the topic of security, in 2020, the Secure
Federal Leases from Espionage and Suspicious Entanglements Act
was signed into law. This act aims to prevent foreign
influences on GSA-leased buildings. However, all 17 buildings
in my district entered lease agreements before the enactment of
the law.
Mr. Doomes, how concerned should I be about the security of
these buildings in south Mississippi, and especially regional
FBI buildings across the country?
And what is the GSA doing to ensure FBI buildings are not
indirectly controlled by foreign adversaries?
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, thank you for that question. We
are always concerned with security, and we continue to work
with our partners at the FBI.
In December of this past year, we submitted a list of all
buildings with foreign beneficial owners in any new lease
actions. But there are also existing leases that we are trying
to address, and we are proactively working with the FBI to
notify them whenever there is a foreign ownership of a building
that they are in, so that they can take the proper mitigation
steps.
Mr. Ezell. Very good.
Mr. Dimos, do you think leasing FBI satellite offices--is
this the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars and does this
accomplish the mission of the FBI?
Mr. Dimos. Our resident agencies, those satellite offices
are critically important components of the way we do our work.
And so, I would argue that the return on investment for the
American people is exceedingly high.
Mr. Ezell. Very good. I worked in one of those offices for
3 years during my career, and I felt very good every time I was
there. And let's make sure we take care of our men and women
who are out there enforcing the laws and protecting this
country.
So, thank you. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The Chair now
recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin, Representative Van
Orden.
Mr. Van Orden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have a
couple of questions, or a statement first.
The gentlelady from Nevada: J. Edgar Hoover was responsible
for some tremendous civil rights violations. And in no way,
shape, or form do I support that at all. The FBI I miss is the
one that didn't conduct over 200,000 illegal instances of
surveillance of American citizens, abusing section 702 of the
FISA to conduct unlawful surveillance on the former President,
President Trump, who should be the next President coming up
here, God willing.
I also--I am talking about the FBI that did not classify
parents at school board meetings and Catholics as domestic
terrorists. That's the FBI, the new FBI that I don't appreciate
at all. And I also do not appreciate anyone insinuating that I
would support anybody that would do anything to violate
Americans' civil rights. That is not the case.
I just want to clarify with Mr. Doomes. Did the former
Commissioner, Nina Albert, participate in any of these
negotiations at all? You said you told us that, and I don't
recall hearing it.
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, she was the site selection
authority that ultimately made the decision that the Greenbelt
provided the most value to taxpayers.
Mr. Van Orden. OK. What I would like from you is a
specific, itemized list of every meeting that she had anything
to do with, even tangentially, because, as we discussed, she
left in shame for a real good reason.
And with that, I yield back the remainder of my time to
Chairman Perry.
Mr. Perry. Well, thank you. I do have one remaining
question for Mr. Doomes.
It appears that the criteria for the site selection had
changed at some point regarding the proximity to Quantico as
well as equity. And Maryland was able to address those changes
in weighting of the site selection criteria. But it is my
understanding that Virginia was not apprized of that. Can you
confirm that?
Mr. Doomes. Thank you for the opportunity to clarify,
Congressman.
In December of 2022, Congress directed GSA to have
consultations with both Maryland and Virginia. We had those
consultations in March. As a result of those consultations, we
made changes to the criteria in July of 2023. That was
reflected in the amendment to the original site selection plan.
So, it was always clear to both delegations, and it was
posted in our GSA reading room and publicly available. So, the
criteria change: everyone knew.
Mr. Perry. So, it is your testimony and your position that
the criteria was changed, and both Maryland and Virginia had
exactly the same amount of resources, including time and
notification, to respond to the change in weighting of the
classification criteria. That is your----
Mr. Doomes [interrupting]. Absolutely, Congressman.
Mr. Perry. All right. I thank you for that.
Gentlemen, I yield back the balance of Mr. Van Orden's time
back to him if he needs it. If not----
Mr. Van Orden [interrupting]. Mr. Chairman, I do not. Thank
you very much.
Mr. Perry. OK. Thank you.
The gentleman yields back. Are there any further questions
from any members of the subcommittee who have not been
recognized?
Seeing none, that concludes this hearing for today. I would
like to thank each of the witnesses for your testimony. And we
know it's not easy sometimes being here, but we appreciate you
taking the time and standing for the questions.
And with that, this subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:14 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Questions to Elliot D. Doomes, Commissioner, Public Buildings Service,
U.S. General Services Administration, from Hon. Scott Perry

Question 1. In the recent report the General Services
Administration (GSA) submitted to the Committee pursuant to Division E,
Title V, Section 530 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L.
117-103) on the FBI Headquarters project, GSA requested authorization
to ``expeditiously move forward with site acquisition, design, design-
related consulting service, management/oversight and preliminary
construction support activities, using the existing $845 million
balance.'' \1\ However, GSA did not provide a line-item breakdown of

Support Activities, Department of Justice--Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Consolidated Headquarters, Greenbelt, Maryland (Mar. 28,
2024) (on file with Comm).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1.a. Is the taxpayer paying $845 million just for
preliminary work?
Answer. Upon adoption of resolutions approving the document's plan
by the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of
Representatives, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) intends
to expeditiously move forward with the Greenbelt, Maryland site
acquisition, project design, design related consulting services,
management/oversight, and preliminary construction support activities.
The $845 million represents the appropriations Congress has provided to
GSA to date. GSA does not yet have more detailed cost estimates, as we
are currently working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on
further defining their requirements. The resources provided to date are
sufficient to fund all of these pre-construction activities and likely
more of the project. GSA intends to submit a separate prospectus in
future fiscal years in support of construction activities for the
Greenbelt, Maryland headquarters.

Question 1.b. What is the cost of each activity? Please provide a
line-item breakdown of the costs.
Answer. The final facility size in Greenbelt, Maryland, will be
driven by updated FBI requirements. The costs set forth in answer to
this question are based on the previous program cost estimate of $3.5
billion. However, updated cost estimates are needed, and the $3.5
billion may not capture the full cost of construction. Based on that
prior program, we estimate the site acquisition and design phase
services costs as follows:

Site Acquisition: $25 million

Design: $360 million

Design Related Consulting Services: $5 million

Management & Oversight: $31 million (for Design)

Preliminary Construction Support Activities: $3 million

These previous estimates are in part informed by GSA's typical
project estimates, which anticipate that roughly ten percent of the
project's total cost will be needed for design.

Question 1.c. When will GSA submit a detailed prospectus to the
Committee?
Answer. As directed by Congress, the report transmitted to the
Committee is consistent with the requirements of section 3307(b) of
title 40, United States Code. The report has been posted online in
GSA's prospectus library, and functions as a design prospectus and
provides this Committee with all of the information needed to adopt a
resolution pursuant to section 3307(a). GSA intends to submit a
separate prospectus in future fiscal years in support of construction
activities once we have a more fully defined set of requirements from
the FBI.

Question 2. In addition to the proposed new FBI Headquarters
building, the report mentions there are parallel efforts to identify a
Federally owned downtown Washington, DC location to accommodate 750 to
1,000 FBI personnel to allow for accessibility to the Department of
Justice and other key partners.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2.a. What is the size and scope of this additional space?
Answer. GSA and FBI teams are actively engaged in discussing the
requirements for a site. The FBI's program development will continue
through the planning and development phases of the project.
The FBI project team is currently validating its requirements using
the previous 2016 Program of Requirements as the baseline, including
identifying which components go to the suburban and urban facilities,
and validating individual internal component needs.

Question 2.b. Please provide details on the status of GSA's search
for Federally owned space and a timeline of when GSA anticipates that a
site would be identified.
Answer. As noted in GSA's FY 2025 Congressional Budget
Justification, GSA and FBI continue efforts to identify a federally
owned location in Washington, DC, to support the FBI's day-to-day
engagement with the U.S. Department of Justice's headquarters, the
White House, Congress, and other partners. The FBI project team is
validating its requirements using the previous 2016 Program of
Requirements as the baseline. The FBI's program development that will
continue through the planning and development phases of the project.

Question 2.c. What specific buildings are under consideration?
Answer. GSA is currently evaluating its entire portfolio of owned
buildings in the District of Columbia; however, as noted above, we are
still working with the FBI to finalize its requirements.

Question 3. The report notes that the Greenbelt, Maryland site
acquisition is approximately $25 million, yet documentation received by
the Committee values the property at over $200 million.\3\ Prince
George's County, according to documents, has offered $50 million to
offset site acquisition costs.\4\ Can you provide a detailed
explanation and breakdown of how GSA arrived at $25 million for the
cost of the site acquisition for Greenbelt?

\4\ Letter to Aaron Hassinger, Project Executive, GSA from Angela
D. Alsobrooks, County Executive, Prince George's County, Maryland,
Sept. 16, 2022 (on file with committee).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. As has previously been shared with the Committee, WMATA
wrote to GSA in September 2022 informing the agency that a recent
appraisal of the Greenbelt site concluded the fair market value to be
$25.1 million, and that WMATA would accept this price for the site.
This letter was part of the package of materials made available to both
the Site Selection Panel and the Site Selection Authority.
Regarding the $50 million offer from Prince George's County to
offset site acquisition costs, GSA informed the County in a letter
dated September 28, 2022, that ``GSA is not accepting any direct cash
contributions from any state, locality, jurisdiction, or any other
person as part of its site selection process.'' However, GSA did share
with both the Maryland and Virginia delegations that we would take into
consideration any donations of land, as well as costs associated with
any necessary offsite improvements to support the headquarters. GSA's
acceptance of land and costs for offsite improvements is consistent
with our agency's typical practices. This was included as part of
Criterion #5: Cost, in the Site Selection Plan.

Question 4. The report notes that the Greenbelt site provides the
``greatest transportation access to FBI employees and visitors'' \5\
given its location at the Greenbelt Metro station, yet when the number
of trips to Quantico was counted over a two-month period in 2022, there
were approximately 1,700 trips by FBI personnel to Quantico and that
count did not reflect any personnel who traveled from Quantico to the
FBI Headquarters.\6\ Extrapolating, that would result in over 10,000
trips in a year to Quantico, not counting reverse travel. Moreover,
more than half of the FBI personnel live in Virginia and 98 percent
currently work in D.C. or locations in Virginia.\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 4.a. Did the Site Selection process take into account the
fact that Quantico is not accessible by Metro when evaluating which
site had the greatest access to transportation?
Answer. The final Site Selection Plan, which was developed in
coordination with the FBI and after consultations with the Maryland and
Virginia delegations, established the process under which the Site
Selection Authority (``SSA'') would render its decision. Under the
Plan, the proximity of each site to the FBI's Quantico Facility was
considered as part of Criteria #1: FBI Proximity to Mission-Related
Locations. Accessibility of Quantico to a WMATA Metrorail Station was
not a part of the Site Selection Plan.

Question 4.b. Did the Site Selection process take into account the
number of trips (likely by vehicle) FBI personnel make to Quantico in
evaluating--
Question 4.b.i. Transportation access?
Answer. As noted above, the final Site Selection Plan, which was
developed in coordination with the FBI and after consultations with the
Maryland and Virginia delegations, established the process under which
the Site Selection Authority (``SSA'') would render its decision. Under
the Plan, the accessibility of each site to various transportation
modalities was considered under Criteria #2: Transportation Access. The
proximity of each site to the FBI's Quantico Facility was considered as
part of Criteria #1: FBI Proximity to Mission-Related Locations.

Question 4.b.ii. Promoting sustainable siting?
Answer. As noted above, the final Site Selection Plan, which was
developed in coordination with the FBI and after consultations with the
Maryland and Virginia delegations, established the process under which
the Site Selection Authority (``SSA'') would render its decision. Under
the Plan, siting sustainability was considered under Criteria #4:
Promoting Sustainable Siting and Advancing Equity. The proximity of
each site to the FBI's Quantico Facility was considered as part of
Criteria #1: FBI Proximity to Mission-Related Locations.
It is worth noting that as part of the Site Selection Authority's
decision regarding Criteria #4 (Promoting Sustainable Siting and
Advancing Equity), the SSA ``looked at which site would reduce
vehicular trips the most. . . .'' \8\ Furthermore, using a nationwide
geographic data resource for measuring location efficiency, the SSA
found that ``Greenbelt promotes greatest use of transit compared to
Landover and Springfield.'' \9\

Question 4.c. Was there any review or evaluation of impacts to
traffic patterns given the frequency in which FBI personnel travel to
Quantico or given where a majority of FBI personnel live?
Answer. Please refer to the responses to Questions 4.a and 4.b,
above.

Question 5. In March 2023, GSA hosted consultations with Maryland
and Virginia officials. During the consultation with Maryland
officials, GSA was requested to modify the site selection process by
applying equal weights to all criteria; eliminating distance to
Quantico and non-consolidating facilities as a factor is Criterion #1;
modifying the evaluation of equity in Criterion #4 to be identical to
the standard used in other criteria; and evaluating full costs,
including full relocation costs for all tenants.\10\ In July 2023, an
amendment was issued to the Site Selection Plan which decreased the
weight of FBI mission requirements, including distance from Quantico,
and increased points for Promoting Sustainable Siting and Advancing
Equity as well as Cost.

Maryland Consultation (Mar. 8, 2023) (on file with Committee).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 5.a. What recommendations, if any, did Virginia make to
the Site Selection process during its consultation in March 2023?
Answer. The Site Selection Panel received a package of information
and data pertaining to the three sites, including information provided
by the State of Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia. Any
recommendations, comments, and submissions from either Maryland or
Virginia are contained in those documents.

Question 5.b. Was Virginia given an opportunity to respond directly
to the recommendations of the Maryland officials?
Answer. Please refer to the responses to Question 5.a, above.

Question 5.c. Were the costs associated with the wetlands in the
Greenbelt site factored in?
Answer. As noted above, the final Site Selection Plan, which was
developed in coordination with the FBI and after consultations with the
Maryland and Virginia delegations, established the process under which
the Site Selection Authority (``SSA'') would render her decision. Under
the plan, various cost elements were evaluated under Criteria #5: Cost.
The Site Selection Plan indicated that the following four cost elements
would be added together:

Cost of Site Acquisition;

Cost of Site Preparation;

Cost of Off-Site Improvements; and

Relative Cost Differences of Expected Construction Start
Dates.

However, as noted in the site selection decision, the SSA did
assess the site area and site geometry of each site under Evaluation
Criteria #3 (Site Development Flexibility and Schedule Risk). In the
agency's final decision, the SSA noted that, ``I rated Greenbelt the
third most advantageous site (Yellow) to the Government because it has
the smallest buildable area of the three sites. Moreover, it has more
restrictive site conditions, such as existing wetlands and nearby
transit facilities.'' \11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ Site Selection Decision at 24.

Question 5.c.i. If so, how much did the presence of wetlands impact
the costs to develop on that site.
Answer. Please refer to the responses to Question 5.c, above.

Question 5.c.ii. If not, please explain why the presence of
wetlands was not factored into the total costs.
Answer. Please refer to the responses to Question 5.c, above.

Question 5.d. Specifically, who at GSA was involved in making the
decisions to amend the Site Selection plan and how the plan was
amended?
Answer. As has been previously shared with the Committee, the post-
consultation process plan outlined the decision makers regarding
potential amendments to the Site Selection Plan. Specifically, given
the significant scrutiny that would attend the decision to make any
changes, or not make any changes, that consisted of a Leadership team
of the PBS Commissioner, the NCR Regional Administrator, the Chief of
Staff, and the General Counsel. These decision-makers were supported by
a Project Team consisting of the PBS Regional Commissioner, PBS
Regional Director of the Office of Real Estate Delivery, PBS Project
Executive, the Contracting Officer, the Associate General Counsel for
Real Property, and the NCR Regional Counsel. The Project Team was
tasked with ``lead[ing] the development of options grounded in GSA's
best practices.'' The Leadership Team was tasked with ``decid[ing]
which option should be selected for the Site Selection Plan.'' All of
the agency's post-consultation deliberative materials have been
provided to the Committee and have also been posted to GSA's Electronic
FOIA Reading Room.

Question 6. In the documents produced by GSA to the Committee in
response to the December 14, 2023, letter sent from Chairman Sam Graves
and myself, documents showed there were clearly communications between
Maryland and Virginia officials and GSA.
Question 6.a. Can you provide a breakdown of the number and nature
of the communications and meetings with officials of or representatives
of each State?
Answer. As a general matter, and as eventually directed by
Congress, GSA engaged in a robust dialogue with representatives from
Virginia and Maryland. Those communications generally occurred from May
2022 through July 2023 and were mainly conducted through email,
telephone, and in-person meetings. GSA offered representatives from
both Maryland and Virginia numerous opportunities to provide
information and data on all sites. Available written communications
between GSA and representatives from Maryland and Virginia regarding
the FBI headquarters project have already been provided to the
Committee.

Question 6.b. Was the Site Selection Authority (SSA), former Public
Buildings Commissioner Nina Albert, included in any of these
communications and/or meetings and, if so, which?
Answer. Please refer to the responses to Question 5.a, above. Of
note to the Committee, Ms. Albert attended the statutorily-directed
consultations with representatives from Maryland and Virginia, which
occurred on March 8-9, 2023, in Washington, DC.

Questions to Elliot D. Doomes, Commissioner, Public Buildings Service,
U.S. General Services Administration, from Hon. Steve Cohen

Odell Horton Building--Feasibility Study
Question 1. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024
(P.L. 118-42), which was signed into law on March 9, 2024, includes
language that directs GSA to conduct a feasibility study for the
current occupants of the Odell Horton Federal Building in Memphis,
Tennessee (Page 73 of the accompanying Explanatory Statement, S. Rept.
118-61 [https://www.congress.gov/118/crpt/srpt61/CRPT-118srpt61.pdf]).
Question 1.a. It is my understanding that GSA will use funds
provided by the P.L. 118-47 to conduct that study, which will consider
the cost of repairs and alterations, as well as other alternatives such
as new construction or the acquisition of new space by lease, purchase,
or exchange.
Answer. GSA funds feasibility studies in concert with the
priorities of the Judicial Conference of the United States. The
Judicial Conference has not approved or requested that GSA conduct a
feasibility study in Memphis, TN. Should the Judicial Conference
request a study for Memphis, it would be seventh in line for completion
in accordance with judicial policy. Given the priorities set by the
Judicial Conference, GSA does not plan to undertake the Odell Horton
feasibility study in fiscal year 2024. To discuss this issue in more
detail, we recommend a joint briefing with your staff, the
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, and GSA.

Question 1.b. Given that the Space and Facilities committee has
already approved eight feasibility studies that have not yet occurred,
will the feasibility study for the Odell Horton Building occur before
or after the approved feasibility studies?
Answer. The Judicial Conference of the United States utilizes an
approved planning process to identify and prioritize potential
locations for GSA to conduct initial feasibility studies. Currently,
there are eight locations on the list of judiciary requested studies.
Two of the eight locations have been completed: Dallas, TX, and
Sherman/Plano, TX. The Judicial Conference has neither approved nor
requested GSA to conduct a feasibility study in Memphis, TN.

Question 1.c. If the study is to move to the top of the list, when
will the feasibility study begin, and how long is it expected to take?
Answer. The Judicial Conference of the United States utilizes an
approved planning process to identify and prioritize potential
locations for GSA to conduct initial feasibility studies. Currently,
there are eight locations on the list of judiciary requested studies.
The Judicial Conference has neither approved nor requested GSA to
conduct a feasibility study in Memphis, TN. That being said, GSA
estimates that a feasibility study for the Odell Horton Federal
Building in Memphis, TN, as outlined in the Senate Report 118-61, would
take approximately 18 to 24 months to complete.

Questions to Nicholas Dimos, Assistant Director, Finance and Facilities
Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation, from Hon. Steve Cohen

Memphis Field Office
Question 1. As you reference in your testimony, in Fiscal Year
2019, the FBI requested and received Congressional Appropriations
Committee approval through the congressional relocation reporting (CRR)
process to combine the Memphis and Knoxville field offices into one
centrally located Nashville field office. Although some personnel will
remain in Memphis and Knoxville (as resident agency facilities), many
personnel will relocate to the new Nashville field office.
Question 1.a. What is the exact number of personnel that will be
relocated from Memphis to Nashville?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 1.b. Considering your testimony referenced the change was
based on population growth patterns across the State of Tennessee and
