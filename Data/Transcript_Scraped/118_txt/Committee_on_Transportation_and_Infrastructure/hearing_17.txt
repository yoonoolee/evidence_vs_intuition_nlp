SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Water Resources and
Environment
FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Water Resources and
Environment
RE:      LSubcommittee Hearing on ``The Next Fifty Years of
the Clean Water Act: Examining the Law and Infrastructure
Project Completion''
_______________________________________________________________________

I. PURPOSE

The Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment of the
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, will meet on
Tuesday, May 16, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. ET in 2167 of the Rayburn
House Office Building to receive testimony on ``The Next Fifty
Years of the Clean Water Act: Examining the Law and
Infrastructure Project Completion.'' At the hearing Members
will receive testimony from witnesses representing the National
Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA), the National
Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the state of North Dakota,
and the state of Maryland. The hearing will examine the Clean
Water Act (CWA), and how to modernize the CWA to protect water
quality, while ensuring the completion of projects, reducing
supply chain challenges, and promoting commerce.

II. BACKGROUND

CWA JURISDICTION

The Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment
(Subcommittee) maintains jurisdiction over several agencies,
including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the
United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). Specifically,
the Subcommittee in its capacity overseeing laws governing
water quality and wastewater infrastructure, holds jurisdiction
over EPA and the Corps as they regulate activities related to
water quality. Additionally, the Subcommittee maintains sole
jurisdiction of the CWA, the Federal Government's primary
statutory tool for protecting the water quality of the Nation's
navigable waters.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ H. Comm. on Transp. & Infrastructure, Jurisdiction and
Activities of the Subcomm. on Water Resources and Environment, 118Th
Cong., (2023) (on file with Comm.) [hereinafter Jurisdiction and
Activities Report].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CWA provides a major Federal-state program as the
principal law governing water quality of the Nation's surface
waters.\2\ Congress enacted the 1972 amendments to the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act, commonly referred to as the CWA,
with the objective to ``restore and maintain the chemical,
physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.''
\3\ To achieve this objective, two goals were established: (1)
to eliminate pollutant discharge into navigable waters by 1985,
and (2) where possible, to ensure water quality that is
``fishable'' and ``swimmable'' by 1983.\4\

Summary of the Law, (Updated Oct. 18, 2016), available at https://
www.crs.gov/Reports/RL30030 [hereinafter CRS Report RL30030].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CWA consists of two major parts: (1) the authorization
of financial assistance for construction of municipal
wastewater treatment plants, and (2) the regulatory
requirements that apply to those who discharge into navigable
waters, including industrial and municipal actors.\5\ Planning,
financial, and technical assistance for various regions and
issues are also addressed.\6\ This SSM focuses primarily on key
sections of the CWA that have produced substantial interest for
legislative action related to expediting the completion of
infrastructure projects.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CWA REGULATORY AUTHORITY BACKGROUND

Title III of the CWA establishes the authority for the
technological and water quality-based effluent limitation
guidelines that must be abided by point source dischargers.\7\
Whereas Title III of the CWA largely focuses on the creation of
water quality guidelines and limitations, Title IV primarily
deals with application of the regulatory program, informed by
the guidelines created pursuant to Title III, through which
dischargers must receive permits or certifications.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ See CRS Report RL30030, supra note 4; see also CWA, supra note
3, Sec. 301-320.
\8\ See CRS Report RL30030, supra note 4; see also CWA, supra note
3, Sec. 401, 402, 404.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to achieve its objectives, the CWA is predicated
on the principle that discharges into waters of the United
States are only lawful if authorized by a permit.\9\ Therefore,
the application of various CWA components require a regulatory
program. While certain regulatory programs under the law may
only be carried out by the Federal Government, through either
EPA or the Corps, certain responsibilities can be assumed by
states approved by EPA.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ See CRS Report RL30030, supra note 4.
\10\ See e.g. CWA, supra note 3, Sec. Sec.  401, 402, 404.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CWA ACTION IN THE 118TH CONGRESS

The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
(Committee) has already acted on a number of CWA-related issues
this Congress. For example, the Committee took actions in
response to the Biden Administration's definition of waters of
the United States (WOTUS), which governs the application of CWA
programs.\11\ Following the release of EPA and the Corps' final
``Revised Definition of the `Waters of the United States' ''
rule on December 30, 2022, the Subcommittee held a hearing and
received testimony from interested stakeholders on February 8,
2023.\12\ In response to the Biden Administration's revised
WOTUS definition, Chairman Sam Graves and Water Resources and
Environment Subcommittee Chairman David Rouzer introduced H.J.
Res. 27, Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter
8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the
Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, Department of
Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency relating to
``Revised Definition of `Waters of the United States' ''.\13\
The Committee favorably reported H.J. Res. 27 to the House on
February 28, 2023.\14\ The resolution then passed the House on
March 9, 2023, and the Senate on March 29, 2023. H.J. Res. 27
was then vetoed by President Biden, after which the House voted
and failed to override the veto.\15\

Additionally, on February 28, 2023, the Committee favorably
reported H.R. 1152, the Water Quality Certification and Energy
Project Improvement Act to the House.\16\ The goal of this
legislation is to promote the development of the Nation's
infrastructure by amending the permitting process under Section
401 of the CWA and focusing Section 401 on CWA water
quality.\17\ Section 401 of the CWA requires applicants seeking
a Federal permit or license for an activity that may result in
discharge into navigable waters to obtain a water quality
certification from the state or tribe with the jurisdiction of
the area of possible discharge.\18\ These activities include
projects under Sections 402 and 404 of the CWA, the Rivers and
Harbors Act, as well as from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC).\19\ H.R. 1152 was included in H.R. 1, the
Lower Energy Costs Act, which passed the House on March 30,
2023.\20\

Although both issues and pieces of legislation are relevant
to CWA implementation, this Subcommittee hearing will primarily
focus on other key sections of the CWA. The regulatory
processes of the CWA are of particular interest to the
Subcommittee at a time when the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act (IIJA) (P.L. 117-58) has provided large investments
into the United States' infrastructure, including water
infrastructure spending under the Clean Water State Revolving
Fund (Clean Water SRF), and other infrastructure modes, such as
roads, bridges, dams, and energy.\21\ Specifically, industry
stakeholders are urging lawmakers to accelerate the project
permitting process across infrastructure sectors and to deliver
projects, on-time and on-budget, so that communities can
realize project benefits as quickly as possible and to keep up
with global competitors, such as China.\22\

III. SECTION 402: NATIONAL POLLUTANT DISCHARGE ELIMINTATION SYSTEM
(NPDES)

Section 402 of the CWA authorizes the NPDES program for
regulation of discharges of pollutants from point sources into
navigable waters.\23\ Point sources are defined as ``any
discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, such as a pipe,
ditch, channel, conduit, discrete fissure, or container,'' and
also include ``vessels or other floating craft'' from which
pollutants may be discharged.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\23\ CWA, supra note 3, Sec. 402; see also CRS Report R46927 supra
note 11; see generally also EPA, NPDES Permit Basics, available at
https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-basics [Hereinafter NPDES Permit
Basics].
\24\ NPDES Permit Basics, supra note 23.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since all point source dischargers are subject to the NPDES
program, a total of more than 65,000 industrial and municipal
conventional dischargers are required to obtain permits
pursuant to Section 402.\25\ In addition, NPDES permits are
required for stormwater discharges from industrial and
municipal sources, including over 150,000 individual
sources.\26\ NPDES permits require the point source to attain
technology-based effluent limits, while specifying the
numerical effluent limitations that sources must meet in order
to guarantee water quality where possible, and date of
compliance.\27\ EPA is responsible for defining the level of
treatment required for municipalities and various types of
industries, as well as for developing minimum water quality
criteria specifying the maximum concentrations of pollutants
permitted for different designated uses of waters.\28\

\25\ CRS Report RL30030, supra note 4.
\26\ Id.
\27\ Id.
\28\ Jurisdiction and Activities Report, supra note 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NPDES permits are issued for up to five years and must be
renewed thereafter if discharge is to continue.\29\ However, if
the permittee provides a complete application, but is not
reissued a permit prior the date of expiration, the permit may
be ``administratively continued.'' \30\ Permit applications are
considered backlogged for new applications if they are not
issued or denied within 365 days of receipt, and for extensions
if they are administratively continued for 180 days or
more.\31\ As of September 2021, there were 284 permits under
the responsibility of EPA (e.g., in the States and territories
under EPA-authority) awaiting reissuance in backlog and 22 new
permit applications in backlog.\32\ While EPA has not formally
documented the number of administratively continued permits
issued by states with approved NPDES permit programs since
fiscal year 2017, at that time, approximately 14,000 facilities
were in possession of permits requiring reissuance.\33\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NPDES permit renewals must complete an application for renewal at least
180 days prior to original expiration).

backlog_report_card-sum.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While EPA runs its own NPDES permitting program, the CWA
authorizes EPA to approve individual states and tribes to
manage their own NPDES permitting programs, in keeping with the
CWA's intent of Federal-state partnership.\34\ In order to be
approved to manage a NPDES permit program, a state must meet
specific requirements, including developing water quality
standards. States may use either EPA's water quality standards,
or different standards approved by EPA, if the state
demonstrates to EPA that the differences are warranted and not
inconsistent with the CWA antidegradation policy.\35\ Nearly
all states have assumed administration of their own NPDES
permitting programs, with only three exceptions: Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, and New Mexico.\36\

Point sources may in some instances apply for a NPDES
general permit as opposed to a NPDES individual permit. A NPDES
individual permit is written for site-specific discharges that
are unique to a specific location or discharge.\37\ On the
other hand, NPDES general permits cover ``multiple dischargers
with similar operations and types of discharges,'' such as
pesticide use or stormwater discharge.\38\ Obtaining coverage
under a general permit is often quicker than an individual
permit, with point sources submitting a Notice of Intent (NOI)
to be covered under a general permit after it is issued by a
permitting authority.\39\

IV. SECTION 404: DREDGED AND FILL MATERIAL

Section 404 of the CWA authorizes a separate type of permit
required to discharge dredged or fill materials into navigable
waters. Activities covered under the Section 404 program
include those associated with pipeline projects; water
resources projects such as levees and dams; mining projects
such as those for critical minerals; infrastructure development
such as highways and airports; and other development.\40\ Some
activities are exempt from Section 404 permitting requirements,
such as certain farming and forestry activities.\41\ Section
404 permits are typically issued for a term of five years.\42\

\42\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPA and the Corps play complementary roles in implementing
the Section 404 program, with the Corps in charge of issuing
permits for discharge of dredged or fill material, using a set
of environmental guidelines promulgated by EPA in conjunction
with the Corps to evaluate permit applications.\43\ The Corps
likewise administers the day-to-day program, including
jurisdictional determinations (JD) which certify the presence
or absence of waters subject to the CWA.\44\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similar to the NPDES permitting process, EPA may also allow
states and tribes to assume authority to grant or deny dredge
and fill permits under Section 404, under the condition that
states or tribes develop a wetlands permit program consistent
with the CWA.\45\ Currently three states have assumed authority
over their Section 404 program: Florida, Michigan, and New
Jersey.\46\

\46\ See CRS Report R46927, supra note 11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pursuant to Section 404, the Corps issues two types of
permits: general and individual. The CWA authorizes the
issuance of general permits for discharges that are ``similar
in nature, will cause only minimal adverse environmental
effects when performed separately, and will have only minimal
cumulative adverse effect on the environment'' and are issued
on a nationwide, regional, or state basis for particular
categories of activities.\47\ Nationwide Permits (NWPs) and
Regional General Permits are issued by the Corps on a National
basis and are designed to ``enhance regulatory efficiency and
provide clarity for the regulated public without decreasing
environmental protections.'' \48\ The most recent reissuance of
NWPs went into effect in February 2022, covering 59 distinct
activity categories, including mooring buoys, residential
developments, utility lines, road crossings, and mining
activities.\49\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 404 also authorizes EPA to restrict, prohibit,
deny, or withdraw the specification by the Corps of a site for
the discharge of dredged or fill material, if the agency
determines that the discharge will have an unacceptable adverse
effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery
areas, wildlife, or recreational areas.\50\ Section 404(c) is
commonly referred to as EPA's ``veto authority.'' Since the
CWA's enactment, EPA has issued fourteen 404(c) determinations,
most recently for the Pebble Deposit Area in Alaska.\51\

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID ROUZER OF NORTH CAROLINA,
CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON WATER RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT

Mr. Rouzer. For just over half a century, the Clean Water
Act has functioned to improve the quality of rivers, lakes, and
streams throughout the country. Congress recognized that we had
a major issue with the quality of our Nation's waters and
understood the many benefits that are derived from access to
clean, navigable waters.
North Carolina's Seventh Congressional District, which I am
honored to represent, is known for its beautiful waterways and
beaches that provide significant recreational and economic
benefits. We also have many important bodies of water that we
rely on for commerce and drinking water.
The Clean Water Act has had great success in its 50 years
protecting waters in North Carolina and all around the country.
We should be proud of the progress we have made to restore and
maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of
the Nation's waters.
And it is important that we not ignore innovation and other
major changes that have occurred since Congress passed the
Clean Water Act back in 1972. Now, more than 50 years following
its enactment, it is not only appropriate but necessary to
reflect on how the Clean Water Act works and what parts of it
might need an update. There is no better place to start that
review than right here in this subcommittee.
Now, as we all know, the United States frequently scores
poorly on infrastructure reports. We are being outmaneuvered by
our competitors worldwide, China in particular. Now, we
certainly all agree that there should be rules of the road, but
as I like to say, we don't need a stop light every 10 feet like
we have, literally, here in Washington, DC, on some streets in
particular.
Regulations should be simple to understand and easy to
follow, which, coincidentally, makes them so much easier to
enforce. Our worldwide competitors care little to nothing about
any regulatory structure or permitting. When they want to do
something, they just go do it. Now, we are better than that, of
course, and we should be. But it doesn't mean we should be
forced to accept a timeline of years to build a manufacturing
plant or to build a wastewater treatment plant or energy
project. All this does is give our international competitors a
distinct and significant advantage.
Regulations should carry out the intent of the law
transparently and not leave regulated communities, whether it
be miners, utility companies, State and local governments,
manufacturers, or any other hard-working American, subject to
bureaucratic uncertainty or line the pockets of trial lawyers.
American innovation, greatness, and competitiveness cannot be
achieved when the country is stuck in a bureaucratic quagmire.
Today, the subcommittee will hear perspectives on how the
Clean Water Act can be modernized so that its rules and
regulations fit the current times, while still accomplishing
the goal of making waters of the United States fishable and
swimmable. Ensuring the completion of important infrastructure
and energy development projects--for things like wastewater
management, the mining of critical minerals, and water
resources development--is vital to reducing supply chain
challenges and promoting commerce. In doing so, we can reassert
American strength and compete worldwide while protecting the
quality of our water all at the same time.
This hearing is the latest action we are taking to examine
and modernize the Clean Water Act. This morning, we have a
knowledgeable panel of witnesses representing a diverse array
of interests who are all affected by the Clean Water Act,
including wastewater agencies, manufacturers, and State
governments.
This panel of stakeholders is well-versed on the details of
Clean Water Act regulations. Our focus today is on two of the
main regulatory provisions of the CWA: section 402, the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program; and
section 404, the dredged and fill material discharge program.
I am eager to hear from our witnesses about their
experiences with the CWA regulations and their ideas on how to
improve and update it for the benefit of everyone. In
particular, I look forward to hearing their comments on the
NPDES program, including the creation of guidelines on effluent
limitations; section 404 issues, such as nationwide permits;
and any other insights into the CWA programs they may have,
especially as it relates to responsibly advancing energy and
infrastructure project completion.
[Mr. Rouzer's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. David Rouzer, a Representative in Congress

of pollutants into our water systems.
I look forward to hearing from you, our panelists, on the NPDES
program, including on the creation of effluent limitations guidelines,
Section 404 issues such as Nationwide Permits, and any other insights
into CWA programs you may have, especially as it relates to responsibly
advancing energy and infrastructure project completion.

Mr. Rouzer. I ask unanimous consent to enter into the

National Mining Association, dated May 16, 2023.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent to enter into the record two

[The information follows:]

Statement of the National Mining Association, Submitted for the Record
by Hon. David Rouzer
The National Mining Association (NMA) appreciates the opportunity
to provide input to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
regarding the future of permitting and the Clean Water Act (CWA). The
NMA's members support and conduct mining operations throughout the
United States. In an era of intense global competition, U.S. mining
operators, including small businesses, need regulatory clarity and
certainty to make confident decisions that will create jobs, strengthen
local economies, and create high quality, American-made goods and
services. This includes metallurgical coal for steelmaking and critical
infrastructure, thermal coal for heating and energy both at home and to
our allies abroad, and hardrock minerals such as copper that support
renewable energy technologies, healthcare, and more.
The NMA is the only national trade organization that serves as the
voice of the U.S. mining industry and the hundreds of thousands of
American workers it employs before Congress. We work to ensure America
has secure and reliable supply chains, abundant and affordable energy,
and the American-sourced materials necessary for U.S. manufacturing,
national security and economic security, all delivered under world-
leading environmental, safety and labor standards. The NMA has a
membership of more than 275 companies and organizations involved in
every aspect of mining, from producers and equipment manufacturers to
service providers.
Background
Coal is a reliable and abundant energy resource--making up nearly
90 percent of U.S. fossil energy reserves on a Btu basis. The demand
for coal, especially coal exports, has remained steady and even
increased. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has severely shaken global coal
markets and last year triggered a spike in U.S. thermal coal exports to
help alleviate Europe's tight energy supply and low natural gas
reserves.
Key infrastructure, including roads, railways, buildings, stadiums,
bridges, airports and other structures are all supported by steel--a
material dependent on metallurgical coal. Seventy percent of the
world's steel requires coal for its production. The U.S. is one of the
largest metallurgical coal exporters in the world and demand is
expected to increase 20 percent by 2030 to keep up with the pace of
aging infrastructure.
Hardrock mined materials, including copper, nickel and lithium are
widely recognized as commodities for which the demand will
exponentially increase over the next several decades--in some cases
between 500 and 1,000 percent. Key western mining states, such as
Nevada, Arizona and Utah are all expected to play a pivotal role in
securing our domestic supply chains for these and other minerals that
are needed for renewable energy technologies, defense purposes and
electric vehicles.
American coal and hardrock producers are reliant on efficient,
predictable and durable CWA regulations and guidance that maintains
federal and state cooperation. Unfortunately, CWA requirements have
become more complex, especially as litigation has increased. Over the
last several decades, the result has been more costly and lengthy
permitting processes bound by uncertainty of timeline and approval
outcomes for CWA permit holders.
Recommendations
The NMA urges Congress to use its authority to ensure congressional
intent is maintained and to prevent regulatory overreach that
ultimately hinders U.S. energy and mineral supply chains. It is
essential that domestic miners can continue to responsibly produce
domestic coal that utilities rely on to power our communities and heat
and cool our homes. We must be able to provide metallurgical coal to
the industries that repair roads, bridges and buildings to keep our
infrastructure safe and reliable. We must ensure that our hardrock
mineral production can ramp up to meet market demand for nearly every
U.S. industry and for the innovative technologies that will help power
our future.
Several components of the CWA underpin the activities mentioned
above. In addition to legislative actions already taken by the
committee to ensure predictability and effectiveness of permitting
processes, including efforts to clarify section 401 and ``waters of the
United States'' (WOTUS), the NMA recommends Congress prioritize the
following additional proposed CWA reforms:

Set clear limits on preemptive and retroactive 404(c)
veto authority: The Environmental Protection Agency has in the past
used its veto authority preemptively to restrict development of
proposed energy and mineral projects before any applications for a 404
permit have ever been filed with the agency, and retroactively after
permitted projects had already been operating for years. Ultimately,
this undermines the private sector investment climate in the U.S. for
mining and other capital-intensive projects and the good-paying jobs
they would create.

Maintain five-year validity of U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers Approved Jurisdictional Determinations (AJDs): An AJD should
remain valid for permitting purposes for five years in accordance with
RGL No. 05-02 and the Supreme Court's holding in U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers v. Hawkes, regardless of whether the definition of WOTUS
changes during that time. Without this certainty, the increased cost of
permitting and associated cost of delays will further disincentivize
future investment opportunities for small businesses throughout the
U.S.

Streamline compensatory mitigation process: The high cost
and lack of available compensatory mitigation credits can prevent a
proposed project from moving forward. Streamlining the compensatory
mitigation review and approval process to make more credits available
at an affordable rate in the marketplace would help ensure important
projects can be completed.

Develop guardrails to increase clarity for aquatic
resource of national importance (ARNI) designations: An ARNI is a
resource-based threshold used to determine whether a dispute between
EPA and the Corps regarding individual permit cases are eligible for
elevation under a 1992 404(q) memorandum of understanding. While ARNI
is not a designation found under the CWA, the EPA uses its authority to
determine this on a case-by-case basis. The lack of definition and
broad authority given to EPA under this MOU can increase delays in
permitting and raise costs by requiring higher than necessary
mitigation ratios.

Ensure any EPA guidance on CWA section 402 NPDES
permitting requirements for groundwater is released for public notice
and comment: In 2020, the Supreme Court in County of Maui v. Hawaii
Wildlife Fund created a test to determine whether a discharge from a
point source to a WOTUS via groundwater is the ``functional
equivalent'' of a direct discharge and therefore requires permittees to
obtain a CWA section 402 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit. We understand EPA is nearing completion of draft
guidance that would advise permittees when it may be necessary to
obtain a section 402 NPDES permit. We urge Congress to ensure that EPA
allows the regulated community and other stakeholders the opportunity
to provide comment on the guidance.

Clarify the scope of CWA section 402(k), the NPDES
``permit shield'': Under CWA Sec. 402(k), known as the ``permit
shield'' provision, if a permittee discharges in compliance with its
NPDES permit, it is shielded from CWA liability. Unfortunately,
litigation involving this critical protection has increased in multiple
states by parties attempting to limit the scope of the permit shield
defense. We encourage Congress to clarify that permittees are shielded
from liability under lawfully issued NPDES permits. This clarification
will help ensure legal and regulatory certainty.

Ensure the development of CWA section 304(a) water
quality criteria and implementation materials are transparent and
subject to notice and comment rulemaking and judicial review: EPA
develops water quality criteria, which are then generally adopted into
state standards and put into all NPDES permits. Because water quality
criteria trigger permitting requirements, their development should be
transparent and informed by the regulated community and other
stakeholders through public notice and comment.

Ensure CWA section 402 NPDES permits have clear terms:
NPDES permit writers often use ambiguous terms, which can then be used
improperly in litigation. We encourage Congress to clarify that any
effluent limitation in a permit clearly identifies the specific
pollutant to which it applies, and either the numeric values or
waterbody conditions that permit holders must meet. This clarity will
ensure permit holders know what is expected of them for compliance
purposes and would provide regulatory certainty.

The NMA appreciates the committee's attention to the issue of
effective permitting and ensuring the preservation of our water
resources. We look forward to engaging and supporting the committee in
its effort to address these and other related CWA issues.

Letter of May 15, 2023, to Hon. David Rouzer, Chairman, and Hon. Grace
F. Napolitano, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Resources and
Environment, from Amanda E. Eversole, Executive Vice President and
Chief Advocacy Officer, American Petroleum Institute, Submitted for the
Record by Hon. David Rouzer
May 15, 2023.
The Honorable David Rouzer,
Chair,
Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, 2165 Rayburn House
Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Grace Napolitano,
Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, 2165 Rayburn House
Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano:
The American Petroleum Institute (API) writes regarding the
upcoming Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee Hearing: ``The
Next Fifty Years of the Clean Water Act: Examining the Law and
Infrastructure Project Completion'' on Tuesday, May 16, 2023.
API is committed to meeting the challenge of providing affordable
and reliable energy while continuing to reduce emissions. As the
leading trade association representing the entire value chain of the
U.S. oil and natural gas industry, API supports policies that
strengthen our nation's energy security and economy and protect our
environment. We commend the Committee for holding a hearing on May 16,
which will consider an important topic related to these objectives.
Investments to modernize infrastructure, including expanding
current capacity and building new capacity, can help ensure that energy
remains affordable for American consumers, create good-paying jobs,
give U.S. manufacturers a competitive advantage through lower energy
and raw material costs, and provide revenue to local, state and federal
governments. Yet, decades-long challenges with the existing permitting
process have hampered the development of critical infrastructure
projects and jeopardized American energy security.
Many of those permits are issued at the state or federal level
under the Clean Water Act (CWA) when a project may impact navigable
waters. The permitting process can take years, and those delays can
lead to skyrocketing project costs or even cancellation. API urges
Congress to pass meaningful permitting reform legislation that includes
changes to the CWA that will create a more conducive environment for
moving critical projects forward, while still maintaining important
environmental reviews and stakeholder engagement.
With respect to the CWA, we recommend that water quality
certifications reviewed and issued by states, tribes or EPA under
Section 401 should be limited to direct water quality impacts from
point source discharges to navigable waters and should not be used by
certifying agencies to veto critical energy projects. API commends the
House for previously addressing the permitting process and clarifying
the focus on water quality under Section 401 through the passage of
H.R. l. Additionally, the Nationwide Permit (NWP) Program under Section
404 should be reformed to address the ongoing viability of the program,
extend the reissuance period and address authority of the Army Corps of
Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
To that end, we make the following recommendations for CWA
permitting reform:
Section 401:

Clarify that it applies only to federal activity--Need
for certification arises only when a federally licensed or permitted
activity has the potential to result in a discharge from a point source
into a ``water of the United States.''

Scope of reviews--Certification review is limited to
water quality impacts from the discharge only that would result from
the federally permitted or licensed activity itself--not from other
sources or from the ``activity as a whole.''

Start of the clock--Certification review period commences
upon the date of the certifying authority's receipt of a request for
certification, and this review period cannot exceed one year.

Prohibit withdrawal/resubmit--Certifying authorities
should not be allowed to recommend withdrawal and resubmission of
applications to restart the one-year time review requirement.

Clear application requirements--Require states to publish
requirements for certification requests and require states to notify
applicants within 30 days of receipt of application whether the states
have all the materials needed to process a certification request.

Determinations--Final decisions on whether to grant,
grant with conditions or deny a request for certification must be in
writing and based only on local water quality reasons, and certifying
authorities must provide rationale for decision.

Conditions--Each certification condition should be
supported by an explanation for why the condition is necessary to
certify compliance with water quality requirements and supported with a
citation to applicable legal requirements that protect water quality.
Section 404:

NWP renewals--Extend the reissuance cycle for NWPs from
five to ten years, which would help provide increased regulatory
certainty for project developers and avoid potential disruption to
critical infrastructure projects.

Confined EPA Authority--Ensure that EPA does not pre-
emptively bar potential activities requiring a CWA Section 404 permit
before there is an applicant or a project; for EPA to make a veto
determination under 404(c), an entity must apply for an actual Section
404 permit with the Corps.

One NWP--To help ensure predictability for project
developers, clarify that one linear project can be authorized under one
NWP, even if there are multiple owners or developers and even if there
are multiple crossings of the same water body in different places or
multiple water bodies in the same location.

Consultation--Because the Corps' issuance and reissuance
of NWP 12 is limited to only those activities that have ``no effect''
on listed species or designated critical habitat, clarify that
consultation under the Endangered Species Act is not required.

Use for oil/pipelines--Ensure that the Administration
maintains NWP 12 for activities associated with oil and natural gas
pipelines that do not result in the loss of greater than \1/2\ acre of
Waters of the United States for each single and complete project.

Judicial review--Include a provision to ensure that an
action seeking judicial review of an individual or general permit under
section 404 must be filed no later than 60 days from the date the
permit is issued. In addition, ensure that if a federal court remands
or vacates a permit under section 404, the issuer of the permit must
act on the remand or vacatur no later than 180 days from the date the
permit is remanded or vacated. In addition, ensure that those permits
already approved as of the date of enactment are not subject to
challenge.

Applying these reforms to Section 401 and 404 of the CWA will help
create a more conducive environment for moving critical projects
forward by providing a more transparent, timely and consistent process.
API looks forward to working with Congress to advance meaningful
bipartisan permitting reform this year. If you have any questions,
please contact Emily Wong on our Federal Relations staff.
Sincerely,
Amanda E. Eversole,
Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy Officer,
American Petroleum Institute.

Transportation and Infrastructure

Letter of May 15, 2023, to Hon. David Rouzer, Chairman, Subcommittee on
Water Resources and Environment, from Michael W. Johnson, President and
Chief Executive Officer, National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association,
Submitted for the Record by Hon. David Rouzer
May 15, 2023.
The Honorable David Rouzer,
Chairman,
Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment.
Dear Chairman Rouzer and Members of the Subcommittee on Water
Resources and Environment,
On behalf of the 400 members of the National Stone, Sand & Gravel
Association (NSSGA), I am writing to you in light of the upcoming
hearing, ``The Next Fifty Years of the Clean Water Act: Examining the
Law and Infrastructure Project Completion,'' scheduled for Tuesday, May
16, 2023.
NSSGA proudly represents the nation's aggregates industry, which
conducts over 9,000 operations and employs over 100,000 citizens
annually that create 2.5 billion tons of aggregates each year. These
raw materials are essential to rebuild and repair our country's aging
infrastructure and assist our nation's goals in lowering the overall
energy cost for families.
Our members, who represent the largest volume of natural materials
producers in the United States, are integral to the construction and
maintenance of the nation's infrastructure. Aggregate materials,
including sand, gravel, crushed stone, and others, are indispensable to
public works projects involving water treatment systems, flood control,
and stream restoration. These materials also play a crucial role in
purifying our drinking water, underlining their importance to both
public health and environmental sustainability.
However, our members' capacity to contribute to these critical
projects is currently threatened by the latest WOTUS rule, which is an
unclear, overly expansive, and arbitrary interpretations of the Clean
Water Act (CWA). While the CWA is an essential instrument for
protecting our water resources, the ambiguous interpretation,
particularly regarding the definition of `waters of the United States,'
has created a climate of uncertainty for aggregate producers. This is
especially problematic given the regulatory patchwork where 3 courts
have put the rule on hold due to its overreach and lack of clarity.
This makes it even harder given the purportedly ``durable'' rule is
anything but, and regulators and the public are even more confused
about what features are jurisdictional. NSSGA has members who have been
trying to permit projects for years under multiple rules.
This situation could potentially delay or halt essential projects
that are central to public health, the economy, and the environment.
Unclear guidance impedes the effective use of aggregate materials,
undermining our collective goal of sustainable development and
environmental protection.
As the Subcommittee convenes to deliberate on the future of the
Clean Water Act, we implore you to consider an interpretation that
balances the Act's environmental objectives with the practical needs of
infrastructure projects. Clear and actionable guidance is needed for
industries that depend on aggregate materials, ensuring their
operations' certainty and continuity.
We believe that the upcoming hearing offers an opportunity to
strike a balance between environmental protection and infrastructure
development. We trust that the esteemed witnesses--Dr. Travnicek,
Secretary McIlwain, Mr. Conway, and Mr. Farris--will bring invaluable
insights to this discussion.
We thank you for your consideration and remain confident that your
actions will serve the best interests of our nation, contributing to a
sustainable future for our communities and a prosperous aggregate
industry.
Sincerely,
Michael W. Johnson,
President and CEO, National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association.

Mr. Rouzer. I now recognize my good friend and colleague
from California, Ranking Member Napolitano, for 5 minutes for
an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO OF CALIFORNIA,
RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON WATER RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT

Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You have
continued the subcommittee's long history of success in
addressing the bipartisan water resources needs of our Nation,
as clean water is essential to our livelihoods, our health, our
environment, and our businesses.
The strength of the American economy is reliant on a clean
water supply as it is a key ingredient for manufacturing,
farming, food processing, small business development, tourism,
and recreational businesses. If we do not protect our Nation's
water, this will have a negative impact on business as they
will not have the high-quality water they need for production
and growth. The decline of water quality will require
consumers, businesses, and residents to pay more in water
utility bills to treat the water before it comes to the tap.
And I agree with you. We should not be competing with
China, because we will have to lower our standards, and I don't
want that. This is true whether you live on a coast or in the
middle of the country, whether you live in a big city, a small
town, or whether you live in an affluent community or a
community struggling to make ends meet.
Over the past 50 years, the Clean Water Act has made
considerable progress in addressing our Nation's water quality
concerns. Through a substantial investment of resources,
spurred by Federal dollars from the Clean Water Act, this
Nation was able to fundamentally address the discharge of raw
or partially treated sewage into our rivers, streams, and
lakes.
However, challenges remain.
Over the last decade, communities and States have called
for additional Federal dollars and resources to address
lingering water quality concerns. In response, last Congress,
House Democrats delivered with enactment of the largest
investment in wastewater infrastructure in generations through
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, known as BIL. Over the 5
years covered in the BIL, this critical legislation will
provide approximately $13.8 billion in Federal clean water
resources to address the many local water quality challenges.
Further, in recognition that not all communities are on
equal financial footing, the BIL ensured that roughly half of
the funding would be provided in the form of grants or other
flexible financing to address the needs of economically
disadvantaged communities, including rural and Tribal
communities, many of which had borne the burden of
environmental contamination for far too long.
Yet, as important as wastewater infrastructure financing
might be, there are limits to what can be done relying solely
on wastewater infrastructure investment. Over the past few
years, more and more communities have experienced recurrent
outbreaks of harmful algal blooms that can produce toxins; kill
fish, mammals, and birds; contaminate drinking water sources;
and cause human illness or even death in extreme cases. And
then we have a new contaminant coming up, which is PFAS. We
have got to look out for that.
As shown on the maps on the screen, if you look at the
screen, harmful algal blooms have become a national concern
because they affect not only the health of people and marine
ecosystems, but also the health of our economy, especially
coastal communities dependent on the income of jobs generated
through fishing and tourism.
We all know that a major cause of these blooms is excessive
nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, in U.S. waters.
Unfortunately, according to State data, excessive nutrients
continue to be one of the Nation's leading water quality
issues. Today, approximately 58 percent of rivers and streams,
40 percent of lakes, and 21 percent of coastal waters are
impaired due to high levels of nutrients. You see the location
of many of these contaminated waters on the second map on the
screen.
Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent both maps be made part
of today's hearing record.
Mr. Rouzer. So ordered.
[The maps immediately follow Mrs. Napolitano's prepared
statement.]
Mrs. Napolitano. What is worse than that, according to the
EPA, the percentage of nutrient-impaired waterways is
increasing, even with substantial investment in our Nation's
wastewater infrastructure, and we need to do more. Very
clearly, we need to do more.
Unfortunately, in my opinion, every water bill advanced by
this committee in Congress would needlessly weaken Federal and
State efforts to protect our waters from pollution, such as
excessive nutrients. In my opinion, every water bill advanced
in this Congress would result in more water bodies being
impaired by contamination, such as harmful algal blooms, not
less.
Now is not the time to pull back on Federal investments on
wastewater infrastructure. Now is not the time to weaken
Federal and State efforts to protect our Nation's waters. Now
is not the time to weaken our clean water future. We cannot
regress.
I welcome our panelists here today and look forward to
their valued input.
[Mrs. Napolitano's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Grace F. Napolitano, a Representative in
Congress from the State of California, and Ranking Member, Subcommittee
on Water Resources and Environment
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This Subcommittee has a long history of success in addressing the
bipartisan water resources needs of our nation as clean water is
essential to our livelihoods, to our environment, and to our
businesses.
The strength of the American economy is reliant on a clean water
supply as it is a key ingredient for manufacturing, farming, food
processing, small business development, and tourism and recreational
businesses. If we do not protect our nation's waters, this will have a
negative impact on business as they will not have the high quality
water they need for production and growth. The decline of water quality
will require consumers, businesses, and residents to pay more in water
utility bills to treat water before it comes to the tap.
This is true whether you live along the coast or in the middle of
the country, whether you live in a big city or small town, or whether
you live in an affluent community or a community struggling to make
ends meet.
Over the past 50 years, the Clean Water Act has made considerable
progress in addressing our nation's water quality concerns.
Through a substantial investment of resources--spurred by federal
dollars from the Clean Water Act--this nation was able to fundamentally
address the discharge of raw or partially treated sewage into our
rivers, streams, and lakes.
However, challenges remain.
Over the last decade, communities and states have called for
additional federal resources to address lingering water quality
concerns.
In response, last Congress, House Democrats delivered with
enactment of the largest investment in wastewater infrastructure in
generations through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL).
Over the five years covered in the BIL, this critical legislation
will provide approximately $13.8 billion in federal clean water
resources to address local water quality challenges.
Further, in recognition that not all communities are on equal
financial footings, the BIL ensured that roughly half of the funding
would be provided in the form of grants or other flexible financing to
address the needs of economically disadvantaged communities, including
rural and tribal communities--many of which have borne the burden of
environmental contamination for too long.
Yet, as important as robust water infrastructure financing might
be, there are limits to what can be done relying solely on wastewater
infrastructure investment.
Over the past few years, more and more communities have experienced
recurring outbreaks of harmful algal blooms that can produce toxins,
kill fish, mammals, and birds, contaminate drinking water sources, and
cause human illness or even death in extreme cases.
As shown on the map on the screens, harmful algal blooms have
become a national concern because they affect not only the health of
people and marine ecosystems, but also the ``health'' of our economy--
especially coastal communities dependent on the income of jobs
generated through fishing and tourism.
We all know that a major cause these blooms is excessive
nutrients--such as nitrogen and phosphorous--in U.S. waters.
Unfortunately, according to state data, excessive nutrients continue to
be one of our nation's leading water quality issues.
Today, approximately 58 percent of rivers and streams, 40 percent
of lakes, and 21 percent of coastal waters are impaired due to high
levels of nutrients.
You can see the location of many of these contaminated waters on
this second map on the screen--and, Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous
consent that both maps be made part of today's hearing record.
What is worse is that, according to EPA data, the percentage of
nutrient impaired waterways is increasing, even with substantial
investment in our nation's wastewater infrastructure.
Clearly, more needs to be done.
Unfortunately, in my opinion, every water bill advanced by this
Committee in this Congress would needlessly weaken federal and state
efforts to protect our waters from pollution, such as excessive
nutrients.
In my opinion, every water bill advanced in this Congress would
result in more waterbodies being impaired by contamination, such as
harmful algal blooms, not less.
Now is not the time to pull back on federal investments in our
wastewater infrastructure.
Now is not the time to weaken federal and state efforts to protect
our nation's waters.
Now is not the time to weaken our clean water future.
I welcome our panelists here today and look forward to their valued
input.
I yield back the balance of my time.

Maps, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Grace F. Napolitano

Mrs. Napolitano. And I would like to have unanimous consent
that a letter from the National Wildlife Federation, dated May
16, 2023, be included today as part of the hearing record.
Mr. Rouzer. Without objection.
[The information follows:]

Letter of May 16, 2023, to Hon. David Rouzer, Chairman, and Hon. Grace
F. Napolitano, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Resources and
Environment, from Jim Murphy, Director, Legal Advocacy, National
Wildlife Federation, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Grace F.
Napolitano
May 16, 2023.
The Honorable David Rouzer,
Chair,
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Subcommittee on
Water Resources and Environment, 2165 Rayburn House Office
Building, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Grace F. Napolitano,
Ranking Member,
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Subcommittee on
Water Resources and Environment, 2164 Rayburn House Office
Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano,
On behalf of the National Wildlife Federation and our nearly seven
million members and supporters, we urge you to reject attempts to
undermine critical Clean Water Act tools that protect our nation's
waters and wildlife habitat as well as ensure continued access to
cultural resources, traditions, and outdoor recreation.
The National Wildlife Federation is the nation's largest
conservation education and advocacy organization with a long history of
interest and involvement in the management and protection of the
nation's rich array of water resources. We have championed clean and
healthy rivers and streams since our founding in 1936. Conserving our
nation's wetlands, streams, and rivers for fish, wildlife, and
communities is at the core of our mission. We worked closely with
Senator Muskie to pass the Clean Water Act in 1972 and have worked hard
to fulfill its promise of clean water for all Americans ever since.
Clean Water Act Overview
The bipartisan Clean Water Act was signed into law to address the
dire water quality crisis facing our country. The Clean Water Act aims
to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution and destruction of our
waters in order to ``restore and maintain the chemical, physical and
biological integrity of the Nation's waters,'' with a goal to make all
waters in the United States ``swimmable and fishable'' by 1983. While
this goal has yet to be achieved, the law has improved the health of
many waters nationwide and prevented deterioration in many more.\1\ As
a result, the number of waters that meet clean water goals has doubled
since the passage of the Clean Water Act.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strong Measures to Protect Clean Water are Still Needed and Enjoy Broad
Support
Today however, the majority of our waterways are considered
``impaired'' and still don't meet standards safe enough for activities
like fishing and swimming.\2\ Poll after poll shows that the public
overwhelmingly wants the clean, fishable, and swimmable waters promised
by the Clean Water Act. A recent survey found that the vast majority of
Americans strongly support Clean Water Act protections, with 75% of
Americans in favor of protecting more waters and wetlands
nationwide.\3\ At a time when aging water infrastructure and changing
precipitation patterns as a result of climate change threatens to
worsen water quality challenges, Congress should heed the public and
protect Clean Water Act regulatory safeguards, not weaken them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similarly, Congress should invest in important programs authorized
by the Clean Water Act to help communities address water quality
challenges, by upgrading wastewater and stormwater infrastructure and
constructing water quality improvement projects. When outdated sewer
systems dump raw sewage and polluted runoff into local waters or human
and industrial waste bubbles back up directly into homes and streets,
it is often communities of color and low-income communities that are
disproportionately impacted by health and environmental burdens.
Communities that depend on fishing for sustenance and for cultural
practices, are particularly at risk from impaired water quality. While
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 provided historic
funding to help communities address wastewater and stormwater
infrastructure challenges, prevent raw sewage from spilling into local
waters, and improve water quality, Congress must build on these
investments and ensure the Clean Water Act continues to protect water
quality across the country.
Healthy Waters Protect Communities, Wildlife, and Economies
For many states, the health of the economy and state residents is
directly linked to the health of the state's natural resources. To
protect the health and welfare of state residents, economic
productivity must be fostered while also protecting water supplies and
waterways crucial to the health and welfare of all citizens, as well as
to businesses that depend on clean water. Agriculture, commercial
fisheries, outdoor recreation, and tourism, and manufacturing--all
depend upon abundant clean water. Small streams and wetlands that have
long been protected under the Clean Water Act provide clean water for
farmers, keep the economy afloat, protect communities from floods, and
serve as natural features to promote drought resilience. Wetlands help
absorb floodwaters; one single acre of wetland can store 1 to 1.5
million gallons of floodwaters.\4\ Nationwide, the craft brewing
industry, notably dependent on clean water supplies, contributed $76.3
billion to the U.S. economy in 2021, more than 490,000 jobs.\5\ The
fish and wildlife that sustain our outdoor passions and support the
nation's $867 billion outdoor recreation economy rely on these small
streams and wetlands as well.\6\ In some rural, mountain communities,
river recreation and related activities generate the largest share of
the local economy. Ephemeral and tributary streams serve as important
spawning grounds as well as nursery habitat for juvenile fish, such as
salmon and trout. Roughly half of North American waterfowl hatch in the
Prairie Pothole Region and more than a third of North American bird
species rely on wetlands for food, shelter, breeding, nesting, and
rearing their young.

Events in recent years demonstrate how increased pollution in and
degradation of these streams, rivers, and wetlands can have devastating
impacts on public health, drinking water supplies, local economies, and
fish and wildlife habitat across the country. In 2014, a harmful algal
bloom in Lake Erie resulted in a three-day shutdown of Toledo, Ohio's
drinking water supply. In South Florida, recurring toxic algae and red
tide outbreaks have decimated local economies and aquatic wildlife; an
estimated 4.4 million pounds of dead marine life were removed from Lee
County beaches between June-September 2018. Floods along the
Mississippi and Missouri River watersheds, and in communities such as
Houston, Texas which was hit by Hurricane Harvey in 2017, demonstrate
how the destruction of critical floodplain wetlands can exacerbate the
severity and duration of flood events and increase the financial
impacts to local communities, homeowners, farmers, economies, and
businesses.
The Clean Water Act's Framework of Cooperative Federalism Should Remain
Strong
The Clean Water Act established vital tools for ensuring continued
progress towards the fundamental objective of fishable, swimmable
waters. The law's regulatory framework is founded on strong federal-
state partnerships (cooperative federalism) and safeguards that apply
to protect waters. This framework allows states to avoid having to
impose costly, disproportionate, and economically harmful limits on
instate pollution sources to waters within their borders, in order to
offset upstream discharges that would otherwise go unregulated if the
upstream waters are deemed to fall outside the Act's coverage and are
not adequately controlled by upstream states.
Central to the Act's structure is the Section 301 prohibition of
discharges of pollutants, including dredged or fill material, from
point sources into waters of the United States without a federal permit
under either Section 402 or 404 of the Act. Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act establishes a permit program to regulate the discharge of
dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including
wetlands, unless the activity is exempt, like certain farming and
forestry activities. These safeguards minimize the harm from some
80,000 activities each year, that include large scale mining
operations, development projects, water resource projects (such as dams
and levees), and transportation projects (such as highways and
airports).\7\ Section 404 is largely administered by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, but implementation can be delegated to the states
or Tribes. Currently, three states--Michigan, New Jersey, and Florida--
administer the Section 404 program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ Army Corps of Engineers. https://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/
Missions/Value-to-the-Nation/Regulatory/Regulatory-Permits/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 404(c) ensures effective oversight of the Clean Water Act
404 program and serves as an action of last resort to stop the most
unacceptably damaging activities. The US Army Corps of Engineers
approves more than 99% of the 80,000 permit applications it processes
under the 404 program each year, approving millions of permitted
activities. Section 404(c), grants the EPA the authority to restrict,
prohibit, deny, or withdraw the use of an area as a disposal site for
dredged or fill material if the discharge will have unacceptable
adverse effects on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery
areas, wildlife, or recreational areas. During the entire 50-year
history of the Clean Water Act, EPA has only used Section 404(c) as a
last resort for 14 projects, with the vast majority issued by
Republican administrations. EPA's use of its veto authority remains
extremely limited and wholly within the bounds of the statutory
language that has been in place since the Clean Water Act was enacted
with overwhelming bipartisan support. EPA has used its veto authority
in the below 14 instances to protect aquatic resources, wildlife, and
communities:

Pebble Deposit Area, AK. In 2023, the Biden
Administration used Section 404(c) to protect 2,108 acres of wetlands
and 99.7 miles of streams in the Bristol Bay watershed in Alaska that
provide unparalleled, globally significant, ecological and cultural
values. The Bristol Bay watershed provides intact, connected habitats--
from headwaters to ocean--that support abundant, genetically diverse
wild Pacific salmon populations, which in turn help to maintain the
productivity of the entire ecosystem, including numerous other fish and
wildlife species.

Spruce No. 1 Surface Mine, WV. In 2011, the Obama
Administration used Section 404(c) to protect 6.6 miles of some of the
last remaining high quality headwater stream and riparian habitat in
Appalachia. These streams provide critical hydrologic and biological
functions and important habitat for many wildlife species (the project
would also disturb 2,278 acres of vital habitat).

Yazoo Backwater Area Pumps Project, MS. In 2008, the Bush
Administration used Section 404(c) to protect more than 67,000 acres of
some of the richest wetlands in the country. Located in the heart of
the Mississippi River flyway, these hemispherically significant
wetlands are used by 29 million migrating birds each year. This action
also saved federal taxpayers well over $220 million.

Two Forks Reservoir, VA. In 1990, the first Bush
Administration used Section 404(c) to protect 300 acres of wetlands and
30 miles of the South Platte River, including 14 miles designated by
the State of Colorado as a ``gold medal'' trout stream, 281 acres of
riffle and pool complexes, and the Cheesman Canyon wilderness area.

Big River Reservoir, RI. In 1990, the first Bush
Administration used Section 404(c) to protect 575 acres of exceptional
and diverse natural wetlands with habitat for an assemblage of wildlife
species.

Ware Creek Reservoir, VA. In 1989, the first Bush
Administration used Section 404(c) to protect a 425 acres mosaic of
high quality aquatic resources in the Chesapeake Bay watershed,
including critical fish nurseries.

Lake Alma, GA. In 1988, the Reagan Administration used
Section 404(c) to protect 1,155 acres of bottomland hardwood wetlands
providing important habitat for an assemblage of species.

Henry Rem Estates, FL. In 1988, the Reagan Administration
used Section 404(c) to protect 432 acres of Everglades wetlands
providing significant fish and wildlife habitat including potential
Florida panther habitat.

Russo Development Corp., NJ. In 1988, the Reagan
Administration used Section 404(c) to protect 58 acres of wetlands
within the Atlantic Flyway used by a multitude of State threatened and
endangered species.

Attleboro Mall (Sweeden's Swamp), MA. In 1986, the Reagan
Administration used Section 404(c) to protect 45 acres of New England
red maple forested swamp, including high-quality habitat for a variety
of wildlife.

Bayou aux Carpes, LA. In 1985, the Reagan Administration
used Section 404(c) to protect 3,000 acres of essential wetlands
including habitat for osprey and American alligator.

Maybank Site, Jehossee Island, SC. In 1985, the Reagan
Administration used Section 404(c) to protect 900 acres of coastal
intertidal marsh including valuable spawning and nursery grounds for
blue crab and shrimp.

M.A. Norden Co., Inc., AL. In 1984, the Reagan
Administration used Section 404(c) to protect 25 acres of forested and
emergent wetland--one of the last remaining wetlands in the Mobile
area.

North Miami Landfill, FL. In 1981, the Carter
Administration used Section 404(c) to protect 103 acres of wetlands and
other aquatic resources including essential nursery grounds for marine
fish and invertebrates.

Clean Water Act Section 402 established the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Program, which requires a permit
for discharges of point source pollution into our waters. Permits
contain discharge limits, monitoring and reporting requirements, and
other provisions to ensure that discharges aren't polluting the water
in question in a way that impacts its ability to provide drinking
water, or serve purposes like fishing and recreating. Importantly,
NPDES permits issued to state and municipal dischargers have permit
limits of five years, which allows the implementation of needed
infrastructure upgrades while also providing a way to ensure that
pollution controls remain effective as conditions change. When NPDES
permits are issued or renewed, it allows the public to weigh in on the
conditions and limitations applying to pollution dischargers. This five
year permit term limit ensures that discharge limits are adjusted
regularly to account for updated water quality and pollution control
standards that are reflective of the best science and technology
available. Currently, 47 states implement their own EPA-approved point
source discharge permit programs, demonstrating the Clean Water Act's
cooperative federalism framework.
Clean Water Act Section 401 is a cornerstone of the federal
structure envisioned by the Clean Water Act, providing a regulatory
framework for states and tribes to work cooperatively with the federal
government to ensure that their aquatic resources are protected from
potential impacts related to federally issued permits and licenses.
This allows states and Tribes to protect the water quality of
waterbodies that communities and wildlife rely on for drinking water,
recreation, cultural practices, and habitat. This program has been
instrumental in ensuring that federally licensed and permitted
projects, such as dams, pipelines, and transportation projects, proceed
in a manner that protects important waters uses that communities and
wildlife rely on such as safe drinking water, adequate flow, fish
passage, and recreational access. The vast majority of certifications
are processed quickly and often allow projects to move forward with
protective conditions. It is critical that states and tribes retain
broad authority to review and impose protective conditions on projects
that may impact their water quality--not just the point-source
discharge itself but the project ``activity as a whole,'' pursuant to
Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.
The Army Corps of Engineers plays an important role in Clean Water
Act enforcement and implementation as well. As stated above, the Corps
of Engineers reports that it typically issues about 80,000 permit
decisions and 50,000 jurisdictional determinations each year.\8\ ``More
than 97% of the Corps' regulatory workload is processed in the form of
general permits.'' \9\ While recent data on the number of permits
denied is not readily available, in 2010 the Corps denied just 0.4
percent of permits requested (275 were denied out of a total of 68,000
permit decisions). Permit reviews could be expedited by increasing
appropriations to the Corps' regulatory program. Over the past 20
years, the Corps' regulatory program budget has been declining in real
dollars when adjusted for inflation, despite the Corps' significant
regulatory work load.

The National Wildlife Federation urges Congress to reject any
attempts to undermine critical Clean Water Act tools that protect our
nation's waters, communities, and wildlife habitat as well as ensure
continued access to cultural resources, traditions, and outdoor

years and ensure that all communities, including Tribal nations,
benefit from the protections of the Clean Water Act.

Mrs. Napolitano. I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentlelady yields.
I now recognize the ranking member of the full committee,
Mr. Larsen, for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
So, my State is defined by its clean water, from the Puget
Sound to the hundreds of lakes and thousands of miles of rivers
and streams throughout Washington. Washingtonians know that
protecting these rivers, streams, and wetlands takes work and
attention, and that the health of one body of water is
intrinsically connected to the health of another.
Our waters and water-related economy depend upon the
protections of the Clean Water Act and its pollution prevention
programs. It is more effective and less costly to prevent
pollution than to clean up pollution. That is true in my State.
It is true in every State and Territory.
The Puget Sound has several programs and authorities
dedicated to its recovery, but even with these investments,
progress remains slow. Improved water quality is a foundation
of recovery and is essential to other goals like habitat
restoration, increasing species population, and improving the
resiliency of the Sound.
So, when this committee passed the Clean Water Act over 50
years ago, Members recognized the effectiveness and importance
of comprehensive pollution prevention measures rather than
simply investing in pollution cleanups. In passing the CWA,
Congress specifically noted that the State-by-State, go-it-
alone approach was, quote, ``inadequate in every vital
aspect,'' end quote, and left waters severely polluted and
expensive to restore.
So, for decades, Republicans and Democrats shared these
bipartisan principles to achieve clean water: Maintain a strong
Federal-State partnership to protect our waters, stop pollution
from entering the system in the first place, and support a
robust Federal floor of protections while allowing States to do
more but not less.
Last Congress, we passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
affirming our commitment to improving our infrastructure. The
BIL included significant investment in our water
infrastructure, providing $13.8 billion in Federal dollars for
upgrading our wastewater systems, preventing pollution
discharges, and supporting restoration programs in places like
the Puget Sound, but many other places as well.
These investments are critical, providing a lifeline to
communities across the country struggling to maintain water
quality. Members who voted for the BIL voted for clean water.
Such a large Federal investment requires careful oversight
to ensure that congressional intent is met. On that, we have
agreement.
Communities are best served if agencies get the programs
set up and get those funds out the door quickly. On that, we
also have agreement.
Where we diverge, however, is using these investments
sometimes as an excuse to weaken the Clean Water Act under the
guise of expediting projects. We will hear testimony today
about how project delivery reforms that may sound good can have
an adverse impact on water quality.
Clean Water Act investments have led to significant
progress in restoring the chemical, physical, and biological
integrity of our waters. Still, a lot of work remains to be
done. EPA data indicates that the percentage of impaired waters
is back on the rise.
Impaired waters are those that do not meet water quality
standards, and today, a leading cause of impairment is excess
nutrients. I think almost everyone on this committee has water
bodies in their district that are threatened by harmful algal
blooms and other algal growth fueled by excessive nutrients.
As we saw on the map from NOAA, there are harmful algal
bloom outbreaks across the country: Florida, the Chesapeake
Bay, the Great Lakes, and, of course, in the Pacific Northwest.
We all have significant outbreaks. Virtually no region is
untouched.
So, I can't support weakening clean water protections and
increasing the chance of excess nutrients and pollution
entering water systems. So, I urge my colleagues representing
affected regions on this map to think through what weaker
protections means for constituents.
This is just one example of a growing water quality
problem. Removing or weakening protections now will cost more
in the future, even without other factors making the situation
worse.
Yet we know that climate change threatens our water supply,
water quality, and water ecosystems--so, other factors will
come into play.
Now is not the time to retreat on the goals and intent of
the Clean Water Act. I encourage ideas to get the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law funding to our communities faster, but ideas
that put polluters over people and saddle the public with the
cost of cleanup are not sustainable.
I thank the witnesses for joining us today, and I look
forward to your testimony.
With that, I yield back.

are three lights in front of you. Green, obviously, is go;
yellow means your time is running short; and then, of course,
red means that it is time to wrap it up just as quickly as you
can.
I ask unanimous consent that the witnesses' full statements
be included in the record.
Without objection, so ordered.
As your written testimony has been made part of the record,
the subcommittee asks that you limit your oral remarks to 5
minutes.
With that, Dr. Travnicek, you are recognized for your 5
minutes.

TESTIMONY OF ANDREA J. TRAVNICEK, Ph.D., DIRECTOR, NORTH DAKOTA
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

Ms. Travnicek. Good morning, Chairman Rouzer, Ranking
Member Napolitano, and members of the subcommittee. Thank you
for the invitation to testify today on the impact of the Clean
Water Act on infrastructure project completion.
My name is Andrea Travnicek, and I am the director of the
North Dakota Department of Water Resources. The Department is
charged with managing the use of the State's waters.
In managing North Dakota's waters, the Department works
closely with other State agencies. We understand North Dakota's
unique hydrological landscape. North Dakota has over 1 million
wetlands covering approximately 6 percent of the entire State.
Many of these wetlands are in North Dakota's prairie pothole
region and may be isolated and temporary. North Dakota
diligently protects these wetlands and all its waters, both
surface and subsurface, while at the same time encouraging
appropriate economic development for beneficial use by
agriculture, oil and gas, and other industries. We take these
management responsibilities very seriously, and strongly
believe that North Dakota's waters are better protected and
more effectively managed by North Dakota agencies than by
Federal agencies headquartered in Washington, DC.
Over the past decade, North Dakota has vigorously resisted
Federal intrusion into the management of its State's waters,
including the EPA's and Corps latest rule defining ``waters of
the United States,'' or WOTUS, for purposes of the Clean Water
Act. Currently, North Dakota and 23 other States are
challenging the rule in a lawsuit brought in North Dakota
Federal District Court. Recognizing the rule's harmful impacts,
Judge Hovland issued a preliminary injunction order that
prohibits application of the rule in the plaintiff States. As a
result, the pre-2015 regulatory regime remains in place in
North Dakota.
If the new WOTUS rule went into effect in North Dakota, the
Department would be directly impacted because it manages
numerous large water infrastructure projects and assists with
flood control and water supply projects throughout the State.
With these projects, the Department is often in the position of
applying for dredge and fill permits from the Corps under
section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Under the rule, the
Department would be forced to undertake an expensive
jurisdictional analysis for these projects to determine if they
impact WOTUS under the expanded definition and are thus subject
to section 404 permitting requirements.
For example, the Northwest Area Water Supply, or NAWS,
which is owned by the State of North Dakota, intends to bring
water to 81,000 North Dakota citizens in the north central
prairie pothole region of our State with a greatly improved
water supply, both in terms of quality and quantity. Many
cities and rural areas in the NAWS project area have domestic
water supplies that do not meet minimum drinking water
standards. The benefits of NAWS include not only a clean and
abundant supply of water for the residents in North Dakota, but
more opportunities for potential industries and a stronger
economy. To date, Federal, State, and local partners have
already invested over $350 million into NAWS projects, with an
additional $85 million in water investments planned. The risk
of NAWS infrastructure being potentially adversely impacted by
this rule is unthinkable and could have tremendous human health
and economic impacts to the State.
Intrusive Federal regulation may have unintended
consequences that are harmful to the environment. The new WOTUS
rule would also result in additional costly evaluations to
determine section 404 permitting requirements for other
underground pipelines being built in the State as well.
Pipelines may need to be rerouted with excessive reengineering
costs, permitting delays, or perhaps canceled altogether. This
could impact pipelines needed to transport natural gas to
reduce flaring and meet the State's target of reaching 98 to
100 percent gas capture and zero percent routine flaring by
2030. To meet this target of eliminating flaring, the gas
gathering and processing industry needs to construct thousands
of miles of natural gas pipelines per year for the next 10 to
15 years. The rule would also impact the ability to construct
the thousands of miles of pipelines needed to transport carbon
dioxide to meet national carbon capture and storage goals.
Even without the new rule, section 404 permitting
requirements cause harmful delays that could lead to cost
increases, especially in North Dakota's prairie pothole region,
where it is often subjective as to whether WOTUS will be
impacted. Section 404 permitting delays are also especially
harmful in North Dakota, due to our short construction season.
A loss of one construction season carries through the entire
infrastructure program, resulting in cumulative increased
trucking and the associated environmental impacts to air
quality, as well as increases in costs.
In addition to rescinding the new WOTUS rule, one solution
to ease overly stringent Federal permitting requirements would
be to adopt State-specific regional conditions for the Corps'
Nationwide Permit 12, which applies to oil and gas pipelines;
and Nationwide Permit 58, which applies to any linear utility
line. State regional conditions should be adopted into these
nationwide permits to address Federal and State environmental
concerns as we proposed to the Corps as recently as October
2020. Another area for improvement would be to have more
consistent application of section 404 permitting requirements
by Corps staff and to address staffing issues at the agency
that exacerbate permitting delays.
North Dakota has a significant interest both in the proper
management and protection of its State waters and in improving
its infrastructure to support public health, safety, and the
economy. We appreciate the partnership of the Federal agencies
in achieving these goals, but our Federal partners must respect
States' rights. The EPA and the Corps should work with States
to reduce uncertainties and inconsistencies in section 404
permitting and other Clean Water Act programs to improve the
ability of States to timely complete important infrastructure
projects.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentlelady.

TESTIMONY OF HON. SERENA COLEMAN McILWAIN, SECRETARY, MARYLAND
DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT

Ms. McIlwain. Thank you. Can you hear me?
Good morning, Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano,
Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and the members of the
subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me here today to testify
on the importance of the Federal Clean Water Act----
Mr. Rouzer [interrupting]. If you can bring that microphone
just a little closer to you.
Ms. McIlwain. How about now? Is this better? All right.
[Continuing] To the Nation's health, economy, and overall
quality of life.
Just over 50 years ago, Congress passed the Clean Water
Act, and I want to start by reflecting on the history that led
to the passage. In the late 1960s, rivers were literally
catching on fire from oil and industrial pollution discharges.
A 1969 Time magazine article published dramatic photos of fires
on the Cuyahoga River in Ohio and described a river that
``oozes rather than flows.'' And I am attaching one of those
photos for the record, and you can see that here.
At the same time, Rachel Carson's famous book, ``Silent
Spring,'' revealed the hazards of pesticides and a historic oil
well blowout off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, which
galvanized the public and Congress to take action to protect
our waters. As a result, President Nixon created the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, and Congress passed
the Clean Water Act in 1972.
One of the central goals of the Clean Water Act is to
ensure that the Nation's waters are fishable and swimmable, and
that means that our waters are safe for our children to swim in
and that we can safely consume fish and seafood from our waters
without fear of getting cancer or being exposed to toxic
substances. The Clean Water Act also helps to protect drinking
water sources from contamination.
The Clean Water Act does this by establishing designated
uses, for example, as a public water supply, for the Nation's
regulated waters, setting science-based criteria and standards
that will meet those uses, and by ensuring that waters meeting
their uses are not degraded by pollution. The act also allows
for standards to be set using either water quality or best
available technology standards.
And while we have made progress over the years--our waters
are no longer catching on fire--there is still so much work to
do to ensure all the Nation's waters are fishable and
swimmable. At the same time, we have emerging contaminants to
deal with, like PFAS, and they are contaminating our drinking
water and fisheries.
In fact, according to EPA's own data, only 30 percent of
our rivers and streams are healthy, 40 percent of our Nation's
lakes have excess nutrients that help fuel algae blooms, only
71 percent of our estuaries and 31 percent of our Great Lakes
and near-shore environments have healthy aquatic communities,
and only 48 percent of our national wetlands have healthy
biology.
If we were giving ourselves a report card, four out of five
of those statistics represents we are failing. I come from
Maryland. The amazing Chesapeake Bay and its watershed run
through the heart of our State. And the Chesapeake Bay and its
tributaries do not just belong to Marylanders. These waters are
a part of our national identity and heritage.
The overall health of the Chesapeake Bay and its
tributaries has dramatically improved as a result of mandates
under the Clean Water Act; from leadership by Maryland's
government over the past 50 years; significant Federal, State,
and local investments; and the commitments and actions by local
governments. A healthy bay is vital to protect vulnerable
people from climate change, strengthen our shorelines to buffer
against waves and storm surges, and support healthy ecosystems
and fisheries, such as our rockfish, oyster, and crab
population.
Since 1985, Maryland has reduced its nitrogen pollution by
about 40 percent, or about 35 million pounds per year. Data
collected confirms that water quality in Maryland is trending
in the right direction. One of our largest reductions in
pollution comes from wastewater treatment plants, which are
regulated under State and Federal Clean Water Act permits. A
total of 67 of the largest, and many of the smaller, facilities
that treat sewage in Maryland are now operating using cutting-
edge technology. The water is cleaner and able to be reused.
These environmental successes put Maryland in a national and
international leadership position. That all began with the
Clean Water Act.
Additionally, more than 90 percent of urban runoff in
Maryland falls under the protection of the Clean Water Act.
This means by better managing stormwater runoff, we are making
our communities more spongy, soaking in rain, and so, more
resilient to storm events, and reducing pollution and flooding.
In the next 5 years, new permits will add another 11,000
acres to the 35,000 impervious acres restored under prior
permits. The restoration is larger than the area of Washington,
DC, and results from bipartisan environmental leadership
spanning multiple administrations. These permits drive climate
resiliency, green infrastructure, and advance innovations such
as pay-for-success contracting, public-private partnerships,
and new technologies.

and results from bipartisan environmental leadership spanning multiple

infrastructure, and advance innovations such as pay-for-success
contracting, public-private partnerships, and new technologies.
The Water Quality State Revolving Fund, a fund resulting from the
Clean Water Act, which is capitalized by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, annually provides about $3.3 billion in funding for
clean water improvements in Maryland since its inception. The
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is providing even more funding to the
state revolving funds, enabling Maryland to fund additional projects as
we approach the 2025 Bay Total Maximum Daily Load deadline. In
particular, the Infrastructure Law is enabling Maryland to provide
historic levels of loan forgiveness to disadvantaged communities.
Yet with all the progress and investment, we are still striving to
fully achieve our fishable and swimmable goals. In fact, we are
currently taking public comments on a settlement agreement resulting
from Maryland, other Bay jurisdictions, and NGOs working to enforce
proper oversight and accountability in restoring the Bay.
When I think of the next 50 years for the Clean Water Act, it is
clear we in fact need to work harder to ensure greater accountability,
be more resolute with compliance and enforcement, and recommit to
oversight for healthy communities, ecosystems, and to realize the full
economic prosperity that comes with clean and safe water.
Clean water is good for our health and good for the economy. This
is not a binary choice, where we either have clean water or economic
growth. Rather, we can only have economic growth if we have clean
water. An EPA study indicated that clean water can increase the
property value of nearby homes by up to 25 percent. Other studies
indicate a $1 investment in water and sewer infrastructure yields $6.35
in gross domestic product output.
The Chesapeake Bay alone supports almost 34,000 jobs in local
economies. This includes watermen, commercial trade, tourism, and
recreation. Each year, the commercial seafood industry in Maryland
contributes nearly $600 million to our economy. And the dockside value
of the blue crab harvest in Maryland was $33 million in 2020.
All the jurisdictions represented on this subcommittee are
downstream from another jurisdiction, and when upstream jurisdictions
are not protecting clean water, it not only affects our health but also
property values downstream. Imagine how much more prosperous we would
be if Chesapeake Bay and the nation were meeting their clean water
goals? Government has a key role in this. The private sector does, too,
to keep water clean and not pass on the costs of pollution to
downstream communities.
I want to close by thanking members of this Subcommittee for
supporting the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the historic
investments in clean water that this law provides. These investments
represent a down payment on a prosperous clean water future, and we
still need to do more. All of our citizens not only deserve, but
require, clean and abundant water for their communities to survive. Now
is not the time to let up when we are still falling so short of our
goals.
Thank you again for this opportunity, and I look forward to the
discussion.

Mr. Conway.

TESTIMONY OF MICKEY CONWAY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, METRO
WATER RECOVERY, DENVER, COLORADO, ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION OF CLEAN WATER AGENCIES

Mr. Conway. Good morning. Thank you, Chairman Graves and
Rouzer, Ranking Members Larsen and Napolitano, and all the
members of the subcommittee, for the opportunity to testify
today. I am here on behalf of the National Association of Clean
Water Agencies, or NACWA, to talk about potential improvements
to the Clean Water Act.
My name is Mickey Conway. I am the CEO of Metro Water
Recovery. We are a clean water treatment and resource recovery
facility in Denver, Colorado, serving 2.2 million people. It is
about 40 percent of Colorado's population. And I am also
privileged to serve on NACWA's board of directors, and honored
to represent its over 350 public clean water utility members
that, like Metro, are anchor institutions in protecting public
health and the environment. This is what we do every day, and
we are proud to be here to talk about that.
Clean water utilities today face unprecedented challenges,
including aging infrastructure, climate resiliency issues,
managing nutrients and emerging contaminants such as PFAS, and
those are things that our folks dive into with vigor every day.
But additionally and just as important to managing those
issues is managing them in a way that keeps our ratepayers in a
place that they can pay their bills. Many of the folks in our
service areas are having trouble paying their rent, they are
having trouble paying their grocery bills, and much less their
utility bills. And all of our investments have to make sense
for them and actually improve water quality. And that really
especially pertains to those in small rural and economically
disadvantaged communities.
So, with all that in mind, there are three key Clean Water
Act improvements I would like to discuss briefly that will, I
think, provide, one, regulatory certainty and, two, making sure
dollars are going towards clean water and not towards
litigation or changing course and really affecting our
ratepayers disproportionately.
These all involve our NPDES permit. So, members like NACWA
members operate pursuant to permits issued by the National
Pollution Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES. And these
permits basically tell us what we can put into the waters. They
also guide us in our infrastructure projects to make sure we
can meet the permits.
And these projects, as you can imagine, are incredibly
complex. They are very long in term. And changing the rules in
the middle of the project is like turning the Titanic around.
You just can't do it. And so, for us, in order to be able to
deliver clean water at a reasonable price, we have got to be
able to rely on permit terms and rely on the permit system
throughout the term of the permit.
I guarantee that any public servant in front of you will
tell you that you better have a plan before you dig up city
streets and spend billions of dollars in infrastructure, and
that permit is our plan.
So, Clean Water Act section 402 has a permit shield
provision, which is expressed in EPA policy at this point. And
the permit shield is essentially laid out like this: If the
permittee provides all the necessary information to the permit
writer, the permit writer incorporates that information and
includes the necessary limits in the permit. And then at that
point, the permittee can rely on that permit. Whether or not
pollutants are expressly laid out in the permit or not,
whatever is discharged is considered lawful.
The United States Supreme Court expressed that that was
all--the entire permit policy is really to express finality of
the permit, and that is what utilities can rely on. That
finality is being challenged now in a number of litigations,
and the methodology of challenging the scope of the permit
shield is that we are going after pollutants that are not
expressly laid out in a NPDES permit.
The problem with that--an example is PFAS--is PFAS is not
in wastewater permits at this point and will not be for many
years. If people can sue utilities over discharging PFAS, which
we as wastewater utilities passively receive, the money that
our folks who are having a hard time paying bills for is going
to go to litigation and it is not going to go to cleaning up
the water. We are working very hard to manage PFAS, but we
can't also fend off lawsuits for something we can't control or
we are not permitted for.
The second scope of 402(k) that we are looking to get
improvements on is language in the permits themselves that is
ambiguous and invites litigation. There are boilerplate
languages added to certain permits that say dischargers shall
not ``cause or contribute to the violation of water quality
standards.'' I have been in this business for over a quarter
century. I have no idea what that means.
I need to have limits that I can hit with constituents that
I can hit and not language that invites litigation and, again,
transfers money from my ratepayers into lawyers' pockets. And I
am a former practicing lawyer, so, I will say that I think
there are plenty of opportunities for attorneys to make money
elsewhere.
Finally, I think we would like to just note that the
objectives of the Clean Water Act would be better served if
water quality standards are done in a more transparent way. We
would ask that EPA undergo notice and comment rulemaking when
developing standards and provide for limited judicial review.
That allows communities to reflect and participate in the
process and talk about what meaningful standards will be,
especially since the burden of cost falls on those communities
to take care of that.
So, I think these three potential improvements would help
with regulatory certainty and, again, putting the money where
it needs to go in the Clean Water Act towards clean water
projects.
Thank you for your time.
[Mr. Conway's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Mickey Conway, Chief Executive Officer, Metro
Water Recovery, Denver, Colorado, on behalf of the National Association
of Clean Water Agencies
Good morning and thank you Chairmen Graves and Rouzer, Ranking
Members Larsen and Napolitano, and all members of the Subcommittee for
the invitation to testify before you today on behalf of the National
Association of Clean Water Agencies, or NACWA, on the need for critical
reforms as we look to the next fifty years of the Clean Water Act.
My name is Mickey Conway, and I am the Chief Executive Officer of
Metro Water Recovery. Metro is the largest resource recovery and clean
water provider in the Rocky Mountain West, serving more than 2.2
million people throughout the Denver-Metro region. We work with 61
local governments, including cities, counties, and water and sanitation
districts across our 805-square mile service area to provide clean
water services, generate renewable energy, and promote sustainable
agriculture.
I also serve on NACWA's Board of Directors and NACWA's Executive
Committee, and I am honored to be here today to represent NACWA and its
over 350 public clean water utility members that, like Metro, are
anchor institutions protecting public health and the environment in the
communities they serve nationwide.
Clean water utilities today face an unprecedented number of
challenges. Replacing aging infrastructure, increasing system
resiliency in the face of climate change, addressing emerging
contaminants including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS,
developing and maintaining a strong workforce, and protecting against
increasing threats to cyber-security are just a few of the critical
issues utilities must manage every day.
And while tackling these challenges is of vital importance to the
long-term health and vitality of the communities we serve, it is every
bit as pressing that we do so in a way that keeps rates affordable for
everyone. NACWA members are stewards not only of the environment, but
also of public funds; we must plan for the future while not
overburdening our ratepayers today, particularly those in small, rural,
and disadvantaged communities.
It is for these reasons that I am testifying before the Committee
this morning. There are three key Clean Water Act reforms in particular
I will discuss that could help alleviate some of the burdens utilities
face by providing the regulatory certainty necessary for long-term
strategic planning while also stemming the unnecessary flow of
increasingly scarce public dollars to costly and unwarranted
litigation.
Public clean water agencies are proud of the water quality
advancements they have made in the first 50 years of the Clean Water
Act's implementation. If adopted, these reforms would give utilities
the ability to do even more by helping to ensure that, over the next 50
years, the Clean Water Act continues to protect those we are tasked to
protect--our local community residents.
Metro--like all NACWA members--operates pursuant to Clean Water Act
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES, permits.
These permits outline the requirements the discharges from our
facilities must meet to ensure the protection of water quality. They
are not only a critical tool in protecting the environment, but they
allow utilities to plan and make the infrastructure investments
necessary to meet the permit terms and, thereby, provide the greatest
benefit to local communities.
Due to the volume of wastewater and stormwater public clean water
agencies manage and treat, infrastructure improvements needed to meet
increasingly stringent Clean Water Act requirements often entail long-
term financial and technical planning, as well as large-scale--and
frequently disruptive--construction projects. It is therefore critical
that requirements in utility NPDES permits be developed transparently,
that a utility's Clean Water Act obligations be clearly outlined in
those permits, and that a utility be able to rely on those permits for
the entire length of their term. I guarantee you that any public
servant in front of the Committee would say the same thing--you better
have a solid plan in place before you start digging up city streets.
Clean Water Act Section 402(k)--the NPDES ``permit shield''
provision--provides key protections to clean water utilities in this
regard. Under that provision, Congress deemed compliance with an NPDES
permit to be compliance with the Clean Water Act itself.
Pursuant to EPA's longstanding ``permit shield'' policy
interpreting Section 402(k), if a permittee provides all the
information it is supposed to during the permit application process, it
is the NPDES permit writer's job to include all the limits necessary to
meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act in the permit. If a permit
holder complies with those limits, all of the pollutants discharged
from the facility that were within the reasonable contemplation of the
permit writer--regardless of whether or not they are expressly
identified or limited in the permit--are considered lawfully permitted
discharges for purposes of Clean Water Act compliance.
Importantly, before an NPDES permit is finalized, EPA can object to
it if it does not include any necessary limits. Likewise, environmental
organizations and citizens can bring lawsuits against permits they do
not think are stringent enough within a specified statutory timeframe.
But once a permit is ``final,'' under the Section 402(k) ``permit
shield,'' a permit holder can rely on it as the touchstone for Clean
Water Act compliance during its term.
The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the purpose of the ``permit
shield'' is to ``insulate permit holders from changes in various
regulations during the period of a permit and to relieve permit holders
of having to litigate the question of whether their permits are
sufficiently strict. In short, Section 402(k) serves the purpose of
giving permits finality.''
But this finality, which is especially important in the context of
restoring and maintaining the nation's critical wastewater and
stormwater infrastructure, is being threatened in two fundamental ways.
Firstly, outside parties are increasingly challenging the scope of
the ``permit shield'' as applied to pollutants not expressly listed in
an NPDES permit. This is particularly problematic in the context of
emerging contaminants that EPA has not yet developed permitting
requirements for, such as PFAS. Codification of EPA's ``permit shield''
policy would help protect communities across the country from being
forced to spend precious public dollars defending against such
lawsuits, distracting the utility from meeting the requirements already
contained in the permit as well as from finding solutions to actually
begin the process to address, in this example, PFAS contamination. It
is important to underscore that utility leaders and workers are public
servants and dedicated environmental stewards, and they need certainty
to ensure these goals can be met.
By way of example, one public utility in Georgia is being sued for
allegedly ``unlawfully discharging'' PFAS it passively receives from
upstream carpet manufacturing processes because its NPDES permit does
not include PFAS limits and its treatment facility was (unsurprisingly)
not designed to remove these indestructible manmade chemicals.
Clean water utilities have already begun to work with EPA and state
partners to develop the requirements and treatment processes necessary
to protect our nation's waterbodies from PFAS pollution. The notion
that, in the meantime, thousands of utilities all over the country
could be held to be categorically out of compliance with the Clean
Water Act because such requirements and treatment processes do not yet
exist and have therefore not been written into NPDES permits is
unacceptable.
EPA and state regulators must be permitted to address PFAS through
the Clean Water Act's well-established, science-based effluent
limitations development processes. And utilities, in turn, must not be
faced with the imposition of ad hoc, activist-driven permitting
requirements through litigation.
The second threat to the scope of Section 402(k) is related to the
first. A growing number of suits are being brought over the boilerplate
language often included in NPDES permits stating that discharges shall
not ``cause or contribute to the violation of water quality
standards.'' A statutory requirement that permit writers use only clear
permitting terms, not vague and unclear boilerplate language that
invites uncertainty and litigation, could save communities across the
country from being placed in untenable positions.
As I mentioned earlier, under EPA's own regulations and guidance,
it is a permit writer's job to include all necessary limits in a permit
to ensure that authorized discharges are protective of water quality
standards. But both outside parties and EPA itself are increasingly
trying to enforce this boilerplate language well into a permit's term
as if it were a separate, all-encompassing ``effluent limitation.''
This position eviscerates the ``permit finality'' the Supreme Court
has held an NPDES permit is supposed to provide, as it effectively
allows permit writers to establish post-hoc requirements they failed to
include when they issued the permit at any time under the guise of
``enforcing'' this generic fiat. It likewise provides outside parties
with an avenue to second-guess permitting decisions and read new limits
into a permit well after the statutory timeframe provided for permit
objections.
The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that due process demands that
``regulated parties should know what is required of them.'' Public
clean water agencies are regulated parties that have and continue to
spend billions of dollars to maintain and upgrade our nation's critical
wastewater and stormwater infrastructure. It is especially important
for these utilities to have clear Clean Water Act requirements that
they can strategically plan to meet in the manner that best protects
the health and environment of the communities they operate in. The City
of San Francisco--a NACWA member--is in fact currently engaged in
litigation aimed at forcing EPA to remove this boilerplate language
from one of its NPDES permits considering the unacceptable amounts of
risk and uncertainty it poses. Congress can provide such relief to
utilities nationwide through these reforms, and I strongly encourage it
to do so.
And finally, even if NPDES permits clearly identify a permittee's
obligations and provide permit holders with sufficient regulatory
certainty, the objectives of the Clean Water Act will not be met if the
water quality standards upon which the limits in those permits are
based were not developed in a transparent, science-based process.
Requiring EPA to undergo notice and comment rulemaking when
developing recommended water quality criteria and subjecting the final
criteria to a limited judicial review process under Clean Water Act
Section 509(b) would help ensure that the onus placed on public
agencies are necessary and do not unduly burden communities while
providing little corresponding environmental benefit.
EPA develops recommended water quality criteria which states must
consider adopting under Clean Water Act Section 304(a). While states
can adopt different criteria if approved by EPA most states simply do
not have the resources to do so. The criteria developed by EPA under
Section 304(a) are therefore typically adopted into state water quality
standards and translated into all NPDES permits through enforceable
permit limits.
While it is true that EPA typically takes comment on its proposed
criteria and subjects them to limited review from its Science Advisory
Board, because the Agency takes the position that the criteria are just
``guidance,'' it does not fully follow the regulatory requirements of
the Administrative Procedure Act or the Office of Management and
Budget, including those related to fully considering and responding to
public comments. Nor can impacted parties legally challenge any final
criteria, as EPA does not treat the criteria as ``final agency
action,'' even though, for the majority of NPDES permit holders
nationwide, they will ultimately dictate permitting obligations.
As utilities face complex and costly infrastructure challenges over
the next 50 years, it is critical that the limits imposed in NPDES
permits be based on the best available science and a complete record,
not political whim or expedience. The reforms under consideration could
help ensure this happens.
This concludes my testimony. Thank you for giving me the
opportunity to speak here today. NACWA appreciates the ongoing
engagement by the Committee with the public clean water sector on these
critical issues, and I would be happy to answer any questions the
Committee may have.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Farris, you have 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF BRANDON FARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT, ENERGY AND
RESOURCES POLICY, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS

Mr. Farris. Good morning. Good morning, Chairman Rouzer,
Ranking Member Napolitano, members of the committee. Thank you
for the chance to speak with you on behalf of the 13 million
men and women who make things in America to convey the urgency
of permitting reform.
Streamlining and modernizing our Nation's permitting laws
and procedures will help us advance many of our Nation's shared
priorities, improving the quality of life for all communities,
modernizing our infrastructure, achieving energy security,
ramping up critical mineral protection, enhancing manufacturing
competitiveness, and creating manufacturing jobs in the U.S.
These are goals that all Americans can support.
At a time of economic uncertainty, when every investment in
a new powerplant, a new road, a new manufacturing facility
makes us more globally competitive, why should we settle for a
permitting process that can take 10 or 15 years to approve
essential projects?
One of manufacturers' biggest concerns is that the
permitting process often drags far longer than necessary. For
example, here is something we have heard from one of our
manufacturers of critical raw materials for semiconductors,
clean hydrogen, and lithium-ion batteries. In many cases, these
products cannot be made without their chemicals, but because of
the regulatory uncertainty in obtaining a Clean Water Act
section 402 permit in a timely manner, that company recently
announced that they are going to build a facility in the EU
that manufactures material necessary to produce clean hydrogen.
A White House CEQ report also found that environmental
impact statements mandated under NEPA take, on average, 4\1/2\
years. That means more time is spent projecting potential
environmental impacts than it takes to actually construct and
operate a hydrogen power generation facility.
The impact of leaving our existing permitting processes
untouched is clear. The U.S. will fall behind international
competitors that are taking every step possible to incentivize
manufacturing development. Quality of life, environmental
progress, and economic competitiveness in the U.S. will suffer
as a result.
Permitting reform can be achieved without compromising our
Nation's or our industry's high standards for environmental
protection and sustainability. It is possible to preserve and
uphold these standards with fewer delays and fewer needless
lawsuits.
So, as detailed in my written testimony, manufacturers have
a few priorities. First, we want to see consolidated processes
with enforceable deadlines for the siting of new energy
projects, including hydrogen, natural gas, nuclear, and other
emerging technologies and their infrastructure.
Second, we want to see faster approvals for transportation
infrastructure projects on which we all rely. For instance, it
takes around 7 years to build a new road from our employees'
house to their facility. That is delaying investment. You don't
build new facilities if you don't have roads to be able to
access them.
Third, we want to see a commitment to developing our
resources to strengthen our supply chains for critical minerals
that DoD calls vital to our national defense.
Fourth, we believe that EPA and the other agencies should
refrain from issuing new and shifting regulations before
current standards are implemented.
Finally, Congress should ensure the administration follows
congressional intent on recent and future statutory
streamlining efforts, such as the One Federal Decision.
All of this should be done in a technology-neutral way. Let
consumers, end users, and market conditions determine what
works best. And when there must be judicial review, it should
be meaningful and timely. Manufacturers believe in protecting
our communities--we live there--our neighbors and our
environment.
Permitting reform will help us achieve more: more
manufacturing, more domestic energy production, more inputs and
raw materials, and, most importantly, more jobs. And our
country and the world will be better off if we and our allies
do not depend on authoritarian rivals for energy and other
natural resources.
The manufacturing industry will continue doing what it
always does: innovating, creating jobs, and improving the
quality of life for everyone. But we can do so much more with a
permitting system fit for the 21st century.
Thank you.
[Mr. Farris' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Brandon Farris, Vice President, Energy and
Resources Policy, National Association of Manufacturers
Good morning, Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano and
distinguished members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity
to appear before you and for holding this important hearing today on
how permitting reform can build a stronger economy.
A. Introduction
My name is Brandon Farris. I come from a manufacturing family. My
grandparents worked their entire careers at the GE communications
products department in Lynchburg, Virginia. In Lynchburg, GE made two-
way FM radio and car-telephone systems for vehicles, portable two-way
radios, industrial paging systems, and data transmission systems. My
father worked in a printing press. Lynchburg is a manufacturing town,
and I have seen firsthand, through my own experience, how manufacturing
raises the quality of life for families and communities. Today, I serve
as the vice president of energy and resources policy at the National
Association of Manufacturers. The NAM is the largest manufacturing
association in the United States, representing small and large
manufacturers in every industrial sector. At the NAM, we advocate
policies that grow manufacturing in the United States and improve the
lives of everyone, including the families of the 13 million men and
women who make things in America.
For our industry to continue growing our economy, creating jobs and
developing the best products in the world, the United States must
update its permitting laws and procedures. Permitting delays and
associated costs are making it much harder for manufacturers to compete
and win in the global economy. Although these problems have persisted
for decades, the pandemic and recent supply chain disruptions have
exacerbated the situation and made it more apparent. Bipartisan
cooperation has led to major policy achievements in recent years,
notably with the CHIPS and Science Act, which provides important
incentives to spur domestic manufacturing of vital inputs used
industrywide, particularly semiconductors. The Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act represented a historic commitment to
revitalizing our country's crumbling infrastructure, modernizing it to
improve the quality of life for all Americans and to further bolster
our global competitiveness. Permitting reform should go hand-in-hand
with these achievements, as it will help us more efficiently realize
the promise of our national investments in domestic manufacturing and
infrastructure.
The NAM supports this committee's work to modernize outdated and
inefficient permitting processes. The manufacturing industry accounts
for approximately 11% of our national gross domestic product, and it
can grow even more if this red tape no longer stands in the way.
I would like to point out several areas where the current
permitting processes are most disruptive--and how reform in these areas
will bolster manufacturing in the U.S.
Transportation Infrastructure
Transportation infrastructure of all kinds is essential to
manufacturers in the U.S. Obtaining permit approvals for these projects
often takes years, and that timeline can be magnified if the review
process is not streamlined, as is often the case. Many companies are
unable to proceed with new domestic manufacturing projects because the
permitting process has tied them up and slowed the project to a crawl.
I would like to share some examples. Our members have reported that
National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 consultation processes
have taken five years each for separate key rail infrastructure
projects. One electric heavy-duty truck manufacturer reported that some
customers have refused deliveries of battery-electric trucks due to the
uncertainty surrounding the necessary utility infrastructure upgrades
to power the chargers. And the Federal Highway Administration averages
more than seven years and four months to get approvals for a road that
connects manufacturing facilities with their customers or employees
with their workplaces.
It is clear how these permitting delays are standing in the way of
our industry's ability to create jobs, grow and make more products in
the U.S.--as well as in the way of other national priorities. The
Department of Energy's draft National Transmission Needs Study,
released Feb. 24, points out that the national electric transmission
system would need to grow 57% by 2035 to meet the infrastructure needed
to reach the administration's clean energy goals as it relates to the
growing
light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicle industries.\1\ Removing
inefficiencies and streamlining permitting for charging infrastructure
projects is a high priority for manufacturers, especially those facing
state medium-and-heavy-duty zero-emission-vehicle sales mandates like
those in California, Washington and Massachusetts. And the passage of
the bipartisan IIJA in 2021, which the NAM strongly supported, could
revitalize our nationwide infrastructure systems, with upgrades,
updates and new projects--if we clear permitting backlogs and ease
processing timelines.

Energy Infrastructure and Environmental Reviews
Permitting challenges are also slowing the development of many
energy projects, including renewables. Manufacturers depend on access
to reliable and affordable energy to expand, which is why we support
reforms that would foster transparent, streamlined and timely federal
regulatory processes for the siting, permitting and licensing of energy
delivery infrastructure of all types. As NAM President and CEO Jay
Timmons recently said in testimony before the Senate Committee on
Environment and Public Works, manufacturers do not believe that
expanded domestic energy production, strong environmental protections
and a thriving economy are mutually exclusive goals. Permitting reform
can help achieve these goals in tandem.
For example, the siting of and infrastructure for zero-emissions
sources such as hydrogen power generation and transportation and for
advanced, small modular and micro-nuclear reactors have progressed far
too slowly. The Inflation Reduction Act included nearly $400 billion
for clean energy priorities, which might take years to be spent under
our current permitting system. And the White House Council on
Environmental Quality recently issued a report stating that, on
average, environmental impact statements, which are mandated under the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to outline the potential
impact of a proposed project on its surrounding environment, now take
on average four and a half years.\2\ More time is spent studying
potential environmental impacts than it takes to construct and operate
a clean hydrogen power generation facility. The Congressional Research
Service also states that NEPA is the most frequently litigated federal
environmental statute.\3\ Furthermore, a 2014 Government Accountability
Office study on NEPA analysis found that ``little information exists on
the costs and benefits of completing NEPA analyses'' and that
``agencies do not routinely track the costs of completing NEPA
analyses.'' \4\ NEPA can clearly be amended to reduce the time its
processes take and the associated compliance costs, with no real impact
on its environmental protections.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have a member that makes critical raw materials for
semiconductors, clean hydrogen and lithium-ion batteries. In many
cases, these products cannot be made without their chemicals, but
because of the regulatory uncertainty in obtaining a National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit in a timely manner, that member
recently announced that they will build a facility in the EU that
manufactures materials necessary to produce clean hydrogen.
Another NAM member reported that they needed to obtain a
construction permit, but before the permit could be granted, the
company needed survey permission to review the landscape and natural
resources in the area. It took more than six months to simply obtain
permission to conduct the survey. The delay in obtaining survey
permission cascaded into a more than 12-month delay in the permitting
process itself. It is important to note that this was listed as a
``priority project'' in the ``FAST-41'' Federal Infrastructure
Dashboard, which is supposed to increase permitting efficiency.
But delays in starting projects are not just caused by NEPA or the
Clean Water Act. One NAM member company reported lengthy delays of up
to an entire year for the issuance of permits by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers due to the failure of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to
complete the informal consultation required for confirming no adverse
project impacts under the Endangered Species Act. For an entire year,
potential workers sat on the sidelines and a community lost out on
economic opportunity waiting on informal paperwork that should not have
taken longer than 90 days to complete.
Staffing shortages at agencies are also becoming a significant
obstacle in the permitting process. In one case, a member company
reported that a permit renewal was delayed by more than six months
simply due to lack of staff. Another member reported that a Section 7
Endangered Species Act consultation was stalled for more than two years
as the National Marine Fisheries Service waited on a biologist to be
assigned to the project. Individually, each regulation is restrictive
enough, but when added together, they place a significant economic and
operational impact on manufacturers.
Resource Development
Our industry depends on access to our nation's plentiful natural
resources, and we believe that all processes involving them should be
done in an environmentally sound and responsible manner. However, some
restrictions on the development of these resources are hindering our
ability to strengthen domestic supply chains and making our industry
more reliant on raw material imports. The inconsistent administration
of critical mineral policies, for example, has limited our ability to
use a wide range of resources that exist on and beneath federal lands--
resources that are critical to producing everything from cars to
medical devices.
Various permitting agencies are required to weigh in on every
mining project in the U.S. For example, mining operations in the U.S.
typically require two Clean Water Act permits.\5\ Section 404 requires
mining operators to work with the Army Corps of Engineers to ensure
that the discharge of material is done in an environmentally sound way
that does not disrupt navigation to waters of the United States.
Section 402 permits authorized discharges from discrete conveyances--
called point sources into waters subject to federal jurisdiction. These
permits are just part of the mosaic of reviews that contribute to
delays in mining projects across the U.S. The National Mining
Association reports that Australia and Canada, two countries with
environmental protections that are arguably equivalent to or even more
stringent than those in the U.S., have mine permitting processes that
last two to three years on average, whereas in the U.S. the permitting
process averages seven to 10 years.\6\ Modernizing and streamlining
resource permitting and leasing policies will help stabilize
manufacturing supply chains, control costs for consumers, reduce our
reliance on foreign countries and create jobs in the U.S.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leaders in both parties have demonstrated a shared commitment to
increasing semiconductor production in the United States so that our
manufacturers--virtually all of which rely on chips for their products
or processes--have strong, domestic supply chains for these critical
inputs. With 88% of chips produced outside of the U.S.\7\ right now,
this is a crucial goal for not only our economic security but also our
national security. Yet, the raw materials for those chips, such as
lithium and cobalt, are still mined largely outside of the U.S. as
well.\8\ Our nation has reserves of both lithium and cobalt.\9\ To
access them, though, as Congress clearly envisions we will, also
requires congressional action to speed up permissions for developing
those resources in a responsible way.

New Environmental Standards
Manufacturing in the U.S. is cleaner than our global
competitors,\10\ owing largely to manufacturers' commitment to
modernizing and improving processes constantly, so as to leave the
planet better than we found it. Our industry also carefully upholds
federal standards for environmental protection. Unfortunately, when
federal agencies continually revise standards before current standards
are met and before states have implemented prior mandates, those
revised standards create unpredictability. As a result, the U.S. has
ceded new projects and facilities to other countries.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\10\ https://documents.nam.org/COMM/
NAM_Air_Quality_Standards_Analysis_Web_
Version.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Environmental Protection Agency is taking an aggressive
approach toward tightening regulations in several environmental
statutes. Unfortunately, these proposed regulatory changes are not
based on the best available science, often setting standards at or
below limits of detection, making compliance technically infeasible.
One such regulation is the EPA's proposed air quality regulations for
particulate matter (PM2.5). The regulation as proposed would mean that
nearly 40% of the U.S. population lives in an area that is out of
``attainment,'' which would make it extraordinarily difficult to create
manufacturing jobs, protect existing manufacturing jobs and could
prevent much needed infrastructure improvements in these areas. For
instance, one manufacturer that is already in a current nonattainment
area was forced to choose between spending $400 million more to meet
stringent emissions standards in a locality not in attainment or move
their facility entirely. The company chose to move, and that added $100
million to the project and caused a six-month delay. These are the
kinds of costs and decisions that we would witness on a much greater
scale if the new rule goes into effect.
Overly burdensome, shifting regulatory policies inherently affect
permitting, licensing and siting applications because they move the
goalposts of compliance with federal regulations. If instead we make
the process more predictable and consolidate the many complex layers of
review, the U.S. can continue to build on its strong record of
environmental stewardship by boosting domestic manufacturing, which is
environmentally cleaner than our international competitors.
Congressional Intent
The success of any legislative permitting reforms depends on proper
implementation. Ensuring the administration follows congressional
intent on recent and future statutory streamlining efforts such as One
Federal Decision is key. Establishing strict permit review timelines
and eliminating duplicative efforts across various federal agencies
help in reducing unnecessary delays. Moreover, key permitting
authorities are rife with ambiguity and inconsistent terminology and
warrant congressional intervention.

* * *

Permitting affects every aspect of our lives--from our economic
security to our national security. If we fail to modernize existing
processes, the U.S. is at risk of falling behind international
competitors that are taking every possible step to incentivize
manufacturing development. For instance, the EU released a new plan
known as the Net-Zero Industry Act, which looks to regain manufacturing
from lower-cost manufacturing centers in Asia and elsewhere. If the
United States does not act quickly, we could lose much needed
manufacturing investment to the EU and elsewhere in the world. On the
other hand, if we seize this opportunity to lead, there is no limit to
what manufacturers in the United States can accomplish--for the good of
our people and the good of the world.
As the NAM has emphasized consistently, permitting reform is not
about cutting corners. It is about keeping up with the world around us.
It is about ensuring that this country--a democracy rooted in free
enterprise--is not outpaced or outflanked or overtaken by nations that
do not share our values, that do not respect the environment or that do
not recognize the dignity of human rights.
Thank you for inviting me to testify today. I look forward to
continued engagement with members of this committee.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman for his testimony, as
well as all the other witnesses.
So, we will now turn to questions from Members. I recognize
myself for 5 minutes for questions.
I had the opportunity--I took the opportunity, I might say,
to read every word of each of the testimonies provided by our
panelists here today.
Mr. Farris, I was particularly struck by one of the final
paragraphs of your written testimony, and I want to highlight
this. It says: ``[P]ermitting reform is not about cutting
corners. It is about keeping up with the world around us. It is
about ensuring that this country--a democracy rooted in free
enterprise--is not outpaced or outflanked or overtaken by
nations that do not share our values, that do not respect the
environment or that do not recognize the dignity of human
rights.''
A little further above there, you say: ``If the United
States does not act quickly, we could lose much needed
manufacturing investment to the EU and elsewhere in the
world.''
Can you expound on that a little bit? What do we need in
this country? Certainty? What are other attributes of a
permitting system that will enable us to compete worldwide?
Mr. Farris. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And just one example.
So, for mining, for critical minerals, for semiconductors, for
electric vehicles, for what our Defense Department calls vital
and critical to our national defense.
In the U.S., a mine takes 7 to 10 years, on average, to
permit. When you look at Australia, when you look at Canada,
who has very similar permitting systems to us, very similar
environmental protections, permits there take 2 to 3 years.
There is certainty, and they move efficiently.
There is no direct number to years that it takes to permit
a mine, but we know we need to do it faster and we need to get
these products working to be able to increase our jobs and
increase our security.
Mr. Rouzer. Dr. Travnicek, I was intrigued with your
thoughts that you conveyed with your testimony. Can you talk a
little more about the Nationwide Permit 12?
You say: ``[O]ne solution to ease overly stringent federal
permitting requirements would be to adopt state-specific
regional conditions for the Corps' Nationwide Permit 12, which
applies to oil and gas pipelines, and Nationwide Permit 58,
which applies to any linear utility line.''
Can you expound on that a little more?
Ms. Travnicek. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for
the question.
Yes. In regards to looking at those nationwide permits and
how they could be utilized, that is where we have had our
agencies working with the Corps, trying to discuss what it
would look like from a State-specific regional condition,
knowing that there are those different regional conditions
across the country and how can we continue to utilize those
nationwide permits but knowing that, for instance, in North
Dakota, we have got that unique wetland, hydrological areas out
there, and we are the best known with our expertise that we
have at the State on what those impacts could be, and also how
we are identifying what they are.
So, by having those types of tools in place, that will help
us continue to streamline our efficiencies associated with
building the infrastructure projects.
Mr. Rouzer. Yes. I know in North Dakota, the weather can be
a little challenging from season to season, particularly the
winter season.
You mentioned that ``[s]ection 404 permitting delays are
especially harmful in North Dakota, due to our short
construction season.''
Can you talk about that cumulative effect a little bit?
Ms. Travnicek. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, in North
Dakota, right now would be our time to be starting to get out
in the field, but usually that can wrap up anywhere in that
October timeframe as well. So, if we are delayed by any sort of
decisions related to permits, we could lose a construction
season or two immediately, which, of course, leads to increases
in costs and uncertainties of when we can complete those
projects.
So, making sure, in regards to some of the discussion
already on timeliness of getting those permits, that is what we
would be looking for. And right now, there are uncertainties
with that.
Mr. Rouzer. Thank you much.
Mr. Conway, obviously, there are a lot of folks back home
in my district that are concerned about rate increases. We are
dealing with PFAS. New technology has been implemented there: A
carbon filtration system at Cape Fear Public Utility Authority;
I believe at CalStar Utilities, $60 million.
You have major upgrades that need to be made at wastewater
treatment facilities all around the country. These structures/
facilities weren't designed to last 50-, 100-plus years, and it
seems like everything is coming due all across the board.
Can you talk about the delicate balance of how do you
protect ratepayers, how do you deal with the rules and
regulations, and what we can do to streamline this so that we
are protecting water quality in every way, but also allowing
for a good playing field for you all to operate?
And I only have about 10 seconds, so, if you can keep it
brief. Sorry.
Mr. Conway. We have invested billions over the years. We
intend to invest billions into the future. The key is to invest
it in the right place and make sure the money is going to
actual water quality improvement and protecting our
communities. And really, regulatory certainty is a key to that.
Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. I thank the panel for
entertaining my questions.
I now turn to Mr. Larsen.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. I am prepared with questions. I
just didn't expect to cut in line in front of my colleague.
Mr. Rouzer. Well, I respect the ranking member of the full
committee.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. OK. Thank you. I hope to continue
to earn that respect. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
So, I want to start with a question for Secretary McIlwain.
Can you discuss some of the positive impacts of the Clean Water
State Revolving Fund that Maryland will be able to take
advantage of over the next 5 years because we passed the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law?
Ms. McIlwain. Yes. Thank you. We have been able to do a lot
in Maryland with the funds that have been available. We have
been able to upgrade more wastewater treatment plants. The
funding has contributed to restoration of the Chesapeake Bay.
We have been able to really help the disadvantaged communities
who otherwise didn't have the funding available to help upgrade
the water systems that are degraded.
And so, the historic funding that has been available has
really put us in a leading position and in a position to help
the citizens of Maryland.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. In some of those disadvantaged
communities or underserved communities, how would you
characterize the infrastructure compared to, say, a more
developed area in your State or maybe a higher economic----
Ms. McIlwain [interrupting]. They just don't have the
funding to upgrade as quickly as other counties and States and
local governments who have more funding. It is all about the
amount of taxes that you are collecting and rates that you are
charging.
When you are in a disadvantaged community, you can't charge
a lot in those communities. And so, they are behind. They don't
have the infrastructure nor the funding.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. So, looking at that from an
opposite way, the debt limit plan that this House voted on, it
would have resulted in a 23-percent across-the-board cut to
discretionary spending, including clean water investment.
What would that mean for a State like Maryland?
Ms. McIlwain. It would mean--it would put us back. And it
would mean all the funding that we have been able to, again,
give to those communities, we wouldn't be able to do that at
the rate in which we have been.
There are a lot of investments that we have made that we
have been able to forgive those loans as well because of the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. We wouldn't be able to forgive
those loans. And, again, so, the economics in those
communities--we wouldn't be able to help as much as we have
been.
Restoring the Chesapeake Bay, all the funding that we have
put toward the Chesapeake Bay as well, that impacts
disadvantaged communities as well.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Now, I recognize nothing is
perfect and that there is a friendly competition about which
State has the greatest estuary in America: Washington State and
the Puget Sound or Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. I understand
that. And maybe California. You are taking my time, John [to
Mr. Garamendi]. Maybe California.
That said, what work is yet to be done? And could you
include in your answer some of these issues on permitting
reform? What work can be done on restoration of clean water,
and what work can be done on permitting reform?
Ms. McIlwain. So, we have to meet our total maximum daily
load goals by 2025 for the Chesapeake Bay. And so, we work with
a lot of local governments, committees, the Chesapeake Bay
Foundation, the Chesapeake Bay Program. We work together to
find ways to continue to improve the Chesapeake Bay.
If we are not able to continue to fund those programs as
well as--again, we are using money to upgrade the wastewater
treatment plants, all that is pollution getting into the bay.
So, just going backwards. Everything that we are doing is
trying to move us forward, and we can't afford to have any
delays in funding and contribution to eliminating pollution.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Have you looked at permitting
reform in your State, or do you have some thoughts about what
Congress has looked at?
Ms. McIlwain. In terms of permitting reform, in terms of
our State, I know from my agency, we are looking at making sure
that we are reforming permits.
It is in a Federal-wide initiative, though. We realize that
with the bipartisan--``we'' meaning the Federal Government,
too. We realize that with the bipartisan infrastructure loan
money, the funding, it is a lot. And you can't have projects,
they are not going to get done if the permits aren't
accelerated and the unnecessary steps are taken out.
I have been a part of those efforts on a Federal level for
years. And I am bringing that same expertise to Maryland so
that we can try and streamline the permitting process as much
as we can. We are working on that now.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. That is all fair. That is great.
Thank you very much for helping us out today. I appreciate it.
I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
I now recognize Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
One of the biggest issues that--I want to say, first of
all, thank you to the panel of witnesses for joining us today.
And I think the Clean Water Act is one of the critical
pieces of legislation over the past century. And to have a
productive workforce and a competitive industry, we need to
ensure that the resources they depend on are protected, but
that doesn't mean we cannot do anything. And coming from an
island that is undergoing a full recovery from hurricanes, I
know how difficult it is to process the permitting between the
Federal agencies and the local agencies, actually to get
something done.
So, I am glad some of the witnesses today just touched a
little bit about those permitting processes.
Mr. Conway, in your testimony, you bring up the Clean Water
Act National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, and you
state that these protections are threatened by opponents of a
project bringing up suits against the wastewater processors
based on things that were not contained in the permits.
You state, to paraphrase, that utilities must not be faced
with the imposition of ad hoc permitting requirements through
litigation and call attention to permits that use vague
language.
My question will be, do you believe that this is a strategy
to indirectly force the States or municipalities or regulators
to take action against third parties, that is, for example, to
make a regulator force an industry to shut down an activity
because otherwise the public treatment plants that cannot
handle that discharge will be noncompliant and lose funding?
Mr. Conway. Thank you, Congresswoman. The permit system is
designed to provide an opportunity for all interested
stakeholders to get involved during the permitting process,
including those who are going to have concerns about particular
discharges or pollutants or impacts to water quality.
That is a very robust process that is delegated down--that
moves down into the States. EPA has various interactions,
depending on the delegation status of the State. But it is at
that point where we really have the opportunity to protect our
waters. I feel like that is the first point.
Once the permit is set, the discharger has to meet those
permit limits, and if it does not, it is in violation. And
there are a number of compliance tools that both the State and
the EPA and even nongovernmental organizations can take in a
noncompliant situation.
When you have a discharge that wasn't contemplated in the
permit and, therefore, there isn't a design of the system to
manage that, there is an opportunity to rectify that in an
updated permit. And that process is frequently undertaken by
EPA and/or the States, depending on the regime.
So, we have lots of places to check in to protect our water
bodies. The big picture that we are trying to promote here is
that, once a permit term is set, those who have constructed,
designed, and operated the systems really can't just turn them
off and on to change because a new constituent is introduced.
So, we are really trying to work on a big ship moving down
the harbor here that cleans up as much as we possibly can with
the certainty we have under our permits.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. You mentioned, as a critique to the
existing system for water standards criteria, that EPA
typically takes comments and subjects them to review. But
because the Agency takes the position that it is just guidance
and not rules, they do not have to follow the full procedural
requirements for approving regulation, including periods for
comments and responses.
So, my question will be, I mean, are you proposing, then,
that the law be amended to specify explicitly that EPA will
approve a standard regulation through the normal administrative
procedure, or do you propose that the Congress incorporate into
the legislation specifics about what should be in those
regulations?
Mr. Conway. Thank you for the question, ma'am. Actually,
the former would be preferable, to incorporate explicitly into
the Clean Water Act an opportunity for comment and
participation in that process.
EPA's position has been, because it is not a formal
rulemaking, that States can adopt these rules if they want to
adopt them is correct. However, the States almost always do
adopt those rules. They don't have the resources to come up
with their own water quality research and individual
assessments.
So, that is what we would like to see happen. I think that
would be great for our communities. And, frankly, for the EPA,
it would be assistance for them to have our input into that
process.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you. My time expired. I yield
back.
Mr. Rouzer. I now recognize the gentlelady and my partner
from California, Mrs. Napolitano.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Secretary McIlwain, last week, the Scientific and Technical
Advisory Committee for the Chesapeake Bay Program released a
report that stressed the need for additional measures to
address nutrient pollution to the bay if cleanup goals are to
be achieved. The committee report highlighted the progress made
in reducing nutrient pollution from the wastewater treatment
plants, even as populations in the bay watershed have
increased. However, the report also warned that progress in
addressing nonpoint sources of nutrient pollution has lagged
and has been insufficient to meet the overall water quality
goals of the bay.
What additional steps do you recommend for addressing
ongoing nonpoint sources of nutrient pollution to the bay?
Ms. McIlwain. Well, first, nonpoint sources of pollution
are the largest issue for us, for the country, because you
can't detect them as quickly as you can the point sources.
I think that what we need to do is prioritize the projects
that have multiple benefits. And that includes carbon
sequestration, ones that also have flood resiliency, as well as
cleaner water.
So, we need to look at those projects and try to get more
out of the projects that we have so that we can start
addressing the nonpoint source issues.
Mrs. Napolitano. For those who might suggest that
additional investments in the bay are too costly or have little
economic benefit to Marylanders, how would you respond to
justify the investment, to all of you?
Ms. McIlwain. I am sorry, repeat the last piece.
Mrs. Napolitano. How would you respond to justify the
investment when they say that it would be too costly to do it
for the bay?
Ms. McIlwain. We don't have enough funding now, so, it is
never too costly. We need more money for investment in the
Chesapeake Bay. We need to keep moving forward. We don't have
room to go backwards.
The funding that we have--as I spoke about earlier, the
funding that we were able to get from the funding has allowed
us to upgrade the wastewater treatment plants, improve and
restore the Chesapeake Bay, and help disadvantaged communities.
We have more work to do, and I have that in my testimony. There
is a lot more that we need to do and that we will do.
Mrs. Napolitano. Can you highlight the economic benefits
the bay has received?
Ms. McIlwain. I am sorry?
Mrs. Napolitano. The economic benefits the bay has
received.
Ms. McIlwain. The economic benefits, we have created--the
Chesapeake Bay, just from the funding, I think it is 35,000
jobs have been created from the funding that we have received.
So, there are a lot of economic benefits that we are
getting. More companies are getting more money, more loans and,
again, more loan forgiveness. There has been a lot of economic
benefits to the communities.
Mrs. Napolitano. The jobs and the water quality.
Ms. McIlwain. And the water quality has improved.
Mrs. Napolitano. Anybody else?
Mr. Conway. Yes, Ranking Member Napolitano, I would say
that I don't believe that anyone thinks that clean water is too
costly in the broad sense, but it is important to prioritize
what we have to do, because it all can't be done at once.
And infrastructure issues across the country, just
literally delivering and taking clean water are key, absolutely
key. When we start adding things--nutrients are also key. And
almost all of our clean water treatment plants are set up to
manage nutrients. It is a heavy lift to get them to lower and
lower levels, but everyone is committed to that.
Once we get to emerging contaminants like PFAS, the cost
associated with that and the uncertainty and the technology
right now, on top of infrastructure and nutrients, is going to
put an incredible strain on our folks. And so, I think
prioritizing all these things and these investments is going to
be very important for us.
Mrs. Napolitano. What should the role of the Federal
Government be, or what would you expect it to be?
Mr. Conway. I am sorry, what?
Mrs. Napolitano. The role of the Federal Government.
Mr. Conway. I think I would love to see the Federal
Government set a priorities list on pollutants. I think that
would be difficult to do, but it would be something akin to
setting water rights issues in the Colorado River. You could
tell us what you want us to do first. We will put every bit of
energy we have into that.
One of the things I would suggest is that solutions to
clean water often implicate, for instance, air issues. You
pollute to create clean water. You use chemicals to create
clean water. And so, the cleaner the water gets, the dirtier
the air gets. And so, we would like to see a prioritization
system that helps us guide our investments.
Mrs. Napolitano. But then the Federal Government doesn't
know the situation in every State, so, you would have to go
differently.
Mr. Conway. I recognize that. That would be----
Mrs. Napolitano [interrupting]. I yield back, Mr. Chair.
Thank you.
Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentlelady.
Next up on our side is Mr. Van Orden for 5 minutes.
Mr. Van Orden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
I find it fascinating that many of my colleagues wrap
themselves in the Richard Nixon flag when it comes to the Clean
Water Act, which I don't think they would normally do. When we
speak about congressional intent and following congressional
intent, I cannot think of a greater example of that other than
a bipartisan, bicameral resolution that was passed in the House
and the Senate that went to President Joe Biden's desk asking
to repeal the waters of the United States rules changes that
was vetoed by President Biden.
So, to be clear, the intent of Congress was to not have
these rule changes go through on the waters of the United
States, and that was vetoed by the President of the United
States. So, clearly, the congressional intent is not being
followed by the executive branch, and that is a blatant
political act, and I think it is inappropriate.
Secretary--it is McWain?
Ms. McIlwain. McIlwain.
Mr. Van Orden. McIlwain. Sorry, ma'am. What percentage of
Maryland is dedicated to agriculture?
Ms. McIlwain. What percentage of Maryland is dedicated to
agriculture?
Mr. Van Orden. Land-use agriculture?
Ms. McIlwain. It represents a large portion of Maryland. I
don't have the exact percentage, but it is huge.
Mr. Van Orden. OK. Dr. Travnicek, what percentage of North
Dakota is----
Ms. McIlwain [interrupting]. About half.
Mr. Van Orden. About half?
Ms. McIlwain. Yes.
Mr. Van Orden. Dr. Travnicek, what percentage of North
Dakota is dedicated to agriculture production?
Ms. Travnicek. Representative, so, for North Dakota, yes,
it is a very large percentage as well. It is our number one
industry in the State of North Dakota.
Mr. Van Orden. OK. And, Secretary McIlwain, what percentage
of Maryland would be subject to no notice, no consent
inspection by the Federal Government if the waters of the
United States rules changes are enacted?
Ms. McIlwain. I would say a large percentage would be
impacted. You said by the waters of the United States, by the
new rule, is that what you are asking me?
Mr. Van Orden. Do you have any idea, like an actual
percentage?
Ms. McIlwain. I don't.
Mr. Van Orden. OK. Dr. Travnicek, what percentage of North
Dakota would be subject to no notice, no consent inspection by
the Federal Government if the rules changes or the waters of
the United States were enacted?
Ms. Travnicek. So, Representative, as we are looking at
those rule changes, I mean, pretty much every industry in North
Dakota would be impacted by those changes as we are looking at
knowing that wetlands are now included within that new rule. We
are fortunate, right, that we have got the stay right now that
is not impacting our State where we are at, that 2015 decision
related to the Clean Water Act, but if that were to go away and
if something did happen, yes. So, you have got our energy
industry, our agriculture industry. This agency trying to get
water to people, we would be impacted.
Mr. Van Orden. Madam Secretary, if you were considering
Maryland in relationship to North Dakota, would you say that
Maryland is more heavily regulated than North Dakota?
Ms. McIlwain. I am sorry. Can you repeat the last piece?
Mr. Van Orden. If you were to juxtapose Maryland with the
State of North Dakota, would you say that Maryland is more
heavily regulated than the State of North Dakota? I know what
Dr. Travnicek is going to say.
Ms. McIlwain. I am not sure.
Mr. Van Orden. Dr. Travnicek, in relationship to Maryland,
would you say that Maryland is more heavily regulated than
North Dakota?
Ms. Travnicek. Representative, so, I do not know all the
regulations that are within Maryland, but as we are looking at
regulation in North Dakota, we always try to do the innovation
over regulation. That is what we are always looking for. We are
looking to try to streamline our permitting processes, making
sure that we can get infrastructure to the different economies
that we are striving for within the State.
Mr. Van Orden. Thank you.
Madam Secretary, do you think that the regulations that
apply to the State of Maryland should apply to the State of
North Dakota?
Ms. McIlwain. I mean, I look at it--well, yes. Well,
because we are trying to protect upstream States from polluting
downstream. So----
Mr. Van Orden [interrupting]. Madam Secretary, is North
Dakota upstream from Maryland?
Ms. McIlwain. Well, my point was we----
Mr. Van Orden [interrupting]. I understand your point,
ma'am. Here is my point. We are part of a Republic. So, Dr.
Travnicek, when she is speaking about the regulations that
apply to people in North Dakota, I don't think that she should
be able to tell you what to do, and I don't think you should be
able to tell her what to do, because you live in very unique
States. I appreciate everything that you are saying. I
appreciate what you are saying, but there is a very specific
reason that our Constitution was written the way it was, and I
do not think the Federal Government has a place in dictating
how you should live your life, nor Dr. Travnicek's in
relationship to the waters of the United States.
And the answer to Wisconsin is 85 percent of the Third
Congressional District of the State of Wisconsin would be
subject to no notice, no consent inspection by the Federal
Government if these rules changes took place. Thank you very
much.
I yield back my time that has already expired, Mr.
Chairman.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Garamendi.
Mr. Garamendi. No, I am not going to do it. I am not going
to engage in the debate about the role of the Federal
Government versus the State governments and the like. I will
just let that go for a few moments.
So, we were talking about reform here of the various
permitting processes. I actually do have a reform I would like
to have all of you comment upon it.
Presently, the NPDES permit is for 5 years. And so, Mr.
Conway, your agencies and others seek a permit to discharge,
and it is 5 years.
About the time you get underway on the construction of
whatever it is you want to do, it is now time for another 5-
year permit. And so, you are constantly permitting.
The reform that we have is in H.R. 1181, which would,
instead of a 5-year, give a 10-year permit for the discharge
for the public agencies. We think it is a pretty good idea. We
want to get these projects underway. If there is an upgrade
necessary, then get about doing it without having to, once
again within that 5-year period, start all over. So, we are
looking at a 10-year permit.
And, Mr. Conway, if you could comment on this. Previously,
your organization endorsed it. It is a new Congress. We are
going to give it another try.
Chairman Rouzer, we would love to have your support on
this.
Mr. Conway.
Mr. Conway. Thank you, Congressman. I know NACWA has been
in support of that idea, that any increase in certainty and any
increase in lead times to plan, execute, and operate projects
would be, in our world, helpful. Frankly, the reality, to your
point, is that if you are going to add, for instance, tertiary
treatment to a large wastewater treatment plant, that is a 10-
year process in and of itself to get to those low, low, low
limits. So, that longer lead time and run time would be very
helpful for utilities.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you.
The other witnesses, if you care to comment about this
issue of moving from a 5-year NPDES deadline or permit to a 10-
year, please do.
Dr. Travnicek.
Ms. Travnicek. Representative, so, as you are looking at
that 5-year to 10-year permit, of course, you get more of that
certainty of being able to stay within the bounds of a longer
one, but that would be my comment at this point.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you.
Secretary McIlwain, why did you leave California to come to
Maryland? You were doing such a good job in California, but
here you are. So, your comments.
Ms. McIlwain. I will just comment on that.
Mr. Garamendi. Let that go.
Ms. McIlwain. I came to Maryland because Maryland is home
for me. I love California, but I had to return home and make
sure that I am protecting the environment in Maryland.
Mr. Garamendi. Well, carry on then. What about this 10-year
permit versus the 5-year permit?
Ms. McIlwain. I don't really have a comment on that. I have
thoughts, but I'd rather keep my comments to myself.
Mr. Garamendi. Well, I will send you all of the
information, you can then comment in writing later on.
Ms. McIlwain. OK.
Mr. Garamendi. Mr. Farris.
Mr. Farris. Congressman, one thing that manufacturers
constantly ask for is regulatory certainty. This would give
them certainty. Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Mr. Garamendi. At least within the 10-year period of time--
--
Mr. Farris [interposing]. Yes, sir.
Mr. Garamendi [continuing]. Where the projects can actually
get underway, the construction can begin, completed hopefully
within that period of time. And there will be another
opportunity, any changes that have occurred in the standards,
the emission standards, could be dealt with subsequently.
Mr. Rouzer, I would love to have your support on this as
part of our reform. It would be great to include this in it.
With that, I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Babin.
Dr. Babin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I really appreciate it.
Thank all of you witnesses for being here as well. We
appreciate your testimony.
Mr. Farris, given your role with the National Association
of Manufacturers, I would like to hear your perspective on a
few challenges that are being faced by our manufacturers today
in our country.
Members of the committee have heard people from many
different economic sectors detail their frustrations with our
permitting processes. And from your perspective, what are the
main challenges faced by manufacturers in the United States due
to this permitting process?
Mr. Farris. Thank you, Congressman. And how much time do
you have, sir?
Dr. Babin. I have got several more questions, so, just
maybe hit the high points.
Mr. Farris. I can say the biggest thing is the delays. We
have had one member who had to delay being issued a U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers permit merely because the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service wouldn't give them informal paperwork saying
that there is no environmental impact. So, for a year,
potential workers sat on the sidelines, a community lost out on
economic opportunity for informal paperwork that should have
taken 90 days.
Dr. Babin. Yes. Absolutely.
Critical minerals are something more and more Americans are
becoming aware of now that we are seeing some really new stuff
on this. Our reliance on Chinese companies and the critical
mineral supply chain is dangerous and potentially disastrous as
China continues to aggressively come after the American
economy.
Generally speaking, how is the reliance on Chinese critical
minerals impacting our manufacturing capabilities, and how is
the inconsistent administration of critical mineral policies
impacting the industry?
Mr. Farris. Significantly. Significantly. If we learned
anything over the past 3 years, it is about supply chain, and
it is about manufacturing more things in America. As a country,
we have agreed we need to manufacture semiconductors. We need
to manufacture batteries. We cannot do those without the
critical minerals. And as I mentioned earlier, right now in the
U.S., it takes 7 to 10 years to get a mine permitted. In
Canada, 2 to 3. In Australia, 2 to 3. That is how we lose on an
international scale.
Dr. Babin. Absolutely. Last question, if you could leave
myself and my fellow members on the committee here with one key
takeaway today, what steps do you recommend that would help our
manufacturers? What steps should we take to help our
manufacturers?
Mr. Farris. I would say the two guiding principles are
deadlines. Deadlines, because that creates certainty. And then
judicial review. There needs to be judicial review. It needs to
meaningful and timely. And those are our two guiding principles
for permit reform, sir.
Dr. Babin. OK. Anything else you would like to add, because
I still have got a little time?
Mr. Farris. I just wanted to say thank you to the committee
and thank you for your leadership on these issues. This is
something that I believe is a bipartisan issue and that we all
need to know that we need to figure out how to fix.
Dr. Babin. Absolutely should be bipartisan, and our economy
and the American national security are dependent upon that.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields.
Mrs. Sykes.
Mrs. Sykes. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you for the
panel for coming to testify today. This has been a riveting
conversation as many of us here, we are deeply concerned about
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in ensuring that we are able
to complete these projects. It is especially important in
communities like mine in Ohio who continue to struggle with
water quality. And I know the Clean Water Act is especially
important for us.
Not my city, but we have heard about the ``mistake on the
lake,'' when a lake catches on fire, or algal blooms in the
northwestern part of the district or the State, where we are
constantly trying to keep mineral deposits and overgrowths that
negatively impact our water supply. So, I appreciate all of you
being here to discuss this very important role of the
infrastructure act.
And specifically, I am going to go off script just a little
bit because, Mr. Farris, you had a very interesting point to
the question about permitting, and I know we are trying to get
to the root cause of why the permitting is taking so long and
why we can't get these projects done, even though we have the
resources for it. And you specifically mentioned delays. And I
want to ask you a question about the debt bill that was
recently passed out from this Congress. Because what we
understand is there will about 22-percent cuts across the
board. And I heard you mention the Army Corps of Engineers,
which would mean eliminating employment and employment
opportunities for people to move those permitting requests
through.
You talked about the judicial process. You talked about
some other Federal agencies, but with the 22-percent cut across
the board, which would ultimately mean decimating the
workforce, it would seem like the delays would only increase.
Is that correct? Yes or no, Mr. Farris?
Mr. Farris. Ma'am, what we are seeing across the board is--
--
Mrs. Sykes [interrupting]. Yes or no, Mr. Farris?
Mr. Farris. Yes.
Mrs. Sykes. Mr. Farris? Yes.
Mr. Farris. Yes, yes.
Mrs. Sykes. Yes. OK. So, it seems like the bill that we got
from the majority would only exacerbate the permitting process
in making it longer. Yes or no?
Mr. Farris. I cannot comment on that. What I can say is
that on the debt ceiling, the NAM supports--the full faith and
credit of the United States cannot be questioned. We also
support permitting reform, and we would love Congress to figure
out how to be able to do both.
Mrs. Sykes. Thank you, Mr. Farris. I appreciate you saying
that, because I do hope that the Speaker is willing to do the
work to make sure that we get that done and that we do maintain
the full faith and credit of the United States.
I will answer the question for you since you would not. It
would, in fact, make your permitting process much longer and
exacerbate the process and make it much more difficult for you
to do the manufacturing that you want.
Semiconductors in Ohio are incredibly important. Bridge and
road building is incredibly important in Ohio with so many
highway and byways and centerline miles. It is going to be very
detrimental. So, I do hope that we have the full picture as we
are talking about that question.
But, Mr. Conway and Madam Secretary, perhaps this next
question is for you, because water affordability continues to
be a problem for folks all across the country, whether you are
in urban areas where I represent, suburban areas where I also
represent, as well as rural areas where I represent.
And so, I just want to talk to you and ask you the question
of: What happens if we fail to pay the bills as a country and
we don't have the resources to continue to fund these projects?
How are people going to afford water, clean water, in their
communities?
And, Mr. Conway, I will start with you and, Madam
Secretary, if you wouldn't mind finishing.
Mr. Conway. Thank you, Congresswoman. Obviously, our
funding structure is primarily our ratepayers. We do have some
assistance from the State. Many in our State use Federal funds
as well through the SRF. It is very important for those
utilities to be able to use those funds, the infrastructure act
funds flowing through there.
As those funds decrease, then again, we have to get to
really high-priority projects only. You do see that there have
been failing water systems around the country that were not
able to continually invest in their systems, and then you reach
a point where, frankly, there is an emergency in delivering the
services. The burden on ratepayers can only go so far. Folks
will not pay their bills at a certain point, and we do see that
in emergency times and difficult economic times. And so,
ultimately, there becomes a spot where you can only invest the
funds you have and you are holding on and putting Band-Aids on
things. So, funding is critical to make all this work.
Mrs. Sykes. Thank you, Mr. Conway.
Madam Secretary?
Ms. McIlwain. Yes. The bipartisan infrastructure loans help
make the projects affordable in the disadvantaged communities.
And so, without the funding--again, I said it earlier, but to
even think about raising the rates in some of these communities
would be an economic disaster for those families.
Mrs. Sykes. Thank you, Madam Secretary.
And again, just want to highlight how important it is for
us to figure out the debt ceiling and not move forward with
what we passed here in the House. And my community specifically
relies upon low-interest and no-interest loans to keep our
ratepayers from not having to pay more so that they can
actually afford not only their water, but their housing, their
gas, their groceries, and all those important things.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Westerman.
Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to
the witnesses today.
Mr. Conway, last month, the Arkansas Water and Wastewater
Association visited my office and mentioned its members have
concerns about EPA PFAS regulation under CERCLA and how that
would affect their operations.
As processors in the water system, can you talk more about
how water utilities are going to have to navigate this
potential situation?
Mr. Conway. Thank you, Mr. Congressman. The potential
CERCLA issue for water and wastewater providers is a really
serious issue for us. We are passive receivers of PFAS. It
comes from uses in products and some cases industrial. In my
particular jurisdiction, it is almost all domestic use that is
sending PFAS into the system. Then the PFAS, because we do not
have technology to take it out of wastewater, it passes into
the biosolids and it passes into the liquid stream in some
part. We are probably many years away from a large wastewater
plant, such as mine, being able to manage PFAS, and we are
working as hard as we can to get there.
But to the extent that CERCLA liability attaches to
anything that comes out of our publicly owned plant, costs our
ratepayers a tremendous amount. Effectively, they would be
paying to be poisoned. And without a CERCLA exemption for
wastewater and water treatment folks, the public is just going
to pay for the cleanup of a product that was manufactured by
other people.
Mr. Westerman. So, you think there are exemptions from
CERCLA for wastewater treatment plants that should be
considered by Congress?
Mr. Conway. I believe that Congress could consider an
exemption for publicly owned wastewater and water treatment
plants, yes. I think that would be appropriate.
Mr. Westerman. And talking about wastewater treatment, I am
going to transition to Mr. Farris here, but I remember a few
years back, we had a hearing, and I think it was somebody from
the city of Spokane testified about regulations that were being
put out by the State of Washington. And I believe it was dioxin
they were regulating, which we all know dioxin is bad, but the
regulations actually required levels below an amount that you
could test for. Like, it was impossible to even test for the
levels that were being stipulated in this regulation.
And you very well described what the permitting process is
like in the real world. That is where I came from doing
engineering work. I worked on air discharge permits, water
discharge permits, waded through the mountains of paperwork,
waited on agencies to reply back, having to correct their
mistakes and help them through. You talked about how permitting
is hurting transportation, how it is hurting energy, how it is
hurting resource development. And then you talked about the
importance of judicial review and having it done timely. I
agree with all of that.
I want you to go into a little bit more detail. There is a
section in your testimony where you talked about
PM
2.5
. And just explain what this is like in what I
call the real world. Because I saw this in my engineering
career go from best available technology to maximum available
control technology. And you get to a point where you are
spending extraordinary amounts of money for small amounts of
gain in the reduction of particulates.
Can you tell--when PM
2.5
--what size are those
particles?
Mr. Farris. So, think of a strand of hair, and that is four
times as large as--much, much larger than anything on the
PM
2.5
. And thank you for the question.
So, we have recently commissioned a study with Oxford
Economics on the PM
2.5
and the regulations. And what
we see there is at the level of 12 right now where it is at and
where EPA wants to go, it will take more than 40 percent of our
entire population into areas of nonattainment.
Mr. Westerman. And that means--just so people understand,
nonattainment means you cannot emit any more particulates in an
area that is a nonattainment zone. So, when business looks at,
they say, we can't build here, we will go somewhere else. What
does that do to economic growth?
Mr. Farris. We have a story with a member. They were forced
to spend $400 million. They wanted to build a new facility in
an area that was currently in nonattainment. This is before the
new rule came out. And they would have had to have spent $400
million just to be able to get the air within attainment. What
they ended up doing was they moved it at a cost of $100 million
and caused a 6-month delay in the project.
Mr. Westerman. And when you throw this out and say
attainment, nonattainment, people might think, well, they
should just spend all that because it is for the good of
society, but I don't think people realize the minuscule benefit
that you get for investing all of that capital, and it never
stops. The goalpost always moves, and there is always some new
technology out there.
And I know I am out of time, but I was just going to ask,
how far ahead of the rest of the world are we on reducing
particulate emissions where we are already at?
Mr. Farris. Thank you. And quickly on the study, it showed
that we are amongst the best and the cleanest in the world in
manufacturing.
Mr. Westerman. Thank you.
Mr. Rouzer. Ms. Scholten, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you so much
to our witnesses for helping us understand the critical role of
the Clean Water Act.
Water is a way of life in Michigan. The district that I
represent is part of the Great Lakes watershed and supplies
freshwater and related natural resources, not only for
Michiganders and west Michiganders, but truly for the entire
country. We know that the value of our water in Michigan's
Third Congressional District is at a premium. Unfortunately,
PFAS contamination is also a prevalent concern. Just yesterday,
the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team identified three more
areas of concern in west Michigan. The safety of our drinking
water and the health of our communities is at stake.
My first question is for you, Mr. Conway. In your
testimony, you talk about the financial impact of cleaning up
PFAS in cities and towns. Can you talk a little bit more about
those costs? What are the costs that these cities and towns are
incurring, and how can municipalities, localities, go about
accessing dollars from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to
cover them?
Mr. Conway. Thank you, Ms. Congresswoman. Currently, the
drinking water folks are experiencing a little bit different
process than the wastewater folks. In wastewater, we are in a
sampling and testing phase. We are finding out what is in the
influent and effluent. And the challenges in testing are
significant. Testing methodologies are still being approved.
Very few labs actually go through this testing process. So,
there is a premium on getting the right labs and the cost of
doing that. And many of the smaller systems are being really
heavily burdened by just the costs involved with just finding
out how much PFAS is in their system.
So, to the extent that infrastructure or other Federal
funds can be designated not just for capital projects
associated with PFAS, but for finding out what is in the stream
and what we are going to do with it before we start building
things, that would be really helpful for large and small
utilities.
I think one of the big challenges in the long term here is
going to be that this is not just a capital construction cost
issue. It is going to be an operational cost issue. The current
technology is filtration, which for drinking water systems is
possible because they have pretty clean water sources.
Wastewater, much more difficult for large systems, and managing
the operating costs of constantly changing filters.
And then, frankly, what are we going to do with this stuff?
That has not determined by EPA or anybody else. That could be a
significant cost, especially if CERCLA liability attaches to
PFAS. Landfills may not take it. I don't know what we will do
with it. So, the cost centers are really around those areas
right now in the wastewater community.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you.
My second question is for Secretary McIlwain, and it
pertains to new infrastructure improving water quality. As of
2021, Michigan is estimated to have close to half a million
lead pipes currently carrying water. In Michigan, we saw up
close the devastating impacts of lead on children during the
Flint water crisis.
While I am proud of the progress that the State is making
in cleaning up our water supply, I represent a district, a ZIP
Code, the 49507 region of Grand Rapids, that is ranked the
second worst in the State for the number of children aged 5 or
younger that have elevated lead levels in their blood. While
efforts have begun to replace these pipes that lead to homes in
this ZIP Code, it remains one of the most underserved and
gentrified ZIP Codes in my city, which is part of why
contamination levels got so bad in the first place. It is here
where I see the social and environmental determinants of health
negatively impacting families across the city.
So, my question for you is: How are you ensuring that water
quality improvement efforts are being equitably implemented?
Ms. McIlwain. Well, we have the same issues with lead, but
we have a robust program as well in terms of lead protection
for children. We have an EJ environmental screening tool that
we use for a variety of things. We use it for grants and for
funding. We can also see where we are starting to add health
indicators into those environmental screens, so, we do use that
to identify. But we do have a system in place where we are
looking at where can those funds be most utilized. And it is in
those areas where we can see children are suffering the most.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you. My time is about up, so, I yield
back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentlelady yields back.
Mr. Ezell, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I appreciate the committee continuing to highlight how the
permitting process is creating harmful delays of critical
infrastructure projects across the country. Since I have been
on this committee, it seems like that is what we talk about
every time, is permitting. Costs are getting higher and
timelines are getting longer, both because of the uncertainty
placed on the industry by the Biden administration.
Mr. Farris, the aggregates industry plays an important role
in building our Nation's infrastructure. How does the current
interpretation of the Clean Water Act potentially affect the
procurement and use of building materials, such as aggregates
which are vital to public works projects, that benefits south
Mississippi like water treatment systems and flood control?
Mr. Farris. Sorry. One more time, sir.
Mr. Ezell. How does the current interpretation of the Clean
Water Act potentially affect the procurement and use of
building materials, such as aggregates which are vital to
public works projects, that benefits south Mississippi like
water treatment systems and flood control?
Mr. Farris. Thank you, sir. What we see are delays up and
down the board, whether you are getting equipment, whether you
are preparing your permits, whether you are building a road to
your facility. The current process creates delays. Whether it
is 4 years, 4\1/2\, 7 years, that builds uncertainty into this
process, and that means that the jobs aren't happening in those
areas.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you. Considering the potential impact of
the Clean Water Act's current interpretation on infrastructure
projects that depend on aggregate materials, what
recommendations would you make for a more balanced
interpretation that still protects our water resources?
Mr. Farris. What we have seen is we have seen that
deadlines can work. We have seen in other countries that have
environmental protections that are similar to us, they can get
things done in 2 to 3 years when we get them done in 7 to 10.
So, deadlines that we have to meet along with the One Federal
Decision. Make one agency in charge of this. Everyone answers
to them. What we have seen up and down the board is other
agencies not getting in informal paperwork, other agencies not
coordinating. So, we need One Federal Decision, and we need
some hard deadlines for them to be able to meet, sir.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
Dr. Travnicek, given that aggregate materials are a key
component of many public infrastructure projects, can you
discuss the potential consequences of an overly expansive and
unclear interpretation of the Clean Water Act?
Ms. Travnicek. So, as we are looking at the expansiveness
with the Clean Water Act and you are looking at infrastructure,
so, yes, it comes down to those permits, those timelines, try
to make sure that that is a consistent process for us to go
through. Because right now, that leads to issues with supply
chains that might happen, also getting contractors on site. So,
if there are some issues that come up with not being able to
have the permit in place, that leads to the delays. So, that is
where just having some of that consistency.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. Burlison, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Burlison. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wasn't ready, but
I do have questions.
So, this is also for Dr. Travnicek. Travnicek?
Ms. Travnicek. Travnicek, yes.
Mr. Burlison. OK. I came from the State legislature. I am a
10th Amendment guy. Do you believe that States play an
important role when it comes to protecting their own waters?
And how do States like your State of North Dakota care for your
waters?
Ms. Travnicek. So, absolutely. I mean, we do have the State
agencies in place that do have regulatory responsibilities,
from the Department of Environmental Quality to the Department
of Water Resources, we have the expertise. We are looking to
also make sure that we have got good quality water, good water
quantity. So, we look at those expertise. So, yes. So, we want
to make sure--that is why we are always stressing the States'
rights, making sure that you are utilizing our expertise. We
are the ones that are boots on the ground, so, working with us.
Mr. Burlison. They are the ones that actually live there
and know the area, and I think all politics is local.
OK. Next question is for Mr. Farris. What challenges are
the manufacturers in the United States facing due to the
current permitting process?
Mr. Farris. We are facing delays. What we have decided in
this country, we need to build more semiconductors. We need to
build more batteries. And that process right now is 4\1/2\
years to create an environmental impact statement. We need to
build these yesterday. So, we are seeing massive delays
throughout the permitting process. And we are seeing agencies
that don't talk to each other. We are seeing informal paperwork
being delayed that should take no more than 90 days, sir.
Mr. Burlison. And so, this is a no-brainer, but that
affects your association's ability to create jobs?
Mr. Farris. That affects every one of our members'
abilities to create jobs and improve the local communities in
which they operate.
Mr. Burlison. What about energy projects, including
renewable energy sources? What are the potential consequences
of delays there, or what is happening with those?
Mr. Farris. To be able to get many of these renewable
energy sources on board, we need transmission lines. We need to
be able to take that power where it is produced and take it to
where we need it. Transmission lines can take 15 years to
permit. So, if we bring on a new solar facility or a new
hydrogen facility, you still need the transmission lines. And
even within itself, a hydrogen facility takes 4\1/2\ years for
the environmental impact statement, takes a year to build and
operate. Four and a half years for that, plus another 15 for
transmission lines, and that shows you the type of problem we
have here.
Mr. Burlison. And with transmission lines, you have to
acquire the land, which takes time.
Mr. Farris. It does. It does.
Mr. Burlison. And so, at a time when we have more critical
needs than ever and we need to be mining and harvesting
everything that we can here in the United States, how can we
improve the regulations within the Clean Water Act?
Mr. Farris. What we need is enforceable deadlines. If there
is judicial review, it needs to be meaningful and timely.
Deadlines will go a long way, as well as One Federal Decision.
Make sure that one agency is in charge, everyone answers to
that one agency, and so, they coordinate with everyone else
involved. They get the informal paperwork from the other
agencies. So, those two aspects will take us a lot of the way
there.
Mr. Burlison. Thank you, Mr. Farris.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. James, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. James. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First of all, I want to thank all the witnesses who are
here with us today and graciously devoting your time to be here
and in your everyday life to improve water quality for all
Americans in your neck of the woods. Your expertise is not only
valuable, but it also informs us about the real world
implications of the Clean Water Act.
In Michigan's 10th Congressional District, I represent a
district that is not only diverse in its people, but one that
is blessed with the rich, natural resources from Lake St. Clair
to the Great Lakes. Michigan's natural beauty is second to
none, which is why I lead off by asking the question. We have
to be able to take care of everyone. Clean water is something
that is important for all humankind, especially when
communities are struggling financially.
We talk about these communities being impacted by the Clean
Water Act over the years. I would appreciate getting feedback
from the panel on the unique challenges that we are still using
to manage combined sewer overflows, the storm sewer separation.
Some of the best practices that you have either deployed or
seen, and also with the storm sewer separation with what we are
putting back into our rivers and to our lakes to improve that.
Also, some of the technologies that you have seen across the
country and across the world that puts water back into our
estuaries, aquifers, rivers, lakes, cleaner than we found it.
Ladies first, please.
Ms. Travnicek. Yes, Representative. So, the agency that I
am working with, we don't get into the storm sewer as much as
some of the other ones might. But as you are looking at
equitable infrastructure and trying to make sure that you are
capturing the water quality aspect, whether it is trying to
make sure that, yes, we are protecting some of those waters,
but also at the same time looking at water reuse. So, how do we
put that into other uses as well.
But my biggest thing as you are looking at the
infrastructure is tying back to the permits, so, the costs that
go with it would be the biggest thing on my end, looking for
those inconsistencies, making sure that we are streamlining,
because that is going into your costs as you are looking at
that infrastructure that you are looking for, because that is
also adding to it. So, that is what I would add.
Thank you.
Mr. James. Thank you.
Yes, please.
Ms. McIlwain. OK. I am sorry. Can you repeat the last piece
of your question?
Mr. James. So, two-part. One, if you have any experience
with storm sewer separation, those combined sewer overflows
which are contributing in many cases to the algal blooms that
you mentioned in your opening statement, and also linked by
other bacterial growth, that storm sewer separation, if you
have seen instances in your experiences of where that has been
done better.
You mentioned the Chesapeake Bay. If you have some
experience in some of that separation, and also in the region.
Just as a hint, North Carolina, I understand, did some--I
understand Maryland is completely separate--but just on the
Atlantic Coast, North Carolina experienced some success with
using technology to clean the Cape Fear water to clean out
things like PFAS.
Can you speak on that, Madam Secretary, anything of those
modern technologies that can help us put water back cleaner?
Ms. McIlwain. Yes. Well, for one, we need to continue to
increase hydraulic capacity in infrastructure. The Back River
that we deal with a lot is the wastewater treatment. It has a
headworks program that captures a flow, and it reduces basement
backups that you talked about in sewages and those kinds of
things. So, we are using technologies. We have used a lot of
funding in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to upgrade the
wastewater treatment plants and to deal with those issues. And
we just passed legislation for potable use as well, so--potable
reuse.
Mr. James. Thank you, Madam Secretary.
Gentlemen, in the last minute that we have, can you speak
specifically, any tactics, techniques, procedures, any best
practices you have seen in addressing specifically, or what the
Federal Government could do to address lower income
communities, communities that are in economic distress, the
areas that the Federal Government can help with clean water in
those areas?
Mr. Conway. Speaking on behalf of NACWA, there are a
number--especially in the combined system areas--there are a
number of projects that are being completed, to certain stages
of completion, long-term control plants. Funding is critical
for those to be successful. Obviously, costs in the last year
have skyrocketed, so, estimates of cost for a project in the
next 5 years were $1 billion; now we are finding it is $2
billion. So, any increase in funding. Because those projects
are modern technologies being employed. They are increasing
capacity. They are using AI. They are allowing those rivers and
streams that get those discharges to be a lot cleaner. So, it
is just strictly a funding equation there.
Mr. James. Thank you, Mr. Conway.
Mr. Farris, we will reach out offline.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Williams, 5 minutes.
Mr. Williams of New York. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Glad to
be here.
Mr. Farris, specifically in my district, recently, a large
chip manufacturer has announced a significant, extremely
significant, historic investment. And one of the deciding
factors was the availability of water. And clearly, that is
used in a lot of manufacturing processes that I am familiar
with, and a little bit familiar with some of the testing and
treatment of wastewaters.
As a regards to your organizations that you work with,
manufacturers, how would you compare the discharge of the
quality of water, the cleanness of water discharged from your
facilities today than, say, 50 years ago? What has happened in
the last 50 years in terms of water quality and water standards
in manufacturing?
Mr. Farris. In manufacturing, over the last 50 years, we
have improved, I believe, it is around 80 percent. We are
amongst the cleanest in the world. I can get you--I will find--
I can get you that accurate number, but I believe it is around
80 percent amongst the cleanest in the world.
Mr. Williams of New York. And 80 percent in what metrics?
Would you generally--what are pollutants that are concerned
about? These are chemicals, metals, turbidity, what are some of
the things?
Mr. Farris. Absolutely. All of the above. Anything that is
regulated and discharged into the waterways, we are about 80
percent better than we were 50 years ago. And constantly
improving. Manufacturers are constantly innovating and finding
new ways to be able to be a good environmental steward of the
environment they work in.
Mr. Williams of New York. I understand that a lot of
manufacturing also recycles a lot of its water to reduce its
waste stream. Do you have any specific examples or context that
you can give our committee about how manufacturing stewards its
resource of water, particularly in consuming less and
discharging it cleaner, as has been the practice?
Mr. Farris. We can follow up with you directly on some more
detailed stories, but I can say that manufacturers are
constantly innovating, and recycling water is one of those
pieces. We are constantly working to improve the environment
around us. But we will follow up with you directly with some
more stories.
Mr. Williams of New York. Great. Thank you. Does your
organization also cover the aggregate industry?
Mr. Farris. Yes. So, we have 14,000 members. We represent
everything from the five-person manufacturing facility all the
way up to some of the biggest across all sectors.
Mr. Williams of New York. So, in my district, we have not
only this historic potentially $100 billion investment in
manufacturing and the supporting infrastructure around it, we
also have a major overhaul of I-81 running right through the
middle of Syracuse, obviously a very significant construction
project.
Can you describe the role that aggregate plays? What is
aggregate? What is it used for?
Mr. Farris. I would say it is--I would defer to you, sir.
Mr. Williams of New York. OK. It is sand and gravel,
basically, used as different compounds and building blocks,
specifically in concrete. And it adds strength and durability.
And there are no streets, there are no buildings, there are no
sidewalks, there are no parking lots, there are no dams without
concrete. And one of the key ingredients is what is commonly
called aggregates, which is all different sizes. Think of it as
different size stones and different size sand, all that make up
the physical structure of concrete, as has been the case for
over 2,000 years, right. The Romans first started using that,
and many of their monuments still stand.
But when we are making this tradeoff in terms of clean
water, I understand that the mining industry also is subject to
very strict water rules and water discharge rules, particularly
around something known as TCLP, which maybe you are familiar
with in terms of heavy metals.
Can you describe how your organization, I don't know, leans
into these testing and water quality standards, and how is it
important that these are very clear standards for you to adhere
to, for your clients to adhere to?
Mr. Farris. So, what we do is we work with manufacturers,
we work on best practices, and we often work with EPA or other
regulatory bodies to make sure that these standards are
technically achievable and technically feasible. They are very
important for our members because all of our members ask for
regulatory certainty. So, we need to make sure that our members
understand them and are able to meet them.
Mr. Williams of New York. Great. Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman's time has expired.
Garret Graves, 5 minutes.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr.
Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing. Ranking Member
Napolitano, nice to see you as well.
Dr. Travnicek, I understand you have got some experience
with 404 permits. We have more than our share of wetlands in
Louisiana as well. In the IIJA, there was about $160 million
provided for the Corps of Engineers for regulatory, which is
about 50 percent of their budget. I am not sure that I have
seen any improvements in their 404 process, and I am just
curious if you have seen anything in North Dakota. And as I
remember North Dakota, I got to tell you, thank you for sending
Kelly Armstrong. Huge fan. He has been fantastic.
Ms. Travnicek. Yes, we are very fortunate to have his
leadership in the State.
So, as it relates to what we are seeing in North Dakota
with the Army Corps of Engineers and the 404 permitting, we
haven't seen anything that has sped up any of the processes. I
think we are still seeing those delays in timelines. And if
this were to go into place, right, that is why we are nervous
about that. I mean, even with the other permits that I have to
get through the Army Corps of Engineers for the water
infrastructure projects, we don't know when we will get them
sometimes. We try to make sure that we are trying to pin them
down on a timeline, but sometimes that gets passed. So, we
haven't seen anything that has been able to turn that around
quickly.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. And I think that there are some
mitigation banks that have been in the process for 10 years
now, which, of course, causes some additional problems.
Secretary McIlwain, thanks for being here. I was looking at
the Maryland OneStop program, where you have an electronic
regulatory process. And I didn't know if you could provide any
background. We have actually been looking at an electronic NEPA
for the Federal process as a way to try and help with
compliance and better transparency. I just didn't know if you
had any wisdom or insight to share in regard to your Maryland
OneStop process for permitting, if there are any lessons
learned there for helping to just improve efficiency.
Ms. McIlwain. Oh, I could only speak in general terms about
increasing efficiency. That is something that I brought to
every agency I have been at. I would have to look into--I can
provide that to you later, but I don't have any direct
knowledge of that.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Sure. Secretary, maybe I
misunderstood, but I thought you all had--Maryland OneStop was
kind of a one-stop electronic permitting process that you all
had. And again, we are trying to figure out at the Federal
level what we can do to help expedite the permitting at the
Federal level and, again, better transparency as well. And so,
if you all do have any lessons learned, it would be great, love
to hear it. If not, no problem. No need to follow up.
But a quick followup for you maybe. So, the reality is,
when you look across infrastructure projects across the United
States, the majority of those projects actually don't require a
NEPA analysis, a National Environmental Policy Act analysis,
because the only cases when NEPA is triggered is when you
impact certain Federal resources. It could be dollars. It could
be Federal natural resources. It could be Federal permits. And
so, most projects don't trigger that because they are using
local funds, State funds, or private funds, and so, it doesn't
trigger NEPA. But I know in Maryland, you all care about the
environment like we do in Louisiana.
So, I am just curious if you could share any insight to
your State laws that help to ensure protection of the
environment for projects that are built that may not trigger
Federal permits or Federal regulatory implications.
Ms. McIlwain. Well, we monitor--we have comprehensive
wetland laws. And back to what you were referring to with the
OneStop permit, that doesn't--if I understand your question,
that doesn't apply to all the permits that we have. We have a
general construction permit. And so, it just depends on what
kind of permit that you are talking about.
Yes. But in terms of permitting and NPDES permits, we look
at the laws. And we have State reviews and environmental
reviews and--just like NEPA, so, we definitely take a
comprehensive look at permits.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. And obviously, protection of the
environment, even if there is a project that doesn't trigger
Federal regulatory, your State process would ensure that you do
consider protection of the environment as well?
Ms. McIlwain. Of course.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Yes. OK, OK. Great. Thank you.
So, I want to go back. There was a gentlelady who a little
while ago made comments about the debt ceiling legislation and
suggested, Mr. Chairman, that the debt ceiling legislation
would actually cause more problems, would delay permitting and
things like that. And I just wanted to be clear on the record
that those comments fundamentally misrepresented what was in
that legislation.
That legislation actually helps to focus the NEPA process
on the environment rather than all of these other ancillary
things, and in doing so, you actually would expedite
permitting, expedite the NEPA process. It puts in a timeline of
2 years for an environmental impact statement, 1 year for an
environmental assessment.
I want to make note, when Jimmy Carter was President, you
had 1 year under his regulatory guidance to get through the
NEPA process. We have allowed for 2 years under an
environmental impact statement.
And so, while I certainly appreciate the gentlelady's
concerns about regulatory, I did want to make note that those
comments did significantly misrepresent the legislation known
as the BUILDER Act that passed this part of H.R. 1 earlier this
year.
Mr. Chairman, I have a question. I know that there is
additional information that folks would like to get from our
expert witnesses today. Is it possible that we have a second
round of questions?
Mr. Ezell [presiding]. Yes. Yes, we are going to have a
second round.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Fantabulous. I yield back, and I
will wait for a second round.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
Anybody have any other questions?
Mr. Graves, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Hey, look at that. Thank you very
much.
I am curious. One of the biggest challenges we have with
permitting is regulatory certainty. You have folks that have
resources or investment dollars that are trying to be invested
and move projects forward. It was noted by Dr. Travnicek that,
in many cases, your permitting is a black box or a black hole
where you don't have any idea on permitting certainty.
Mr. Farris, I am curious, as of September 2021, there were
about 300 permits in the EPA backlogged for reissuance,
affecting about 14,000 facilities nationwide. We did pass
legislation under H.R. 1 that would extend administrative
contingencies on EPA for 402 authority. Can you talk a little
bit about concerns on what you are seeing right now with Clean
Water Act compliance and just delays or uncertainty regarding
timelines for multiple permits and how NAM may be looking at
this?
Mr. Farris. Absolutely. Thank you. And thank you for your
leadership on H.R. 1. The NAM was happy support that and make
some meaningful changes.
What we are seeing on the Clean Water Act is the same thing
we are seeing up and down the board on permitting. We are
seeing delays, and we are seeing uncertainty, regulatory
uncertainty, which causes investment decisions to be made
elsewhere.
We have one member who was working through the 402
permitting process. They make raw materials that are critical
for semiconductors, for lithium-ion batteries, for electric
vehicles, for hydrogen, and they wanted to be able to build
that facility in the U.S. Because of the uncertainty
surrounding the so-called NPDES permits, the discharge permits,
they were not able to do that in a certain amount of time, and
so, they ended up building that facility in the EU that makes
raw materials for clean hydrogen.
We are seeing that up and down the board, is when our
manufacturers have to make investment decisions, they need to
be able to make it in a timely manner. And when they start
looking at the environmental impact statements that take on
average 4\1/2\ years, then they may start to look elsewhere
when they make those investment decisions.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. So, Mr. Farris, let me see if I
can make sure I am understanding what you are saying. So,
companies are going to build their projects, but if we have
regulatory uncertainty or if we have delays or if we have
repeated rejections, or as I have seen, repeated hurdles thrown
up, then what these investors or companies are going to do is
they are still going to build the project, they are just going
to build it elsewhere.
And you noted an EU example, but I am going to guess that
there are probably companies that have taken investment
decisions to Mexico, Brazil, India, China, and other countries
that don't have the same environmental conscience that we do in
the United States. Therefore, if you are concerned about the
global environment, then our delays or our lack of regulatory
certainty actually is resulting in a net loss for the global
environment. Is that fair?
Mr. Farris. One hundred percent. When you build in America,
we have amongst the cleanest manufacturing in the world. When
you build elsewhere, you don't have to meet those same
standards. You mentioned China. That is a perfect example of
not having to meet the same standards we have here. And many of
our members are global members, so, they are going to build
these facilities to meet this demand.
Semiconductors are being made everywhere. We want to make
them in the U.S. If we take a critical raw material and take it
overseas, we are just defecting where our issues in the supply
chain are.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Got it. Got it.
So, I am curious, Mr. Conway, Mr. Farris, have either of
you all seen any changes? I noted $160 million provided to the
Corps of Engineers for regulatory under the IIJA. As I recall,
there was $1 billion for regulatory agencies across the board
provided for compliance. Have either of you seen any
improvements or efficiency with those additional funds to the
agencies?
Mr. Conway. Not yet. I would assume that some of those
funds are still being distributed. It takes time to hire,
especially these days. It is hard to get people moving into
positions and onboarded and trained. So, we expect at the local
level at least to have some relief on regulatory issues.
Because in Colorado, we deal with our State for permitting as
opposed to the Federal Government on permitting projects. We
are more focused on State dollars there. So, we haven't seen--
--
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. Mr. Conway, do you
have any feedback on an electronic permitting system if you
think that would be something that is helpful?
Mr. Conway. I am not familiar with Maryland's system, but
any improvements that would add to efficiencies to speed time,
I would be in favor of.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Mr. Farris, any reaction to that?
Mr. Farris. Completely agree. Anything that can give our
manufacturers more certainty and a speedier process, we are in
favor of.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Secretary McIlwain, Maryland has a
law similar to Louisiana where they allow for performance-based
contracting on environmental restoration or ecological
restoration. I don't want to put you on the spot, but if you
don't mind, I would be curious if you could provide the
committee with some information on how that has worked, if it
has been a benefit to the State of Maryland as you all have
practiced that.
Ms. McIlwain. I think you are referring to pay-for-success
programs that we have. They have been very beneficial. And it
works, because what we do is allow those contracts to perform,
and then when it does what it says it is going to do, then we
pay. And then we use it also as a benchmark going forward. So,
we learned from those projects as well.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Great. Thank you. I want to thank
you all very much.
Madam Ranking Member, if you don't recognize this, this is
called filibustering, because I was trying to buy time for
somebody to get here, but apparently I failed. That is all I
can think of. In any case, it was nice seeing you all.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you all very much. I appreciate it.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you. Are you sure the gentleman yields
back?
Are there any further questions from any members of the
subcommittee who have not been recognized?
Seeing none, that concludes our hearing for today. I would
like to thank each and every one of you witnesses for your
testimony.
One moment, please.
I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing
remain open until such time as our witnesses have provided
answers to any questions that may be submitted to them in
writing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 days for any additional comments and information
submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in the record
of today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
The subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Question from Hon. David Rouzer to Andrea J. Travnicek, Ph.D.,
Director, North Dakota Department of Water Resources

Question 1. Can you describe the importance of Nationwide Permits
(NWPs), including NWP 12, for states such as North Dakota?
Answer. A Nationwide Permit (NWP) is a federally \1\ issued permit
allowing activities in waters of the United States without going
through the lengthy individual permit process. The activities permitted
have minimal individual or cumulative harmful impacts to the
environment. Examples of the types of activities allowed under discrete
NWPs are pipelines, utility lines, road crossings, and culverts. NWPs
allow certainty both for development and for the environment without
going through the lengthy process of acquiring an individual permit. In
a state with a limited construction season, a NWP can mean the
difference of a full year. To an oil producing state like North Dakota,
NWP 12 is of particular importance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Clean Water Act, Section 404(e).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upon a preconstruction notification to the US Corps of Engineers
District Engineer, NWP 12 allows for construction, maintenance, repair,
and removal of oil and natural gas pipelines, provided the activity
does not result in the loss of greater than \1/2\-acre of waters of the
United States for each single and complete project. North Dakota has
56,679.64 miles of rivers and streams, most of which are in our oil
producing counties (see Figure 1), 295 lakes and reservoirs \2\
(715,946.13 acres), and more than 1,000,000 wetlands \3\ (3,206,820
acres) with densities of more than 150\3\ per square mile in some
areas. The ability to permit activities in waters with minimal impacts
and know with relative certainty that the activities will have
acceptable impacts to the water and environment is beneficial to both
industry and the public. The industry benefits because the expectations
are well defined. The public benefits because the environment is
protected without undue expenditures, which can result in higher energy
costs for the consumer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While the NWP is an excellent tool, it is not without deficiencies.
In North Dakota, NWP 12 is denied Section 401 Clean Water Certification
in select waters as the ``one size fits all'' general conditions do not
provide reasonable assurance that North Dakota Administrative Code ch.
33.1-16-02.1, Standards of Quality for Waters of the State, is
supported as intended by the North Dakota Century Code Sec.  61-28-04.
This is easily remedied by including state specific regional conditions
that address the unique geology and environment of North Dakota, as
well the unique issues associated with the types of materials carried
in the oil and natural gas pipelines.

Questions from Hon. Grace F. Napolitano to Andrea J. Travnicek, Ph.D.,
Director, North Dakota Department of Water Resources

Question 1. What would be the consequence in the State of North
Dakota of H.R. 2811, the House Republican proposal to eliminate roughly
one-quarter of the annual investments in addressing the nation's water
infrastructure challenge?
Answer. Any funding is greatly appreciated and would be put to good
use for projects that benefit the citizens of North Dakota. A reduction
in funding may slow up the implementation rate of construction
projects. The difference due to a reduction in federal resources may
result in a shift of burden to rate payers but other federal, state,
and local programs may be able to make up for the funds depending on
the outcome. However, this impact does not impact as much as the 50%
reduction in funding that has hit the base State Revolving Loan Fund
Programs over the last two years because of the resumption of
congressional earmarks.

Question 2. What would be the impact to ratepayers and average
American families in North Dakota if they had to make up the difference
for the cuts in clean water infrastructure spending proposed in H.R.
2811?
Answer. Any funding is greatly appreciated and would be put to good
use for projects that benefit the citizens of North Dakota. A reduction
in funding may slow up the implementation rate of construction
projects. The difference due to a reduction in federal resources may
result in a shift of burden to rate payers but other federal, state,
and local programs may be able to make up for the funds depending on
the outcome. However, this impact does not impact as much as the 50%
reduction in funding that has hit the base State Revolving Loan Fund
Programs over the last two years because of the resumption of
congressional earmarks.

Question 3. If the plan contained in H.R. 2811 to cut one-quarter
of the funds provided to states to implement their responsibilities
under the Clean Water Act were realized, what would the consequences be
for your state in terms of water quality protections and the timeliness
of state actions to protect North Dakota waters? How would your state
make up the difference in clean water funds forgone by enactment of
H.R. 2811, or would this work simply not be carried out?
Answer. The State has not yet evaluated the impact of cuts to
project funding on the ability to implement those programs. If the
State is unable to replace those funds through other means, it may be
necessary to limit the number of initiated projects to those that are
most critical to protect public and environmental health in the state.
This reinforces the need to focus on federal agency core functions
essential to protecting public health.

Question 4. How has the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)
investment in wastewater infrastructure helped your state advance the
public, economic, and environmental health benefits?
Answer. Any funding is greatly appreciated and would be put to good
use for projects that benefit the citizens of North Dakota. This
funding will allow us to complete essential projects that would have
otherwise needed to wait years to be funded. In a time when water and
wastewater infrastructure assets are at, or are exceeding their useful
life, this has become an increasingly difficult challenge for utilities
of all sizes across the country. Unfortunately, the slow rollout of
guidance and funding by EPA, current construction sector inflation
outpacing general inflation, lack of BABA compliant construction
materials, and a reduction in the number of qualified bidders resulting
in higher project costs have impacted project developments and timely
completions. Additionally, the BIL funding overshadows that the State
Revolving Loan Fund Program base funding has been cut by almost 50%
over the last 2 years due to the reintroduction of congressional
earmarks. This reduction in the base program in the long run will limit
what can be achieved by the State Revolving Loan Fund Programs.

Questions from Hon. David Rouzer to Hon. Serena Coleman McIlwain,
Secretary, Maryland Department of the Environment

Question 1. The EPA recently entered into a settlement agreement
with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and several states, including
Maryland, to increase compliance activities, specifically on the state
of Pennsylvania. This means that Pennsylvania farmers will begin
experiencing new on-farm inspections, new enforcement actions, and new
permitting costs and requirements. Further, the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) has indicated that some farm operations in
Pennsylvania may be regulated, for the first time ever, as point
sources under the Clean Water Act. If farmers and landowners are
already incorporating conservation practices on their land and making
improvements to water quality, please explain whether the level of
enforcement is appropriate or whether it has far-reaching implications.
Answer. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and
Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) have worked collaboratively
for many years to ensure compliance among Maryland's Concentrated
Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), as well as provide technical and
financial assistance to those farms for adopting conservation
practices. The oversight and transparency for permitted CAFOs was a
challenge at first, but has become more routine as the process has
matured. The agricultural sector in our state is well versed in dealing
with regulations and permits, and we welcome the consistency between
farmers and landowners in Pennsylvania to further contribute to
improving local water quality the way Maryland's farmers and landowners
have been doing for a number of years. The role of EPA, as a 3rd party,
should benefit Pennsylvania to also assess how farmers and landowners
are already incorporating conservation practices on their land.

Question 2. The 2025 Chesapeake Bay targets were never realistic
but the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and some states, including Maryland,
continued to press for it in recent years. EPA Administrator Michael
Regan said publicly at a House Agriculture hearing on April 19, 2023,
that the states will not meet the 2025 deadline and that the agency
needs to reassess its goals. In your view, what is a practical
timeframe for states, including Pennsylvania, to reasonably meet the
pollution reductions in their state WIPs?
Answer. Maryland can only answer for the work it does and we do not
have the information needed to estimate other jurisdictions' abilities
to meet their WIP goals for 2025. We believe that Maryland's level of
restoration and implementation will be very close to meeting our 2025
WIP nutrient reduction goals for nitrogen and phosphorus that were
established before the partnership's decision to move additional loads
identified in the most recent model update to beyond 2025. We're
meeting our sediment targets already. If our reduction trends hold
steady, and we do not meet our targets in 2025, then it should only be
a few more years worth of implementation for our State to reach our WIP
goals.

Question 3. With the Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) reduction
being less than two years away, please explain the Maryland Department
of Environment's plans to reach the final goals and what, if anything,
the Department intends to ask the agricultural producers in Maryland to
do to ensure final goals are met.
Answer. As of 2018, MDE managed Bay Restoration Fund (BRF) upgrades
to Maryland's 67 major wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to the
highest levels of treatment technology have been fully obligated. As of
September 2022, 65 upgrades of significant municipal plants were
completed, with one under construction, and one in the planning phase.
Minor WWTPs (less than 0.5 million gallons per day) are also being
upgraded using the BRF on a voluntary basis, and when the upgrade is
cost-effective. As of September 2023, 12 upgraded minors were in
operation, six were in construction, and 17 were in design or planning
stages.
With the substantial investments in advanced treatment systems at
its municipal wastewater plants, the state is now considering ways to
ensure that plants will fully utilize these technologies. The state has
developed several performance incentive programs, such as the
Wastewater Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Grant through the BRF, to
ensure that the wastewater sector surpasses the statewide annual
average operational goal, established in the Phase III WIP, of 3.25
milligrams of nitrogen per liter in plant effluent. A statewide annual
average concentration of 2.85 milligrams of nitrogen per liter is
required to meet the additional nutrient load reductions needed to
address 2025 climate change conditions, as explained in the climate
change addendum to Maryland's Phase III WIP.
Regarding pollution from septic or on-site waste systems, two of
the most significant direct benefits, apart from nitrogen reductions,
are public health and groundwater protection. Toward this end, the
state agencies are pursuing ``high-benefit'' reductions in places with
impacts to public health and drinking water quality. Additional
strategies include accelerating the pace of septic connections to
sewers in high-benefit areas to take advantage of the significant
investments Maryland has made in treatment at Maryland's WWTPs.
For stormwater, over 80% of impervious surfaces in Maryland are
covered under stormwater National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permits. The Maryland Department of the Environment
(MDE) has reissued NPDES Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4)
Permits for the regulated Phase I large and medium jurisdictions and
will be reissuing the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)
State Highway Administration's (SHA) permit. So far for each permit
cycle, the required retrofits that reduce nutrient pollution from
historical impervious areas achieve anywhere from 10-20% of total
needed restoration. MDE is looking for ways to increase the impact of
this implementation by seeking practices that offer multiple co-
benefits.
MDE's only direct association with agriculture is through the
issuance, inspection, and enforcement of permits for CAFO stormwater.
The Maryland Department of Agriculture is the responsible entity for
determining what restoration / conservation practices could be
implemented within that sector. However, if the agricultural sector
part of our Chesapeake Bay Watershed Implementation Plan is implemented
as written, the state will achieve its 2025 pollution reduction
targets. If this goal is not met in 2025, the State would ask the
agricultural producers to continue committing to the plan they helped
put together for their sector.

Question 4. Does the Maryland Department of Environment intend to
force retirements to achieve higher levels of nutrient reductions to
meet the 2025 goals?
Answer. It is unclear from this question what specifically is meant
by retirements. If this is referring to retiring productive
agricultural land, MDE does not purchase and retire land. Any
retirement of productive agricultural land to either forest, wetlands,
solar, or other land type of land use is the decision of the landowner.
MDE does not maintain control of State owned lands that lease to
agricultural producers, so MDE cannot retire those acres either.

Questions from Hon. Grace F. Napolitano to Hon. Serena Coleman
McIlwain, Secretary, Maryland Department of the Environment

Question 1. What would be the consequence in your state of H.R.
2811, the House Republican proposal to eliminate roughly one-quarter of
the annual investments in addressing the nation's water infrastructure
challenge?
Answer. For Maryland, a 23% cut to BIL funding would result in more
than a $100M reduction in funding for projects to clean up the
Chesapeake Bay, remove toxic lead service lines, eliminate PFAS in
drinking water, and replace Maryland's aging infrastructure. It would
also mean more than $50M less in loan forgiveness for our economically
disadvantaged and environmentally overburdened communities. We already
know from our Clean Water and Drinking Water Needs Surveys that we as a
nation have underinvested in our water infrastructure and we also on an
annual basis receive many more funding proposals than we have funding
to support. BIL funds represent a once-in-a-generation investment in
our water infrastructure and any cuts to this historic funding threaten
further degradation of the nation's water infrastructure.
Sub-points:

The investments are unprecedented and have the ability to
reshape the nation. This investment goes a long way toward bridging the
infrastructure gap, but a gap still remains meaning our thinking should
be about doing more, not less.

Disinvesting in infrastructure funding would be
devastating with potential negative effects on communities that have
suffered from long-standing environmental injustices.

This money is critical for aging water and wastewater
infrastructure.

States, tribes and local governments would likely
struggle to reduce the number of lead service lines in older cities,
effectively deal with PFAS contamination in drinking water and fish,
and increase resiliency to extreme weather events.

We have almost 60 community water systems in Maryland
with PFAS contamination and about a third of the systems are in
disadvantaged communities.

Question 2. What would be the impact to ratepayers and average
American families if they had to make up the difference for the cuts in
clean water infrastructure spending proposed in H.R. 2811?
Answer. The impact of these proposed cuts on ratepayers and average
American families would be very negative. BIL funding ensures that
water projects are affordable for our communities, particularly those
communities and families with lower incomes. Cuts to this funding will
mean higher rates for our ratepayers and further inflationary pressure.
Worse, for our water infrastructure, families, and economy is if
communities put off investing in their water infrastructure projects as
a result of cuts to BIL funding--this is a very real possibility. It is
also possible that such disinvestment will spur short-sighted cost-
containment measures, like switching water supply sources that can have
severe public health consequences akin to the Flint, Michigan, lead
crisis.

Question 3. If the plan contained in H.R. 2811 to cut one-quarter
of the funds provided to states to implement their responsibilities
under the Clean Water Act were realized, what would the consequences be
for your state in terms of water quality protections and the timeliness
of state actions to protect Maryland waters?
Answer. Today, Federal funds are currently insufficient to cover
CWA programs run by the state and therefore state special (fees) and
general funds are used to cover the additional costs.
The impact could be a decrease in compliance inspections leading to
a decrease in enforcement, a critical part of the CWA. Permit turn-
around times would likely decrease with the potential to slow the
economy, including infrastructure construction projects.
As a downstream state, one of our concerns is the impacts if funds
were cut to upstream states for pollution reduction projects. Recent
monitoring information indicates progress in reducing these pollutants
to the Chesapeake Bay. If less protection and restoration occur in
upstream areas, we are concerned that this progress could be hindered
or even reversed. Furthermore, even if the necessary protection and
restoration are afforded in Maryland, other states with waters
connected to Maryland's non-tidal waters and/or Chesapeake Bay could
fall short in meeting their pollution abatement funding needs. Maryland
does not want to see its substantial investment in restoration of the
Chesapeake Bay to be undermined by the federal government cutting funds
provided to states to implement their Clean Water Act responsibilities.

Question 4. How has the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)
investment helped your state advance the public, economic, and
environmental health benefits that can be achieved by cleanup of the
Chesapeake Bay?
Answer. Maryland's State Revolving Fund (SRF) programs are
receiving more than $750M in additional funding over five years through
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This funding will enable Maryland to
fund dozens of additional projects annually, including critical
projects to clean up the Chesapeake Bay, remove toxic lead service
lines, eliminate PFAS in drinking water, and replace Maryland's aging
water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure. The BIL funding
includes increased levels of additional subsidy, which will allow
Maryland to provide loan forgiveness to our economically disadvantaged
and environmentally overburdened communities. Without this critical
federal investment in our infrastructure we would not have the funding
we need to tackle these longstanding environmental and public health
challenges.
Also, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) of 2021
authorized $238 million for the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program Office
(CBPO) for federal fiscal years 2022-2026.

The CBPO receives approximately $47.6 million per year.

In FY22 and 23, CBPO allocated over $5.2 million in IIJA
funding awarded to the State of Maryland for use in most effective
basins (MEBs). MEBs are tributaries to the bay that have the greatest
impact on water quality.

In FY23, EPA also provided over $1.07 million in IIJA
funding for MD in the form of supplemental funding grants and grants to
advance Chesapeake Bay Program partnership priorities such as enhancing
tree canopies.

Maryland also benefits from the remaining IIJA funds
which are being allocated to the Chesapeake small watershed and
innovative nutrient and sediment reduction grant programs; enhancing
water quality monitoring efforts; and funding research focused on water
quality and living resources.

Question 5. Since the beginning of the 118th Congress, House
Republicans have moved several bills to weaken Clean Water Act
authorities. What adverse impacts would occur in the State of Maryland
if some of these efforts to weaken water quality standards were
enacted?
Answer. It is not only about investments in restoration of degraded
ecosystems, the CWA serves as a critical tool to protect healthy
streams and rivers that flow into the Bay and provide sources of
drinking water. Maryland has beautiful cold water trout streams as well
as high quality streams with exceptional aquatic diversity. For
example, Maryland's small (first, second, and third order) streams
support more than 50 native fish species, ten native freshwater
mussels, eight native crayfishes, seven salamanders, and more than one
hundred genera of benthic macroinvertebrates. The Clean Water Act,
through the antidegradation requirements in the water quality standards
and implementation of Section 401 (state water quality certification)
affords these protections to waters of the United States. Congress
intended States to protect their waters from harm associated with the
operation of, and discharges from, federally permitted and licensed
facilities in Section 401. If an upstream state lacks independent
authority, the sole recourse for reviewing federally permitted
activities involving a discharge is through Section 401 certification.
Severely constraining State authority in the Section 401 review process
threatens to increase the risk that activities in upstream waters and
wetlands will threaten water quality in Maryland waters.
A State's water quality requirements help to ensure that
communities receive similar benefits from environmental protection
efforts. To undermine a state's authority in this manner runs in
opposition to environmental justice. Such limitations on a certifying
state's authority, prohibits protections of overburdened and
underserved communities

Question 6. Earlier this year, President Biden vetoed H.J. Res. 27,
a resolution to overturn the administration's efforts to clarify the
scope of Clean Water Act protections. If that resolution had been
enacted, what would have been the impact to the percent of waters and
wetlands protected by the Clean Water Act in the State of Maryland?
Answer. H.J. Res 27, the new WOTUS Rule published on January 18,
2023, and effective on March 20, 2023, is in effect in Maryland.
Maryland is not among the 27 states where the new 2023 Rule currently
is not in effect due to ongoing litigation. Maryland strongly supports
a science based definition for jurisdictional waters and their linkages
to chemical, physical and biological integrity of other waters. Most
waters and wetlands, including isolated wetlands, are regulated in
Maryland and no changes in state-level jurisdiction have occurred.
According to a 1:250,000 scale stream map there are at least 8,800
miles of non-tidal streams and rivers in Maryland. Based on this same
map, the vast majority (about 91%) of the total stream miles in
Maryland consist of small streams--with most (5,863 miles or 66%) of
the total consisting of the smallest mapped streams. Upstream waters
(ephemeral, intermittent, and small perennial streams) form essential
aquatic networks that act like capillaries that move all sorts of
physical and chemical compounds--including pollutants--downstream. The
conditions of all of the vital resources mentioned above, the success
of restoration and protection efforts, including Maryland regulations
for protecting resources and water quality, are strongly influenced by
the condition of upstream waters.
Continued progress in conservation efforts relies on sustained
protection of all upstream waters. Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts
may suffer if upstream states lack similar authority and at least
comparable standards to those of Maryland. Ensuring a federal
regulatory floor is critical to states such as Maryland. Having a
broader federal definition of Clean Water Act jurisdiction could help
avoid complex interstate conflicts that might otherwise arise if the
federal definition were too narrow or non-existent. It is important
that flowing waters that cross state borders be adequately protected
from pollution under the upstream state's law (with provisions for the
downstream state to weigh-in on discharge permits and standards) or, if
not, be subject to federal jurisdiction so that the downstream state
can, if need be, participate as a downstream state in the process of
the permitting of discharges and the establishing of water quality
standards for such waters. This could potentially be addressed through
regional interstate efforts and clear Section 401(a)(2) guidance.
Regionalized approaches are critical for implementation. Maryland
favors a scientifically defensible definition of waters and recognizes
that some waters (e.g. ephemeral streams and rivers) are more critical
in other parts of the country and thus may merit a different level of
scrutiny. We do believe that states and tribes, working with regional
offices of federal agencies, can identify the levels of review,
protection, and regulation, as well as the appropriate tools for
regional determinations.

Questions from Hon. Frederica S. Wilson to Hon. Serena Coleman
McIlwain, Secretary, Maryland Department of the Environment

Question 1. Secretary McIlwain, in your testimony, you spoke about
the need for an accountability system to ensure proper oversight for
pollution reduction and removal from water resources. What would a
sufficient accountability system look like?
Answer. By accountability system, I was referring to the critical
importance of having a robust compliance and enforcement framework. A
robust compliance and enforcement framework is a structured and
comprehensive system to ensure that laws, regulations, standards, and
policies are adhered to and violations are appropriately addressed.
Such a framework is essential for maintaining order, promoting
fairness, and protecting the rights and interests of stakeholders. Key
components of a robust compliance and enhancement framework include:

Clear Regulations and Standards: well-defined laws,
regulations, and standards. These rules must be clear, specific, and
easy to understand to minimize ambiguity and facilitate compliance.

Compliance Monitoring: continuous monitoring of
activities and behavior to ensure they align with established
regulations. This may involve data collection, audits, inspections, and
reporting mechanisms.

Education, Training, and compliance assistance: Those
subject to compliance regulations should receive proper education and
training to understand their responsibilities and how to comply with
the rules.

Deterrence and Incentives: implementing strategies to
deter potential violators while also providing incentives for
compliance, such as recognition or rewards for outstanding compliance
efforts.

Risk Assessment: Identify potential risks and prioritize
enforcement efforts based on the severity of violations and the
potential impact on stakeholders or the public.

Enforcement Authorities: Clearly define the roles,
responsibilities, and regulatory authorities.

Penalties and Sanctions: specific consequences for non-
compliance, including fines, penalties, legal actions, suspension, or
revocation of licenses or permits.

Transparency and Accountability: Ensure that the
enforcement process is transparent and accountable, with mechanisms for
appeals, hearings, and dispute resolution.

Data Management and Documentation: thorough records of
compliance activities, violations, and enforcement actions. Proper data
management is essential for tracking trends, conducting investigations,
and demonstrating accountability.

Continuous Improvement: periodic review and updating of
the compliance framework to adapt to changing circumstances, emerging
risks, and evolving regulations.

Resource Allocation: ensuring adequate resources
(financial, human, technological) are allocated to support compliance
monitoring and enforcement activities.

Ethical Considerations: incorporate ethical principles
and checks and balances into the framework to promote integrity,
fairness, and respect.

A robust compliance and enforcement framework should strike a
balance between promoting compliance through education and support and
deterring non-compliance through enforcement measures. It should also
be adaptable to changing circumstances and responsive to emerging
challenges. Ultimately, the goal is to foster a culture of compliance,
uphold the rule of law, and protect the interests of all stakeholders.

Question 2. Secretary McIlwain, as you said in your testimony,
cleaner water contributes to higher property value, and abundant
resources, and supports our economy. Could you elaborate on how clean
water fosters job and economic market prosperity?
Answer. It is very well known that water touches every aspect of
life. Clean water is a vital component of economic growth and household
welfare because it supports healthy ecosystems, and is essential and
fundamental for life itself. Our economy depends on clean water for
manufacturing, farming, tourism, recreation, energy production, and
other economic sectors that need clean water to function and flourish.
Clean water strengthens the State's fishing, tourism, and real estate
industries, generating economic and recreational benefits estimated at
billions of dollars each year.
The best example is the importance of having a restored and clean
Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay is an important tourist and
recreation attraction in the region. According to Pew \1\, countless
tourists visit its thousands of miles of shoreline, which generates
income and jobs for local residents of the area. Tourism and recreation
activities include boating, fishing, wildlife watching, and more. About
$2.03 billion in revenue and 32,025 jobs are generated each year in
Maryland due to its recreational boating industry, the Chesapeake Bay
Foundation quotes from an Economic Impact of Maryland Boating in a 2007
report. Additionally, eight million wildlife watchers spent $636
million, $960 million, and $1.4 billion in Maryland, Virginia, and
Pennsylvania, respectively, on trip-related expenses and equipment in
2006 (U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, and
U.S. Department of Commerce) (``The Economic Impact of the Bay'').
Striped bass alone result in $500 million in economic activity related
to fishing expenditures, travel, and lodging each year. In terms of
real estate, clean water can increase the value of a single family home
that is located 4,000 feet or closer to the shoreline by up to 25
percent (``The Economic Impact of the Bay''), so cleaning up the
Chesapeake Bay would help the economy in that way and many other ways.

Question 3. Secretary McIlwain, in Florida, we have Biscayne Bay in
my district, and numerous streams, rivers, lakes, and other water
sources throughout the state. Many of our cities are located downstream
and are heavily impacted by the actions of those in the upstream areas.
How does upstream pollution endanger the well-being of downstream
communities and economies?
Answer. As mentioned in the previous response, clean water is vital
to our health, communities, and economy. We need clean water upstream
to have healthy communities downstream. The health of rivers, lakes,
bays, and coastal waters depend on the streams and wetlands where they
begin. Streams and wetlands provide many benefits to communities by
trapping floodwaters, recharging groundwater supplies, filtering
pollution, and providing habitat for fish and wildlife.
Upstream waters (ephemeral, intermittent, and small perennial
streams) form essential aquatic networks acting like capillaries that
move all sorts of physical and chemical compounds--including
pollutants--downstream. The conditions of all of the vital water
resources, the success of restoration and protection efforts, including
Maryland regulations for protecting resources and water quality, are
strongly influenced by the condition of upstream waters. Continued
progress toward success in conservation efforts relies on sustained
protection of all upstream waters. Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts
may suffer if upstream states lack similar authority and at least
comparable standards to those of Maryland.

Question from Hon. Garret Graves to Hon. Serena Coleman McIlwain,
Secretary, Maryland Department of the Environment

Question 1. It is my understanding that the State of Maryland is
currently using performance contracting for ecological restoration
projects throughout the state. Could you please describe the benefits
of this particular contracting mechanism and why the state of Maryland
has embraced it?
Answer. Performance Contracting, or Pay for Success (also referred
to as pay for performance), is an innovative contracting approach that
connects payment to the delivery of quantified and verified outcomes.
The Pay for Success approach has many benefits. It leads to greater
innovation and efficiency in project delivery, as well as greater
certainty around project costs and outcomes. It also reduces upfront
costs to governments and leverages the use of private capital to
facilitate project delivery. It can transfer the costs for long-term
stewardship to the contractor by including ongoing payments that are
linked to the verification of sustained environmental outcomes. Pay for
Success contracts can be structured to incorporate a range of benefits,
including nutrient reductions, DEIJ, climate resilience, local job
creation/promotion, habitat creation and carbon sequestration.
Pay for Success contracts transfer much of the risk associated with
project delivery (such as cost overruns, change orders, supply chain
issues, etc.) onto the contractor by securing a unit delivery price at
the beginning of the contract. This locks in the price per unit the
government is willing to pay. Also, by paying for environmental
outcomes the risk of funding ineffective projects is reduced--if
outcomes are not delivered, then payments are reduced or eliminated.
Pay for Success programs can also lead to more streamlined
procurement processes, attracting additional contractors, engineers,
landowners, and investors. It can lead to rapid, large-scale
restoration by enabling the project design and implementation to be
handled by the contractor. Publishing the outcomes of Pay for Success
contracting creates transparency for the public taxpayer and
contractors and can serve to further drive down costs and promote
innovation in project delivery. However, the payment structure requires
either interim or long-term financing depending on the structure of the
contract, which can dissuade some contractors from bidding on a
project.
Maryland has experience using Pay for Success contracting in the
Clean Water Commerce Program (a state funded pay for success program
that pays for nitrogen reductions to restore the Chesapeake Bay), State
Revolving Fund Program (including the Prince George's County P3 Clean
Water Partnership Program), and Maryland State Highway Administration's
Full Delivery Stream Restoration procurement. A new State law--The
Conservation Finance Act--opens up additional opportunities for Pay for
Success contracting in Maryland.
Maryland is also engaging federal agencies like the Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE), to modernize existing registration and mapping tools
to better support pay for performance projects. For example,
modernizing and expanding the USACE Regulatory In lieu fee and Bank
Information Tracking System (RIBITS) to include carbon outcomes would
provide consistent tracking and accounting of quantified and verified
outcomes associated with ecosystem restoration in Maryland and across
the Chesapeake Bay region.

Questions from Hon. David Rouzer to Mickey Conway, Chief Executive
Officer, Metro Water Recovery, Denver, Colorado, on behalf of the
National Association of Clean Water Agencies

Question 1. How has the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
historically interpreted the Section 402(k) ``permit shield'' policy?
How would utilities be affected if this interpretation no longer
applied?
Answer. CWA Section 402(k)--the NPDES ``permit shield'' provision--
stipulates that compliance with an NPDES permit constitutes compliance
with the CWA itself. Under its longstanding ``permit shield'' policy,
EPA has interpreted section 402(k) to mean that, as long as a permittee
provides all necessary information throughout its application process,
the limits included in its final NPDES permit lay out the extent of the
permittee's obligations under the CWA. In other words, ``the burden
[is] on permit writers rather than permittees to search through the
applicable regulations and correctly apply them to a permittee through
its permit. This means that a permittee may rely on its permit to know
the extent of its enforceable duties.'' EPA, Consolidated Permit
Regulations, 45 Fed. Reg. 33290, 33312 (May 19, 1980).
In addition to reiterating that the onus is on permit writers to
place all necessary limits in a permit, EPA's ``permit shield'' policy
also clarifies that an NPDES permit authorizes the discharge of more
than just the specific pollutants listed in or limited by the permit.
Rather, an NPDES permit authorizes all of the following: (1) pollutants
specifically limited in the permit or which the permit, fact sheet, or
administrative record explicitly identify as controlled through
indicator parameters; (2) pollutants for which the permit authority has
not established limits or other permit conditions, but which are
specifically identified as present in facility discharges during the
permit application process; and (3) pollutants not identified as
present, but which are constituents of waste streams, operations, or
processes that were clearly identified during the permit application
process.'' This ensures that a permit writer does not need to list
every single pollutant that might be discharged for a discharge to be
considered ``lawful,'' and ensures that permit holders are not
subjected to unanticipated post-hoc enforcement efforts.
The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the purpose of the section
402(k) ``permit shield'' is to ``insulate permit holders from changes
in various regulations during the period of a permit and to relieve
permit holders of having to litigate the question of whether their
permits are sufficiently strict. In short, Section 402(k) serves the
purpose of giving permits finality.'' E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v.
Train, 430 U.S. 112 (1977). EPA's longstanding interpretation of
section 402(k) has been critical to ensuring that utilities are able to
avail themselves of this much needed finality by allowing utilities to
rely on their NPDES permits to know the extent of their CWA obligations
and to shield utilities from unwarranted post-hoc liability. This in
turn allows utilities to maintain, upgrade, and operate the nation's
critical stormwater and wastewater infrastructure in a manner that
allows for advanced planning and consideration of key factors such as
affordability and resiliency.

Question 2. In your testimony, you discuss the city of San
Francisco and litigation aimed at forcing EPA to remove ``cause or
contribute'' boilerplate language from one of its National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. Can you discuss how
reforms aimed at requiring permit writers to use terms that clearly
identify their specific pollutant(s) for compliance can help reduce
unnecessary litigation and provide large and small cities with more
regulatory certainty?
Answer. As EPA has long noted, ``despite commonly held beliefs,
water quality standards are not directly enforceable.'' Rather, under
the Clean Water Act, water quality standards get translated by permit
writers into enforceable limits--called effluent limitations--that are
designed to ensure that a permitted discharge does not violate the
water quality standards of the waterbody a permittee is discharging
into. EPA's permitting regulations and guidance lay out detailed
processes for how these water quality-based effluent limitations are
developed for the various types of pollutants a permittee may
discharge.
These water quality-based effluent limitations are supposed to
clearly identify what water quality standard(s) they are designed to
address, which pollutant(s) they apply to, and what, exactly, a permit
holder must do to be in compliance. This clarity not only helps ensure
that adequate protections for the receiving waterbody are in place, it
also provides utility permittees with the certainty needed to plan and
invest in major clean water infrastructure projects. Clean Water Act
compliance should not be either a hidden or a moving target--it should
be clearly spelled out in a utility's NPDES permit.
However, where permit writers instead use generic, boilerplate
``cause or contribute'' language that fails to provide guidance to
either permittees about what is expected of them or to permitting
authorities and citizens about what constitutes a violation of a water
quality standard, the careful permitting system Congress designed in
CWA Section 402 is turned on its head, and utility permittees are
subjected to unnecessary, after-the-fact litigation over what
``compliance'' actually means.
The threat of such litigation is antithetical to a city's ability
to strategically plan for and undertake projects that will have the
greatest environmental and human health benefits for communities. When
``compliance'' can mean different things from one day to the next--or
one courtroom to the next--running a utility that produces the best
outcomes for its communities while keeping rates affordable and
engaging in forward-looking planning becomes nearly impossible. Reforms
aimed at ensuring that permit writers clearly lay out compliance
requirements could help alleviate such issues.

Question 3. Earlier this year, EPA finalized its revised Financial
Capability Assessment (FCA) Guidance, a critical tool designed to gauge
how much a community can afford to pay to meet its Clean Water Act
(CWA) compliance requirements.
After several years of collaborative work by EPA under the Obama
and Trump Administrations with the water utility sector to revise and
improvise this critical document, the Biden Administration's new final
guidance does away with the progress made under the previous
Administrations. Instead, the guidance appears to give environmental
activists everything they asked for, while leaving the public clean
water utilities that must implement it frustrated and disappointed.
Can you discuss some of the water affordability challenges
communities are facing? What is the importance of ensuring any FCA
guidance truly looks at the impact of CWA mandates and related bill
increases on low-income households?
Answer. Currently countless American households, both urban and
rural, are struggling to pay their increasing water and sewer bills all
while public utilities are facing increased costs of regulatory
compliance, maintaining aging infrastructure, inflation and supply
chain issues to name a few. Other growing costs which will impact water
bills, such as addressing emerging contaminants and PFAS, loom on the
horizon and will make the water affordability challenge even greater.
NACWA and its utility members partnered with other water sector and
municipal groups for many years to advocate for an updated approach to
EPA's Financial Capability Assessment Guidance that looks at the
impacts of new CWA mandates and related bill increases on actual low-
income households within an impacted community, as opposed to more
broad-brush comparisons of community and national level metrics that
often serve to mask the actual impact on individual households.
Congress has weighed in over several year including directing a report
providing recommendations to improve the guidance.
Unfortunately, despite years of good progress made with both the
Obama and Trump Administration, EPA's new FCA Guidance released this
past February fails to take this household level approach, meaning that
the true impacts on these households--many in Environmental Justice
communities--may not be fully considered and leaving them to continue
paying a disproportionately higher amount of their income on clean
water bills.
The new Guidance also includes an arbitrary cap on the amount of
time communities may be allowed to implement CWA mandates and a new
requirement for communities to complete a complex economic analysis
before regulators will consider providing extended compliance
schedules. Both these elements will make it much more difficult, and
expensive, for communities to address affordability challenges for
their low-income residents.
It is important for Congress to conduct oversight and call on EPA
to rewrite this guidance in a manner that actually looks at CWA
compliance through the lens of poor households and families who can't
afford sudden and major rate increases.

Questions from Hon. Grace F. Napolitano to Mickey Conway, Chief
Executive Officer, Metro Water Recovery, Denver, Colorado, on behalf of
the National Association of Clean Water Agencies

Question 1. What would be the consequence to your utility and other
NACWA wastewater facilities of H.R. 2811, the House Republican proposal
to eliminate roughly one-quarter of the annual investments in
addressing the nation's water infrastructure challenge?
Answer. NACWA greatly appreciates the investments made under the
IIJA to help water utilities maintain and upgrade the critical clean
water infrastructure that is critical to protecting the human health
and environments of the communities we proudly serve.
Even with those investments, over 90 percent of investment in water
still comes from local ratepayers and states. Public clean water
utilities and their communities are facing increasingly complex and
costly challenges that require maintaining and growing investment, not
reducing investment. These include reinvesting in aging infrastructure;
managing escalating operations and maintenance costs and supply chain
disruptions; attracting and retaining a skilled workforce; addressing
new water quality impairments and regulations such as for per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and nutrients; and investing in
climate adaptation and system resiliency and security. It is a constant
challenge for public clean water utilities as they work to meet these
challenges and strive to provide the highest level of service while
preserving water affordability for local ratepayers.
In order to ensure that communities have the resources they need to
make critical clean water investments and ensure regulatory compliance
without placing undue financial burdens on the backs of ratepayers, it
is imperative that the new investments passed into law by Congress in
recent years be fully provided as promised in the years ahead.

Question 2. What would be the impact to your ratepayers and average
American families served by municipal wastewater facilities if they had
to make up the difference for the cuts in clean water infrastructure
spending proposed in H.R. 2811? How would your utility make up the
difference in clean water funds forgone by enactment of H.R. 2811, or
would this work simply not be carried out?
Answer. As stated above, over 90 percent of investment in water
still comes from local ratepayers and states. The increased federal
investment provided by Congress in recent years is providing pivotal
help to many local communities to meet their clean water investment
needs without further overburdening customers. Without this federal
investment, more communities would need to look to more costly market-
rate financing which would increase water rates for decades to come.
Other utilities may need to forgo projects that have the potential to
manage or reduce operational costs long term or meet related utility
objectives, such as improving storm resilience. For these reasons we
hope to see Congress' investment promises fulfilled in the years ahead.

Question 3. How has the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law requirement
that 49 percent of Clean Water State Revolving Fund be distributed as
grants or principal forgiveness benefited the families your utility
serves?
Answer. Metro has not utilized directly the CWSRF dollars provided
under IIJA to date. We are working with many of our regional
communities to help them access these critical dollars.
Generally speaking, the IIJA provision requiring that 49 percent of
the dollars flowing out to the SRF programs to be allocated by the
states as additional subsidy is particularly important for getting
federal help to disadvantaged communities. The additional subsidy can
be in form of forgivable loans or grants, rather than low-interest
loans that need to be repaid, benefiting utilities that might not have
the capacity for loan financing and targeting areas facing serious
needs or financial hardship.
Because the SRFs are run through the states--each of which has its
own rules for applying additional subsidy--EPA has provided
recommendations for how states should consider targeting the subsidy to
reach potentially eligible areas and communities. Strengths of this
guidance including encouraging states to look beyond singular metrics
of disadvantage and consider various metrics such as unemployment, how
water and sewer rates compare to lowest quintile income, and ensuring
funds reach urban areas of poverty as well as rural and small
communities.
While EPA has laid out guidance, the task of implementation falls
to the states. Given the significant influx of funding, NACWA strongly
believes that states must be innovative in how they apply this
additional subsidy, and we stand ready to serve as a resource in how
states update their definitions. To date, we have heard from utilities
how numerous states have updated their definitions of disadvantaged
communities to be more inclusive. We recommend that Congress continue
to monitor how additional subsidies are applied and remain open to
potentially providing further direction to the programs as
implementation advances. This will help ensure that IIJA addresses
pervasive issues of equity and access to infrastructure funding.
This is also an area where clean water utilities can help achieve
the goals of IIJA. Particularly in the case of relatively large,
regional sewer systems serving a range of communities within a service
area. Public clean water utilities should be considered as potential
partners to secure and implement federal funding. Public clean water
agencies can help the small and disadvantaged cities and towns in their
area secure federal assistance for which they otherwise may have
struggled to identify as an opportunity, identify a project, apply, and
administer funds. Regional clean water utilities can help provide the
outreach, technical support, and potentially financial strength to help
disadvantaged areas they serve realize the benefits of IIJA.
One challenge to note is that because the additional subsidy is
coming through the SRFs, in order to qualify, applicant communities
need to demonstrate their ability to pay back the funds. This is the
case even with the additional subsidization funding, for which the
community receives loan forgiveness. This can be a challenge in some
instances, for example, stormwater projects that may be eligible
investments under the CWSRF but where a community may not have a sewer
fee that can demonstrate the ability to repay a loan that is eligible
for principal forgiveness. While the SRFs are a tremendous tool to
deliver federal assistance to local communities, there is also an
important role for purely ``grant'' dollars in the scope of future
federal funding.

Questions from Hon. David Rouzer to Brandon Farris, Vice President,
Energy and Resources Policy, National Association of Manufacturers

Question 1. What sort of issues does the Environmental Protection
Agency's (EPA)'s use of Section 404(c) preemptive and retroactive
vetoes outside of the conventional Army Corps 404 process cause? How
does this affect project certainty?
Answer. It is important to have clarity and certainty that
Nationwide Permits can be used to speed up the development of projects
that support manufacturing and energy security. Congress should clarify
that the EPA's authority under Section 404(c) is not to be used to pre-
emptively bar potential activities requiring a Clean Water Act Section
404 permit before there is an applicant or a project; or for the EPA to
make a veto determination under 404(c), an entity must apply for an
actual Section 404 permit with the Army Corps.

Question 2. How would extending the timeframe for Nationwide
Permits (NWPs) from five to ten years create a more conducive
environment for moving critical projects forward?
Answer. In March 2022, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced a
formal review of Nationwide Permit 12 for Oil & Gas Pipeline
activities. NWP 12 is a key permit for pipeline infrastructure
projects, which often take significant capital and time to plan and
construct. Extending the timeframe for an NWP would provide additional
clarity and certainty for the financing and development of projects
that support our energy industry.

Question 3. Since the Corps' issuance and reissuance of NWP 12 is
limited to activities that have ``no effect'' on listed species or
designated critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act (ESA),
what affect does consultation with agencies other than EPA have on
projects that benefit from NWP 12?
Answer. Because the scope of NWP 12 is limited to activities that
have ``no effect'' on listed species or designated critical habitat
under the Endangered Species Act, consultation with agencies other than
the EPA can delay projects without achieving any of the goals of the
ESA.

Question 4. How would including judicial review timelines, as have
been proposed in other judicial review provisions, for individual or
general permits under NWP 12 improve project completion and certainty?
Answer. Manufacturers appreciate the House's efforts on permitting
reform in the Fiscal Responsibility Act, and the inclusion of a 120-day
claims bar in the House-passed Limit, Save, Grow Act. We hope the bill
sets the stage for more comprehensive permitting reform in months to
come. Setting reasonable timelines for bringing legal challenges would
significantly improve project certainty. Federal agency actions have
routinely been challenged. In some instances, legal challenges were
brought forward after significant financial investment in a project or
a project had started construction. A lack of a timeline for judicial
review introduces substantial project uncertainty for companies that
rely on federal decision making.

Question from Hon. Doug LaMalfa to Brandon Farris, Vice President,
Energy and Resources Policy, National Association of Manufacturers

Question 1. Mr. Farris, I have a bill, H.R. 1586, the Forest
Protection and Wildland Firefighter Safety Act, which will continue the
current policy allowing aircraft to deploy fire retardant to fight and
prevent wildfires. It is my understanding that the National Association
of Manufacturers has members that, as the makers of aerial fire
retardant and also the aircraft used to fight these fires, are quite
familiar with this situation. As you may know, due to recent legal
activity, the federal agencies in charge of fighting wildfires on our
public lands are in danger of losing this absolutely essential tool.
Can you tell us what the repercussions will be if the courts rule that
aerial firefighting must be halted until a permit can be issued?
Additionally, I have seen some half-measures proposed, designed to
provide only temporary legal relief instead of a permanent solution, to
fix this problem. Can you please explain why a more lasting solution,
such as that found in H. R. 1586, is preferred?
Answer. As you noted, manufacturers in America make aerial fire
retardants as well as the aircraft used to fight wildfires. The
devastation wildfires cause is severe, and the effects are widespread,
with nearly 100 million people in North America experiencing very poor
air quality due to the current wildfires in Canada.\1\ The agencies in
charge of fighting wildfires need access to every tool in their arsenal
for appropriate wildfire response. Lives and health are at risk if
aerial firefighting is halted until a permit can be issued. Time is of
the essence, and the longer a wildfire is allowed to burn, the greater
the devastation. A more lasting solution is preferred to ensure that
the people tasked with keeping us safe from wildfires have every tool
at their disposal.
