SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Water Resources and
Environment
FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Water Resources and
Environment
RE:      LSubcommittee Hearing on ``Proposals for a Water
Resources Development Act of 2024: Members' Day Hearing''
_______________________________________________________________________

I. PURPOSE

The Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment of the
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will meet on
Thursday, January 11, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. ET in 2167 Rayburn
House Office Building to receive Member testimony at a hearing
entitled, ``Proposals for a Water Resources Development Act of
2024: Members' Day Hearing.'' The purpose of this hearing is to
provide Members of the House of Representatives with an
opportunity to testify before the Subcommittee on their
priorities related to the United States Army Corps of Engineers
(Corps). Testimony will help to inform the drafting of a Water
Resources Development Act (WRDA) for 2024, which the Committee
expects to approve this year.

II. BACKGROUND

The Corps is the Federal Government's largest water
resources development and management agency.\1\ The Corps'
primary civil works missions are riverine and coastal
navigation, the reduction of flood damage risks along inland
and coastal waters, and projects to restore and protect the
aquatic ecosystems.\2\ Additionally, the Corps provides outdoor
recreation opportunities, offers water supply storage to state
and local partners, assists in emergency response, participates
in the construction of environmental infrastructure projects,
and is a leading producer of hydropower in the United
States.\3\ To achieve its mission, the Corps plans, designs,
and constructs water resources development projects, which are
authorized through WRDAs, enacted biennially by Congress since
2014.\4\

WRDA is the authorizing vehicle for Corps' policy, studies,
and construction of projects. To date, the Committee is in
receipt of three Reports from the Chief of Engineers for the
authorization of completed feasibility studies. The Committee
also received the Section 7001 Annual Report to Congress on
Future Water Resources Development (Section 7001 Report) for
2023. The Committee has not received the Section 7001 Report
for 2024, which is due in February 2024. Access to these

PROPOSALS FOR A WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2024: MEMBERS' DAY
HEARING

----------

Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:03 a.m. in
room 2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. David Rouzer

Mr. Rouzer. The Subcommittee on Water Resources and
Environment will come to order.
I ask unanimous consent that the chairman be authorized to
declare a recess at any time during today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that Members not on the

I now recognize myself for the purposes of an opening
statement for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID ROUZER OF NORTH CAROLINA,
CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON WATER RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT

Mr. Rouzer. Today's hearing marks the third in a series
this subcommittee is holding in preparation for the Water
Resources Development Act, or WRDA, as we call it, of 2024. In
December, we heard from representatives of the Army Corps of
Engineers and national stakeholders in our first two WRDA
hearings.
As one of our witnesses stated in our last hearing, WRDA is
the most important piece of legislation, they said, that most
Americans have never heard of. And how true that probably is.
On the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, we are
proud to work hard and draft a WRDA regularly. In fact, since
2014, Congress has passed a WRDA bill every 2 years in
bipartisan fashion.
In addition to being on a dependable and predictable
schedule, these bills have been bipartisan and consensus-based,
ensuring consistency and certainty, which provides greater
benefit for stakeholders and communities across the country. I
look forward to continuing this tradition and working with my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass another WRDA bill
this year.
WRDA is a critical legislative vehicle, ensuring
communities' water resources needs are met nationwide.
Navigation, flood control, beach nourishment, ecosystem
restoration, hydropower, water supply, and recreation at Corps
facilities are all important issues we will address in this
year's WRDA. In other words, our Nation needs WRDAs to keep our
communities safe and functional.
Today, I look forward to hearing directly from my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle on the priorities
important to them and their constituents and how they will
benefit communities across our country. I thank each and every
one of them for taking time out of their busy schedule to be
with us today.
[Mr. Rouzer's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. David Rouzer, a Representative in Congress

Mr. Rouzer. And with that, I now recognize Ranking Member
Napolitano for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO OF CALIFORNIA,
RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON WATER RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT

Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this
third hearing in a series of our informed development of a new
WRDA for 2024.
The Army Corps of Engineers are our largest water managers
in the Nation and our resident experts on everything from flood
prevention to water supply to aquatic ecosystem restoration. We
have so far heard excellent testimony from Assistant Secretary
of Army for Civil Works Michael Connor, as well as Lieutenant
General Scott Spellmon, Chief of Engineers at the Corps.
We also have heard from highly engaged stakeholders who
shared helpful insight into the impacts and policies of the
Corps' work. Truly, every different perspective is helpful to
our work here.
Today, we welcome our Members of Congress to present their
priorities for consideration in WRDA 2024. The Corps operates
nationwide with impacts on just about every single district in
the country.
With a reach so far and wide, we need to make sure we
recognize the specific issues facing our communities. These
will be totally different on the east coast versus the west,
and even different within a particular State.
The testimony we receive today will help to inform us on
what matters most to our colleagues as we move forward with
drafting legislation. This local perspective is key to helping
our communities achieve their desired outcomes and ensuring the
Corps' expertise is accessible to all those who seek it.
As we start developing our sixth consecutive, bipartisan
WRDA bill, we are seeing that the legislation has become a
product of its own success. Our constituency demands and now
expects that we move forward in developing this legislation
every Congress. This consistency and predictability is
essential to the Corps itself and stakeholders across the
country.
Mr. Chairman, I look forward to a continued partnership
with you in addressing the unique needs of Members on both
sides of the aisle. The success of this committee on WRDAs has
come from recognizing that collaboration and compromise are the
tools to success in hyper-partisan times. That was true under
the leadership of former Chairman Shuster and Chair DeFazio,
and I look forward to a similar path under your leadership and
the leadership of Chairman Graves.
Thank you to all Members who have made time to come before
the committee today. I look forward to your testimony and
working with you to write another successful WRDA and continue
the important work of the Corps for water resources projects
nationwide.

Mrs. Napolitano. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentlelady. I now recognize the
ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Larsen, for up to 5
minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I want
to welcome everyone to our Member Day hearing, which is an
opportunity for our House colleagues to share with this
committee their needs and priorities that are most pressing for
their constituents.
Close to 40 Members have signed up to testify today, and
this committee is now working together on solving local water
resources challenges and creating economic opportunity for the
people we represent. That history of success is evidenced by
the five bipartisan and bicameral WRDAs enacted since 2014, a
tradition we expect to carry forward with passage of this sixth
WRDA in a row.
The enthusiasm of Members seeking to testify today is not
surprising. This hearing is happening at a very important time.
After years of neglect, we are now seeing real and sustained
investments in our Nation's water-related infrastructure,
including ports and harbors, flood risk reduction for
communities, and restoration of the natural environment.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, or BIL, is delivering
tangible results for communities all across the country. The
BIL provided a massive downpayment, a total of about $17
billion, for studying and implementing critical WRDA projects.
Ensuring that we continue to build on that success is
essential, and the testimony that our colleagues deliver today
will aid us in that effort.
WRDA 2024 is also an opportunity to continue to advance the
policy achievements of the last few WRDAs, including supporting
America's competitive edge by investing in harbor and inland
waterway navigation; making investments that create jobs and
opportunities for everyone; building climate-resilient
communities; increasing equity across Corps projects,
especially to advance the needs of economically disadvantaged
and Tribal communities; and addressing local water and
wastewater infrastructure needs.
So, thank you, Mr. Chair, for your commitment and working
in a bipartisan manner to see this legislation over the finish
line. Including a diverse range of perspectives is essential to
ensuring the work of this committee meets the needs of people
from across the country. Making sure our Members can directly
advocate for their districts is an essential part of this
process.
So, I want to thank all the Members who have made time to
come to the committee today. I am eager to hear your testimony.
[Mr. Larsen of Washington's prepared statement follows:]

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. I would now like to

here today.
I will not go over the light system. I think you all know
that pretty well. I will just add we are not the United States
Senate, so, keep your comments short.
I ask unanimous consent that the witnesses' full statements
be included in the record.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record of today's
hearing remain open until such time as our witnesses have
provided answers to any questions that may be submitted to them
in writing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 days for any additional comments and information
submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in the record
of today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
As your written testimony has been made part of the record,
the subcommittee asks that you limit your oral remarks to 5
minutes.
Further, given the number of Members appearing before the
subcommittee today, and out of consideration for our
colleagues' time, I ask unanimous consent that members of the
subcommittee be given 2 minutes to question each Member witness
if they so choose following their statements.
Without objection, so ordered.
With that, we will start with our great friend and
colleague, Mrs. Carol Miller from West Virginia.
You are recognized for up to 5 minutes.

Act request. I really appreciate----
Mr. Rouzer [interrupting]. Bring that microphone a little
closer to you.
Mrs. Miller of West Virginia. I appreciate your time and
your attention. I have requested a feasibility study at the
R.D. Bailey watershed in Mingo and Wyoming Counties of West
Virginia.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers started an environmental
impact and feasibility study within the watershed at the cost
of a private company in 2020. In 2022, without providing an
explanation, the Corps terminated the study prematurely after
already spending part of the private funding. In other words,
they stopped midstream. Not only was this a waste of money, it
was a huge waste of time, and it didn't end in any information
being released about the watershed.
Therefore, I would like to request that the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers be mandated to complete a feasibility study at the
R.D. Bailey watershed so that we can better complete and
understand the area and how certain activities might impact the
R.D. Bailey Dam.
Thank you very much for having me before your committee and
considering my request.

TESTIMONY OF HON. GRACE MENG, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM
THE STATE OF NEW YORK

Ms. Meng. Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano,
Ranking Member Larsen, and distinguished members of the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water
Resources and Environment, thank you for allowing me to testify
today. I am honored to share with you all my priorities as the
committee considers reauthorization of WRDA of 2024 that will
support the safety and well-being of my constituents in Queens,
New York.
Two years ago, I testified in front of this committee about
the horrifying impacts that Hurricane Ida had on New York City.
The storm, sadly, took the lives of 13 New Yorkers, many of
whom were my constituents. I told the committee about how New
York's 100-plus-year-old stormwater system is unable to keep up
with increasingly powerful and frequent storms that cause
deadly flooding and economic damage to Queens. And now I sit
before you in 2024, which will mark the 3-year anniversary of
Ida, to inform you that Queens is still at risk from these
storms.
In Queens, we view terms like ``100-'' or ``500-year
floods'' with skepticism, because we know from experience that
these storms are occurring with greater frequency. A year after
Ida, many of my constituents who were still recovering from
storm damage were again hit by horrific flooding. During that
storm, the city of New York sent out an emergency alert
advising people who live in basement apartments, for example,
to move to higher floors. And even in the 2 weeks before Ida,
Tropical Storm Henri broke the existing record for rainfall in
the city.
I can go on, but the evidence is clear: these storms are
occurring with greater frequency, and New York City is not
prepared.
In the Water Resources Development Act of 2022, I was proud
to secure a $119 million authorization for Queens, and now I am
asking for that authorization to please be increased to $250
million in the 2024 reauthorization. This would authorize the
Army Corps of Engineers to spend up to $250 million to work
with the city of New York in upgrading environmental
infrastructure in Queens. This could fund projects that
directly address the devastating flooding that my constituents
face, and to help save lives.
Thank you again for your time and consideration of this
matter. I ask that the chairman and ranking member consider my
request for inclusion in this year's WRDA reauthorization to
protect the people of Queens. Thank you.

TESTIMONY OF HON. BRYAN STEIL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN

Mr. Steil. Thank you very much, Chairman Rouzer, and thank
you to the members of the committee for joining us today.
Mr. Rouzer. Bring that microphone closer to you.
Mr. Steil. Let me see if I can get it--is that better for
you? Thank you very much.
In January 2020, storms dramatically impacted many
communities on the Great Lakes. We have had high water levels,
we have had challenges to breakwaters. Under current law, what
we see is a real difficulty of smaller communities accessing
Federal funds, and the answer here is to make sure that we are
revising WRDA in a manner that actually allows smaller
communities, and particularly those along the Great Lakes, to
be able to access Federal funds that already exist to make
important repairs in both harbors and breakwaters.
If the repairs aren't made to some of the aging and damaged
breakwaters, flooding and storms can threaten many of our
communities, communities like Racine or Kenosha, Wisconsin, in
my district, but communities all across the Great Lakes. And
so, for that reason, I am here today to advocate for my
proposal to add to the 2024 Water Resources Development Act.
My proposed language would provide another avenue for
publicly owned, underserved community harbors, particularly
ones in the Great Lakes, to obtain Federal funding for certain
water infrastructure projects. Should the language be included
in the finalized 2024 WRDA bill, more communities struggling to
generate the necessary capital to complete critical water
infrastructure and harbor maintenance projects would qualify
for that assistance.
It would also remove one of the barriers to expeditiously
complete dredging projects, which is really essential for many
of our Great Lakes harbors.
I appreciate the subcommittee's engagement with my staff on
this issue, and I look forward to our offices' continued
collaboration.
[Mr. Steil's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Bryan Steil, a Representative in Congress
From the State of Wisconsin
Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the committee, for hosting this
hearing.
In January 2020, winter storms and high water levels caused
significant damage to many Great Lakes communities' water
infrastructure, such as the Racine harbor breakwater in my district.
If repairs are not made to the aging and damaged breakwater,
flooding and storms will threaten Racine's historic downtown and urban
Root River revitalization plans.
For that reason, I am here today to advocate for my proposed
addition to the 2024 Water Resources Development Act (WRDA).
My proposed language would provide an additional avenue for
publicly owned, underserved community harbors, particularly ones in the
Great Lakes, to receive federal assistance for certain water
infrastructure projects.
Should this language be included in a finalized 2024 WRDA bill,
more communities struggling to generate the necessary capital to
complete important water infrastructure projects and harbor maintenance
would qualify for funding.
It would also remove one of the barriers in the way of the
expeditious completion of dredging projects.

TESTIMONY OF HON. ED CASE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM
THE STATE OF HAWAII

Mr. Case. Thank you, Mr. Chair, Ranking Member, members of
the committee, and thank you very much for allowing me to
testify today on our 2024 Water Resources Development Act. A
special mahalo to Mr. Larsen for visiting Honolulu to look at
some of our critical projects last week. I certainly invite the
committee members to do the same.
I have policy requests, related requests for your
consideration, but today I want to highlight two critical U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers projects that must be addressed in WRDA
this year. These projects are located in my district of
Honolulu proper, but both of them are also critical to the
basic functioning of Hawaii statewide.
The first is the Ala Wai Flood Risk Management Project,
which was first conceived back in 1999 and was authorized and
funded by Congress for design and construction in our 2018
WRDA. This project will address severe flood risk across the
Ala Wai watershed, which is in Honolulu proper, running from
the top of the mountains down to the ocean in central Honolulu.
This endangers the life, property, and livelihood of about
200,000 residents of this watershed.
But equally important, Waikiki, which is the engine of our
tourist economy, our number-one economy in Hawaii, lies at the
ocean edge of this particular watershed, and a flood of any
magnitude would cause untold damage to our overall economy.
The Corps worked over the last couple of years since 2018
to revise its original plan authorized in the prior WRDA in an
effort to meet community concerns, and ultimately paused the
project in June of 2021 while those concerns were addressed.
The Corps has recently come back with a proposed revised plan
at a cost of $1 billion-plus, and that plan is currently out
for comment on a draft EIS with an expected finalization in
mid-year. The continuation of this critical project will
require further WRDA authorization.
Also in central Honolulu, Honolulu Harbor, the State of
Hawaii's primary harbor is way overdue for extensive
modifications to assure our current and next generation
maritime needs. Honolulu Harbor, which in its modern
configuration was completed in 1952, is the linchpin to life in
Hawaii. As an isolated island State, about 80 percent of our
goods and materials are imported, and 95 percent of these
imported goods and materials comes through Honolulu Harbor. So,
the harbor is not only the harbor that serves the island of
Oahu, which we have our principal population center on, but is
also the transshipment point for virtually all shipping out to
the other islands of Hawaii. And by the way, it is also the
shipping point focus for the exports from Oahu and the rest of
the State.
As I said, the harbor is way overdue for just basic
navigational and operational upgrades, which are required for
continued functioning for both civilian use and elements of our
military communities. And Congress recognized as much by
authorizing and funding a full Army Corps study of
modifications through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. That
investigation is already well underway, but the Corps believes
that the study authorization must be updated to reflect the
expanded complexity, scope, and funding needs.
Additionally, in the course of this initial investigation,
our local partner, the Hawaii State Department of
Transportation, has strongly expressed the necessity of
expanding the study scope to include elements of coastal storm
risk management and resiliency. Providing this additional
refined and expanded authorization will ensure that our
critical harbor is designed for resilience, and that this
literal lifeline for Hawaii remains operational in the face of
natural disaster and weather modification contingencies.
Thank you again so much for allowing me to testify in
support of these critical projects, and I look forward to
working with the committee to advance these authorizations in
our current WRDA cycle.
[Mr. Case's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Ed Case, a Representative in Congress From
the State of Hawaii
Chair Graves, Ranking Member Larsen and Members of the Committee:
Mahalo for allowing me to testify today on critical priorities for
Hawai`i ahead of the Committee's consideration of the 2024 Water
Resources Development Act (WRDA). Mahalo again to you, Ranking Member
Larsen, for visiting Honolulu last week to examine our WRDA needs and
other infrastructure priorities in person.
While I will also be submitting policy-related requests for your
consideration, I want to highlight two critical current U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers projects that must be addressed in WRDA this year. Without
further action by Congress, both the ongoing Honolulu Harbor
Modifications and Ala Wai Flood Risk Management projects could face
long-term delays with significant consequences. While located in my
district of Honolulu proper and of direct relevance to hundreds of
thousands of my constituents, both projects are also crucial to the
basic functioning of Hawai`i statewide.
The Ala Wai Flood Risk Management Project began in 1999 and was
authorized and funded by Congress for design and construction in the
2018 WRDA. The project will address severe flood risks across the Ala
Wai watershed, running from the top of the Ko'olau mountains through
much of central Honolulu to the ocean. that endanger the property,
livelihoods and lives of some 200,000 residents in Honolulu. Waikiki,
the engine of our top economy, also lies exclusively within this
watershed, and an unmitigated flood of any magnitude would cause untold
damage to our overall economy. The Corps estimates that a major flood
in the watershed would cause more than $1.1 billion to structures
alone; that is likely conservative and does not include overall
economic damage.
The Corps has worked to revise its original plan, authorized in the
prior WRDA, in an effort to meet community concerns, and ultimately
paused the project in June 2021 while those concerns were addressed.
The Corps has recently released a proposed revised plan at a cost of $1
billion-plus; that plan is currently out for comment with an expected
finalization in April-June of this year. The continuation of this
critical project will require further WRDA authorization.
Also in central Honolulu, Honolulu Harbor, the State of Hawaii's
primary harbor is overdue for extensive modifications to assure our
current and next-generation maritime needs. The Harbor, which in its
modern configuration was completed in 1952, is the lynchpin to life in
Hawai`i. As an isolated island state, about 80 percent of Hawaii's
goods and materials are imported, 95 percent of which arrive by ship
through Honolulu Harbor. The Harbor serves not only the Island of
O'ahu, but also is the transshipment point for virtually all shipping
imports to the other islands of Hawai'i. It is further the shipping
point for exports from O'ahu and the rest of the state.
The Harbor is way overdue for basic navigational and operational
upgrades which are required for continued functioning for both civilian
use and elements of our military communities. Congress recognized as
much by authorizing and funding a full Army Corps study of
modifications through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. While that
investigation is already well underway, the Corps believes that the

elements of coastal storm risk management. Providing this additional
refined and expanded authorization will ensure our critical harbor is
designed for resilience and that this literal lifeline for Hawai`i
remains operational in the face of natural disaster and weather
modification contingencies.
Mahalo again for allowing me to testify in support of these two
critical projects. I look forward to working with the Committee to
advance these updated authorizations in the current WRDA cycle.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Higgins, you are now

TESTIMONY OF HON. CLAY HIGGINS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA

Mr. Higgins of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, Madam Ranking
Member, members of the committee, thank you for allowing me to
address you today.
Louisiana is home to many of the Nation's largest ports and
most trafficked waterways, some of the largest flood mitigation
and coastal restoration projects. Each of these assets relies
on WRDA's policy guidance and funding support through the
workplan for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
I would like to particularly stress the importance of
dredging the Calcasieu Ship Channel. This is a 64-mile channel
originally intended to be 400 feet wide and 40 feet deep. It
extends into the Gulf of Mexico, and it provides access to the
epicenter of LNG export for the entire country. We are seeking
authorization to deepen the channel by up to 5 feet. This is
very important. Doing so would provide under keel clearance for
larger vessels, increasing the safety of oceangoing vessels
transiting the channel and generating new economic
opportunities for the region and the country.
The ships are getting bigger. This is the single most
important ship channel, arguably, in the country as it relates
to our delivery of clean, affordable energy across the world.
The Calcasieu Ship Channel delivers over 60 percent of the LNG
sent to our allies overseas, so, the performance of the
Calcasieu Ship Channel impacts the world.
Further, rock jetties that were congressionally authorized
for the Calcasieu River and Pass Project to protect the 400-
foot-wide inside channel require extension in the Gulf of
Mexico, about 1\1/2\ miles. Rock jetties are a simple formula
that work very well, but we require the appropriate funding and
authorization to extend those jetties. This is supported by the
Army Corps of Engineers, as well.
Regarding money, the Calcasieu River and Pass Project and
the Port of Lake Charles generate $39.1 billion in economic
activity and $2.6 billion in Federal revenue annually. It
supports 108,700 direct and indirect jobs in Louisiana, and
about 160,000 jobs nationwide. It is estimated that once these
new investments are realized, an additional $74.5 billion will
be contributed to the national economy and an additional $5.24
billion annually in Federal tax revenue.
Additionally, my office has submitted several requests
aimed at advancing coastal restoration projects along the gulf
coast and improving flood mitigation in water management
strategies. These efforts are critical for coastal and inland
communities across south Louisiana and protecting the LNG
industrial sector.
I appreciate the time we were granted today to address the
committee, and I look forward to answering your questions.
[Mr. Higgins of Louisiana's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Clay Higgins, a Representative in Congress
From the State of Louisiana
Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, subcommittee Chairman
Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano, thank you for the opportunity to
discuss the importance of this year's Water Resources Development Act
(WRDA). Over the past iterations of WRDA, Louisiana has been able to
obtain critical wins that protect the environment, bolster more
resilient communities, and support long-term maintenance activities.
Successful WRDA implementation is important to the country, and it
is a vital and critical piece of legislation for South Louisiana. My
state is home to many of the nation's largest ports, most trafficked
waterways, and major hurricane protection and coastal restoration
projects. Each of these assets relies on WRDA's policy guidance and
funding support through the work plan for the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (Corps).
I wish to inform the committee of a few critical projects and
opportunities for this year's WRDA.
First, I would like to discuss the importance of continued funding
for dredging the Calcasieu Ship Channel. We have made major strides in
securing funds to maintain the channel, and we are now seeking new
authorizations to deepen the channel by up to 5 feet. Doing so would
provide safe under-keel clearance for larger vessels, increasing the
safety of ocean-going vessels transiting the channel and generating new
economic opportunities for the region.
Further, rock jetties that were congressionally authorized on the
Calcasieu River and Pass Project to protect the 400-foot-wide
``inside'' channel require extension in the Gulf of Mexico. Extending
the jetty by 1.5 miles is necessary to increase navigational safety,
protect the lives of vessels' crews, and ultimately protect the
environment.
The Calcasieu River and Pass Project and the Port of Lake Charles
generates $39.1 billion in economic activity and $2.6 billion in
federal revenue annually. It supports 108,773 direct and indirect jobs
in Louisiana, as well as 158,485 jobs nationwide. It is estimated that
once these new investments are realized, an additional $74.6 billion
will be contributed to the national economy and an additional $5.24
billion annually in federal tax revenue.
The original investment has turned the Port of Lake Charles into
the 13th busiest port in the nation and serves not only as a major
economic driver for Louisiana, but for the United States as a whole.
Additionally, my office has submitted several requests aimed at
advancing coastal restoration projects along the Gulf Coast and
improving flood mitigation and water management strategies. These
efforts are critical for coastal and inland communities across South
Louisiana. We must continue to prioritize pre-disaster mitigation and
make smart investments in projects that strengthen the resiliency of
our communities.
As the committee reviews requests for WRDA, I implore you to
consider critical projects for Southwest Louisiana. I appreciate the
time given to Members to speak before the committee to discuss the
importance of the Corps and water resource projects today.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Ms. Kaptur, you are now
recognized.

TESTIMONY OF HON. MARCY KAPTUR, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF OHIO

Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member
Napolitano, ranking member of the full committee Mr. Larsen,
and Congressman Garamendi. Thank you for you and your staff for
doing all the work to put this hearing together and to develop
the Water Resources Development Act of 2024. And I must call
out the special qualities of Ranking Member Napolitano. I know
this is her last year of service in the Congress.
But I wish to say that, Congresswoman, your dignity, your
acumen, and your perseverance elevate the reputation of this
House. Thank you so much for your service.
I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the important water
resource development needs of the communities in Ohio's Ninth
Congressional District across northern Ohio, the Lake Erie
Islands, as well as the Great Lakes region as a whole. I hold
the privilege of representing the largest watershed in the
entire Great Lakes region. It drains increasing rainfall and
water flows across segments of three States through our
district into Lake Erie, the southernmost of the Great Lakes.
Our bountiful region agriculturally also is the most tiled
region in our Nation, having been installed to drain what is
known as the Great Black Swamp. We live in a mud puddle. With
increasing rainfall, challenges to subwatershed functional
equilibrium are increasing. The Corps could aid our efforts to
manage these changing circumstances by producing a detailed
subwatershed topographical and directional flow map that can
serve to detail subwatersheds and their interrelationship, so
our region can better handle the rising amounts of rainfall for
proper land and freshwater stewardship, storage, reservoirs,
filtration, necessary tree and vegetation plantings, and
windbreaks.
Another significant challenge is the need to advance the
Corps' critical work maintaining and improving the harbors and
waterways on Great Lakes in a manner that improves water
quality in the largest fresh surface water system on Earth. In
Lake Erie, which borders my district, meeting that goal will
require the Corps and its non-Federal partners to maximize the
beneficial use of dredged material from federally authorized
harbors, even partnering--imagine that--with the U.S.
Department of Agriculture on regenerative soil complements as
our Nation prepares the new farm bill.
Thanks to your committee's inclusion of section 8130(b) in
the WRDA 2022, the Corps is now making progress on dredged
material management plans for the Lake Erie harbors that will
not involve open lake disposal. However, Corps financial
assistance for the design and implementation of dredged
material placement facilities in the State of Ohio continues to
fall short of what is authorized by law.
The State of Ohio and the individual Lake Erie port
authorities have made tremendous investments in beneficial use
placement sites and confined disposal facilities over many
years. It is time for the Corps to step up and cost share these
improvements in accordance with standing authorities. I urge
the committee to direct the Corps to expedite the completion of
cost sharing agreements for the beneficial use placement sites
and confined disposal facilities on Lake Erie that are
currently being planned and designed by non-Federal partners at
their own expense.
Protecting our freshwater kingdom of the Great Lakes also
requires completion of the interbasin invasive species barrier
at Brandon Road Lock and Dam. Located on the Des Plaines River
near Joliet, Illinois, Brandon Road is the central connection
point through which invasive carp species can move between the
Illinois Waterway system into Lake Michigan and the four other
Great Lakes, severely harming native fish species. Two-hundred
twenty-six million dollars from the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act will fund the construction and deployment of
state-of-the-art technologies and innovative programs that
interrupt movement, but local cooperation requirements remain a
challenge to implementation.
Thanks to your committee's work on the WRDA 2022,
construction of the interbasin invasive species barrier now
requires a 90-percent Federal contribution, and the committee
can further ensure implementation by modifying the cost sharing
for operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and
rehabilitation of the measures.
I want to thank the committee for its continued focus on
another ecological problem we face in the Great Lakes, harmful
algal blooms, and I urge the committee to continue supporting
the ongoing work of the Corps for HAB detection, control, and
prevention. I want to urge the committee to expand the scope of
the HAB demonstration program authorized in WRDA 2020 to
address not only HABs associated with water resource projects,
but also HABs that adversely impact large bodies of water of
regional, national, or international significance. That will
ensure that demonstration projects designed to address HABs in
western Lake Erie, some of the most frequent and severe in the
Nation, will be eligible for funding under the Corps' program.
My time is expired, but I strongly urge the committee to
emphasize the importance of demonstration projects designed to
develop and deploy advanced monitoring tools and networks to
address the nutrient loading that is the root cause of HAB at
the source of the problem.
Thank you so very much, and I hope the Corps can help us in
the coming year to find a second water intake location to serve
the large Toledo, Ohio, regional area so our water is never
shut off again for 3 days because of invasive HABs in our water
system. Thank you all so very much.
[Ms. Kaptur's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Marcy Kaptur, a Representative in Congress
From the State of Ohio
Thank you Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, and your
respective staff for the hard work you have put in to developing the
Water Resources Development Act of 2024 (WRDA). On a bipartisan basis,
your Committee has now completed work on five consecutive WRDAs since
2014--advancing significant progress to meet our nation's needs.
The Committee's authorization of new U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
projects, studies, and policies supports local, regional, and national
priorities that have a lasting impact. As Ranking Member of the
Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees the Corps' budget, it is an
honor to partner with you in this mission.
I appreciate the opportunity to discuss with you here today the
important water resources development needs of the communities in my
district and the Great Lakes Region as a whole. Chief among them is the
need to advance the Corps' critical work maintaining and improving the
harbors and waterways on Great Lakes in a manner that improves water
quality in the largest fresh surface water system on earth. In Lake
Erie, which borders my district, meeting that goal will require the
Corps and its non-federal partners to maximize the beneficial use of
dredged material from federally authorized harbors.
Thanks to your Committee's inclusion of section 8130(b) in the WRDA
2022, the Corps is now making progress on dredged material management
plans for the Lake Erie harbors that will not involve open lake
disposal. However, Corps financial assistance for the design and
implementation of dredged material placement facilities in the State of
Ohio continues to fall short of what is authorized by law. The State of

I urge the Committee to direct the Corps to expedite the completion of
cost-sharing agreements for the beneficial use placement sites and
confined disposal facilities on Lake Erie that are currently being
planned and designed by non-federal partners at their own expense.
Protecting our freshwater kingdom of the Great Lakes also requires
completion of the interbasin invasive species barrier at Brandon Road
Lock and Dam. Located on the Des Plaines River near Joliet, Illinois,
Brandon Road is a central connection point through which invasive Carp
species frequently move between the Illinois Waterway system into Lake
Michigan and the four other Great Lakes, severely harming native fish
species. $225.8 million from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
will fund the construction and deployment of state-of-the-art
technologies and innovative programs that interrupt the movement, but
local cooperation requirements remain a challenge to implementation.
Thanks to your Committee's work on the WRDA 2022, construction of the
interbasin invasive species barrier now requires a 90 percent Federal
contribution. The Committee can further ensure implementation by
modifying the cost sharing for operation, maintenance, repair,
replacement, and rehabilitation of the measures.
I would also like to thank the Committee for its continued focus on
another ecological problem that we face in the Great Lakes region:
harmful algal blooms (HABs). The expertise of Corps scientists and
engineers is invaluable in the fight against the devastation wrought by
HABs. The Corps provides resource management, water flow design, and
engineering solutions for HAB prevention, mitigation, and control. I
urge the Committee to continue supporting the ongoing work of the Corps
for testing HAB controls and encouraging continued interagency
cooperation.
In particular, I urge the Committee to expand the scope of the
Harmful Algal Bloom Demonstration program authorized in the WRDA 2020
to address not only HAB associated with water resources development
projects but also HAB that adversely impact large bodies of water of
regional, national, or international significance. This will ensure
that demonstration projects designed to address HAB in Western Lake
Erie, some of the most frequent and severe in the nation, will be
eligible for funding under the Corps' program. Additionally, I urge the
Committee to emphasize the importance of demonstration projects
designed to develop and deploy advanced monitoring tools and networks
and to address the nutrient loading that is the root cause of HAB at
the source of the problem.
Finally, I ask the Committee to consider authorizing a new
Environmental Infrastructure program for the City of Toledo. In 2014,
the City's drinking water service was interrupted due to contamination
from a HAB. While the City has invested vast amounts of funding since
then to mitigate the risk of contamination in the future, a secondary
water source will ultimately be required to ensure that the 2014 crisis
is not repeated.
Thank you again for your dedication to pursuing another WRDA on a
bipartisan basis.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentlelady for her testimony.
Are there any questions for any of the panelists up to now?
Looking and seeing none, you all are free to leave. And
those who have come in, just make your way to your seat.
[Pause.]
Voice. One down, six to go.
[Pause.]
Mr. Rouzer. So, we will start with Ms. Gluesenkamp Perez.
When you are ready, you will have up to 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. MARIE GLUESENKAMP PEREZ, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

Ms. Perez. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer, and thank you,
Ranking Member Larsen.
I have here a typewritten letter from 40 years ago
requesting conveyance of a parcel of land held by the Army
Corps of Engineers in my home county of Skamania County. My
county is over 1 million acres of land. Less than one-half of 1
percent of that is commercially developable. So, this 1.6-acre
lot may seem very small to the committee and small potatoes,
but where I live, this is the kind of thing that can make an
incredible difference in empowering my community to have real
economic opportunity to develop and support themselves. It is a
result of Federal, State, and land trust ownership that we are
so reduced, and so, I ask this body to be different than the 40
years preceding it.
This letter was written before I was born, 2\1/2\ years
before I was born, so, this has been a long time in the making,
and I ask for your urgency in considering this. The Port of
Skamania requested this, and it has been--we have been in
agreement with the Army Corps of Engineers, and so, I
appreciate any urgency we can bring to this.
Secondly, I would like to bring up Wahkiakum County, also
an economically disadvantaged area in my district located on
the Columbia River. It is requesting support from the Army
Corps for a study to address flooding problems in Rosburg and
Grays River. The area regularly experiences flooding. As a
result, fine sediment accumulates at the confluence of the
rivers of Grays and Columbia, and over the past 30 years, the
floods have only gotten worse.
When flooding occurs in the Grays River, it cuts off access
to approximately 500 people living in these rural communities,
often for more than 2 days at a time. Within a matter of hours,
the flooding limits vital emergency services, business
operations, and school transportation, and leaves behind
sediment that can be dangerous and time consuming to remove.
That is why I supported the county's request for the Army Corps
to assess the causes of the fine sediment accumulation and help
determine solutions to mitigate risks for addressing this.
These are two important projects in my district, but they
are just a snapshot of the provisions I look forward to
supporting in this year's WRDA. My district is home to 15 ports
that are critical economic drivers that are very dependent on
the Army Corps and the work authorized in this legislation. I
have been told that I have more ports than any Member of
Congress west of the Mississippi.
These are priorities that are supported by a broad range of
stakeholders in my district, and I look forward to working with
this committee to get them over the finish line. Thank you.
[Ms. Perez's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Representative in
Congress From the State of Washington
Thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen for the
opportunity to testify today.
I'd like to highlight several WRDA priorities for my district in
Southwest Washington, including one that has been in the works since
1986.
Grays River Dredging Project
Up first: Wahkiakum County, an economically disadvantaged area in
my district, located on the Columbia River, is requesting assistance
from the Army Corps for a study to address the flooding problems in
Rosburg and Grays River.
This area regularly experiences flooding, and as a result, fine
sediment accumulation at the confluence of the Grays and Columbia
Rivers. Over the past 30 years, the floods have only gotten worse. When
flooding occurs on the Grays River, it cuts off access to approximately
500 people living in these rural communities, often for two days or
more at a time. Within a matter of hours, this flooding limits vital
emergency services, business operations, and school transportation, and
leaves behind sediment that can be dangerous and time consuming to
remove.
That's why I support the County's request for the Army Corps to
assess the causes of the fine sediment accumulation and help determine
solutions to mitigate risks for the area moving forward.
North Bonneville Conveyance
Secondly, I'd like to highlight an important conveyance request
that has been nearly 40 years in the making in my home county of
Skamania.
As a result of federal, state, and trust land ownership, and the
added development restrictions from the Columbia River Gorge National
Scenic Area, very little land in Skamania County is developable for
commercial or industrial purposes.
In 1986, the Port of Skamania initiated a request to the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers to acquire industrial property and a building in
North Bonneville for the purposes of economic development.
Now, almost 40 years later, the Port is still working to acquire
the 1.6 acre parcel of land and building for economic development. I
support the inclusion of this conveyance in the bill.
These are two projects important to my district, but they are just
a snapshot of the provisions I look forward to supporting in this
year's WRDA.
My district is home to 15 ports that are critical economic drivers
that are very dependent on the Army Corps and the work authorized in
this legislation.
These priorities are supported by a broad set of stakeholders in my
district and I look forward to working with this committee to get them
over the finish line.

Ms. Perez. And I also request to submit this historic piece
of evidence [indicating typewritten letter], the longevity of
this request, to the committee.
Mr. Rouzer. Without objection, so ordered.

Mr. Fry.

TESTIMONY OF HON. RUSSELL FRY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

Mr. Fry. I am here today to join my colleagues in
underscoring the critical role of the Water Resources
Development Act of 2024 for not only my State, but my district,
and convey these specific priorities. I applaud the leadership
of this committee--Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen,
subcommittee Chairman Rouzer, and Ranking Member Napolitano--
for this opportunity.
I am proud to represent the Seventh Congressional District
of the State of South Carolina, which is about half of the
coastline, the northern half of the coastline, and extends
westward into the interior, into an area known as the Pee Dee.
I have submitted several priorities to this committee on behalf
of my constituents, and I want to highlight some of those for
you today.
In the Pee Dee region of South Carolina, in the city of
Florence, they are taking some necessary steps to address
growth and increasing needs of the citizens and community by
providing significant water, wastewater, stormwater, and
environmental restoration. With new industry in the city, a
$1\1/2\ billion economic project that was announced just this
year, plus growth, approximately 4,300 residential units will
increase the capacity needed for water distribution.
Additionally, this will require expansion of wastewater
management and a more efficient sanitary sewer collection
system. I have requested authorization through the Army Corps'
Environmental Infrastructure Program for the city of Florence
to help in this effort.
Unfortunately, the city residents of Florence face water
challenges daily. For example, their drinking water is often
red. If you look at their toilets, there are red rings around
them. If they wash their clothes, they are brown or stained
yellow. I am grateful for the opportunity to hopefully find
solutions to this problem that my constituents face regularly.
North of Florence, Mr. Chairman, lies a town on the border
of North Carolina called Cheraw, South Carolina, which also
faces significant water, wastewater, stormwater, and
environmental restoration needs. I have requested authorization
through the Army Corps' Environmental Infrastructure Program to
enable access to funding for these issues.
The town is taking an aggressive approach in updating its
water infrastructure to improve that quality, upgrade its
critical facilities, and expand capacity to accommodate future
growth. In fact, Mr. Chairman, they cannot grow any more
without this expansion. They are at their limit. Cheraw needs
to construct a new water treatment plant and a wastewater
treatment expansion and implement a stormwater master plan over
the next decade. Without construction of a new water treatment
plant, they are at risk of losing safe access to reliable
drinking water.
This request also aids in the efforts to reduce the impact
of increased localized flooding, while increasing the capacity
in existing stormwater and drainage systems.
Similarly, in the town next to Cheraw, in Chesterfield,
South Carolina, in 2018, Hurricane Florence destroyed a sewer
line crossing the Thompson Creek near the Buchanan Bridge,
allowing raw sewage to spill into the Thompson Creek. The town
of Chesterfield has rented a pump. They have rented a pump
through 2023 to pump around the destroyed sewer line, but the
town has been trying to get the necessary funding, Mr.
Chairman, for a permanent solution since 2018 to replace the
temporary sewer line, install the pump station, and attach the
sewer line to the bridge. Utilizing the Army Corps'
Environmental Infrastructure Authority, the town of
Chesterfield could experience significant relief and aid in its
ongoing recovery efforts from Hurricane Florence, which
occurred over 5 years ago.
And lastly for the committee, I have submitted requests on
behalf of our State's ports. The health and prosperity of South
Carolina's economy and our people are intricately linked to our
State's ports and waterways.
In our State, major infrastructure and investment
initiatives are managed or spearheaded by the South Carolina
Ports Authority, which owns and operates public marine
terminals in the Port of Charleston and two separate inland
ports in Greer, South Carolina, and in my district, Dillon.
Over 70 percent of all cargo exported through the South
Carolina ports originates from companies within the State. In a
region projected to experience significant population growth,
South Carolina is vitally important to the broader economy of
the Nation.
These projects rely on the investments and resources made
possible through the Water Resources Development Act.
Specifically, in this year's bill, I am advocating for three
priorities.
First, to adjust the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Harbor
Maintenance Trust Fund donor port designation requirements to
more effectively capture and recognize the scale of the port's
impact within the State and region, such as that of the South
Carolina Ports Authority and, more specifically, the Port of
Charleston.
Second, to align the cost share for maintenance of harbors
with modernized harbor depths by increasing eligible depths up
to 55 feet, as Charleston and other major east coast ports have
invested heavily in deepening their harbors beyond 50 feet to
meet both commercial demand and the increasing size of vessels
calling on the U.S. ports.
Third and lastly, Mr. Chairman, to authorize a feasibility
study for the Army Corps of Engineers Charleston District to
equalize the Federal navigation channel segment of the North
Charleston Terminal to 52 feet.
I am proud to submit these priorities to the committee, and
I thank you for your time. And with that, I yield back.
[Mr. Fry's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Russell Fry, a Representative in Congress
From the State of South Carolina
I am here today to join my colleagues in underscoring the critical
role of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2024 for my state
and district and to convey my specific priorities on behalf of my
district and the state of South Carolina.
I applaud the leadership of the House Transportation &
Infrastructure Committee and wish to thank Chairman Graves, Ranking
Member Larsen, Subcommittee Chairman Rouzer, and Ranking Member
Napolitano for this opportunity.
I am proud to represent the Seventh Congressional District of South
Carolina, which ranges from the upper half of the South Carolina coast,
known as the Grand Stand, and the inland rural community of the
northwest corridor of the state, known as the Pee Dee.
I have submitted several priorities to the Committee on behalf of
my constituents. Today, I want to highlight some water infrastructure
investment projects in South Carolina's Seventh Congressional District.
In the Pee Dee region, the City of Florence is taking the necessary
steps to address the growth and increasing needs of the citizens and
community by providing significant water, wastewater, stormwater, and
environmental restoration.
The ability to provide safe, reliable drinking water and necessary
water and sewer infrastructure upgrades is only attainable through
expansion and upgrades to their water system.
With new industry in the city, approximately 4,300 residential
units will increase the capacity needed for water distribution.
Additionally, this will require expansion of wastewater management and
a more efficient sanitary sewer collection system.
I have requested authorization through the Army Corps'
Environmental Infrastructure program for the City of Florence to help
in this effort.
These projects would authorize a sanitary sewer collection system
expansion, a wastewater management facility expansion, and a water
distribution expansion and upgrades needed for increased water quality.
Unfortunately, residents in the Florence area face water challenges
daily. For example, their drinking water will turn red and leave a
dusty ring around their toilets, and sometimes laundry turns brown or
yellow due to the discolored water.
I am grateful for this opportunity to hopefully find solutions to
this problem that my constituents across the Pee Dee face regularly.
North of Florence lies the Town of Cheraw, which faces significant
water, wastewater, stormwater, and environmental restoration needs.
I have requested authorization through the Army Corps'
Environmental Infrastructure program to enable access to funding for
water, wastewater, and other environmental infrastructure through this
program.
The Town is taking an aggressive approach to updating its water
infrastructure to improve water quality, upgrade critical facilities,
and expand capacity to accommodate future growth.
Cheraw needs to construct a new water treatment plant and a
wastewater treatment expansion and implement a stormwater master plan
over the next decade.
Without the construction of a new water treatment plant, the
residents of Cheraw are at risk of losing access to safe and reliable
drinking water supplies.
This request also aids in the effort to reduce the impact of
increased localized flooding while increasing capacity in existing
stormwater and drainage systems.
This authorization is crucial for the Town of Cheraw to grow and
provide a place for South Carolinians to live and work.
Similarly, I have requested authorization under the Army Corps'
Environmental Infrastructure program for the Town of Chesterfield,
located in the Pee Dee region of South Carolina.
In September 2018, Hurricane Florence destroyed a sewer line
crossing Thompson Creek near Buchanan Bridge, allowing raw sewage to
spill into Thompson Creek.
The Town of Chesterfield rented a pump until 2023 to pump around
the destroyed sewer line.
Due to the increasing cost of renting a pump and insufficient grant
funds to complete the project, the Town purchased a pump and hoses as a
temporary solution.
The Town has been trying to get the necessary funding for a
permanent solution since 2018 to replace the temporary sewer line and
pump, install a pump station, and attach the sewer line to the bridge.
Utilizing the Army Corps' Environmental Infrastructure Authority,
the Town of Chesterfield could experience significant relief and aid in
its ongoing recovery efforts from Hurricane Florence, which occurred
over five years ago.
Lastly, I have submitted requests in support of our state's ports.
The health and prosperity of South Carolina's economy--and our
people--are intricately linked to our state's ports and waterways.
In our state, major infrastructure and investment initiatives are
managed or spearheaded by the South Carolina Ports Authority, which
owns and operates public marine terminals at the Port of Charleston and
two separate Inland Ports in Greer and in my district, Dillon.
The South Carolina Ports Authority is an economic driver, not only
for our state but for the Southeastern region and the U.S. as a whole.
A recent study conducted by the University of South Carolina Moore
School of Business found that the total economic impact of our state's
ports system is over $86 billion annually.
This translates to supporting over 260,000 jobs related to the
maritime industry alone--and one in nine jobs in the state--and an
annual statewide economic impact of $87 billion. That is nearly $18
billion in annual labor income.
The commerce afforded by our ports system directly supports state
companies and businesses as our state continues to grow as a major
global competitor for advanced manufacturing and other leading export-
oriented industries.
Over 70 percent of all cargo exported through S.C. Ports originates
from companies located in the state. In a region projected to
experience significant population growth, South Carolina is vitally
important to the broader economy.
This growth directly results from state, federal, and private
partnership investments in our port infrastructure, including the
deepened Charleston harbor and increased cargo capacities.
These projects rely on the investments and resources made possible
through the Water Resources Development Act.
Specifically, I am advocating for three priorities in this year's
bill.
First, to adjust the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Harbor
Maintenance Trust Fund Donor Port designation requirements to more
effectively capture and recognize the scale of a port's impact within a
state and region--such as that of South Carolina Ports Authority and
the Port of Charleston.
Second, to align cost-share for maintenance of harbors with
modernized harbor depths by increasing eligible depths to 55 feet, as
Charleston and other major East Coast ports have invested in deepening
their harbors beyond 50 feet to meet both commercial demand and the
increasing size of vessels calling on the U.S. ports.
Third, and lastly, to authorize a Feasibility Study for the Army
Corps' Charleston District to equalize the federal navigation channel
segment of the North Charleston Terminal to 52 feet.
I am proud to submit my priorities for South Carolina to the
Committee for consideration as you craft a responsible and effective
Water Resources Development Act for 2024.
Thank you again for your consideration, and I look forward to
working with you on behalf of my state and district.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Kilmer.

TESTIMONY OF HON. DEREK KILMER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

Mr. Kilmer. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member
Napolitano and ranking member of the full committee, Mr.
Larsen. Thanks for holding this Member Day hearing and for
providing an opportunity to share two of my priorities for the
upcoming Water Resources Development Act.
First, I want to draw your attention to the Ediz Hook Beach
Erosion Control Project near Port Angeles, Washington, where I
grew up. Originally authorized in WRDA 1974, this project
supports our national security goals by helping to maintain
access to the U.S. Coast Guard Station at Port Angeles, while
also protecting Port Angeles Harbor from erosion.
I was pleased that last year the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law actually provided funding for Ediz Hook. Through $1.5
million provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for
revetment repair, this funding ensures that facilities at Ediz
Hook, including the U.S. Coast Guard Base, can benefit.
So, while this funding was good news, we have learned that
this project is the only navigation project overseen by the
Seattle District without a 100-percent Federal cost share for
these purposes. Given the relative economic distress of that
community, given the significant national security importance
of this project and the needed support it would bring to the
city of Port Angeles, my priority request would bring the
Federal cost share for Ediz Hook into line with other O&M
navigation projects.
I also want to highlight the Duckabush Estuary Restoration
Project. This project was identified as part of the Puget Sound
Nearshore Ecosystem Restoration Project, which was authorized
in WRDA 2016. I am proud that the first project to be put into
action from that initiative is in my district.
The Duckabush Estuary Restoration Project will remove a
large amount of fill that was placed in the river flood plain
to support U.S. Highway 101 and replace it with an estuary-
spanning 1,400-foot-long bridge reconnecting the Duckabush
River to the neighboring wetlands and distributary channels.
Not only will this project improve the habitat of fish and
wildlife including, Endangered Species Act-listed Hood Canal
summer chum, but it will also enhance the lives of constituents
through reduced seasonal flood risk, safer roads, and job
creation. That is a WRDA success story.
However, restoring the Duckabush Estuary will change how
local Tribes and the public can access tidelands and the
shellfish resources that they support. One positive but
unintended consequence of the original highway at Duckabush was
that it created direct foot access to shellfish tidelands and
stable conditions favorable for shellfish growth. The Duckabush
tidelands are important to several local Tribes and to the
public, and when the restoration project is completed and the
river flows freely, access to the tidelands will be more
limited.
The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and their
partners are committed to ensuring tideland access
opportunities for Tribes and for the public, making sure that
they remain available on Hood Canal. They are considering other
locations nearby that can provide a similar experience for
local Tribes and other users, and I am requesting Federal
language to provide the flexibility needed to allow for
creative solutions as part of the partnership with the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers on aquatic ecosystem restoration.
Again, I appreciate your leadership and your consideration
of these requests, and I am happy to provide any additional
information as you review them. Thank you again for the
opportunity to testify before the committee today.

TESTIMONY OF HON. RASHIDA TLAIB, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN

Ms. Tlaib. Thank you so much, Chairman, Ranking Member. I
sincerely appreciate the opportunity to help bring the voices
of my constituents and my residents and neighbors regarding
water and the various issues that they are faced with every
single year.
I am here once again, obviously, to talk about how we can
protect our neighbors from flooding and contamination in the
water. Not just lead, beyond even lead. Our communities, as you
all know, are on the front lines of the climate crisis, and
these floods are only continuing to get worse and worse every
single year. At the same time, we have aging infrastructure
that subjects them to various health dangers. Mostly, again,
for my communities, it is exposure to contaminated drinking
water.
And you hear from many of our colleagues, we need to move
with urgency. I know our neighborhoods in the 12th
Congressional District have experienced 1,000-year rainfalls,
and some homes have flooded repeatedly. In one neighborhood in
my district, three times in one spring and summer, and these
are working class, many retirees, autoworkers who cannot
afford, again, the damage that continues to happen to their
homes.
In some of our communities, raw sewage flows through the
streets. Some of our residents still have water standing in
their basements. I still remember knocking on the door of one
of my senior residents in her mid-seventies with FEMA as we
went door to door to confirm some of the damage, and she had
the sewage water in her basement literally freeze over. She
didn't have the resources nor know-all of how, again, to
address it.
We know that, meanwhile, millions of people across
southeastern Michigan right now, Chairman, and the country, are
still getting their water from lead pipes. And we haven't
dedicated close enough money or mobilized resources to address
this threat as quickly as we need to. Our local communities
can't do it on their own. They continue to tell me that over
and over again. They are required in Michigan to continue to
test, and they confirm again contamination. But the State and
the Federal Government hasn't been able to do enough to fund
the remediation that is needed.
I note our flood maps and projections our communities rely
on still don't account for our rapidly warming planet and are
simply out of date. And the water infrastructure in these
communities is unacceptably outdated, inadequate for extreme
weather events we now face. As the weather events again get
worse and worse, our communities need the tools. And this is
where you all can come in. This year's WRDA presents an
opportunity to equip our communities with improved planning and
modern, resilient infrastructure in WRDA.
First, I encourage the committee to offer support to
Detroit's division of the Army Corps of Engineers for a flood
study of Rouge River. Rouge River, Mr. Chairman, is a watershed
in my district, and it impacts a number of communities within
the largest populated county in Michigan. And the Rouge touches
communities throughout 12th district, but also the 11th and
others, as you will hear, as well as the 6th district and the
13th. So, we need to better understand how to mitigate the
flooding issues that come from the Rouge River.
Second, I urge the committee to adopt language that
streamlines the real estate requirements for replacing lead
service lines on private property. This is critical. We learned
a lot from Flint, and that was one of the issues that continued
to come up so we can finish the job and replace lead service
lines all the way up to the resident's home.
Third, I am submitting a number of requests in support of
the Great Lakes Water Authority's efforts to prevent and
mitigate flooding in both specific neighborhoods in my district
experiencing repeated flooding events, but also across
southeastern Michigan. And these requests are critical to the
resiliency of our region. As you know, it is very critical to
our country, and investments cannot come soon enough.
Fourth, I am also submitting requests in support of the
Army Corps' priorities for improving the navigation across the
Great Lakes, Mr. Chair, which supports billions--billions--of
dollars in economic activity and recreation for our communities
across the country, really.
And I appreciate the opportunity, again, for all the
Members that are here, to share the priorities of my
constituents and residents, and respectfully request their
inclusion in the 2024 Water Resources Development Act. Thank
you.
[Ms. Tlaib's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Rashida Tlaib, a Representative in Congress
From the State of Michigan
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today and share
WRDA priorities that are critical for the communities I represent.
I am here once again to talk about what we need to do to protect my
residents from flooding and lead in their water.
Our communities are on the front lines of the climate crisis, and
these floods are only going to continue to get worse and more frequent.
At the same time, our aging infrastructure subjects them to health
dangers like lead.
We have to move with urgency.
Our neighborhoods have experienced 1,000-year rainfalls, and some
homes have flood repeatedly. In some of these communities, raw sewage
flowed through the streets. Some of our residents still have water
standing in their basements from floods that took place months and even
years ago.
Meanwhile, millions of people across Southeast Michigan--and the
country--are still getting their water from lead pipes, and we haven't
dedicated close to enough money or mobilized resources to address this
threat as quickly as we need.
Our residents deserve better. They deserve action. They need these
investments we're here to talk about today.
The flood maps and projections our communities rely on still don't
account for our rapidly warming planet and are simply out of date. And
the water infrastructure in these communities is unacceptably outdated
and inadequate for the extreme weather events we now face.
I refuse to accept this as our new normal.
As these catastrophic weather events get stronger and more
frequent, our communities need the tools to be prepared. This year's
WRDA presents an opportunity to equip our communities with improved
planning and modern, resilient infrastructure.
First, I encourage the Committee to offer support to the Detroit
Division of the Army Corps of Engineers for a flood study of the Rouge
River watershed in my district. The Rouge touches so many of our
communities in the 12th District, and we need to better understand how
to mitigate its flooding issues.
Second, I urge the Committee to adopt language that streamlines the
real estate requirements for replacing lead service lines on private
property, so that we can finish the job and replace lead service lines
all the way up to a resident's home.
Third, I am submitting a number of requests in support of the Great
Lakes Water Authority's efforts to prevent and mitigate flooding in
both specific neighborhoods in my district experiencing repeated
flooding events and across all of Southeast Michigan. These requests
are critical to the resiliency of our region, and the investments
cannot come soon enough.
Fourth, I am also submitting requests in support of the Army Corps'
priorities for improving navigation across our Great Lakes, which
support billions of dollars in economic activity and recreation.
I appreciate the opportunity to share my priorities before this
Committee, and respectfully request their inclusion in the 2024 Water
Resources Development Act. Thank you.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentlelady.
Mrs. Houchin.

TESTIMONY OF HON. ERIN HOUCHIN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF INDIANA

Mrs. Houchin. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and to Ranking
Member Larsen. Thank you for hosting Member Day and allowing me
to address this committee. I am here today to discuss an issue
that has impacted my constituents since long before I came to
Congress: the erosion of the Clarksville shoreline.
Since 1963, when the Army Corps of Engineers finished the
lock and dam system in the Ohio River, it started redirecting
water toward the Indiana shoreline at Clarksville. The
resulting erosion has caused the shoreline to recede 100 yards
to date. Indiana is quite literally losing pieces of our State
and our heritage to the river every single day due to the man-
made causes brought on by this Army Corps project.
The erosion threatens local businesses, roads, parks, and
historical sites, including the George Rogers Clark Homesite,
which marks the spot where Lewis and Clark first met and formed
the group that would begin their westward expedition.
While this problem has been brought to the attention of the
Army Corps of Engineers, and the Corps agrees and recognizes it
is a problem, it hasn't given it the attention that it
desperately needs. That is why, for this year's Water Resources
Development Act, I am requesting that the Army Corps of
Engineers prioritize completing the Clarksville Shoreline
Stabilization Project. Any further delay to this project risks
greater losses to our State, the local community, our
infrastructure, and our heritage.
Thank you again for allowing me the opportunity to speak on
this issue. I look forward to continuing to work with you and
your staff on stabilizing this shoreline and protecting this
important and historic area to the State of Indiana.
[Mrs. Houchin's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Erin Houchin, a Representative in Congress
From the State of Indiana
Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, thank you for hosting this
Member Day, and thank you for allowing me time to address you and the
Committee.
I'm here today to discuss an issue that has impacted my
constituents since long before I came to Congress--the erosion of the
Clarksville shoreline.
Since 1963--when current water flow practices started--the
redirection of the river has caused the shoreline to recede about 100
yards.
This erosion threatens local businesses, roads, projects, and
historical sites, including the George Rogers Clark Homesite, which
marks the spot where Lewis and Clark first met and formed the group
that would begin their westward expedition.
While this problem has been brought to the attention of the Army
Corps of Engineers, it hasn't received the attention it desperately
needs.
That is why for this year's Water Resources Development Act, I am
requesting that the Army Corps of Engineers focus on prioritizing and
completing the Clarksville shoreline stabilization project.
Any further delay to this project risks greater losses not only to
our state, the local community, and infrastructure--but also to our
heritage.
Thank you, again, for allowing me the opportunity to speak on this
issue today. I look forward to continuing to work with you and your
staff on stabilizing this shoreline and protecting this important
historical area.
I yield back the balance of my time.

Mrs. Houchin. I yield back the balance of my time.

TESTIMONY OF HON. DAN NEWHOUSE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

Mr. Newhouse. Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Members Napolitano
and Larsen, thank you for providing me the opportunity to
participate in today's hearing. I am here today to discuss
critical water resource issues impacting central Washington
which I believe should be addressed in the Water Resources
Development Act of 2024.
The policies, studies, and projects authorized by WRDA and
executed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers affect the daily
life of my neighbors and constituents in central Washington.
This includes locks and dams that enable navigation and boost
recreation; hydropower facilities that generate clean,
reliable, and efficient power; and levees that reduce the
impact of storms on our communities. Today I am going to
discuss urban canals of concern, the Othello Water Supply
Project, and the Lower Snake River Dams.
Back in November, I introduced the Urban Canal
Modernization Act. If enacted, this legislation would allow the
Bureau of Reclamation to authorize a 35-percent nonreimbursable
cost share to aid in repairing and rehabilitating urban canals
of concern, which are canals that run through urban areas that
could, upon failure, cause significant property damage or loss
of life. The arduous task of maintaining and modernizing our
outdated urban canal systems is necessary for the safety of our
local communities. I urge the committee to include the language
from this bill within WRDA.
Turning to the Othello Water Supply Project, in central
Washington, there is an increasing demand for water with a
corresponding limited supply. To address this issue, we must
diversify our water supply to alleviate environmental
challenges and stabilize water supplies that are vulnerable to
drought. The Othello Water Supply Project will do this by
creating an aquifer storage and recovery water treatment plant
aimed at conveying water underground, storing it, and then
recovering it for conventional use. I respectfully request the
committee support the authorization of new resources necessary
for the development of this project to ensure central
Washington has a reliable, long-term, clean water supply.
And lastly, most importantly, I want to turn to the
Columbia River System Operations, or the CRSO, and the Lower
Snake River Dams. Over the last several years, the Biden
administration, alongside dam-breaching advocates and several
indigenous sovereign nations, have engaged in litigation and
mediation over the CRSO. In December of 2023, this culminated
in a final package of actions and commitments from the
administration which, if implemented, will, in my opinion,
operationally and functionally breach the Lower Snake River
Dams, spur exorbitant ratepayer increases, and cause harm to
the salmon population.
The overall CRSO and especially the Lower Snake River Dams
provide immeasurable benefits to millions of Americans across
the Pacific Northwest, providing flood control and irrigation,
transportation of agricultural goods to our ports, baseload
renewable power, and much more. Recreationists, farmers, river-
dependent ports and communities, transportation stakeholders,
and electricity customers would be irreparably damaged if the
Lower Snake River Dams are breached. As such, I staunchly
oppose the inclusion of any language in WRDA which would
operationally or physically breach the Lower Snake River Dams,
as well as any aid for Federal agencies in implementing the
Columbia Basin Restoration Initiative.
In the coming days, I will be submitting my formal request
to the committee, and as you craft the base text for this
legislation in the months ahead, I encourage you to take these
vital interests into consideration.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Are there any questions
so far for the panelists we have heard from?
Seeing none, you are free to leave. We will certainly keep
all your testimony in mind.
Mr. Sorensen, you have up to 5 minutes when you are ready.

TESTIMONY OF HON. ERIC SORENSEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

Mr. Sorensen. Thank you. I want to begin by thanking
Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano for convening
this hearing and welcoming Member testimony today as you craft
the important legislation, the Water Resources Development Act
of 2024.
For every American, WRDA represents one of the best Federal
opportunities to respond to disasters, to protect our
waterways, and support clean water and healthy ecosystems.
I am proud to represent the 17th Congressional District of
Illinois. My district sits along the great Mississippi River,
and is home to dozens of agricultural communities that depend
on the Mississippi to move their goods to market. The Army
Corps of Engineers and local communities along the river work
hand in hand to maintain and upgrade river water
infrastructure.
Last year, I joined Chairman Graves in submitting a funding
request for the Navigational Ecosystem Sustainability Program,
or NESP, to the Appropriations Committee. I was proud to see
this program funded at $75 million in the House-drafted energy
and water appropriations bill. I thank Chairman Graves for
working with me on that request, and look forward to the
program receiving this round of funding, which would go toward
construction of lock and dam No. 25 on the upper Mississippi.
Part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was intended to
fund the construction of lock and dam 25 and 6 other projects
to completion. However, this funding is not sufficient to cover
the full cost. Without additional clarification from Congress,
completion of these products will be delayed as local funding
sources cannot cover the gap. I urge the committee to include
language in WRDA 2024 to clarify that all seven of these
projects be fully federally funded, as intended under the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
Many members of the committees we represent might not know
that WRDA offers more local support than funding for
infrastructure along the Mississippi River. Now, my district is
home to dozens of drinking water and wastewater agencies that
serve the people of central and northwestern Illinois. These
agencies are in need of funding to support necessary upgrades
and repairs to their systems to protect the communities and the
people that we serve. For this reason, I am pleased that the
committee will accept environmental infrastructure requests for
WRDA 2024.
The need for these authorizations is clear. For example, a
very small town, German Valley, Illinois, in my district, pays
$2,000 a month for chemical treatments to address contamination
in their wastewater lagoon because they can't afford a larger
infrastructure investment needed to address the problem head
on.
Now, the town of Savanna, Illinois, a community that is
underneath the bluffs of the Mississippi River, has an aging
drinking water pipe that is running underneath a very heavy and
old retaining wall. Now, should the wall crumble, or if the
pipe were to fail, half of the community of Savanna, Illinois,
would be without drinking water.
So, I look forward to submitting these and other worthy
projects for your consideration. So, thank you again to the
committee for the important opportunity to testify on these
important issues.
[Mr. Sorensen's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Eric Sorensen, a Representative in Congress
From the State of Illinois
I want to begin by thanking Chairman Graves and Ranking Member
Larsen for convening this hearing and for welcoming member testimony as
you craft this important legislation, the Water Resources Development
Act of 2024.
I am proud to represent the 17th district of Illinois. My district
sits along the upper Mississippi River and is home to dozens of
agricultural communities that depend on the Mississippi to move their
goods to market. The Army Corps of Engineers and local communities
along the Mississippi River work hand in hand to maintain and upgrade
river water infrastructure.
As part of this work, the Army Corps requires that the non-federal
sponsor, usually the state or local government, sign a project
partnership agreement, many of which include provisions requiring the
non-federal sponsor to take full responsibility for the operation,
maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation (OMRR&R) for the
infrastructure asset the Corps are constructing on the behalf of the
non-federal sponsor. I support a change to this standard practice
change that would allow the Corps and non-federal sponsor to enter into
agreements where the obligation of OMRR&R expires at a set date.
Staying with PPAs, the standard PPA the Corps stipulates that the
non-federal sponsor indemnify the federal government of any costs
associated with a catastrophe involving the infrastructure asset
constructed by the Corps. I support a modification to the current
blanket indemnification in favor of a shared approach to liability
costs.
As you all know, the authorization for the National Levee Safety
Program has expired. I support language to reauthorize this program in
WRDA 24.
I am supportive of the funding appropriated for the Inland
Waterways Construction Projects in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
which will fund the construction of seven water infrastructure assets
throughout the country. One of these projects is Lock and Dam 25 on the
Mississippi River.
The intent of the BIL funding was to fund these seven projects to
completion all using federal funds. Unfortunately, the costs for the
projects have increased and the appropriated funding is no longer
sufficient. I support the inclusion of language in WRDA to stipulate
that all seven projects have a 100% federal cost share.
Additionally, like many other members, my district is home to
dozens of drinking water and wastewater agencies that support the
people of Illinois' 17th Congressional district. One way WRDA supports
local communities is through Environmental Infrastructure
authorizations. I am pleased that the Committee will accept EI requests
for WRDA 24 and look forward to advocating for projects to support
infrastructure projects in the communities I represent.
I thank the Committee for the opportunity to testify on these
important issues.

Mr. Sorensen. And I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Are there any questions
for Mr. Sorensen?
Seeing none, I appreciate your testimony. You are free to
leave.
Mr. Sorensen. Thank you, Chairman.
Mr. Rouzer. Mrs. Fletcher, you are recognized for up to 5
minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. LIZZIE FLETCHER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS

Mrs. Fletcher. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As a former member of this committee, I am proud of and
excited about the work that we have done together and the
things that we have accomplished in the previous Water
Resources Development Acts, and I appreciate the opportunity to
come before you today and testify about my community's
priorities for water infrastructure investment in Houston,
Harris County, and Fort Bend County in the Water Resources
Development Act of 2024.
I have submitted to the committee several priorities,
including project-specific policy changes and authorizations,
and those with broader implications for how the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers operates. There are two main drivers of our
priorities, and I know they are priorities of this committee
and of this Congress: one, to make our communities safer and
more resilient through infrastructure investment; and two, to
support economic growth through infrastructure investment.
In that first category, I have asked for language to ensure
the Corps' continued focus on completing the Buffalo Bayou and
Tributaries Resiliency Study. Congress authorized this study
after Hurricane Harvey hit the gulf coast in 2017, killing at
least 68 people and causing more than $125 billion in damages.
The study focuses on the viability of different flood control
projects along Buffalo Bayou in my district, and the
surrounding Addicks and Barker Reservoirs.
Last Congress, I advocated for an extension of the study so
that the Corps would have time to be able to consider all
possible solutions fully. With financial support from Harris
County and the Corps, and with an extension granted, the study
continued. Now, as we face the need for an additional
extension, I urge the Corps to continue its focus and complete
this study so it can move forward with a project that aligns
with community objectives, minimizes adverse environmental and
community impacts, and prioritizes resilience.
Hurricane Harvey made landfall nearly 7 years ago. It is
crucial that we utilize the full expertise and resources of the
Corps to complete this study before our next Water Resources
Development Act in 2026.
The Buffalo Bayou and Tributaries Resiliency Study has been
possible because of the ongoing collaboration between the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, Harris County Flood Control District,
and local and Federal leaders, as well as the public. I look
forward to continuing this collaboration and finding resilient
water conveyance solutions for Houston, Harris County, Fort
Bend County, and all of our region.
In the second category of priorities, I have asked for
study authorization for the Houston Ship Channel's Project 12
and policy modifications so that ports and waterways can
maintain necessary depths and remain competitive in a global
marketplace.
As many on the committee may remember, I advocated for the
authorization of the Houston Ship Channel's Project 11 in the
Water Resources Development Act of 2020. This project widens
and deepens the Houston Ship Channel, promoting global trade at
the busiest port in the country by total tonnage. This project
is expected to be completed ahead of schedule next year.
While this is a cause for celebration, we must begin to
look ahead and look to the future and other deepening projects
to meet the growing size and depth of vessels using the port.
In order to begin the process, I have asked the committee to
authorize a study on project 12. Starting this process now will
ensure that our Federal investments are proactive and timely.
This critical project will impact not just the Houston region,
but the entire country.
I have submitted several other requests to the committee,
and I appreciate your consideration of these important
requests. I look forward to working with the committee on these
projects and much more, and to answering any questions that you
may have.

Mr. Carter, our great colleague from Georgia, you have up
to 5 minutes to present your testimony.

TESTIMONY OF HON. EARL L. ``BUDDY'' CARTER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA

Mr. Carter of Georgia. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and
Ranking Member, for this opportunity to address this committee.
I appreciate it very much. This is extremely important. Thank
you, and thank you for considering my testimony as the
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure continues its
work this Congress, especially with WRDA.
As the Representative of the entire coast of Georgia, over
100 miles of pristine coastline, WRDA is an extremely important
piece of legislation for my constituents. The U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers projects throughout our district have allowed us
to grow and prosper over the years.
The most significant project, of course, has been the
Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, SHEP, which has been an
extraordinary success story for our State and region. Completed
in March of 2022, SHEP deepened the Savannah Harbor to 47 feet
to allow larger ships from all around the globe to access the
Port of Savannah. This has allowed the Port of Savannah to be
the single largest and fastest growing container terminal in
America, in addition to being the second largest port on the
east coast by volume. In fiscal year 2022, it moved 5.8 million
20-foot-equivalent container units in throughput, an increase
of 8.1 percent when compared to the previous year.
None of this would have been possible without the work done
here on the T&I Committee and the authorizations for SHEP
through WRDA. I thank the committee for its continued support
for a project that is bringing true benefits to our country.
According to a Corps of Engineers study, the project is
expected to net more than $291 million in annual benefits to
the Nation, or approximately $7.70 for every dollar invested in
the project.
Georgia's deepwater ports and inland barge terminals
support nearly 561,000 jobs throughout the State annually and
contribute $33 billion in income, $140 billion in sales, and
$3.8 billion in State and local taxes to Georgia's economy.
However, for all the benefits this project has already
brought, the world is changing rapidly and ships continue to
only get bigger and bigger. That is why I am asking for the
committee to include authorization for a new feasibility study
or modification to an existing study authorization to examine
the benefit of both widening and deepening the harbor of the
Port of Savannah to better accommodate today's commercial
demands and to prepare for meeting tomorrow's trade needs.
The recently completed dredging under SHEP was designed for
vessels with an 8,200 TEU capacity, and the Port of Savannah is
currently accommodating ships holding more than 16,000 TEUs on
a tightly restricted basis. With the Georgia Department of
Transportation raising the height of the Talmadge Bridge, the
Port of Savannah's air draft capacity increases significantly,
opening the door to serve even larger vessels and increase its
significant positive impact on America's economy.
My next request for the committee is for Tybee Island,
which sits down the river from the Port of Savannah and is an
important barrier island for our coast. While the growth of the
Port of Savannah has been welcome, the Federal channel has
directly contributed to the erosion on the island and is in
persistent need of renourishment. That is why I am requesting
authorization for a new feasibility study incorporating the
results of the channel impact study that would lead to the
development of a project to adequately solve or mitigate the
erosion of Tybee Island's beaches.
Next, I would like to request that the committee consider
the authorization of a GAO study on the benefits of digital
project delivery for the U.S. Army Corps. With the savings that
digital infrastructure tools provide and the hundreds of
different projects that the Corps engages in each year around
the country, digital infrastructure technologies are cloud-
based, open-data computer platforms that integrate digital
technology throughout the life cycle of an infrastructure
asset.
These technologies are proven and utilized around the world
for infrastructure projects to reduce project costs, accelerate
project delivery, and build more innovative, resilient, and
sustainable assets, including water infrastructure projects.
Such a study should hopefully demonstrate the savings that
digital infrastructure tools can provide to the hundreds of
different studies and projects that the Corps engages in each
year around the country.
Lastly, I ask the committee to provide Environmental
Infrastructure Assistance Authority for the coastal Georgia
counties of Bryan, Camden, Chatham, Effingham, Glynn, and
McIntosh. Under WRDA, the U.S. Army Corps is authorized to
provide assistance with design and construction of
infrastructure in specific municipalities, counties, and
States. This assistance supports publicly owned and operated
facilities such as water distribution works, stormwater
collection, and environmental restoration, among others. Adding
authority for these counties would provide an opportunity to
help these communities with some of their drinking, stormwater,
wastewater, and other flooding problems.
Thank you again for your time and your consideration of
these important issues for my district, the State, and the
country. I look forward to continuing to work with the
committee to ensure the inclusion of these requests that will
bring significant benefits to our communities and to our
country.

With the Georgia DOT raising the height of the Talmadge Bridge, the
Port of Savannah's air draft capacity increases significantly--opening
the door to serve even larger vessels and increase its significant
positive impact on America's economy.
My next request for the Committee is for Tybee Island, which sits
down river from the Port of Savannah and is an important barrier island
for our coast. While the growth of the Port of Savannah has been
welcome, the federal channel has directly contributed to erosion on the
island and are in persistent need of renourishment.
That is why I am requesting authorization for a new feasibility
study, incorporating the results of the Channel Impact Study, that
would lead to the development of a project to adequately solve or
mitigate the erosion of Tybee Island's beaches.
Next, I would like to request that the Committee consider the
authorization of a GAO on the benefits of digital project delivery for
the US Army Corps. With the savings that digital infrastructure tools
provide and the hundreds of different studies and projects that the
Corps engages in each year around the country.
Digital infrastructure technologies are cloud based, open data,
computer platforms that integrate digital technology throughout the
lifecycle of an infrastructure asset.
These technologies are proven and utilized around the world for
infrastructure projects to reduce project costs, accelerate project
delivery, and build more innovative, resilient, and sustainable assets,
including water infrastructure projects.
Today, digital infrastructure technologies are used by all 50 state
Departments of Transportation, the U.S. Department of Transportation,
the Federal Highway Administration, and owner-operators of critical
infrastructure throughout the country.
Such a study should hopefully demonstrate the savings that digital
infrastructure tools can provide to the hundreds of different studies
and projects that the Corps engages in each year around the country.
Lastly, I ask that the Committee to provide Environmental
Infrastructure Assistance authority for the coastal Georgia counties of
Bryan, Camden, Chatham, Effingham, Glynn, and McIntosh.
Under WRDA, the US Army Corps is authorized to provide assistance
with design and construction of infrastructure in specified
municipalities, counties, and states. This assistance supports publicly
owned and operated facilities, such as water distribution works,
stormwater collection, surface water protection projects, and
environmental restoration, among others.
This environmental infrastructure is becoming increasingly
important in our district as we experience significant growth from the
activity at the Ports that I've already mentioned and new manufacturing
coming to the area.
Adding authority for Bryan, Camden, Chatham, Effingham, Glynn, and
McIntosh would provide an opportunity to help these communities with
some of their drinking, stormwater, wastewater, and other flooding
problems.
Thank you for your time and consideration of these important issues
for my district, state, and the country.
I look forward to continuing to work with the Committee to ensure
the inclusion of these requests that will bring significant benefits to
our communities and country.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman for his testimony. Are
there any questions?
Seeing none, thank you again.
Mr. Donalds, great to see you here. I look forward to your
testimony. You have up to 5 minutes when you are ready.

TESTIMONY OF HON. BYRON DONALDS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

Mr. Donalds. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer, Vice Chair
Napolitano. Thank you for being here. Thank you for allowing me
to be here. I want to discuss three topics with you today:
number one, water quality; number two, transportation; and
number three, nuclear energy.
I represent Florida's 19th Congressional District, which
covers Lee County and Collier County of southwest Florida. My
district is full of environmental treasures such as white sandy
beaches, lakes, rivers, streams, creeks, not to mention a wide
variety of unique aquatic specimens that call these water
bodies home. The quality of the water impacts my constituents
and the local economy on a daily basis, hence why water is my
office's number-one priority.
I want to make the committee aware of a few bills that I am
leading to improve water quality in my district and across the
United States of America.
First, I introduced the Water Quality and Environmental
Innovation Act on a bipartisan basis with Representative
Gottheimer of New Jersey. This bill takes unused funding that
lacks a designated purpose from the EPA's Motor Vehicle and
Engine Compliance Program for the purpose of issuing grants and
contracts to fund projects that seek to use emerging
technologies to combat water quality and other related
challenges. Innovative technologies may include artificial
intelligence, robotics, distributed ledger technology, eDNA,
quantum, et cetera.
This bill takes an outside-the-box approach to remedy
potential water quality concerns such as harmful algal blooms,
sea level rise, acidification, accumulation of trash and
plastics, et cetera.
Next, I previously introduced another bipartisan bill
called the Combat Harmful Algal Blooms Act. This bill is
simple. It adds harmful algal blooms to be eligible for major
disaster funding under the Stafford Act. To illustrate the
importance of this to Lee County's economy, Lee County's
fishing industry has a value of $618 million. An economic loss
from harmful algal blooms can equate to $195 million. Lee
County's coastal economic output is $11.1 billion. Harmful
algal blooms can cost my area $3 billion. Lee County's property
values near the coast is roughly $19.1 billion. Economic losses
from harmful algal blooms can equate to $3.8 billion.
I would also note that I am introducing a bill in the near
future called the Convert Harmful Algal Blooms to Fuels Act,
which is another bill that takes a unique approach to combating
Florida's water quality challenges. Briefly, this bill builds
upon the Army Corps HABITATS Program to take aquatic algal
biomass and convert such algae into alternative fuels or
biofuels. As a Floridian, I welcome an opportunity to turn
oranges into orange juice, and this bipartisan bill actually
would incorporate a similar train of thought.
Next, I would urge the committee to consider another
bipartisan bill I introduced called the Short Line Railroad
Relief Act. There are approximately 600 short line freight
railroads in the United States, most being owned and operated
by small businesses. The Seminole Gulf Railway is the one that
is in southwest Florida, in Congressional District 19. This was
actually subject to damage from Hurricane Ian, so, time is of
the essence to try to repair that railway line so that our
local economy can get back on track as quickly as possible.
Finally, I have introduced several bills related to nuclear
energy in this Congress. A few of them have been referred to
your committee chairman. Nuclear is the cleanest option in
America's energy arsenal. Nuclear is a bipartisan issue. I know
a lot of our colleagues up here on Capitol Hill have a desire
to release or eliminate carbon emissions; nuclear power is the
engine to make that a reality and take it from the talking
points to something that is tangible for all Americans.
Specifically, I introduced a bill that will require the
development of a national strategy to deploy nuclear
microreactors after natural disasters hit.
Finally, I would like to leave the committee with this
innovative thought. Across the street from this hearing room is
the U.S. Capitol Power Plant. The facility provides chilled
water and high-temperature steam to the Capitol complex. Today,
we are seeing many of these coal facilities being retired, and
unfortunately, there is currently a huge opportunity to
revitalize retired coal facilities with advanced nuclear
technology due to the compatibility of such energy
infrastructure.
Now imagine the statement Congress could make to the
nuclear industry, American communities, and the world if we
look at utilizing advanced nuclear power reactors to power the
United States Capitol. I think it would send an amazing message
of what Congress is prepared to do, and how we can lead the
United States and the world.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Byron Donalds, a Representative in Congress
From the State of Florida

Thanks for the invitation to testify

Three topics that I want to discuss today
1.  Water Quality
2.  Transportation
3.  Nuclear Energy
1.  I represent Florida's 19th District which covers Lee and
Collier County, in Southwest Florida.

My district is full of environmental treasures--such as
white sandy beaches, lakes, rivers, streams, creeks--not to mention the
wide variety of unique aquatic specimens that call these water bodies
home.

The quality of water impacts my constituents and our
local economy on a daily basis

Hence why water is my office's number one priority

I want to make the Committee aware of a few bills that
I'm leading to improve water quality in my district and around the
United States
1.a.  First, I introduced the Water Quality & Environmental
Innovation Act on a bipartisan basis with Rep. Gottheimer from New
Jersey.

This bill takes unused funding that lacks a designated
purpose from EPA's Motor Vehicle and Engine Compliance Program for the
purpose of issuing grants and contracts to fund projects that seek to
use emerging technologies to combat water quality related-challenges.

Innovative technologies may include: artificial
intelligence, robotics, distributed ledger technology, eDNA, quantum,
etc.

This bill takes an outside-the-box approach to remedy
potential water quality concerns, such as:

Harmful algal blooms, sea-level rise, acidification,
accumulation of trash and plastics, etc.

[Urge the Committee to consider this bill]
1.b.  Next, I previously introduced another bipartisan bill called
the Combat Harmful Algal Blooms Act.

This bill is simple: it adds ``harmful algal blooms''
to be eligible for major disaster funding under the Stafford Act.

[Illustrate the economic impacts of HABs in Lee
County, FL]

Lee County Fishing industry=$618 million value

Economic loss expected from a HAB=$195 million

Lee County Coastal Economic Output=$11.1 billion

Economic loss expected from a HAB=$3 billion.

Lee County Property Value Near the Coast=$19.1
billion

Economic loss expected from a HAB=$3.8 billion.

The economics of HABs speak for themselves

Providing federal major disaster funding to recover
from severe HAB outbreaks will be vital for my district in the years to
come

Plus this bill doesn't automatically allocate
disaster funding for every harmful algal bloom, but instead allows FEMA
to consider allocating funding based on the individual HAB
circumstance.

Plus, this bill is broadly cosponsored by 15 bipartisan
members of the Florida delegation.

[Urge the Committee to consider this bill]
1.c.  Also to note, I'll be introducing a bill in the near future
called the Convert HABs to Fuel Act--which is another bill that takes
aunique approach to combating FL's water quality challenges.

Briefly, this bill builds upon the Army Corps.'
``HABITATS'' program to take aquatic algae biomass and convert such
algae into alternative fuels (biofuels).

As a Floridian, I welcome any opportunity to turn oranges
into orange juice--and this bill incorporates a similar train of
thought.

[CP COMMENT: PLAY ON ``MAKING LEMONADE OUT OF LEMONS'']
2.a.  Next, I urge the committee to consider another bipartisan
bill I introduced called the Short Line Railroad Relief Act.

There are approximately 600 short line freight railroads
in the United States--most being owned & operated by small businesses.

Seminole Gulf Railway is FL-19's only short line

This specific short line railroad suffered
``catastrophic damage'' following Hurricane Ian

Time is of the essence after a disaster hits, and this
bill authorizes a program for the DOT Secretary to issue grants &
contracts to expeditiously provide much-needed capital to repair
severely damaged rail infrastructure & equipment.

[Urge the Committee to consider this bill]
3.  Finally, I've introduced several bills relating to nuclear
energy this Congress--a few that have been referred to your Committee.

Nuclear is the cleanest energy option in America's energy
arsenal

Nuclear is a bipartisan issue
3.a.  Specifically, I introduced a bill that would require the
development of a national strategy to deploy nuclear microreactors
after natural disasters hit.

FL-19 knows all about natural disasters

In addition to diesel generators, it would be
beneficial to have the option to utilize portable microreactors as well

We must proactively plan for the deployment of this
next-generation nuclear technology

[Urge the Committee to consider this bill]
3.b.  Finally, I'd like to leave the Committee with this innovative
thought:

Across the street from this hearing room is the U.S.
Capitol Power Plant.

This facility provides chilled water and high-
temperature steam to the U.S. Capitol Complex.

Many don't know that this facility previously was
powered by coal.

Today, we're seeing many coal facilities being retired
(unfortunately), and there's currently a huge opportunity to revitalize
retired coal facilities with advanced nuclear technology due to the
compatibility of such energy infrastructure.

Now imagine the statement Congress could make to the
nuclear industry, American communities, and the world if we look into
utilizing advanced nuclear reactors to power the United States Capitol.

In fact, I have a bill that would look into the
feasibility of doing just that (called the U.S. Capitol Power Plant
Retrofit Act).

[Urge the Committee to consider this bill]

Thank you Chairman Graves for considering my legislative
initiatives.

Mr. Donalds. And I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Are there any questions?
Seeing none, thank you again.
The committee will go into a brief recess.
[Recess.]
Mr. Rouzer. The committee will come back to order.
Mr. Mullin, we will start with you whenever you are ready.
You have up to 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. KEVIN MULLIN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

Mr. Mullin. Thank you, Mr. Chair, Members, for the
opportunity.
On New Year's Eve of 2022, my home State of California saw
firsthand the dangers of climate change. Unprecedented flooding
from several atmospheric rivers wreaked havoc, causing damage
to private property, public infrastructure, and disrupting the
lives of many of my constituents, including on their private
property. District residents in the city of San Mateo, who
really have never experienced storms quite like this, are now
facing catastrophic losses. To quote one constituent regarding
their experience, ``I've lived in San Mateo for 33 years, and
where we lived has never, ever flooded . . . about 4 hours
[after it started], I was, in vain, attempting to bail out my
house.''
The data shows we need to address flooding in my district
to address the frequency of these so-called 100-year flood
events. That is why I have respectfully submitted to the
committee a request for a feasibility study of flood control
and stormwater runoff reduction measures to be taken in San
Mateo. These efforts will protect this city from future extreme
weather events.
Frankly, we know this is a problem nationwide. Communities
everywhere are finding it challenging to work within the
authorized dollar amounts for continuing authority programs. A
commonsense policy change that I am submitting to the committee
is to modestly adjust these amounts for inflation and regional
cost differences. This adjustment would better support projects
across the country, including in my own district, where there
is also an ongoing effort to protect the bayfront city of East
Palo Alto and the San Francisquito Creek, which runs right
through that community. This project, if funded properly, would
significantly reduce the risk of flooding for over 4,000
households.
Please consider the impact these requests will have on the
way communities across the country respond to extreme weather.
Thank you for your time and for your work on this year's act.
[Mr. Mullin's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Kevin Mullin, a Representative in Congress
From the State of California
Thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, for inviting
me here today, I'm grateful for your audience.
On New Year's Eve of 2022, my home state of California saw
firsthand the real danger of climate change. Unprecedented flooding
from several atmospheric rivers wreaked havoc throughout my district,
causing damage to private property, public infrastructure, and
disrupting the lives of many of my constituents.
For example, in the City of San Mateo, residents who have never
experienced storms like this in the past are now facing catastrophic
losses. To quote one constituent regarding their experience after one
of the latest storms began: ``I've lived in San Mateo for 33 years, and
where we lived has never, ever flooded . . . about four hours [after it
started], I was, in vain, attempting to bail out my house.''
We know from the data that we need to address flooding in our
community now. That is why I have respectfully submitted to the
Committee a request for a feasibility study of flood control and
stormwater runoff reduction measures that might be taken in San Mateo.
These efforts will protect this city from the increased threat of
extreme weather events.
But zooming out, we know this is a problem across the country.
Moreover, communities are finding it challenging to work within the
authorized dollar amounts for continuing authority programs. A common

for the gentleman?
Seeing none, thank you again for your testimony.

TESTIMONY OF HON. ANNA PAULINA LUNA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

Mrs. Luna. Thank you. My district is home to many pristine
beaches along the Gulf of Mexico. It is my utmost priority to
ensure beach renourishment continues in my community, and that
is exactly why I am here before you today.
For the entirety of last year, my office has begun fighting
with the Army Corps of Engineers over their decision to not
move forward with the renourishment of the Sand Key Beach
Project in Pinellas County. The initial construction effort for
Sand Key was completed in 1993. Successive renourishment took
place in 1999, 2006, 2012, and 2018, and they have
significantly repaired the beach and also built up the
shoreline to up to 200 feet from the seawall.
Renourishment needs to take place every 6 years in order
for this area to be maintained. However, the Army Corps has
informed Pinellas County that local officials must obtain over
100 percent of property owner rights in order for a beach
access to take place. This is obviously not fair, being that we
can't even at this current time attain over 40 percent.
Despite perpetual easements not being required by law, the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers insists that it must acquire all
access in order to move forward, and this is also impacting the
areas of Treasure Island and Long Key.
For previous renourishments, Pinellas County property
owners were allowed to sign temporary construction easements to
allow the Army Corps to do its work. Army Corps also stated
that the agency intends to start enforcing its new policy--
purportedly from 1996, but not enforced over the last two
decades.
Section 103(d) of the 1986 Water Resources Development Act,
WRDA, requires the local sponsors to pay for sand placed on
private property. The Army Corps of Engineers' new
interpretation of this 40-year-old law is that they will not
replace the public side of the sand, which is seaward of the
erosion control line, unless perpetual public access is
acquired from property owner rights on the landward side of the
erosion control line in order for local sponsors to pay 100
percent of the cost.
Basically, this policy is out of date. What is happening is
our communities impacted by it, they are citing a policy that
hasn't been enforced for over 20 years, and now they are saying
that if we don't basically hand over our private property
rights, what is going to happen is we are not going to get
help. It is going to impact our tourism. It is going to
basically ensure that these property owners are going to have
their property completely destroyed, not to mention we have
natural habitat for some endangered species that is also going
to be impacted by it.
The Army Corps has been playing games. We have been trying
to reach out to them. They haven't responded to any of our
phone calls. I know that I am not the only Member that is
facing this problem. They are doing this to other Members, as
well. And I find it ironic that it is also in red States. So, I
am asking for your help to change this policy so that they can
no longer do this to our community.
[Mrs. Luna's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Anna Paulina Luna, a Representative in
Congress From the State of Florida
Hello Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and distinguished
Members of the Committee.
My district is home to many pristine beaches along the Gulf of
Mexico. It is my utmost priority to ensure beach renourishment
continues in my community. That is why I am before you today.
For the entirety of last year, my office has been fighting the Army
Corps of Engineers over their decision not to move forward with the
renourishment of the Sand Key Beach Project in Pinellas County. The
initial construction effort for Sand Key was completed in 1993.
Successive nourishments in 1999, 2006, 2012, and 2018 have
significantly repaired and built up the beach, with the shoreline now
about 200 feet from the seawall. Renourishment needs to be placed every
six years. The next renourishment cycle would need to begin in 2024 to
stay on schedule and not risk beach erosion that would degrade the
progress made over the last three decades.
However, the Army Corps has informed Pinellas County that local
officials must obtain perpetual public access easements along the
length of the project from 100 percent of property owners, regardless
of whether sand is being placed on their private property, in order to
proceed with the next renourishment cycle. This attempted power grab
seeks to strip property rights from homeowners where easements are not
needed to complete the next renourishment cycle.
Despite perpetual easements not being required by law, the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers insists they must be acquired to move forward
with ANY beach renourishment project. This now affects not only Sand
Key but also Treasure Island and Long Key projects, which were
previously given the green light in Pinellas County. It does not end
there; the Corps' policy will halt beach renourishment projects in over
nine counties throughout Florida.
For previous nourishments, Pinellas County property owners were
allowed to sign temporary construction easements to allow the Army
Corps to do its work. Army Corps stated that the agency intends to
start enforcing this new policy, purportedly from 1996 but not enforced
for the past two decades. It is a flawed requirement to require
perpetual public access easements on private properties, especially
those that will not have sand placed. For obvious reasons about half of
private property owners have declined to give such an easement.
Section 103(d) of the 1986 Water Resources Development Act (WRDA)
requires the local sponsor to pay for sand placed on private property.
The Army Corps of Engineers new interpretation of this 40-year-old law
is that they will not place sand on the public side of the beach, which
is seaward of the erosion control line, unless a perpetual public
access easement is acquired from the private property owners on the
landward side of the erosion control line unless the local sponsor pays
100% of the cost. The Army Corps ridiculously maintains this position
even when sand is not being placed in front of the private property.
The Corps cites section 103d of 1986 WRDA, which prohibits federal
funding of benefits to privately owned shores where use is limited to
private interest, as the reason for their unattainable perpetual
easement policy. The Corps does not take into account that beaches in
Florida are already public beaches, established by the erosion control
line, and that beach renourishment projects with temporary construction
easements do not violate 1986 WRDA.
The Corps is interpreting the law incorrectly to fit their policy
wants, not, as they claim, to comply with the law. Therefore, we need
to clarify in existing law that the Corps cannot abuse its power with
this interpretation and stretch its interpretation of the law with no
legal or statutory authority to do so.
We must rein in the Army Corps of Engineers and modify the
requirements in WRDA relating to easements for beach renourishment
projects and measures in the State of Florida. This policy
clarification would state that a public access or use easement or
perpetual property right shall not be required to be provided for any
privately owned land that is located landward of the erosion control
line (as determined by the State of Florida) and that the Corps may
only require a temporary easement or other property right to be
provided for the purpose of performing pre-construction, construction,
or post construction activities for the project of measure (including
maintenance and monitoring activities).
The Corps' one size fits all approach regarding their easement
policy does not take into account the vast differences in state laws
when it comes to public versus private property. For instance, Florida
law has an erosion control line that delineates public beach versus
private land. For the purposes of federal cost sharing, Florida's
beaches are already considered publicly accessible shores which satisfy
the WRDA 1986 requirement.
Without renourishment, Pinellas County will be more prone to future
hurricanes and flood damage, which will negatively impact the entire
county's economy. Without this scheduled 2024 nourishment, the beach
will dissipate and erode, demolishing many habitats to endangered
species and threatened wildlife. Specifically, Loggerhead Sea Turtles,
Piping Plover Shorebird, West Indian Manatee, Eastern Black Rail, Red
Knot, Wood Stork, American Crocodile, Eastern Indigo Snake, Green Sea
Turtle, Hawksbill Sea Turtle, and the Leatherback Sea Turtle are
federally classified as endangered or threatened species and reside in
and/or around the Sand Key region. Without renourishment to preserve
the habitats of our endangered species, they will be placed at greater
risk. The Army Corps is under an obligation to exercise its authority
to further the conservation of endangered and threatened species. In
this case, Army Corps action that reimagines the 1986 WRDA statute will
devastate such species.
It is my top priority for WRDA 2024 to ensure that Army Corps
proceeds as planned with already authorized beach renourishment
projects in Florida. While this new Army Corps policy is very personal
to me and my constituents in Pinellas County, I'm sure you will hear
from my colleagues that this new policy is threatening many other
projects throughout Florida. I respectfully request your assistance in
correcting the wayward Army Corps of Engineers and ensure that Florida
beach renourishment projects move forward on schedule.
Thank you. I yield back.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentlelady.
Mrs. Luna. Thank you.
Mr. Rouzer. Duly noted.
Are there any questions?
Seeing none, thank you again.
Mrs. Luna. Thank you.

TESTIMONY OF HON. NICK LaLOTA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK

Mr. LaLota. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member
Napolitano, for hosting this important hearing today and for
allowing me to testify in front of the committee. I would like
to take some time today to address two issues.
First, an issue critical to my district back home on Long
Island: reauthorizing the Long Island Sound Program. In 1985,
Congress created the Long Island Sound Study, also commonly
referred to as the Long Island Sound Program, to identify and
address the major environmental and ecological problems
affecting the Long Island Sound. The Long Island Sound Program
was authorized at $40 million annually through the Long Island
Sound Restoration Act, and through this legislation, a bi-state
comprehensive management plan has been developed and continues
to be implemented.
In 2006, Congress also passed the Long Island Sound
Stewardship Act, which provided Federal dollars to projects to
restore the coastal habitat to help revitalize the wildlife
population, coastal wetlands, and plant life.
In 2018, the Long Island Sound Restoration and Stewardship
Act, which combined and reauthorized the two complementary
water quality and habitat restoration programs, was enacted as
part of the America's Water Infrastructure Act.
As of 2022, Federal funding for the Long Island Sound has
enabled programs to significantly reduce the amount of nitrogen
entering the Long Island Sound from sewage treatment plants by
70.3 percent compared to the 1990s, reduce hypoxic conditions
by 58 percent compared to the 1990s, restore at least 2,239
acres of coastal habitat, and fund 570 conservation projects.
In fiscal year 2023, the Long Island Sound received $40
million, the largest funding level in the history of the
program. The House and Senate have both included $40 million
for the Long Island Sound in their fiscal year 2024
appropriations bills, and we are extremely grateful for that.
But none of this matters unless the program is
reauthorized.
And while my good friend from the other side of the aisle
and the other side of the Long Island Sound, Connecticut
Congressman Courtney, and I have introduced legislation, H.R.
5441, the Long Island Sound Restoration and Stewardship
Reauthorization Act of 2023, to reauthorize the program, we
believe this legislation can and should be included in a WRDA
package. I look forward to continuing to work with this
committee to get this important program reauthorized, and thank
you for the support that you have already shown.
The second issue I wanted to address quite quickly is an
issue of local concern that has been going on in my district
for quite some time: a crumbling seawall in the village of
Asharoken. The village of Asharoken connects the community of
Eaton's Neck to the rest of the town of Huntington through a
narrow road. Due to weather conditions and the elevation of the
road, there are several times when the road has completely
flooded, leaving stranded entire communities.
A brief survey of the seawall recently demonstrated a
devastating scouring of the beach, and with every storm, the
situation has become more and more dire for the local residents
there. This has resulted in toe stones dropping, exposure of
more sheet steel, and exposing the wall to total failure. This
could result in total loss of the road, as well. Currently,
there is redtape that is preventing the residents of Asharoken
and Eaton's Neck from getting the help they need to fortify the
seawall and ensure the community is not stranded when even a
minor weather event occurs.
I look forward, Chairman, Ranking Member, to working with
this committee and the Army Corps of Engineers to find a
solution to this issue, and I hope you would agree that my
constituents deserve nothing less. Thank you so much for your
indulgence.

2024 appropriations bills, and we are extremely grateful for that.
But none of this matters if the program is not reauthorized.
While my good friend and colleague from Connecticut, Mr. Courtney
and I have introduced legislation, H.R. 5441, the Long Island Sound
Restoration and Stewardship Reauthorization Act of 2023 to reauthorize
the program, we believe this legislation can and should be included in
a WRDA (pronounced: WERDA) package. I look forward to continuing to
work with this Committee to get this important program reauthorized and
I thank you for the support you have already shown.
I also wanted to take just a few moments to highlight a critical
local issue that has been going on in my district for quite some time--
a crumbling seawall in the village of Asharoken.
The village of Asharoken connects the community of Eaton's Neck and
the rest of the town of Huntington through a narrow road. Due to
weather conditions and the elevation of the road, there are several
times when the road has completely flooded--leaving stranded an entire
community.
A brief survey of the seawall recently demonstrated devastating
scouring of the beach. With every storm, the situation has become more
and more dire. This has resulted in the toe stones dropping, exposure
of more sheet steel and exposing the wall to total failure. This could
result in the loss of the road as well.
Currently, there is red tape that is preventing the residents of
Asharoken and Eaton's Neck from getting the help they need to fortify
the seawall and ensure that the community is not stranded when a minor
weather event occurs.
I look forward to working with this Committee and the Army Corps of
Engineers to find a solution to this issue. My constituents deserve
nothing less.
Thank you again to Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano
for hosting this hearing today and I yield back.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Are there any questions?
Seeing none, thank you again.
Mr. LaLota. Thank you.
Mr. Rouzer. Ms. Schrier, you are up for up to 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. KIM SCHRIER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

Dr. Schrier. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Ranking
Member.
I first want to thank the committee for their work on WRDA
in 2022. During the last WRDA Member Day, I spoke to this
committee about the importance of continued funding of the
Howard Hanson Dam, a project that the entire Washington
delegation supports that will provide downstream fish passage,
safe drinking water, and critical habitat restoration for
endangered salmon species. We were able to include
authorization of the necessary funds for project completion in
the 2022 WRDA, so, thank you for that work.
Today, I would like to speak with you first about my
bipartisan bill, the WIFIA Amendments of 2023. As you know, the
Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program, or
WIFIA, is a Federal credit program managed by Federal agencies
for eligible water and wastewater infrastructure projects.
Under this program, borrowers, including State, Tribal, and
Federal Governments, can apply for low-interest, flexible loans
to fund these water infrastructure projects. These loans are
invaluable resources that allow local governments to meet the
infrastructure needs of their respective communities at an
affordable rate.
WIFIA allotments have had a significant impact throughout
the country, and to date, the program has announced $19 billion
to finance 109 projects across the country, creating 60,000
jobs. In Washington State, King County, the city of Tacoma, and
Seattle public utilities have all received WIFIA loans. King
County was invited to apply for a $287 million WIFIA master
agreement, which helped fund several projects, including the
Northwest Lake Sammamish Interceptor Upgrade and the Sammamish
Plateau Diversion Project.
Now, despite its importance and its significant impact on
water infrastructure, the program has not been modified since
its inception in 2014. In addition to reauthorizing the program
through 2027, my bipartisan bill would update and improve WIFIA
by removing barriers of entry for rural community water
projects. This is an exciting and important opportunity to help
rural communities access critical loans and long-term, stable
funding for water infrastructure. This keeps our water clean,
ensures a supply of safe drinking water, keeps costs low for
ratepayers, and is particularly important for the smallest
communities. So, I request that this bill be considered by this
committee in the 2024 WRDA, or at least in future committee
activity.
With my remaining time, I would like to speak in support of
one particular project that I will be submitting for the city
of Chelan in my district. To paint a picture of the city of
Chelan, it is mountains with one of the deepest lakes in the
entire world right in the middle. The problem is that in 2015,
Washington experienced the worst wildfire season in the State's
recorded history, and this included the Chelan Complex fires.
It is smack in the middle of what we consider one of the
highest risk firesheds in the country. This destroyed 75 homes
and businesses nearby, and the risk of similar fires is only
increasing.
So, seeing a serious gap in wildfire preparedness, the city
of Chelan has proposed constructing a water reservoir at a
higher elevation for both wildfire resilience and for water
supply. The current system relies on booster pump stations to
distribute water over increasing elevation and distance from
the lake. The system contains some serious risks. Failure of
these pump stations, which can happen in a wildfire, could
disrupt water distribution to the eastern side of the city and
could impact firefighting abilities.
To counter this vulnerability, the city seeks to build a
new 1-million-gallon water reservoir in East Chelan. The
reservoir will assist in mitigating future wildfire risks
associated with their unique geographic and infrastructure
challenges, and I will be submitting an authorization request
for $9 million for the construction phase of this project.
I want to thank you for your consideration, and I am happy
to answer any questions.

TESTIMONY OF HON. NIKKI BUDZINSKI, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

Ms. Budzinski. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer, and thank you,
Ranking Member Napolitano, for holding this hearing today, to
hear from Members on our priorities for the upcoming
reauthorization of WRDA.
As a Representative for central and southern Illinois, I
have the honor of serving communities outside of St. Louis in
the Metro East region, communities that have struggled with the
consequences of inadequate infrastructure for far too long. In
Cahokia Heights, local residents have been dealing with a
flooding, sewage, and drinking water crisis for decades,
eroding home values and putting folks' health and safety at
risk.
I was proud to secure an EPA coordinator to help us resolve
this issue, and the Army Corps of Engineers has worked
collaboratively with the State of Illinois to address this in
the past. But our work is not done, and that is why I am
requesting additional support in our next Water Resources
Development Act.
In WRDA 2024, I am requesting a feasibility study of the
Spring Lake Project recommended in the East St. Louis and
Vicinity Ecosystem Restoration and Flood Damage Reduction
Project report to advance this structural project to a
preconstruction engineering design phase. This will help
communities in my district with flood resilience and reduction,
and ensure their homes are protected.
In addition to completing this study, the flooding issue
can be mitigated by modifying the scope and authorization
ceiling for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers response. By
adding stormwater management to the existing scope of water and
wastewater infrastructure assistance, the Army Corps of
Engineers will have increased ability to remedy flooding issues
as they arise, as well as mitigate future issues. Raising the
ceiling from $100 to $200 million will also allow the Army
Corps enhanced capability to respond to these issues.
The Mississippi River also serves as a vital waterway to
growers and producers in my congressional district, allowing
them to get their goods to market. The Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law funded seven inland waterway construction
projects. Even so, Infrastructure Law funds alone will be
insufficient to complete any of these critical projects that
Congress intended the IIJA fund to complete. Unless modified in
WRDA 2024, the disparity between projected costs reflected in
BIL funding levels and subsequent real-world project costs
threaten to jeopardize and delay critical ongoing and planned
capital improvements that are desperately and urgently needed
to modernize our Nation's antiquated inland waterways
transportation system, further delaying economic and
environmental benefits.
Consistent with IIJA congressional intent, I request that
we adjust funding levels to ensure that the Federal Government
continues to cover 100 percent of the cost of the seven inland
waterways construction and major rehabilitation projects. The
requests I highlighted today alongside the others I intend to
submit to the committee will help ensure that the constituents
in my district are protected from floods; that the Army Corps
of Engineers is well equipped to address flooding issues; and
that our waterways construction and rehabilitation
infrastructure is fully funded.
Thank you very much, Chairman and Ranking Member, for the
opportunity to testify here today, and I thank you in advance
for consideration of my request. Thank you.
[Ms. Budzinski's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Nikki Budzinski, a Representative in
Congress From the State of Illinois
Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony before the
Transportation & Infrastructure Committee as part of the Water
Resources Development Act (WRDA) Member Day. Below are the top three
requests I plan to submit for your consideration as you continue your
work on this important reauthorization.
The State of Illinois and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
St. Louis District has a history of working collaboratively on flood
mitigation efforts in the East St. Louis Metropolitan Area. Studies
sponsored by both the State of Illinois and USACE in 1957, 1965, 1976
and 1985 have yielded mixed results, with some projects suggested by
the studies being implemented, while other projects were deemed
uneconomical based on conditions at that time.
The WRDA 2000 authorized the USACE to perform a General
Reevaluation Report of the 1965 Flood Control Act to include ecosystem
restoration as a project purpose. The 2000 WRDA authorization resulted
in the East St. Louis, and Vicinity, Illinois Ecosystem Restoration and
Flood Damage Reduction Project report which was published in 2003. The
State of Illinois supports a re-evaluation of the 2003 report to update
this study with economic, rainfall and engineering data.
Additionally, there are projects suggested by the 2003 East St.
Louis and Vicinity Report, including the Spring Lake Project, that may
economically and substantially reduce flood risk in the region. I,
alongside Senators Durbin and Duckworth, request that Congress directs
the USACE to complete a Reevaluation Report for the East St. Louis, and
Vicinity, Illinois Ecosystem Restoration and Flood Damage Reduction
Project, and complete a Feasibility Study of the Spring Lake Project
recommended in the East St. Louis and Vicinity Ecosystem Restoration
and Flood Damage Reduction Project report to advance this structural
project to a Pre-construction Engineering Design (PED) phase.
I also request, alongside our Illinois senators, modification to
the scope and authorization ceiling for Madison and St. Clair Counties,
Illinois--Section 219(f)(55) of the Water Resources Development Act of
1992. Scope modification is to include Stormwater Management to the
existing scope of water and wastewater infrastructure assistance, and
the requested ceiling amount would be increased from $100 million to
$200 million. This modification will enable USACE to provide
engineering design and/or construction assistance to places like
Cahokia Heights, East St. Louis, Washington Park and Granite City who
are dealing with significant stormwater management and flooding
challenges.
The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funded
seven inland waterways construction projects. However, IIJA funds will
be insufficient to complete any of these critical projects that
Congress intended the IIJA fund to completion. Unless modified in WRDA
2024, the disparity between projected costs reflect in IIJA funding
levels and subsequent real world project costs threatens to jeopardize
and delay critical ongoing and planned capital improvements that are
desperately and urgently needed to modernize our nation's antiquated
inland waterways transportation system, further delaying economic and
environmental benefits. It will also result in the IIJA failing to
achieve an accelerated return on investment, which was the intent of
Congress in authorizing 100 percent federal funding for these seven
projects, which are especially needed given the uncertainty in global
agriculture and energy markets.
To that end, consistent with IIJA congressional intent, I request
that the Committee adjust funding levels to ensure that the federal
government continues to cover 100 percent of the cost of the seven
inland waterways construction and major rehabilitation projects.
Thank you again for the opportunity to provide testimony today. I
look forward to working with you on these important issues. Please do
not hesitate to reach out to me or my staff with any questions or
concerns.

Ms. Budzinski. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Thank you very much for your testimony.
Any questions?
Seeing none, thank you again.
Mr. Davis, you are recognized for up to 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. DONALD G. DAVIS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA

Mr. Davis of North Carolina. A huge thanks goes out to our
distinguished chair from the great State of North Carolina, Mr.
Rouzer.
Mr. Rouzer. I have heard of that State.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Davis of North Carolina. And to our Ranking Member
Napolitano, thank you and all the members of this distinguished
committee for allowing me to speak on issues within the Water
Resources Development Act that matter to residents of North
Carolina's First Congressional District.
Since assuming office last January, one of the top issues
voiced by constituents has been the significant impact of
flooding throughout eastern North Carolina. This issue
underscores the need to develop effective flood risk management
and mitigation tools. Addressing these challenges is essential
in safeguarding our communities and enhancing the resilience of
eastern North Carolina against the detrimental effects of
flooding.
Flooding is a reoccurring issue in eastern North Carolina
due to frequent hurricanes, tropical storms, and heavy
rainfall. Our region consistently ranks in the top 10 for
yearly rainfall, making flood management a pressing concern.
Flooding across eastern North Carolina often ruins crop fields,
destroys homes, and tears apart roads. Families have had to
rebuild their lives time and time again.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been and remains an
invaluable ally in combating the water overflows affecting our
communities. I express my support for two projects under their
administration and oversight in North Carolina's First
Congressional District: first, the Tar-Pamlico River Basin
Project; and the second, the Princeville, North Carolina,
Project. These initiatives play a crucial role in enhancing our
resilience and strengthening our region against the challenges
posed by water-related issues.
The Tar-Pamlico River Basin Project centers around a
specific study area encompassing river reaches along the Tar
River and its major tributaries. The U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers recommends efforts to elevate or dry flood-proof 160
structures within the 4 major population centers of Greenville,
Tarboro, Rocky Mount, and Nashville. This initiative aims to
reduce the impact on structures and infrastructure while
mitigating the associated life safety risks.
The ongoing Princeville project seeks to mitigate flood
risk in Princeville, North Carolina. The U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers prioritizes minimizing damage to structures and
infrastructure and reducing the risks to life safety associated
with flooding.
Princeville faced frequent and severe flooding until it
initiated a levee project in 1967 under the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers Section 205 Continuing Authorities Program. The
project is rooted in the ``design event,'' referencing back to
the historic flood in 1919. Unfortunately, Hurricanes Floyd in
1999 and Matthew in 2016 surpassed this threshold, resulting in
catastrophic flooding for the town and the substantial loss of
residences and other structures.
Princeville is essential to the historical roots of eastern
North Carolina. It was the first town in the United States
founded by formerly enslaved people and was the first
independently governed African-American community chartered in
the United States. For these reasons, we need to protect
Princeville and its residents.
While the Water Resources Development Act of 2024 does not
require reauthorizing these projects, it is essential to
emphasize their importance in protecting communities across
eastern North Carolina.
I genuinely appreciate the opportunity to testify before
the committee today on the critical issues impacting my
constituents. I look forward to continued partnership with the
members of this committee. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair.

Seeing none, thank you again.
Mr. Costa, you are recognized for up to 5 minutes when you
are ready.

TESTIMONY OF HON. JIM COSTA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

Mr. Costa. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman Rouzer and
Ranking Member Napolitano. It is always good to be here in the
committee with an opportunity to share my thoughts on projects
that I think are important to the people of the 21st
Congressional District and the San Joaquin Valley.
Holding this hearing obviously gives Members an opportunity
to discuss their priorities for the 2024 Water Resources
Development Act. As a Member that has been around for a while,
I do appreciate the committee sticking to the traditional
bipartisan WRDA process and committing to work in a bipartisan
manner. The three of us know that that's how you really get
things done, and I appreciate that very much.
I want to talk about, obviously, as my fellow colleagues
have already spoken on behalf of their districts, the people
that I represent in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley. We
like to say that we grow food that feeds the world, and that we
have a saying that where water flows, food grows. Therefore,
water supply and reliability, the sustainability, especially in
light of climate change, is critical, a critical factor to our
region's health and economic well-being, but also to put food
on America's dinner table every night. We grow half the
Nation's fruits and vegetables, 90 percent of the processed
tomatoes, 75 percent of the world's almonds, 20 percent of the
milk produced in the Nation. The list goes on and on and on.
But projects that were developed in the 20th century, both
at the Federal level and State projects combined with local
projects, have allowed us to create this incredible cornucopia
of food that we rely on. And food, we don't think about it
oftentimes, but food is a national security issue. It really
is. And to think about this great country, the greatest country
in the world, and less than 4 percent of our Nation's
population--less than 4 percent--is directly involved in the
production of food and fiber. It is an amazing story.
So, these water projects are a key essential foundation to
ensuring that water supply. Pine Flat Dam, built in the early
1950s by the Army Corps of Engineers, is one of those examples.
This proposal before the committee is to raise Pine Flat Dam.
It currently holds, at full capacity, 1 million acre-feet of
water. By simply modifying the flood gates--not raising the
dam, but modifying the flood gates--we could increase the
capacity over 120,000 acre-feet of additional storage,
improving storage management in the face of climate extremes
like intense floods and droughts.
It seems to be in California, but other parts of the
country, where we have incredible water, rain, snow, more than
we can handle, and then extreme periods of drought. We just
came, in California and the west coast, with 3 consecutive
years of extreme drought. And we prayed and we prayed and we
prayed for rain and snow in the mountains. And we must have
prayed really good, because last year, we had record amounts of
rain and snowfall to the point where we had floods, and that
was a challenge.
But on the Colorado River that provides water for a lot of
the Western States, the Lake Mead Hoover Dam that we are all
familiar with has not been filled since 2000. So, the world has
changed. What we thought was 17 million acre-feet of yield on
the Colorado River on an average 10-year basis, we are now
determining is more like 10 to 12 million acre-feet on a 10-
year average, and that has dramatic impact for the upper basin
States and lower basin States.
So, additional benefits to increase opportunities when we
do have flood levels and above-average rainfall, it allows us
to plan to recharge our groundwater, to restore our overdraft
aquifers. Representative Napolitano has been very active in
southern California and elsewhere, where they have successfully
recharged aquifers that have been depleted, and that provides
the water for municipal supply as well as for agricultural
supply, and we are really beginning to do a much better job, I
think, in recharging our groundwater in rural areas than we
have in the past.
The feasibility study for raising Pine Flat Dam, to get
back to the point, was included in the Corps 2023 Section 7001
Report, and I look forward to continuing to advance this
important project through the WRDA process and any other
avenues that are available.
As I spoke a moment ago about how climate change is
impacted with weather patterns, with extreme droughts or
extreme floods, I want to let the committee know that your
support in recent years for the forecast-informed reservoir
operations effort, otherwise known as FIRO, has been very
helpful. Scripps Institute, a noted research and development in
the country, has done some tremendous research in forecasting
where we get these atmospheric storms to a degree to figure out
how to plan for them.
Last year in January, and then subsequently again in March,
we had an incredible amount of these atmospheric storms that
Scripps has monitored, and others. This has allowed them to use
enhanced monitoring and improved weather forecasting to more
responsibly operate reservoirs in changing conditions. And
that--what we--have to be noted, projects using FIRO and
additional flexibility have seen a notable increase in water
supply and storage benefits during times of drought. And given
these promising results, I think we should expand FIRO for more
reservoirs, including Bureau of Reclamation projects around the
country.
I mean, I will give you an example. Again in California--my
time is expired?
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman's time is over by almost 2
minutes.
Mr. Costa. OK, let me just close quickly.
There are a lot of opportunities here, and the
environmental infrastructure authorization also I want to note
to the committee for Fresno and Tulare Counties to authorize
both counties in my district to be included in new geographical
areas for eligible environmental infrastructure assistance.
With that, I thank the committee for your patience and for
extending me a couple more minutes. God bless you. Happy New
Year.
[Mr. Costa's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Jim Costa, a Representative in Congress From
the State of California
Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, thank you for holding this
hearing and giving members an opportunity to discuss their priorities
for the 2024 Water Resources Development Act.
I appreciate this Committee for sticking to the traditional
biennial WRDA process and committing to work in a bipartisan manner.
In California's San Joaquin Valley, we grow the food that feeds the
world. We have a saying, ``where water flows, food grows.'' Water
supply reliability is a critical factor in our region's health and
economic well-being.
The projects managed by the Army Corps, along with the federal
Bureau of Reclamation and the State Water Project play an essential
role.
Pine Flat Dam
One of my top priorities with an Army Corps nexus is the proposal
to raise Pine Flat Dam. Pine Flat Reservoir's current capacity is one
million acre-feet of water. Simply raising Pine Flat Dam by twelve feet
would provide over 120,000 acre-feet of additional storage, improving
storage management in the face of climate extremes like intense drought
and floods.
Additional benefits include increased flood protection, additional
groundwater recharge opportunities to restore our over-drafted
aquifers, and additional agricultural and municipal water supply for
disadvantaged communities.
A feasibility study for raising Pine Flat Dam was included in the
Corps 2023 Section 7001 report, and I look forward to continuing to
advance this important project through WRDA and other avenues.
Eastman Lake Enlargement
Similar to Pine Flat, I support efforts to enlarge Eastman Lake,
which is located in Madera County. A feasibility study modification was
also included for Eastman Lake in the 2023 Section 7001. The proposal
would increase the Lake's capacity from 150,000 to 200,000 acre-feet.
This project would provide additional flood control benefits,
reduce demand for groundwater, and help meet water demands in the
region.
Environmental Infrastructure Authorizations for Fresno and Tulare
Counties
I am seeking to authorize both countries in my district, Fresno and
Tulare, as new geographic areas eligible for Environmental
Infrastructure assistance.
Environmental Infrastructure assistance is another tool in our
water toolbox that our region should be able to access.
As an arid region that experiences wide swings in precipitation and
water availability, ranging from extreme droughts to intense storms and
flooding, the region needs eligibility to use these authorities to
upgrade and modernize our water infrastructure.
This includes efforts to develop projects such as construction of
water distribution works, stormwater management, surface water
protection, and environmental restoration, that may be necessary for a
sustainable water future in the region.
As the Committee continues to draft the 2024 Water Resources
Development Act, I look forward to working with you to advance these
priorities and achieve our shared goals of maximizing the beneficial,
efficient, and sustainable management of our nation's water resources.

Mr. Rouzer. You are a good man, Jim Costa.
Any questions for Mr. Costa?
Seeing none, thank you again.
Mr. Costa. Thank you.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Moylan.

TESTIMONY OF HON. JAMES C. MOYLAN, A DELEGATE IN CONGRESS FROM
THE TERRITORY OF GUAM

Mr. Moylan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and
members of the committee and staff for putting together this
Water Resources Development Act, WRDA.
My office has submitted several study proposals across a
wide range of issues, and I am truly very excited about the
chance to come before you today because I have been told that
the Army Corps of Engineers has never completed a WRDA project
on Guam. Never. First time.
So, while Guam already has funding authorized, there is
money there for potential future projects, there is no relevant
study that has been introduced or completed to help clarify
where this funding is best directed. So, we have the solution,
and wish to let you know our highest priority of the project is
to increase the raw water storage capabilities at what is known
as the Ugum Surface Water Treatment Plant on Guam. And this is
under the Guam Waterworks Authority, who I have been working
closely with, and my staff, to identify our number-one project.
The Ugum Surface Water Treatment Plant, in its current
state, the plant's capabilities are insufficient during times
of drought or in heavy rainfall. Whether dry season or rainy
season, it is not working. So, these shortcomings are a result
of outdated machinery and a security system that is desperately
in need of modernization.
Guam is a long way away from CONUS, and it is far, it is
about 3,000 miles away from Hawaii. We are closer to Taiwan
than we are to Hawaii. So, building a critical infrastructure
on Guam is significantly more expensive and difficult than it
is here in the lower 48, due to the tyranny of distance and
also the Buy America laws that vastly inflate the already high
cost of goods on Guam. So, this means opportunities like WRDA
projects are crucial--crucial--for improving critical
infrastructure for our island.
We know that Guam's role is a vital part of the United
States national security matrix. But what that also means is
that the People's Republic of China's sanctioned hackers are
looking for every opportunity to infiltrate our critical
infrastructure. Water infrastructure is high on the target
list. So, in addition to providing basic water needs, this
project proposes, if enacted, to increase our water security on
the island from natural disasters and malign foreign actors.
So, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity to speak
today, and I look forward to working really closely for the
delivery of the first WRDA project for Guam, the Ugum Surface
Water Treatment plant, as our top priority. I thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
[Mr. Moylan's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. James C. Moylan, a Delegate in Congress From
the Territory of Guam
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing and all the work
you, members of this committee, and your staff are putting in for this
term's Water Resources Development Act.
Guam needs help from the US Army Corps of Engineers, my office has
submitted several study proposals for a wide range of issues.
Increasing the raw water storage capabilities at the Ugum Surface Water
Treatment plant, under the Guam Waterworks Authority. In its current
state, the plant's capabilities are insufficient during times of
drought or heavy rainfall. These shortcomings are caused by many
things, but most pressing is the outdated machinery and a security
system that is in desperate need of improvements.
This is a hearing to discuss future needs, and I see Guam as a
perfect future partner for USACE. US Army Corps staff have informed me
that a WRDA project has never been conducted in my district, and while
Guam already has funding for a potential future project, no relevant
studies have been introduced or completed to help clarify where this
funding is best directed.
Being 3,000 miles from Hawaii, building critical infrastructure on
Guam is significantly more difficult and expensive than it is here in
the lower 48 due to the tyranny of distance and Buy American laws that
vastly inflate the already high cost of goods. This means that
opportunities like WRDA projects are important for improving critical
infrastructure on island.
Guam's role as a vital part of the U.S. national security matrix
means that Chinese hackers are looking for every opportunity to
infiltrate our critical infrastructure, water infrastructure is on that
target list. In addition to providing for basic water needs, these
project proposals will seek to increase our water security from natural
disasters and malign foreign actors.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Any questions for the
gentleman?
Seeing none, thank you again.
Ms. Garcia, you are recognized for up to 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. SYLVIA R. GARCIA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS

Ms. Garcia of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking
Member, for having me today again at Member Day. I know I did
this last year, and I always look forward to it.
My home city----
Mr. Rouzer [interrupting]. If you don't mind, bring that
microphone a little closer to you.
Ms. Garcia of Texas. My home city of Houston sits at the
epicenter of global trade. In 2023, it was named the top U.S.
city for international business by the Financial Times. That
reputation is due in no small part to the continued success of
Port Houston, the Nation's busiest deepwater port. Every year,
Port Houston has as many ship calls as the next three largest
U.S. ports combined, and it accounts for over $900 billion in
national economic value.
In the years since the pandemic, the port has rebounded
with explosive growth in trade, both in imports and exports.
But the port can't rest on its laurels. To keep the United
States competitive in the global supply chain, the port must
accept larger and larger vessels, and for that, they are
literally going to have to dig deep. Literally.
That is why I am here today, Mr. Chairman. I come to you to
request that the committee take up an item with clear
bipartisan support across the Houston region: for the Army
Corps to assume maintenance of Project 12.
Project 12 would widen, deepen, and dredge the port so that
it may continue to safely accept vessels as they transit along
the Buffalo Bayou. Doing so would continue a legacy of cost
sharing that has defined the port from the very start. Fun
fact, Mr. Chairman: Port Houston was the first port in the
Nation to be federally cost-shared with local buy-in, and in
the decade since, the port has grown to be a shining example of
the benefits such an arrangement can have.
Additionally, to ensure safe transit in this new age of
shipping, the port must also look beyond the bayou into the
channels of the Galveston Bay, which I hope will be the focus
of a new feasibility study to secure an additional 12 feet of
draft for larger barges.
These project priorities garner enormous benefits not only
for my district, but for the entire Nation. The port is a
keystone of American critical infrastructure, and it is quite
literally fueling America.
Additionally, we must keep pushing for support of the gulf
coast seawall barrier, which folks back home call the Ike dike.
Barriers like the Ike dike are lifesaving engineering projects.
They protect against the loss of life from a deadly storm surge
and the loss of livelihoods from a flood, something that
communities in the Houston region know all too well. Hurricane
Harvey caused nearly $125 billion in damages, and before that,
Hurricane Ike caused $38 billion in damages across several
States, including Texas.
Studies show similar barrier systems to have a near
immediate return on investment. Those are words that are hard
to come by in Government. I have seen them firsthand, from New
Orleans to the Netherlands.
We must ensure our area has the resources it needs to
protect the manufacturing, retail, farming, business, and
military supply chains in the Houston and Galveston region.
Doing so is important. It is critical not just for our local
community, but also for those important sectors in Texas and
throughout the country. I urge my colleagues to include these
priorities in the passage of the Water Resources Development
Act of 2024.
I thank this subcommittee and the full committee for their
work on these critical issues. And as usual, my office stands
ready, together with Port Houston, to answer any questions that
you may have. I know the staff will be working with us on a
number of them, but, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your time.
[Ms. Garcia of Texas' prepared statement follows:]

TESTIMONY OF HON. BILL PASCRELL, Jr., A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

Mr. Pascrell. I want to thank you, Chairman and Ranking
Member, for the opportunity to testify in support of my Water
Resources Development Act priorities. When I came to the
Congress 25 years ago, this was my first committee. It seems
like yesterday.
I submitted detailed written testimony for the record which
I will outline today.
I would like to first recognize my New Jersey delegation
colleagues, Representative Payne and Representative Menendez,
who are fierce advocates for our great State on the full
committee.
Flooding is a recurring problem in my State, with severe
consequences for communities in the Passaic River Basin. My
hometown of Paterson recently declared another state of
emergency, and residents were evacuated from heavy rainfall
causing the river to overflow the Passaic River. The river is
again in flood stage, and it is expected to crest later this
afternoon.
I am requesting the committee support a comprehensive study
by the Army Corps of Engineers to examine measures to improve
flood mitigation, river navigation, and environmental
sustainability on the Passaic River.
I can't say enough--and in 25 years that I have been in
this Congress--of an agency that has been more responsive than
the Army Corps of Engineers. And we have had good fights with
each other, but let me tell you, they have done their job, and
they have listened within the resources that we provide for
them.
Within Paterson Great Falls Park, there is the historic
water raceway system. I hope the committee will honor my
request for an Army Corps study on how they can help make the
raceway system operable. The city of Garfield, across the river
from Passaic, has several issues related to the Fleischer's
Brook, including flooding, flash flooding, and collapsed water
mains. Very dangerous situations. An Army Corps study is needed
to assess these flooding risks at Fleischer's Brook.
In the borough of Hasbrouck Heights, the Berry's Creek
tributary has been plagued by chronic flooding. I hope that the
committee will support my request for a study of Berry's Creek
to devise solutions to these issues. During the great storm of
12 years ago, it was a disaster, that whole area.
Additionally, numerous municipalities in northern New
Jersey are adversely impacted by flooding in the Lower Saddle
Brook Basin area, where there are a number of known
contaminated sites. You have all the detailed information I
provided for the committee to be a lot more specific. The Lower
Saddle River Basin area--and there is a number of known
contaminated sites. Saddle River is in its worst flood stage in
many years right now. My staff was with the Governor to witness
the destruction in Lodi yesterday, and we need to redouble our
efforts here.
The Army Corps has the capacity to provide remediation
services to address this contamination. I encourage the
committee to work with my office to explore ways the Army Corps
could perform cleanup, while the non-Federal sponsor remains
financially responsible.
Finally, I urge the committee to support the Army Corps and
the non-Federal sponsor of the Lower Saddle River Flood
Protection Project in identifying component parts of the
project that may have longstanding benefits.
I want to thank you for your time--I know it has been a
long day, it will be a longer day, I've got to run back to my
committee--and consideration of my request. I look forward to
working with the committee to ensure that the priorities of New
Jersey's Ninth Congressional District are sufficiently
addressed.
[Mr. Pascrell's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Bill Pascrell, Jr., a Representative in
Congress From the State of New Jersey
Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano, thank you for the
opportunity to testify in support of my Water Resource Development Act
priorities. I would also like to recognize my New Jersey delegation
colleagues Representatives Payne and Menendez who are fierce advocates
for our great state on the full committee.
As a former member of this subcommittee, I have been a strong
proponent of the Army Corps of Engineers. They are critical in ensuring
that America's infrastructure has the capacity to meet the challenges
of the twenty-first century and beyond.
Flooding is a recurring problem in my state with severe
consequences for communities in the Passaic River Basin. Just last
month, my hometown Paterson declared a state of emergency and residents
were evacuated from their homes after heavy rainfall caused the river
to overflow. I am requesting the Committee support a comprehensive
study by the Army Corps of Engineers to examine potential measures to
improve flood mitigation, river navigation, and environmental
sustainability. This study would explore flood mitigation strategies
through vegetation control, dredging and sediment analysis, the
potential acquisition of flood-prone properties, and an assessment of
the river's carrying capacity.
The Paterson Great Falls was the catalyst of America's Industrial
Revolution. Within Paterson Great Falls Park there is the historic
water raceway system. The raceways once diverted water from the Passaic
River into a series of channels that ran throughout the city, bringing
waterpower to the mills. I hope the Committee will honor my request for
a needed Army Corps study on how to make the raceway system operable.
This would include the impact of removing sedimentation in front of the
raceway dam and the upstream flooding conditions to the hydroelectric
plant.
The City of Garfield has several issues related to Fleischer's
Brook, including flooding, flash flooding, and collapsed water mains.
Fleischer's Brook runs through Garfield, and there are several culverts
in disrepair that are damaging stormwater and sewer lines. These
problems become more acute during rainstorms. An Army Corps study is
needed to assess these flooding risks at Fleischer's Brook.
In the Borough of Hasbrouck Heights, the Berry's Creek tributary
has been plagued by chronic flooding. Berry's Creek flows through an
area close to the city's Department of Public Works facilities, where
flooding of the creek has forced the relocation of garbage trucks and
other equipment. I hope that the Committee will support my request for
a study of Berry's Creek to devise solutions to these issues.
Additionally, numerous municipalities in Northern New Jersey are
adversely impacted by flooding that occurs in the lower Saddle River
basin area along the Saddle River and Sprout Brook, including the City
of Garfield and the Borough of Lodi. The Lower Saddle River Flood
Protection Project was authorized in 1986 to study these issues. There
are a number of Known Contaminated Sites within the Lower Saddle River
project area. Contamination within the project area must be addressed
by the non-federal sponsor, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, before any construction can take place. The Army Corps has
the capacity to provide remediation services to address the
contamination. I encourage the Committee to work with my office and
relevant stakeholders to explore ways in which the non-federal sponsor
could request that the Army Corps perform the cleanup while the non-
federal sponsor remains financially responsible. This would support the
efficiency and advancement of the project.
Finally, I encourage the committee to support the Army Corps and
the non-federal sponsor of the Lower Saddle River Flood Protection
Project in identifying separable component parts of the project that
may have stand-alone benefits. Recent flooding along the Lower Saddle
River has again demonstrated the need to advance this project and
provide flooding relief to my constituents who live in the affected
areas.
Thank you for your time and consideration of my requests. I look
forward to working with the Committee to ensure that the priorities of
New Jersey's Ninth District are sufficiently addressed.
I yield back.

Mr. Pascrell. And I yield back, Mr. Chairman. If you have
any questions, I will gladly answer them.
Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman, and the chairman will
note here that you and I have a lot of similar issues, so, I
look forward to working with you to address those.
Any questions for the gentleman?
Seeing none, thank you again.
Mr. Pascrell. Thank you.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Garbarino, you are recognized for up to 5
minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. ANDREW R. GARBARINO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK

Mr. Garbarino. Good afternoon, good morning, whatever it
is, Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano. I am here
today to respectfully request the inclusion of critical
authorization language for my district in the 2024 Water
Resources Development Act.
In September of 2023, heavy rainfall brought on by a
nor'easter washed away significant sections of the Fire Island
shoreline. The result was homes were left extremely close to
the water, boardwalks were hanging freely in the air, and
emergency vehicles were unable to drive on eroded beaches.
Coastal erosion on Fire Island has been a problem for
decades and threatens critical infrastructure as well as
private property. Just a few months ago, a power station on
Fire Island was so close to the eroded coastline that emergency
protective work had to be completed to prevent it from being
compromised and falling into the sea. In Seaview, their local
utilities are also susceptible to flooding due to beach
erosion, which is now threatening water wells.
In addition to serving as home for many of my constituents,
Fire Island fulfills an important purpose as a barrier island
which protects Long Island from erosion and storms.
The Army Corps of Engineers has determined that the weather
event that caused this damage does not meet the requirements
under Public Law 84-99 for emergency renourishment. Therefore,
instead of engaging in emergency renourishment work, the Army
Corps will continue in accordance with the Fire Island Inlet to
Montauk Point, or FIMP, project schedule. Under this project
schedule, renourishment won't take place for a few years. Until
then, we are left in limbo with respect to when emergency
Federal assistance can be provided between scheduled
renourishment periods.
Each passing storm increases the damage to our shoreline.
Just this Tuesday, the town of Babylon notified my office that
heavy rainfall had eroded their local beaches so badly that a
playground and a pavilion structure were close to being
compromised. The day after, I was notified the playground is
now unusable and in the sea, and the water has made its way to
the pavilion structure. Timely renourishment is necessary to
prevent further deterioration.
Our communities in Massapequa are similarly threatened by
erosion. In the last 2 years, the town of Oyster Bay has spent
over $3 million to purchase sand and rebuild Tobay Beach.
Without this investment, Tobay would have been compromised, as
well.
The longer we leave these problems unchecked, the greater
the probability that Long Island will require increased support
for infrastructure resiliency projects. If we can address this
problem quickly, we can avoid having to address even greater
damage in the future.
To address this issue, I will be submitting proposed
authorization language that will allow renourishment to occur
following nor'easters affecting the Fire Island National
Seashore and neighboring hamlets in between scheduled periods.
My submission is based off a similar authorization that was
included in the 2022 Water Resources Development Act for the
State of Delaware.
The current situation on Fire Island has highlighted the
need to create a mechanism for permitting supplemental work
outside the typical FIMP renourishment windows, should similar
damage occur in the future. It is my hope that this year's WRDA
can provide Long Island and Fire Island residents with the
assistance they so desperately require. Thank you for the
opportunity to highlight this incredibly important issue.
[Mr. Garbarino's prepared statement follows:]

Congress From the State of New York
Good afternoon Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano,
I am here today to respectfully request the inclusion of critical
authorization language for my district in the 2024 Water Resources
Development Act.
In September of 2023, heavy rainfall brought on by a nor'easter
washed away significant sections of the Fire Island shoreline. The

hanging freely in the air, and emergency vehicles being unable to

TESTIMONY OF HON. SUSIE LEE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM
THE STATE OF NEVADA

Ms. Lee of Nevada. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,
Ranking Member Napolitano, for holding today's hearing and for
this opportunity to highlight three top priorities for Nevada's
Third Congressional District as you continue to craft the Water
Resources Development Act of 2024.
No one knows better than a Nevadan just how precious our
Nation's water resources truly are, especially in southern
Nevada, where we get about 90 percent of our water from the
Colorado River. For the community of Laughlin specifically,
located in the rural, most southern part of my district, that
number jumps to 100 percent.
Laughlin's water treatment and delivery system is the only
such system managed by the Las Vegas Valley Water District that
both lacks a secondary water source and lags in water storage
capacity. This would already be concerning enough, if not
compounded by the fact that Laughlin, like many communities in
the Southwest, continues to have to contend with the effects of
the worst drought in at least 1,200 years.
My first request is for authorizing urgent environmental
infrastructure assistance for Laughlin's water system in the
WRDA 2024 to facilitate the construction of additional storage
tanks to ensure adequate reserves, fire flow, and system
redundancy, as well as the construction of a new groundwater
well to provide a secondary source for the Laughlin community
to be able to meet emergency water needs.
I am also asking that this year's WRDA bill include my
legislation to raise the funding cap on the Las Vegas Wash
system. The Las Vegas Wash is the primary drainage channel for
the Las Vegas Valley watershed, carrying about 200 million
gallons of water to Lake Mead every single day, a key resource
that makes it possible for southern Nevada to recycle nearly
every drop of water that goes down our drains.
The federally backed Las Vegas Wash Program has been
essential to protecting and enhancing the wash by supporting
erosion control efforts, as well as biological and other
restoration activities. Originally authorized more than two
decades ago in WRDA 2000, raising the program's funding cap in
WRDA 2024 will ensure that vital Federal assistance for the
wash can continue.
And finally, I am pleased to join Ranking Member Napolitano
in seeking to elevate water supply and water conservation to
primary mission areas in the U.S. Corps of Engineers. For too
long, these priorities, which only grow more pressing for
southern Nevada with each passing day, have been regarded as
ancillary or secondary to other responsibilities of the Corps
such as navigation and flood control.
Requiring the Corps to give water supply and conservation
equal priority moving forward will strengthen numerous
initiatives that stand to benefit Nevada, the West, and the
country as a whole, including measures to promote the use of
innovative technologies and practices such as forecast-informed
reservoir operations and managed aquifer recovery to maximize
the availability of water supply opportunities and the
development of drought contingency plans for communities served
by the Corps water supply projects.
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Napolitano,
for the opportunity to appear today on this critical
legislation.
[Ms. Lee of Nevada's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Susie Lee, a Representative in Congress From
the State of Nevada
Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano, for
holding today's hearing--and for this opportunity to highlight the
three top priorities for Nevada's 3rd Congressional District as you
continue to craft the Water Resources Development Act of 2024.
No one knows better than a Nevadan just how precious our nation's

Thank you again to the Chairman and Ranking Member for the
opportunity to appear today to speak on this critical legislation. I
yield back the balance of my time.

Ms. Lee of Nevada. And with that, I yield the balance of my
time.
Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentlelady. Are there any questions
or comments?
Mrs. Napolitano. No questions, but just a comment, Mr.
Chair.
Thank you, Mrs. Lee, for supporting that mission that we
have asked the Corps to take on, and we hope more Members come
aboard because it is something that is really necessary for the
whole country. Thank you.
Ms. Lee of Nevada. I will be carrying the torch in your
absence. Thank you.
Mr. Rouzer. We thank the gentlelady.
Ms. Schultz, you are recognized for up to 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and
Ranking Member Napolitano. I appreciate the opportunity to have
this chance to share how vital the Water Resources Development
Act is to America's communities, and especially for Floridians.
The Army Corps of Engineers has major ongoing projects
throughout south Florida, from restoring the Everglades and
investing in our ports, to fighting rising seas by nourishing
beaches and managing flood risk. Obviously, the Corps' work is
vital to Florida on many urgent fronts.
The first item I want to bring to the committee's attention
is the Western Everglades Restoration Project. Within the
boundaries of the Western Everglades is reservation land that
is home to the Miccosukee and Seminole Tribe of Florida. You
will also find Big Cypress National Preserve and a portion of
Everglades National Park there. With this watershed providing
40 percent of the water flowing into Everglades National Park
and Florida Bay, it is crucial to authorize the construction of
this project in WRDA.
To meet the Biden administration's ambitious goals for
reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, it is imperative that
we adopt a comprehensive approach. One effective lever within
reach is the optimization of fuel efficiency in the Corps'
existing vehicle fleet. And we don't need to invest billions in
new boats and vessels to achieve this.
By incorporating real-time emissions measurements and
recommending operational and technical efficiency improvements,
we can achieve substantial cost savings for American taxpayers
while also contributing to environmental conservation. I
propose that we include language in this WRDA encouraging the
Corps to consider investing in this new technology and to brief
Congress on potential opportunities to leverage this technology
in the future.
Next, I want to highlight that the Corps recently
implemented new shore protection policy guidelines. The beach
renourishment work the Corps performs along our Nation's
coastlines is invaluable to our local communities, especially
in south Florida. A wide, nourished beach system absorbs wave
energy, protects upland areas from flooding, and mitigates
erosion.
Before the Corps performs work, they need easements from
adjacent landowners. That makes sense; we don't want to strip
landowners of their property rights. But the Corps changed
their policy and now requires non-Federal sponsors to acquire
perpetual construction easements from 100 percent--100
percent--of the upland owners within a project footprint. This
is a different interpretation than was used in the past 20 to
30 years, and it has placed a number of projects in Broward
County and around the country at risk because getting these
easements can be difficult.
I ask the committee to work with the Corps on finding a
solution moving forward that works for everyone, because we
cannot let these important projects stall and fail. The Corps'
current interpretation of congressional intent is not accurate
and was not the interpretation they used for decades. We cannot
bring vital beach renourishment to a screeching halt.
The last issue I want to bring to the committee's attention
is Everglades restoration work performed by the Corps. I ask
the committee to include language authorizing the Corps to
continue to use and implement the incremental funding clause
for large CERP projects like the EAA Reservoir. Using
incremental funding demonstrably reduces project delivery
timelines and costs, saving American taxpayer dollars while
also preserving America's Everglades.
Additionally, I ask the committee to direct the Corps to
provide a report to Congress on the modifications that were
made to the design of the EAA Reservoir, including the depth
and size of the reservoir and why such modifications were
necessary.
I appreciate the work you put into this legislation, and
that you give Members an opportunity to provide input and
feedback in advance of the development of the WRDA bill, and I
look forward to helping you pass this bill yet again this year.
Thank you both so much.

Mr. James. Thank you.

TESTIMONY OF HON. MARY E. MILLER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

Mrs. Miller of Illinois. Chairman Graves and Ranking Member
Larsen, thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of
Illinois' 15th Congressional District. I am here today to speak
in support of my bill, H.R. 5722, the Upper Mississippi River
Levee Safety Act, which I strongly urge the committee to
consider in the Water Resources Development Act of 2024.
Levees along the upper Mississippi River protect countless
homes and thousands of acres of farmland from flooding. They
are essential to residents, farmers, and business owners who
live and work along the upper Mississippi. This legislation
would give local levee districts along the upper Mississippi
River more flexibility to maintain their systems and allow them
to better prepare for future flooding by addressing the Federal
regulatory challenges that make levee maintenance and
improvements difficult.
This bill directs the Army Corps of Engineers to issue more
frequent design standard updates, which will help levee
districts better respond to changing rain and flood patterns.
This complements the investments already made by Congress and
affirms congressional intent in how the Army Corps regulates
levee operators along the upper Mississippi River.
I am pleased to be joined on this bill on a bipartisan
basis by several of my colleagues in the Illinois delegation
and on this committee. This legislation has the support of
regional stakeholders, including the Upper Mississippi,
Illinois, and Missouri Rivers Association; the Illinois Farm
Bureau; and Corn Belt Ports; as well as local leaders in my
district.
Again, I thank you for your consideration and the chance to
speak here today. I urge the committee to give this measure
strong consideration as it works to draft WRDA 2024, and I look
forward to working with my colleagues to address these issues,
which are critically important to Illinois and every State in
the upper Mississippi region. Thank you.

TESTIMONY OF HON. RICK W. ALLEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA

Mr. Allen. Thank you, Chairman James and Ranking Member
Larsen, for the opportunity to provide this testimony and
highlight priorities for the Water Resources Development Act
that are critical to the 12th Congressional District of
Georgia--namely, the consistent issues we have experienced with
the Corps of Engineers regarding the New Savannah Bluff Lock
and Dam, or, in short, lock and dam.
Many of you probably recall that I have testified before
this committee in years past multiple times, which should also
underscore the importance of the lock and dam to the residents
of my district and the city of Augusta.
I want to thank Congressman Mike Collins for raising this
issue in the T&I hearing in June with the Corps of Engineers. I
would also like to thank Congressman Hank Johnson for being a
willing partner on this issue in the past, as well.
Due to environmental mitigation from the Savannah Harbor
Expansion Project, or SHEP, the Corps is responsible for
constructing a mitigation feature that would allow sturgeon and
other endangered fish to access new spawning grounds. Dating
back to the 1930s, the Savannah Lock and Dam was originally
authorized for navigation purposes. But after it was no longer
used for commercial navigation, many of the Central Savannah
River Area's largest job creators and municipalities continue
to draw from the pool that the lock and dam was designed to
maintain.
In the 2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the
Nation, or WIIN Act, the language required the fish passage
structure to maintain the pool for navigation, water supply,
and recreational activities, as in existence on the date of
enactment of this act. The Corps selected a rock weir as an
alternative to replace the lock and dam, which I strongly
opposed, as it would drop the pool level far below the needs of
the community. Lowering the pool does not meet the requirements
in the WIIN Act and is unacceptable, in addition to possible
flooding--definitely flooding--downstream.
In a disastrous simulation carried out by the Corps, we saw
firsthand the dreadful impacts of the lower water level that
would result from the installation of a rock weir. We saw
marooned boats and docks on the ground, to excess debris,
mudflats, the riverbanks caving in, and these businesses not
able to draw the water they need, and the cities not able to
draw the water they need to manufacture their products and to
provide for their citizens.
To my relief, the United States District Court of South
Carolina ruled against the Corps' proposed plan to remove the
lock and dam in favor of the rock weir. However, the appeals
court remanded the case back to the district court for further
action, placing us back in legal limbo. So, we have to do this
legislatively.
Throughout this tenuous process, Congressman Joe Wilson and
I have worked closely with local community leaders and
stakeholders who have all agreed that maintaining the water
level of the pool above the lock and dam is critical, so our
water users are not affected. The cities of Augusta and North
Augusta, as well as Richmond and Aiken Counties, have come
together supporting resolutions to protect the lock and dam and
maintain the pool at the level of 114.5 feet.
If the committee takes anything away from my testimony
today, it should be this: the Corps is not in compliance with
the WIIN Act law by choosing an alternative that does not
maintain the pool at the 114.5 foot level, as it was in
December of 2016 when the law was enacted, despite repeated
bicameral reiterations of congressional intent. I urge the
committee to work with me to include language that will repair
and maintain the lock and dam and keep the pool level that our
community desperately needs, while still accommodating a fish
passage required by SHEP.
I would also like to flag for the committee another WRDA
priority of mine. I am seeking a new feasibility study
authorization or a modification to an existing study
authorization to examine the benefit of further widening and
deepening the harbor of the Port of Savannah to better
accommodate today's commercial demands and to prepare for
meeting tomorrow's trade needs.
Thank you again to the committee for holding this Member
Day, and I look forward to continuing to work with you on this
issue.

importance of the Lock and Dam to the residents of my district.
I want to thank Congressman Mike Collins for raising this issue in
a T&I hearing in June, with the Corps of Engineers, and would also like
to thank Congressman Hank Johnson for being a willing partner on this
issue in the past, too.
Due to environmental mitigation from the Savannah Harbor Expansion
Project, or SHEP, the Corps is responsible for constructing a
mitigation feature that would allow sturgeon and other endangered fish
to access their historic spawning grounds above the Lock and Dam near
Augusta, Georgia.
Dating back to the 1930s, the dam was originally authorized for
navigation purposes, but after it was no longer used for commercial
navigation, many of the Central Savannah River Area's largest job
creators and municipalities draw from the pool that the Lock and Dam
has created.
In the 2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation, or
WIIN, Act, the language required the fish passage structure to
``maintain the pool for navigation, water supply, and recreational
activities, as in existence on the date of enactment of this Act'' for
either a ``repair of the lock wall of the New Savannah Bluff Lock and
Dam and modification of the structure'' or ``removal of the New
Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam on completion of construction of the [fish
passage] structure.''
The Corps selected a rock weir as an alternative to replace the
Lock and Dam, which I strongly opposed as it would drop the pool level
far below the needs of the community. Lowering the pool does not meet
the requirements outlined in the WIIN Act and is unacceptable.
Additionally, in a disastrous simulation carried out by the Corps,
we saw firsthand the dreadful impacts of the lower water level that
would result from the installation of a rock weir. From marooned boats
and docks to excess debris and mudflats exposed throughout the river,
the Corps was forced to abandon the simulation due to instability on
the riverbank.
To my relief, the United States District Court of South Carolina
later ruled against the Corps' proposed plan to remove the Lock and Dam
in favor of the rock weir. However, the appeals court remanded the case
back to the district court for further action, placing us back in legal

required by SHEP.

of both widening and deepening the harbor at the Port of Savannah to
better accommodate today's commercial demands and to prepare for

look forward to continuing to work with you on this issue.

TESTIMONY OF HON. DARREN SOTO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

Mr. Soto. Thank you, Chairman James and Ranking Member
Napolitano, for the opportunity to talk about our WRDA projects
this year. I bring you greetings from central Florida, the home
of the northern Everglades.
As many people may know, the Everglades starts all the way
in Orange County and flows through the Shingle Creek, through
the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes, down through Kissimmee River to
Lake Okeechobee, and then forms the national park that we all
know, love, and endear. And this is a critical area for water
quality, for agriculture, wildlife corridors, recreation, and
navigation.
The first project I would like to brief you on is the
Northern Lake Tohopekaliga Restoration and Water Quality
Improvement Project. This is part of the Kissimmee Chain of
Lakes, and it is there to improve flood storage, and reduce
nutrient and sediment flow into the upper Kissimmee Basin and
the Lake Okeechobee watershed.
And I would be remiss if I did not mention in Hurricane
Irma and in Hurricane Ian, we saw these water systems tested to
the limit and then some, with flooding affecting many
neighborhoods throughout central Florida. And as we see
hurricanes getting more intense, it's very important that we
continue to keep these water systems up to the capacity that
they need to protect so many central Florida residents.
The area is also home to the Kissimmee River, which was the
largest river restoration in the history of the world, a
bipartisan $1 billion project to restore the Kissimmee River to
make sure water is clean going into the southern Everglades
region.
The second project is the Sediment and Debris Management
Program and Feasibility Study for East Lake Tohopekaliga, Boggy
Creek, and its tributaries to improve water flows and reduce
flooding, and help with sediment and debris management also in
the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes part of this area.
The third is a request through the Central Florida Water
Initiative, which is a bipartisan initiative for water supply
in central Florida to create alternative water supply projects.
This one includes the St. Johns River/Taylor Creek Reservoir
Alternative Water Supply Project to increase local water supply
beyond what is currently available through permitted
groundwater. Right now we get most of our water through the
aquifer, but we need to establish more reservoirs. The beauty
is, this reservoir was already made eligible for water storage
in past WRDA bills, and now this would be about expanding this
reservoir to help out, particularly, agriculture and central
Florida homes.
The reservoir is the foundation for developing subsequent
phases of the project such as the treatment plant. It also
would serve central Florida residents in Brevard, Orange, and
Osceola Counties, where I and Representative Bill Posey
represent. And it is part of the regional partnership to supply
up to 54 million gallons per day in annual average daily flow
of treated surface water for public supply.
The next project is Lake Conway, which is north of East
Lake Toho and connects through Boggy Creek, and is just north
of the Orlando International Airport, one of the biggest
airports in the Nation. This would be for debris removal and
environmental restoration including water quality improvement.
We saw during Hurricane Ian that Lake Conway flooded and East
Lake Toho flooded, and we literally had to hold water in Lake
Conway for days to make sure we didn't have even worse
flooding. And so, all these systems, as you see throughout many
of these water systems in the Nation, are all interconnected.
And lastly, to expand the Regional Sediment Management
Program. We can navigate all the way to the ocean and beyond
through the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes, through the Kissimmee
River and out Lake Okeechobee. And so, making sure that we
could help both the waterways, as well as use this sand that
they pull out for navigation for beach renourishment in Florida
and other areas, we can make this work in multiple ways.
So, thank you, Chairman James. Thank you, Ranking Member
Napolitano, for your time today. I really appreciate it.
[Mr. Soto's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Darren Soto, a Representative in Congress
From the State of Florida
Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, thank you for allowing me
to testify before the Committee about my priorities for the Water
Resources Development Act of 2024.
Among the requests I am making is to expand and build upon the Army
Corp of Engineers' existing authority to create a Florida-specific
program that removes sedimentary shoals in Florida waterways and
relocates the pristine sand from the shoals to renourish sandy beaches
along the Florida coast. Additionally, I request making Osceola
County's chain of lakes, rivers, and tributaries be a priority for this
program.
In terms of projects, I request the authorization of a feasibility
study for East Lake Tohopekaliga, Boggy Creek, and their connected
tributaries for sediment and debris management. My environmental
infrastructure requests include:

The Northern Lake Tohopekaliga Restoration and Water
Quality Improvement Project, which would allow for flood storage and
reduction of nutrient and sediment flow to the Upper Kissimmee Basin of
the Lake Okeechobee Watershed.

The Historic Whitted Neighborhood Sewer Connection, which
would connect to the City of St. Cloud's sewer system and provide safe
and reliable wastewater disposal to approximately 52 residents within
the historic African American Whitted Neighborhood located in the
Narcoossee area of Osceola County, FL.

Creation of a Sediment and Debris Management program for
East Lake Tohopekaliga, Boggy Creek, and Tributaries to improve flood
conveyance. Natural sediment flows through East Lake Tohopekaliga are
restricted by controlled water flows resulting in navigational
impairments, reduction of surface area in the lake for recreation and
crucial littoral habitat, increased flood stages upstream, and
increased nuisance vegetation.

The St. Johns River/Taylor Creek Reservoir (TCR)
Alternative Water Supply Project, which aims to meet future water
supply demands beyond permitted groundwater supplies, serving Central
Florida residents in portions of Brevard County, Orange County, and
Osceola County. This reservoir/levee construction is the foundation for
developing subsequent phases of the project, including transmission
mains, pumping, and a treatment plant.

Alternative water supply projects in the Central Florida
Water Initiative area that provide regional benefits to Toho Water
Authority and its member governments and Orange County Utilities. The
project is in eastern Orange and Osceola Counties and is being
implemented as a regional partnership between Orange County, Orlando
Utilities Commission, City of Cocoa, East Central Florida Services, and
Toho Water Authority to supply up to 54 million gallons per day (MGD)
annual average daily flow of treated surface water for public supply.

Lake Conway environmental restoration, flood control, and
debris removal, including water quality improvement, to mitigate future
flooding and clear the lake of existing invasive species such as
hydrilla.

Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Larsen, I look forward to working with
you to advance my priorities in this bill and I welcome any questions
you may have. Thank you and I yield back.

Mr. James. Thank you, Representative Soto.
Do any members of our committee have any questions for our
witness?
Thank you. Hearing none, sir, you are dismissed.
Representative Bobby Scott, your time is 5 minutes, sir.

TESTIMONY OF HON. ROBERT C. ``BOBBY'' SCOTT, A REPRESENTATIVE
IN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA

Mr. Scott of Virginia. Thank you, Chairman James, Ranking
Member Napolitano, and members of the Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to
discuss the priorities of Virginia's Third Congressional
District in the upcoming Water Resources Development Act.
I represent Virginia's Third Congressional District, where
the Chesapeake Bay meets the James and Elizabeth Rivers, and
where water represents both challenges and opportunities. The
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers works to keep America's waterways
and ports open to trade while working with communities across
Hampton Roads to ensure that we can continue to live with the
water surrounding us and shaping many aspects of our lives.
In my home district is the Port of Virginia, which is one
of the largest and busiest ports on the eastern seaboard. With
95 percent of our Nation's trade moving by water, it is
essential that the port, which is the third largest container
port in the country and supports nearly 1.3 million jobs
nationally, is able to maintain operations.
The Third Congressional District is also home to multiple
shipyards and the Norfolk Naval Station, the largest naval base
in the world. These waterways are essential to our communities'
continued prosperity as well as our national security.
It is also critical to our financial well-being that we
ensure that the Port of Virginia is able to handle an increased
number and size of container vehicles. The port and the Army
Corps of Engineers have undertaken the dredging, widening, and
deepening of the Norfolk Harbor and channels to ensure safe and
efficient two-way passage for the new, larger containerships.
And I would like to take a moment to thank the members of
the committee for their work with the Port of Virginia which
allowed it to continue operations, especially at a time when
shipping delays plagued many other ports across the country.
As the committee begins its drafting of the 2024 Water
Resources Development Act, I respectfully request that the
committee include a modification of the Norfolk Harbor and
Channels Navigation Project to include the deepening of
Anchorage F. This modification is consistent with the
recommendations of the Army Corps of Engineers and will ensure
that the port's reliability and efficacy is not interrupted.
My district is also the home of the city of Norfolk, which
has been a leader in ensuring that the city can manage the
surrounding rising water and is already serving as an example
to other municipalities working to adapt to climate change.
Unfortunately, due to climate-driven sea level rise compounded
by historic land subsidence in the region, inundation from
these waterways poses a serious risk. High tides, nor'easters,
and hurricanes exacerbate the risk of flooding in the city of
Norfolk and around the region. As the home of the Norfolk Naval
Station and numerous other Federal and military facilities,
this recurrent flooding poses a national security risk.
And I would like to again thank the committee for moving
the Norfolk Coastal Storm Risk Management Project forward, as
well as the Virginia Peninsula Flood Study.
State and local officials in Virginia already appreciate
the significant threat of sea level rise. Unfortunately, the
cost of proactively and aggressively addressing this problem
head-on is far too great for the city to bear by itself, and we
need continued support from the Federal Government. To that
end, I am requesting that the committee add the city of Norfolk
to the Temporary Relocation Assistance Pilot Program due to the
ongoing Norfolk Coastal Storm Risk Management Project. This
would allow Norfolk to join other communities in extending
temporary relocation assistance to those who are impacted by
the nonstructural program of the Norfolk project. These
nonstructural adaptations are to individual buildings in
communities that are vulnerable to flood risk.
And finally, I request that the committee include language
authorizing the Army Corps of Engineers to include Federal
lands in their coastal resiliency studies. As I have mentioned
earlier, Hampton Roads is surrounded by water and home to
numerous Federal facilities and military infrastructure, and
these areas would be included in these studies. Our area, our
region is a perfect example of why comprehensively studying
flooding is essential, and how we can only resolve the coastal
resilience puzzle when we are able to consider all of the
pieces. We have to include all of them, including the Federal
agencies.
So, Chairman and Ranking Member, thank you for the
opportunity to share my priorities for the forthcoming Water
Resources Development Act of 2024, and I look forward to
working with you as we continue this critical work. Thank you.

I represent the 3rd congressional district of Virginia where the
Chesapeake Bay meets the James and Elizabeth Rivers, and where water
presents both challenges and opportunities. The U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers work to keep America's waterways and ports open to trade,
while working with communities across Hampton Roads to ensure that we
can continue to live with the water that surrounds us and shapes many
aspects of our lives.
My district is home to the Port of Virginia which is one of the
largest and busiest ports on the eastern seaboard. With 95 percent of
our nation's trade moving by water, it is essential that the port,
which is the third largest container port in the country and supports
nearly 1.3 million jobs nationally, is able to maintain operations. The
3rd district is also home to multiple shipyards and Naval Station
Norfolk, the largest naval base in the world. These waterways are
essential to our communities' continued prosperity as well as our
national security.
It is also critical to our financial well-being that we ensure that
the Port or Virginia is able to handle the increased number and size of
container vessels. The Port and the Army Corps of Engineers have
undertaken the dredging, widening and deepening of the Norfolk Harbor
and Channels to enable safe and efficient two-way passage of the new
larger container ships. I would like to take a moment to thank the
Members of the Committee for their work with the Port of Virginia which
allowed it to continue operations, especially at a time when shipping
delays plagued many other ports across the country.
As the committee begins drafting the 2024 Water Resources
Development Act, I respectfully request the committee include a
modification of the Norfolk Harbor and Channels navigation project to
include deepening Anchorage F. This modification is consistent with the
recommendations of the Army Corps of Engineers and will ensure the
Port's reliability and efficacy is not interrupted.
My district is also home to the City of Norfolk, which has been a
leader in ensuring that the city can manage the surrounding rising
water and is already serving as an example to other municipalities
working to adapt. Unfortunately, due to climate-driven sea level rise,
compounded by historic land subsidence in the region, inundation from
these waterways poses a serious risk. High tides, nor'easters, and
hurricanes exacerbate the risk of flooding in the City of Norfolk and
the region. As the home of Naval Station Norfolk and numerous other
federal and military facilities, this recurrent flooding also poses a
national security risk. I would like to again thank the Committee for
moving the Norfolk Coastal Storm Risk Management project forward as
well as the Virginia Peninsula Flood Study.
State and local elected officials in Virginia already appreciate
the significant threat sea level rise poses to Hampton Roads.
Unfortunately, the cost to proactively and aggressively address this
problem head-on is far too great for any city to bear by itself. While
Norfolk has already spent considerable sums of money to study its
recurrent flooding issues and implement resilient infrastructure where
feasible, the cost of the entire project is in the billions of dollars.
Both the Commonwealth and the Federal government have been supportive
of the need and I look forward to continued support and partnership.
To that end, I am requesting that the Committee add the City of
Norfolk to the Temporary Relocation Assistance Pilot Program, due to
the ongoing Norfolk Coastal Storm Risk Management (CSRM) project. This
would allow Norfolk to join other communities in extending temporary
relocation assistance to those that are impacted by the nonstructural
program of the Norfolk CSRM project. These nonstructural adaptations
are to individual buildings in communities that are vulnerable to flood
risk.
Finally, I request that the Committee include language authorizing
the Army Corps of Engineers to include federal lands in their coastal
resiliency studies. As I have mentioned earlier in my testimony,
Hampton Roads is an area surrounded by water and home to numerous
federal facilities and military infrastructure and these areas should
be included in these studies. Our region is a perfect example of why
comprehensively addressing flooding is essential to coastal resilience.
We can only solve the coastal resilience puzzle when we are able to
consider all the pieces. Including all implicated land in a study is
the only way to ensure the study is comprehensive, cost effective and
accurate.
Chairman and Ranking Member, thank you again for the opportunity to
share my priorities for the forthcoming Water Resources Development Act
of 2024. I look forward to working with you to ensure that these
priorities are included to allow for the critical work in Hampton Roads
to continue.

Mr. James. Thank you, sir.
Do any members of our committee have any questions for our
witness?
Thank you, brother Scott, you are dismissed.
Mr. Scott of Virginia. Thank you.
Mr. James. The Chair now recognizes Representative Sewell
for her testimony.

TESTIMONY OF HON. TERRI A. SEWELL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA

Ms. Sewell. I want to thank the distinguished members of
the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for the
opportunity to submit testimony before you today.
As you draft the Water Resources Development Act, otherwise
known as WRDA, of 2024, I would like to request an adjustment
to the non-Federal cost share for the construction of the Selma
Flood Risk Management and Bank Stabilization Project that was
authorized in the 2022 WRDA bill.
Flooding caused by various storms and hurricanes in recent
years has caused severe river erosion in the historic downtown
of Selma, Alabama. Not only is it in my district, it is also my
beloved hometown.
As a result of the storms, many buildings along the
riverbank have become structurally compromised, and some
buildings have already collapsed into the Alabama River. Army
Corps of Engineers officials from the Mobile office warned that
the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge could be threatened if the
river erosion is not addressed immediately.
As the site of the historic Bloody Sunday and the Selma to
Montgomery March of 1965, the preservation of the historic
Edmund Pettus Bridge and the Selma riverfront is not only
important to the city of Selma, but also this Nation. Every
year, a bipartisan group of Members of Congress make the
pilgrimage to Selma, Alabama, to retrace the steps of our
beloved John Lewis across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to reflect
on the role that the people of Selma played in the advancement
of our great democracy. This history must be preserved.
As authorized in the WRDA 2022 bill, the Selma Flood Risk
Management and Bank Stabilization Project will reduce the risk
of the failure of 10 historic structures along the riverbank,
protect the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and provide a response for
imminent flooding events in the future.
The problem is that the non-Federal sponsor, the city of
Selma, simply cannot afford the $9.26 million cost share that
is currently required for this construction project. The median
income in Selma is only $31,000 a year, and 30 percent of Selma
residents live in poverty. The city clearly meets the
definition of an economically disadvantaged community according
to the implementation guidelines and guidance of the WRDA 2020
bill.
Moreover, tomorrow marks the 1-year anniversary of the
severe thunderstorms and tornadoes that caused destruction
across my district, including the city of Selma. This disaster
placed an unprecedented financial burden on the city of Selma
to begin recovery and rebuilding efforts from this tornado
storm.
Simply put, if the current cost structure is not addressed,
this desperately needed Army Corps of Engineers project will be
significantly delayed, and the severe erosion along the Alabama
River will continue. More historic buildings will collapse into
the Alabama River, and the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge
structural integrity will remain under threat. Not only do the
residents of Selma deserve to be protected from flooding, but
the Nation deserves to have this historic, significant site
protected.
I thank the committee for your consideration of my request,
and I look forward to working with all of you to resolve this
issue as we face the 2024 WRDA bill.
[Ms. Sewell's prepared statement follows:]

However, as the non-federal sponsor, the City of Selma simply
cannot afford the $9.26 million cost share that is currently required

only $31,000 a year, and 30% of Selma's residents live in poverty. The
city clearly meets the definition of an Economically Disadvantaged
Community according to the implementation guidance for the Water
Resources Act of 2020.
Moreover, tomorrow marks the one-year anniversary of the severe
storms and tornadoes that caused devastation across my district,
including in the City of Selma. This disaster placed an unprecedented

Simply put, if the current cost-share is not addressed, this
desperately needed Army Corps of Engineers project will be
significantly delayed, the severe erosion along the Alabama River will
continue, more historic buildings will collapse into the river, and the
historic Edmund Pettus Bridge's structural integrity will remain under
threat.
Not only do the residents of Selma deserve to be protected from
flooding, but the nation deserves to have this historically significant
site protected. I thank the committee for your consideration of my
request, and I look forward to working with all of you to resolve this
issue in the 2024 Water Resources Development Act.

Mr. James. Thank you, Madam.
Do any members of our committee have any questions for our
witness?
Hearing none, you are dismissed, ma'am. The chairman now
recognizes Representative Katie Porter, who now has a weapon
that she can brandish. Slide over. Sweetness.
[Laughter.]
Mr. James. We will wait until you are ready. You have 5
minutes when you start talking. Thanks.

TESTIMONY OF HON. KATIE PORTER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

Ms. Porter. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member
Napolitano, for holding this hearing so that Members can share
our water infrastructure priorities for this year's Water
Resources Development Act.
The WRDA process provides a unique opportunity for Members
to deliver Federal priorities and projects that guarantee
consistent and ample clean drinking water, and even help
constituents avoid devastating flooding. That is exactly what
my requests do, and I strongly urge this committee--and I know
that they will--give them full and fair consideration.
The Westminster-East Garden Grove Flood Risk Management, or
WEGG, Project was authorized in 2020 to reduce the risk to
life, safety, and property from flooding in Orange County due
to current deficiencies of flood control channels. The WEGG
Project is anticipated to protect 1 million residents, 24,000
at-risk structures, U.S. military operations, and critical
transportation infrastructure from $5.45 billion in damage. The
project will also save Orange County residents from
collectively paying approximately $3.7 million annually in
flood insurance premiums.
However, the WEGG Project cannot access Federal funding,
and its supposed Federal cost share is not enough to help the
county prepare 74 square miles for storm readiness. That is why
I am requesting that this committee authorize the Orange County
Flood Control District and the county of Orange to enter into a
project partnership agreement so that the WEGG Project can
access available Federal funds.
I also request that this committee increase the county's
cost share ratio to 50 percent for the project's implementation
to improve the flood control and the protection of this highly
urbanized, at-risk area.
The next project is one that many southern Californians
know, the Santa Ana River Mainstem/Prado Dam Project, or SARP.
SARP is designed to provide flood protection to more than 3.35
million people in Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino
Counties. Most of the construction work is finished, but it
still needs funding to acquire additional lands for the
expansion of the Prado Reservoir, installation of protective
dikes, and raising the spillway.
If these upgrades aren't made, then the surrounding area
could see more than $40 billion in economic losses. That is why
I am requesting that this committee authorize the Army Corps of
Engineers to approve new project appraisals that cost more than
$1.5 million and to reimburse the county for amended project
agreements when new easements are acquired. These requests are
necessary for the project's completion and to safeguard
millions of residents from flooding.
Finally, I want to highlight my support for a critical
drought resilience program in southern California. The
forecast-informed reservoir operations, or F-I-R-O, FIRO,
program has supported watershed monitoring and modern weather
forecasting to capture stormwater at Prado Dam efficiently. It
is really a success story of how to balance flood risk
management, water supply, and water resiliency. And I know that
Ranking Member Napolitano has done so much to champion this
project.
It should not be surprising to hear that California still
struggles with drought. Our snowfall and rainfall this year is
already very low, and because of climate change, the Sierra
Nevada snowpack right now, today, is at its lowest level in 20
years. So, we are now at a point where we need to be looking at
solutions amid a major water crisis in the West. And programs
like FIRO are a significant step in the right direction, and
they have been proven already to be successful.
Lake Mendocino, for example, in northern California, saw an
increase to its reservoir storage by 20 percent through FIRO,
and now Prado Dam, especially with atmospheric river events,
has been able to significantly reduce flood risk for Orange
County while also creating significant levels of water
conservation.
So, I respectfully request that this committee include the
projects I have spoken for in support of today in its
reauthorization. I know that you share my desire to make sure
that every American is safe from ecological and economic
disasters, and that all of our constituents are protected from
the harmful effects of lasting drought.

Submissions for the Record

----------

Prepared Statement of Hon. Gabe Amo, a Representative in Congress From
the State of Rhode Island
Chairs Sam Graves and David Rouzer and Ranking Members Rick Larsen
and Grace Napolitano, I thank the Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of
the below priorities of Rhode Island's First Congressional District for
the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2024.
Each WRDA is important to ensuring the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(Corps) fulfills its mission. If drafted with the below priorities,
this upcoming WRDA would help strengthen water resource infrastructure
in Rhode Island and across our nation by energizing our economy,
supporting resiliency projects and initiatives, creating good-paying
jobs, protecting our environment and modernizing our water
infrastructure.
Given the increased threat that the climate crisis poses, the
mission of the Corps is more important than ever to protect our coastal
communities. There remains an increased risk of extreme weather events
such as floods, hurricanes, and storms that continue to threaten our
economy and the lives of Rhode Islanders.
According to the latest data from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States experienced direct
losses from 18 separate billion-dollar disasters total[ing] over $170
billion in 2022.\1\ This worrying trend grew in 2023 to 25 confirmed
weather/climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each
to affect the United States.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coastal communities like those in Rhode Island are facing
unprecedented risk from these threats, which is why the Corps work to
reduce flood and storm damage, restore vital aquatic ecosystems, and
improve our resilience is vital.
I look forward to working with the Committee on the WRDA of 2024.
Below are specific requests that I submitted to the Committee for
consideration.
Authorization of ``Rhode Island Coastline, Coastal Storm Risk
Management'' Project
According to the Corps: The Rhode Island CSRM study was conducted
due to frequent flooding from high tides, spring tides, and coastal
storms in the study area. The study's purpose is to identify a plan to
reduce the risk of coastal storm damage along a large portion of the
Rhode Island coastline while contributing to the resilience of
communities, important infrastructure, and the natural environment. The
study area includes significant critical infrastructure at risk of
damage from future flooding and coastal storms including police, fire,
and emergency support service facilities; schools; energy production
facilities; water and wastewater facilities; nursing homes and assisted
living facilities in addition to communities and businesses. These
areas that experience frequent flooding are considered at high risk of
coastal storm flooding with an associated threat to life safety; and
are susceptible to relative sea level change.
Reauthorization of the National Dam Safety Program
Dams play a vital role in Rhode Island's infrastructure and
contribute to the economic development of our nation. This vital
program is an essential partnership between states, federal agencies
and other stakeholders to encourage and promote the establishment and
maintenance of effective federal and state dam safety programs that
reduce risk to human life, property, and the environment from dam
related hazards. Unfortunately, formal authorization for the National
Dam Safety Program lapsed on September 30, 2023. I hope this program
will be reauthorized to ensure states like Rhode Island have the
resources and support needed to monitor dams in our communities and
reduce the risks associated with dam failure.
Technical assistance to States for identifying ownership of unsafe dams
A major barrier to identifying and repairing dams in our state and
across the nation is insufficient legal expertise to efficiently
identify owners of derelict dams. I urge the committee to consider
including language that will provide states and the Corps with
sufficient legal technical assistance to expedite title research,
especially in coastal states with high numbers of unidentified dam
owners.
Modify the formula for the High Hazard Potential Dam (HHPD)
Rehabilitation Grant Program
As you know, HHPD provides grants for technical, planning, design
and construction assistance for rehabilitation of dams that fail to
meet minimum safety standards and pose unacceptable risk to life and
property. The current grant formula favors states with a proportionally
high number of HHPDs by providing the majority of funds to these
states, regardless of necessity or requested funding amount. To better
ensure federal funds are more evenly distributed, I urge the Committee
to change the formula. A proposal worthy of consideration is: one half
equal distribution between all states that apply, and one half
distributed based on a proportion of eligible HHPDs of the given state
in relation to eligible HHPDs of all states that apply.
Increase Federal Limit and authorizations for Continuing Authorities
Programs (CAP)
The last time Congress increased the per-project federal
expenditure limit for the CAP was 2014. Construction costs have
drastically increased in the last decade. Increasing the federal limit
and authorization for the CAP to account for the per-project
adjustments would better allow the Corps to meet its mission.
Use of Innovative Materials and Associated Techniques
I applaud President Joe Biden's administration for mandating the
Corps aim to design infrastructure projects with 100-year life spans.
This long-term horizon is important to building resilient
infrastructure that can withstand the threat climate change poses to
our communities. The Corps has completed several pilot projects using
innovative materials, which can be more durable and lightweight than
traditional building materials and are less likely to corrode or
degrade. I urge the Committee to allow the Corps to improve research,
review standards, and deploy innovative materials and associated
techniques for composite material because it could reduce costs,
improve climate resiliency, and reduce carbon emissions. I hope these
materials will be produced domestically to help good paying jobs across
the United States and Rhode Island, especially because our state has a
burgeoning composites industry whose growth would be accelerated by
further federal investments.
Improved Connectivity Between Federal and State Initiatives and
Planning
Rhode Island has been a leader in developing a state-approved
coastal management plan. By improving the connection between federal
and state partners for state-approved projects, strategies, and plans,
the Corps could expedite the uptake of projects. Requiring GAO to
detail how the Corps currently operates in conjunction with state-
approved management plans would better inform how to improve this
process.

In addition to the above priorities, I would also like to echo my
support for the importance of better understanding the funding
disparity we have seen between coastal and inland projects. I look
forward to an expeditious completion of the Government Accountability
Office results on this matter.
Thank you for your time and consideration of these requests that
will benefit Rhode Islanders. Please do not hesitate to contact our
office with any questions.
I yield back.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Lisa Blunt Rochester, a Representative in
Congress From the State of Delaware
Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and members of the
Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, thank you for the
opportunity to advocate for stronger water infrastructure on behalf of
the state of Delaware, especially for my constituents in vulnerable
coastal and riverbank communities.
Congress has one of the best bipartisan track records in crafting
the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA)--in fact, Congress has
passed a bipartisan reauthorization of WRDA every two years since 2014.
As the state with the lowest mean elevation in the country, WRDA is
especially important to Delawareans, who feel the impacts of rising sea
levels with every passing day. By 2050, the Delaware Geological Survey
predicts that our sea level will rise by 1.3 feet.\1\ And by the late
century, climate change will cost Delaware well over $1 billion
annually, with cumulative costs of high tide flooding across the
century sitting at $17 billion alone.\2\ These astronomical
projections, the loss of habitation, water contamination, surges, and
severe flooding are why I address the Committee with such urgency
today.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In fact, the reality of this proved true just this week, as Winter
Storm Finn tore across the United States and Delaware's coasts and
cities. This powerful storm's high winds, heavy rain, and widespread
flooding threatened to upend the lives of so many Delawareans. I urge
the Committee to pass a strong WRDA that meets this moment head-on.
WRDA is crucial to protecting communities across the country,
especially in Delaware.
In previous WRDAs, the Delaware delegation worked to strengthen our
shorelines and make our communities less susceptible to flooding and
erosion. I'm particularly proud of what we accomplished together in
WRDA 2022 through the inclusion of major provisions of the Shoreline
Health Oversight, Restoration, Resilience, and Enhancement (SHORRE)
Act,\3\ a bill I coauthored with Chairman Graves and Senators Carper
and Cassidy to protect coastal communities from the devastating impacts
of climate change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since then, Members from both sides of the aisle have continued to
recognize the importance of increasing the coastal resiliency of the
First State to protect against the numerous environmental threats to
our livelihoods and natural heritage. We've ensured the operation of
Delaware's ports and waterways, reinforced our Bay Beaches, and
implemented environmental infrastructure authorities across the state.
And for that, I am deeply grateful.
Securing the safety, economic security, and long-term viability of
Delaware's coastal and riverbank communities means building on our
progress and fulfilling our commitment to once again passing a strong
WRDA without delay. Because the reality is that extreme storms and
flooding are increasing in frequency, and when disaster strikes, it
costs taxpayers even more.
Delaware's partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is a
strong one, but we need to do more to meet the challenges of today and
the individualized needs of our most at-risk communities.
That is why I am advocating for new authorities for the City of
Wilmington and the City of Rehoboth under the Environmental
Infrastructure Program so these hard-hit localities can pursue critical
wastewater and stormwater system improvements and infrastructure.
I am also requesting flood resilience feasibility studies for the
Town of Milton and the City of Wilmington. Although they have already
worked tirelessly to address persistent flooding, more must be done.
They require comprehensive solutions so that when it rains or storms,
livelihoods aren't on the line.
As this Committee knows, coastline degradation of Delaware's famed
beaches poses a threat to residents and tourists alike. That is why I
am requesting the addition of Broadkill Beach to the existing Delaware
Beneficial Use of Dredged Material for the Delaware River project
authorization for beachfill and restoration purposes.
Finally, I ask the Committee to authorize a watershed-wide
ecosystem restoration study for the Delaware Inland Bays. This will
create a path forward for critical salt marsh restoration, shoreline
stabilization, and stormwater management.
I want to thank the Committee for their incredible work on this
legislation and their partnership over the years. On behalf of the
First State, thank you for your consideration and I look forward to
working with you.

Prepared Statement of Hon. J. Luis Correa, a Representative in Congress
From the State of California
Thank you, Chair Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, for hosting
Members' Day for members to share their requests for the Water
Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2024.
Today, I'd like to highlight two projects that in the heart of my
district.
In the 1986 Water Resources Development Act, the Santa Ana River
Mainstem Project (SARMP) was fully authorized as a flood-risk
management project. The SARMP, which includes the Santiago Creek
(Creek) component, also received funding under the Bipartisan Budget
Act of 2018 (BBA18) so that all components could be completed as
designed and approved. The Creek work represents the last component of
the SARMP.
My request for WRDA 2024, which was developed after consultation
with the Corps, would amend the current authorizing language to better
address the flood control needs and concerns of the community located
on a specific stretch of the Creek component entirely in my District.
Since the US Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) released the
proposal for the Creek, there has been a bifurcated response: strong
support for work upstream of the I-5 Freeway (I-5) and uniform,
emphatic, and consistent opposition to the proposed work between the I-
5 and the confluence of the Creek with the Santa Ana River (the River).
Primarily, the affected community supports flood control measures
but ardently objects to the wholesale removal of trees in and along the
Creek channel section in their neighborhoods that support a wide
variety of wildlife, including Bald Eagles.
This language would address the concerns raised by my constituents
directly impacted by the proposed plan by enabling the Corps to
redesign the plan.
Specifically, the language would separate the Creek component into
two distinct sections, one upstream of I-5 and a second downstream of
I-5. This would permit and require the Corps to continue work on all
other portions of the SARMP, including the work upstream of I-5, by
leaving the rest of SARMP unaffected. Through this language, the Corps
would not initiate construction in the stretch between the I-5 and the
confluence of the River unless and until the Corps redesigns the
project to minimize the impacts to existing trees located in or
adjacent to this portion of the project. This new plan would be subject
to public and environmental review. Moreover, since the entire SARMP is
funded by BBA18, all costs associated with minimizing impacts to
existing trees shall be met using available BBA18 funds.
I thank the Committee again for this opportunity to discuss making
this important flood control project work for the conscientious Santa
Ana residents who are eager to retain the wildlife corridor along the
Creek in their neighborhood.
My second request is to support the OC River Walk project, located
in Anaheim, California. OC River Walk is a dynamic and multi-
functioning project with water resource, recreational, and economic
benefits. The project aligns with the Corps' Environmental Operating
Principles, and the project is structured to avoid detrimental impacts
to the important flood resiliency functions of the Santa Ana River and
enhance its benefits.
My request is for an expedited review of the Section 404 and 408
permit process from the Corps for the planned OC River Walk. The City
of Anaheim has initiated the Section 404 and Section 408 permitting
process with the USACE Los Angeles District (South Pacific Division).
Expedited review of the Section 404 and 408 permits and associated
studies will allow the City of Anaheim to move more quickly toward
construction and allow the region to benefit more quickly from the
anticipated project outcomes.
The project has achieved support and engagement from the critical
stakeholders, including Orange County Water District, the City of
Orange, Orange County Public Works/Flood, and Orange County Parks. OC
River Walk will ensure that the Santa Ana River continues to serve as
the County's primary flood control infrastructure and increases the
replenishment capacity of the Orange County Groundwater Aquifer, while
improving connectivity, recreation, aesthetics, and ecology of the
River and adjacent land. The City of Anaheim is eager to begin
construction as soon as possible to ensure the project is complete in
time for the 2028 Summer Olympics in the region.
Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter and I look
forward to continuing to work with you on these and other issues.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Jasmine Crockett, a Representative in
Congress From the State of Texas
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I first want to thank the
Chairman and Ranking Member for their willingness to have Members
testify on the water resource development needs impacting the entire
country, including my district.
This is the core of what it means to represent your constituents--
to hear what is happening on the ground in your community, and come to
Congress to fix those issues.
The most pressing issue facing Dallas County in my District is its
need to raise the current county-wide authorization cap.
Dallas County is home to over 2.5 million Americans and supports
the flow of over $500 billion in commerce, particularly in the trade
and transportation sector impacting the entire United States. Yet our
cap is far below where it needs to be.
When my office spoke with the Fort Worth District of the Army Corps
of Engineers, the Corps stated that the current authorization cap is
not nearly enough to complete the projects currently underway.
Specifically, to complete the dredging of White Rock Lake, the
Corps stated that we need an additional $20 million dollars. But if
that is the only increase, Dallas County will be unable to make any
other enhancements to water resources in the county.
That is why, in order to complete the current projects and have
headroom for projects in the pipeline, the Corps recommends, and as
such I urge the Committee to authorize, an additional $40 million
dollars for Dallas County, Texas.
If we do not receive an increase in authorization, we will have
begun spending money on a project we do not complete. Even if we choose
to resume the project later with subsequently increased authorization,
the cost of materials and labor will have risen.
No matter how you look at it, if Dallas County does not receive an
increase in authorization, this Congress would be responsible for an
unacceptable waste of taxpayer dollars.
There are several other worthy projects that the community
desperate needs in Dallas County that you will surely hear about from
other Members of the Dallas County delegation today.
But if we don't receive the requested new authorization level of
$80 million dollars, none of those projects will be able to move
forward.
I am not here requesting funding for a particular pet project, but
instead am working to ensure the projects important to my colleagues
across North Texas are able to move forward.
Given the current authorization level was set all the way back in
2007, I hope you all will agree with me that Dallas County is long-
overdue for an increase in authorization.
I hope this Committee will take direction from the Army Corps of
Engineers, who requested this increase in authorization. And I will
close with my hope that we are able to move a strong, bipartisan bill
forward at the end of this process. We all lose, and importantly each
and every one of our constituents lose, if we aren't able to pass this
bill.
Accordingly, I urge the Committee to increase the Dallas County,
Texas authorization to $80 million dollars, thank the Committee for its
time, and yield back.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Danny K. Davis, a Representative in Congress
From the State of Illinois
Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and Members of the
Committee, I thank you for the opportunity to discuss my requested
project priority for inclusion in the Water Resources Development Act
(WRDA) of 2024. As the Committee bipartisanly advances a bill that will
help strengthen the nation's global competitiveness, grow our economy,
and enhance the quality of life for communities throughout the country,
I respectfully request your consideration of water resource development
and management related activities of great significance to the
constituents of the 7th Congressional District of Illinois.
Specifically, I want to highlight the Section 219 water-related
environmental infrastructure and development project I submitted on
behalf of the Village of Forest Park in Cook County, Illinois. Located
in the western suburbs of Chicago and bordered by the Des Plaines River
to its west, the Village of Forest Park has long experienced stormwater
flooding and overflows of its combined sewer system. In fact, the 1992
WRDA law, authorized $10 million for the Village of Forest Park to
partner with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for wastewater
infrastructure and stormwater management projects throughout the
Village's 2.4 square miles.
Unfortunately, the Village of Forest Park continues to struggle
with stormwater-related issues, such as surcharging sewers and
residential/commercial property basement backups due to its undersized,
combined sewer system. To remedy these issues, the Village of Forest
Park seeks a modification to its existing authorization under Section
219(f)(330) of the WRDA 1992 law, as amended, for an increase of $40
million for wastewater infrastructure and stormwater management. In
particular, the Village plans for the full separation of the storm
sewer from the combination sewer so that all stormwater would outfall
into the Des Plaines River. Additionally, the Village of Forest Park,
as the non-federal project sponsor, requests authorization to work with
the USACE to enhance its potable water supply and storage management
capacity by relocating and replacing its aged water reservoir and
installing a new and modernized pumping station.
In closing, I respectfully request that the Committee include this
priority Environmental Infrastructure and Water Management Project for
the Village of Forest Park, Illinois, in the Water Resources
Development Act of 2024. This modification simply builds upon USACE's
existing authority by increasing the project's authorization funding
level to meet the municipality's current stormwater and water storage
needs. If approved, this project is anticipated to have multiple
benefits for the Village of Forest Park, including improved stormwater
management resulting from the complete separation of sewers in the
Village as well as increased potable water storage capacity.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look forward
to working with you as the WRDA reauthorization bill advances.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Lloyd Doggett, a Representative in Congress
From the State of Texas
Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen:
The Waterloo Greenway project in Austin is restoring Waller Creek,
a water way through downtown Austin, which connects Ladybird Lake with
the beautiful Waterloo Park. It has been a great addition to the
quality of life in my hometown, while also offering great potential for
economic benefits. Federal funding through Section 5138. TEXAS
(authorized in Pub. L. 110-114; Water Resources Development Act of
2007) has encouraged additional private and local governmental funding.
Our success with Waterloo Greenway has inspired interest in similar
environmental infrastructure improvements from other communities. We
hope to have additional funding for Waterloo Greenway, and want to see
other communities achieve similar benefits. Increasing the
authorization for Section 5138 from $80 million to $150 million will
enable the Army Corps to reach their goals, not only in Austin but also
for other worthy projects.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Greg Landsman, a Representative in Congress
From the State of Ohio
Thank you, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and Members of
the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for the
opportunity to provide Member testimony regarding the Water Resources
Development Act of 2024.
As the Committee undertakes its important work on the Water
Resources Development Act, I respectfully request consideration be
provided to the City of Cincinnati's request for an increase of its
authorization to $30 million for much-needed Capitol Improvement
Program projects being carried out by the Metropolitan Sewer District
of Greater Cincinnati (MSD).
MSD--located in and serving Ohio's First Congressional District as
well as the wider Southwest Ohio region--is a ratepayer-funded
wastewater utility that provides service to approximately 240,000
households and businesses in the Greater Cincinnati Area, including
portions of Hamilton County, Butler County, Clermont County, and Warren
County.
MSD operates a service area that encompasses 290+ square miles and
consists of more than 3,000 miles of public sewers, approximately 100
pump stations, nine wet weather facilities, and nine wastewater
treatment plants. MSD is subject to a federal consent decree with the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency, and the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission--which
mandates extensive improvements to the MSD system primarily focused on
reducing sewer overflows. Since 2009, MSD has invested over $1.1
billion in mandated system improvements and subsequent phases are
expected to exceed another $1 billion.
MSD's approved 2023-2027 Capital Improvement Program totals more
than $1.4 billion, which includes costs associated with consent decree
Phase 2A projects as well as anticipated Phase 2B projects. In addition
to these obligations, inflation, increasing regulatory requirements,
and aging infrastructure are drastically increasing utility cost of
service. MSD is already seeing many ratepayers with paying utility
bills in the post-pandemic economy, creating a significant concern as
to the negative impacts of rate increases to fund these obligations and
continuing operations--and an increase of the existing authorization to
$30 million will significantly benefit the households and businesses
throughout the Greater Cincinnati Area.
Thank you, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and Committee
Members for the opportunity to provide testify. I appreciate the
important work each of you is undertaking for the people we all serve.

Prepared Statement of Hon. John B. Larson, a Representative in Congress
From the State of Connecticut
Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
I write today in support of the termination of USACE Contract DA-
19-016-CIVENG-56-203, regarding the Colebrook River Reservoir,
Connecticut. This contract is between the US Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) and the Metropolitan District (MDC), the non-profit municipal
corporation which provides clean water to the Greater Hartford, CT
region.
More than fifty years ago, the USACE and the MDC entered into a
contract to construct the Colebrook Dam. While primarily constructed
for flood control, the dam also created a reservoir. In return for 10
billion gallons of emergency drinking water storage, the MDC agreed to
pay a portion of the capital cost of the dam and a portion of
maintenance and operations costs over a fifty-year period. In 2019, the
MDC completed their capital expense obligation.
Unfortunately, the reservoir has proven to be unsuitable for
emergency water storage. Through the history of the project, the water
has never been utilized. The Connecticut Department of Public Health
has found that under severe drought conditions, most, if not all, of
the 10 billion gallons would be unavailable. They additionally found
that the requirements needed to connect this water source with existing
water supply infrastructure make the water unsuitable for use even
under non-drought circumstances.
In light of this, the MDC attempted to end their work with the
USACE upon completion of their obligations in 2019, believing the
project completed. Unfortunately, the USACE considers the MDC liable in
perpetuity for operations and maintenance expenses, barring termination
by legislation. As a result, unless this committee takes action, the
MDC, and by extension, its ratepayers, are contractually bound to fund
the operations in which they receive no benefit. At a time when utility
costs have risen, removing this cost is a common sense way to benefit
thousands of households, many of them low income.
I urge the committee to recognize that the agreement between USACE
and the MDC has run its course and to end this contract.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Mike Levin, a Representative in Congress
From the State of California
Thank you, Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen, for the
opportunity to submit testimony on behalf of my constituents in
California's 49th district and share their priorities on water
infrastructure issues.
My district has more than 50 miles of California coastline and I am
honored to represent such a beautiful community. However, due to rising
sea levels caused by climate change, coastal storms and flooding, and
even development by the federal government, our beaches and coastal
bluffs are eroding away. This erosion threatens vital infrastructure
that my constituents rely on such as the LOSSAN Rail Corridor
connecting San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Luis Obispo, and disrupts
the habitats of sea birds and aquatic wildlife. In addition, coastal
erosion jeopardizes public safety and recreational benefits for my
constituents and the millions of tourists to the region.
Since coming to Congress, I have fought for sand replenishment
projects up and down the coastline in the 49th district. After years of
advocacy and collaboration, I'm particularly proud to have secured more
than $41 million in federal funding to pump over one million cubic
yards of sand onto beaches in San Clemente, Solana Beach, and
Encinitas, which will widen our beaches, reduce storm damage, and
improve recreational opportunities. I'm grateful for the Corps' work on
these projects, and I will continue to promote additional shoreline
restoration efforts, including better integrated regional planning to
ensure the resilience of our coast for generations to come.
I would like to draw the Committee's attention to one long-delayed
shoreline project in particular: the Oceanside Special Shoreline Study.
Oceanside has experienced beach erosion for decades since the
construction of Camp Pendleton Harbor in 1942. The federal government
has acknowledged that construction of the harbor jetties was a direct
contributing cause of the erosion of beaches in the area.
This erosion presents a safety hazard and has damaged
infrastructure, impacted recreational resources, and threatened
property. Only one third of Oceanside's beaches sustain any dry sand.
This means the remaining two thirds of the coast, or roughly 2.5 miles
out of Oceanside's 3.8-mile coastline, have only low tide, wet sand
beaches. Two of the beaches most impacted by erosion are also the ones
that offer free public parking or are easily accessible by public
transit; as these beaches erode, public accessibility to the ocean will
erode as well. Further, lifeguards in the area must regularly rescue
individuals who have difficulty getting back onto dry land using the
uneven rock riprap along the coast; additional beach sand is necessary
in order to provide a safe ingress into and egress out of the ocean.
The federal government has a responsibility to my constituents to
right these wrongs and mitigate the environmental harms in Oceanside
that have been decades in the making. In order to alleviate this
erosion, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2000 directed
the Corps to complete a study to mitigate the erosion and other impacts
from the construction of Camp Pendleton Harbor and to restore beach
conditions along the affected shores. However, when I came to Congress
nearly 20 years later, this study had not yet been completed, despite
the statutory deadline of 32 months that Congress set for the Corps.
In WRDA 2020, I appreciate that you included language directing the
Corps to expedite the completion of a feasibility study for Oceanside
shoreline protection, and that the Corps ultimately allocated $1.82
million in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to complete
this study. However, over three years later, I am concerned that the
Corps may once again put this study on a shelf, an outcome that would
be entirely unacceptable after the communities I represent have waited
more than two decades for its completion.
It is of the utmost importance to my constituents and me that the
Corps work in an expedited manner to complete and submit to Congress
their feasibility study in Oceanside, which must include the necessary
environmental documents and a full engineering and cost analysis of
their recommended plan. I look forward to working with the Committee
and the Army Corps to get this study done, so we can finally progress
to a project that mitigates the harms done by the federal government
and restores our beaches for the safety and enjoyment of our community.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Zoe Lofgren, a Representative in Congress
From the State of California
Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and members of the full
Committee,
Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony today and for
your work as the Committee prepares the Water Resources Development Act
(WRDA) of 2024. As you consider WRDA proposals, I strongly urge the
Committee to support the following requests on behalf of the
communities I represent.
First, I am requesting an U.S. Army Corps of Engineers feasibility
study regarding expanding the capacity of Soap Lake in San Benito
County to prevent and mitigate flooding in the region. Soap Lake
currently acts as a holding basin during the rainy season and helps
regulate water flow to the Pajaro River and surrounding tributaries.
For decades, there have been several major floods along the Pajaro
River that have destroyed homes and displaced residents. Most recently,
in March 2023, the Pajaro River levees were breached, causing hundreds
of millions of dollars in damage. The County of San Benito, which would
be the non-federal partner on the study, is interested in expanding
Soap Lake to reduce downstream flood risks along the Pajaro River
during high rain events.
I am also requesting authorization of two important Environmental
Infrastructure projects in my Congressional District. The first is for
the City of San Juan Bautista to upgrade its drinking and wastewater
system by connecting to regional water and wastewater systems. Due to
excessive groundwater salt content, the City is not able to provide
adequate drinking and wastewater treatment services to its residents.
The City has identified the project as its highest priority public
infrastructure project. Without access to adequate drinking and
wastewater systems, it is extremely challenging for the City to attract
new residents or businesses. Additionally, with a population of
approximately 2,000 people, it is extremely challenging for the City to
meet its water infrastructure needs without additional sources of
assistance. This project is a sound investment and will ensure that San
Juan Bautista residents have access to safe water resources.
The second Environmental Infrastructure project I am requesting
would replace cast iron water lines in the historic downtown of the
City of Hollister. The City experiences frequent earthquakes from the
nearby Calaveras fault line, and the City's aging water lines have
experienced multiple significant water line breaks over the years,
disrupting residents, businesses, and local traffic. Many of the old
water lines also do not provide enough flow to meet fire code standards
for fire hydrants, which the project would also address. This project
would help secure reliable water supply in the City and reduce public
safety risks in the event of an earthquake or fire.
Thank you for your consideration of these requests that are so
crucial to the safety of residents in Hollister, San Juan Bautista, and
along the Pajaro River.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Stephen F. Lynch, a Representative in
Congress From the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
Dear Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, Subcommittee Chairman
Rouzer, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Napolitano,
As the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee welcomes input
on this Member's Day on a variety of topics of the upcoming year, I
respectfully submit comment on the Water Resources Development Act. For
years, this bipartisan bill supported vital projects throughout my
district from sweeping port infrastructure to river and dam
renovations. I will be submitting my requests through the portal but
would like to highlight a few of the issues today.

1.  Ensuring payment and performance protections for water
infrastructure projects, H.R. 1740

I, along with Mr. Bost, propose to amend the Water
Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) (33 USC Ch.52) to
apply a policy solution that would ensure all water infrastructure
projects using financing authorized under WIFIA, including the Corps
Water Infrastructure Financing Program (CWIFP), have adequate
protections for workers, subcontractors, suppliers, and taxpayers.

The proposed policy solution would have the Secretary
of the Army or the EPA Administrator, as appropriate, ensure WIFIA-
financed water infrastructure projects have payment and performance
security protections by requiring surety bonds if the project is not
subject to State or local payment and performance security
requirements. If a State has requirements for security protections of
at least 50% of the construction cost, the Secretary or the
Administrator must accept the State requirements. Otherwise, the
project would be required to follow protections in the Federal Miller
Act, which has been applied to all public works contracts greater than
a given dollar threshold (currently, $100,000) for nearly a century.
This would ensure common protections are applied for the Federal
interest with respect to Federal funds and other project risks related
to design and construction.

This policy solution is currently applied to
transportation projects that use the Transportation Infrastructure
Finance Innovation Act (TIFIA) program based on legislation I led.
Congress overwhelmingly supported the adoption of the policy for TIFIA
as shown by way of a unanimous floor vote, 97-0, to include the
provision in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).
Similarly, the language was included in the House-passed transportation
bill after the policy was adopted in a bipartisan en bloc amendment
that passed by voice vote. The WIFIA policy solution mirrors the TIFIA
solution, thereby maintaining parity between the two programs.

For nearly a hundred years, the federal government has
recognized the importance of requiring performance and payment bonds to
protect its public works projects. Bonds play a vital role in ensuring
that project completion will not be threatened by financially-
distressed contractors; subcontractors and suppliers receive prompt
payment for their labor and materials; projects are delivered within
budget and on time; and, as shown by an Ernst and Young (E&Y) study,
overall project cost savings. Over 95% of all public projects require
bonding under either the Federal Miller Act or state-law equivalents
(collectively the Miller Acts). However, the applicability of the
Miller Acts' bonding requirements is not always clear on newer forms of
project procurement, specifically including public-private partnerships
(P3s). Therefore, the increasing trend of using P3s to procure and
deliver water infrastructure could lead to a substantial amount of
federally-financed projects that do not maintain the same level of
protections that have been required on public infrastructure projects
over the past century.

This loophole/gap for newer forms of project
procurement, which have the same risk as traditional projects, if not
greater, leaves workers and taxpayers exposed to unnecessary risks.
Without these protections, in the event of a contractor default, the
project may come to a screeching halt for an indefinite period, leaving
subcontractors and workers without pay and forcing states, and
importantly, taxpayers, to absorb the additional costs of rebidding,
restarting, and finishing the project.

I propose to amend WIFIA to adopt a policy solution
that would ensure all forms of project procurement for water
infrastructure using WIFIA-authorized financing, including P3s, utilize
the traditionally required protections for workers, subcontractors,
suppliers, and taxpayers, ensuring parity for all infrastructure
projects.

Finally, aside from performance and payment security,
surety bonding provides a number of additional benefits to public
infrastructure projects. Ernst and Young performed a study, ``The
Economic Value of Surety Bonds,'' that highlighted a number of these
additional benefits, which include, but are not limited to:

i.  Bonded projects are more likely to be completed on time or
ahead of schedule than unbonded projects. What's more, unbonded
projects are 10 times more likely to default than bonded projects.

ii.  Bonded projects cost less than unbonded projects. 75% of
project owners report that surety bonding reduces contractor pricing by
an average of 3.2%

iii.  If a contractor defaults on a bonded project, surety
companies intervene, lowering the cost of project completion by 85% and
reducing the time to complete by two times.

2.  Better Use of Dredge Materials

Dredge Materials (primarily sand) should be used to
better our shorelines rather than being thrown out and not being used.
Dredge materials are often disposed of which are not environmentally
friendly or eliminated in a way that is not the most effective for the
Corps.

I ask the committee to value the environmental impact
of moving dredge materials from location to location without meaning. I
am told that such excess movement is ``least cost alternative'', but it
would be better for the environment and serve a better future if it was
used for shore maintenance or other recovery efforts.

Congress must value environmental impacts that may not
show on the balance sheet. Such a policy must list environmental
impacts and then refer to them as an additional cost saving technique
rather than ignoring the future of climate.

I understand that there is rulemaking on how to broaden
how Corps considers costs, benefits, impacts, and alternatives, but how
can Congress ensure that dredge materials are included in this concept?

3.  Continuing Authorities Program Funding Limit Raised

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Continuing
Authorities Program (CAP) is a group of nine legislative authorities
under which USACE can plan, design, and implement certain types of
water resources projects without additional project specific
congressional authorization. The purpose of the CAP is to plan and
implement projects of limited size, cost, scope, and complexity.

There is a limit on spending that is currently at $10
million but should be raised to $12.5 million or at least the cap
should be adjusted with inflation.

The Corps needs flexibility to spend the money
necessary to address the issues under CAP and the current limit is
harmful to the success of the Corps.

4.  Harbor Maintenance Trust Funds

I ask for visibility on the Harbor Maintenance Trust
Fund.

There is a percentage set aside for Small Harbors but
Congress doesn't know how much is going to which Small Harbors. I am
concerned that not enough is going to the Small Harbors in New England.
Congress wants to know which harbors are the small harbors that are
benefiting from this.

This was created as a set-aside in WRDA '20 but the
limits/rules haven't been followed for any of the percent targets that
was put in law.

Congress must ensure that the rules are followed and
not seen as optional.

In addition to policy changes, I am looking for help on moving a
few projects forward.

1.  New Charles River Dam

The New Charles River Dam is located on the Charles
River, between the Charlestown and North End sections of Boston. The
Charles River Dam Project was authorized by the Flood Control Act of
August 13, 1968 (PL 90-483). Project purposes included flood control,
navigation, fish passage, and recreation. The project was completed by
USACE in May 1978 at a cost of $61.3 million. The Massachusetts
Department of Conservation & Recreation (DCR) has been operating and
maintaining the project successfully over the past 40 years. The
project provides critical flood risk management to about 2,440 acres of
urban property along the banks of the Charles River. Much of this
property is in Boston, Brookline and Cambridge.

The dam forms a tidal barrier between Boston Inner
Harbor and the Charles River. The impoundment upstream of the dam is
known as the Charles River ``Basin''. The Basin extends 8.6 miles
upstream to the Watertown Dam. Water level of the Basin is maintained
within targeted elevations through dam operation. Water levels in the
harbor vary with the tides. When the water level is lower in the harbor
than in the Basin, the two submerged flood control sluiceways are used
to drain Basin waters (gravity drainage). When the water level is
higher in the harbor than in the Basin, one or more flood control pumps
may be used to drain Basin waters.

The purpose of this study is to provide technical
assistance to the non-federal sponsor DCR in the assessment of the
adequacy of the New Charles River Dam to meet changing climate
conditions. This technical assistance is in support of the
Commonwealth's water resources management planning associated with
changing hydrologic conditions, climate change, long-term
sustainability, and resilience. The first phase, a scoping study
includes gathering background information on the Charles River Dam and
identifying and selecting tasks, methodologies and models to be used
for the adequacy assessment. The Phase 1 scoping study was completed in
summer 2021. Phase 2 includes consideration of sea level rise and
coastal storms, current and future rainfall and runoff conditions in
the watershed, and evaluation of dam/reservoir operations under these
changing conditions. Phase 2 started in September 2022.

In WRDA 2022 there was a feasibility study added and I
am supportive, and this year want to make sure the study had all the
resources it needs to be successful.

2.  Smelt Brook

The towns of Weymouth and Braintree requested District
assistance with restoring fish passage in Smelt Brook tributary to the
Weymouth-Fore River under Section 1135--Project Modifications to
Improve the Environment Program. USACE has evaluated an array of
potential solutions and plans to release a draft Detailed Project
Report to reconnect rainbow Smelt with their historic spawning habitat
in Smelt Brook in the Fall of 2022 for public comment.

In WRDA 2022 this study was included in the report and
noted that there was a lack of sufficient funds.

I am waiting for the Detailed Project Report after the
Fall of 2022 public comment period.

3.  Hayward Creek

The Town of Braintree requested District assistance
with restoring fish passage in the Hayward Creek and Eaton Pond
watershed under Section 1135--Project Modifications to Improve the
Environment Program.

A federal interest determination is underway, but I
know if that can be expedited.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication for the future of water
resources and the USACE. If you have any questions, please contact my
staff, William Seabrook.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Harold Rogers, a Representative in Congress
From the Commonwealth of Kentucky
Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, and other distinguished
Members of the subcommittee, I would like to thank you for your
consideration of my priorities for the 2024 Water Resources Development
Act (WRDA). I know your Committee works diligently to ensure that all
Americans can benefit from our nation's incredible water resources and
infrastructure--whether through the transportation of goods on our
waterways, locks, and dams, flood control projects that protect our
communities from disaster, and also incredible recreational
opportunities. Previous WRDA bills have done a great deal to help the
people of my district in southern and eastern Kentucky across each of
the aforementioned areas. Whether it is the importance of locks and
dams on the Kentucky and Ohio Rivers to the Kentucky economy, Wolf
Creek Dam on Lake Cumberland, the incredible flood control projects in
many of my towns and communities, and our Corps lakes' many
recreational uses, we benefit greatly from these resources. As you
begin the 2024 WRDA process, I would like to raise four specific
priorities that will benefit those in my district in Kentucky.
1. Modify the Service Area for the Section 202 Flood Control Program
First, I request the expansion of Section 202 of the Energy and
Water Development Act of 1981 to include the North, Middle, and South
Forks of the Kentucky River, which suffered catastrophic flooding in
the winter of 2021 and summer of 2022. The mountainous terrain in
southern and eastern Kentucky has long caused the region to suffer from
frequent floods. Since inception, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Section 202 program has made a transformative impact along the
Cumberland and Big Sandy Rivers--saving countless lives from severe
flooding--but does not cover the Kentucky River and its forks.
The devastating damage of the 2021 and 2022 floods left thousands
without homes, destroyed communities, and cost the lives of 44
Kentuckians. Over $600 million has already been spent in response to
the 2022 floods, and there is plenty more to come. We must begin to
implement measures to mitigate flood damage in this region, protecting
my constituents. Expanding Section 202 to cover the Kentucky River and
its forks would enable the Army Corps of Engineers to immediately begin
construction on flood control measures, both structural and non-
structural, upon completion of the necessary studies. It is clear the
region is in need of assistance from the Army Corps of Engineers to
help prevent future flooding of this magnitude, and we fear we cannot
wait until it's too late.
2.  Authorization of Construction for a Flood Warning Emergency
Evacuation Plan (FWEEP) in the Kentucky River Basin
In response to the severe flooding of 2021 and 2022, I have secured
community project funding for several studies across the region. In
meeting with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Louisville District, it
became clear to me that a more comprehensive Flood Warning Emergency
Evacuation Plan (FWEEP) is also needed. A FWEEP across the region would
ensure that these disadvantaged communities have a fighting chance of
getting to safety should severe flash flooding occur like it did in the
past. It is a cost effective, lifesaving tool that we should waste no
time in implementing.
3. Wolf Creek Dam Water Reallocation Study Prohibition
Third, I request that language be included in this year's WRDA to
prohibit a water reallocation study to be conducted at Wolf Creek Dam.
This request would maintain historic WRDA and Energy and Water
Appropriations language prohibiting a water reallocation study at Wolf
Creek Dam on Lake Cumberland. The region surrounding the dam is one of
the poorest in the nation, and a reallocation study might lead to
increased rates, which would place financial hardship on my
constituents.
4. Inclusion of the MARINA Act
Finally, I am seeking the inclusion of the MARINA Act, which would
modernize the relationship between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and
marina owners. This legislation, introduced in both the 117th and 118th
Congress, would encourage economic growth and improve access to outdoor
recreation. This language would allow for marina owners to successfully
implement necessary facility improvement projects without burdensome
administrative fees from the Army Corps of Engineers.
The MARINA Act would: (1) cap gross revenue fees on the sales of
food, beverages, fuel, boats, motors, and boat lifts at one percent for
calculating rental payments, (2) standardize the schedule for
administrative fees, and (3) extend initial lease terms to 50 years and
renewals to 25 years. The added stability in the length of lease
contracts and renewals would also provide aid in expanding access to
credit for marina owners.

Thank you again for your consideration of my 2024 WRDA requests. I
look forward to working with you as this process unfolds, so we can
continue to maximize both Kentucky and our nation's water resources. If
you or your staff have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact
me or my staff.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Robert J. Wittman, a Representative in
Congress From the Commonwealth of Virginia
Introduction:
Chairwoman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen,
Thank you for allowing me to testify before you today. I am honored
to highlight some of the needs facing Virginia as you consider
oversight on the implementation of the Water Resources Development Act
of 2022.
The Water Resources Development Act is necessary legislation that
provides for improvements to the Nation's ports, inland waterways,
flood protection, ecosystem restoration, and other water resources
infrastructure and policy. Water infrastructure is vital to moving
goods throughout the country, from products we all use in our everyday
lives, to crops and goods we produce domestically and send abroad. I
hope this committee and the House upholds its duty to authorize
nationally important water infrastructure improvements that are more
locally driven.
Furthermore, I would like to thank the Army Corps of Engineers as
they work hard to manage more than 1,500 water resource projects with
many of them in Virginia. The Army Corps of Engineers is critical to
our commonwealth, from the Norfolk Harbor Channel Widening and
Deepening Project to the public waterways restorations projects across
Virginia.
Port of Virginia:
As a proud representative of the Commonwealth of Virginia, home of
the Port of Virginia--one of the largest and busiest ports on the
eastern seaboard--advancing the work being done by the Port of Virginia
to improve and expand its operations is critical. The Port manages
cargo that is shipped to all 48 contiguous states.
The Port of Virginia is a national gateway for commerce, supporting
businesses across the country. Moreover, in Virginia's 1st District 234
businesses utilize the services of the Port of Virginia.
As a catalyst for commerce, the Port is attracting growth,
fostering development, and creating jobs. On the state level, cargo
moving through the Port supports more than 436,667 jobs statewide and
generates in excess of $100.1 billion in annual economic impact for
Virginia.
WRDA Proposals Submitted:
I would like to take this time to highlight some WRDA priorities
the subcommittee should look at while conducting oversight of its
implementation.
1. Norfolk Harbor and Channels: Anchorage F Expansion
Anchorage F is currently designed as a 3,000-foot diameter circle
for free-swinging bow anchoring. The anchorage in its current design is
used primarily as an emergency anchorage in inclement wave weather in
the harbor or in situations of unexpected delays. For vessels to
effectively utilize the anchorage, it is imperative--and common-sense--
for the anchorage and approach depths to match that of the Federal
Channel.
A deeper and wider anchorage will allow further use of the
anchorage beyond the primary function and permit use by larger vessels
calling on our port. Additionally, an improved anchorage and anchorage
approach could provide passing vessels safe harbor during storm
conditions.
The modification includes widening the Anchorage F beyond its
currently authorized diameter of 3,620-feet to a diameter of 3,840-feet
and deepening the anchorage to 55-feet consistent with the 1986
authorization and the project depth of the Federal Channel.
2. Virginia Coastal Resilience Feasibility Study
I request oversight to ensure the USACE includes Federal properties
in their feasibility studies for the Norfolk-Hampton Roads, Virginia.
By allowing the USACE to include Federal properties for an upcoming
Costal Storm Risk Management (CSRM) study of the Peninsula and greater
Hampton Roads area, it would solve the restriction problem in
incorporating these installations and facilities into the Civil Works
planning and construction processes. I believe this is a commonsense
issue that will ultimately produce a better report of action by a range
of actors in the region.
Conclusion:
I want to thank the Chairwoman, Ranking Member, and the Members of
the Committee for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to
working with the Committee and the Corps to ensure WRDA 2024 is
implemented as intended.
