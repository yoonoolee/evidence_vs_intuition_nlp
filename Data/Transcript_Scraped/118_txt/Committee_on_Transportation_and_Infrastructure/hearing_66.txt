SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines,
and Hazardous Materials
FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and
Hazardous Materials
RE:      LSubcommittee Hearing on ``An Examination of the
California Air Resources Board's (CARB) In-Use Locomotive
Regulation''
_______________________________________________________________________

I. PURPOSE

The Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous
Materials of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
will meet on Tuesday, July 9, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. ET in 2167
Rayburn House Office Building to receive testimony at a hearing
entitled, ``An Examination of the California Air Resources
Board's (CARB) In-Use Locomotive Regulation.'' The hearing will
examine CARB's In-Use Locomotive Regulation. At the hearing,
Members will receive testimony from Mr. Dillon Olvera,
President of Modesto and Empire Traction Company testifying on
behalf of the American Short Line and Regional Railroad
Association; Mr. Roger Nober, Director of the George Washington
Regulatory Studies Center and Professor of Practice at the
Trachtenberg School of Public Policy & Public Administration,
George Washington University; Mr. Ural Yal, Senior Vice
President, Flatiron Construction, testifying on behalf of the
Associated General Contractors of California; and Ms. Heather
Arias, Chief, Transportation and Toxics Division of CARB.

II. BACKGROUND

CARB issued a regulation to reduce in-state locomotive
emissions in April 2023.\1\ The Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C.
Sec.  7401, et seq., regulates air emissions from stationary
and mobile sources.\2\ The CAA authorizes the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to establish National Ambient Air
Quality Standards (NAAQS)--which are limits in atmospheric
concentrations of ``criteria pollutants''--to protect public
health and welfare and to regulate the emissions of hazardous
air pollutants.\3\ These are National standards applicable to
all states and preempt state or local air regulations.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

available at https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/reducing-rail-
emissions-california#: :text=On%20April%2027
%2C%202023%2C%20CARB,on%20the%20Locomotive%20factsheet%20website.

act#: :text=(1970),from%20stationary%20and%20mobile
%20sources (noting for the purposes of this hearing, the memorandum
will focus on mobile sources, particularly the regulation of mobile
sources from new motor vehicles and locomotives).
\3\ Id. (Noting that while carbon dioxide emissions are classified
as pollutants, they are not classified as criteria pollutants requiring
NAAQS standards. However, two other criteria pollutants included in the
CARB In-Use Locomotive Regulation--Nitrogen Oxides and Diesel
Particulate Matter--have NAAQS limits).
\4\ See generally 42 U.S.C.Sec.  7543(a) (noting for purposes of
this hearing, the memorandum will focus on the regulation of mobile
sources of regulated emissions. The general prohibition on states or
political subdivisions enforcing individual emissions standards is
codified at 42 U.S.C.Sec.  7543(a)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because California air quality standards preceded National
standards in the CAA, CAA Section 209 expressly allows
California to seek a waiver of Federal preemption for new non-
road engines and vehicles provided its standards, in the
aggregate, are at least as protective of public health and
welfare as Federal standards, except for new locomotive engines
in CAA Section 209(e)(1).\5\ In addition, CAA Section 177
allows other states to adopt these standards without specific
approval by EPA, provided such standards are identical to the
approved state waiver.\6\

\5\ 42 U.S.C. Sec.  7543(e)(2).
\6\ Codified at 42 U.S.C. Sec.  7543(e)(2)(B).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In seeking a waiver to enforce its own standards for non-
road engines and vehicles, California must seek authorization
from EPA.\7\ EPA must then publish a notice for public hearing
and comment in the Federal Register. Accordingly, California
filed its formal request for authorization on November 7, 2023,
and EPA hosted a virtual public meeting on the CARB regulation
on March 20, 2024.\8\ EPA also provided a broader public
comment period as announced in the Federal Register on February
27, 2024, that closed on April 22, 2024.\9\

Under CAA Section 209(e)(2), EPA shall grant an
authorization unless the EPA Administrator finds:
1) Lthe CARB rule is arbitrary and capricious;
2) Lthat California does not need such standards to meet
compelling or extraordinary conditions; or
3) Lthe proposed CARB standards and accompanying
performance procedures are inconsistent with Section 209.

III. THE CARB IN-USE LOCOMOTIVE REGULATION

The CARB locomotive regulation (``CARB Rule'' or
``Regulation'') seeks to reduce emissions from locomotives of
three regulated pollutants: diesel particulate matter, oxides
of nitrogen, and carbon dioxide.\10\ The CARB Rule is primarily
comprised of four parts: 1) the In-Use Operational Requirement,
2) the Idling Requirement, 3) the Spending Account, and 4)
Registration, Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements.\11\ It
also includes an Alternative Compliance Plan and Alternative
Fleet Milestone Option that operators may voluntarily adopt as
well as other compliance flexibilities such as potential
extensions allowed for the unavailability of technologies.\12\
The CARB Rule was finalized on April 27, 2023.

IN-USE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENT

Starting in 2030, only locomotives with an original build
date less than 23 years old can operate in California, unless
they meet Tier 4 standards,\13\ operate in a zero emissions
(ZE) configuration, or if the primary engine has not exceeded
the specified megawatt hour (MWh).\14\ In addition, future
switch, industrial, and passenger locomotives with original
build dates of 2030 or later will need to operate in ZE
configuration in California.\15\ Starting in 2035, line-haul
locomotives engines build dates of 2035 or newer will need to
operate in ZE configuration in California.\16\

describing Tier 4 standards and locomotives); see also, CARB Locomotive
Factsheets, available at https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/

Furthermore, the Regulation requires CARB staff to
evaluate, in 2027 and 2032, the status of ZE technologies,
configurations, and supporting infrastructure for
locomotives.\17\ If these evaluations show the 2030 or 2035 ZE
dates to be unfeasible, the staff may propose regulatory
amendments.\18\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IDLING REQUIREMENT

For locomotives equipped with Automatic Engine Start/Stop
(AESS) devices, CARB's idling requirements would require
operators to shut down stationary locomotives after 30
minutes.\19\ For the same reasons as allowed under Federal
idling regulations, locomotives may only exceed this limit to
prevent damage to the engine, maintain air pressure for brakes
or auto start systems, recharge a locomotive battery, or
perform necessary maintenance.\20\ The Regulation also requires
that operators of AESS maintain these devices, and requires
operators to manually shut down a locomotive if the system is
not operating properly.\21\ Operators with AESS equipped
locomotives are further required to report idling events that
exceed 30 minutes as part of the regulations record keeping and
reporting requirements.\22\

REGISTRATION, REPORTING AND RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS

The Regulation requires registration, reporting and
recordkeeping on locomotive operators for all locomotive
activity in California.\23\ Locomotive operators are required
to register all locomotives operating within California by July
1, 2026.\24\ Required registration information includes
operator contact information, locomotive identifying
information, and emissions information such as road number,
engine tier, and build year.\25\ Annual reporting requirements
include all information necessary to establish compliance, as
well as data on the quantity of locomotive emissions occurring
in California, by operator.\26\ In addition to idling
reporting, these requirements are necessary to verify an
operator's mandatory contributions to a mandatory spending
account.\27\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPENDING ACCOUNT

The CARB Rule requires railroads operating in California to
deposit funds into a spending account to purchase, lease, or
rent zero emissions locomotives and associated equipment and
infrastructure.\28\ The amount deposited in the account is
calculated by estimating the locomotive's emissions in
California and the health costs of those emissions.\29\ The
Regulation permits operators to offset spending account
obligations through qualifying purchases using funds other than
spending account funds.\30\

locomotives through the end of 2029.\31\ The funds may also be
used to purchase, lease, or rent ZE locomotives, rail equipment
or the remanufacture of locomotives to ZE powered.\32\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE PLAN AND THE ALTERNATIVE FLEET MILESTONE
OPTION

The Alternative Compliance Plan (ACP) is a voluntary
compliance pathway allowing regulated locomotive operators to
comply with the spending account and/or In-Use Operational
requirements using projects and activities that achieve
equivalent levels of emissions reductions within three miles of
locomotive activities.\33\ Examples of such activities include
the electrification of trucks and operating equipment in or
around rail facilities that reduces emissions of Diesel
Particulate Matter (DPM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).\34\
Operators may use this alternative as their pathway to
compliance, or as a hybrid approach that combines partial
direct compliance with reductions achieved through the ACP but
must still comply with the idling record keeping and reporting
requirements.\35\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\33\ CARB Authorization, supra note 10, at 6.
\34\ Id.
\35\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Alternative Fleet Milestone Option (AFMO) is primarily
intended to provide a similar alternative compliance option for
operators that wish to operate zero emissions locomotive
technologies under a simplified milestone plan.\36\ Under the
AFMO, an operator must demonstrate that 50 percent of its
operations are accomplished by Tier 4 or cleaner locomotives by
2030 and 100 percent by 2035; in 2042, 50 percent of operations
need to operate in ZE configurations, and 100 percent ZE by
2047.\37\

IV. THE CARB RULE AND TRANSPORTATION BY LOCOMOTIVES

Stakeholders representing a variety of industries, local
governments and labor have commented on the CARB Rule's
economic impact on interstate freight rail transportation and
investment.\38\ According to CARB's analysis, the rule would
create $86 billion in Nationwide compliance costs.\39\ The
analysis also estimated that the costs of the rule on smaller
Class II and Class III operators could exceed annual operating
profits.\40\ In its risk analysis, CARB states that if these
operators cannot pass on compliance costs to customers, or
cannot receive regulatory relief, ``it is possible some of
these businesses would be eliminated.'' \41\ These economic
concerns for Class II and Class III operators were likewise
expressed by the United States Small Business Administration
Office of Advocacy.\42\

LOCOMOTIVE REGULATION

----------

TUESDAY, JULY 9, 2024

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous
Materials,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 2:12 p.m., in
room 2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Troy E. Nehls
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Nehls. The Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and
Hazardous Materials will come to order. I ask unanimous consent
that the chairman be authorized to declare a recess at any time
during today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the Members not on the
subcommittee be permitted to sit with the subcommittee at
today's hearing and ask questions.
Without objection, so ordered.
And as a reminder, if Members wish to insert a document

I now recognize myself for the purposes of an opening
statement for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TROY E. NEHLS OF TEXAS, CHAIRMAN,
SUBCOMMITTEE ON RAILROADS, PIPELINES, AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Mr. Nehls. At almost 145,000 route-miles, the United States
has one of the most efficient and comprehensive freight rail
systems in the world. It is also one of the safest.
The benefits of this system aren't just measured in miles
and tons of freight shipped, they can also be measured in other
benefits, including reduced fuel consumption and associated
emissions reductions. Rail is capable of transporting a ton of
freight for more than 450 miles on only 1 gallon, that's right,
just 1 gallon of diesel fuel.
Unfortunately, the Biden administration and the State of
California remain intent on pushing an unwanted, radical Green
New Deal agenda on the American people, regardless--
regardless--of the cost and consequences to our economic and
national security.
While this hearing has been called to discuss the
California Air Resources Board's request for authorization for
a State-based regulation, we should be very mindful that this
proposed regulation is not just confined to California. It's
national in both impact and intent.
According to CARB's own analysis, the rule would require
both BNSF and Union Pacific to replace their entire fleet of
locomotives nationwide to comply with the regulation, which
will cost billions, with a B, billions of dollars, and will
make freight transportation and the cost of goods drastically
more expensive.
We are also concerned about the rule's impact on the short
line operations, which Mr. Olvera will highlight for us in his
testimony. As the United States rail transportation system is
intrinsically linked and vital to the safe and efficient
movement of freight and passengers in interstate commerce,
other rail operators would also be forced, they would also be
forced to adjust their own operations.
The importance of rail transportation is so great that
Congress has enacted a number of statutes specifically designed
to ensure the preservation of this most important mode of
transportation. For example, railroads are the first American
industry to be regulated under the Interstate Commerce Act of
1887.
Many of my colleagues who served in the last Congress are
familiar with the Railroad Labor Act of 1927, which was
designed to avoid the potential for economically crippling
disruptions in interstate commerce caused by labor disputes.
Additionally, the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 was enacted to
restore the economic health of the industry at a time when the
railroads were at the verge of bankruptcy--bankruptcy--due to
the stifling Government regulation: the very same type of
economic burden CARB and the Biden administration is seeking to
reimpose.
Further, the Interstate Commerce Committee Termination Act
created the Surface Transportation Board and explicitly, quote,
``preempts all State laws that may reasonably be said to have
the effect of managing or governing rail transportation.'' That
is the end quote.
Finally, there is the Clean Air Act itself, which clearly
establishes the Federal Government acting as the sole regulator
of emissions for new locomotives. Unfortunately, this CARB
request for authorization is an attempt to circumvent the
statutory and legal requirements of both the Clean Air Act and
the Administrative Procedure Act.
Concerningly, falsely considering a matter of this scope as
a waiver instead of an agency rule also denies it coverage
under the Small Business Regulatory Efficiency Act and the
Congressional Review Act.
Moreover, CARB's proposal would fail any meaningful cost-
benefit analysis. It also fails to fully consider costs
associated with the acquisition of still nonexistent--and I am
going to repeat this point--nonexistent zero-emissions
locomotives.
The cost of building out, much less permitting the
necessary infrastructure, including energy infrastructure, is
likewise enormous.
It is for these reasons that a broad coalition of
railroads, shippers, and union organizations have come out in
strong opposition to this rule. This regulation must be
rejected by EPA and accompanied by a return to sanity in both
Sacramento and right here in Washington, DC.
I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses about the
challenges and opportunities for commuter rail service as well
as best practices to improve service, realize efficiencies, and
increase fare revenues.
[Mr. Nehls' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Troy E. Nehls, a Representative in Congress
from the State of Texas, and Chairman, Subcommittee on Railroads,
Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials
At almost 145,000 route miles, the United States has one of the
most efficient and comprehensive freight rail systems in the world. It
is also one of the safest. The benefits of this system aren't just
measured in miles and tons of freight shipped, they can also be
measured in other benefits including reduced fuel consumption and
associated emissions reductions. Rail is capable of transporting a ton
of freight for more than 450 miles on only one gallon of diesel fuel.
Unfortunately, the Biden Administration and the State of California
remain intent on pushing an unwanted, radical Green New Deal agenda on
the American people, regardless of the cost and consequences to our
economic and national security.
While this hearing has been called to discuss the California Air
Resource Board's request for authorization for a state-based
regulation, we should be very mindful that this proposed regulation is
not just confined to California. It's national in both impact and
intent.
According to CARB's own analysis, the rule would require both BNSF
and Union Pacific to replace their entire fleet of locomotives
nationwide to comply with the regulation, which will cost billions of
dollars and will make freight transportation and the costs of goods
drastically more expensive.
We are also concerned about the rule's impact on short line
operations, which Mr. Olvera will highlight for us in his testimony. As
the United States rail transportation system is intrinsically linked
and vital to the safe and efficient movement of freight and passengers
in interstate commerce, other rail operators would also be forced to
adjust their own operations.

Mr. Nehls. I now will recognize the chairman of the full

full committee for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair. You are getting
ahead of yourself. I want to thank Chair Nehls and the
committee for holding this hearing on railroad locomotive
emissions, and I want to commend the chair on setting a date as
well for a rail safety hearing.
Now that the NTSB has released its report after the Norfolk
Southern derailment in East Palestine, Congress has to act on
the NTSB's recommendations to enhance rail safety.
Today's hearing addresses how Congress can continue to
support freight movement, grow our economy, and reduce
emissions from the transportation network.
In Washington State, freight is key to long-term economic
growth. Nearly one in two jobs statewide is freight dependent,
with almost 40 percent of the State's wages generated by
freight-dependent industries.
According to Washington State Department of Transportation,
Washington State's multimodal freight system handles almost 600
million tons of cargo each year, which is valued at $677
billion.
In 2022, 15 percent of freight tonnage was moved by rail in
my State, including through rail yards in Everett and
Bellingham in my district.
So, while transportation, including freight rail, keeps the
economy and supply chains moving, the sector continues to be
the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions.
Transportation emissions are trending in the wrong
direction. For example, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions increased
1.6 percent from 2022 to 2023.
According to my own State's Department of Ecology, diesel
exhaust is one of the most harmful air pollutants. Diesel
exhaust puts healthy people, including more than 4 million
people who live and work near diesel emissions sources in my
State, at risk for respiratory diseases and complicates health
conditions for people with asthma, heart, and lung disease.
And some of this was running through my mind on Saturday
when a diesel locomotive was parked just below my place in
Everett, Washington, and spit out diesel emissions for 7
straight hours.
Thankfully, Washington State is a leader in reducing
emissions in transportation. In 2020, Washington enacted its
motor vehicle emissions standards law, which is helping
increase the number of zero-emission vehicles on State roads.
Washington's ferry system, the largest in the country, yet
also the largest source of transportation emissions statewide,
is transitioning to a cleaner and greener passenger ferry
fleet.
Washington's Maritime Blue initiative invests in a
thriving, world-class, and sustainable maritime industry for
the next 30 years. For example, my State's work on maritime
batteries resulted in a brandnew Corvus Energy facility at the
Port of Bellingham, which opened last year. Corvus' expansion
in northwest Washington State illustrates a growing regional
and global demand for hybrid power and zero-emission energy
solutions to transportation needs.
Washington State expects to meet its emissions goals for
2030, but more needs to be done to reach our 2040 and 2050
goals for a cleaner and greener future.
Congress and the administration want to be partners in
this.
Thanks to the BIL, communities in my district and in
districts across the country are investing in a cleaner and
greener future.
Last month, the USDOT awarded the Port of Bellingham a
nearly $18 million RAISE grant to modernize a shipping terminal
site, returning the site to a fully functioning multimodal
terminal with more efficient loading and unloading of railcars
on the terminal, an investment that will reduce emissions while
keeping supply chains and the maritime economy moving in
northwest Washington and on the west coast.
Congress has also invested more than $5 billion in
Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements, or
CRISI, grants in the BIL. These grants can be used to purchase
updated rail locomotives, and short line railroads can directly
apply for grants rather than going through public agencies or
entities.
The BIL also specifically allows recipients to use CRISI to
rehabilitate, remanufacture, procure, or overhaul locomotives,
provided that such activities result in a significant reduction
in emissions.
The Federal Railroad Administration is currently reviewing
applications for $2.4 billion in CRISI funds, an investment
that can fund quite a few new locomotives in communities across
the country.
So, I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses about
how they are working to build a cleaner and greener freight
rail network, and with that, I yield back the balance of my
time.
[Mr. Larsen of Washington's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen, a Representative in Congress

Transportation and Infrastructure

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON OF FLORIDA,
RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON RAILROADS, PIPELINES, AND
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
and thank you to our witnesses today.
For many, railroad tracks in this country have too often
existed as a symbol of division, inequity, and a legacy of
racial oppression. In the aftermath of slavery, and as a result
of redlining, Black communities and other underserved
communities formed settlements near rail lines. Even though
these areas were polluted with hazardous locomotive emissions,
which we now know are associated with disease and premature
death, they settled there because they had nowhere else to go.
This is why, when I would ask some of my constituents,
where do you live, where do you work, and where do you go to
school, they often respond with, ``across the tracks,'' which
serves not just as an answer, but a statement of the persisting
injustice and disproportionate burdens placed on so many
communities of color.
The California Air Resources Board, or CARB, is working to
limit harmful emissions from locomotives, including by
requiring cleaner engines after 2030 and reducing the time
locomotives spend idling. CARB estimates that these efforts
would save $32 billion in health costs and prevent over 3,200
premature deaths in California.
This regulation seeks to steer the railroad industry
towards doing its part to prevent the worst impacts of the
climate crisis. Every year, extreme weather events strike with
increasing frequency and severity as sea levels continue to
rise. For the residents of my district who live in south
Florida, these threats are not just concerning, they are
existential. We have seen constant flooding in south Florida
recently, and seas are projected to rise in Miami-Dade County
by over a foot within the next 30 years, dramatically
increasing flood risks further inland and threatening the homes
and livelihoods of frontline communities.
Just last week, we had our first category 5 hurricane in
the Caribbean, the earliest ever in hurricane season. It is now
more important than ever that we protect California's right to
implement Nation-leading regulations.
The industry's response to this regulation should not be to
sue CARB. We have had national Tier 4 locomotive standards in
place since 2015, which the industry seems to have avoided
implementing for over 90 percent of its locomotives. The
technology exists--what is missing is the investment, the will,
and the commitment to ending the legacy of railroad communities
suffocating under the deadly effects of air pollution. It is
only this commitment that may begin to make the phrase ``across
the tracks'' a phrase of the past.
In today's hearing, I look forward to learning what the
railroad industry is doing to improve our air quality and the
health of communities living near rail yards.
Mr. Chair, the United States Climate Alliance recently
submitted a letter to EPA Administrator Regan, supporting the
deployment of zero-emission technologies across all
transportation modes, and Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask for
unanimous consent to add this letter to the record.
Mr. Nehls. Without objection.
[The information in on pages 77-78.]
Ms. Wilson of Florida. And I yield back.
[Ms. Wilson of Florida's prepared statement follows:]

Mr. Duarte. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this
important hearing today, and thank you for inviting Mr. Dillon
Olvera, one of my constituents, to testify on behalf of the
American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association.
Mr. Olvera is the president and chief executive officer of
Modesto and Empire Traction Company, also known as MET, a short
line railroad operator situated in a bustling 2,000-acre
industrial park known as the Beard Industrial District in
Modesto, California.
That includes globally recognized companies such as E&J
Gallo Winery, Del Monte Foods, Nestle, Frito-Lay, Plastipak,
Graham Packaging, and our local Stanislaus Foods.
MET also maintains over 53 miles of track, helping
integrate California's 13th Congressional District into the
North American supply chain, including Mexico and Canada,
through connections with BNSF and the Union Pacific Railroad.
Mr. Chairman, I will discuss it more when it is my time for
questions, but I am very appreciative of Mr. Olvera being here
today. He can speak with credible fluency as to the harmful,
real-world implications of CARB's rule.
I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. Thank you, Mr. Duarte.
With that, Mr. Olvera, you are recognized for 5 minutes for
your testimony.

TESTIMONY OF DILLON OLVERA, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, MODESTO AND EMPIRE TRACTION COMPANY, ON BEHALF OF THE
AMERICAN SHORT LINE AND REGIONAL RAILROAD ASSOCIATION

Mr. Olvera. Thank you, Congressman Duarte. Good afternoon.
My name is Dillon Olvera, and I am the president and CEO of
Modesto and Empire Traction Company, affectionately called the
MET.
As a member of the American Short Line and Regional
Railroad Association, I am pleased to represent our Nation's
small freight railroad community.
The MET is a private, family-owned business, established in
1911. We have 50 employees and are a Class III short line
railroad that provides rail service to approximately 30
customers in Modesto, California.
The Central Valley is home to some of the Nation's most
important food and agricultural shippers, and our railroad
provides the first and last mile of service to those customers.
We are fortunate to connect to two Class I railroads: the Union
Pacific and the BNSF.
California short lines move roughly 260,000 carloads of
freight each year, and the MET represents 35,000 of these
carloads. Each carload carries the equivalent of three to four
trucks' worth of goods.
California's short lines operate approximately 200
locomotives, and our railroad represents 11 of those.
Most short lines equip their fleets with low-cost but
reliable and easy-to-maintain, older, second-hand locomotives,
acquired from larger Class I's.
This practical model is in compliance with Federal law, has
been in place for decades, and allows short lines to survive.
Short line locomotives, over 23 years old, which would soon
be banned under the CARB rule, are, in fact, the norm in the
industry. These locomotives cost only a few hundred thousand
dollars, while new Tier 4 locomotives cost a few million
dollars each.
Railroads are already environmentally friendly. According
to EPA data, the Nation's freight railroads account for less
than 2 percent of transportation-related greenhouse gas
emissions, and short lines make up only a tiny fraction of that
2 percent.
Our trucking competitors, meanwhile, account for 23 percent
of transportation greenhouse gas emissions. The MET has already
made great strides in reducing emissions, and we were an early
adopter of clean locomotives.
Beginning in 2008, our company worked closely with
California to apply for State grants. Nine of our eleven
locomotives were upgraded from Tier 0 to Tier 3 due to this
work.
There are three different grants in place today that have
obligations that will be completed through 2032. The total cost
of these upgrades was $12\1/2\ million, shared between
California and the MET. These locomotives have many years of
remaining useful life but would have to be scrapped and
replaced with new locomotives per the CARB regulation.
This CARB regulation will also force the MET to contribute
to a spending account while continuing to complete our grant
obligation. This is an unreasonable ask to make of any small
business.
Our current calculation for the spending account is over $1
million annually. A grant match in the spending account
emission fees would represent a massive increase in our
locomotive spend, compared to historical levels.
We also recently applied, and were awarded, CRISI grant
funding to upgrade two switch-engine locomotives from Tier 0 to
Tier 4. The total cost for this upgrade is approximately $5
million, again, to be split between the Federal Government and
the MET.
As we have demonstrated, the MET, and short lines in
general, are perfectly willing to work with CARB and other
similar agencies to reduce emissions when they offer reasonable
paths forward. But this rule is just not feasible for short
lines.
The CARB regulation will cause a significant financial
impact to the entire short line industry. Railroads are
capital-intensive, and our margins are tight. A well-run short
line frequently spends over 80 percent of revenue on operating
expenses, and contract provisions and market competition will
prevent us from raising prices to cover CARB's regulation
costs.
If short lines are driven out of business due do CARB's
unfeasible rule, that freight will move onto trucks, increase
traffic congestion and freight costs, and businesses will have
lost viable shipping options and move out of California or just
vanish.
The EPA should deny CARB's authorization request. Not only
does it mandate the use of locomotive technology that is not
currently commercially available, CARB has also publicly
acknowledged that the massive compliance costs will force short
lines out of business.
This would have a catastrophic impact on our freight rail
network, the U.S. supply chain, the environment, and highway
safety.
Thank you, and I looking forward to our discussion today.
[Mr. Olvera's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Dillon Olvera, President and Chief Executive
Officer, Modesto and Empire Traction Company, on behalf of the American
Short Line and Regional Railroad Association
Introduction
My name is Dillon Olvera, and I am the President and CEO of the
Modesto and Empire Traction Company, affectionately called the MET. MET
is a member of the American Short Line and Regional Railroad
Association (ASLRRA), the trade association that represents the
nation's more than 600 Class II and III freight railroads (commonly
known as short line railroads or short lines) and hundreds of suppliers
that support them. In this capacity I can speak to you on behalf of the
ASLRRA, representing the interests of our nationwide small railroad
industry. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today.
The MET is a private, family-owned business established in 1911.
MET is a short line railroad with 53 miles of track that provides rail
service to approximately 30 customers in Modesto, California, located
in the Central Valley of the state and employs approximately 50
employees with stable jobs and benefits. MET meets the Small Business
Administration's small business size standard. The Central Valley is
home to some of the nation's largest food and agriculture shippers. Our
railroad provides the first-mile and/or last-mile service to our
customers. We are fortunate to have access to two Class I Railroads,
connecting shippers on the MET to the Union Pacific Railroad and BNSF
Railway.

We may not be household names, but short lines are critical in your
communities and pivotal in making sure that goods and freight that your
constituents rely upon can get to their homes and businesses in a safe,
efficient, and reliable manner. Smart regulatory action by Congress in
the early 1980s helped make this possible, sparking the growth of the
short line industry and facilitating the freight rail service we
proudly provide today. Now a new regulation in California threatens
four decades of economic progress. The regulation is rooted in good
intentions--reducing greenhouse gas emissions--but it is problematic in
its application, a fundamental violation of federalism, interferes with
interstate commerce, and is based on unrealistic assumptions. Moreover,
it takes direct aim at our industry and the critical link in the supply
chain we represent. The California Air Resources Board (CARB), the
agency issuing the regulation, does get one thing right--it predicts
the demise of our industry due to the costs of its measure, noting ``it
is possible some of these businesses would be eliminated.'' \1\
(Emphasis added.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Proposed In-Use Locomotive Regulation: Standard Regulatory
Impact Assessment (SRIA) at 143.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As one of ``these businesses''--and on behalf of the families and
communities and thousands of other U.S. businesses that rely on
railroads like ours--I am here to sound the alarm. If small railroads
begin to go bankrupt simply because they cannot afford to comply with
the regulation, the effects will ripple across our supply chain,
starting in California and stretching across the country. These will be
felt in the form of higher costs for shippers and consumers and will be
witnessed in the form of more trucks on our roads, greater congestion
on our highways, more particulate matter in our environment--and,
ironically, more greenhouse gas emissions in California and elsewhere.
We appreciate the subcommittee's interest in this matter and in
providing an opportunity for our industry to speak about CARB's
misguided measure. We also appreciate the leadership that Chairman
Graves, Subcommittee Chair Nehls, and many on this panel, and others in
Congress, have shown in giving voice to our concerns and urging a
thoughtful approach to policymaking by the federal actors who have a
rightful say in these matters. This includes the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), which is currently deliberating over CARB's
authorization request. While CARB fails to recognize the competing
interests that must be balanced to achieve good policy outcomes, we
remain confident that Congress and the federal government can be
reasonable and level-headed in working with our industry to ensure that
our shared goals--clean air, a thriving freight economy, and a world
class supply chain system--are all achieved. I urge Congress to call on
EPA to deny CARB's request to authorize their In-Use Locomotive
Regulation, for the many reasons I cite in this testimony.
The Short Line Freight Rail Industry
Our industry is a great American success story. It was spurred to
new life in the early 1980s when partial deregulatory action by
Congress--the Staggers Act--allowed larger Class I railroads to spin
off moribund, outdated rail lines no longer deemed business-worthy.
Short line railroads acquired and revived these marginal lines, which
were often in very poor condition. They invested mightily, ran scrappy
and smart, knocked on every door they could find, and managed to turn
them into thriving enterprises. They have preserved freight rail
service for thousands of customers, all while working closely with
Class I railroads to ensure the network's success. Our railroads can be
seen here:

Short lines serve communities in every corner of the country

Today, short lines provide first-mile and last-mile freight rail
service and are responsible for handling one in five railcars on the
national rail system. They ensure that businesses in dense urban
centers, small towns, and isolated rural communities in 49 states that
would otherwise be cut off from the North American freight rail network
have the access they need to domestic and global markets. While we
provide a critical connection to all commodities, the manufacturing,
industrial, agricultural, mining, energy, and chemical sectors are
particularly reliant on short line service. For areas of rural and
small-town America, we are typically the only connection to the
national rail network. Indeed, our presence can be the tipping point
for businesses to locate or expand in a region, driving new family-
supporting jobs throughout the country in places that otherwise may
struggle to attract investment.
Large, mega-corporations we are not. Most of our members are small
businesses.\2\ The typical short line employs about 30 people, operates
about 80 route miles, and for those in California, makes about $1.3
million in revenue per year. While we operate approximately 30% of the
national network (or 50,000 route miles) and handle about 20% of the
freight cars in service, our members earn only about 6% of the total
revenue earned by the country's freight railroads.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ While some short lines are owned by larger companies, all must
stand on their own financially, and properties that become permanently
cash flow-negative are not viable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nonetheless, our members have a big impact on economic outcomes.
Short lines are critical links in the nation's freight supply chain,
and are vital engines of economic activity, tied to 478,000 jobs
nationwide, $26 billion in labor income and $56 billion in economic
value-add.\3\ Altogether, short lines ensure more than 10,000 critical
businesses can get their goods and products to market.\4\

Our members provide these customers with a low-carbon freight
logistics option that is more environmentally friendly than competing
forms of transportation over land, preventing costly damage to pavement
that would be borne by often cash-strapped state and local agencies. We
are proud of how we relieve traffic congestion, cutting emissions of
harmful pollutants while reducing deadly crashes. And we are proud of
our reputation for providing attentive, tailored, ``white glove''
service to a variety of shippers, making the extra effort to ensure
that rail service for any shipment size is the right logistics choice
and our customers' critical goods get where they are going on time.
Short lines are still investing limited resources to revitalize
outdated track
Even after decades of investment by short lines--often a third to
40% of their annual revenue, making short line railroading one of the
most capital-intensive businesses in the country--the backlog of
repairs still looms large. We estimate more than $12 billion is still
needed to allow short lines to fully modernize and meet the country's
freight needs. This estimate unfortunately is subject to rise due to
the hard-hitting impact of inflation on construction costs and looming
new mandates like CARB's In-Use Locomotive Regulation.
The Short Line Industry in California
California, as the nation's largest economy--and one of the world's
as well--is no stranger to short lines and typifies our profile in many
places. There are 25 short lines in my state. All are Class III
operations, but some of these run (either by owning or leasing) over
lengthy routes, for example the San Joaquin Valley Railroad at around
400 miles. The average California short line operates about 57 route
miles. Short lines like Sierra Northern Railway and Mendocino Railway
each have a few dozen employees. These small railroads move
agricultural products, petroleum products, minerals, chemicals,
plastics, lumber, and forest products--all critical to the well-being
of residents in California and millions beyond the state's borders.
Indeed, some short lines, like the Arizona & California Railroad,
operate in both states represented in the railroad's name, or in the
case of Central Oregon and Pacific Railroad, in California and its
northern neighbor. These examples emphasize the interstate, integral
nature of the short line freight rail economy. All short line
railroads, whether interstate or intrastate, are considered by the STB
to be integral parts of the freight rail network.
California short lines move roughly 260,000 carloads of freight in
California each year, and the MET represents 35,000 of these carloads,
almost 15%. Each carload carries the equivalent of 3-4 trucks worth of
goods, meaning that short lines in California alone keep roughly one
million trucks off the road. California short lines operate
approximately 200 locomotives in the state, and our railroad has 11 of
those locomotives.
Railroads are already the most environmentally friendly way to
transport freight across the country. According to EPA data, the
nation's freight railroads account for less than 2% of total
transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions, and short lines make
up only a tiny fraction of that 2%. Our trucking competitors account
for 23% of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions.
CARB's In-Use Locomotive Regulation
The new regulation and its four key provisions
For many years, CARB recognized implicitly and explicitly that
federal law prevented it from regulating the national freight rail
network. But in 2022, the agency formally bucked what was a sound,
reasonable and legally grounded position and launched the current
regulatory regime. The short line industry and our stakeholders
presented our significant economic concerns while CARB put together the
measure. But our points did not seem to carry much weight in the face
of CARB's single-minded aim of achieving an abrupt transition to zero
greenhouse gas emissions. In 2023, CARB formally promulgated the in-use
locomotive regulation, and it came into effect on January 1, 2024. Some
compliance dates have already come due and many more will come due in
the months and years ahead. These include:
1.  A mandate to spend millions on new locomotives. The
regulation's first key tenet requires railroads to set aside funds
annually into a forced ``spending account'' that can only be used to
acquire, lease, or rent certain new technologies approved by CARB,
largely limited to low-emission and zero-emission locomotives. The
amount of funds is related to the operators' emissions levels. Some
short line operators might have to spend several millions of dollars
annually to comply with this mandate, potentially exceeding the annual
revenue of these companies, much less any profit. The fees levied on
locomotive emissions are deliberately scaled to make operation of even
locomotives that are fully compliant with EPA's emissions tiers up to
Tier 3 prohibitively expensive and the operation of Tier 4 compliant
locomotives very expensive--even though all these locomotives are
compliant with federal law.

2.  A requirement that currently useful locomotives stop operating
in California. The regulation's second key tenet is operational in
focus, mandating that by 2030, locomotives for switcher, industrial and
passenger use cannot operate in California unless they are under 23
years old and meet the newest emissions criteria or are zero-emission.
By 2035, all locomotives in line-haul use must meet these criteria.
This means that locomotives purchased before 2007, which could have
many decades of valuable, useful life left, will be banned in the
state. Short line fleets largely consist of used locomotives acquired
on the secondary market. It is rare to find a locomotive under a decade
old on a short line property. Most are over 23 years old, some far
over. Many short lines have only locomotives that are over 23 years
old.

3.  A limit on the length of time a railroad may remain stationary
without turning off its engine. Locomotives with an ``automatic engine
start/stop'' device must be ``shut off no more than 30 minutes after
the locomotive becomes stationary,'' in most instances. Railroads must
track any idling over this duration, and report the cause, a
substantial administrative burden.

4.  A mandate for new recordkeeping. The fourth and final element
requires railroads to report annually to the state specific emissions
information and operating practices.
MET's Experience in California
The MET has already made great strides in reducing greenhouse gas
emissions. In fact, the MET was an early adopter of clean locomotives.
Beginning in 2008, our company worked closely with the state of
California to apply for state grants. There are nine locomotives that
were upgraded from Tier 0 to Tier 3 due to this work and California's
investments. There are three different grants in place today that have
obligations that will be completed between 2026 through 2032, which are
as follows:

Funding from the Diesel Emission Reduction Act program,
which will be complete in 2026, and help invest in two locomotives;

Funding from California's Carl Moyer program, which will
be complete in 2028 and help invest in an additional two locomotives;
and

Funding from San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution
Control District, which will be complete in 2032 and help with
investments for five locomotives.

The total cost of these upgrades is $12.5 million dollars. The cost
of these upgrades was shared between the state of California and the
MET. These locomotives have many years of remaining useful life, but
they would all have to be scrapped and replaced with new locomotives
per the CARB regulation. The useful life of a locomotive operated by a
short line is typically 40+ years, however, the CARB regulation calls
for the elimination of all locomotives that have an age of 23 years or
greater. This CARB regulation will also force the MET to contribute to
a spending account while continuing to complete our grant obligation.
This is an unreasonable ask for any small business to make. With the
present fleet mix, our current calculation for the spending account is
over $1.0 million dollars annually, which is an unsustainable
percentage of revenue. This spending account creates a use-it-or-lose-
it monetary incentive to force locomotive upgrades. As demonstrated by
our previous work together, the MET, and short lines in general, are
perfectly willing to work with CARB and other similar agencies to
reduce emissions when they offer reasonable paths forward, particularly
on help acquiring newer and cleaner locomotives. This regulation,
however, is just not feasible for us.
The CARB regulation will cause a significant financial impact to
the entire short line industry. Railroads are capital-intensive and
well-run short line railroads frequently spend at least 80% of revenue
on operating expenses and basic upkeep. Short lines are also frequently
prevented by contract provisions and/or market competition from trucks
from effectively raising prices to cover CARB regulation's costs.

MET genset locomotive and train operations

The MET recently applied for and was awarded CRISI grant funding to
upgrade two SW1500 switch engine locomotives from tier 0 to tier 4. The
total cost for these upgrades is approximately $5 million dollars, to
be split between the federal government and the MET.
The CARB regulation's spending account ``funding requirement'' is
charged on a sliding scale based on emissions that is calculated to
make the operation of a locomotive that is EPA Tier 3-compliant, or
less, prohibitively expensive. This practically forces the operator to
upgrade to a Tier 4 or zero emission locomotive. In the case of MET,
the cost to operate the recently upgraded Tier 3 locomotives under the
new regulation would rapidly become prohibitive. For that reason, MET
has submitted another application for CRISI funding to repower the 9
Tier 3 gensets to Tier 4. This dynamic displays the profound conflicts
that have been created between prior state policy, present federal
policy, and the In-Use Locomotive Regulation. Tier 3 locomotive engines
that are quite low-emitting and were acquired with public assistance,
and that are legal under today's EPA regulations, are forced to be
scrapped with decades of useful life remaining, becoming ``stranded
assets.''
Even with the entire MET fleet upgraded to Tier 4, the spending
account requirement would still require MET to deposit hundreds of
thousands of dollars each year into its account. The zero emission
locomotives promoted as available today are, in our assessment, still
in early development. They are not yet an economically or physically
practical option that could reliably, effectively, and cost-effectively
meet the operational requirements at our active railroad.
This forced diversion of funds, even considering support from state
and federal sources, still reflects a massive increase from our
historical baseline of locomotive capital expenditure and a pulling
forward of decades of that investment. It is orders of magnitude
greater than what was spent in the past. This forces tradeoffs in
valuable investments that otherwise would have been made at the MET.
One is investments in improved track condition, an important driver of
safety that reduces derailment risk. Another is investment in public
at-grade crossing protection. MET serves a busy industrial park with 50
crossings with varying degrees of protection. This diversion of funding
occurs at the expense of investments to improve protection levels at
crossings.
Finally, if short lines are driven out of business due to CARB's
infeasible regulation, that freight will move onto trucks, increasing
damage to roads, increasing traffic congestion and freight cost, and
impacting traffic safety. Businesses who have lost shipping options
will move out of California or just vanish.
The Problems Presented by CARB's New Regulation
There are a broad array of problems awaiting California and the
nation's freight economy due to CARB's regulation. But the following
five are those that our industry finds the most fundamental and
concerning.
The regulation is preempted by federal law
The nation's rail industry has been around 200 years, and it is the
poster child for interstate commerce. California's actions effectively
regulate the national network and the interstate commerce it supports.
It is logical that no state should be able to regulate the national
rail network any more than it can regulate the national airspace and
the interstate commerce that relies on our aviation system. Two
centuries of jurisprudence interpreting the Commerce Clause as well as
several federal statutes, among them the Interstate Commerce Commission
Termination Act (ICCTA) and the Clean Air Act and the Locomotive
Inspection Act, all clearly render CARB's regulation illegal. Freight
trains and railcars are constantly moving between states on an
integrated and interoperable network demonstrating every day the
inherently national characteristic of the freight rail industry.
We understand the proper venue for our legal arguments is in court,
and ASLRRA is engaged in ongoing litigation with CARB alongside the
Association of American Railroads (AAR). We are confident in those
proceedings, but we regret that litigation is necessary to stem
regulatory activity that never should have been seriously contemplated
in the first place. We also remain eager to work with Congress to
advance legislative efforts and support federal administrative activity
that asserts the rightful federal primacy over our country's freight
rail network.
The regulation mandates technology that does not exist in a viable form
and at scale, and that may not for years to come
CARB's regulation is replete with faulty assumptions about current
technological capabilities, the direction they are going, and the scale
and timing of new developments.
The regulation requires that over the next decade, railroads
acquire and use locomotive technology that is low-emission, and
eventually, zero-emission. While an admirable goal, this requires the
locomotive manufacturing industry to make massive leaps in development
in just a few short years. To go from the current situation, in which
there are not proven commercially viable zero-emission freight
locomotives or adequate manufacturing capacity in North America, to one
in which there are thousands running throughout California and many
other states from which goods and freight might move into and out of
California is impossible based on realistic commercial testing and
manufacturing timelines.
Locomotives are massive, complex machines designed to haul heavy,
voluminous amounts of freight. These are not 4,000-pound Tesla EVs
moving a few bags of groceries around the neighborhood. The locomotives
in use today must be capable of hauling hundreds if not thousands or
tens of thousands of tons (i.e., trains generally weigh well into the
millions of pounds) of stone, grain, chemicals and other heavy goods
and commodities in demanding weather conditions such as the high heat
in the San Joaquin Valley, or through California's Sierra Nevada
mountains in the depths of winter, for hours on end. As impressive as
advances have been in battery technology in recent years, they pale in
comparison to the advances that would be necessary to outfit a
locomotive to ensure it can reliably move strings of massive railcars.
The most efficient batteries in use today would need to demonstrate a
greater than tenfold increase in capacity to achieve CARB's aims--and a
swift ability to recharge that is not possible with today's technology.
As much as our industry would like to see that happen, there is no path
forward yet for that technology to be achieved--just writing it into a
state regulation does not make it so.
The same applies to other new technologies, like alternative fuels,
hydrogen, and hydrogen fuel cells. These efforts, while moving quickly
and with our full support and participation, are still in a nascent
stage--nowhere near the readiness necessary to justify scrapping years
of investments in diesel engines and stranding tens of thousands of
perfectly functional locomotives.
The regulation ignores how short lines acquire and use locomotives and
the fundamental short line business model
Just as CARB-mandated technology remains many years away from the
market, it is farther still from any secondary market where our members
could realistically afford to acquire the technology and incorporate it
into their operations.
The rail industry engages in a practice known as ``cascading,''
where used locomotives from Class I railroads are sold to short lines,
as the Class I's locomotive models are replaced with newer motive
power. A locomotive that has reached its practical end of life in Class
I service can have decades of use left in the less punishing short line
operating environment. This has been a bedrock principle of railroad
operating economics from the advent of interstate railroading. It is an
economic win-win that benefits all involved in rail: the Class Is, the
short lines, and the shippers that depend upon efficient, cost-
effective, and safe rail transportation as an alternative to higher-
cost truck transportation.
California's ban on any locomotive older than 23 years old
beginning in 2030 is a completely unworkable proposal for short line
railroads that regularly rely on
30-, 40- and 50-year-old locomotives, which are fully compliant with
federal law, to keep sometimes barely marginal railroads viable.
Departing from that economic model and requiring smaller railroads to
purchase dramatically more expensive locomotives would lead to the ruin
of many short lines. The difference in capital costs for short lines
between acquiring new versus used locomotives is not a few percentage
points, it is an order of magnitude. The nature of short lines, that
these costs must be spread over the fewer cars that short lines
typically handle on a per mile basis, renders this path completely non-
viable.
The regulation ignores the operational complexities created by
mandating new technology
CARB's approach fails to recognize the levels of complexity that
come with upgrading locomotives to progressive tiers. With each tier,
maintenance intervals are shorter, maintenance activities are more
elaborate, repairs become more costly and are borne by operators who
are still building familiarity with their new technology.
The latest Tier 4 compliant locomotives--also the newest on the
market--are dramatically more complex machines than the lower tier
locomotives commonly found at short lines, in terms of the engines,
electronic controls and monitoring systems. The step from Tier 3 to
Tier 4 is notable for these impacts. Locomotive maintenance personnel
require substantial additional training, more consumables and spares
must be kept on hand, and fleets may even have to be sized differently
to address lower-than-expected availability levels. CARB does not seem
to have fully considered the effect of this dynamic--it will
disproportionately impact smaller operators of locomotives with small
maintenance shops.
The regulation evades any effort to recognize how it will uniquely
affect small businesses
A longstanding body of law, including the Regulatory Flexibility
Act of 1980 (RFA), as modified by the Small Business Regulatory
Enforcement and Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), requires that federal
agencies exercise utmost care and discretion in evaluating how
regulations they promulgate affect small businesses. While not bound by
these laws, CARB has clearly ignored their wisdom in creating a
prescriptive, costly, and complex new regulatory framework. Many small
railroads are unable to comply with ``one size fits all'' requirements
that are written with larger entities in mind. Each small railroad has
a unique operating environment that can differ dramatically from others
in terms of scale, market, operating characteristics, capital needs,
and price sensitivity of shippers served. It is no wonder that the U.S.
Small Business Administration's (SBA) Office of Advocacy has formally
weighed in on CARB's authorization request to EPA, noting its harms and
how it ``will disproportionately impact small businesses in the
locomotive sector as well as small entities who depend on the
locomotive sector.'' \5\

Administration to U.S. EPA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Broad Harm the Regulation Will Bring
California short lines will face massive new costs with some forced to
shutter
As noted above, CARB's regulation imposes new costs that come in
the form of massive, mandated capital expenditures on locomotive fleet
replacements and upgrades, and on an infeasible timetable.
A Class III railroad in California, as CARB notes in their
regulatory analysis, can have cost of compliance with the new
regulation as high as 42% of annual revenue for a short line.\6\ For
more than a decade, the spread in cost between an older, lower-tier
used locomotive in good condition and a brand-new unit has been
dramatic--from a few hundred thousand dollars for used equipment
contrasted with over $4 million for a small-order purchase of a new
Tier 4-compliant locomotive. The long-term financial planning of short
lines has been constructed around the former; but with whiplash speed,
to comply with CARB's regulation, short lines must jettison their time-
tested economic model and focus on new, lavishly more expensive
machinery than they need.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ CARB Standardized Regulatory Impact Assessment (SRIA) at 95;
ASLRRA notes this estimate may be low.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We estimate that between $335 to $427 million will be required to
upgrade the short line freight locomotive fleet currently operating in
California. We believe our state's short lines operate 172 locomotives
that would need to be replaced. This cost over and above the normal
cost is due to the difference in investment between repowering
locomotives versus purchasing completely new locomotives. The cost
would be even higher if zero-emission locomotives were required,
because, for battery-electric powered locomotives, there is a high
probability that small rail operations now using one or two diesel
locomotives would require two or three battery locomotives, due to the
recharging periods for the batteries requiring more time than simply
refueling a diesel-electric locomotive. A small railroad would be
required to provide back-up locomotives in case of an issue with the
new zero-emission technology that takes it out of service. Unlike a
larger railroad that to a degree may be able to reshuffle its
locomotive assignments to cover for individual locomotive failures,
small railroads do not have that ability and will be required to build
in a back-up plan to provide service continuity to their customers.
CARB makes unrealistic assumptions that short lines can pass on
these new, mandated compliance costs to their customers. Many short
line shippers are small to medium sized businesses themselves and most
operate in sectors with razor-thin profit margins and intense
competitive pressures; there is nothing to ``pass on'' that customers
will not feel acutely as well. When short line customers are met with
new higher rail shipping costs, they will be forced to turn to other
means, like trucking, in response. A downward spiral would then
commence, with many short lines seeing costs soar, customers flee or be
forced to shutter, revenue nosedive, and bankruptcy or abandonment of
lines as the end state.
CARB has included two provisions in the regulation ostensibly to
reduce the burden on small businesses: the Alternative Compliance Plan
(ACP) and the Small Business Hardship Extension. Both measures enable
regulated railroads to delay compliance with some elements of the
regulation for periods of time, but they entail substantial reporting
burdens and neither addresses the basic challenge, that under the
regulation, inevitably, and on approximately the same terminal
timeline, short line railroads will be forced to make a massive
investment in Tier 4 locomotives--or zero-emission locomotives, if ever
practical and available--that will be many times the motive power
investments that would have been expected to support their operations
under the legal framework prior to the ruling. The costs imposed by the
regulation will remain as insurmountable for small businesses under the
Alternative Compliance Plan and with the Small Business Hardship
Extensions structure as they would under normal compliance. In the case
of the ACP, the locomotive operator must have control over non-
locomotive assets that emit, and which can be controlled to attain
equivalent emissions reductions. Few if any short lines have such
assets.
For those railroads that do remain in business, safety will suffer,
as they will be forced to shelve critical upgrades and maintenance,
investing less in addressing the leading cause of derailments on short
lines: outdated rail and track. CARB's mandates will supplant those
needs, jeopardizing the railroads' operations. Sensible environmental
upgrades will be halted, too, as intermediate EPA tier improvements
that could result in significant reductions in emissions, like our
investments in Tier 3 locomotives, would effectively be disincentivized
by CARB in favor of maximalist targets.
With short lines gone, the state's supply chain and economy will
suffer, and residents will encounter new health and safety
hazards
Short lines represent about a third of California's rail network.
With the new regulation placing those businesses on the brink and
pushing some into bankruptcy, California's supply chain is in for a
torrent of trouble.
Businesses will still have goods and freight to ship to market, but
with fewer options available, customers will have to increasingly move
products via large trucks and commercial motor vehicles. This can be
four to five times more expensive than shipping by rail. With the
trucking industry taking freight that previously moved by rail, the
pressure upon short lines could continue further through ``modal
diversion.'' Even short lines that initially weather CARB's regulation
will find a freight marketplace where they are slowly supplanted by
trucking. With few short lines left, California could see companies
flee the state in search of locations with better rail and shipping
options.
Aware of this cascade of new costs and limited options for shipping
their products, it is not surprising that 25 national and 50 state
agriculture groups--from California and throughout the country--are on
record opposing this regulation, deeming it a ``significant danger to
U.S. agriculture and the broader U.S. supply chain.'' \7\ The
agriculture industry is joined by hundreds of other business groups,
manufacturers, energy firms, defense groups and even the National
Association of Counties. Like us, these groups all rightly predict the
elimination of shipping options and the increased costs that will come
with whatever shipping options remain--costs that will be passed on
eventually to consumers, your constituents.

Association of Manufacturers and hundreds of agriculture and industrial

0574-0001/comment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the sticker shock of higher shipping costs were not enough,
Californians could quickly see a staggering number of additional trucks
on their roads. We estimate short lines ship about 260,000 carloads per
year that could in large measure be forced onto roadways in California,
and each rail carload is the equivalent of 3 to 4 trucks. One short
line predicts the loss of just its rail traffic alone will put as many
as 100,000 more trucks on California's roads per year.
With more trucks dominating California's public roadways, the
state's residents will be greeted with more greenhouse gas emissions in
the near term, as even CARB's ambitious regulatory timeline, assuming
it survives judicial scrutiny, only suggests that the truck fleet will
reach zero emissions in 2045. Moreover, Californians will breathe in
particulate matter, also known as particle pollution, generated from
billions of microscopic pieces of shredded tires that will be generated
from all the trucks newly traversing their towns and communities, on
roadways they share with big trucks. Heavier trucks--many weighing in
at 80,000 pounds--will shorten the lifespan of public roads and bridges
throughout the state. Finally, the greatest concern is one of safety.
More trucks on roadways invite the risk of more crashes and collisions
with passenger vehicles.
Even a completely electrified trucking industry would still produce
many of these new harms. Regardless of any possible rapid adoption of
electric trucks in California, these vehicles will still generate
particulate matter emissions from tire wear, and electric trucks will
still impose wear and tear on pavement and bridges. Their safety threat
is not mitigated in any way by their fuel source, rather, it may only
be compounded as trucks grow heavier to accommodate massive battery
packs. Electric trucks are considerably heavier than diesel trucks,
reducing the payload. So yet even more electric trucks (or heavier
trucks) will be required to absorb the modal diversion resulting in
more road damage and safety concerns.
The impacts will ripple out nationwide
Due to the integrated, interconnected nature of the freight rail
network and the freight economy, other states will experience these
impacts. Should EPA authorize this regulation, other states that could
move quickly to replicate it, which would threaten short lines around
the nation. The map below illustrates states that have adopted some or
all of California's criteria pollutant vehicle emissions standards
under section 177 of the Clean Air Act.
[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

CAA section 177 states

Considering this demonstrated past propagation of California
requirements for emissions standards, it is reasonable to expect
numerous other states to consider enacting new regulations on
locomotive emissions modeled on the CARB regulation. States that are
favorable to additional emissions mandates could be willing to take the
California defense of this regulation at face value and proceed
promptly to adoption.
As we speak, EPA is considering CARB's authorization request. The
effect of the spread of the CARB regulation would be to build a
disconnected patchwork of state regimes for locomotive emissions that
would prevent the movement of locomotives across state borders, even
when on the same railroad, creating geographically captive fleets. This
would impact Class I railroad operations fundamentally, but also Class
II and III railroads as many small railroads also have lines that cross
state borders, and, regardless, all railroads and rail customers depend
on the smooth flow of interstate commerce. Such a potential propagation
of the CARB regulation, following the scale and pattern illustrated
above, would dramatically multiply the financial burden projected for
California short lines across hundreds of small railroads and thousands
of locomotives.
What Congress Can Do
Call on EPA to deny CARB's request
The Clean Air Act requires EPA, following certain administrative
procedures, to authorize California to adopt and enforce standards
relating to the control of emissions from non-road engines and vehicles
otherwise not prohibited under the Clean Air Act if California
determines that its standards will be at least as protective of public
health and welfare as applicable federal standards. EPA is required to
reject such standards, however, if they are (1) arbitrary and
capricious; (2) unnecessary to meet compelling and extraordinary
conditions; or (3) inconsistent with certain provisions in the Clean
Air Act.
We firmly believe CARB's In-Use Locomotive Regulation fails this
standard, and, along with the Class I railroads and thousands of
affected stakeholders, we are actively engaged with EPA conveying the
clarity of our case and urging the agency to reject California's
request. We are appreciative of all on this panel and in Congress who
have formally asked for a denial of the request. Your efforts could
help sideline this new regulatory effort. EPA's review is ongoing. By
calling on the EPA to deny CARB's request, you are asserting proper
federal primacy over the national freight network, in general rejecting
an unworkable and inefficient patchwork of state-by-state rail
regulations and stopping this infeasible counter-productive California
regulation from becoming the de facto new national regulation.
Continue to partner with our industry to advance emissions-reducing
technology
An additional problem with CARB's mandate is that there is nowhere
near enough public or private sector funding to allow short line
railroads to quickly and comprehensively adopt even currently existing
technology that could lead to lower emissions across all in-service
locomotives. CARB has also drastically overstated federal and state
funding opportunities that short lines could avail themselves of in
efforts to comply; by our estimate, federal and state programs are
hundreds of millions of dollars short of what would be necessary just
for locomotive operations in California.
Nonetheless, there are important resources that can continue to
help our industry move in the direction we all want to go--a rail
network that has an even smaller emissions footprint than it has today
and is an even more attractive option for the surface transportation of
freight. These efforts include the USDOT's CRISI program (noted above),
which can provide funding for short lines to upgrade locomotives for
emissions purposes, and the other R&D efforts and demonstration
projects noted above. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
(IIJA), Congress has the authority to appropriate up to a billion
dollars each year to CRISI for the next two fiscal years. Full funding
will help further that aim, as well as other safety and reliability
goals. We also urge support for the EPA's Clean Ports program and its
Diesel Emissions Reduction Act program. We continue to support varied
R&D efforts with federal agencies with jurisdiction of these matters,
including efforts with US DOT and DOE to research alternative fuels,
battery electric locomotives and hydrogen fuel cells. For example, we
support DOE's Decarbonization of Off-Road, Rail, Marine, and Aviation
Technologies (DORMA) program. We urge Congress to strongly support this
and similar efforts in Fiscal Year 2025.
Railroads, however, cannot be held responsible for ensuring
dramatic advances in industries far outside of our control, such as
those manufacturing battery power solutions. We support, and urge
Congress to support, efforts at the DOE and the USDOT, aimed at the
basic research and development necessary to advance the industries and
technologies that will be necessary for rail and other hard-to-
decarbonize industries to use to dramatically reduce our environmental
footprint, such as batteries, hydrogen, and renewable diesel fuels.
Support the rail industry
Compared to the other options, rail is the more sustainable way to
move goods and freight over land, a more cost-effective option for all
manner of businesses, and a proven way to improve safety on public
roads. By supporting this industry, you do great service to your
constituents--and simultaneously help advance the goal we share with
CARB: achieving cleaner air. There are a multitude of ways we encourage
you to support freight rail: advancing efforts like CRISI to ensure
short lines can stay safe, reliable and efficient; avoiding excessive
subsidization of less-environmentally friendly shipping alternatives
like trucking by allowing heavier trucks or allowing the trucking
industry to avoid paying its fair share for use of the highway system;
and ensuring that federal and state regulations make good sense and
meet a true need.
Closing
The EPA should deny CARB's authorization request for its In-Use
Locomotive Regulation. Not only does it mandate the use of locomotives
with technology not currently commercially available, but CARB has also
publicly acknowledged that the massive compliance costs may be too much
for some short line railroads in California to bear--they would be
forced to cease operating because of their inability to comply with an
impossible regulation. This would have serious, negative impacts on the
freight rail network, the U.S. supply chain, the environment, and
highway safety. This regulation will have noticeable impact to your
constituents in elevated pricing of goods, and loss of jobs because of
the shuttering of railroads and shippers unable to obtain efficient
transportation options.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mr. Olvera.
I now recognize Mr. Nober for 5 minutes for your testimony.
Yes, sir.

TESTIMONY OF ROGER NOBER, DIRECTOR, GW REGULATORY STUDIES
CENTER AND PROFESSOR OF PRACTICE AT THE TRACHTENBERG SCHOOL OF
PUBLIC POLICY AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, GEORGE WASHINGTON
UNIVERSITY

Mr. Nober. Good morning, subcommittee Chairman Nehls,
Ranking Member Wilson, full committee Ranking Member Larsen,
and members of the subcommittee. My name is Roger Nober, and I
am honored to be back testifying on the important topic of
today's hearing: an examination of issues related to CARB's in-
use locomotive regulations.
Earlier this week, I submitted my full written testimony
and will not repeat it now. But today, I would like to draw on
my background, my experiences on this committee as the lead
staffer on the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act
of 1995, as well as subsequently chairing the Surface
Transportation Board, and then as an executive vice president
of BNSF Railway, and focus on three main points for my written
testimony:
First, provide you all with a brief history of the
Interstate Commerce Act preemption provisions; second, explain
why I believe the CARB regulations, whether or not authorized
by EPA under section 209 of the Clean Air Act, are preempted by
the Interstate Commerce Act; and third, review effective
nonpreempted alternatives for lowering locomotive emissions and
improving air quality in California today.
So, let's turn to the Interstate Commerce Act preemption.
Section 10501 of the Interstate Commerce Act broadly preempts
both State and Federal laws or regulations that affect rates,
classifications, rules, practices, route services, and the
facilities of such carriers.
This provision was intentionally written to be extremely
broad and reflects the bipartisan desire of committee members
to ensure that railroads were exclusively regulated in those
areas at the Federal level.
Importantly, the section preempted other Federal laws as
well. Over the past 30 years, section 10501 has been read
broadly, although not literally.
State and local laws that might be preempted from applying
to railroads, like sanitation codes and environmental reviews,
have been found to still apply to them.
But State efforts to regulate railroad operations through
creative actions, such as those we are reviewing today, have
been disallowed.
When another Federal law is thought to conflict with
section 10501, the STB or courts will attempt to harmonize the
laws or regulations. If they cannot be harmonized, then the
conflicting Federal law will be preempted.
All right. So, turning to the CARB in-use locomotive rules,
in my view, the CARB regulations are unequivocally preempted by
section 10501. I come to this conclusion when considering the
following:
The plain language of section 10501 and its clear and
unambiguous intent;
The fact that CARB has petitioned the EPA to open a Tier 5
locomotive rulemaking, and while the EPA has not yet done so,
it is still studying the issue;
The broad intent and scope of the CARB regulations and that
they effectively apply to equipment entering California and not
just equipment local to California;
The practical infeasibility of creating a California-only
locomotive fleet means that the CARB regulations would become
de facto national standards;
There is the technical and commercial infeasibility of
zero-emissions technology in the CARB regulation's timelines,
and the uncertainty created by two progress evaluations;
The attempt by CARB to influence equipment manufacture
through definition of ``in-use'' and the reality that
conforming locomotives do not yet feasibly exist;
The economic impact of and the penalty-like nature of
spending;
And as Mr. Olvera just mentioned, the impossibility of
small railroads' compliance with these requirements.
I also believe that were EPA to grant CARB section 209
petition, the CARB regulations could not be harmonized with the
Interstate Commerce Act and would be preempted.
As a matter of statutory construction, section 10501 is the
later enactment of law, that section 209(e) is more specific is
not important here. A later enacted, broad, preemption
provision need not list every statute that it might apply to.
So, what are the alternatives? CARB, in its testimony, has
indicated that the legal prohibitions give locomotives a,
quote, ``free pass,'' and conclude that railroads need to do
their part to improve air quality in California--and I
absolutely agree. Locomotive emissions should be reduced but
not on a national--on a national and not on a State basis.
Going forward, the best step long term would be an EPA Tier
5 regulation. CARB, as I said, has sought such a rulemaking as
recently as 2017, and EPA has not refused to do so.
While a Tier 5 rulemaking might be slow and laborious, EPA
would also consider the national implications of such a rule
and imbalance improving emissions profiles with mode and route
shifts that nationally might increase overall emissions
exposure to more people.
In the short term, CARB and local air quality districts in
California could also negotiate voluntary agreements with
railroads. These agencies, for decades, understood the value of
voluntary agreements to reduce locomotive emissions, and they
have produced real benefits to California residents, and I
believe that they could again.
In conclusion, I believe that these regulations are legally
preempted and substantively the wrong way to reduce locomotive
emissions. I ask the committee not to lose sight of the larger
picture, which is that rail is the most environmentally
friendly mode of surface transportation.
As a result, locomotive emissions regulation should not let
the perfect, which is adopting unavailable zero-emissions
technology by a date certain and penalizing those who don't, be
the enemy of the outstanding, which is moving as much freight
on rail as possible, using the most efficient rail equipment
commercially feasible.
So, thank you again for inviting me to testify this
afternoon, and I look forward to any questions you might have.
[Mr. Nober's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Roger Nober, Director, GW Regulatory Studies
Center and Professor of Practice at the Trachtenberg School of Public
Policy and Public Administration, George Washington University
Good afternoon, Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Wilson and members
of the Subcommittee.
My name is Roger Nober, and I am here to present testimony on legal
and practical concerns with the adoption of regulations promulgated by
the California Air Resources Board (CARB) (hereafter the CARB
regulations) and CARB's subsequent petition to the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to allow CARB to regulate
locomotive emissions when such locomotives are in use in the State of
California.
My Background
I am currently the Director of the GW Regulatory Studies Center
housed in the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public
Administration at the George Washington University and a Professor of
Practice at the Trachtenberg School. I have been in this position since
the start of 2024. I testify today in this capacity only.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center
works to improve regulatory policy through research, education, and
outreach. This statement reflects my own views and does not represent
an official position of the GW Regulatory Studies Center or the George
Washington University.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prior to joining the GW Regulatory Studies Center, I had over 30
years' professional experience in transportation, focusing on legal
issues, legislation, policy and operations. From the beginning of 2007
until I retired at the end of 2022, I was the Executive Vice President
for Law and Corporate Affairs at BNSF Railway Company, the nation's
largest freight railroad. At BNSF, I was a Board Member of BNSF LLC and
led the legal, environmental, communications, compliance, State
government affairs and regulatory functions. Among my duties, my teams
worked with State and local air resource agencies in California (and
numerous other states) on issues ranging from locomotive emissions to
permitting of new intermodal facilities. I also was a consultant for
BNSF following my retirement during calendar year 2023.
Prior to joining BNSF, I served as the Chairman of the United
States Surface Transportation Board (STB) from 2002 to 2006. I was
confirmed by the Senate in November of 2002 and appointed by President
Bush as Chairman when I was administered the oath of office. I served
as STB Chairman until my departure in January of 2006. During my time
as Chairman, I had the unusual circumstance of being the only Board
Member for 54 weeks in 2003 and 2004. After leaving the STB I was a
partner at Steptoe & Johnson in Washington DC for the balance of 2006.
Prior to being confirmed as an STB Member, from June of 2001 until
November of 2002 I served at the Department of Transportation, where I
was the Counselor to Deputy Secretary Michael P. Jackson and the
Aviation Policy Assistant to Secretary Norman Y. Mineta.
Prior to joining the Department of Transportation, I was a staff
member to the Republican Members of this Committee serving in a variety
of roles from 1993 until 2001. I began as a Minority Counsel on the
Subcommittee on Surface Transportation in the 103rd Congress (when the
full Committee was known as the Public Works and Infrastructure
Committee) under Ranking Member Bud Shuster. In 1995, at the start of
the 104th Congress, I became the Majority Counsel for the Subcommittee
on Highways and Transit of the renamed Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee, which had also gained jurisdiction over
freight and intercity railroads from the Energy and Commerce Committee
in a 1995 House Committee reorganization under then Chairman Shuster. I
subsequently became the Full Committee Chief Counsel and in that role
was involved in the passage of numerous significant pieces of
legislation. Most importantly for this hearing, in 1995 I was the lead
House staffer on the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of
1995 (ICCTA), the legislation to terminate the Interstate Commerce
Commission (ICC), create the STB and significantly revise the
Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) with respect to interstate rail carriers
and motor carriers.
I have been an adjunct professor of law at Texas A&M University and
Southern Methodist University Law Schools teaching Administrative Law,
and I am teaching a course on Administrative Law at the Trachtenberg
School in the Fall of 2024. I am a Member of the Advisory Boards at the
Texas A&M Transportation Institute, the Northwestern University
Transportation Center and the Board of Directors of the Eno Center for
Transportation.
Background to Today's Hearing
As the Members of the Committee are aware, in April of 2017 CARB
petitioned the EPA to open a so-called Tier 5 locomotive rulemaking--in
other words asking EPA to revise locomotive emissions standards to make
them more stringent. In November of 2022, the EPA responded by
promising to create a working group to examine how best to address
emissions from locomotives and initiate a rulemaking to examine federal
preemption of State regulations governing locomotive emissions. In
April of 2023, CARB adopted its in use locomotive standards
(significantly revised in September 2023). In November of 2023, CARB
petitioned the EPA under section 209(e) of the Clean Air Act to
delegate to CARB the regulation of locomotives when in the State of
California so that CARB had the legal authority to put those standards
into effect under the federal Clean Air Act law (hereafter the CARB
petition).
CARB and numerous commentators have discussed the many practical
and technical issues in the CARB regulations in depth and I will not
repeat that analysis here. I also submitted comments to EPA regarding
CARB petition and would like to include those by reference here as
well. https://regulatorystudies.columbian.
gwu.edu/carb-regulating-use-locomotives.
In these comments, I focus on the application of the ICA to most
significant portions of the CARB regulations, the legal conflict that
EPA's granting of the CARB petition would create under the ICA and then
review alternative approaches for lowering locomotive emissions in
California.
CARB In Use Locomotive Regulation and Petition to EPA
In sum, the CARB regulations have the following components:

A prohibition as of 2030 on the operation of locomotives
older than 23 years old in the State of California, meaning any
locomotive originally manufactured before 2007 unless that locomotive
is in zero emissions configuration.

Imposition of charges on certain locomotives that operate
in California which do not meet zero emissions standards set forth in
the regulations beginning on January 1, 2025 with the first deposits
due July 1, 2026;

A direction that those charges be deposited into a
``spending account'' that the payors can only use to purchase certain
specified types of locomotives or zero emissions infrastructure support
facilities;

Mandates that (i) yard and switch locomotives
manufactured after 2030 must operate in zero emissions configuration
and (ii) road locomotives manufactured after 2035 must operate in zero
emissions configuration in California;

Setting of additional locomotive idling requirements; and

Imposition of statewide locomotive registration and
reporting requirements.

While CARB has relied upon its own findings that conforming
locomotives will be available by the specified dates, CARB also appears
to recognize that the technological feasibility of zero emissions
linehaul locomotives is uncertain, and the CARB regulations include a
provision to conduct ``progress assessments'' in 2027 and 2032. The
results of those assessments could lead to extending the deadlines in
the regulations.
The CARB petition to EPA is to delegate to California the authority
to adopt the CARB regulations and regulate locomotives in California
pursuant to section 209(e) of the Clean Air Act. The CARB regulations
are ostensibly limited in application to California alone, but the CARB
petition recognizes the potential effects of the CARB regulations on
locomotive manufacturers, interstate movement of goods, and the
regulatory requirements of other states. Seen as a whole, I believe
these actions reveal CARB's apparent intent to create a technology-
forcing set of requirements to hasten zero emission locomotive
development and deployment, not just in California, but nationally.
Interstate Commerce Act Preemption
Based on my experiences on the Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee, as Chairman of the Surface Transportation Board and as an
Executive Vice President at BNSF Railway and now as a regulatory
scholar, I believe that the CARB regulations that are the subject of
the CARB petition are unambiguously preempted by Section 10501 of the
ICA, 49 USC 10501. In this section I would like to explain why I
believe this is so by first recounting the history of section 10501 and
what I believe the Committee's intent was in enacting it, and then
examining its application to the CARB petition and CARB regulations.
1. Background
A foundational principle of interstate commerce is the need for
uniformity in operations across the fifty states. In my 31 years of
experience, maintaining national uniformity through preemption of State
regulation has been a longstanding bi-partisan priority of this
Committee. The reasons are straightforward. Most commerce, on
waterways, in surface transportation or in air cargo is interstate in
nature. National rules for economic, safety and operational regulation
facilitate our national system of freight movements. State regulation
creates an unworkable and inefficient patchwork of rules and
requirements.
As the Members of this Committee are well aware, most freight and
passenger transportation economic regulations were eliminated or
modified in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Those deregulatory efforts
have brought American consumers and business tremendous value in the
decades since; it is no exaggeration to state that America's freight
transportation is the envy of the world and a significant competitive
advantage for the American economy. Maintaining national economic,
operating and safety standards through preemption of State regulation
of interstate commerce remained core to those deregulatory efforts.
When I joined the Minority staff of the Public Works and Transportation
Committee in 1993, there were only a few remnants of State regulation
left in transportation, but one inadvertent vestige was causing
competitive harm and needed to be addressed.
By 1993, Federal aviation laws had clearly preempted State
regulation of intrastate movements of air carriers, but the ICA, which
governed movements subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC, still
permitted States to economically regulate intrastate movements of motor
carriers of property that were not part of an interstate movement. The
practical effect of this discrepancy was a difference in regulation at
the State level between FedEx, which originated as an air carrier but
by the 1990s owned significant trucking assets, and UPS, which
originated as a motor carrier but by the 1990s owned thousands of
aircraft. While UPS and FedEx had very similar businesses, since FedEx
was authorized as an air carrier and UPS as a motor carrier, States
were preempted from regulating intrastate movements by FedEx but could
regulate the same movements by UPS.
In 1994 Congress closed that inadvertent regulatory loophole by
passing H.R. 2739, the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization
Act of 1994 (PL 103-305). While ostensibly legislation to reauthorize
aviation programs, it is best known as one of the final surface
transportation deregulation legislative acts. Section 601 of that act
amended 49 USC 14501 (then codified at 49 USC 11501) to create a new
subsection (h), which broadly preempted State regulation of prices,
routes and services (emphasis added) of intrastate movements of motor
carriers of property.
A complication arose to this effort. In H.R. 2739, Congress
intended to model the preemption provision it was enacting of State
motor carriers of property on the broad preemption of State regulation
of air carriers in 49 USC 41713, which as passed preempted State
regulation of air carrier rates, routes and services (emphasis added).
The rates, routes and services clause of section 41713 had been broadly
interpreted by Courts, including the Supreme Court. However, in
drafting section 601 of the FAA Authorization Act, the Committee
discovered that the critical language of section 41713 preemption,
rates, routes and services had been amended in a technical corrections
act by the Law Revision Council to a different (the current)
formulation, prices, routes and services. The Conference Report on H.R.
2735 clarified Congress' intent that the different language of the two
provisions had the same meaning and force of law.
2. ICC Termination Act of 1995
In the 1994 midterm elections, Republicans became the majority
party in both the House and Senate in the 104th Congress and a
legislative priority of the new majorities was the elimination of the
ICC. While eliminating federal agencies was a provision of the so-
called ``Contract for America,'' efforts to specifically eliminate the
ICC predated it. In the Democratic led 103rd Congress, there had been a
bipartisan effort among several members of the House (led by the
unusual bi-partisan coalition of Congressmen Frank, DeLay and Kasich)
to eliminate the ICC, but those efforts lacked leadership support.
Another consequence of the 1994 midterm election was a reorganization
of Committees in the House in the 104th Congress, where the Public
Works and Transportation Committee was renamed the Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure and was, as indicated above, given
jurisdiction over railroads from the Energy and Commerce Committee (as
well as Coast Guard and Merchant Marine from the Resources Committee).
Thus in 1995 this Committee began the bipartisan task of eliminating
the ICC, which involved revising the entire ICA and creating the STB.
In the yearlong process of drafting and passing the ICCTA, this
Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee very deliberately revised
and expanded the ICA preemption provision in 49 USC 10501(b) to be as
broad as possible, both because of their fundamental belief in the
importance of preemption of State regulation of interstate commerce,
and to avoid a repeat of the Committees' 1994 experience with the scope
and then-changed language of the aviation (and modeled thereafter
trucking) preemption provisions, which had just happened a few months
prior.
In pertinent part, section 10501(b)(1) as enacted reads:

(b) The jurisdiction of the Board over--
(1) transportation by rail carriers, and the remedies provided
in this part with respect to rates, classifications, rules
(including car service, interchange, and other operating
rules), practices, routes, services and the facilities of such
carriers . . .

* * *

is exclusive. Except as otherwise provided in this part, the
remedies provided under this part with respect to the
regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the
remedies provided under Federal or State law. (emphasis added)

As indicated above, section 10501 as enacted was purposely
broadened from prior preemption provisions both in reaction to the
issues raised in 1994 and to forestall any need to modify and clarify
the provision in the future. Notably for this hearing, the revised
section 10501 specifically preempted other remedies that could be
applicable to rail carriers under other federal laws and not just State
laws.
Over time, section 10501 has been recognized to be extremely broad,
and as a result applied using a rule of reason (since read literally it
would preempt every other law potentially even health and safety laws
such as building codes!). In my experience, the pertinent analysis is
for the STB or a reviewing Court to examine the intent and effect of
the other State or federal law, evaluate whether that law would be
subject to 10501 and determine whether the intent and effect of such
law or regulation is contrary to 10501. Importantly when the effect of
section 10501 is evaluated with respect to another federal law, the STB
and Courts evaluate the two laws to see if they are in conflict, and
before determining the other federal law is preempted, attempt to
harmonize the statutes (or regulation promulgated thereunder).
The CARB Regulations are Preempted by The Interstate Commerce Act
In my view, the CARB regulations are unequivocally preempted by
section 10501 of the ICA. I come to this conclusion when considering
the following:

The plain language of section 10501 and its clear and
unambiguous intent to prevent State regulation of rail carriers
operating in interstate commerce;

The fact that CARB has petitioned the EPA to open a Tier
5 locomotive standard proceeding, and while EPA chose not to open such
a proceeding, it is studying the issue;

The broad intent and scope of the CARB regulations and
that they explicitly apply to equipment entering California as part of
an interstate movement and not just equipment local to California;

The practical infeasibility of creating a California-only
locomotive fleet for movements in interstate commerce means the CARB
regulations' standards would become de facto national standards;

The attempt by CARB to influence equipment manufacture
through the CARB regulations' definition of in use;

The infeasibility of zero emissions technology in the
timeframes anticipated by the CARB regulations and the uncertainty
created by the two progress evaluations.

The economic impact of, and the penalty-like nature of
the spending account provisions proposed; and

The impossibility of small railroads' compliance with the
requirements.

Similarly, when examining the CARB petition to the EPA, I do not
see how the CARB regulations could take effect in a manner that would
not conflict with the plain wording and longstanding intent and
application of the ICA and as a result would be facially preempted. I
also believe that, were the EPA to grant the CARB petition under 209(e)
and delegate to California the ability to regulate locomotives in use
in California, the CARB regulations could not be harmonized with the
ICA and would be preempted.
Importantly, as a matter of statutory construction, section 10501
is the later enactment of federal law. The amendments to the Clean Air
Act cited by CARB as the underlying authority for their petition to EPA
predate the ICCTA. This means that when Congress passed the ICCTA and
its included preemption provision, Congress was aware of the cited
provisions of the Clean Air Act when it preempted ``remedies provided
under federal . . . law'' 49 USC 10501.
The EPA is the Proper Agency to Set Locomotive Emissions Standards for
a National System
While I understand that many Members of the Committee may believe
that locomotive emissions can and should be further curtailed,
particularly in California, there are effective and importantly, non-
preempted ways for the EPA and CARB to do so--EPA can open a Tier 5
locomotive rulemaking and CARB can continue its efforts to reach
voluntary agreements with freight railroads operating in California.
First, EPA is the proper agency to set locomotive standards at a
national level consistent with the needs of an interoperable national
system. Even with the preemption provisions of the ICA, the EPA has had
the ability to set national locomotive emissions standards and has
undertaken a number of rulemakings in the past to do so. The most
current emissions standards, Tier 4, were set by the EPA. As has been
indicated many times in comments to EPA in their proceeding on CARB's
request, CARB did petition the EPA to open a Tier 5 proceeding to set
new standards and while EPA has not opened such a proceeding, it still
has the ability to do so. While such a proceeding may take time, the
fact that it would be time consuming to consider national implications
of its standard setting illustrates the complex and evolving nature of
locomotive manufacture and technological limits.
Second, CARB could return to a cooperative posture with the freight
rail industry and make real improvements in air quality for its
citizens through voluntary agreements, which have been highly effective
in reducing locomotive emissions in California. In the past, California
State and local air quality agencies had accepted that they did not
have the legal authority to set locomotive emissions standards and
sought to work cooperatively with railroads. When a local California
air quality agency, the South Coast Air Quality Management District
(SCAQMD), did adopt locomotive idling restrictions some years ago they
were ruled to be preempted. CARB negotiated voluntary locomotive fleet
agreements with the major western freight railroads, Union Pacific and
BNSF Railway, which produced real local benefits to California
residents and at the same time allowed the freight railroads to
effectively operate national networks. Emissions in California have
improved significantly as a result of those agreements and could again.
Regulatory Process Concerns With CARB Proposal
In addition to the substantive concerns raised above regarding the
conflict of the CARB regulations with the ICA, I would also highlight
several reasons why I am concerned about this situation as a matter of
regulatory policy.
First, the CARB regulations are technology forcing, as they require
railroads to adopt technology that does not yet commercially exist, by
a future date certain with the aim of spurring technology innovation
and adoption. While it may be well-meaning, as a general matter
adopting technology forcing regulation raises the question of whether
an agency is improperly requiring the adoption of equipment which is
neither technologically nor economically feasible. CARB tries to
preemptively address this reality by including periodic, future
``progress reviews'' to evaluate the state of zero emissions
technology. Looked at another way, CARB effectively acknowledges the
current infeasibility of the equipment it is requiring. Yet this kind
of process--legally requiring the deployment of technology that is not
yet available and providing for a discretionary waiver of that
requirement if meeting the requirement by the adoption date become
infeasible--is the wrong way to encourage the adoption of new
technology. Rather than focusing on realistic and tangible
improvements, this type of regulation encourages strong opposition and
in my opinion is a deterrent to the adoption of new technology.
Second, CARB is, obviously, a California State agency, and in
adopting regulations CARB is only required to evaluate effects in the
State of California, even when, as here, the clear impact of its action
is nationwide. EPA, by contrast, is a national regulatory agency and
must consider the nationwide effects of its actions and evaluate and
respond to all comments. Considering the full effects of regulatory
actions is the proper way to regulate national industries.
Finally, if adopted and enforced, the CARB regulations would likely
increase emissions and pollutants in other jurisdictions by diverting
cargo to other locations and through mode shift to trucks. Neither is
in the national interest but could in theory meet California's desired
goals. National policymakers should not let California regulators take
steps to reduce emissions in California by increasing them elsewhere
without consideration of those effects.
Conclusion
For the reasons I have discussed in this testimony, I believe the
CARB regulations and CARB proposal are preempted by section 10501 of
the ICA. While recognizing that decreasing emissions from locomotives
is a laudable goal, I ask the Committee to remember that there are
better and more effective ways to do so than improperly delegating the
ability to regulate locomotive emissions standards to one state.
I look forward to answering any questions you might have.

and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to
testify on this important topic. My name is Ural Yal. I am a
senior vice president at Flatiron Construction and a vice
president of the highway and transportation division at AGC,
Associated General Contractors of California.
With nearly 900 members specializing in all facets of
construction, at AGC of California, we believe the construction
industry is vital to the success of California, and we are
passionate about shaping policy, improving our State's
infrastructure, and developing our workforce.
My firm, Flatiron Construction, is a national
infrastructure contractor founded in Colorado in 1947, and we
have been operating in California since 1989.
With more than 3,500 craft and professional employees--
1,100 of those are in California--we work for public and
private clients to deliver essential infrastructure. Our yearly
revenues exceed $2\1/2\ billion, and more than $1 billion is
generated in California.
We have worked with passenger and freight rail operators
throughout our history with notable projects such as a 68-mile
segment of California high-speed rail, Redlands Passenger Rail
Project in San Bernardino County, North Coast Corridor Program
in San Diego that serves joint Amtrak and BNSF lines,
intermodal facility improvements, rail operation and safety
improvements such as grade separations and double-tracking on
passenger and freight rail lines across California and several
other States.
As a contractor that self-performs the majority of our work
with our own craft workforce, and with rail and transit
construction being a major part of our business, maintaining
investments in infrastructure spending is very important to us.
A more environmentally friendly Nation starts with our
State and Federal agency partners' ability to build while
maintaining jobs, ensuring stable material pricing, meeting
effective transportation needs, and securing the funding
required to build the projects our communities need.
The construction industry not only creates jobs, but also
drives economic growth by developing the infrastructure
necessary for a sustainable future.
While AGC of California supports the goal of a more
environmentally friendly State, the California Air Resources
Board in-use locomotive regulation, if granted, will have
significant adverse effects on infrastructure development,
construction supply chain, and job creation.
One reason for this adverse effect is available funding.
The proposed spending account and useful life requirements
within CARB's in-use locomotive regulation present significant
financial and operational challenges for our agency partners
and operators.
These requirements are designed to accelerate the
transition to zero-emission locomotives by mandating
substantial financial contributions from operators into a
spending account, and limiting the operational life of existing
locomotives.
While we support the intent to reduce emissions, these
measures impose undue burdens on our transportation agencies,
and by extension, the communities they serve.
We are concerned that this regulation will have unintended
consequences and jeopardize planned infrastructure projects and
construction jobs.
Another aspect of this regulation is the potential impacts
on construction costs. The costs of construction have gone up,
including the cost of construction materials, construction
labor, and transportation of materials.
Since February 2020, the average cost of construction
materials has increased by 39 percent, a rate that is nearly
twice as high as the rate of consumer inflation, with notable
increases of over 60 percent or more in diesel and steel mill
products.
The CARB in-use locomotive regulation would further
increase these costs and the costs to rebuild the Nation's
infrastructure, further diminishing what can be built with
available funding.
The majority of AGC of California members rely on sustained
infrastructure funding to keep and develop our workforce and
sustain our businesses.
Given the already strained funding and infrastructure due
to supply chain and inflationary pressures, resulting in the
recent downscaling of projects due to lack of funding, CARB's
in-use locomotive regulation will result in further impacts to
our industry.
Thank you for allowing me to testify today, and I am happy
to answer any questions you may have.

Prepared Statement of Ural Yal, Senior Vice President--Corporate
Preconstruction Group, Flatiron Construction, on behalf of the
Associated General Contractors of California
Introduction
Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Wilson, and members of the
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials, thank
you for inviting me to testify on this vitally important topic. My name
is Ural Yal, Senior Vice President of the Corporate Preconstruction
Group at Flatiron Construction, and an active member of the Associated
General Contractors (AGC) of California. I currently sit on the
Executive Committee at AGC as the Vice President of Highway &
Transportation. Since 1920, AGC of California has been a member driven
organization (501c6) with around 900 members specializing in commercial
construction. We believe the construction industry is vital to the
success of California. Together, our members actively create
opportunities to build and strengthen our state. We are passionate
about shaping policy, improving industry relationships, and developing
our workforce.
AGC members are the contractors that built California's current
infrastructure. They are also the contractors maintaining our existing
infrastructure and building the next generation for the state. This
includes passenger rail systems, freight rail, affordable, and mixed
income housing developments, air and seaports, roads, bridges, transit
systems, and more.
Flatiron is a leading infrastructure contractor with operations
across the United States and Canada. We were in founded in Colorado in
1947 and have been operating in California since 1989. With more than
3,500 craft and professional employees--1,100 of those employees are in
California--we collaborate with public and private clients to deliver
essential infrastructure. Our revenues exceed $2.5b, of which more than
$1B is generated in California. We are ranked top 10 by Engineering
News-Record in transportation and heavy civil construction in the US.
Our focus market segments are rail and transit systems, aviation,
highways, bridges, water and wastewater treatment facilities,
resiliency and flood protection, dams and reservoirs, and sustainable
mobility. With a focus on safety and quality, Flatiron builds long-
term, collaborative relationships with clients, construction partners
and communities. Our skilled craft employees and on-site leaders bring
vital expertise and experience to each project. Our industry-leading
engineers create innovative solutions to complex issues. And, beyond
delivering essential infrastructure projects, Flatiron people
demonstrate a commitment to sustainability, to our clients and the
communities where we live and work.
We have worked with passenger and freight rail operators throughout
our history, with notable projects such as a 68-mile segment of
California High-Speed Rail, Redlands Passenger Rail in San Bernardino
County in California, North Coast Corridor program in San Diego that
serves joint Amtrak and BNSF lines, intermodal facility improvements
for BNSF, numerous safety improvements such as grade separations and
double tracking on passenger and freight rail lines across California
and several other states.
As a contractor that self-performs majority of our work with our
own craft workforce and with rail and transit construction being a
major part of our business, maintaining investments in infrastructure
spending in this field very important to us.
The construction industry is vital to our nation's economy,
providing the foundation upon which our communities are built and
thrive. A more environmentally friendly nation starts with our state
and federal agency partners' ability to build it while maintaining the
jobs our communities need, ensuring stable material pricing, meeting
effective transportation needs, and securing the funding required to
support the communities our agency partners develop and build for. The
construction industry not only creates jobs but also drives economic
growth by developing the infrastructure necessary for a sustainable
future.
While AGC of California supports the goal of a more environmentally
friendly state, the California Air Resources Board's (CARB) In Use
Locomotive Regulation, if granted, will have significant adverse
effects on infrastructure development, the construction supply chain,
and job creation.
CARB's regulation would require railroads, beginning in 2030, from
operating locomotives in California that are more than 23 years beyond
their original manufacture date. In addition, beginning in 2030 for
industrial, switch, and passenger locomotives and 2035 for line-haul
locomotives, newly purchased locomotives operated in California would
need to be zero-emission. The railroads have made significant
investments in developing battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell
locomotives, however commercially viable zero-emission locomotives are
unavailable.
California has a total of twelve ports and about forty percent of
container freight moves through California ports.\1\ According to Union
Pacific, 52% of rail traffic is bulk commodities for things like
agriculture and energy products, construction materials, chemicals,
equipment, metals, minerals, among other things.\2\ And according to
the Association of American Railroads, rail accounts 40 percent of
long-distance freight by ton-mile.\3\ The ability to transport
construction materials and other freight by rail is vital to the
economy of California and the nation and would be hindered by the CARB
regulation.

Construction Costs have Increased
The costs of construction have gone up, including the cost of
construction materials, construction labor, and transport of materials.
The CARB In Use Locomotive Regulation would further increase these
costs and the cost to rebuild the nation's infrastructure.
Construction Material Prices
At Flatiron Construction, and more broadly within the construction
industry, managing inflation defined 2023 and a lot of 2024. Since
February 2020, the average cost of construction materials has increased
by 39%; nearly twice as high as the rate of consumer inflation, which
was 21% during that same period (See Appendix Table 1). More
specifically, some construction markets, like highway construction,
have seen an increase of 68% since December 2020, according to the
Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) National Highway Construction
Cost Index (NHCCI).\4\ These figures also reflect significant cost
increases for specific construction materials from February 2020 to May
2024 (See Appendix Table 2), which include a:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ National Highway Construction Cost Index, Q4 2020 to Q4 2023
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

63% increase in the price of diesel;

60% increase in the price of steel mill products;

49% increase in the price of gypsum (used in a lot of
building materials); and

38% increase in the price of cement.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ Bureau of Labor Statistics, Producer Price Indexes

The price of fuel, especially diesel, has driven up costs for the
construction industry and project costs nationwide. Higher diesel costs
mean construction companies must pay more to operate equipment, deliver
materials to jobsites, and haul away dirt, debris, and equipment.
Likewise, construction workers themselves feel the pain of higher
commuting costs--particularly for jobs in rural areas where workers
often have long commutes.
Construction Labor Costs
The Bureau of Labor Statistics released numbers in April 2024 that
showed that there were still 338,000 job openings in construction
despite 353,000 new hires reported throughout the month. In other
words, the industry cannot find enough people to hire. This has
resulted in dramatic increases in labor costs. The average hourly
earnings in construction increased 20% from $29.64 an hour in December
2020 to $35.45 an hour in May 2024. This increase, outpacing growth in
the private sector.\6\

Transporting Construction Materials
Construction material prices have increased and as a result of the
increased cost of diesel, so have the costs to transport them. The CARB
regulation would only exacerbate the problem.
While railroads account for a smaller portion of freight movement
by weight and value, it is significant because these shipments reduce
what would otherwise be increased congestion on our roadways. In
addition, according to the Association of American Railroads, on
average railroads are three to four times more fuel efficient than
trucks.\7\ Railroads account for about 0.5% of total U.S. greenhouse
gas emissions and just 1.7% of greenhouse gas emissions in the
transportation sector.\8\

CARB Regulation will Jeopardize Planned Infrastructure Projects
The proposed Spending Account and Useful-Life Requirement within
CARB's In-Use Locomotive Regulation present significant financial and
operational challenges for our agency partners. These requirements are
designed to accelerate the transition to zero-emission locomotives by
mandating substantial financial contributions from operators into a
spending account and limiting the operational life of existing
locomotives. While the intent to reduce emissions is commendable, these
measures impose undue burdens on our transportation agencies and, by
extension, the communities they serve. We are concerned that this
regulation will have unintended consequences and jeopardize planned
infrastructure projects and construction jobs.
Barstow International Gateway Project
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) Railway's Barstow
International Gateway is a transformative infrastructure project
designed to enhance the efficiency and capacity of freight rail
operations in California. This state-of-the-art, master-planned rail
facility represents an investment of over $1.5 billion and spans
approximately 4,500 acres on the west side of Barstow. The facility
will include a rail yard, an intermodal facility, and warehouses for
transloading freight from international containers to domestic
containers. The facility is designed to improve cargo velocity and
reduce congestion both at the ports and on the highways. By allowing
for the direct transfer of containers from ships at the Ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach to trains, the project will help reduce truck
traffic and freeway congestion in the Los Angeles Basin and the Inland
Empire. The use of clean-energy powered cargo-handling equipment at the
facility will also contribute to improving the region's air quality.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ BNSF Railway, BNSF to Build New Integrated Rail Complex in

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Spending Account (Section 2478.4(a)-(e)) mandates that
locomotive operators deposit significant sums annually based on the
tier of their locomotives. Katie Farmer, CEO of BNSF spoke at the North
American Rail Shippers Conference and said, ``We estimate that that
payment for us, and I know that it would be similar for the Union
Pacific, would be around $800 million a year.'' \10\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Furthermore, in a comment made by California's Office of Business
and Economic Development on the BNSF Barstow Project, ``The
significance of BNSF's investment to improve the supply chain here in
California cannot be overstated. Rail plays a critical role in moving
goods safely and efficiently, while reducing emissions due to
congestion in many of our high-traffic corridors,'' said Trelynd
Bradley, Deputy Director of Sustainable Freight and Supply Chain
Development at the Governor's Office of Business and Economic
Development. He added, ``Projects like BNSF's will work to strengthen
our inland local economies, such as that of Barstow in San Bernardino
County. We look forward to continuing to work with projects like these,
as well as others, to drive transformative investments that will
enhance and elevate California's supply chain ecosystem for a more
efficient and resilient tomorrow.'' \12\

California clearly and publicly supports infrastructure development
that improves upon the movement of goods specifically referring to BNSF

stated the positive impact ``Rail plays a critical role in moving goods
safely and efficiently, while reducing emissions due to congestion in
many of our high-traffic corridors'' again, stated by California's
Office of Business and Economic Development. However, the CARB
regulation works to dismantle such efforts.
The Barstow Project would Create Jobs and have Positive Economic
Impacts
The Barstow International Gateway is poised to create significant
economic benefits for the region and beyond. The project is expected to
generate approximately 20,000 direct and indirect jobs, a substantial
boost to the local economy of Barstow, where the population is around
25,231. The jobs impacted by this regulation would span beyond my
company and the construction industry and also jeopardize jobs in
operations, and ancillary services, providing much-needed employment
opportunities in the high desert region. Those jobs and many others are
threatened by CARB's In-Use Locomotive Regulation.
The CARB Regulation would Contradict State Priorities
Furthermore, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (LA Metro), Ventura County Transportation Commission (VCTC),
San Bernardino County Transportation Authority (SBCTA), National
Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), Orange County Transportation
Authority (OCTA) Southern California Regional Rail Authority
(Metrolink) and Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board (Caltrain)
accounting for the majority of passenger rail in California have
expressed the severe financial burden that would be a result of such
accounts. According to CalTrain ``This would mean encumbering tens of
millions of dollars into a Spending Account that would be unavailable
for rail operations, state of good repair improvements, or leveraging
federal investment in rolling stock and capital projects, despite
existing plans to replace 75 percent of our fleet with ZEV EMUs.
Caltrain does not have flexible funds that could account for this level
of financial disruption and would be forced to impact operating
budgets, reduce service, or in the worst case, shut down entirely. This
requirement in creating a new financial liability could impact the
agency's credit rating, which would be problematic for the financing
that may be needed simply to comply with the regulation and continue to
run service. There is no funding attached to this regulation and thus,
passenger rail agencies will have no assistance or recourse to
comply.'' \13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\ California Air Resource Board, Caltrain letter
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The world is anticipating the LA28 Olympic Games which officials
have advertised as `car-free' games.\14\ This regulation itself
contradicts the State of California's goals to reduce Vehicle Miles
Traveled (VMT) if our agency partners ability to utilize funds for
maintenance, operations, and expansion of rail prior to the Olympics is
significantly reduced. While the goals of the Spending Account and
Useful-Life Requirement within CARB's In-Use Locomotive Regulation are
aimed at promoting environmental sustainability, the adverse effects on
agency partners are substantial.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
In conclusion, while the goals of CARB's In-Use Locomotive
Regulation to reduce emissions and promote environmental sustainability
are commendable, the proposed Spending Account and Useful-Life
Requirements present significant challenges that cannot be overlooked.
These measures impose undue financial and operational burdens on our
transportation agencies, complicating compliance with existing federal
standards and diverting critical funds from essential infrastructure
projects.
While construction materials are shipped by virtually every mode of
transportation, constraining the rail industry's ability to operate in
the state of California could have ripple effects across the country.
In addition, AGC is concerned about other states following suit and
mandating zero emission locomotives like how they followed California's
vehicle emission standards.\15\

The construction industry, which is pivotal to rebuilding our
nation's infrastructure, stands to be severely impacted. The burden and
uncertainty of the CARB regulation could disrupt supply chains, delay
construction projects, and jeopardize construction jobs. This, in turn,
undermines the ability of the construction industry and its agency
partners to build and maintain the infrastructure that supports our
communities.
I thank the Committee for the opportunity to testify today and look
forward to answering any questions that members may have.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mr. Yal.
Ms. Arias, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HEATHER ARIAS, CHIEF, TRANSPORTATION AND TOXICS
DIVISION, CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD

Ms. Arias. Good afternoon and thank you for having me
today. Chair Randolph asked that I pass along her apologies for
not being able to attend.
I am Heather Arias, the Transportation and Toxics Division
chief. My team is the team that developed the locomotive rule
that we are discussing today.
I also have teams who have developed and are implementing
regulations for engines all across California's transportation
system, but today, we are focused on the locomotive regulation.
Locomotives are one of the largest sources of criteria
pollutants in California. Ninety percent of California
railroads are within 1 mile of vulnerable residential
communities already highly impacted by nitrogen oxide, or NOx,
and toxic diesel particulate matter, of which there is no known
safe level of exposure.
Reduction of the pollution caused by locomotives operating
in the State is critical for California to meet its Clean Air
Act obligations. Locomotives represent 31 percent of the NOx
reductions needed in California's State Implementation Plan
Strategy to meet attainment under the Clean Air Act for highly
polluted air basins such as South Coast and San Joaquin.
Locomotives are not entitled to a free pass, and like other
regulated industries, railroads operating in California must
reduce emissions that are harming Californians.
Railroad operations in California continue to use, and are
increasing use of, some of the oldest and most polluting
engines in California.
Although Tier 4 engines have been available since 2015,
railroads have continued to operate locomotives in California
with emission control technologies over 20 years old,
technologies that produce over 80 percent more emissions than
the current U.S. EPA Tier 4 emission standard.
Even worse, railroads continue to operate locomotives in
California that are up to 50 years old with no emission
controls at all, and in the past several years, the average
emissions of their locomotive fleets operating in California
have gotten worse--not better.
California has been taking robust steps, pursuant to the
Clean Air Act, to reduce emissions from other mobile sources,
including heavy-duty trucks, passenger cars, off-road
equipment, ships docked in California's ports, and more.
Locomotives are increasingly the outlier. Today, when comparing
the transportation of the same number of shipping containers,
locomotives produce more NOx and toxic diesel particulate
matter than trucks operating in the State, and soon,
locomotives will produce more greenhouse gas emissions than
trucks on a per-shipping-container basis.
In 2023, the California Air Resources Board, or CARB,
adopted a locomotive regulation that is estimated to result in
$32 billion in health savings to Californians by preventing
3,200 premature deaths and 1,500 emergency room visits and
hospitalizations. The reg would also decrease cancer risk from
exposure to locomotive emissions by up to 90 percent.
CARB's locomotive regulation follows California's expressly
preserved authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate
emissions from locomotives operating in the State. It does not
set emission standards on new locomotives, nor does it mandate
the purchase or use of zero-emission locomotives.
Operators may continue to operate Tier 4 locomotives for
decades to come, and because nearly every locomotive operating
today runs on fully electric motors and can be powered using a
fuel source other than its diesel generators, operators may
continue using their existing locomotives by configuring them
to run on zero-emission power sources.
The regulation allows ample time for emission-control
technologies to continue to advance and for market efficiencies
to put downward pressure on prices.
It is important to note that zero-emission rail
transportation is nothing new. Electrified rail is more than
100 years old, and we once had electrified tracks throughout
the Nation, coast to coast.
Advances in battery and hydrogen fuel technology have given
railroads more options than 100 years ago. It is saddening and
disappointing that railroads remain some of the top polluters
in the State given all the tools available to them to do
better.
California's passenger vehicles, heavy-duty trucks,
oceangoing vessels, and heavy off-road equipment, among other
emission sectors, are all doing their part. All we ask is that
the railroads do their part, too, so Californians can have
clean air to breathe. Thank you.

Conclusion
California's passenger vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, ocean-going
vessels, and heavy off-road equipment, among other emissions sectors,
are all doing their part. It is past time that the railroads did their
part to clean up the air we breathe.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you all for your testimony. We will now
turn to questions for the panel. I recognize myself for 5
minutes.
Mr. Olvera, according to CARB's own analysis, short line
and regional railroads won't be able to comply with the cost of
the regulation and would cease to operate. I think short lines
operate on routes that Class I's, pretty much they abandoned
them, right? They abandoned them.
So, did CARB consider the unique business structure of
short lines?
Mr. Olvera. So, many short lines in the State of California
have very small operations. They operate on very thin margins
and don't have the financial wherewithal to invest in Tier 4,
and ultimately zero-emission locomotives, even with State and
Federal funding.
Our railroad consists of 11 locomotives, 9 of which we
proactively signed up for clean air locomotives back in 2008,
invested millions of dollars, along with the State of
California.
But now, well before the useful lives of those locomotives
are over, we are being asked to scrap them and upgrade to more
expensive Tier 4 locomotives and put money into a spending
account in the tune of about $1 million annually.
Those types of financial requirements really don't fit the
financial model of my short line or any others.
Mr. Nehls. Very well. Thank you.
Mr. Nober, is it more accurate to describe this proposed
rule as one that regulates new locomotive engines and emission
controls, and not just the use of locomotives?
Mr. Nober. I think the regulation as technically written
really apply--it says it only applies to in-use, but I think
that that is a--it is twisting the definition a little bit of
``in-use'' because you can't use anything that hasn't been
manufactured.
Mr. Nehls. Sure.
Mr. Nober. So, I would say that the clear goal is to incent
and to create and to force manufacturers to be able to produce
locomotives that can meet these emissions standards, or become
zero-emissions standards.
Mr. Nehls. Sure, yes.
Mr. Nober. So, it is, as a practical matter, regulating
manufacturer.
Mr. Nehls. Sure. On the question of locomotive use, the
Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act and the various
Surface Transportation Board decisions and court rulings have
found that State in other attempts to regulate railroad
operations are preempted by Federal law.
And as former Chairman of the STB, should EPA follow the
STB's recommendations and conduct its preemptive analysis and
consider interpreting and applying CAA narrowly so as to avoid
conflict with the ICCTA?
Mr. Nober. I mean, clearly in the first blush, and I don't
think it is 100 percent clear, whether the STB alone in a
court, or the STB and the EPA alone could apply harmonization
analysis.
But the EPA certainly has the ability to look at the two
statutes and decide whether one is in conflict with another,
and we certainly would--I would, if they asked me, I would
advocate that they do that.
Mr. Nehls. Sure. Finally, in pursuing the regulation of
locomotives via a waiver, EPA avoids statutes like the
Congressional Review Act or the empaneling a small business
advocacy panel under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement
Fairness Act.
Shouldn't a proposal of this consequence, at a minimum, be
conducted as an Administrative Procedure Act rule so the CRA
and the SBREFA apply?
Mr. Nober. Well, as now a scholar of regulatory process, I
strongly believe that significant actions like this should be
done under the most Administrative Procedure Act process,
which, in this case, would be to either do a full rulemaking,
which would have notice and comment.
Now, they did open a proceeding, and people did comment,
including many folks who are in the audience and myself, but
the legal obligation to consider those comments and then to,
again, have it be subject to the Congressional Review Act and
cost-benefit analysis and many of the other portions of it,
would be different if it were a full rulemaking.
So, the more that it is a rulemaking, the more process
there is and the stronger outcome it will be.
Mr. Nehls. Very well.
And, Mr. Yal, California AGC is a member of the Rebuild
SoCal Partnership, which represents 2,750 contractors and over
90,000 union workers. This group wrote in opposition to the
CARB rule for many of the reasons you stated in your testimony,
sir.
Would it be fair to say that the CARB rule jeopardizes the
Barstow Gateway Project in San Bernardino County?
Mr. Yal. Yes, that is correct. That is a very large project
that is planned by BNSF in that area. It is a big economic
engine. It is one of the biggest mega projects in the area, and
it is jeopardized by this.
Mr. Nehls. Yes. And that is not what we should be doing
here.
I want to thank you all. I yield back the balance.
I now recognize Ranking Member Wilson for 5 minutes.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Ms. Arias, communities living near railroads and rail
lines, which are most often historically underserved
communities, are routinely exposed to high levels of air
pollution and emissions stemming from the burning of diesel
fuels.
In just your State, CARB estimates that reducing locomotive
emissions would prevent 3,200 premature deaths and save $32
billion in healthcare costs.
What are the steps that railroads could immediately make to
reduce emissions in these communities?
Ms. Arias. Thank you, ma'am. Yes, we are currently working
with the rail lines. In fact, I want to actually applaud the
Class III lines because they are taking immediate steps by, as
mentioned earlier, applying for funds.
They are coming forward. There are 200 Class III engines in
our State. Thirty of those engines are currently under
applications for State or Federal funds. So, that is a great
step to make progress immediately.
There are other things that could be done as far as
maximizing use of the newer engines. There are things like
ensuring that the engines idle the least amount as possible.
There are things like working to utilize cleaner technology in
the other equipment that is at the railroads. So, there are
things that can be done now.
We have also ensured that there are different pathways in
the regs so that if any one of the industries have a different
idea that may actually incentivize cleaner technologies sooner,
they can come to us and work with us on an alternative
compliance plan and get credit earlier, which allows for other
opportunities later.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Can you tell us, or synthesize for
us, how important it is to reduce emissions from locomotives?
Ms. Arias. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. As far as locomotives are
concerned in California, the Clean Air Act, as I mentioned
earlier, does have requirements for attainment across the
State. The locomotives are one-third of our emissions necessary
to meet that final--sorry--Federal requirement.
Outside of that, our State has also identified diesel as a
toxics air contaminant in the late 1990s. The diesel engines
that are running throughout the State are contaminating the
nearby neighborhoods.
If this rule were to go into place, we would see a 90-
percent reduction from the current diesel exposure to those
communities.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you. Diesel emissions are
known to create higher health risks, childhood asthma, and
cancer. Tier 4 locomotives have 90 percent lower particulate
matter emissions and 80 percent lower nitrogen oxide emissions
than a Tier 2 locomotive. How many Tier 4 locomotives do Class
I railroads operate?
Ms. Arias. Great question, ma'am. We only have data from UP
and BNSF regarding locomotives that come into the South Coast
air basin. We do not know what their total national fleet is.
They have mentioned that they have a lot of Tier 4s. They
have said many of them are parked. We have asked multiple times
how many they have, and we do not have that data.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Well, can you tell us if railroads
will be in compliance with this regulation if they operate Tier
4 locomotives or remanufacture existing locomotives to Tier 4
standards?
Ms. Arias. If they operated Tier 4 locomotives, they would
certainly make a huge dent in their requirement. Ultimately,
over many decades, the goal is to transition to zero-emission
operations.
What could be done even today is a reconfiguration of their
existing engines, so they wouldn't necessarily have to change
the engine to a Tier 4. So, for example, if they are operating
a Tier 1 or Tier 2, some of the much older engines that we
discussed, they could reconfigure that engine, because the
locomotive you see that is going down the line is actually all
electric.
There is a smaller diesel generator on that train that is
providing the power. They can reconfigure that to allow for
zero-emission operation. There are tender cars or catenary that
can do that. That can make that engine a hybrid engine, similar
to what you have seen in cars for many, many years.
That hybrid engine could operate in zero-emission
operations in our State, and even in other communities to
remove or eliminate the diesel health exposure issue. That can
happen today. Those technologies are available today. They are
for sale today.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Wow, thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentlelady yields.
I now recognize Mr. Rouzer for 5 minutes.
Mr. Rouzer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Nober, the California Air Resources Board claims
railroads should do their part when it comes to emissions
reductions, which sounds like a pretty subjective mission
statement to me.
Your testimony points out that if such regulations are
necessary, then EPA should open a proceeding. Can you talk
about why that is important, and what the fundamental
difference is between agency rulemaking and the waiver process?
Mr. Nober. Well, a waiver process is, strictly speaking,
what is called an adjudication. So, it is CARB coming in and
asking for the agency to take an action with respect to that
request.
So, CARB is standing as if there were any other applicant
for something, and parties go to agencies and ask for waivers
of rules all the time.
A notice-and-comment rulemaking is doing a rule of general
applicability, and that is one that is published in the Federal
Register--now this was, too--you open a docket, the agency has
an obligation to put out a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
They then have to take comments. They have to respond to
every comment. The rule has to then, since it is EPA, it would
have--if it is a major rule, would have to go to OMB. It would
have to have a cost-benefit analysis, and most importantly, I
think a rule would be able to evaluate national impacts.
So, the issue that I would have as a matter of practice
here, is that CARB, as a California State agency, its legal
obligation--and I may be wrong, Ms. Arias may correct me here,
but is to look at impacts in the State of California.
And EPA--let's say that the effect of this was to create
mode shift so that ships would go farther and go to Houston or
Savannah, and that more is going on truck, and that more cargo
that is now going by rail through southern California is going
in other places, that might increase diesel emissions to people
in other parts of the country--EPA in a rulemaking would have
to look at that. And in a waiver proceeding, those kinds of
questions would be discretionary. It wouldn't automatically
have to look at them.
Mr. Rouzer. So, it is a much more thorough process?
Mr. Nober. Absolutely. And it certainly can be more time-
consuming than a waiver process, without a doubt. And probably
most stakeholders would be frustrated with the amount of time
that most agencies took to do rules, but there is a plus and a
minus to that.
Now, a Tier 5, a new national locomotive standard would
probably take a significant amount of time longer because they
would have to study different technologies, different
feasibilities, and make a national assessment on overall, you
know, the ability to roll them out, and locomotives are
difficult--I have seen--one of the reasons probably there
aren't that many Tier 4 locomotives is that they performed
poorly in the beginning when they first came out.
Only one manufacturer has ever been able to even produce
Tier 4 locomotives. There are two locomotive manufacturers, and
one of them was never able to produce a Tier 4 locomotive. And
the ones that have performed very poorly for many years, and
so, those become disincentives, I think, to carriers perhaps
investing more in them.
Mr. Rouzer. All right.
Mr. Yal, I am moving on slightly. What kind of supply chain
disruptions is this going to cause, and what about the effect
on inflation, how is this going to affect shippers?
Mr. Yal. A lot of construction materials certainly come
through rail, and any disruption into rail transportation
traffic is going to impact our supply chain, both on the length
of the projects because of delay times in getting the
materials, as well as the cost of the materials due to the
increased cost in transportation.
What happens if there are disruptions in rail traffic is
that starts to shift towards truck traffic, which then has also
impacts on costs, the timeliness, and honestly, there is a lot
of shortage in the trucking industry currently already that we
are experiencing that is just going to overload the system and
cause more impacts to us.
Mr. Rouzer. Thank you.
Ms. Arias, I can't help but ask this question. I was in
California a couple years ago, and the smoke from the forest
fires, I mean, you could hardly see from one end to the other.
Not a very pleasant environment to be in.
I understand more than 1 million acres of forest in
California have burned in recent years. Is this a focus of your
agency at all?
It just seems to me like you got a lot of carbon hitting
the atmosphere, and if there were a few preventive measures
that were put in place, you could prevent a lot of those forest
fires from happening.
I think if you looked at all the carbon from forest fires
versus everything else, it wouldn't even be close.
Any thought to that or any studies or any work on that
front?
Ms. Arias. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question. As a
matter of fact, absolutely, the State is looking at all of the
emissions, including forest fires. It has been such an
important issue that our legislators have also been very
involved and lots of different actions have been passed.
We are happy to follow up with you, if that would be
helpful, to provide a list of actions that the State has done,
but absolutely, a very critical reduction strategy as all of
this is. We have to make sure that we get reductions across the
board.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Chairman, my time is expired.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields.
I now recognize Mr. Moulton for 5 minutes.
Mr. Moulton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Olvera, I once worked for a smaller railroad than
yours. Now, I wasn't running the books. I was running engines
and on a track crew, so, I can't speak exactly to the numbers,
but it seemed like the railway was barely scraping by, with of
course hardly any help from the Government in stark contrast to
the trucking industry, which runs on roads and highways
entirely subsidized by the American taxpayer.
Now, you said that your railroad buys used locomotives,
most of which don't meet these standards. What effect would
buying brandnew Tier 4 or zero-emission locomotives have on
your business?
Mr. Olvera. Sure. New Tier 4 locomotives cost millions of
dollars apiece. Most short lines operate on locomotives that
cost a few hundred thousand dollars apiece.
My railroad actually purchased Tier 3 locomotives that were
about $1\1/2\ million apiece back in 2008 and have an extensive
amount of useful life left.
To be forced in a very abrupt timeline to scrap those Tier
3s and move to Tier 4s, with Federal and/or State funding,
would require about $1 million from our railroad for each
locomotive.
And with that, if we were able to comply, other safety-type
projects, such as track enhancement and crossing enhancement,
would have to be deferred in order to meet that standard. It
would be very difficult to comply with.
Mr. Moulton. I am actually amazed your railroad would still
be able to stay in business because there are a lot of
railroads that simply wouldn't be in business if that were the
case.
You noted in your testimony that California's short lines
move about 260,000 carloads of freight annually. Each carload
carries the equivalent of three to four trucks' worth of goods.
So, this means that short lines in California alone keep
about 1 million trucks annually off the highway. Is that right?
Is that the right number?
Mr. Olvera. Yes, that is correct. So, 1 rail carload
typically equates to 3 or 4 truck carloads, and so, 260,000
times 3 to 4 would be that number, north of 1 million.
A lot of the short lines, just on an individual basis in
the State of California, move thousands of carloads. My
railroad moves 35,000 carloads annually. If those carloads were
to be switched on truck and on our roads, that would result in
about 120,000 trucks annually on the roads versus on rail.
Mr. Moulton. And will that increase emissions?
Mr. Olvera. Absolutely. Through congestion--traffic
congestion and current gas house emission percentages, trucks
today emit 23 percent of greenhouse gas emissions while
railroads emit in total, 2 percent. And short lines actually
are a small fraction of the 2 percent, so, emissions would
immediately be impacted.
Mr. Moulton. The CARB report actually predicts the fall of
the short line industry because of the prohibitive costs of the
proposed regulation, noting it is possible some of these
businesses would be eliminated.
Cost burdens, from the rule, on small business operators
could range from 42 percent to 208 percent of their annual
revenues.
You can't run a business when your costs go up 208 percent
of your annual revenues.
Ms. Arias, Europe is well ahead of the United States on
climate policy as I am sure you well know, and their
transportation policy is focused on mode shift. What does
``mode shift'' mean in this context?
Ms. Arias. Yes, we are not interested in shifting the
freight from rail to trucks. We absolutely understand the
necessity to have both modes in our State. We do have the
largest ports in the Nation. We are also a huge producer of
agricultural products for the Nation. We must have all modes of
freight to be able to move all of that and----
Mr. Moulton [interrupting]. OK. But if you care about
emissions----
Ms. Arias [interposing]. Yes, sir.
Mr. Moulton [continuing]. As Europe does----
Ms. Arias [interposing]. Yes.
Mr. Moulton [continuing]. You should know what their policy
is with mode shift, and their mode shift policy is very
deliberately to get trucks off the highways and move those
freight moves to rail, because it is more efficient, because it
produces fewer emissions.
So, Europe, which is ahead of us on climate policy--and,
look, I am a Democrat. I care about climate policy. I believe
in the science. I want to reduce emissions.
But if your rule shifts more traffic from rail to trucks,
it will do the opposite of your intention. It will actually
raise emissions, which is why Europe has a policy explicitly in
the opposite direction.
So, let's come up with a policy that shifts traffic off of
trucks onto the railroads. It will not only be better for
emissions, it will be better for public safety because accident
rates, deaths from accidents on rail are much smaller than by
truck. That is the policy that we need.
California's going to spend about $30 billion this year
subsidizing highways. If you came up with a policy to electrify
railroads, you might have a winner.
But this seems like a loser to me.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields.
I now recognize Mr. LaMalfa for 5 minutes.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for this
hearing.
Ms. Arias, when you talk about, early on in your
conversation, that within 1 mile of the tracks is 90 percent of
the emissions, don't we have to acknowledge when towns are
first built and settled? They were either along the coast, with
ports, they were along rivers. And with the advent of railroads
across the country, towns located right next to the railroad
because in any case, they want major sources of transportation
to move freight, people, et cetera.
And so, kind of implied with what you're saying is that
maybe all towns need to be at least a mile away from railroad
tracks to not have emissions, and then you have to acknowledge,
too, that sometimes the rails were there, sometimes the airport
was there first, that property is cheaper next to those because
it is not as desirable. And so, they move homes into those
areas only because they are cheap and people with lower incomes
can afford to move into them.
So, whose fault is it really that people live near these
areas: developers or people that choose to buy homes in these
areas? You have to look at that on the other side.
So, Ms. Arias, when CARB fully acknowledges that people are
going to go out of business, especially short line railroads,
which are an important integral part of what the long lines
can't do and what we don't--what Mr. Moulton was even talking
about, do we want to shift this to trucks?
How can you, in good faith, develop a policy that you fully
acknowledge is going to put an important sector out of
business, and at the end of the day, drive up emissions? How
does that work?
Ms. Arias. Thank you for the question, sir.
As it relates to the analysis that we have in our report,
that report does not take into account any sort of the
incentive programs or other opportunities we might be able to
work with the Class III railroads. As mentioned earlier, there
has been a significant application pool this year to help the
Class IIIs get to compliant engines.
In addition, we intend to support them and work with them
to continue to seek those fundings as we are moving forward. We
are also specifically talking to each of the class lines
individually and trying to determine what is the cheapest and
easiest way for them to move through the regulation----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. OK. Let me stop you there
because maybe there is no way for them to move through the
regulation. They are small outfits. They don't make a ton of
money in order to change this technology.
Mr. Olvera, and Mr. Nober as well, when they talk about
availability of Tier 4 engines, which my stats here show me if
we are at Tier 4 engines, if you just took a breath for a
minute at CARB and let everybody come up to Tier 4, you are
achieving 85 to 90 percent cleaner versus older technology.
That sounds like a win to me, but you are already jumping ahead
to 5 or 6 or all-electric.
And Ms. Arias, you are saying, like, well, we can take this
diesel engine out of a Tier 3 or 2 or whatever, and we will put
this newer one in. You don't say that you are going to put a
new diesel engine in. You are talking about putting in an all-
electric thing that doesn't even exist yet.
How does that work because--well, I want Mr. Nober or Mr.
Olvera to talk about that for a moment. How is the Tier 4
availability of those engines coming along here? Can we even
replace everything with Tier 4 at this moment? Ms. Arias said
there was new technology as of about 2015. That is only a few
years ago. Do we expect all of these things to have been
changed to Tier 4 by now?
Mr. Olvera. Tier 4 engines are limited in availability, and
with locomotives or railroads requiring their locomotives to
all upgrade at an abrupt timeframe, that limited inventory is
going to be taken over very quickly----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. So, we are jumping past Tier 4
with this mandate, right? We haven't even filled out Tier 4
availability. They want 5 or 6, or whatever number you want to
call it, right?
Mr. Olvera. Yes. There are very few locomotives in the
short line industry that are at Tier 4 level. My railroad was
one of the pioneers jumping to Tier 3 engines back starting in
2008. At the time, that was the best available, or highest tier
available, but Tier 4 is just getting started.
Mr. LaMalfa. Well, it is a lot like the trucks in
California. They say, Hey, get up to this newest tier from 2011
or newer, and you will be fine for a long time. And then, wham,
they change the regs, and those trucks now have to be phased
out by 2030. The same as people in good faith trying to do
their local--Mr. Nober, touch on that, too, please, Tier 4
availability and the massive 85, 90 percent cleaner if we were
just all Tier 4.
Mr. Nober. So, as I indicated before, when Tier 4s were
first required, it took a long to time to iron out the
operational issues with them, and only one manufacturer has
ever actually been able to produce working Tier 4 locomotive--
--
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Currently.
Mr. Nober. Currently. When they first came out, then,
again, there were many problems with them and they kept
breaking down. And for a railroad, at least at BNSF where I
used to work, they have to operate in Arizona in 120 degrees in
the summer, and Montana and minus 50 in the winter on a 24-by-7
basis.
And if there is a failure, that becomes a significant issue
in a network industry, and so, reliability is a very important
factor, I think.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK. Thank you.
And here we are jumping past a tier that isn't even ready
yet with new regs with nondiesel engines, right?
Mr. Nober. I don't think that there are--I mean, again, I'm
not a locomotive expert, but I don't think that there are
feasible----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. I guess I have got to yield
back.
Mr. Nober [continuing]. I don't think that there are
feasible locomotives that----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. I have got to reclaim my time,
sir. Thank you. Sorry about that.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. Thank you so very much.
Mr. Carson, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Carson. Thank you, Chairman.
Ms. Arias, opponents of California's and EPA's clean air
standards complain about the cost of compliance as a burden to
business profits. But for a valid analysis, there should be a
review of the benefits compared to the costs. Yet, I am not
hearing anybody really talk about the cost to human health and
well-being in the long term and short term, especially of the
damage of unchecked air emissions.
This is especially a problem with disproportionately
negative impacts on minority communities, and minority workers,
quite frankly. Please describe some of the health dangers and
costs of failing to fix these toxic emissions?
Ms. Arias. Thank you, sir.
When it comes to our regulation, there are multiple health
impacts, including premature deaths, hospitalizations, asthma,
lost workdays, on and on, heart issues. It goes on and on.
When we did our regulation, we are required to provide an
analysis to our board with all of the information that we have.
We were able to provide a cost of the rule to industry, which
we have mentioned, of $13.8 billion. We were also able to
provide to the board what we call a monetized health benefit,
which is the cost to Californians on their health as we achieve
the rule.
We were able to calculate that the benefits of this rule
would be $32 billion for Californians. So, $13.8 billion cost
to industry to comply, and we, as Californians, would save $32
billion.
We also added into the rule a cost should the whole fleet
have to turn over nationwide. That cost would be $86 billion is
our best estimate. We do not have the data to be able to
provide you and the other Members what the monetized health
benefits would be.
If you could compel UP and BNSF to give that to us, we
would be happy to do that, but on our best estimate, we believe
that this rule could provide $200 to $300 billion in health
benefits to the Nation for just one line, one class, UP and
BNSF, not all of them.
Mr. Carson. Thank you. I yield back, Chairman.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields.
I now recognize Mr. Stauber for 5 minutes.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
There is a consistent message from this administration that
electrification is good for the environment. However, my good
friend, Mr. Westerman, challenged the Secretary of the
Department of Transportation 2 weeks ago on whether it really
is the most clean and efficient pathway forward.
While Secretary Buttigieg and other elites can endorse
electrification and feel good driving their EVs, it is really
concerning that these people just shut their eyes and ears off
to the world around them because electrification comes at a
cost, and the supply chain to get the end product is full of
pollution and human suffering. I am talking about child slave
labor to get the cobalt for those batteries.
We know without question that 33 percent of the cobalt is
mined by child slave labor and that is a fact. Nobody disputes
that. Fifteen of the nineteen mines in the Congo owned by the
Chinese Communist Party use child slave labor. Zero
environmental standards and zero labor standards.
While Secretary Buttigieg admitted that child slave labor
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for critical minerals
needed for electrification is wrong, and he committed to
eliminating such horrors in our supply chain, the Secretary has
not once called on the President to rescind the MOU with the
DRC. It makes you wonder where the priorities really are, but I
digress.
We really can't talk about electrification until we are
willing to have an honest conversation about the supply chain
in its entirety.
Mr. Nober, you made an interesting observation in your
testimony about the CARB rule, similar to the one I just made
on electrification as a whole, that certain decisions can make
one group feel like they are making a good decision, yet
completely neglect the fact that it comes at a great cost.
Can you speak about the increased emissions we would likely
see as a result of this rule?
Mr. Nober. Well, Mr. Stauber, I think that, just to that
point, CARB, when they--they did talk about the health benefits
to Californians and the costs in California and then estimated
health benefits nationwide, which could only come if their
regulations forced railroads to adopt those technologies
nationwide.
The other alternative, though, is not to adopt technology
that doesn't exist nationwide but, instead, to divert cargo
that currently goes through California to other States. So, if
cargo comes in and it goes by truck, that creates congestion.
The congestion on both California roads and wherever else it
might go is going to create pollution.
And then, if cargo goes on ships longer, it goes to the
gulf coast and it goes to the east coast, or it goes to other
States on the west coast or to Mexico and Canada, then it is
going to travel longer and then those emissions have to be
looked at as well.
So, yes, there are health benefits nationwide if all
locomotives were zero emissions, but there aren't nationwide
zero-emissions locomotives, and my understanding is that it is
not going to be for a very long time.
And instead, if you looked at increased truck traffic and
increased rail traffic by other communities, would that offset
the benefits? And that is what a nationwide rulemaking would
look at, what is the effective mode shift and try to model
that. I don't know what would happen.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you.
Mr. Nober. We have to look at that.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you.
Mr. Olvera, when you saw the CARB analysis noting that
there would likely be elimination of businesses like yours,
what was your reaction? And did the analysis feel flippant or
apathetic?
Mr. Olvera. Yes. I was, obviously, concerned for my
railroad who employs 50 people in our community, but most of
our customers employ thousands of folks in our community. I
think the elimination of a cost-effective and efficient rail
freight option to our shippers and our customers would increase
their cost and alter their businesses as well and possibly
jeopardize job opportunities in our community.
Mr. Stauber. I will tell you that--in just the last couple
seconds I have left--I think that, Ms. Arias, you have a tough
job selling California standards to the rest of the Nation. I
have been here going on 6 years, and I want nothing to do with
California.
I have had an expert sit in that same chair and tell me in
northern Minnesota that me and my constituents have to take
more scooters to work. It is 35 below. We are not taking
scooters to work and from work.
This is the problem. We have one State that tries to force
this upon our great Nation. In fact, sometimes, oftentimes we
look at California and do just the opposite, just the opposite.
I really do believe you are well-intentioned, but I don't agree
with the philosophy and how you are going about it.
Mr. Olvera just said he would lose 50 workers if they shut
him down and other Tier 1 suppliers. This is about jobs and
economy. And you know what, you can follow the rules, meet the
emissions, and it will still not be good enough for some
people. You will still punish those railroads and other small
businesses across this Nation that want to do right.
And I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields.
I recognize Ms. Foushee for 5 minutes.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the
witnesses for being here with us today.
Recently, Innovative Rail Technologies announced that it
will deliver the first of two battery-electric switcher
locomotives for operational use in Hertford County, North
Carolina, in 2024 as part of a public-private partnership
between the county and the Nucor Steel Corporation.
Ms. Arias, can you speak to the current state of zero-
emissions locomotives development, and can you also touch on
ways the railroad industry can work with CARB if it cannot meet
the timeline set by the current regulation?
Ms. Arias. Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
There are, today, zero-emission locomotives available to be
ordered, and in fact, UP and BNSF have ordered them. There are,
in fact, switchers available today. There is one operating in
our San Pedro port by PHL line, and, in fact, they worked with
us to apply for four more.
We know that today, you can buy zero-emission tender cars
so that you can do the reconfiguration that we talked about
earlier. We know that catenary is available, and you can do the
reconfiguration that we talked about earlier. There is zero-
emission technology available today. We will continue to track
it. We expect that it will continue to increase and cost will
continue to go down.
However, we also understand that that can be expensive. We
understand that it may be harder for our smaller fleets like
our Class IIIs. We have built in several opportunities within
the reg so that they can come talk to us, work with us on
alternative compliance plans. If we are able to approve an
alternative compliance plan, they will not have the spending
account obligation.
There is also an alternative fleet milestone option, which
a lot of our passenger train fleets have noted that they will
take advantage of. We believe it could also be an option. Same
thing, if we are able to work with the fleets and figure out if
that path works for them, they will not have the spending
account obligation.
We also have various extensions in the rule. We do have
hardship extensions. We have extensions if the OEMs are not
able to deliver on time. We have extensions for manufacturer
issues if any of the other parts they cannot get on time. We
have extensions for infrastructure.
Last, we have reached out to each and every operator in our
State and are trying to work with them one-on-one to ensure the
least cost, most health benefit option moving forward so that
we can get to zero emission in the least costly way and
continue to transition our fleet as we have done with all the
other fleets.
California has been able to transition our freight to zero
in many cases, and we want to continue to do that, and we have
been able to do it in a very successful economic way.
Mrs. Foushee. So, the EPA introduced Tier 4 locomotive
emission standards nearly two decades ago, requiring that
emissions or particulate matter and nitrogen oxide be reduced
by about 90 percent from Tier 3 levels. Since then, Class I
railroads seem to have avoided making substantial upgrades
needed to reduce emissions with only approximately 7 percent of
active Class I locomotives being Tier 4.
Can you speak to why Class I railroad companies have failed
to make the investments needed to improve locomotive emissions
after the current Federal standards were enacted?
Ms. Arias. Thank you, ma'am.
I wish I could speak to that. They have anecdotally told us
multiple times that there are issues with Tier 4. Yet every
time we ask for any sort of data or information as to what
those issues are, we have never been able to receive it.
So, we can't answer for you what they perceive to be the
issues as it relates to Tier 4 engines.
Mrs. Foushee. One final question.
Emissions from the railroad industry in the form of carbon
dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter have
significantly impacted the health of many vulnerable
communities that live near rail yards and rail lines across the
United States. What effect will CARB's in-use locomotive
regulations have on the lives and health of these communities,
a similar question that has been asked by a couple of my
colleagues?
Ms. Arias. Yes, ma'am. Thank you for that.
The communities that are directly within a mile of the rail
lines and the rail yards, 90 percent of those are disadvantaged
communities, as you have mentioned. With this rule, the
reduction of diesel of 90 percent reduction would reduce their
cancer risk.
On top of it, obviously, when we are starting to look at
the regional aspects, the emissions from these engines don't
stay just within 1 mile, unfortunately. They do impact the
whole basin. That is where we start to look at the premature
deaths, the hospital visits, the lost workdays, all the other
health benefits.
But back to the communities that are within that 1 mile,
they certainly, on top of all of these other health benefits
that we mentioned, are at much higher risk of cancer due to the
exposure to diesel every day and ongoing.
Mrs. Foushee. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you.
Mr. Johnson, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Mr. Chairman, I would observe
that a number of my colleagues have talked about railroads
today, in really dark, I think, starkly dark terms, in essence,
saying that their existence is a symbol of historic oppression
to people of color. And, of course, I can't speak to
everybody's experience or the experience of every community,
but I can speak to my experience and the experience more
generally of South Dakota.
Growing up in Fort Pierre,I grew up near the railroad.
Growing up or living in Vermillion, living in Mitchell, living
in Pierre and all of these towns, there was the railroad right
close to my house. That wasn't a coincidence. That wasn't an
accident.
If you overlay the historic map of where did the South
Dakota towns go with where the railroad tracks had been built,
you would find an almost perfect overlap. Every 10 miles
another town was formed because that is where the locomotives
needed to fill up with water.
People didn't move there because of oppression. They didn't
view this railroad as a symbol of somebody hating them or
trying to drag them down. They viewed the railroad as a symbol
of opportunity and economic activity. And I guess I just want
to mention that to provide a little fuller picture of the
historic impact of railroads on communities: without railroads
there would be no South Dakota.
In fact, in South Dakota, when you look at those
communities, the densest communities of people of color, that
would generally be on our Native American reservations. They
are not well-served by rail, and they are almost, without
exception, seeking investments in rail because they do not view
that rail as a symbol of oppression. They view that rail as
economic opportunity to lift themselves and their communities
up.
I just want to make sure we provide a fuller context before
we move on.
So, we have a proposed rule before us that would, I think,
almost ridiculously cause Class I railroads moving goods from
South Dakota into California to, once they reach the California
border, to stop, take off that locomotive, and, instead, get a
new zero-emission locomotive, a zero-emission locomotive which
despite some of the other claims we have had today, let's be
clear, are not widely available in the commercial sense today.
In fact, we don't really know when they would be widely
available. This is all very aspirational.
There has also been some discussion about this cost-benefit
analysis. Ms. Arias, give us a sense. The $86 billion impact
that your agency calculated, what number did that put on the
delays that would be felt as secondary and tertiary impacts up
the supply chain?
Ms. Arias. Good question. We do not do analysis of
secondary impacts to the supply chain. It solely calculates the
cost should the UP and BNSF determine that they would need to
replace the whole fleet.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. OK, so, let's be clear. The
assumption of your analysis is that this is not a regulation
that impacts California. It is a regulation that impacts the
entire United States or, in essence, any place that is served
by the UP and the BNSF. And I know, ma'am, you know enough
about their networks to understand how incredibly far reaching
that is.
Ms. Arias. They have mentioned that they do not prioritize
a fleet within the State, so, we understand that, and----
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota [interrupting]. OK, so,
California is attempting to make a rule not that governs
Californians but that governs the United States of America.
So, I want to make sure that I understand what you said,
ma'am, because your analysis had a zero cost to supply chain
impacts. I want to make sure I am understanding what you said.
Did you say that there is not a single instance of a Class I
railroad providing you any information on the challenges of
securing Tier 4 locomotives? Is that accurate?
Ms. Arias. That is correct.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Not a single instance?
Ms. Arias. They have not given us any data to indicate what
the actual issues are. They have anecdotally told us that there
are issues with Tier 4, but every time we ask, we are not given
the data as to what the issues are.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. OK, so, they have not been
forthcoming at all?
Ms. Arias. They have not.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. They just speak in
generalities?
Ms. Arias. They have not.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. So, if your evidentiary record
is that thin, ma'am, how can you possibly promulgate this far-
reaching rule that, by your own admission, governs America?
I would just--I would hope my colleagues--now, listen. We
don't do it perfectly either, ma'am, but I would hope we would
have a little bit heftier evidentiary record before we decide
to govern our country with such a far-reaching decision.
Mr. Nober, let's turn to you. I have talked a little bit
about the constitutional sort of preemption issues. In 30
seconds, sir, what can you tell us?
Mr. Nober. Well, as I talked about in my testimony, the
Interstate Commerce Act is intended specifically to preempt not
just State regulation of rail operations but other Federal laws
that have the effect of impacting rail operations and
regulating them, and that is what would happen here.
So, you would either have to--the California actions would
be, in my opinion, clearly preempted, and if the EPA authorized
them, it is really to authorize in-use in the State of
California, they would have to declare an emergency. They would
have to show that there were--there are some other standards
that they would have to meet.
And then they, at the same time, they would also have to
show that that could be harmonized with the Interstate Commerce
Act, which I don't think they could.
And just if I could add one more thing, in addition to the
towns being 10 miles apart in South Dakota, major towns are
probably 90 miles apart, because that is how far you had to
service a steam locomotive.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. I yield.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields.
I now recognize Mr. DeSaulnier for 5 minutes.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
This brings back some fond memories when I served. Ms.
Arias, I don't know if you were there when I was on the air
resources board.
Ms. Arias. I was, sir. Nice to see you again.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Nice to see you.
I was a Republican then. I was appointed by Pete Wilson and
served under three Governors, two Republicans and a Democrat,
and that was in an age where there was a different perspective,
at least in the California Republican party.
And I am reminded that Richard Nixon signed the U.S. Clean
Air Act, and Ronald Reagan, Governor Ronald Reagan signed the
California Clean Air Act, which governs all of this that we are
talking about.
So, U.S. EPA, their standard reads, ``According to the
Clean Air Act'' signed by Richard Nixon, ``section 209, State
Standards, EPA shall grant an authorization under section 209,
unless the Administrator finds that California,'' quote, ``was
arbitrary and capricious in its finding that its standards are
in the aggregate, at least as protective or of public health
and welfare as applicable Federal standards.''
Number two, ``does not need such standards to meet
compelling and extraordinary conditions,'' or that
``California's standards and accompanying enforcement
procedures are not consistent with this section.''
Ms. Arias, obviously, you and your attorneys feel like you
have made that criteria.
Ms. Arias. Yes, sir. We have put it in writing multiple
times as to what we believe we have and how we have met those
specific requirements.
Certainly, this has not been an arbitrary effort. As you
are very aware, we were working on trying to reduce emissions
from rail even when you were on the board. This particular
rulemaking has taken over 6 years to be able to bring to the
CARB board for consideration.
Certainly, the South Coast and San Joaquin air basins, as
long as the toxic diesel contamination warrants and requires
this legal action by us for the State.
So, we have, in fact, believe met all of the requirements
as necessary and encouraged EPA to approve our authorization as
soon as possible.
Mr. DeSaulnier. And could you speak a little bit to the
public health benefits of the rule?
Ms. Arias. Absolutely. The health benefits themselves are
going to be a monetized health benefit of $32 billion just for
the State of California. That compares to the $13.8 billion
that we assume will cost the industry. As you know, those costs
are very conservative. They definitely could do it cheaper, but
we don't want to underestimate.
The monetized health benefits are also not all the benefits
we know we will achieve. There are other benefits like cancer
reduction that we are not currently able to monetize. All we
can do is tell the board how much we will reduce the exposure,
which, in this case, is 90 percent.
So, in reality, the monetized health benefits are certainly
a lot higher. We just don't have the data to be able to provide
that to the board.
Mr. DeSaulnier. And you are required to do those cost
benefits, as I remember, during----
Ms. Arias [interposing]. Yes, we are.
Mr. DeSaulnier [continuing]. Republican administrations by
the California Clean Air Act.
Ms. Arias. Yes, we are. And it is reviewed by the
Department of Finance independently before we take it to the
board.
Mr. DeSaulnier. So, in terms of the questions, with all due
respect to my friend, the chairman, we already did that, I
would opine, at a higher level than would have been done under
Federal law.
I remember years ago sitting in hours in southern
California in the valley on the diesel train idling rule and
the EJ issues that the ranking member has brought up, and I
remember, quote, at those hearings saying, ``you could have
spent money on compliance,'' meaning the industry, ``or you
could have spent money on lobbyists and lawyers.'' And I would
add a caveat to campaign contributions. That strikes me as what
is going on here.
Yes, there is a burden to the industry, and I recognize
that as a former small business owner, but the cost to my mind
is long overdue. The valley particulate matter has been amongst
the worst in the country.
You made a comment in your opening comments about carbon.
Yes, carbon is true, but particulate matter is what kills
people. People die because of these emissions.
The trucking industry didn't want to do it either. It took
a long time. I remember sitting in those long hearings where
the truckers drove around the EPA building in Sacramento for
hours, and it was hard for small truckers, but we had them do
it.
So, it only seems fair to me for those people who have
invested as other stakeholders in dealing with the public
health issues and the cost to their business that you are
required to do it.
Ms. Arias, just quickly. I have four refineries in the
county I represent. Two of them are changing to biodiesel. How
soon can we expect that as a fuel that would help with this?
Ms. Arias. Yes, we actually have been working on some data
as it relates to drop-in fuel opportunities for the rail lines.
We are interested in looking at that a little bit more. Again,
it gets back to the alternative compliance plan option. None of
the rail yards or none of the rail lines have come in and said
that they are interested in that, but we certainly are
interested in something that could be used now to achieve those
additional reductions.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Mr. Chairman, I will just comment. The
petroleum companies believe they do have a model to comply and
have biodiesel that will work in these locomotives.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields.
I now recognize Mr. Mann for 5 minutes.
Mr. Mann. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, Mr. Chairman,
thanks for having this hearing. This has been very eye-opening,
and this is why we do this. And you read the materials ahead of
time, but it is very eye opening to me to hear that there is a
regulation that's trying to be rolled out in California that
there is no way to comply with. Meanwhile, the intention seems
to be to roll this out to the rest of the country. A grave
concern and that is why we need to have this hearing.
I represent a big ag district in Kansas. Kansas is home to
14 individual freight railroads that connect our manufacturers,
our farmers, our producers, and our natural resources to
domestic and foreign customers.
Kansas is home to a robust series of short line operators
with my district alone containing seven operators and 1,777
miles of track--not 1,776--1,777 miles of track that facilitate
rural communities, terminal operations around the Kansas City
area and the agriculture industries. Combined, these railroads
have nearly 40 million tons of freight across Kansas annually
and serve as an economic driver for our economy.
Communities across Kansas have been important rail hubs for
more than a century, and the implementation of the CARB rule
would jeopardize the reliability and affordability of freight
rail transportation and disrupt our supply chains in Kansas.
It was mentioned earlier, and I think we've got to not
overlook the fact that this rule will be inflationary, and
there is all of this talk about inflation, but one of the
reasons is all of these rules and regulations that we have that
just drives up cost, this will be inflationary and it will be
passed on to consumers.
A few questions, the first couple for you, Mr. Olvera.
Please elaborate on the harmful effects that this rule will
have on short line operators for you, and then if it is rolled
out nationally. And specifically, will this rule jeopardize
short line operators' ability to stay in business?
Mr. Olvera. Yes. I will first speak to California short
lines. The typical California short line is a very small
business, small operator, operates on very thin margins. To
propose, even with State and Federal funding, to upgrade their
locomotives to the level that the CARB rule is requiring in
such an abrupt period of time, they just financially can't do
it. They will go out of business.
Losing those types of efficient and cost-effective freight
options will take their customers' product to be moved at a
much higher cost, and that absolutely would pass on a higher
cost to the end user, to the customer.
For my railroad, we would, essentially, in order to comply,
have to use all of our capital expenditure dollars hopefully
coupled with Federal funding to transfer and upgrade our
current 11 locomotive fleet to Tier 4 fleet. What that does is
it jeopardizes the other capital expenditure projects that we
would have in place.
Most of the projects that we deal with are crossing-related
and track-related. Crossing-related, you jeopardize the safety
of the public. Thousands of cars in our community go over those
crossings. You jeopardize the safety of our employees.
And then on track upgrades, typically, we are upgrading
those tracks to handle heavier loads and to help get rid of the
potential derailments.
Mr. Mann. Thank you.
The feedback I am getting from short line railroads that
operator in Kansas is exactly that. These are high-capital,
low-margin businesses, and when you suck up all of their
capital improvement dollars going towards just upgrading
locomotives instead of making safety improvements on the track
and other expansion, there is a cost to that for the overall
society.
I appreciate that. And by the way, short lines are telling
me in Kansas if this rule goes into effect, they will go out of
business, which means all of our farmers and ranchers that are
trying--all of our farmers that are producing crops aren't
going to have railheads to take their crop to, which means it
is going to have to be truck which means more trucks on the
road.
If your only metric is the environment, it will be bad for
the environment, not to mention the fact it is going to
dramatically increase our food prices. We have got to be
thoughtful about these regulations.
A quick question for you, Ms. Arias. You said earlier that
you had no interest in mode shifts from rail to truck. Won't
this rule do just that?
Ms. Arias. We don't believe so. We have looked at various
analyses of mode shift. We have looked at various analyses of
deferment of freight to other ports. We believe there is enough
profit margin from a container moving on rail to allow for the
upgrade of the technology.
We also are very aware that there is almost a doubling of
the amount of freight that is being projected to come through,
and so, we will need all modes, but we need them to----
Mr. Mann [interrupting]. Did your analysis look into the
safety concerns of this? In other words, when railroads have to
divert so many capital dollars to upgrading their engines away
from crossings and everything, did the safety aspect of this
hit your analysis?
Ms. Arias. It did. It did come up. The railroads provided
that information to us as well as provided it directly to our
board.
Mr. Mann. Thank you.
I see my time has expired. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield
back.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. The gentleman yields.
I now recognize Mr. Carter for 5 minutes.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank
you to our witnesses who are joining us today.
My district in southeast Louisiana at the mouth of the
Mississippi River is a critical point for national commerce. It
is home to the Port of South Louisiana, one of the Nation's
leaders in total tonnage, as well as the Port of New Orleans,
the only deepwater port served by all six Class I railroads.
Along with their neighboring deepwater ports near the end
of the river, they account for approximately 70 percent of our
Nation's grain exports, among other critical items. Continued
rail operation through these ports is critical for both our
local economy and the Nation at large.
However, we bear the scars of industry and commerce. While
I completely support industry, we must continue finding ways to
make it safer, cleaner for the people that live in its close
proximity.
I live in an area that, unfortunately, is sometimes
referred to as--I represent, rather, an area that is sometimes
referred to as cancer alley, a distinction that we don't like,
a distinction that we would like to correct.
Because of the large amount of petrochemical plants,
industry, and activity in that area, neighbors are forced to
live with things that many other neighbors are not. We know
that many of these plants and entities that emit problematic
carcinogens or problematic particulates are situated in poor
communities, communities of Black and Brown.
While I support trade and commerce, it cannot continue to
be at the expense of the health of our communities. I am
committed to working with both industry to make sure that we
have strong economies, but also making sure that we have
healthy communities that are economically prosperous.
So, my question, Ms. Arias, freight train routes run
through or parallel to communities of color and low-income
communities, which bear disproportionate health burdens due to
their proximity to toxic emissions from locomotives.
However, according to the EPA, Tier 4 locomotives have 90
percent lower particulate matter emissions and 80 percent lower
nitrogen oxide emissions than Tier 2. How have communities in
California been impacted by the close proximity to these rail
yards and rail lines? And how might this change with the
implementation of cleaner locomotives?
Ms. Arias. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question.
Our communities, very much like your community, we see that
90 percent of the communities within 1 mile of our rail lines
and our rail yards are our disproportionate communities of
color. They are at higher risk of cancer. They are at higher
risk of other health impacts associated with these diesel
engines.
All of our communities within the nonattainment areas are
also impacted because this pollution does not stay local. It
does go regional, also global issues.
From our rule alone, we are hoping to be able to save 3,200
premature deaths. We are also hoping to save 1,500 ER visits
and hospital visits. There are other benefits, as I mentioned
earlier, a 90-percent reduction in exposure to these
communities from this diesel toxic.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Is there a safe threshold for
which----
Ms. Arias [interrupting]. There is no safe threshold to
diesel.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana [continuing]. People can breathe
particulate matter?
Ms. Arias. There is absolutely no safe threshold to diesel,
which is why we need to transition to zero-emission operations.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. So, when we talk about lowering,
we talk about modifying, none of it, none of it is acceptable?
Ms. Arias. No.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Is that correct?
Ms. Arias. That is correct.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. And while commerce is clearly
important and while industry is clearly important, nothing
trumps the health of a community because if you have an
unhealthy community, you cannot have a healthy economy.
Mr. Olvera, you mentioned the rail line was the recent
recipient of a CRISI grant funding to upgrade your locomotives
to low-emitting Tier 4 vehicles. The CRISI program is now four
times larger than before due to investments from the program of
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Would you like to continue
to see the program funded at the same level going forward? What
would that mean for operators like you who are trying to lower
their emissions?
Mr. Olvera. So, first off, it is essential for CRISI
funding to continue and hopefully continue even at larger
levels----
Mr. Carter of Louisiana [interrupting]. So, that is a yes?
You do support it and you would like to see it at higher
levels?
Mr. Olvera. I absolutely support CRISI funding. The short
answer for us is that we are unable to comply with the CARB
rule without the assistance of CRISI funding. Even with that,
it is a big financial burden on our company, and, like I
mentioned, other short lines just won't be able to comply.
But it is estimated that short lines in the Nation have
about $12 billion of needed funds to upgrade infrastructure,
rail assets, and modernize their railroads.
And so, in the most recent CRISI funding, there was a few
hundred million dollars that were allocated to short lines,
which is much appreciated, but you can see the discrepancy
between the current funding and the ultimate need. We need it
more often and more of it.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Some of my colleagues intimated
that they were concerned about these regulations threatening to
possibly shut you down. If you did not have access to CRISI
funds, would that likely threaten you even further to being in
demise?
Mr. Olvera. Absolutely. I will use an average of a new Tier
4 locomotive costs several millions of dollars. When we
recently applied and was awarded CRISI funding, our portion is
approximately $1 million. But on a standalone basis, if my
railroad had to pay $4 million-plus for each of our 11
locomotives to be upgraded, it's just not feasible. We wouldn't
be able to comply.
Mr. Carter of Louisiana. My time has expired. Thank you,
sir.
I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields.
I now recognize Mr. Yakym for 5 minutes.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our
witnesses for being here and for the time to sound the alarm
and sound the alarm bell on this important issue.
One of the reasons I love our system of Government is that
it empowers States to be laboratories of democracy, to
experiment with new policies and see what works.
My home State of Indiana has a proud tradition of
innovative thinking that has allowed us to not just craft
policies that work best for Hoosiers, but even to export some
of these ideas to other States or even to the Federal level.
The Railroad Crossing Elimination Program is a great example of
us doing just that.
Now, California is a State blessed with natural beauty and
fertile agricultural land, but its laboratory has been littered
with, frankly, terrible ideas. It spent $24 billion to fight
homelessness over the last 5 years, but has no data on whether
the money actually reduced homelessness.
California's high-speed rail boondoggle was initially
estimated to cost $33 billion but nearly 20 years later, there
is still no timeline for completion and it might need another
$100 billion.
Its defund-the-police policies have hollowed out once
bustling city centers, and it managed to turn a $100 billion
budget surplus into a $45 billion deficit in just 2 years. That
might be a record.
What I don't want and what Hoosiers in my district don't
want is to be subject to yet another one of California's
unworkable radical climate mandates.
Mr. Nober, CARB has said that Class I railroads like Union
Pacific and BNSF will likely pass on the cost of compliance,
which is upwards of $800 million per year, quote, ``across the
Nation.'' But CARB also argues that this mandate will only
apply to California. Doesn't the fact that the cost will be
spread beyond California mean that this rule impacts interstate
commerce and is, therefore, preempted?
Mr. Nober. Well, I don't think there is any question that
the rule impacts interstate commerce and is, in fact,
preempted, and I think much of the discussion you have heard
today has been about the hope for national impact of this. And
so, that is, while maybe well-meaning, is exactly what this
committee prohibited when it passed the Interstate Commerce
Commission Termination Act and set the law out.
Now, the fact that the cost will be spread nationwide and
the benefits would be local is probably further evidence of the
fact that this is an interstate network system, and one that is
very difficult to have stop at the State border. The same way
that aircraft can't stop at the California State border and
switch out their engines, just because that is just not the
nature of interstate systems like this.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you.
And Mr. Olvera, CARB argues that freight rail operations
like you should just raise rates to compensate for this new
mandate. As a short line operator, can you tell me what this
mandate means to you, your company, and your workers in terms
of inflation and employment?
Mr. Olvera. Yes. So, my railroad is a handling carrier. We
receive our freight rates from our Class I operators. So,
through contract provisions, our short line doesn't have the
ability to raise rates to cover CARB regulation costs. So, we
have no ability to do that.
And the increase in rail freight, if it happens from this
CARB rule, which it has been said that it will absolutely
happen, then our market competitors, trucking, would have more
of an advantage against the railroad and further hurt our
business and our ability to achieve profits and growth.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you.
And Mr. Yal, do you generally agree with Mr. Olvera's
assessment?
Mr. Yal. Yes, I do. In fact, the point about these costs,
their ability to do capital improvements, safety improvements,
and operational improvements, and those budgets going to this
instead of going into, from our side, the construction jobs and
projects that we rely on, that is also a very real issue.
And like Mr. Olvera said, it is just going to shift over to
trucking. That is all that is going to happen.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you.
And Mr. Olvera, is this technology mandated by this rule
readily available and feasible for short line railroads to
acquire?
Mr. Olvera. Did you say electric vehicles?
Mr. Yakym. For short line railroads to acquire. Is the
technology readily available and feasible for you to acquire?
Mr. Olvera. So, first off, on the Tier 4 side, there is one
U.S. manufacturer, Cummins, and those engines are limited in
inventory manufacturing, and as railroads rush to upgrade, that
inventory is going to be depleted.
In terms of battery-charged locomotives, those are in
prototype stages. As it was called out earlier, there might be
a railroad that has one or two in some version of testing, but
in terms of it being commercially available, that is not the
case.
Worst off, for the concept of a battery-charged locomotive,
that requires maybe 24 hours of charging for 8 hours of use. My
diesel engine runs 24/7. So, if I were to replace a diesel
engine with a battery-operated locomotive, I may need two or
three battery-operated locomotives to accommodate that change
with a further larger cost and limited ability to comply.
Mr. Yakym. And finally, it would be accurate to say then
that they are mandating that you buy something that does not
yet exist?
Mr. Olvera. That is correct.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields.
I now recognize Mr. Burlison for 5 minutes.
Mr. Burlison. Thank you.
Mr. Olvera, the freight rail industry is the most fuel-
efficient way of transporting goods across the country, and as
we have heard today, even Republicans and Democrats agree that
it is the cleanest form of transportation in the country. One
would think that we would want to encourage a migration
towards--anyone who would care about the environment would want
to migrate, would want to move freight to rail.
What do you think is the real motivation behind this
mandate?
Mr. Olvera. I think one of the biggest issues with the
mandate is that there haven't been data analyzed for those who
are impacted to truly understand all of the impacts of this
cleaner air initiative. Short lines, and mine included, are not
opposed to cleaner locomotives, but the timeframe in which we
are asked to do this and before certain technology is
commercially available is just not a possibility for us to
comply.
So, I think--so, yes, we are all for----
Mr. Burlison [interrupting]. So, you are saying this is out
of a motivation of an idealistic pipedream? That is what I
would call it.
Mr. Olvera. It is aspirational at best. Everybody would be
for it, but the way to get there is not what is being proposed
through the CARB rule.
Mr. Burlison. I would say that the efforts are delusional
at best.
So, let me ask it in a different way. These efforts are
almost so extreme, one might--it has me wondering if there is
some rent-seeking occurring if companies--the few companies
that make these Tier 4, class 4 engines, like KLW, Siemens,
EMD, Brookville, I wonder, do they have a relationship with the
California Air Resources Board?
Mr. Olvera. I am uncertain. You would have to ask the CARB
representative, but I can't speak to that.
Mr. Burlison. But you are saying that--so, to get a better
idea of the cost--I see what is frustrating, and, Ms. Arias, I
am not asking a question. I am just talking to you. What is
absurd is what California doesn't see that's happening.
Across the country, States like Missouri are receiving
people who are fleeing like refugees this draconian State to
the tune of hundreds of thousands of people a year. They are
coming at a net loss.
California is reducing its size. And why? Because the cost
of living is outrageous, the most expensive State in the
contiguous 48, whether you are talking--in all factors.
Transportation cost, the most expensive State. Housing cost,
food cost. Everything is more expensive in California, and all
you have to do is look at the people that are regulating the
hell out of the cost.
So, Mr. Nober, one might wonder, if you are trying to
improve the supply chain, if you are trying to reduce cost,
would this be a good avenue to do that?
Mr. Nober. Well, I would come back to the point you made a
little bit earlier, Congressman, which is that it is requiring
the adoption of technology by a date certain that doesn't
exist. And what winds up happening is that that deters the
adoption of new technology because businesses don't know if
what they are buying is going to be able to--they are going to
amortize it over its useful life.
And so, I think Mr. Olvera spoke earlier about having
bought Tier 3 locomotives and halfway through their useful
life, they are now going to be not useful and have to upgrade
to Tier 4.
And I think folks looking at this regulation might say, Why
would we invest in any--I am just speculating, but--why would
we invest in any locomotives until there are working zero-
emission locomotives that are operable in the demands of
freight rail, which is 24 by 7 by 365. And the technological
hurdles for that are significant, and I don't think there is an
end date for when that kind of technology will be available.
Mr. Burlison. And the sad part is the reach. You have these
refugees who have migrated to States like Missouri and fleeing
all of this regulatory State, and yet, now the arm of these
California regulators is going to impact people across the
United States financially.
Mr. Nober. I think that is--that will be, one, either a
goal or certainly an effect of the regulation.
Mr. Burlison. Thank you.
My time has expired.
Mr. Duarte [presiding]. The gentleman yields back.
I now recognize myself for 5 minutes.
Well, Mr. Olvera, let's start with you, my fellow
Modestoid. How long have you been at Modesto?
Mr. Olvera. Pretty much all my life.
Mr. Duarte. Fantastic. You look a little younger than me.
I remember a few things in Beard Industrial tract where you
worked that are not there anymore. I know Tri Valley Growers
has been reformed as Signature Food products. Signature Foods,
another major cannery for peaches, is gone. Del Monte is still
there, but we are losing them.
I mean, in fact, I just pulled up--my grandfather was a
peach grower right there along highway--right there along the
Santa Fe railroad lines. I didn't like the train whistles, but
I never felt I was dying from them.
I think we have been on that property for five generations,
about a mile away from the Beard Industrial tract, as farmers.
And we are losing a lot of commerce in Modesto. We are
losing it, and it is sad because as we know, Modesto has got
the Modesto Irrigation District, the second oldest irrigation
district in the State; 1889 I think it was formed, right after
Turlock in 1888.
We have got hydroelectric power. We have got fresh surface
water. We have got the infrastructure of both the railroads
that you serve to the east and to the west of you, which is
critical, and that is why we have the largest canneries, the
largest wineries, the largest spaghetti sauce makers. We have
got the highest tech Frito-Lay plant.
We're not there inside the Tesla trucks and all of the--but
right now, the United States produces .66 percent of the
world's canned peaches. It has fallen 16.99 percent in the last
year, and Brazil and the Netherlands have gone up.
Now, I have always taken pride that Modesto feeds the
world. I have taken pride that we have a local food system.
Is cutting the last speck of emissions a bigger health
priority than a diverse nutritious diet for Americans,
especially a locally or domestically produced food-secure,
domestic diet for Americans, working families especially? I ask
that rhetorically to someone.
No. We are giving up enormous food resources out of America
because of these onerous, idiotic regulatory programs.
Mr. Nober has done a good job today explaining how by doing
this through a waiver, this is establishing national policy
that disrupts our food supply in one of the most critical food
producing regions in the Nation while avoiding the due process
that we normally afford.
If we had due process, we could take into account the
dietary needs of American families and balance them against the
air quality needs of American families. But we chose, we chose
not to do that because we found a loophole, right, Ms. Arias?
Wasn't this convenient not to have to weigh these matters?
Ms. Arias. No, that is never our intention, to ignore
impacts associated with the rule, and as we go through our 6-
year process, we are always interested in any of the impacts
associated with our rules.
Mr. Duarte. A 6-year impact where we know that Tier 4
engines are going to be able to reduce nine-tenths of the air
emissions that the Tier 0 did that Mr. Olvera invested in Tier
3 and now you are getting your first Tier 4s.
Mr. Olvera. Yes.
Mr. Duarte. We are saying, well, we were agnostic as to
whether we go from rail to truck or not, even though trucks are
3X the emissions per ton of food delivered per mile as rail.
But in California, we also know that if we had had a full
transparent public policy process and hearing on this, we would
know that California is not building freeways.
Highway 5 was built when I was born in 1966. It is two
lanes each direction from the bay area down to Bakersfield. We
are building warehouses all up and down that corridor, and we
are not building freeways. We are barely widening 99 to help
people get to work.
This is our food valley. This is the San Joaquin Valley,
the fruit bowl of the Nation. We are not building the trucks we
need. We are outlawing the trains we need. We are weighing the
last air quality increment over affordability.
Do you believe, Ms. Arias, that diet is a key health factor
for working families, low-income families, all families, color;
I don't care. Everybody needs a healthy and diverse diet and
affordable diet.
Ms. Arias. Yes. As an ag business major from Chico, I can
tell you that the agricultural production in our State is very
important.
Mr. Duarte. Did that show up in your public comment program
on this policy proposal?
Ms. Arias. What do you mean, sir?
Mr. Duarte. Did it show up? Did people say we need a
domestic, diverse, nutritious food supply? We need a logistic
system that will actually meet the need of a diverse food
supply? Or was that bypassed by you going through a waiver and
then calculating the benefits nationally but not taking public
input on the cost?
Ms. Arias. No, sir. The ag industry was very vocal about
the necessity to be able to continue to produce agriculture as
we promulgated the rule.
Mr. Duarte. And did they agree with your idea that the last
1 percent of emissions needed to be eliminated and that the
balance of human health would be benefited by increasing the
cost of food, pushing trucks onto overcrowded freeways that we
have a policy in California not to increase the capacity of?
Ms. Arias. The ag industry did not come in support of all
the way through the rule. Yes, they are concerned about the
movement of their product, but we are talking about one-third
of the emissions necessary to meet the Clean Air Act.
Mr. Duarte. Nine-tenths of which you could achieve with
Tier 4 engines, and another three-quarters you can take out by
not pushing it onto their freeways.
Ms. Arias. We certainly are interested in Tier 4 engines.
The industry----
Mr. Duarte [interrupting]. I gavel myself. Thank you.
Ms. Arias [continuing]. Has told us they are not. And if
they were to purchase a Tier 4 engine, they can continue to
utilize it well into the 2050s.
Mr. Duarte. Thank you. I yield back.
And I will recognize Mr. Fong for 5 minutes.
Mr. Fong. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and the witnesses for being
here.
Ms. Arias, good to see you. I recently got elected and
served in the State assembly on the Transportation Committee
and on the Select Committee on Ports and Goods Movement.
So, let me ask this question. In 2005, CARB entered into a
voluntary agreement with BNSF and UP to reduce emissions at
rail yards. The agreement stated, quote, ``The parties
recognized that participating railroads are federally regulated
and that aspects of State and local authority to regulate
railroads are preempted.''
It further stated, quote, ``The Federal Clean Air Act, the
Interstate Commerce Termination Act, and many other laws
established a uniform Federal system of equipment and
operational requirements.''
At that time, CARB acknowledged Federal preemption. So,
what has changed since then?
Ms. Arias. Yes. Thank you for that question. The biggest
change is the technology that is available today. When you look
at the opportunity to reconfigure the existing engines with the
battery tenders or catenary, that was not an option before, and
it is today. That allows us to access our authority to be able
to promulgate a rule for in-use.
We are not regulating the engine manufacturers. In some
cases, they are providing zero-emission technology, but that is
not because of our rule.
The ability to be able to change the power source of an
already electric engine is relatively new and something that
now gives us the ability to do an in-use rule.
Mr. Fong. So, I would say that we can't look at this
regulation and this issue in a vacuum. CARB is imposing
mandates and regulations on all aspects of the supply chain.
So, we are discussing the rail impacts.
CARB has imposed mandates on the trucking industry. CARB is
imposing significant mandates on the ports. So, together, all
of these regulations have devastating impacts on our Nation's
distribution of goods and products.
So, my question is, how does the State of California plan
to mitigate these supply chain disruptions that are clearly
acknowledged and there is a consensus on, and what does CARB
say to the consumer when they have to pay more for goods and
products?
Ms. Arias. Yes, good question. We have, over the years,
heard of many concerns related to our rules and how it is going
to cause diversion of our freight and how it will disrupt the
supply chain.
However, we have also successfully seen these rules be
implemented without supply chain diversion and without supply
chain disruptions.
Our port continue to be the largest ports in the Nation. We
continue to process the largest amount of containers for the
Nation. We continue to provide a lot of food for the Nation----
Mr. Fong [interrupting]. Let me----
Ms. Arias [continuing]. All while being able to transition
to a cleaner freight transport system.
Mr. Fong. Let me just say, though--I apologize for
interrupting--but that empirically is not true. California
ports are losing significant market share to other ports. As
mentioned before by the other witnesses, goods and products are
now not coming to California. They are going to other States,
other ports.
And you now are mandating--so, our trucking industry can't
get engines, our railroads are struggling to afford new
engines, engines that technically are not feasible at this
moment, and then the ports are being mandated to the point
where probably--there is going to be a volume cap on what goes
into the ports, and all of those containers are going to go to
other States.
So, empirically, what you are saying is not true, and the
supply chain inflation that has existed--has occurred in the
past with the supply chain crisis that happened in the
pandemic, consumers paid more.
So, how does the State of California tell the average
consumer they are going to pay more based on this regulation?
Ms. Arias. We have published data that shows that this
regulation could cost each household $36 a year.
And as a point to the ports, they have actually been having
record-breaking years. Yes, there is some diversion of
discretionary containers, but the actual containers coming
through are much higher than they have ever been, and we
continue to project that they will actually double within the
next several decades.
Mr. Fong. So, does your assessment take into account all of
these regulations together, or are you just taking----
Ms. Arias [interposing]. Correct.
Mr. Fong [continuing]. Are you taking this into account for
just----
Ms. Arias [interrupting]. Oh, the $36, sir?
Mr. Fong. Yes.
Ms. Arias. No, the $36 is just this reg.
Mr. Fong. Just for rail?
Ms. Arias. Per year, per household.
Mr. Fong. Right. So, if you add in the trucking
regulations, you add in the port regulations, you add in all
the regulations to the entire supply chain, the system of
systems that moves products; 40 percent of the goods and
products that come into the United States of America come to
the Port of L.A. and Long Beach. So, does your analysis take
into account all of these regulations layered on top of each
other, to the impact to the average consumer?
Ms. Arias. No. We have not done an analysis that shows the
total monetized benefits that we receive from all these rules
compared to the cost per household of these rules.
Mr. Fong. As a Californian, I would say that when it comes
to strengthening our supply chain, California is not the model.
Mr. Duarte. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Kiley for 5
minutes.
Mr. Kiley. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Ms. Arias, you are with CARB, you are the chief of the
transportation and toxics division, correct?
Ms. Arias. Correct.
Mr. Kiley. Thank you for being here with us today, but I do
have to ask, are you an elected official?
Ms. Arias. I am not.
Mr. Kiley. Is anyone at CARB an elected official?
Ms. Arias. Some of our board members are, yes.
Mr. Kiley. But are they acting in an elected capacity when
they make policy at CARB?
Ms. Arias. They are--some of them are elected, but they are
all appointed by our senate and Governor.
Mr. Kiley. They're appointed, not----
Ms. Arias [interposing]. Correct.
Mr. Kiley. OK.
Ms. Arias. Well, they originally may be elected until----
Mr. Kiley [interrupting]. So, you took this opportunity
upon yourselves to issue this new regulation banning
nonelectric trains? Is that correct?
Ms. Arias. The staff promulgated the rule and took it to
the board for their consideration, and they adopted it.
Mr. Kiley. So, it wasn't voted on by the legislature?
Ms. Arias. It was not.
Mr. Kiley. It wasn't voted on by the people of California?
Ms. Arias. It was not.
Mr. Kiley. So, Mr. Chair, I am very glad you called this
hearing because we have really a crisis of democratic
legitimacy in California, where we have an agency, a massive
bureaucracy, CARB, that is making tectonic changes to our
society, not just in California but across the country, without
any measure of democratic accountability and is enacting
harebrained scheme after harebrained scheme that wouldn't even
survive whatever modicum of rationality might be present in the
supermajority legislature.
And it is having dramatic impacts on our State. I mean, you
could flip through the pages of dystopian fiction and not find
an entity quite like CARB in terms of just how completely out
of control and disconnected from the real world it has become,
and I think that this regulation under consideration today
banning nonelectric trains is a perfect example of that.
So, Mr. Olvera, you testified about how currently railroads
are already the most environmentally friendly way to transport
freight across the country, correct?
Mr. Olvera. That is correct. Today, railroads contribute 2
percent of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions,
while our competitor, trucking, contributes 23 percent.
Mr. Kiley. And you have also testified that the technology
to comply with this regulation is not currently in existence.
Is that correct?
Mr. Olvera. That is correct.
Mr. Kiley. And that because of this, short lines such as
your company or others may be forced to shut down. Is that
correct?
Mr. Olvera. That is correct. To comply with the CARB ruling
as written, many short lines in the State of California cannot
comply. They would go bankrupt. And as I explained, my
railroad, we would have to defer lots of other safety-driven
projects in order to comply with the locomotive upgrade.
Mr. Kiley. So, this would shift freight from more
environmentally friendly to less environmentally friendly modes
of transport?
Mr. Olvera. That is correct. It would push more to truck.
It would have a worse impact on emissions.
Mr. Kiley. So, the whole purpose of this regulation, the
ostensible purpose, which is to reduce emissions, it would
actually do just the opposite. It is a self-undermining, self-
defeating regulation.
But, of course, it does a lot more than that in terms of
the collateral damage or cost. You testified that this would
raise costs for consumers, correct?
Mr. Olvera. That is correct.
Mr. Kiley. Making the experience of inflation worse in
California and across the country? Is that correct?
Mr. Olvera. Yes, that is correct.
Mr. Kiley. And in addition to that, you would have more
vehicles on the road which would create more traffic for
drivers, I assume?
Mr. Olvera. More traffic, more congestion, and there were
6,000 deaths related to heavy trucks last year, and that has
been increasing year over year. To put more trucks on our
roads, that number unfortunately would probably increase.
Mr. Kiley. So, more wear-and-tear on the roads, more
accidents, more injuries, more deaths?
Mr. Olvera. That is correct.
Mr. Kiley. And then you have also testified, Mr. Yal, about
some of the other costs in terms of construction costs,
correct?
Mr. Yal. That is correct.
Mr. Kiley. Is it fair to say that this regulation, by
increasing the cost of construction, both in terms of the cost
of materials and the cost of their transport, would increase
the already high cost of housing in California?
Mr. Yal. That is correct, yes.
Mr. Kiley. And you also testified that it would make it
more difficult for us to build new infrastructure. Is that
correct?
Mr. Yal. Yes. Our concern is that if the funds that are
there for passenger rail operators and freight rail operators
that would have been used for capital improvements, which is
what we do, what our industry does, it is going to get diverted
to this effort, and there will be a significant decrease in
available funding through that, in addition to making the cost
of projects bigger and more expensive. So, your dollar goes
just less further.
Mr. Kiley. So, if I have this right, we have an unelected,
not democratically accountable body, that has decided on its
own to make policy not just for California but effectively for
the entire country, and has done so in the name of reducing
emissions but has come up with a policy that will actually
increase emissions, while also increasing costs and inflation
for consumers by putting more vehicles on the road, creating
more traffic, creating more wear-and-tear on our roads,
reducing our road quality, creating more accidents means more
injuries and more death, increasing the cost of construction,
increasing the cost of housing, and making it more difficult to
build new infrastructure.
I am glad we had this hearing, Mr. Chair, because I think
this is exactly the wrong policy for California and for our
country. I yield back.
Mr. Duarte. The gentleman yields back.
We now recognize Mr. Molinaro for 5 minutes.
Mr. Molinaro. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do feel a little
bit out of place as a New Yorker, but I will offer to you that
when California or New York institutes rules or regulations or
new policy, the rest of the country should likely be afraid.
Ms. Arias, I don't want to take issue with where California
is as it relates to your economic activity. The State
represents 14.5 percent of the entire national economy, but I
do want to tell you the tale of once being the empire.
I serve in a State that once was the largest population in
the Nation, was the largest economy in the Nation, once was the
ultimate location for cultural and economic activity--once.
It is actually one of the reasons that we are referred to
as the Empire State. We built the Midwest, thanks to the great
work of the Erie Canal and others.
But now we lead the Nation in outmigration. More people
leave the State of New York to every other State in the Nation
than any other State in the Nation. We shoulder the highest
burden of taxation of any people in the country--even more than
California.
And the answer as to why is because policymakers, elected
and appointed, established rules and regulations that are
unachievable without consideration for the actual impact to the
end user, the end user being the citizen, the taxpayer, the
consumer.
You reference, Ms. Arias, that your analysis, the CARB's
analysis, is simply that there may be disruptions to the supply
chain, but they are surmountable in the near term. Is that
about right?
Ms. Arias. No, we didn't talk about disruptions in the
supply chain for this. I was referring to the overall supply
chain. Sorry if that was----
Mr. Molinaro [interrupting]. So, you acknowledge that this
regulation, this rule, disrupts the supply chain?
Ms. Arias. No, I would say it transforms the supply chain.
Mr. Molinaro. That is a very--it is a lovely word that even
I use. I love it because it avoids the actual truth, which is
disruption is what happens in order for transformation to
occur, if you can achieve it.
But we recognize it is very hard to achieve the goal. In
New York, thanks to California, New York, in establishing the
climate leadership policy, CLCPA, uses basically the same
standard.
It looks across the river and says, we are going to cross
this wild roaring river, but we are not going to tell you how
to build the bridge, and we don't even care if you can build
the bridge.
It is an absurd kind of governance. If we want to get to
the kind of economic and environmental benefit that perhaps
policies like this seem to want to achieve, you must have the
path to get there, and you can't get there from here.
Mr. Olvera, just a few moments ago, Ms. Arias did suggest
that this rule would have a de minimis impact on families
across America. I think she said $36 a year.
First, I will offer to you that that can't be possible, and
second, I would offer to you, Mr. Olvera, that I don't judge
what people can or cannot afford. I always appreciate--and I
mean no disrespect. I was once an appointed official as well,
but I always appreciate when people who aren't elected say to
other people who have to pay the bills, it really won't cost
you that much.
It is sort of like when you say to your kid, it is going to
hurt me more than it hurts you. I get that $36 doesn't sound
like a lot of money. It is impossible that that is the limited
impact, but without question, I am not going to judge what
people can or cannot afford.
CARB's own analysis suggests that this rule, in and of
itself, creates $86 billion in nationwide compliance costs, and
that, of course, these costs are going to disrupt, transform,
and impact the supply chain.
Can you speak to sort of humanize this? How do we expect
the CARB rule to impact the cost of, let's say, groceries, to
the average American family?
Mr. Olvera. Sure. So, today, rail is a very cost-efficient
freight option for our customers. I have heard from different
customers at times, the savings by going through rail freight
versus truck freight is three to four times less. So, that
freight option, the rail freight option, if it was removed and
mandated that our customers had to use a higher expense to move
their goods, that decreases their bottom line, and the only way
to make up for that is to pass on costs to the customer. That
would absolutely increase cost of goods to the end user.
Mr. Molinaro. Sure. And I remember not being here in
Congress when the other side of the aisle did control both
Houses of the legislature, imposed the Inflation Reduction Act.
And I remember elected and bureaucratic leaders suggesting
there would be no impact on inflation, and yet we experienced
the highest rate of inflation in 40 years.
I know, Mr. Olvera, and I won't ask you to answer this
again, but you spoke to the impact that this rule has on
smaller Class II and III railroads. In fact, the rule itself
could exceed their annual operating budgets and likely result
in the decline of those operations.
I don't want to--I have 30 seconds, so, Mr. Nober, I just
want to reference for you, obviously, other States can impose,
and States like New York have imposed, similar rules as it
relates to vehicle emissions.
Can you just suggest to us what are the potential impacts,
let's say, if New York were to--with a single party governing--
Democratic party governing in New York, what would happen if
New York were to adopt a similar rule?
Mr. Nober. Well, I mean, it would again create the kinds of
problems that you don't want to see in interstate commerce,
which is different operating rules and requirements in
different States, so that you can't have interoperable
equipment between--over the 50 States, and that kind of flies
in the face of interstate commerce. So, that would create more
and more patchwork issues, and it would show why this is
preempted.
Mr. Molinaro. Thank you, Mr. Nober.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Nehls [presiding]. Thank you. The gentleman yields.
Are there any further questions from any members of the
subcommittee who have not been recognized? We have 8 minutes.
We are voting right now, so, we have 8 minutes for the Members
to get over there.
I want to have a second round. I want to respect the hell
out of the gentleman to my right, Mr. LaMalfa, but I don't
know--I will tell you what, Mr. LaMalfa, you have got 2
minutes--2 minutes.
Mr. LaMalfa. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate
it greatly.
Ms. Arias, have you taken into account if the requirement--
65 percent of the locomotive fleet would be banned by the year
2030? We have heard repeatedly that the technology for Tier 4,
let alone the later tiers, isn't even working yet to any extent
to replace that many locomotives.
We heard General Van Ovost, who is the head of the U.S.
Transportation Command for our military vehicles.
Have you taken into account the effect of being able to
deploy military vehicles and equipment across the country where
it needs to be, in this study, in this idea?
Because if we can't move that because an electric train can
only go 100 miles or something, what is going to happen with
that? Have you taken that into account as well as----
Ms. Arias [interrupting]. Yes, sir. Military is exempt.
Mr. LaMalfa [continuing]. Perishable ag goods?
Ms. Arias. Yes. Military is exempt.
Mr. LaMalfa. And they said it is OK?
Ms. Arias. Yes. Military is exempt from the rule.
Mr. LaMalfa. Oh, they are exempt from it?
Ms. Arias. Yes.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK. Mr. Olvera, touch on, please, to wrap it
up, on the available--we have heard it glossed over, oh, we
have the technology, we will just take the Tier 3 or 4 diesel
engine out and put electric in, basically. Is that even close
to practical?
Mr. Olvera. The electric locomotive is not currently
commercially available, and as I mentioned before, the
replacement of an electric vehicle, replacing a diesel
locomotive is completely different. Charge time on a battery-
operated locomotive is 24 hours for 8 hours of use. My diesel
engine runs 24/7.
I may need two to three electric locomotives to replace one
diesel engine.
Mr. LaMalfa. So, to replace 65 percent of the locomotives
by 2030, no way, right? Quickly.
Mr. Olvera. I don't see how that is commercially feasible
and possible.
Mr. LaMalfa. Mr. Yal, we are talking about this special
account where they want to take massive amounts of money from
the railroad operators and put it into a special account that
is unavailable for capital for you.
You have a very big project that is being looked at in
Barstow which would massively increase efficiency for
railroads. What is this special account thing tying up all your
finances going to do to you?
Mr. Yal. The project is a $1\1/2\ billion intermodal
railroad facility. It is to be built by BNSF. And the concern
is that this spending account is going to divert resources from
BNSF's capital improvement fund which funds these intermodal
facilities, this one, and there are others----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Quickly. Because it means you
probably are not going to build it because your money is all
tied up?
Mr. Yal. That is what we are hearing, yes.
Mr. LaMalfa. Yes. So, we are going to lose the efficiency
of that new project? Yes.
Mr. Yal. Correct.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I greatly appreciate
the indulgence. Thank you.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. The gentleman yields.
Mr. DeSaulnier is going to get the last word, and you have
a minute.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Mr. LaMalfa, I gave you the chance to have
more time.
Just briefly, there are elected officials on CARB. There
always has been. It is required by the California Clean Air
Act. Again, Ronald Reagan as Governor. I was one of those
representing the districts.
Ms. Arias. Correct.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Number 2, just because CARB passes this
doesn't mean that every State has to go on it as well. They
have to----
Ms. Arias [interrupting]. And, in fact, we have never had
any other State pick up our offered rules.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Right. So, they have to go through their
own legislative process----
Ms. Arias [interposing]. Correct.
Mr. DeSaulnier [continuing]. And then ask for--so, if it is
a national trend, it is not by statute.
Ms. Arias. Correct.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thirdly, you are doing what you are
required by statute because you have to comply and get these
reductions. You can also use the alternative plan to get to
those reductions.
Ms. Arias. Correct.
Mr. DeSaulnier. So, all of those things, I just wanted to
clear up, and thank you, Mr. LaMalfa, and the chairman, for
letting me talk.
Mr. Nehls. Absolutely.
Any further questions from any members of the subcommittee
who have not been recognized?
Seeing none, that concludes our hearing. I would like to
thank each one of you for being here. I thought this was very
informative, very insightful, and thank you for your testimony.
The subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 4:32 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Letter of April 22, 2024, to Hon. Michael S. Regan, Administrator,
Environmental Protection Agency, from Casey Katims, Executive Director,
U.S. Climate Alliance, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Frederica S.
Wilson
April 22, 2024.
The Honorable Michael S. Regan,
Administrator
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW,
Washington, DC 20004.

Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0574

Dear Administrator Regan,
I write to you on behalf of the U.S. Climate Alliance (Alliance), a
bipartisan coalition of 24 governors committed to climate action that
together represent approximately 60 percent of the U.S. economy and 55
percent of the U.S. population. The Alliance appreciates the
opportunity to comment on California's request for an authorization
under the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the In-Use Locomotive Regulation
(IULR), which supports our shared goals to confront the climate crisis,
reduce harmful air pollution, advance environmental justice, and
protect public health. The Alliance has long supported state
flexibility in the CAA that permits California to adopt, and allows
other states and territories to follow, regulations that can be more
protective of public health and welfare than applicable federal
standards. We strongly support authorization of California's IULR rule,
which was promulgated consistent with CAA requirements,\1\ and
encourage EPA to grant it without delay.
Transportation remains the largest source of greenhouse gas
emissions across the Alliance. We agree with the Biden administration
that a rapid deployment of zero-emission (ZE) technologies across all
transportation modes \2\ must be a central component of the U.S. Long-
Term Strategy to confront the climate crisis. Importantly, IULR sets ZE
operating requirements for locomotives that can help achieve these
goals. Granting this authorization will ensure California and other
Alliance members can continue to lead on transportation
decarbonization--driving reductions in transportation emissions at the
state level while ensuring the U.S. does not fall behind in our
national efforts to limit global warming.
California's IULR is also expected to significantly reduce harmful
NOx and PM2.5,\3\ improving public health for tens of millions of
residents in the state. For other Alliance states and territories,\4\
granting the authorization would provide a critical new mechanism to
support compliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards and
protect public health in their jurisdictions. Emissions reductions
achieved from the rule would avoid premature deaths, hospitalizations
for cardiovascular illness, hospitalizations for respiratory illness,
and emergency room visits, yielding billions in health benefits.\3\
IULR also advances environmental justice by reducing disproportionate
exposure to vehicle pollution concentrated in frontline communities,
particularly those surrounding locomotive operations at railyards,
industrial facilities, and rail corridors.\3\
ZE rail technology, such as overhead catenary, is a proven and
established technology in passenger and freight applications both in
the United States and around the world.\5\ Additionally, private
operators along with state and local transportation agencies are
already investing in, testing, and deploying new emerging ZE and ZE-
capable rail technologies like battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell,
and hybrid.\6\ Recognizing the potential of these technologies, the
U.S. Department of Transportation is also supporting their deployment
with recent federal investments.\7\ IULR will advance these efforts by
driving further innovation and investment, and by increasing the market
availability of ZE locomotives in California and across the country.
The Alliance stands firmly in support of California's authority as
permitted under the CAA to adopt its own requirements for locomotive
operations and emissions standards for non-new locomotives and engines,
as well as the authority of other states and territories to voluntarily
adopt those regulations.\1\ Such regulations can play a vital role in
states' ability to improve air quality, protect public health, advance
environmental justice, and tackle climate change. California's
authorization request meets the conditions required by the law, and the
state's promulgation of IULR is consistent with the requirements of the
CAA. We support full approval of the authorization request without
delay.
Thank you again for the opportunity to comment and for the
Administration's collaboration with states and territories to confront
the climate crisis.
Sincerely,
Casey Katims,
Executive Director, U.S. Climate Alliance.

Letter of July 9, 2024, to Hon. Troy E. Nehls, Chairman, and Hon.
Frederica S. Wilson, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Railroads,
Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials, from Kristen Swearingen, Vice
President, Legislative and Political Affairs, Associated Builders and
Contractors, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Troy E. Nehls
July 9, 2024.
The Honorable Troy Nehls,
Chairman,
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Subcommittee on
Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials, U.S. House of
Representatives,
Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Frederica Wilson,
Ranking Member,
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Subcommittee on
Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials, U.S. House of
Representatives,
Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Wilson and Members of the House
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on
Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials:
On behalf of Associated Builders and Contractors, a national
construction industry trade association with 67 chapters representing
more than 23,000 members, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on
today's hearing, ``An Examination of the California Air Resources
Board's (CARB) In Use Locomotive Regulation.''
On Nov. 7, 2023, the California Air Resources Board requested that
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency authorize its In-Use
Locomotive Regulation pursuant to section 209(e) of the Clean Air Act.
This regulation would ban all locomotives 23 years or older from
operating within California and mandate zero-emissions locomotives by
2030.
To date, no commercially viable, zero-emission locomotives exist
that would comply with CARB's rule, imposing unfeasible restrictions
that could have a devastating impact on the construction industry.
EPA's authorization of the CARB rule would impose enormous compliance
costs and likely have national impacts on the railway system, creating
new logistical challenges for a key part of the supply chain. This
could potentially lead to significantly increased construction
materials prices, which are already 41% higher [https://www.abc.org/
News-Media/News-Releases/abc-construction-materials-prices-decrease-in-
may-for-the-first-time-since-december] than they were at the start of
the pandemic.
While ABC joined a wide range of industry stakeholders in
submitting comments [https://www.abc.org/
LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=MycJTZ0Xvjk%3d&portalid=1&
language=en-US] urging the EPA to deny this request, it is critical
that the EPA understands the significant risks associated with
authorizing this rule, including closure of short-line operators unable
to afford compliance, soaring supply chain costs and delays to critical
infrastructure projects.
While ABC recognizes the importance of maintaining environmental
safeguards, CARB's regulatory overreach threatens America's contractors
that work to deliver construction projects on time and on budget. ABC
appreciates the subcommittee's efforts to investigate this harmful
rule. Our members stand ready to build and maintain America's
infrastructure without undue regulatory burdens.
Sincerely,
Kristen Swearingen,
Vice President, Legislative & Political Affairs,
Associated Builders and Contractors.

Letter of July 8, 2024, to Hon. Troy E. Nehls, Chairman, and Hon.
Frederica S. Wilson, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Railroads,
Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials, from Ryan Bowley, Vice President,
Government Affairs, The Fertilizer Institute, Submitted for the Record
by Hon. Troy E. Nehls
July 8, 2024.
The Honorable Troy Nehls,
Chairman,
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials, Committee
on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of
Representatives, 2029 Rayburn House Office Building,
Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Frederica Wilson,
Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials, Committee
on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S. House of
Representatives, 589 Ford House Office Building, Washington, DC
20515.
Dear Chairman Nehls & Ranking Member Wilson:
Over sixty percent of fertilizer moves by rail year-round in the
United States, making an efficient rail system essential to ensuring
that fertilizers are available to U.S. farmers during key application
windows. In many cases, rail is the only way to transport fertilizer
products long distances, and as a single rail tank car is the
equivalent to four tank trucks, rail is often the most efficient and
safest way to ship fertilizers.
The fertilizer industry is also committed to environmental
stewardship, with many companies at the forefront of increasing energy
efficiency and working towards decarbonizing manufacturing sites to
increase the sustainability of fertilizers while ensuring agricultural
productivity.
With these factors in mind, we are concerned about the impacts from
the California Air Resources Board (CARB) In-Use Locomotive Regulation
on freight rail operations and the ability of our member companies to
meet the needs of their customers--America's farmers--who depend upon
timely delivery of these critical plant nutrients. As you know, the
CARB rule would ban most locomotives more than 23 years old beginning
in 2030 and require a switch to zero emissions equipment for new line-
haul locomotives beginning in 2025. This mandate from CARB was
established despite the reality that zero emissions locomotive
technology is not commercially available today.
As noted by the Association of American Railroads in its recent
comments to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Regulation
``would effectively ban the operation in California of locomotives more
than 23 years old . . . if CARB's regulation is authorized, more than
\2/3\ of the locomotive fleet could not enter California.'' Such an
artificial limitation of railroad capacity would cause significant
disruption to the operations of the rail carriers serving the West
Coast, with ripple effects across the country impacting fertilizer
deliveries and shipments of farm products after harvest. This risks
additional food price inflation impacting American consumers.
The likely impacts of CARB's rule on the agriculture sector were
highlighted in a recent article from agricultural economists published
by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\1\ The article, which
is enclosed with this letter, focuses on the importance of ``efficient
and cost-effective rail transportation to move agricultural commodities
to West Coast ports'' for the nearly $100 billion in agricultural and
food exports from the Midwest. As noted by the authors, ``the potential
economic implications [from CARB's In-Use Locomotive Regulation] . . .
could be significant.''

California's New Locomotive Regulation Could Impact Midwest
Agriculture.'' farmdoc daily (14): 121, Department of Agricultural and
Consumer Economics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, June
28, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
These impacts include ``elevated shipping costs [that] diminish the
competitiveness of U.S. agricultural products'' and ``logistical
inefficiencies [that] can restrict access to vital markets and decrease
market share.'' The authors go on to note that California's rules have
the potential to be adopted by other states, ``possibly impacting other
rail transportation routes to key markets and ports, such as those in
the Pacific Northwest.'' While the article focuses on farm and food
products, it's conclusions reinforce TFI's concern that CARB's rule
will impact the fertilizer industry directly through increased costs
and greater challenges in transporting products to farmers and
indirectly as those farmer customers similarly face additional economic
and operational challenges in transporting their goods to markets.
In a previous letter to EPA regarding the Regulation, TFI and
others across the agriculture industry further noted that CARB's
regulation ``would require railroads and rail customers to meet
regulatory goals that cannot be reached . . . zero emissions
locomotives would have to be purchased . . . but such locomotives are
not yet commercially viable and won't be in the foreseeable future.''
\2\ Additionally, the Regulation's ``Spending Account'' provisions risk
creating disruptive financial burdens to short line railroads who often
provide critical service to farm communities and customers.

interstate commerce impacts of CARB's rule, the Surface Transportation
Board, rightly noted its ``potentially highly significant impact . . .
on interstate rail transportation,'' in some cases ``directly managing
or governing rail transportation.'' \3\ The significant impacts of
CARB's action--impacts that will be felt by rail customers and

scrutiny.

Statement of Ian N. Jefferies, President and Chief Executive Officer,
Association of American Railroads, Submitted for the Record by Hon.
Troy E. Nehls
Introduction
On behalf of the members of the Association of American Railroads
(AAR), thank you for the opportunity to submit this statement for the
record about the California Air Resources Board's (CARB) regulation on
emissions from in-use locomotives.
At the outset, let me be clear that the rail industry shares the
goal of CARB, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and members of
Congress to improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions related to rail transportation. Railroads know that, as
cumulative global emissions continue to rise, emissions reductions and
policies aimed at transitioning toward a net-zero economy are
desirable.
Those policies, though, must be realistic, lawful, and reasonable
from a cost-benefit standpoint. The policies cannot assume that
technology that does not exist can simply be willed into existence. And
the policies must not unduly impair the efficient functioning of the
national freight rail network. Unfortunately, as explained below,
CARB's regulation fails on all these fronts, which is why the EPA
should deny the authorization necessary for it to take effect.
Railroads Are Crucial for Economic and Environmental Progress
Freight railroads play an outsized role in keeping our economy
moving. They serve our industrial and agricultural economies by moving
enormous quantities of raw materials and finished goods to and from
production areas. Without railroads, international trade as we know if
could not exist: railroads connect our farmers, mining operations, and
manufacturers with both domestic markets and markets in Canada, Mexico,
and overseas. Millions of Americans work in industries that are more
competitive in the tough global economy thanks to the affordability and
productivity of America's freight railroads. Railroads also make it
possible for retailers to fill their shelves with the products we want
to buy. In short, it is virtually impossible to overstate freight
railroads' contribution to our economic well-being, standard of living,
and quality of life.
Railroads are already an environmentally preferred way to move
freight. On average, railroads move a ton of freight nearly 500 miles
on one gallon of fuel. Railroads are three to four times more fuel
efficient than trucks, and a single train can replace several hundred
trucks on our already congested highways. Railroads account for
approximately 40 percent of U.S. long-distance freight volume (measured
by ton-miles) but account for just 1.8 percent of total U.S.
transportation-related GHG emissions and just 0.6 percent of total U.S.
GHG emissions.
Railroads, though, are not satisfied with the status quo: they are
continually seeking out further emissions reductions, both voluntarily
and as the result of cooperative partnerships with local and state
regulators. They have invested in zero-emission support infrastructure,
expanded the use of biofuels to reduce their carbon footprint, and
integrated new technologies to minimize fuel consumption, further
reducing emissions.
AAR's members have also been working with locomotive manufacturers
to develop and test low- and zero-emission battery-powered locomotives,
and several railroads are also investigating the potential of hydrogen
fuel-cell locomotives. However, these locomotives are still firmly at
the development and testing stage and are nowhere near commercial
viability.
What CARB's Regulation Entails
CARB's regulation, if authorized, would prohibit railroads,
beginning in 2030, from operating locomotives in California that are
more than 23 years beyond their original manufacture date. This means
locomotives originally built in 2007 or earlier would effectively be
banned in California. The regulation also states that, beginning in
2030 for industrial, switch, and passenger locomotives and 2035 for
line-haul locomotives, newly purchased locomotives operated in
California must be zero-emission.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Generally speaking, switch locomotives are lower horsepower
units used primarily to move railcars in rail yards and short distances
outside rail yards. Line-haul locomotives are generally higher
horsepower units used predominantly on mainline tracks for long-
distance movements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of the approximately 23,000 locomotives in the U.S. Class I
railroad locomotive fleet today, more than 15,000--nearly two-thirds--
were built before 2007. Non-Class I railroads operate several thousand
additional locomotives. According to CARB, as of 2020, the average age
of non-Class I locomotives in California was 43 years old.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Class I railroads--there are six today--are those with 2022
revenue of at least $1.03 billion. They account for roughly 95 percent
of U.S. rail industry revenue. The more than 600 non-Class I railroads,
also called short line and regional railroads, range in size from tiny
operations handling a few carloads a month to much larger entities
operating across several states. Non-Class I railroads rarely purchase
new locomotives, but instead typically purchase used units from Class I
carriers, leasing companies, rail equipment dealers, or other non-Class
I railroads.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CARB's regulation also requires railroads to deposit funds into an
escrow account overseen by the state to be used exclusively to purchase
and test zero-emission technology. Initial estimates from BNSF and
Union Pacific, the two Class I freight railroads operating in
California, indicate the required deposit would amount to $700-$800
million per year per railroad. Non-Class I railroads too would be
required to pay up to several million dollars into this fund each
year--far exceeding what some could absorb without facing insolvency.
The CARB Regulation Would Cripple Interstate Rail Traffic
A key feature of the North American rail network is its
interoperability, which underlies its efficiency and cost
effectiveness. Locomotives cross state lines and national borders
thousands of times a day, seamlessly pulling trains from one end of the
country to the other and everywhere in between. Railroads do not, and
could not, have dedicated fleets for each state. It therefore makes
little sense to speak of a ``California rail industry'' or a ``New York
rail industry'' or a ``Missouri rail industry.'' Rather, we have a
truly national, completely interconnected freight rail industry.
Indeed, a rail car or locomotive could find itself in Texas one day, in
California a week later, in Illinois a week after that, and in
Pennsylvania a week after that.
Yet CARB's regulation would force railroads to adopt such a model.
This means that if CARB's regulation were authorized, more than two-
thirds of the U.S. Class I locomotive fleet could not enter California
(and any state that replicated the CARB rule). According to data from
the Surface Transportation Board, California is sixth in the nation in
the volume of rail carloads that originate, terminate, or move through
a state--6.8 million carloads for California in 2022.\3\ Moreover,
California is home to the two largest intermodal ports in the United
States. A huge variety of imported goods arrive at these ports and move
inland by rail, while exports from throughout the country make their
way by rail to those ports for shipment overseas.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ See https://www.stb.gov/wp-content/uploads/CARSSTATE-2022.xlsx.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CARB's regulation would therefore hamstring interstate commerce.
Under the best-case scenario, locomotives would need to be switched at
the California border--assuming a compliant locomotive were available
and railyards were subsequently constructed at every intersection point
along the state borders. If no compliant locomotive were available,
freight coming into California would need to be transferred from train
to trucks. The result would be supply chain disruptions and widespread
diversions of freight from rail to trucks that are less fuel efficient
and less cost effective than railroads. Truck-caused highway damage
would also increase. Supply chains would become hopelessly snarled and
logistics costs would skyrocket.
It is not just rail track and carloads that are interconnected. At
any given moment, 5% to 10% of the line-haul locomotives operated by
Class I railroads are owned or leased by another railroad, a practice
known as ``locomotive run-through interoperability.'' As a result, it
is a regular occurrence, for example, for trains to leave Chicago for a
destination in California without a change to the locomotive(s) pulling
that train. This practice allows railroads to maximize operational
efficiency and reduces transportation time by eliminating the need to
exchange locomotives when moving from one railroad's line to another's.
Therefore, CARB's regulation of emissions from locomotives ``that
operate in California'' is tantamount to the nationwide regulation of
locomotive emissions.
The regulation would force railroads to set aside massive funds
each year to support a premature transition to zero-emission
technology. Forcing railroads to set aside this level of funding will
almost certainly increase the cost of rail service in California and
elsewhere, ultimately driving up prices for consumers and pushing more
rail traffic to trucks. For many small railroads, the required set
aside will lead to their insolvency. A policy that leads to such an
outcome cannot possibly be considered sound.
Finally, if EPA were to authorize CARB's regulation, California
would be the first state to adopt these standards, but not the only
one. Other states are given the authority to adopt an identical
regulation to California's if EPA does grant that authorization.
Comparing this regulation to equivalent ones on passenger vehicles and
the trucking sector, it is probable that anywhere from a dozen to
eighteen other states could chose to adopt California's regulation into
their own state laws. This would further degrade the interoperability
of the network and compound the financial obligations of the spending
account provision as the regulation spreads across the country.
The CARB Regulation Violates Federal Law
Congress has provided neither CARB nor EPA the authority to mandate
the rapid and technologically infeasible decarbonization of the rail
industry. Moreover, Congress has long recognized that if the rail
network is going to function safely and efficiently while meeting the
economic needs of the nation, railroads cannot be subject to a
patchwork of different state and local regulations across the country.
In addition to violating the Clean Air Act's prohibition on states
regulating emissions from new locomotives, CARB's regulation violates
the ICC Termination Act (ICCTA) of 1995 because it runs afoul of
ICCTA's federal preemption provisions. Policymakers have long
recognized that the integrated nature of the industry is crucial to its
success. For example, in 1970, Congress found that the railroad
industry `` . . . has a truly interstate character calling for a
uniform body of regulation and enforcement . . . The integral operating
parts of these companies cross many State lines. In addition to the
obvious areas of rolling stock and employees, such elements as
operating rules, signal systems, power supply systems, and
communication systems of a single company normally cross numerous State
lines. To subject a carrier to enforcement before a number of different
State administrative and judicial systems in several areas of operation
could well result in an undue burden on interstate commerce.'' \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ H.R. Report No. 91-1194, 1970.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congress adopted this same sound reasoning when it passed ICCTA.
Congress recognized that the federal government should retain exclusive
control over the regulation of railroad operations due to the inherent
interstate nature of freight railroading. Specifically, ICCTA grants
the Surface Transportation Board (STB) exclusive jurisdiction over
``transportation by rail carriers, and the remedies provided . . . with
respect to rates, classifications, rules . . . practices, routes,
services, and facilities of such carriers.'' Under ICCTA,
``transportation'' refers to ``a locomotive, car, vehicle, vessel,
warehouse, wharf, pier, dock, yard, property, facility,
instrumentality, or equipment of any kind related to the movement of
passengers or property, or both, by rail'' and ``services related to
that movement.''
Courts have held that ICCTA plainly preempts local environmental
regulations targeting railroads, such as rules imposing reporting
requirements related to emissions and restricting the idling time
allowed for locomotives. Indeed, CARB itself has acknowledged that
attempts to regulate the rail industry were preempted by federal law.
By specifically targeting the rail industry, CARB's rule violates
ICCTA's preemption sections. The rule's spread would create an
unworkable, fragmented patchwork of state regulations for locomotive
emissions that would cause far more problems and entail far more costs
than other, better alternatives that could be pursued instead.
Commercially Viable Zero-Emission Freight Locomotives Do Not Exist
In recent years, the rail industry and their suppliers have made
significant investments in developing and testing prototype battery
electric and hydrogen fuel cell locomotives. Significant progress has
been made and much promising work continues.
That said, given the current stage of development of zero-emission
locomotive technologies, compliance with the time frames found in this
regulation is not feasible. Today, zero-emission locomotives are still
in the early testing phase of development and are not close to
widespread commercial viability. The premature retirement of older
locomotives, without availability of zero-emission replacements, simply
makes no sense.
CARB's regulation goes also goes beyond what the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) believes to be technologically feasible. In its Fiscal
Year 2025 Budget Request, DOE requested $35 million to, among other
items, demonstrate a 50% reduction in GHG emissions in a locomotive
engine by 2030.\5\ This stands in stark contrast to the portion of
CARB's regulation which would require all new locomotives purchased for
use in California to be fully zero-emissions beginning in 2030.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to the lengthy timelines needed to commercialize zero-
emission locomotives, railroads would also need to build out a national
network to supply power to these new locomotives. No matter the power
source, new infrastructure will require permits and environmental
reviews, which would take years even in a best-case scenario. It would
be impossible to meet either the 2030 or 2035 timelines established in
the regulation, even if an adequate number of theoretical zero-emission
line-haul locomotives actually existed.
CARB itself does not suggest that zero-emission locomotives are
available now or will be by 2030. Rather, CARB says only that zero-
emission technology might be possible at some point. CARB fails to
consider if the technology will be safe, reliable, maintainable, or
operable on the North American rail network. CARB's regulation relied
on flawed literature and interviews with non-rail personnel who lack
the requisite knowledge needed on this topic.
Conclusion
In the past, railroads and CARB have worked collaboratively to
drive significant reductions in emissions. These initiatives have
helped pave the way for more sustainable rail operations across the
nation. It is deeply unfortunate that CARB has decided to forego the
proven path of collaboration in favor of flawed assumptions,
regulations that lack legal authority, and a casual and willful
disregard for technological realities. While the spirit behind CARB's
regulation is consistent with the rail industry's environmental
commitment, the regulation itself is unworkable and infeasible. EPA
should therefore deny the authorization needed for CARB's regulation to
be enforced.

Re:  CARB's Clean Air Act Authorization Request (EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0574)

Dear Administrator Regan:
We urge you to deny the California Air Resources Board's (CARB)
application to exempt its In-Use Locomotive Regulation (Regulation)
from the Clean Air Act.
The overreach of the CARB Regulation is stunning. It would mandate
zero-emissions locomotives in some cases by 2030 and across-the-board
by 2035, even though the technologies necessary to achieve these
reductions do not exist.
Despite moving 40% of the nation's long-distance freight by ton-
mile, the sector accounts for only 0.6% of U.S. GHG emissions.
Moreover, railroads are an essential freight transportation option for
American businesses--including those in manufacturing, agriculture,
retail, and energy production--in which scale of operations is critical
to competing in the global market.
Allowing the Regulation to move forward would cause enormous and
destructive impacts to America's supply chains and economy, and likely
increase greenhouse gas emissions.

California Regulation Would Be National Regulation. A
very large portion of the locomotive fleet moves through the state of
California each year, so railroads operating as far away as Montana,
Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and even Maine and Florida would be
forced to comply with California's standard.

The CARB Regulation Threatens the U.S. Supply Chain.
Railroads are developing new technologies to reduce emissions, but
there are no viable, zero-emission locomotives that could be deployed
at scale to meet the demands of the CARB Regulation. Without proven
technology in place, the logistical challenges of complying with this
Regulation would be enormous and complicate critical supply chains for
energy products, food, intermodal deliveries, and service to America's
ports.

Freight Would Be Forced from Rail to Roads. It is hard to
envision a scenario whereby trains would stop at the California border
to change locomotives without significant impact on national supply
chains, making diversion of freight off the rail network the most
likely outcome.

The CARB Regulation Would Drive Short Line Railroads Out
of Business. In California alone, short lines handle more than 260,000
carloads per year. Nationally, short line railroads handle 20 percent
of rail cars at origin and destination, serving virtually every
industry. Short lines do not have the capacity to replace their entire
locomotive fleets to comply with the deadlines.

The CARB Regulation Would Harm the Largest Railroads and
their Customers. Estimates suggest that Class I railroads would be
required to deposit as much as $800 million per year, per railroad, for
compliance with spending account provisions of the proposal. This
capital drain could force major infrastructure improvements to be
shelved, including those designed to reduce operations emissions and
improve safety. Moreover, Union Pacific recently estimated that a fleet
renewal as stipulated by the CARB Regulation would lead to more than
$14 billion in cost increases passed on to consumers.

Ultimately, the CARB Regulation would undermine efficiency and
dramatically slow commerce, thereby undermining the integrity of the
integrated supply chain and the reliability of railroads to meet
demand. Ironically, it would also harm ongoing efforts to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions in the freight rail industry. We urge you to
reject CARB's application.

Subject:  Opposition to the California Air Resources Board In-Use
Locomotive Regulation

Administrator Regan,
We, the undersigned individuals, and representatives of state
public policy organizations, write to you today to express our strong
opposition to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) rule targeting
the freight rail industry. We believe this CARB rule, now under review
by your agency as it pursues a waiver, poses significant threats to the
engines of our economy and the broader supply chain. State economies
could be particularly affected, as well as infrastructure and supply
chains that vary by location.
The CARB rule suffers from several critical and fatal flaws.
Namely, it unfairly burdens the freight rail industry and their
customers without acknowledging the limitations of current
technologies. The rule fails to consider the ongoing challenges and
complexities faced by the industry to convert or eliminate locomotives
when the feasibility, practicality, and technology do not exist. CARB's
lack of meaningful consultation and dialogue with key stakeholders,
including railroads, shippers, and stakeholders, is evident with the
drafting and implementation of this arbitrary and misguided rule.
Furthermore, the CARB rule significantly underestimates its
potential negative impact on commerce and consumers. By unfairly and
unjustly targeting the freight rail industry, this regulation is likely
to inflate costs for businesses and shippers that rely on rail
transportation. These increased costs will inevitably translate to
higher prices for American consumers who are already burdened with
record inflation.
Diesel locomotives are critical components of the nation's
transportation network and should be celebrated as an environmental
success story. They facilitate the safe and efficient movement of
essential commodities, goods, and products, from agriculture to
automobiles. In fact, the freight rail industry has invested billions
of dollars to modernize and upgrade their fleet to reduce emissions
through voluntary initiatives, resulting in substantial reductions in
emissions. The proposed CARB rule, with its additional regulatory
burdens, could be counterproductive to this effort.
In addition to the economic and environmental concerns outlined
above, the CARB rule threatens to disrupt the efficiency and flow of
the entire nation's supply chain. This could lead to increased delivery
delays and disruptions, inefficiencies, and inequities across state
lines, and impede industry-leading technological innovations and
investment.
Critically for this group of signers, if the EPA rubber stamps this
rule, it could effectively set a precedent that allows one state to
unilaterally dictate environmental and transportation policy for the
other 49 states. One state should not be empowered--explicitly or
implicitly--to dictate policy for the rest of the country. This is the
opposite of federalism.
We believe that environmental protection should be balanced with
the need for a robust and resilient transportation system that supports
economic growth and future prosperity. This CARB rule, as it stands,
tilts the scales dangerously out of balance as it cripples one of our
nation's economic engines.
We urge the EPA to unequivocally reject the proposed CARB rule and
safeguard the interests of our citizens, our commerce, and our
communities.
Thank you for your time and consideration of our comments.

Re:  Opposition to the California Air Resources Board In-Use Locomotive
Regulation Docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0574

We, the undersigned individuals and representatives of national
organizations and think tanks representing millions of taxpayers and
consumers, write to express our strong opposition to the California Air
Resources Board (CARB) rule regarding diesel locomotives. As advocates
for accountable and responsible governance, economic opportunity and
prosperity, consumer welfare, and taxpayer protection, we believe that
this regulation sets a dangerous precedent for American commerce and
consumers. This will have negative consequences that are not restricted
to California. Therefore, we urge the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) to reject the Clean Air Act (CAA) waiver request.
CARB's recent mandate for diesel locomotives, as reported in
various media outlets including National Review, The Wall Street
Journal, and Washington Examiner, is deeply concerning. The new rule
would put in place emissions standards that are both unreasonable and
unworkable. CARB's unilateral imposition of unachievable and
unrealistic technological requirements on locomotive manufacturers
threatens to disrupt vital supply chains and transportation links on
which American consumers and industry rely. Their rule will exacerbate
delays and disruptions and increase inflationary pressures.
CARB's failure to engage productively with the industry or their
millions of customers during the drafting of this onerous mandate
demonstrates that the rule prioritizes politics over practical public
policy. A lack of industry dialogue has highlighted the infeasibility
of CARB's proposed rule due to significant resource and technological
challenges.
Freight rail locomotives play a crucial role in hauling commercial
cargo and industrial products across vast distances efficiently and
safely. American freight railroads are recognized as the cleanest and
safest means of long-haul transportation in the nation. Yet, CARB
continues to target the rail industry with unparalleled regulations.
The primary concern with CARB's rule is its imposition of deadlines
and standards that exceed current technological capabilities. Reputable
institutions, such as the Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure,
the Competitive Enterprise Institute, The Heritage Foundation, and the
Washington Legal Foundation, have emphasized the technological
infeasibility of CARB's emission mandate. Such unrealistic requirements
place an excessive burden on manufacturers, railroads, and suppliers.
This will hinder economic growth, stifle supply chains, and threaten
innovation and investment.
Additionally, the CARB regulation mandates railroads deposit
significant funds into a California-created and California-managed
account. This diverts crucial resources away from capacity
enhancements, infrastructure upgrades, safety and service projects, and
technology improvements. Redirecting as much as 20 percent of annual
investments into one account threatens the ability of railroads to
invest in their future, especially when it comes to equipment, service,
and the workforce.
Furthermore, approving this California rule would set a troubling
precedent of federal acquiescence to state overreach. Allowing
individual states to dictate nationwide standards undermines regulatory
consistency and creates a patchwork of conflicting regulations that
will only serve to hinder interstate commerce in freight rail, an
already over-regulated industry. Unelected bureaucrats and regulators
in California should not be able to dictate national supply chain
standards or transportation policy for the rest of the nation.
Ultimately, the negative impact of this CARB rule on commerce and
consumers cannot be overstated. It will drive up labor, production,
shipping, and supply chain costs. This will create higher prices for
goods and services for consumers of goods reliant on rail
transportation. At a time when the federal government is focused on
driving down inflation, this is the last thing the administration
should consider or approve.
We urge the agency to reject CARB's request for a CAA waiver, and
instead advocate for a more balanced, collaborative, and scientific
approach. Protecting communities and the environment need not require
burdensome regulation. Rather, a sensible approach would engage
industry stakeholders, foster economic growth, promote innovation, and
protect taxpayers and consumers.
Thank you for your consideration of this critical issue.

Re:  Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0574

Dear Mr. Administrator,
The Private Railcar Food and Beverage Association, American Forest
and Paper Association, Consumer Brands Association, Freight Rail
Customer Alliance, National Coal Transportation Association, National
Industrial Transportation League, and Western Coal Traffic League
(otherwise referred to as ``Joint Associations''), is pleased to submit
these comments on the California Air Resources Board's (CARB) request
for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authorization of its In-
Use Locomotive Regulation (Regulation) in the above-referenced docket.
We urge EPA to deny CARB's request. As major transportation
stakeholders and some of the largest users of freight rail, Joint
Associations' members are extremely concerned that the rule is both
technically and economically infeasible, and therefore inconsistent
with Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements. In addition, the Regulation is
clearly preempted by the ICC Termination Act, 49 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.
10101 et seq (ICCTA) as the Regulation would greatly interfere with
rail transportation.
The Private Railcar Food and Beverage Association (PRFBA) is
comprised of 16 global food and beverage companies and manufacturers,
headquartered in North America. These members include Frito-Lay
(PepsiCo), Molson Coors Beverage Company, KraftHeinz Food Company,
General Mills, Inc., McCain Foods USA, Inc., Nortera Foods/Bonduelle
Americas, Tropicana Brands Group, Boardman Foods, Inc., G3 Enterprises,
Inc., JD Irving/Cavendish Farms, Simplot, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.,
Univar Solutions, Land O' Lakes, Inc., National Sugar Marketing, LLC,
and Leprino Foods. All are major rail shippers that rely on the
railroads to produce and distribute their food and beverage products
that are vital to the health and welfare of our nation and essential to
feeding its citizens. Without adequate rail service, their food and
beverages will not be on American store shelves.
Moreover, PRFBA members all own or lease railcars. As such, they
absorb costs associated with equipment ownership, operation, and
maintenance. This regulation would greatly affect the ability to fully
utilize PRFBA members' rail cars. If there is a shortage of
locomotives, this would result in ``parking'' these railcar assets
which is seldom a wise financial decision. PRFBA members invest
millions of dollars in rail cars.
The American Forest and Paper Association (AF&PA) is comprised of
small, medium and large companies in rural and urban communities across
the country making roughly 87% of the pulp, paper, paper-based
packaging and tissue products made in the United States.
The Consumer Brands Association (CBA) champions the industry that
makes the products you choose and the brands you trust. From household
and personal care to food and beverage products, the consumer packaged
goods industry plays a vital role in powering the U.S. economy,
contributing $2 trillion to U.S. GDP and supporting more than 20
million American jobs.
The Freight Rail Customer Alliance (FRCA) is an umbrella membership
organization that includes large trade associations representing more
than 3,500 electric utility, agriculture, chemical, and alternative
fuel companies, and their consumers. The mission of FRCA's growing
coalition of industries and associations is to obtain changes in
Federal law and policy that will provide all freight shippers with
reliable rail service at competitive prices.
The National Coal Transportation Association (NCTA), is a non-
profit corporation comprised of electric utilities, coal producers,
shippers of coal-related commodities, and entities that produce,
repair, and manage all facets of railcar component parts and systems,
as well as provide services for railcar operations. Its primary purpose
is to promote the exchange of ideas, knowledge, and technology
associated with the transportation and beneficial uses of coal.
Founded in 1907, the National Industrial Transportation League
(NITL) , has been a trade association representing The Voice of the
Shipper across truck, rail, intermodal, ocean, and barge. NITL members
represent a wide variety of commodities and businesses, who rely on
efficient, competitive, and safe marine, rail, and highway
transportation systems within the United States and beyond to meet
their supply chain requirements and the needs of their customers.
NITL's shipper members include those who move consumer goods,
manufacturers, agriculture, chemicals, steel, forest products, fuels,
food and more. NITL's 200 members spend billions on freight dollars
annually and employ millions of people.
The Western Coal Traffic League (WCTL) was founded in 1977. It is
comprised of consumers of coal products produced from United States
mines located west of the Mississippi River.
The CARB rule would ban most locomotives more than 23 years old
starting in 2030. It would require new passenger, switch, and
industrial locomotives to be zero emissions beginning in 2030 and
require new line-haul locomotives to be zero emissions beginning in
2035. However, no commercially viable technology exists today for zero
emission locomotives for line haul service.
The CARB rule would require dramatic advances in locomotive
technology. It would also require sweeping upgrades to the nation's
electrical transmission system and interconnection permitting process
that we believe are infeasible by the implementation deadlines. These
issues raise serious concerns that the CARB regulation violates the
CAA. As discussed in EPA's February 27, 2024, Federal Register Notice
(89 FR 14484), EPA has previously held that state standards and
enforcement procedures are inconsistent with section 202(a) of the CAA
if ``there is inadequate lead time to permit the development of the
necessary technology, giving appropriate consideration of the cost of
compliance within that time.'' Following the precedent of these
previous decisions, EPA should deny authorization of the CARB
requirements.
The Joint Associations strongly support a uniform federal
regulatory framework for the nation's freight rail network. Allowing
California and other states to adopt unique rules governing locomotives
would be contrary to the ICC Termination Act of 1995, which largely
preempts local or state laws that have a regulatory impact on
railroads. If the CARB regulations were authorized by EPA, we believe
freight rail carriers and their rail customers, including the
respective members of the Joint Associations, would be significantly
hindered financially and operationally. The inevitable increases in
transportation costs and introduction of operational inefficiencies for
shippers and receivers, especially for those who are rail-dependent or
captive, would also result in further inflation. For these and other
reasons, we believe there is substantial merit to the claims by the
Association of American Railroads and the American Short Line and
Regional Rail Association in their pending legal challenge of the rules
in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California that
all or a significant part of CARB's regulations are preempted by 49
U.S.C. Sec. 10501(b), which gives the Surface Transportation Board
(``STB'') exclusive jurisdiction over the operations and other
activities of freight railroads in interstate commerce, and as written
preempts all state and federal laws that are in conflict. The District
Court affirmed the legitimacy of the railroads' preemption arguments in
an order issued February 16, 2024.
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Court) in Ass'n of Am. R.Rs. v.
S. Coast Air Quality Mgmt. Dist. (AAR), 622 F.3d 1094 (2010), has
already held that idling rules and related reporting requirements that
``apply exclusively and directly to railroad activity'' were
``plainly'' preempted by the ICCTA. 622 F.3d at 1098. The Court
explained that the ICCTA and STB precedent preserve a potential role
for state and local environmental regulators, but it is limited: (1)
state and local agencies may promulgate ``EPA-approved statewide
plans'' under the CAA, which are sometimes ``possible to harmonize with
ICCTA,'' or (2) state and local regulators may ``enforce their
generally applicable regulations in a way that does not unreasonably
burden railroad activity.'' Id. Here, no ``EPA-approved'' Statewide
Implementation Plan is at issue. The provisions of the ``In-Use
Locomotive Regulation,'' Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, Sec.  2478 (emphasis
added), are not ``generally applicable regulations,'' AAR, 622 F.3d at
1098. Thus, under AAR, categorical preemption cannot be avoided merely
because the Regulation is intended to address air pollution. As in AAR,
the provisions here apply ``exclusively and directly to railroad
activity'' and ``have the effect of managing or governing rail
transportation.'' 622 F.3d at 1098 (quotation marks omitted); see also
Delaware v. STB, 859 F.3d 16, 22 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Del.) (upholding the
STB's determination that locomotive idling rules were categorically
preempted because the law directly and exclusively ``regulates rail
transportation by prohibiting locomotives from idling in certain places
at certain times'').
In applying ICCTA categorical preemption, courts ask if the
specific ``statutes or regulations'' at issue target railroad
operations. Del., 859 F.3d at 19, 22. Thus, in AAR, the Court held that
``rules'' imposing idling and reporting requirements ``plainly'' were
not of ``general applicability,'' 622 F.3d at 1098, even though the
South Coast ``regulated numerous sources of pollution'' other than
locomotives.
The ICCTA preempts state laws ``with respect to the regulation of
rail transportation,'' 49 U.S.C. Sec.  10501(b)(2) (emphasis added),
and courts have reasoned that when laws of general applicability are
enforced against railroads--e.g., ``standard building, fire, and
electrical codes''--the incidental impact on railroads is different
than direct regulation. But there is nothing remote or incidental about
the Regulation's effect on rail transportation. The provisions at issue
apply ``exclusively and directly to railroad activity'' and govern how
railroad operators must engage in railroad transportation in
California. AAR, 622 F.3d at 1098.
Allowing this Regulation would subvert the ICCTA's core objective
of ``national uniformity in laws governing rail transportation.'' The
STB has explained that non-federal rules regulating locomotive idling
and imposing reporting obligations would ``directly interfere'' with
the purpose of the ICCTA by subjecting railroads ``to fluctuating rules
as they cross state lines.'' U.S. EPA, Petition for Declaratory Order,
No. FD 35803, 2014 WL 7392860, at *6, *8 (S.T.B. Dec. 29, 2014)
(describing locomotive idling rules adopted or considered by other
states). If ICCTA categorical preemption evaporated whenever a state
imposed supposedly analogous regulations on another industry, the
railroad regulatory scheme would devolve into a balkanized system of
state-by-state regulations--precisely what Congress sought to avoid by
prioritizing ``the uniformity of Federal standards.'' H.R. Rep. No.
104-311, at 96 (1995).
In addition to the significant legal issues here, compliance costs
and supply chain reliability are at stake for rail shippers and their
customers across the country. Rail carries about 40 percent of long-
distance freight in the U.S. While this regulation is ostensibly
imposed within California, the impact of this costly and burdensome
regulation will be felt nation-wide. It is estimated that railroads
will need to deposit up to $800 million per year in a ``Spending
Account'' for purchase and testing of zero-emission equipment that does
not exist or is viable. This compliance cost alone is estimated to
increase costs to customers by $14 billion for just one Class I
railroad. These costs of course will be passed on to customers,
including those respective members of the Joint Associations.
Further, the Joint Associations are concerned that the ``Spending
Account'' provisions of the rule would impose significant financial
burdens on railroads, which may be untenable for some short line
railroads. If these carriers are unable to continue operations, it
could create additional supply chain disruptions and negatively impact
large segments of the economy, including manufacturers, farmers, and
energy producers. Short line railroads handle 20 percent of rail cars
at origin and destination and are a critical link for manufacturers and
other businesses to access the national rail network. Short line
railroads in California and railroads in other states that could
subsequently adopt the California standards cannot absorb the costs to
upgrade locomotive fleets and other compliance costs associated with
this regulation, potentially leaving customers along any routes that go
out of service without access to this mode of transportation. At worst,
investments in other critical network upgrades or projects benefiting
the environment will be diverted in order to pay for compliance with
this regulation.
In addition to the compliance costs, this standard threatens rail
reliability by forcing adoption of unproven technology to power
locomotives. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the nation has seen the mess
resulting from, and costs associated with, supply chain delays and
disruptions.
Voluntarily introducing unproven and potentially unreliable
technology into this critical portion of the transportation sector is
inviting future costly and time-wasting supply chain disruptions that
can be entirely avoided by rejecting CARB's authorization request.
The Joint Associations strongly oppose EPA granting CARB's request.
We urge EPA to carefully consider the feasibility of the CARB rule as
well as its potential impacts on freight shippers that rely on rail
service to deliver essential products throughout the nation.

for the Record by Hon. Troy E. Nehls

Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Frederica Wilson,
Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials,
Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman Nehls and Ranking Member Wilson:
Ahead of the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials
Subcommittee's July 9th Hearing entitled ``An Examination of the
California Air Resources Board's (CARB) In Use Locomotive Regulation''
we write on behalf of the members of the National Stone, Sand & Gravel
Association (NSSGA) and California Construction and Industrial
Materials Association (CalCIMA), to express our concerns over the
California Air Resources Board's (CARB) request for EPA authorization
of its In-Use Locomotive Regulation.
The CARB rule would ban most locomotives that are more than 23
years old starting in 2030. It would require new passenger, switch, and
industrial locomotives to have zero-emissions beginning in 2030 and new
line-haul locomotives to have zero-emissions beginning in 2035.
However, no commercially viable technology exists today for zero-
emission locomotives for line haul service, making the petition
unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious. We are concerned that the rule
is technically and economically infeasible, and therefore inconsistent
with the Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements. We urge EPA to deny CARB's
request.
Our organizations represent aggregates producers and those who
manufacture equipment and services that support the construction
industry. Our members are essential to the work of this country. Our
members employ thousands of hard-working men and women, who are
responsible for the essential raw materials found in every home,
building, road, port, dam and public works project.
The CARB rule would require dramatic advances in locomotive
technology. It would also require sweeping upgrades to the nation's
electrical transmission system and interconnection permitting process
that we believe is infeasible by the implementation deadlines.
California lacks statutory authority for each of these endeavors.
These issues raise serious concerns that the CARB regulation
violates the CAA. As discussed in EPA's Feb. 27, 2024, Federal Register
Notice (89 FR 14484), EPA has previously held that state standards and
enforcement procedures are inconsistent with section 202(a) of the CAA
if ``there is inadequate lead time to permit the development of the
necessary technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of
compliance within that time.'' Following the precedent of these
previous decisions, EPA should deny authorization of the CARB
requirements.
We are further concerned that the ``Spending Account'' provisions
of the rule would impose significant financial burdens on railroads,
which may be untenable for some short-line railroads who are often the
first mile and last mile for critical commodities and have significant
Impacts the interstate commerce they enable including critical
infrastructure and essential consumer goods. If these carriers are
unable to continue operations, it could create additional supply chain
disruptions and negatively impact large segments of the economy,
including construction materials producers. manufacturers, farmers, and
energy producers.
We strongly support a uniform federal regulatory framework for the
nation's freight rail network. Allowing California and other states to
adopt unique rules governing locomotives would be contrary to the ICC
Termination Act of 1995, which largely preempts local or state laws
that have a regulatory impact on railroads. Furthermore, it would
undermine the national framework that supports the interoperability of
rail equipment across the network, potentially harming the reliability
and efficiency of rail service for our industries.
Thank you for your consideration of our concerns. We urge EPA to
carefully consider the feasibility of the CARB rule, as well as its
potential impacts on freight shippers that rely on rail service to
deliver essential materials throughout the nation.

RE:  California State Nonroad Engine Pollution Control Standards; In-
Use Locomotive Regulation; Requests for Authorization, Docket ID No.
EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0574

Dear Director Simon:
The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (``AFPM'') asks the
Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') to deny the California Air
Resources Board's (``CARB'') request that EPA grant a waiver for CARB's
In-Use Locomotive Regulation pursuant to section 209(e) of the Clean
Air Act (``CAA'').\1\ As one of the largest users of freight rail, AFPM
members would be directly impacted by these technically and
economically infeasible regulations that are inconsistent with CAA
requirements. The arbitrary and capricious regulation set forth by
California threatens to dramatically slow national commerce and
undermine the integrity of the integrated supply chain and the ability
of railroads to meet demand.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ See 89 Fed. Reg. 14484 (Feb. 27, 2024), ``California State
Nonroad Engine Pollution Control Standards; In-Use Locomotive
Regulation; Requests for Authorization.'' EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0574-0001.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AFPM members make the fuels and petrochemicals that make modern
life possible and keep America moving. To produce these essential goods
and bring them to market, AFPM members depend on safe and efficient
rail transportation to move their feedstocks and products to and from
refineries and petrochemical facilities. More than two and half million
carloads of fuel and petrochemical feedstocks and products move by rail
every year.
AFPM members are committed to environmental stewardship, and we
support technology-neutral, free market solutions that provide consumer
choice. However, AFPM opposes government electrification mandates that
create an unlevel playing field and fail to achieve cost-effective
emission reductions. We have serious concerns about the CARB petition
and the impacts an EPA approval will have on the U.S. freight rail
system and rail-dependent manufacturing sectors.
California Cannot, and Should Not, Dictate National Rail or
Environmental Policy
Congress intended that the federal government serve as the sole
regulator in this sector. Federal statutes such as section 209(e)(1) of
the Clean Air Act (``CAA'') and the ICC Termination Act (``ICCTA'') of
1995 make clear that approval of CARB's authorization request would be
inappropriate and unlawful. A significant share of the locomotive fleet
moves through California, meaning interstate and international commerce
likely would be affected if railroads are forced to abide by a unique
set of rules in California. Given the national scope and inter-
connectedness of the U.S. rail system, it is unlikely trains will
change locomotives at the California border without significant delays
and other impacts on the national supply chain. EPA should reject this
proposal that will harm supply chains by forcing transition to
technologies that do not yet exist.
As acknowledged in EPA's February 27, 2024, Federal Register Notice
(89 FR 14484), EPA has historically interpreted CAA section
209(e)(2)(A)(iii)'s ``consistency'' inquiry harmonious with other
section 209 waivers' consistency requirements, meaning that these state
standards and enforcement procedures must provide adequate ``lead time
to permit the development of the necessary technology, giving
appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within that time.''
\2\ EPA must adhere to the statute and deny California's request for a
preemption waiver, since it does not afford adequate lead time and does
not appropriately consider the cost of compliance. These costs are
ultimately born by all rail shippers and, by extension, the general
public.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further, California's request impacts the refining industry and
numerous other industries beyond rail, and raises significant grid
reliability issues and national security concerns. The U.S. does not
have adequate supplies of the critical minerals and metal needed for
the level of electrification caused by this and other CARB rules such
as the Advanced Clean Cars II (``ACC II'') regulations.\3\ The forced
electrification of the railroad industry is a major policy question
that Congress has not directly authorized. CARB's request for
authorization also raises other statutory and constitutional concerns,
including conflicts with the import-export clause, privileges and
immunities clause, full faith and credit clause, equal sovereignty
doctrine, dormant commerce clause, regulatory takings, and dormant
foreign affairs preemption doctrine.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ See ``California Air Resources Board--Advanced Clean Cars II''
All of AFPM's same concerns with ACC II apply to this rulemaking. See
generally Final Brief for Private Petitioners, Ohio v. EPA, No. 22-1081
(D.C. Cir. April 20, 2023) (incorporated herein by the reference); See
Comments Submitted by the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers
on California State Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; Advanced
Clean Cars II Regulations; Request for Waiver of Preemption;
Opportunity for Public Hearing and Public Comment, 88 Fed. Reg. 88,908
(Dec. 26, 2023), Docket ID EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0292-0060.
\4\ See U.S. Constitution Article I, Section 10, Clause 2; Article
IV, Section 2; Article IV, Section 1; Amendment 10.4.3; Amendment 5;
and Article I, Section 8, Clause 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Granting the Request Would Create Significant Supply Chain Disruptions
This regulation from CARB could significantly disrupt the supply
chain for all sectors of the U.S. economy, especially manufacturers and
shippers who rely on consistent, reliable rail service. It could lead
to delays for businesses and increased costs for both shippers and
consumers that could ultimately lead to a massive supply chain crisis.
The locomotive technology and the infrastructure needed to power it are
not available. Further, CARB's efforts to analyze these hurdles are
insufficient and fall far short of overcoming the legal standard need
to proceed.
For example, as the Rail Customer Coalition noted in their letter
to this docket, a broad cross-section of manufacturing, agricultural,
and energy industries that depend on the railroads to deliver reliable
and affordable service are set to be negatively impacted. These
industries are essential to a healthy U.S. economy, with operations and
employees throughout the country collectively providing more than 7
million jobs and producing more than $4.8 trillion in economic output.
CARB's request puts all these industries at risk.
The Request Is Not Feasible
The CARB rule would require dramatic advances in locomotive, and
related, technologies on a timeline and scale that are not feasible.
The CARB rule would ban most locomotives more than 23 years old
starting in 2030. It would also require new passenger, switch, and
industrial locomotives to be zero emissions beginning in 2030 and
require new line-haul locomotives to be zero emissions beginning in
2035. However, no commercially viable technology exists today for zero
emission locomotives for line haul service, making the request
unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious.
It would also necessitate sweeping upgrades to the nation's
electrical transmission system and interconnection permitting process
that are infeasible by the implementation deadlines. Our current grid
simply cannot support electrified locomotives in any appreciable way.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy's National Transmission
Needs Study, the national electric transmission infrastructure would
need to grow 57% by 2035 to reach the Biden Administration's clean
energy goals for light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.\5\ Yet at the
historical pace of approximately 1% annual growth for these
infrastructure projects, the transmission system could not support the
requirements of this rule. In fact, more than half a century is needed
for the Administration to achieve its stated goals for only light duty
vehicles. This challenge is exacerbated by mandates to electrify
multiple modes of transportation, coupled with permitting system that
delays much needed power, mining, and charging projects for years if
not decades.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ See Department of Energy, Grid Development Office, ``National
Transmission Needs Study''. Published October 30, 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
California lacks statutory authority for each of these endeavors.
Despite aggressive research and development and innovation in the rail
sector and significant private investments, deployment of the
technologies within the timeframe of this rule is unreasonable,
arbitrary, and capricious.
The In-Use Locomotive Regulations are Unlawful
The CAA preempts the In-Use Locomotive Regulations because they do
not qualify for a waiver under section 209(e) of the Act. Under that
provision, CARB cannot ``adopt or enforce'' these regulations until
receiving a preemption waiver from EPA. Here, CARB acted prematurely
and ``adopted'' the regulation before EPA issued a waiver. That said,
EPA cannot grant California a preemption waiver if (1) CARB's
determination regarding the In-Use Locomotive Regulations is arbitrary
and capricious, (2) California ``does not need'' these regulations to
meet ``compelling and extraordinary conditions,'' or (3) California's
standards and the accompanying enforcement procedures are not
consistent with section 209 of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. Sec.  7543.\6\ CARB
has not adequately shown these regulations are needed to address
compelling and extraordinary conditions and that they are as protective
as federal standards. CARB's failure to address issues of central
relevance to the regulation renders its determination arbitrary and
capricious.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ See 42 U.S.C. Sec.  7543(e)(2)(A)(i)-(iii).
\7\ See 40 CFR Subchapter C Part 92.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CARB failed to demonstrate it ``needs'' the In-Use Locomotive
Regulations to address ``compelling and extraordinary conditions.'' The
state's local air pollution analysis was incomplete at best, and
greenhouse gas (``GHG'') emissions, by nature, are not a local problem.
Despite generating 40% of the nation's long-distance freight by ton-
mile, the locomotive sector accounts for a minuscule 0.6% of U.S. GHG
emissions.\8\ Section 209 was designed to address distinct localized
problems, not global problems that are shared with the many other areas
in the U.S. As such, California's request to address conditions related
to global climate change cannot qualify for a section 209 waiver. Given
how small a proportion of worldwide GHG emissions are represented by
California's locomotive emissions, this regulation will have no
discernible impact on GHG emissions or impacts on California and thus
California cannot ``need'' this regulation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ See Association of American Railroads, ``Freight Railroads and
Climate Change''. March 2021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similarly, an exceedingly small portion of the California's
nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions are attributed to
trains.\9\ Therefore, this Regulation cannot ``address compelling and
extraordinary conditions'' related to criteria pollutants.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ CARB's Criteria Pollutant Emission Inventory Data (2017) (see
mobile and stationary source data). In addition, absent a true
lifecycle assessment, CARB has not quantified the claimed benefits of
this regulation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, section 209(b)(1) mandates that California determine
whether its proposed regulation is at least as protective of public
health ``and'' welfare as applicable federal standards. CARB never
conducted a full life cycle analysis of electric locomotive engines,
nor did CARB conduct a comparative analysis as to why its proposed
regulations option would accomplish public health goals more
effectively than alternative scenarios, such as evaluating without
considering alternative emissions reduction scenarios such evaluating
the public health and welfare benefits of Tier 3 and Tier 4 standards
for all locomotives.
Instead, CARB arbitrarily and capriciously concludes regulation set
forth by California threatens to dramatically slow national commerce
and undermine the integrity of the integrated supply chain at great
cost and for limited environmental benefit, if any, particularly on a
true lifecycle emissions basis. Finally, California's conditions
related to global climate change are not ``extraordinary.''
Conclusion
Thank you for your consideration of these comments. AFPM strongly
urges EPA to carefully consider the legality and feasibility of the
CARB rule as well as its potential impacts on freight shippers that
rely on rail service to deliver essential products throughout the
nation.
Sincerely,
Rob Benedict,
Vice President, Petrochemical & Midstream,

Re:  CARB's Clean Air Act Authorization Request (EPA-HQ-OAR-2023-0574)

Dear Mr. Administrator:
The undersigned groups representing agricultural producers and
agribusinesses urge you to deny a request from the California Air
Resources Board (CARB) for authorization of regulations that would
target key aspects of the operation of freight locomotives in
California. The proposed regulations would (1) levy annual fees on rail
carriers for deposit in accounts that can only be used to comply with
the regulations; (2) require the decommission of locomotives 23 years
or older beginning in 2030 and require that new switch, industrial
(used by rail customers) and passenger locomotives operate in zero-
emission configuration (2035 for new line haul locomotives); (3)
attempt to regulate locomotive emissions by requiring railroads to shut
them down while in transit in certain circumstances; and (4) impose
certain reporting and ``administrative payments.''
If the CARB regulations were authorized by EPA, we believe freight
rail carriers and their rail customers would be significantly hindered
financially and operationally. The inevitable increases in
transportation costs and introduction of operational inefficiencies for
agricultural shippers and receivers would result in food price
inflation. For these and other reasons, we believe there is substantial
merit to the claims by the Association of American Railroads and the
American Short Line and Regional Rail Association in their pending
legal challenge of the rules in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of California that all or a significant part of CARB's
regulations are preempted by 49 U.S.C. Sec. 10501(b), which gives the
Surface Transportation Board (``STB'') exclusive jurisdiction over the
operations and other activities of freight railroads in interstate
commerce, and as written preempts all state and federal laws that are
in conflict. The District Court affirmed the legitimacy of the
railroads' preemption arguments in an order issued February 16, 2024.
Moreover, the proposed rules would require railroads and rail
customers to meet regulatory goals that cannot be reached.
Specifically, zero emissions locomotives would have to be purchased to
replace the decommissioned locomotives, but such locomotives are not
yet commercially viable and won't be in the foreseeable future.
Presumably, battery technology would need to be utilized to meet
the zero-emission requirement. While battery powered locomotives have
been tested, they are not presently commercially viable primarily due
to a limited operating range.
In summary, we believe the proposed CARB regulations pose a
significant danger to U.S. agriculture and the broader U.S. supply
chain and that as written they are legally questionable. We therefore
urge you to reject the request for authorization.
Thank you for your consideration of our concerns with CARB's
request for authorization of its in-use locomotive regulation.

Questions to Dillon Olvera, President and Chief Executive Officer,
Modesto and Empire Traction Company, on behalf of the American Short
Line and Regional Railroad Association, from Hon. Troy E. Nehls

Question 1. In her testimony before the Committee, CARB Chief Arias
claimed the CARB Rule's alternative compliance plans offer an
opportunity for Class II and Class III operations to comply with the
Regulation.
Are these options a viable alternative for Class II and Class III
operations?
Answer. These options are not viable for the Modesto and Empire
Traction Company (MET). My understanding is that there are two
alternatives that are offered by CARB:
The first alternative is the Small Business Hardship Extension.
This offers a 3-year extension from the initial compliance date for
locomotive operators that fall under $5 million \1\ in annual gross
revenue. Given our current locomotive fleet and their remaining useful
lives, this alternative would need to be between a 10 to 15-year
extension to provide any benefit. During their rulemaking process, CARB
failed to understand that most short line locomotives begin their
service with our industry used, often already fifteen or more years
old, and then we will use them for very long lifespans of many decades
more. Because of this misunderstanding, the CARB requirements for
equipment lifespans and this extension option were wholly inappropriate
given the operational and economic conditions of short line railroads.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Adjusted annually for inflation by the U.S. Consumer Price
Index.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because of the capital intensity of small railroads, the CARB
revenue threshold for this option is likely to exclude many Class II
and III operators who have greater revenue but with very slim margins
typical of short line railroads. This is why the Small Business
Administration (SBA) sets the federal size standard for small business
short line railroads at 1,500 employees. For unknown reasons, CARB
chose not to utilize this SBA threshold in crafting their rule and
instead created their own revenue measure that is not appropriate given
the economics of small railroads.
The second option is the Alternative Compliance Plan. This allows
for regulated entities to receive credit towards the locomotive
requirements by reducing the targeted emissions by taking other
measures at their operations, which must occur within three miles of
their locomotive operations, in the case of PM and NOX reductions. The
MET does not possess any such assets where such a scale and type of
emissions reductions could be achieved, and I don't believe many other
Class II or Class III railroads possess such assets either.

Question 2. Businesses need to earn an adequate rate of return to
justify the time, effort, risk, and opportunity costs of operating the
business. Workers make similar judgments when looking for or changing
jobs. Do you believe the bureaucrats that draft these regulations
appreciate these realities? Do they acknowledge the inherent tradeoffs
of their policies?
Answer. In my opinion, the CARB team failed to properly consider
the economics of the small railroads that would be impacted during
their regulatory impact assessment. They did not understand the scale
of the costs their regulation would impose on small railroads, nor how
those costs would impact those businesses' viability over the medium
and long term.
Two key tradeoffs in benefits were not considered during CARB's
analysis:
First, the regulation mandates a huge increase in investments in
locomotives over historical costs that will displace years of spending
on other valuable activities at railroads like ours. For example,
investments will have to be commensurately reduced in areas like
railroad track and grade crossing protection, which would otherwise
improve safety for railroad workers and the public.
The second tradeoff not properly considered is the risk of
diversion of rail traffic to truck. Especially for the smallest short
line railroads, the cost burden imposed by the regulation--an order of
magnitude over traditional motive power fleet capital costs--could
result in line segments or even entire railroads becoming unprofitable.
This could lead to a small railroad's freight traffic being shifted to
truck, with the associated impacts in areas like road congestion and
accidents, pavement damage and higher logistics costs for shippers.
I also believe that CARB's forecasts for adoption of zero-emissions
truck technology are unrealistically aggressive. If my expectation
turns out to be true, then the tradeoff of such a modal shift would be
the impacts of a much greater emissions profile per unit of freight
transported by diesel trucks instead of rail, multiplied by each 3-4
trucks replacing each railcar in trains transporting many railcars at a
time.

Question 3. In your opinion, should issues of this scope and
magnitude be considered as agency regulations? Specifically, should
such a far-reaching regulation be subject to the Administrative
Procedure Act?
Answer. I feel strongly that this issue is wholly a federal one.
The only appropriate venue for government action on locomotive
emissions should be a formal rulemaking process carried out by the
Environmental Protection Agency. As argued in our industry's litigation
\2\ that is underway against CARB over their regulation, state action
in this area is preempted by at least three provisions of federal law:
the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act, the Clean Air Act,
and the Locomotive Inspection Act. This preemption has been repeatedly
upheld in decades of case law. Unfortunately there is a mechanism in
the CAA that facilitates avoidance of elements of the Administrative
Procedure Act that Congress intended to be applied to protect the
public interest when significant rulemakings are carried out.

docket/california/caedce/2:2023cv01154/429700

Question 3.a. Has agency use of waivers and guidance provided an
end-run around normal rulemaking procedures? Are they being used to
create loopholes in the rulemaking process?
Answer. The provisions of the Clean Air Act that enable
California's stricter-than-federal emissions regulations to be
``authorized'' by the Environmental Protection Agency, and to
subsequently be adopted by other states, in my opinion, do create a
hugely problematic loophole.
Section 209(e)(2) of the Clean Air Act \3\ establishes the
California waiver process for nonroad engines, under which CARB has
petitioned EPA for approval of their regulation. This will be the first
time this has been tried with locomotives, but a sister provision,
Section 177 of the CAA, governing road vehicle emissions, has been
utilized for many authorizations. Those regulations have been
subsequently adopted by many states, with tremendous resulting national
impacts. The scale of the California market and the CAA authorization
and state adoption process has been used repeatedly to de facto
establish national standards for emissions without having to carry out
a federal rulemaking process with associated safeguards, or to consider
the federalism implications of the action.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ 42 USC 7543(e)(2)

Question 3.b. Can you detail the consequences of allowing an agency
to circumvent the rulemaking process?
Answer. In the case of this CARB regulation, one consequence is
that an agency action that would qualify as a major rulemaking \4\
avoids the detailed scrutiny, public engagement, Congressional review
and rigorous cost-benefit analysis that would accompany a formal
rulemaking process. The impacts of the rule entering effect in
California alone would trip this threshold, were it a formal
rulemaking, and the ability for it to propagate to other states
multiplies the impact potential. Because this is not a rulemaking, the
Congressional Review Act requirements are not triggered. Among the
protections established in law by Congress that are avoided are those
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act and Small Business Regulatory
Enforcement Fairness Act. These provisions are specifically designed to
protect America's small businesses during the process of development of
major rules, such as by enabling small business advocacy review panels
between EPA, the Small Business Administration and OMB's Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). A formal rulemaking process
for a major rule also provides a more elaborate venue and extended
process facilitating the participation of other agencies in the
process. I noted that even for this informal authorization process by
EPA, both SBA and the Surface Transportation Board did each file
comments expressing serious concerns with the legal and practical
implications of federal authorization of the CARB In-Use Locomotive
Regulation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ In the case of the Congressional Review Act a rule anticipated
to have an annual effect on the economy of $100m or more, among other
criteria.

Question 4. In your testimony, you provided an example of how
Modesto Empire Traction Company had partnered with state entities to
reduce its operational emissions. Now, this same state appears to be
undoing that very same collaboration. Can you please elaborate on the
status of this collaboration?
Answer. Beginning in 2008, the MET worked closely with California
to apply for state grants. Nine of our 11 locomotives were upgraded
from Tier 0 to Tier 3 due this work. There are three different grants
in place today that have obligations that will be completed through
2032, yet the new regulation requires us to repower these locomotives
to Tier 4 by 2030. In addition, the MET still has debt tied to these
Tier 3 locomotives and made millions of dollars of our own investment
into these locomotives with the expectation that they would be
compliant in the state of California for 30-40 years after acquiring
them.
MET has applied for funding for locomotive investments from the
U.S. DOT's Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements
(CRISI) grant program. If won, this grant would support repowering the
MET's Tier 3 locomotives to Tier 4 to enable compliance with the new
CARB regulation.
In my opinion, CARB, in their development of the regulation, did
not consider the interplay of their regulation with previous public
investments made to reduce locomotive emissions. Implementation of the
regulation will result in the abandonment of these earlier
improvements, which is a waste of tax dollars. CARB has taken a
maximalist approach that fails to recognize the huge reductions in
emissions that can be and have been achieved at short line locomotive
fleets within the EPA tiers below Tier 4. The agency also failed to
understand the economic realities of short line motive power
investments. Short lines have always almost exclusively established
their fleets by acquiring used locomotives on the secondary market.
Even with public assistance, the match funding amounts alone that must
be provided by the short line for repowers or acquisitions of the
latest locomotives are still typically a multiple of the historical
average used locomotive acquisition costs for these firms and are not
achievable.

Questions to Roger Nober, Director, GW Regulatory Studies Center and
Professor of Practice at the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and
Public Administration, George Washington University, from Hon. Troy E.
Nehls

Question 1. As discussed at the hearing, in 2005 CARB entered into
a voluntary agreement with BNSF and UP to reduce emissions at rail
yards.\1\ The agreement stated: ``The parties recognize that
Participating Railroads are federally regulated and that aspects of
state and local authority to regulate railroads are preempted.'' \2\ It
further stated, ``the Federal Clean Air Act, the Interstate Commerce
Termination Act and many other laws establish a uniform federal system
of equipment and operational requirements.'' \3\ CARB acknowledged
Federal preemption in this agreement. When I asked CARB Chief Arias
``what changed'' she responded that the ``technology changed.'' \4\

In-Use Locomotive Regulation: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Transp.
and Infrastructure, 118th Cong. (July 09, 2024), (statement of Heather
Arias, Chief, Transportation and Toxics Division, California Air
Resources Board).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, preemption determinations are not based on the
availability of technology, nor do they compel adoption of new
technology under Federal law. What Federal law is CARB relying on to
support the request for authorization to supersede Federal preemptive
law?
Answer. I am not aware of any provision of the Interstate Commerce
Act, the Federal Clean Air Act or any other provision of federal law
dealing with transportation where a determination of whether an action
of a State is preempted depends on the availability or feasibility of
the technology being imposed by such State. A preemption determination
is predicated on whether the action being taken by the State falls
within the zone of activities that were covered by the Federal
assertion of preemption in the Federal statute. The availability or
feasibility of technology is not a consideration.

Question 2. In your opinion, is this a climate rule masquerading as
a hazardous emissions rule?
Answer. In my opinion, the principal reasons for CARB adopting this
in use locomotive rule are related to CARB's desire to eliminate
internal combustion engines in transportation. My opinion is based on
CARB's actions and statements over the years as well as the statement
at a meeting I attended when I was at BNSF by the former Chairman of
CARB that the agency intended to eliminate internal combustion engines.

Question 3. During the hearing it was discussed whether CARB
considered the full economic impact of the regulation, including
secondary and tertiary impacts on supply chains. Ms. Arias responded,
``[w]e did not do analysis of supply chains.'' \5\ In your opinion, can
you explain whether a policy of this magnitude be considered under the
Administrative Procedure Act process?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. In my testimony I discussed my strong belief that
locomotive emissions regulation may only be done by the Environmental
Protection Agency in a notice and comment rulemaking that would be
subject to the Administrative Procedure Act and all other requirements
that govern federal notice and comment rulemakings. It is particularly
important that an action which will have significant national effects
be done at the federal level, where all interested parties may comment
and the federal agency reviewing the comments is legally required to
consider all potential impacts, not just those on one particular state.

Question 4. In her testimony, Ms. Arias reiterated the claim that
the In-Use Locomotive Regulation ``are not regulating engine
manufacturers''.\6\ Please elaborate on why this is a distinction
without a difference.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. Any locomotive that is purchased by a rail carrier, either
passenger or freight, only has utility and value if it is used in
revenue service. The CARB regulation, while not purporting to regulate
engine manufacturers, attempts to create a de facto national use
standard. Were such a standard to go into effect, then locomotive
purchasers could only use locomotives that complied with the in-use
standard and thus if a manufacturer wanted to sell any, it would need
to sell use-compliant units. Importantly, part of CARB's analysis
included discussions with locomotive manufacturers to ascertain the
feasibility of such compliant locomotives, thus demonstrating the
importance of manufacturers to the CARB proposal.

Questions to Heather Arias, Chief, Transportation and Toxics Division,
California Air Resources Board, from Hon. Troy E. Nehls

Question 1. In response to a question from Representative Foushee
concerning the state of zero emissions locomotive technology, you
stated that catenary systems are a viable compliance option.
However, an analysis found that catenary systems would be
prohibitively expensive and provides less pulling power than is
necessary for Class I freight.\1\ In addition, the electric grid in the
State of California is already stretched and experiences frequent
mandatory brownouts. The same analysis determined that the In-Use
Locomotive Regulation will require California to invest between $780-
$830 million or up to $2.1 billion in added power capacity just in
California. As the rule is expected to require the industry to shift
its entire locomotive fleet, according to CARB, this will result in
similar costs incurred in other states. Any such build-out would
require addressing difficult technological challenges and necessary
permitting, which adds time frames measured in years.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) disagrees with
the premises of this question. For example, CARB disagrees that
catenary rail would be prohibitively expensive or would provide
inadequate pulling power. Catenary rail is used throughout the world to
move freight and, historically, was employed in many areas of the
United States. The Brattle Memorandum referenced above relies on an
outdated technology assessment. Current catenary technology powers
trains with some of the heaviest hauls in the world.\2\

0167.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CARB also disagrees that California experiences frequent brownouts.
California's energy grid has not experienced energy demand-driven
outages in some time due in part to steps the state has taken to
improve reliability including expanding its clean energy portfolio and
increasing battery storage.\3\ California's robust energy planning is
discussed further below.

trump-california-blackouts-electricity-grid/index.html.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CARB also disagrees that the In-Use Locomotive Regulation
(Locomotive Regulation) will require railroads to make changes outside
of California.

Question 1.a. Has CARB considered whether the State's grid will
have the capacity to serve the rail industry and other energy users?
Answer. Yes. As part of CARB's rulemaking process CARB prepared a
Final Environmental Analysis for the Proposed In-Use Locomotive
Regulation \4\ addressing long-term operation-related impacts on energy
within California. The analysis concluded that long-term energy impacts
associated with the Regulation would be less than significant due to
the forecasted increase in California's energy capacity.\5\ California
has robust planning processes in place to forecast energy demands and
ensure grid reliability. These processes involve the utilities and
their regulator (the California Public Utilities Commission), the
California Independent System Operator that operates the part of the
grid that serves most of California, the California Energy Commission
(CEC), and CARB. A key part of these processes is the long-term
forecast analysis conducted by the CEC, which plans for projected
increases in demand and will include the energy demands of the
Locomotive Regulation.\6\

Question 1.b. How has CARB accounted for the feasibility and
logistics of power generation and grid construction capacity in
formulating the In-Use Locomotive Rule?
Answer. The processes for energy forecasting and planning described
above address the need for additional power generation and grid
capacity for the Regulation, as they do for all anticipated changes in
energy demand.

Question 1.c. How did CARB estimate the impact of this regulation
on the State's broader economy-wide electrification strategy? Assuming
CARB conducts such analysis, are they done in isolation according to
each proposed policy or rule, or are they aggregated to measure impacts
across the entire power network?
Answer. Again, California's processes for energy forecasting and
planning described above comprehensively address present and future
energy demands in the state, including demands from the Locomotive
Regulation and other CARB regulations.

Question 2. During your testimony, you stated that CARB has been
working with California Class III railroads on incentive and
alternative compliance programs. But it is our understanding that this
outreach to date has been minimal and that CARB employees have not
visited many railroad sites to obtain valuable insight into short line
operations.
Question 2.a. How many Class III railroad sites did CARB personnel
visit during preparation of the Regulation?
Answer. CARB went to three railroad sites and held multiple virtual
meetings with Class III operators to get their input on the Locomotive
Regulation. Those meetings were generally virtual (rather than in-
person) because of the COVID-19 Pandemic. The California Short Line
Railroad Association (CSLRA) and CARB also met virtually on multiple
occasions. CARB also held four public workshops as it developed the
Regulation. CSLRA and individual Class III railroads were invited to
all of these and CSLRA and many Class III railroads attended.
CSLRA and its members were sent information about funding
opportunities available through State and local government for zero
emission rail. The CSLRA and other Class III operators were invited to
a webinar for the Grant Orientation for Zero Emission Rail Operation
(GO ZERO) program CARB started in November 2023 to assist Class III
operators in obtaining federal grant funds. As a result, CARB has
applied for federal funding on behalf of three Class III operators to
replace 10 diesel locomotives with zero emission locomotives.

Question 2.b. Please describe your outreach plan to Class III
railroads related to the In-Use Locomotive Regulation in California.
Answer. CARB has had communication with Class III operators and the
CSLRA during the outreach and regulatory development phases of the
Locomotive Regulation and after CARB Board approval. On April 27, 2023,
the Board directed CARB staff to continue outreach efforts to ensure
that affected industry are aware of the requirements of the Locomotive
Regulation, with a focus on Class III and industrial operators, and
available incentive funding opportunities. In response to this
Resolution, CARB launched the GO ZERO program as discussed above, to
help California's Class III and industrial operators adopt and use zero
emission rail technologies with minimal costs. Additionally, each
operator has been informed of the opportunity to meet with CARB staff
individually to discuss funding and compliance pathways.

Question 2.c. It is unacceptable the short lines be forced to cease
operations as a result of this regulation. Please explain how CARB will
work with short lines who are not able to utilize the alternative
compliance plans that are provided in the regulation.
Answer. CARB disagrees with the premise of the question. Moreover,
due to the smaller size of their fleets, short lines would typically
need to modify (or acquire, if the railroad so chooses) only a handful
of locomotives to qualify for the Alternative Fleet Milestone Option.
And, as stated, CARB has developed and provided a number of tools for
railroads to identify potential grant funding opportunities to assist
in meeting the requirements of the Locomotive Regulation. There are
several examples of Class III railroads obtaining millions in grant
funds to upgrade their older locomotives. For example, Watco received
$15.7 million in federal funding through the 2023 CRISI program to
convert eight Tier 0 locomotives into battery-powered ZE
locomotives.\7\ In addition, as of July, the Volkswagen (VW)
Environmental Mitigation Trust for California has received applications
to fund up to $1.6M per locomotive for the replacement of 35 diesel
locomotives (27 pre-Tier 0, 1 Tier 1, and 7 Tier 3) with 19 Tier 4 and
6 zero emission locomotives. This year alone the VW Mitigation Trust
and GO ZERO program will assist with the funds to replace 20% of all
California short line locomotives. Thus, it is plausible that most
short line railroads will be able to obtain the necessary funds to
comply if they do not have sufficient funding. CARB is always willing
to help any railroad identify funding opportunities that may be
available to them.

the regulation.\8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CARB anticipates that short lines with more than $5 million in
revenues would have the resources to seek and obtain funding and/or
otherwise comply with the Regulation through one of the various
compliance paths. In the event an individual short line faces
particularly difficult circumstances, CARB is always willing to discuss
those circumstances with the short line, to advise on various
compliance and funding options.

Question to Heather Arias, Chief, Transportation and Toxics Division,
California Air Resources Board, from Hon. Vince Fong

Question 1. In 2005, CARB entered into a voluntary agreement with
BNSF and UP to reduce emissions at rail yards.\9\ The agreement stated:
``The parties recognize that Participating Railroads are federally
regulated and that aspects of state and local authority to regulate
railroads are preempted.'' \10\ It further stated, ``the Federal Clean
Air Act, the Interstate Commerce Termination Act and many other laws
establish a uniform federal system of equipment and operational
requirements.'' CARB acknowledged Federal preemption in this agreement.
When I asked ``what changed,'' you responded that the ``technology
changed.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ Id.
\10\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, none of these laws base or limit preemption on technology,
nor do they compel adoption of new emissions limits under Federal law.
Section 209(e)(1) of the Clean Air Act explicitly precludes state or
political subdivisions from adopting or attempting to enforce any
standard or other requirement related to the control of emissions from
either of the following new nonroad engines or nonroad vehicles subject

engines in locomotives.\11\

In addition, as CARB acknowledged as part of the 2015 Agreement,
the Interstate Commerce Committee Termination Act ``preempts all state

Nober).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CARB acknowledged as part of the 2015 Voluntary Agreement with BNSF
and UP that state and local-based regulation of emissions is preempted
under Federal law. From what source does CARB draw legal authority to
negate Federal preemption of the In Use Locomotive rule?
Answer. Neither the text quoted in the referenced documents nor
anything else in those documents establishes that CARB previously
adopted the broad view of ICCTA preemption suggested by the question.
As the quoted text indicates, CARB has previously indicated it
understands that ``aspects of state and local authority to regulate
railroads are preempted.'' CARB has not changed this view; it still
understands that ICCTA preempts certain state and local regulations.
Nothing in those quotations or the referenced documents, however,
indicates that CARB ``acknowledged'' that all state ``regulation of
emissions is preempted under Federal law.''
Rather, the documents indicate that CARB understood it would face
litigation risk if it sought to regulate locomotive emissions because
the railroads would likely take the position that any such effort by
CARB is preempted by ICCTA. Far from asserting that state-level
regulation of locomotive emissions is always preempted, CARB noted that
``neither the STB nor the courts have to date addressed the specific
substantive matters included in the Agreement''--i.e., the emission
control measures in the Agreement. CARB further noted the ``likelihood
of a legal challenge by the railroads'' should CARB adopt regulations
similar to the measures in the Agreement. Accordingly, CARB believed--
at the time and in the circumstances present there--that the Agreement
was preferable in order to achieve ``immediate statewide emission
reductions.''
Two railroad trade associations have challenged the Regulation on
ICCTA preemption grounds (among others). CARB has asserted its views in
its filings in that case which are publicly available, one of which is
attached hereto.\14\ For example, CARB has noted that the Clean Air Act
expressly preserves authority--subject to EPA authorization--for
California to regulate emissions from non-new locomotives.\15\ CARB
declines to reiterate or expand on its views here, considering pending
litigation.

Questions to Heather Arias, Chief, Transportation and Toxics Division,
California Air Resources Board, from Hon. Henry C. ``Hank'' Johnson,
Jr.

Question 1. Ms. Arias, in your testimony, you highlight significant
health benefits that is projected to reduce emergency room visits and
hospitalizations by 1,500 cases related to respiratory illnesses and
other health impacts caused by diesel particulate matter and nitrogen
oxide emissions.
Can you elaborate on the strategies or provisions within the
regulation are specifically targeted at mitigating the health impacts
from diesel particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions, and how
are these expected to contribute to reducing emergency room visits and
hospitalizations?
Answer. The Locomotive Regulation is designed to reduce emissions
from non-new locomotives operating in California. Locomotives generate
significant emissions of PM2.5 and NOx, contributing approximately 650
tons per year (tpy) of PM2.5 and 30,000tpy of NOx in California.\16\
Human exposure to diesel particulate matter and nitrogen oxides can
cause heart and lung damage and lead to emergency room visits and
hospitalizations. Reduction of emissions leads to less exposure, and
thus less emergency room visits and hospitalizations. CARB estimates
that these emissions reductions will prevent approximately 3,200
premature deaths, 1,100 hospital admissions and 1,500 emergency room
visits in California.\17\

Question 2. In your testimony, you highlighted the significant role
of locomotives as a source of criteria pollutants in California. This
is particularly concerning as it affects vulnerable residential
communities already highly impacted by nitrogen oxide (NOx) and toxic
diesel particulate matter, for which there is no known safe level of
exposure.
Could you elaborate on the specific impacts affecting marginalized
communities and the comprehensive measures being implemented to
mitigate pollution near railyards and similar facilities?
Answer. Over 90% of railyards in California are within one mile of
at least one Disadvantaged Community defined by California Senate Bill
535. People living in Disadvantaged Communities experience unjust
inequities and disproportionate pollution. Diesel exhaust emitted by
locomotives can cause cancer in humans,\18\ and people living closer to
railyards experience higher diesel exhaust exposure and higher cancer
risk.\19\\,\ \20\ High diesel exhaust exposure is also linked to heart
and lung disease.\21\ Switcher locomotives operating in railyards are
often the dirtiest, worsening the inequitable impacts to people living
near railyards. Vibrations, noise pollution, and light pollution near
railyards are also a significant concern.

Research shows that pollution exposures disproportionately impact
people of color.\22\ This inequity persists when looking specifically
at rail activity. Communities with the highest pollution exposures from
major railyards in California have larger proportions of people of
color. This disproportionality was identified in previous studies
looking at specific California railyards. For example, in Los Angeles
County in 1980, around the time when a major railyard was being
approved for construction, more than half of a nearby community
consisted of people of color.\23\ In comparison, Los Angeles County at
that time was more than half non-Hispanic white. In San Bernardino,
Hispanics/Latinos comprised more than 71% of people surveyed from a
region that was on average 1.9 miles from a major freight railyard.\24\

CARB established the Community Air Protection Program (CAPP) to
focus on reducing air pollution exposures in such EJ communities in
response to Assembly Bill (AB) 617. This first-of-its-kind statewide
effort includes community air monitoring and community emissions
reduction programs. In addition, the Legislature appropriated funding
to support early actions to address localized air pollution through
targeted incentive funding to deploy cleaner technologies in these
communities, as well as grants to support community participation in
the AB 617 process. Out of the ten Assembly Bill 617 communities from
the first year of this program, nine of them have rail activity as a
contributing factor.
The Locomotive Regulation will significantly benefit marginalized
communities, both broadly by reducing non-new locomotive emissions
across California and specifically by creating incentives to operate ZE
technology in Disadvantaged Communities.\25\

CARB has taken other steps to reduce pollution near railyards as
well. The Advanced Clean Fleets regulation will work in conjunction
with the Advanced Clean Trucks regulation to reduce emissions from
drayage trucks operating at seaports and railyards. Amendments to the
Transportation Refrigeration Unit (TRU) regulations will reduce
particulate matter emissions and transition a portion of TRUs, which
operate near railyards and ports, to zero emissions. Significant
pollution reductions and health benefits will also be achieved by the
Ocean-Going Vessel Fuel, Ocean-Going Vessel At Berth, Heavy-Duty Low
NOx, Small Off-Road Engine, Commercial Harbor Craft, Advanced Clean
Cars II, and In-Use Off-Road Diesel-Fueled Fleets regulations.

Questions to Heather Arias, Chief, Transportation and Toxics Division,
California Air Resources Board, from Hon. Doug LaMalfa

Question 1. In questioning the scope of the CARB In-Use Locomotive
Regulation, you stated that military traffic and shipments by rail are
``exempt'' from the regulation. You reiterated this point many times.
Although military owned and operated locomotives are exempted,
military equipment is often transported across the country by
commercial shippers, including Union Pacific and BNSF, that are most
definitely not exempt from the In-Use Locomotive Regulation. In a
national emergency, the military will contract with these private
shippers to move millions of tons of military vehicles, armaments, and
associated equipment via road and rail through California to airports
and shipping ports for deployment. As equivalent zero emission
locomotive technology does not exist, this would have very negative
ramifications for our national security. CARB's own analysis determined
that the Regulation would impact the nationwide fleets of BNSF and
Union Pacific.
Question 1.a. Given this reality, does CARB stand by its claim that
all military rail traffic is exempted?
Answer. Military locomotives are exempt from the Locomotive
Regulation, and it will not affect military rail traffic in a national
emergency. While military rail traffic served by private operators is
not explicitly listed as an exemption, the Locomotive Regulation has
flexibility that would allow for emergency military rail traffic to
continue without requiring the operator transporting the military cargo
to meet Locomotive Regulation requirements. Please see part b below for
details.

Question 1.b. How would CARB exempt military rail shipments moving
on private carriers from the Regulation?
Answer. Operators carrying military rail shipments during national
emergencies and unable to comply with the Locomotive Regulation during
this time would be able to obtain a Temporary Operating Extension under
Section 2478.6(a)(2) of the regulation. Temporary Operating Extensions
are available for emergency events beyond an operator's control,
including, but not limited to, ``fires, floods, earthquakes, embargoes,
epidemics, quarantines, war, acts of terrorism, riots, strikes, or
lockouts''. National military emergencies would qualify as an emergency
event beyond an operator's control.

Question 1.c. In the 2022 CARB Staff Report: Initial Statement of
Reasons, CARB explained that it was ``necessary to exempt military
locomotives from the Proposed Regulation as it may limit military
operators' ability to maintain surge capacity to respond to emergencies
and security threats.'' Please elaborate on the specific technical
findings by your agency that led you to conclude that the regulation
could limit DOD's freight transportation capacity relative to the
operational requirements that must be met by their locomotive fleet.
Answer. The Locomotive Regulation does not limit DOD's ability to
respond to emergencies and security threats when it comes to freight
transportation capacity. Please see part b above for details on how
emergency military rail traffic does not need to meet In-Use Locomotive
Regulation requirements.

Question 1.d. How many military locomotives in California fall
under this exemption, and what EPA emissions tiers do those locomotives
meet?
Answer. Data from the latest Military and Industrial Locomotive
Emission Inventory shows there are 13 military locomotives operating in
California. All 13 military locomotives are Pre-Tier 0.\26\

Inventory, July 2022. (Weblink: https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/
files/2022-07/2022%20MI%20Locomotive%20Emission
%20Inventory%20Document%2007112022%20ADA%20Checked.pdf).

Question 1.e. During the development of the Regulation, did you
consult with the Department of Defense (DoD) on the issue of military
locomotives being subject to the Regulation? If so, please provide all
communications with DoD on this issue.
Answer. As the DoD's military locomotives are categorically exempt
under the Regulation, it was not necessary for CARB to discuss the
details of the Regulation with DoD. DoD did not submit comments during
any of the public comment periods for the Regulation or otherwise
contact CARB regarding any concerns about the Regulation. DoD likewise
did not submit comments during EPA's comment period on CARB's
authorization request, although other federal agencies did so.

Question 1.f. Please provide a summary of CARB's understanding of
the role that freight locomotives, subject to the regulation, play in
the transportation of military cargo in California. Approximately what
proportion of military cargo moving by rail in the state are carried by
trains hauled by locomotives that are not exempt from your regulation?
It is our understanding that a significant amount of military cargo
moves on railroads that would be subject to this Regulation.
Answer. CARB understands that private freight operators may
occasionally transport military cargo. However, quantitative
information about military cargo in California and military cargo that
private operators transport in California is not publicly available.
Such information was not provided--either by DoD or any of the
railroads who commented--during the public comment periods or pre-
rulemaking outreach for the Locomotive Regulation. It is notable that,
concerns about military cargo traffic were not raised by private rail
operators who otherwise commented extensively on the Regulation. CARB
would welcome any new information the railroads would like to provide--
including quantitative information regarding military cargo transport--
and would consider that information as appropriate and relevant.
