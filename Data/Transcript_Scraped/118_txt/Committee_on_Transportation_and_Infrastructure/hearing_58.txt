Programs''
_______________________________________________________________________

I. PURPOSE

The Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings,
and Emergency Management of the Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure will meet on Wednesday, May 1, 2024, at 10:00
a.m. ET in 2167 of the Rayburn House Office Building to receive

Reviewing the Effectiveness and Costs of FEMA's Resilience
Programs.'' The hearing will examine the costs and benefits of
the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) increasing
emphasis on mitigation efforts. At the hearing, Members will
receive testimony from the Senior Official Performing the
Duties of Deputy Administrator for FEMA's Office of Resilience.

II. BACKGROUND

FEMA'S MISSION

FEMA is the Federal Government's lead agency for preparing
for, mitigating against, responding to, and recovering from
disasters and emergencies related to all hazards--whether
natural or man-made.\1\ FEMA's primary authority in carrying
out these functions stems from the Robert T. Stafford Disaster
Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) (P.L. 100-
707, as amended).\2\ The Stafford Act authorizes three types of
declarations: (1) major disaster declarations; (2) emergency
declarations; and (3) fire management grant (FMAG)
declarations.\3\ The Stafford Act authorizes the President to
approve states' requests for a Federal disaster declaration
when ``the situation is of such severity and magnitude that
effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and
affected local governments.'' \4\

III. HAZARD MITIGATION ASSISTANCE

FEMA provides hazard mitigation assistance through the
Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) programs.\5\ HMA includes
three grant programs: the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program
(HMGP), the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities
(BRIC) program, and the Flood Mitigation Assistance Grant
Program (FMA).\6\ Under the HMA, FEMA also administers a loan
program known as the Safeguarding Tomorrow Revolving Loan Fund
Program (STRLF).\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to the HMA programs, FEMA also provides hazard
mitigation funding through its Public Assistance (PA) and
Individual Assistance (IA) programs. Hazard mitigation funding
for PA is intended to help communities rebuild public
infrastructure in a way that accounts for future disasters.\8\
The same is true for IA when it comes to rebuilding residential
households.\9\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM

Authorized by Section 404 of the Stafford Act, HMGP makes
post-disaster mitigation funding available to state, local,
tribal, and territorial governments that have experienced a
presidentially declared disaster.\10\ HMGP is funded through
the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) as a formula grant subject to a
sliding scale based on a percentage of the estimated amount of
disaster assistance up to 15 percent.\11\ This funding can be
used for a wide range of projects including to develop hazard
mitigation plans, to elevate buildings in flood prone areas,
and to retrofit structures for hazards including hurricanes or
earthquakes.\12\ HMGP also provides assistance to states,
tribes, or territories that have experienced a fire which
resulted in a Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG)
declaration.\13\

BUILDING RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND COMMUNITIES

In 2018, Congress passed the Disaster Recovery Reform Act
(DRRA) (P.L. 115-254), which established a new pre-disaster
mitigation program.\15\ In response to DRRA, FEMA created the
BRIC program in FY 2020, which provides state, local, tribal,
and territorial governments with funding to complete hazard
mitigation projects.\16\ Prior to the establishment of BRIC,
FEMA's pre-disaster mitigation funding was available through
the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) Grant Program.\17\

\17\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike the PDM Grant Program, which was funded through
Congressional appropriations, BRIC is funded through a set
aside of up to six percent of annual disaster spending from the
DRF.\18\ BRIC also has three categories for awards (1) state/
territorial allocation, (2) tribal set aside, and (3) a
National competition.\19\ The National competition allows
states to submit additional projects to FEMA that are separate
from the state/territorial allocation.\20\ As FEMA's largest
pre-disaster mitigation program, ``[BRIC's] guiding principles
are supporting communities through capability and capacity
building; encouraging and enabling innovation; promoting
partnerships; enabling large infrastructure projects;
maintaining flexibility; and providing consistency.'' \21\

In addition to the six percent set-aside, Congress
appropriated an additional $1 billion for BRIC in the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (P.L. 117-58),
with $200 million annually for FY 2022 through FY 2026.\22\ On
October 12, 2023, FEMA published its notice of funding
opportunity which announced that $1 billion in BRIC funding
would be made available for FY 2023.\23\

eligible Federally recognized tribes, territories, and the
District of Columbia with funding to establish low-interest
revolving loan funds for mitigation projects primarily to be
used at the local level.\27\ The IIJA appropriated a total of
$500 million for the STRLF program, with up to $100 million for

IV. FEMA'S STRATEGIC PLAN

FEMA's mission is to help people before, during, and after
disasters.\29\ The 2022-2026 Strategic Plan lists three goals
for the agency to better achieve their mission: (1) instill
equity as a foundation of emergency management, (2) lead whole
of community in climate resilience, and (3) promote and sustain
a ready FEMA and prepared Nation.\30\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GOAL 1: EQUITY

In its 2021 Executive Order 13985 on ``Advancing Racial
Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the
Federal Government,'' the Biden Administration defines equity
as:

[T]he consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial
treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong
to underserved communities that have been denied such
treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native
American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and
other persons of color; members of religious minorities;
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+)
persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural
areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent
poverty or inequality.\31\

available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-06-30/pdf/
2021-14127.pdf.

To achieve this goal, FEMA has committed to ensure its
employees ``increasingly reflect the diversity of the
[N]ation.'' \32\ The Agency plans to make their programs more
accessible through a people first approach, to ensure FEMA
resources can be accessed by underserved communities.\33\ FEMA
commits to periodically assess their programs and policies for
inequities and redirect resources to eliminate any identified
shortcomings.\34\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GOAL 2: CLIMATE RESILIENCE

FEMA's Strategic Plan asserts that the number and severity
of disasters is increasing, and consequently some communities
are barely able to recover before another disaster strikes.\35\
In order to increase climate literacy among the emergency
management community, FEMA plans to integrate climate science
into ``policy, programs, partnerships, field operation, and
training.'' \36\ The Agency also plans to use mitigation grant
programs to allow communities to mitigate against climate
change.\37\ Finally, FEMA plans to expand ``the availability
of, access to, and understanding of future conditions data and
modeling'' \38\ to empower risk-informed decision making.

\38\ Id. at 18.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GOAL 3: FEMA READINESS

FEMA's Strategic Plan asserts that an increasing number of
disasters requires FEMA to have more staff readily deployable
in advance of disasters.\39\ To do this, FEMA will invest in
professional development and improve employee retention.\40\
Further, as evident with the COVID pandemic, FEMA needs to be
ready to respond to non-traditional Stafford Act disaster
categories. The Agency plans to increase their capacity to
mitigate against critical National capability gaps for all
disasters.\41\ FEMA also plans to unify coordination and
delivery of Federal assistance by working with other Federal
disaster partners to streamline the burdensome process.\42\

On March 11, 2024, President Biden released his FY 2025
Budget Request.\43\ Included in the FY 2025 Budget Request is
an $85 million increase for FEMA's climate resilience
initiatives.\44\ This includes:

VI. CONCLUSION

In recent years, FEMA has placed an increasing emphasis on
pre-disaster and post-disaster mitigation. The second goal of
FEMA's 2022-2026 Strategic Plan is to promote leading the whole
community in climate resilience. Furthermore, the President's
FY 2025 Budget Request includes an increase of $85 million in
funding for climate resilience initiatives. This hearing will
examine FEMA's existing mitigation work to better understand
the costs and benefits of these programs.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SCOTT PERRY OF PENNSYLVANIA,
CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC
BUILDINGS, AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

Mr. Perry. I want to thank our witness, Ms. Victoria
Salinas, the Senior Official Performing the Duties of Deputy
Administrator for FEMA's Office of Resilience, for being here
today.
Today's hearing will focus on examining the costs and
benefits of FEMA's increasing emphasis on mitigation.
FEMA provides hazard mitigation funding to State, Tribal,
and Territorial governments through several grant programs,
including the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program; the Building
Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, Program; and
the Flood Mitigation Assistance Grant Program. FEMA also
provides hazard mitigation funding through its Public
Assistance and Individual Assistance Programs.
FEMA reported that in fiscal year 2023, it had obligated
more than $2.93 billion in funding for hazard mitigation
grants. Going further back in time, FEMA obligated more than
$1.78 billion in fiscal year 2022, more than $2.34 billion in
fiscal year 2021, more than $1.31 billion in fiscal year 2020,
and more than $1.16 billion in fiscal year 2019.
I know the numbers kind of make people's eyes glaze over.
But that means that over the past 5 fiscal years, FEMA has
obligated more than $9.5 billion for mitigation grant funding.
That's a lot of money. That's not counting for all mitigation
assistance spent in the years prior. And given this huge sum of
money, obviously, we have several concerns.
First, despite literally spending billions of dollars on
mitigation work, FEMA continues to ask Congress for more money.
It is my understanding that FEMA is once again asking for
supplemental funding for the Disaster Relief Fund, which is
estimated to run out of money sometime this summer. And while
FEMA claims that hazard mitigation funding will reduce the cost
of disasters, FEMA continues to spend billions of dollars per
disaster. So, we are looking for where is the cost benefit, how
does the investment actually equal lower or less dollars being
spent.
FEMA's 2023 National Preparedness Report stated that
between January 2020 and December of 2022, there were 60
climate-related disasters, costing at least $1 billion each. We
fail to see how the $9.5 billion in mitigation funding has
significantly saved our taxpayers' dollars. I am not even sure
``significantly'' is the right word. But we are also concerned
that the types of mitigation projects that FEMA is choosing to
fund, we are concerned about them. And in reviewing some of the
more recent mitigation projects approved by FEMA, terms like
``nature-based solutions'' and ``climate resilience'' appear in
many of the project descriptions.
FEMA is funding projects to plant trees and improve habitat
for wildlife. It is all very nice, but I am not sure it is part
of the core mission and something we need to be spending tax
dollars on, as none of this is within the scope of
responsibility of FEMA's mission. And if that's where FEMA is
funneling our taxpayer funds, is the Agency really achieving
the stated goals of these mitigation grants, which is to reduce
disaster costs and save lives?
Further, concerningly, FEMA has continued to struggle to
make hazard mitigation funding available to the communities
that need it the most. The application process to receive
mitigation grants is complicated; so complex, in fact, it
creates real challenges for small communities attempting to
apply for these funds. And those who cannot afford to hire
grant writers are the ones that are at a loss.
We see that wealthier States with the means to pay for
outside consultants and grant writers successfully received
FEMA funds, while smaller States are passed over. Are these
funds truly being focused on reducing risk where it is most
needed?
So, what I really want to know is how FEMA is awarding
these funds. Is the Agency actually targeting investments to
strategically counter the effect of natural disasters? Or is it
simply funneling money to States that have the resources
available to jump through the hurdles and complete the
application process?
FEMA's BRIC Program is a prime illustration of those
concerns. For the first 3 years of funding, 5 States,
accounting for 30 percent of the Nation's population, received
50 percent, half, through the BRIC, whereas 24 smaller States,
accounting for 21 percent of the Nation's population, combined
were only awarded 5 percent of BRIC funding. That is a pretty
stark contrast. In fact, according to analysis done by outside
groups, the San Francisco and New York metro areas have been
the most successful in applying for BRIC funding. Is there any
accountability whatsoever for this? How can FEMA justify its
allocation of funds?
We want to discuss these questions with our witness today,
and we want to dig into how FEMA determines which projects have
the merit to receive mitigation funding, and whether the
process targets funding to projects that actually mitigate
against disasters.
FEMA can't solve everyone's problems, and if FEMA is going
to fund mitigation, at the very least, the projects should
demonstrate they will actually reduce the cost of disasters. As
a matter of fact, that's the point of it.
With that, I look forward to hearing from our witness on
these issues.
[Mr. Perry's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Scott Perry, a Representative in Congress
from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and Chairman, Subcommittee on
Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management
I want to thank our witness, Ms. Victoria Salinas, the Senior
Official Performing the Duties of Deputy Administrator for FEMA's
Office of Resilience, for being here today.
Today's hearing will focus on examining the costs and benefits of
FEMA's increasing emphasis on mitigation.
FEMA provides hazard mitigation funding to state, tribal, and
territorial governments through several grant programs including the
Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), the Building Resilient
Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Program, and the Flood Mitigation
Assistance Grant Program (FMA). FEMA also provides hazard mitigation
funding through its Public Assistance (PA) and Individual Assistance
(IA) programs.
FEMA reported that in fiscal year 2023, it had obligated more than
$2.93 billion in funding for hazard mitigation grants. Going further
back in time, FEMA obligated more than $1.78 billion in fiscal year
2022, more than $2.34 billion in fiscal year 2021, more than $1.31
billion in fiscal year 2020, and more than $1.16 billion in fiscal year
2019. That means that over the past five fiscal years, FEMA has
obligated more than $9.5 billion for mitigation grant funding. That's
not counting all the mitigation assistance spent in the years prior.
Given this huge sum of money, I have several concerns.
First, despite literally spending billions of dollars on mitigation
work, FEMA continues to ask Congress for more money. It is my
understanding that FEMA is once again asking for supplemental funding
for the Disaster Relief Fund, which is estimated to run out of money
sometime this summer. And while FEMA claims that hazard mitigation
funding will reduce the costs of disasters, FEMA continues to spend
billions of dollars per disaster. FEMA's 2023 National Preparedness
Report stated that between January 2020 and December 2022 there were 60
``climate-related'' disasters, costing at least $1 billion each. I fail
to see how that $9.5 billion in mitigation funding has significantly
saved our taxpayer dollars.
I am also concerned with the types of mitigation projects that FEMA
is choosing to fund. In reviewing some of the more recent mitigation
projects approved by FEMA, terms like ``nature-based solutions'' and
``climate resilience'' appear in many of the project descriptions. FEMA
is funding projects to plant trees and improve habitat for wildlife.
None of this is within the scope or responsibility of FEMA's mission.
And if that's where FEMA is funneling our taxpayer funds--is the agency
really achieving the stated goals of these mitigation grants, which is
to reduce disaster costs and save lives?
Further, concerningly FEMA has continued to struggle to make hazard
mitigation funding available to the communities that may need it the
most. The application process to receive mitigation grants is
complicated--so complex, in fact, it creates real challenges for small
communities attempting to apply for these funds. We see wealthier
states with the means to pay for outside consultants successfully
receive FEMA funds while smaller states are passed over. Are these
funds truly being focused on reducing risk where it is most needed? So,
what I really want to know is how is FEMA awarding these funds? Is the
agency actually targeting investments to strategically counter the
effects of natural disasters, or is it simply funneling money to states
that have the resources available to jump through the hurdles and
complete the application process?
FEMA's BRIC Program is a prime illustration of these concerns. For
the first three years of funding, five states, accounting for 30
percent of the nation's population, received half of the money through
BRIC, whereas 24 smaller states, accounting for 21 percent of the
nation's population, combined were only awarded five percent of BRIC
funding. That's a stark contrast.
In fact, according to analysis done by outside groups, the San
Francisco and New York metro areas have been the most successful in
applying for BRIC funding. Where is the accountability? How can FEMA
justify its allocation of funds? I want to discuss these questions with
our witness today. I want to dig into how FEMA determines which
projects have the merit to receive mitigation funding, and whether the
process targets funding to projects that actually mitigate against
disasters.
FEMA can't solve everyone's problems, and if FEMA is going to fund
mitigation, at the very least the projects should demonstrate they will
actually reduce the costs of disasters.
With that, I look forward to hearing from our witness on these
issues.

Titus, for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DINA TITUS OF NEVADA, RANKING MEMBER,
SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC BUILDINGS, AND
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Ms.
Salinas, for being here today to talk about FEMA's mitigation
programs.
Climate change and related severe weather events have
changed the disaster landscape, and they are devastating
communities of all sizes, rural, urban, across the country.
Responding to these disasters really isn't enough. Proactive
mitigation strategies are necessary to build resilience before
disasters, so communities have a chance to bounce back.
Therefore, I am proud of this committee's bipartisan history of
supporting mitigation efforts with demonstrable returns on
investment.
In the past 5 years, FEMA's mitigation program, combination
of programs, has grown substantially at Congress' direction to
address these disaster impact trends and ensure public safety.
In 2020, FEMA awarded the first round of BRIC grants, making
unprecedented funding available to States before disasters to
implement large and innovative programs. Last year, FEMA
awarded the first capitalization grants for the Safeguarding
Tomorrow Revolving Loan Fund Program, which was finally funded
thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
Before these pre-disaster programs, FEMA's mitigation
investments came almost entirely post-disaster through the
Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. This program remains
critically important and still accounts for the largest
percentage of FEMA's hazard mitigation spending, but the
Safeguarding Tomorrow Fund and the BRIC Program are finally
providing communities the proactive tools they need.
Since its authorization, FEMA has invested $4.5 billion in
pre-disaster mitigation through the BRIC Program, and State and
local governments are demonstrating considerable demand, with
the most recent funding opportunity being five times
oversubscribed. Additional actions at the State and local level
also indicate a growing interest in mitigation efforts to
protect homes and infrastructure. States and cities from
Mobile, Alabama, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, including Clark
County, Nevada, where my district is, are establishing hazard
mitigation offices, resiliency centers, and chief resilience
officer positions to strategically identify local mitigation
opportunities.
Now, talk about saving money, it's not surprising that
investments in mitigation are proven to save money. Every $1
invested in mitigation results in up to $13 saved post-
disaster.
We have also got to continue to prioritize the equitable
distribution of these investments to disadvantaged communities
that may be hit hardest by the disasters, take the longest to
recover, and have the fewest resources to be able to do that.
I have heard from these communities that they are often
unable to successfully apply for the Federal mitigation grant
funding due to a lack of capacity and resources. And that is
why I support President Biden's Justice40 Initiative to
allocate 40 percent of BRIC and flood mitigation assistance
grants to disadvantaged communities, and the Community Disaster
Resilience Zone Act led by Representative Davids here in the
House to identify census tracts that are most in need and most
at risk to natural disasters.
Finally, access to mitigation funding can't stop at the
local level. I believe homeowners should have the chance to
access mitigation funds to protect their families and their
financial security. Unfortunately, homeowners often can't
retrofit their homes with recommended mitigation measures
because they are just too expensive. Last year, I filed a
successful amendment to H.R. 5473 that will create a pilot
program for making individual homes more resilient to all
hazards. It's my hope that it will be enacted before the end of
the year so we will have an opportunity to measure its
effectiveness.
Ms. Salinas, I thank you and your colleagues for your hard
work to implement FEMA's growing suite of mitigation programs,
and I look forward to more conversation about how this
essential work not only saves taxpayer dollars but improves
public safety.
Thank you, and I yield back.
[Ms. Titus' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Dina Titus, a Representative in Congress
from the State of Nevada, and Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Economic
Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank our witness for joining us
today to discuss FEMA's mitigation programs.

the disaster landscape and are devastating communities nationwide.

This is not surprising as investments in mitigation are proven to

$13 saved post-disaster.
We must also continue to prioritize the equitable distribution of
these investments to disadvantaged communities that may be hit hardest
by disasters and take the longest to recover. I've heard from these

taxpayer dollars and improves public safety.

Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlewoman.
The Chair now recognizes the ranking member of the full
committee, Mr. Larsen, for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, subcommittee Chair
Perry and subcommittee Ranking Member Titus, for calling
today's hearing. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the
impact and performance of FEMA's hazard mitigation programs,
especially as one of the counties in my district is still
recovering and rebuilding from November 21 floods.
Disasters cost taxpayers billions of dollars each year.
Last year, climate and weather-related disasters caused over
$92.9 billion in impacts nationwide. This figure is not an
anomaly. In the past 5 years, the average annual cost for
disasters in the U.S. was $119 billion.
FEMA can help States and disaster survivors cover some
recovery costs, but many disasters go undeclared, which means
homeowners, farmers, business owners, and State and local
governments are paying the majority of disaster damage bills.
This slows economic growth and recovery. It's unsustainable as
well for those who live in the path of increasingly frequent
and severe disasters.
So, hazard mitigation does offer a solution. And according
to the National Institute of Building Sciences, every $1
invested in hazard mitigation results in $13 saved. FEMA
projects that nationwide adoption of modern building codes also
would save $600 billion in disaster impacts by 2060.
In order to reduce the cost of future disasters, Congress
and FEMA have dramatically expanded the mitigation grant
programs the Agency offers. So, before 2018, almost all of the
mitigation funding FEMA provided was only available to States
after a disaster. The creation of BRIC and the Safeguarding
Tomorrow Loan Fund have changed that. Since 2020, FEMA has been
able to award over $5 billion for mitigation projects before
disaster strikes. This proactive approach is needed to protect
communities, and I strongly support the additional investments
that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law made in these programs.
State and local demand for pre-disaster mitigation funding
is very clear. FEMA's competitive Pre-Disaster Mitigation
Program, the BRIC Program, is consistently oversubscribed more
than four times over. That is why I support increasing the set-
aside for the BRIC Program from 6 to 15 percent of annual
Disaster Relief Fund spending. More money spent on resilience
before disasters means less money spent on repairs after.
Now, making Federal funding available for mitigation
projects is just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Money needs
to get out the door to eligible States and local governments in
a timely manner, and the funds need to be accessible to the
most disadvantaged communities.
All new grant programs face some implementation challenges.
The Pre-Disaster Mitigation Programs have not been an exception
to that. According to information from FEMA, 77 award winners
for the fiscal year 2020 BRIC funding cycle and 112 applicants
for the fiscal year 2021 funding cycle have not yet received
full funding. FEMA needs to make sure those funds get out the
door promptly.
However, I am pleased with other efforts FEMA has made to
improve the BRIC application process by simplifying the
benefit-cost analysis requirements and offering technical
assistance to disadvantaged communities. The positive impact of
these changes is already noticeable as the Resilience Office
has reported receiving a greater number of applications from
new applicants.
So, I look forward to discussing solutions to continue
improving program efficiency and getting mitigation funding out
the door faster into the hands of communities.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is improving our Nation's
resilience by providing $5 billion to help communities
proactively prepare for disasters, but there is still a long
way to go.
I applaud the administration's prioritization of resilience
to keep communities safe and to reduce disaster recovery costs.
So, Ms. Salinas, I look forward to discussing with you how we
can work together to make FEMA's mitigation programs even more
effective in the future.
Thank you for being here. I look forward to the testimony.
With that, I yield back.

TESTIMONY OF VICTORIA SALINAS, SENIOR OFFICIAL PERFORMING THE
DUTIES OF DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR, OFFICE OF RESILIENCE, FEDERAL
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY

Ms. Salinas. Thank you so much, and good morning.
Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Larsen, Ranking Member
Titus, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for this
opportunity to speak with you today about FEMA's evolving role
in hazard mitigation. We value this subcommittee's legislative
support and oversight of our Agency, and I really look forward
to today's conversation.
Communities today face an increasing set of challenges,
from atmospheric rivers to once-in-a-century fires. In 2023
alone, NOAA calculated that the U.S. sustained 28 disasters
that each cost $1 billion or more. That's the most ever in a
single year on record.
At FEMA, our mission is helping people before, during, and
after disasters. And our Agency is spearheading efforts to
bolster communities' ability to understand and fulfill their
role related to increasing disaster resilience. Improved
resilience saves lives, results in less complex recoveries, and
helps break the disaster cycle.
If we are going to help prepare our communities in the
future, then we need to invest in the communities before a
disaster strikes. One way FEMA is working to achieve this goal
is through our suite of grant programs. Our Hazard Mitigation
Assistance Program provides critical funding to invest in cost-
effective activities that build a community's resilience while
lowering future disaster costs. Despite historic funding levels
across our programs, we continue to see more applications come
in than funding is available each year. These programs are
helping across our Nation.
For example, the Building Resilient Infrastructure and
Communities Program, BRIC, for the fiscal year 2022 grant cycle
saw the largest BRIC notice of funding ever at $2.3 billion. We
selected 50 States, 35 Tribal nations, 4 Territories, and the
District of Columbia to receive funding pending final review of
their projects.
One example of these projects is from Jefferson Parish,
Louisiana, where they are hardening power infrastructure to
protect their community. This means that after a storm, not
only will individuals and households be protected, but critical
facilities, too.
State and local demand for project funding and technical
assistance is only growing. Through the fiscal year 2023 BRIC
application cycle, we saw a record number of requests for BRIC
direct technical assistance come in, with 164 submissions and
asks for support from all 10 FEMA regions. Through this
program, FEMA provides tailored support to communities and
Tribal nations that may not have resources to do the planning
and project design on their own. FEMA has already announced for
BRIC DTA 74 communities and Tribal nations for the program, and
this year, we look to select another 80.
Up-to-date building codes are another efficient and cost-
effective way to safeguard our communities. Therefore, we also
established a new set-aside, a plus-up in our Building
Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program in the fiscal
year 2023 grant cycle, and we saw $52 million worth of building
codes-related projects come in. That is a record breaking
number for FEMA.
Our portfolio of hazard mitigation grants also includes the
Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which provides funding to
develop mitigation plans and retrofit in ways that reduce the
impact of future disaster losses. We also provide
capitalization grants for mitigation projects through the
Safeguarding Tomorrow Revolving Loan Fund. This new revolving
loan fund is helping States, Tribes, and Territories finance
projects to reduce risk. These funds can be used as required
local match, which means that they can be used for match for
even FEMA programs, providing additional flexibility to
communities. This reduces and helps eliminate barriers for many
small rural and other communities with limited capacities that
they may face.
Recently, FEMA and DHS also announced more than $1.8
billion in funding for our eight fiscal year 2024 preparedness
grant programs that help stakeholders prevent and respond to
acts of terrorism as well as hazards.
Education and training are also key, and through our
partnership with the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium,
we offer over 190 trainings each year that are reaching
thousands of emergency managers, first responders, and local
leaders.
FEMA is also working to bolster resilience through the
establishment of Community Disaster Resilience Zones and
announced the first 483 zones last September. These
designations will leverage collaboration and cross-sector
coordination across all levels of Government, philanthropy,
businesses, and academia.
As we look to the challenges ahead, we are currently
implementing changes to accelerate the grant programs and build
capacity. FEMA looks forward to our continued work with this
subcommittee to mitigate hazards and build a more resilient
Nation.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look
forward to our conversation and your questions.
[Ms. Salinas' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Victoria Salinas, Senior Official Performing the
Duties of Deputy Administrator, Office of Resilience, Federal Emergency
Management Agency, U.S. Department of Homeland Security
Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and Members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today
about the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) evolving role in
hazard mitigation. We value this Subcommittee's legislative support and
oversight of our agency, and I look forward to our conversation today.
From atmospheric rivers to once-in-a-century fires, communities
today face an increasingly complex set of challenges. In 2023 alone,
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration calculated that the
United States sustained 28 disasters that each cost $1 billion or
more--the most ever in a single year on record.
FEMA's mission is helping people before, during, and after
disasters, and our agency is spearheading efforts to bolster
communities' ability to understand, and fulfill, their roles related to
increasing their own local disaster resilience. Improved resilience
saves lives; results in less complex disaster recoveries; and helps
break the cycle of disaster damage, rebuilding, and repeated damage.
But, if we, as a Nation, are going to help prepare our communities for
a future in which they continue to be tested by hazards, then we need
to invest in these communities before a disaster strikes.
One important way FEMA is working to achieve this goal is through
our suite of grant programs. Our hazard mitigation assistance programs
provide critical funding to state, local, tribal, and territorial
governments to invest in cost effective activities that build a
community's resilience while lowering future disaster costs. Across our
programs, we continue to see oversubscription, or more applications
submitted than funding is available each year, as communities
increasingly seek to use FEMA's grants to help mitigate risks, build
operational capabilities, and save lives.
For example, through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, FEMA
administers funding to develop hazard mitigation plans and retrofit in
a way that reduces the impacts of future disaster losses in communities
following a presidentially declared disaster. We also have $185 million
available for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 for the Rehabilitation of High
Hazard Potential Dams program, which provides technical, planning,
design, and construction assistance for eligible dams, and another $26
million in FY 2024 through the National Dam Safety State Assistance
Grant Program to provide assistance to states for strengthening their
dam safety programs.
FEMA also provides capitalization grants for hazard mitigation
projects through the Safeguarding Tomorrow Revolving Loan Fund program,
which states, Tribes, and territories can use to finance projects to
reduce their risks from natural hazards and disasters. These revolving
loan funds can be used as the required local cost share for FEMA's
other grant programs. Implementation of this program is helping
eliminate barriers that small, rural, and other communities with
limited capacity may face when seeking mitigation funding.
The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC)
program is one of FEMA's flagship grant programs and is designed to
help communities increase their resilience to disasters and save lives.
For the FY 2022 grant cycle, where FEMA announced the largest BRIC NOFO
ever of $2.3 billion, FEMA selected 50 states, 35 Tribal Nations, 4
territories, and the District of Columbia to receive BRIC funding,
pending the outcome of the final review process. For example, an FY
2022 BRIC project in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana will help harden power
infrastructure to protect residents, essential businesses, and
emergency service providers from hurricane-force winds, as well as
upgrade poles and wire to withstand 150-mph winds and lightning
strikes. As a result, the project should decrease the risk of power
outages to residents and critical facilities. Meanwhile, the FY23 grant
application cycle, which made $1 billion available in funding, received
1,233 BRIC subapplications across all 50 states, 35 Tribal Nations, 5
territories and the District of Columbia, requesting more than $5.6
billion in project funding.
Recently, FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security announced
more than $1.8 billion in funding for eight FY 2024 preparedness grant
programs, including $373.5 million through the State Homeland Security
Program and $13.5 million to eligible Tribal Nations through the Tribal
Homeland Security Grant Program. Our preparedness grants provide
critical funding to help state, local, Tribal, and territorial
officials prepare for, prevent, protect against, and respond to acts of
terrorism and other hazards. For the State Homeland Security Program
specifically, this funding can be used to support the acquisition of
basic lifesaving skills that can be employed to assist others in a
critical incident, including multi-casualty and terrorism-based events.
Additionally, the Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant Program
provides resources to close known capability gaps in housing and
logistics and supply chain management; encourage innovative regional
solutions to catastrophic incidents; and build on existing regional
efforts.
As FEMA continues to administer this critical funding, the agency
is also working to innovate and improve these and other programs to
better increase all-hazards resilience across our Nation. We are
currently implementing changes to accelerate the grant award process,
the impact of capacity building, and other streamlined methods for our
grant programs.
Through the FY 2023 BRIC application cycle, FEMA saw an increase in
requests for BRIC Direct Technical Assistance (BRIC DTA), with 164
submissions--28 of which were from federally recognized Tribal Nations
and 136 communities across all 10 FEMA regions. Through BRIC DTA, FEMA
provides tailored support to communities and tribal nations that may
not have the resources to begin resilience planning and project
solution design on their own. FEMA has already announced a total of 74
communities and Tribal Nations selected from previous grant cycles, and
the agency is expecting to make at least 80 more selections from these
submissions. Recognizing that the development of up-to-date building
codes is among the most efficient and cost-effective ways to safeguard
our communities, FEMA also established a new set-aside funding
opportunity--the Building Code Plus-Up--for the FY 2023 BRIC Grant
cycle. We received $52 million in applications, which is the largest
amount of BRIC funding ever requested from FEMA for building codes.
Aligning with the Administration's National Initiative to Advance
Building Codes, the BRIC Building Code Plus-Up dedicates funding
exclusively to all states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories,
and federally recognized Tribal Nations to support building code
activities. Moreover, FEMA has established streamlined cost-
effectiveness determination methods for some hazard mitigation projects
and project types. Using one of these methods fulfills the cost-
effectiveness requirement if the project meets applicable criteria.
FEMA is also working to bolster the resilience of our partners
through the establishment of Community Disaster Resilience Zones
(CDRZ). In September 2023, FEMA announced the first 483 CDRZ's in all
50 states and the District of Columbia. CDRZ designations will leverage
collaboration and cross-sector coordination across all levels of
government, philanthropic foundations, private non-profits,
universities, the insurance industry, and other private businesses to
assist our most at-risk communities in building resilience against
natural hazards and extreme weather events.
Lastly, FEMA manages a network of training and education partners
providing learning solutions to address preparedness gaps in
communities across the country. The National Domestic Preparedness
Consortium is our premier partnership that offers over 190 FEMA
training courses to emergency managers, first responders, and local
leaders.
As we look to the challenges ahead, FEMA looks forward to working
with the Members of this Subcommittee to mitigate hazards and build a
more resilient nation. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I look
forward to answering your questions.

Mr. Perry. Well, thank you very much for your testimony. We
are going to turn to questions now. The Chair is going to turn
to himself.
I am curious. FEMA, says so right in the name, right, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. Emergency, right? So, I am
looking at this publication: ``FEMA Economic Benefit Values for
Green Infrastructure.'' ``Benefit Values for Green
Infrastructure,'' under FEMA, July 2022. And I see in here,
under green infrastructure benefit categories, one of the
benefits is property value improvement, for, I guess--well,
this is one of the--this is one of the things we are striving
for. And I am wondering, are heat islands, is that an
emergency? I guess this is mitigation, when you are talking
about planting trees, right, urban trees here, I see. And we
will get into the questioning about the value of that. But is
that an emergency? And how much money are we spending on that?
Ms. Salinas. We are, through our Hazard Mitigation Grant
Program, and our portfolio of grants, helping communities
reduce the risks that they face. And so, there are a number of
eligible types of projects across our hazard mitigation grant
portfolio.
As you well know, many of our grant programs have a cost-
effectiveness requirement. So, from the very get-go, when
communities apply, we are looking at the benefit cost of the
programs and projects that are being requested as part of the
vetting before any funding is given to projects.
Mr. Perry. So, I get that. I guess, among other things,
when I look at urban trees, I see the total benefit, if you
talk about things including property value improvement,
stormwater volume and quality, the benefit is $1,055.19. And,
of course, it is all broken down here. But I do wonder, and I
think the people paying the taxes wonder, how you derive that
benefit, number one. Well, maybe not number one. Number one is,
how is this an emergency? Like an emergency is something--you
think about a disaster. I mean, if you live at certain places,
flooding is probably an issue that you can anticipate.
Hurricanes might be an anticipated emergency, wildfires, you
can go through the list of things.
Heat island. Well, let me ask you this. How is FEMA
mitigating emergencies and disasters by planting trees?
Ms. Salinas. FEMA's mission is to help people before,
during, and after disasters. And reducing disaster risk is one
of the most critical ways that we help save lives, protect
property, and ensure that communities can recover quickly after
disasters.
The types of events that communities are facing is changing
dramatically. We are seeing heat domes, we are seeing
wildfires, we are seeing flood following fire, a whole range of
types of disasters. And the approaches to reducing disaster
risk are varied.
For instance, you have brought up trees and nature-based
solutions. We are seeing that, in communities across the
country, that there is a differential in heat depending on the
topography. And so, there are many communities that are seeking
to really cool down neighborhoods because each year, even this
last year, there were several hundred deaths because of extreme
heat. And so, that's one of the emerging hazards.
Mr. Perry. Do we know, ma'am, can you quantify how many
deaths have been averted by planting these trees?
Ms. Salinas. In the cost-benefit analysis----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. Do people stand out underneath
the tree? What do they do? What's happening?
Ms. Salinas. With many of the solutions that really rely on
nature, mother nature to protect and support communities, we
have seen in different types of projects that the benefits are
many. And as I mentioned----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. I get that, and I wish you could
quantify some of them. My time is quickly running out. We have
talked a lot and said nothing, I think, unfortunately. We want
the results. Show me some results to any of this.
I see that also we are spending a boatload of money in
Puerto Rico on sustainable energy, and I saw the list of people
that were involved in putting the program together. But I
didn't see anybody there to talk about the fact that the last
two hurricanes had sustained winds of 180 and 175--max
sustained winds, 180 and 175 miles per hour. I have a study
here that shows the impact on solar panels begins at 56 miles
per hour, and that's not to mention hail.
I will ask that this be entered into the record, this
study.

Severe Weather Can Have Long-Term Impact on Solar Generation: NREL
Events such as hail or high winds can have a lasting impact on solar
panels' productivity, an NREL study found.

Dive Brief:

Solar panels that have been subjected to severe weather
events produce about 1% less energy per year after these events,
according to a new study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Although the immediate impact of a single event is
relatively small, the effects could accumulate over time to represent
more sizable losses for owners of large fleets of solar panels,
according to Dirk Jordan, a distinguished researcher at NREL and an
author of the study.

Given the increased frequency of severe weather, solar
manufacturers--and utilities--may want to consider more stringent
standards for solar panel durability to avoid future losses, Jordan
said.
Dive Insight:
Solar generation--and especially solar plus storage--is generally a
good source of backup power in the aftermath of extreme weather events,
Jordan said. But severe weather can have a long-term impact on the
productivity of solar systems that increases with each severe weather
event, according to new NREL research.
Each episode of severe weather decreases a solar installation's
annual productivity by about 1% on average, according to the study, so
a solar system that is subjected to multiple severe weather events
could take heavy losses over time as a result. Previous research by
NREL indicates that productivity of the average solar installation
declines by about .75% per year, with solar panels in warm climates
experiencing more rapid aging than those in cooler climates.
``It sounds small, and maybe it is if only one system is
impacted,'' Jordan said, ``but if you are an owner with a fleet of
5,000 systems and many megawatts that are impacted, it could represent
a lot of money.''
NREL's analysis also points to a possible need for more stringent
testing of solar panels, Jordan said. For example, his team's analysis
determined that hail begins to have long-term impacts on solar output
when it exceeds about 1 inch in diameter. The current industry standard
calls for solar panels to be stress-tested for impact by hail of up to
1 inch. But given the increased frequency of severe hail across the
country, Jordan said this standard may not adequately protect against
lasting damage.
Jordan said he also had concerns about trends such as using larger
modules with thinner front-side glass panels in utility-scale solar
installations, as these modules may be more susceptible to weather-
related damages.
The study also found that high wind events cause lasting damage to
solar panels beginning at about 56 miles per hour, and that heavy
snowfall may cause long-term damage beginning at depths of 1 meter, or
a little over three feet.
These impacts aren't uniform across all impacted panels, Jordan
said. Some panels, for example, might be sheltered from high winds by
trees or buildings. Or poor installation or component quality could
cause certain panels to be more susceptible to weather-related
productivity losses.
The study didn't differentiate between residential and utility-
scale solar installations, and wasn't able to explore the specific
reasons why severe weather caused long-term productivity losses, said
Kirsten Perry, a data scientist on NREL's PV reliability and
performance team. She said NREL hopes to parse these issues and expand
the dataset to include other kinds of natural disasters, such as
heatwaves and wildfires, in future research.

Mr. Perry. It just seems to me we are just blowing money
that we don't have while FEMA asks for more.
And then finally, I look at the distribution of the BRIC
funds State ranking. I have DC here with three disaster
declarations, including inauguration, like that's an emergency
we didn't see coming, apparently. Meanwhile, you have
Mississippi with 21. DC is way up here, getting all this money.
Mississippi is way down here, getting none of this money.
That's an issue, ma'am, that needs to be resolved.
But I see my time has expired. So, I am going to yield my
time and recognize the gentlelady from Nevada, Ms. Titus, the
ranking member.
Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Just a couple of things. When you're talking about
measuring the results of mitigation, it's harder to measure
something that doesn't happen than it is to measure something
that does happen. And the purpose of mitigation is to keep
things from happening. So, it's not just so easy to come with a
statistic that the chairman apparently is looking for.
Also, representing Las Vegas, in the sunniest, hottest,
driest State in the country, we have a great appreciation for
heat islands and the damage that can be done to a community, to
infrastructure, to individuals, to pets because of this extreme
heat. So, planting trees does make a big difference in an area
like that, and that can quickly lead to disaster. In some
areas, it leads to fire, like I said, death, kind of
devastation of a neighborhood. And so, we appreciate the
emphasis on some of these heat islands that apparently the
chairman doesn't have in Pennsylvania.
I did want to ask you, though--my glasses broke, so, I am
sorry--the BRIC Program was five times oversubscribed. I
mentioned that, and I think you may have mentioned it, too, and
that many of the applicants were first time--the first time
they had applied for one of these grants. I wonder if you could
tell us kind of how that has evolved, if it's oversubscribed,
what we can do. Do you need more funds? Would you just go into
a little more detail about that program?
And having so many applicants seems to me to be one
indicator that it must be successful because people want to be
part of it.
Ms. Salinas. Absolutely. Thank you for that question. And
as you said, there has been a growing demand and realization
across this Nation of the need to take action and reduce risk.
Part of that has been the well-studied return on investment
that hazard mitigation has, and our ongoing commitment to
ensuring that all of the projects are cost effective. And we
are seeing that many communities are becoming first-time
applicants. And we have been working very closely with them to
be able to better access our programs.
Some of those concrete things we are doing are dismantling
the barriers to access Federal funding. So, for instance, over
the last couple of years, not only have we streamlined language
in our notices of funding, we have become much more proactive
in how we provide support. So, you heard me mention direct
technical assistance. The number of communities we are helping
with that means that many of those are starting to now access
competitive grants that they couldn't have accessed before.
We have also been providing and changing requirements
around the support we give to low-income communities for
conducting benefit-cost analysis, again, which is a requirement
for all of our programs. It used to be an impediment, a
barrier. People had to hire contractors in some cases. And
because we recognize that low-income communities and rural
areas, Tribal nations, and others could not necessarily do
that, we have been providing more direct support. And we are
seeing the results of that in the application numbers. The
number of first-time applicants, the communities that feel like
they can now move forward and take action on their risk is
growing both for the hazard mitigation grant portfolio, but
also our nonprofit security grant and our other preparedness
programs.
And so, there is certainly a pent-up demand by communities
across this Nation to be prepared, to be ready, to reduce risk,
and prevent the preventable.
Ms. Titus. Thank you. In some of the smaller communities,
you find that they don't have a technical grant writer. It's
kind of like, well, you're not busy, how about filling out this
grant for us? And now, in this very competitive world, that is
just not going to cut it. they are not going to be able to get
the resources that they may need or even know that they are out
there. So, when you talk about technical assistance, does that
help with hiring grant writers? Tell us a little bit more about
those things.
Ms. Salinas. Absolutely. Through the technical assistance
we provide, there are a number of things that we are doing. And
it is also many of our grant programs, like the Hazard
Mitigation Grant Program, have management costs that States can
use for the non-Federal capacity they need to build. And so,
there are certainly different avenues through our programs to
build that capacity that is needed.
And the other thing that we are doing is making sure that--
you mentioned, ma'am, the Community Disaster Resilience Zones
legislation that had bipartisan support. It is also enabling us
and other Federal agencies to really prioritize those places
that are most at risk and most in need and provide even more
proactive customer service and support to those communities to
navigate both FEMA funding and other funding that will help
them address their resilience issues. And so, it is a
multifaceted approach. These communities are facing complex,
interwoven challenges. We saw it last summer in DC. We had
extreme heat, but Canada's wildfire smoke. This is a new world
that we are living in with really interrelated hazards and
communities are wanting to tackle that holistically.
Ms. Titus. They don't just stop at the border, do they, the
problems? Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady. The Chair now
recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana, Representative Graves.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank
you very much for being here today.
I am trying to understand how you prioritize. Louisiana
submitted 113 BRIC project requests before they received the
first one. And I want to make note, they received the first one
in year 3.
I was actually very involved, working with then-Chairman
Shuster and with DeFazio, in establishing BRIC. I couldn't be
more supportive of mitigation and resiliency efforts when they
make sense, which I think is what our chairman was getting to.
Louisiana is one of the most at-risk States in the Nation.
I hear administration officials coming down to Louisiana and
talking about sea rise and our risk all the time. It is very
difficult for me to understand how it took 3 years and 113
project submissions before we get our first one. And then
Washington, DC, is getting one of the highest allocations in
the country.
This, I will tell you, wasn't the intent of the program.
And I am just struggling with understanding how this possibly
could be fair.
Ms. Salinas. Thank you so much, sir, for that question. And
I share your concern for the risks that Louisiana and other
States and coastal communities are facing. And for your
question around BRIC in particular, it is one of our
competitive grant programs, right? As you know, Louisiana--we
have a suite of grant programs, including the Hazard Mitigation
Grant Program, which a State administers directly.
And with BRIC, part of it is a State set-aside, so every
single State gets a portion that they can use as they see fit
for their priorities. The other portion has been competitive.
And that is where we continue to iterate and improve how we
look at that so that every State--and one will see it in the
numbers last year--every State will get----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. I hear you. I hear
you. But I guess it's really difficult for me to understand how
to reconcile the two things, that we are the most impacted
State and sea rise is going to destroy our State, and climate
is going to ruin our future, yet we are getting no recognition.
And so, under FEMA's strategic plan, they list three goals.
And I think that this is really the crux of why we are seeing
these distorted allocations. FEMA talks about trying to address
equity, climate resilience, and FEMA readiness. Can you tell me
where in the Stafford Act those three things are?
Ms. Salinas. Our strategic goals and our strategic plan are
aimed at better helping us deliver on our mission----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. Hang on. I just
want to make sure you understand the question.
Can you tell me where in the Stafford Act those three
objectives are?
Ms. Salinas. The Stafford Act requires FEMA to provide our
support without any discrimination. And these goals help us
achieve that----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. I appreciate your
answer. It is not answering the question, though.
Are those three things in the Stafford Act?
Ms. Salinas. The Stafford Act requires us to deliver our
support without discrimination. And these goals are how we
operationalize that.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. I am going to ask you to stop. So,
you are not answering my question, and I think we both
understand the answer is, no, these are not in the Stafford
Act.
And so, what this does is it results in distorted outcomes.
Look, this is what I did for a living and committed much of my
life to resilience of communities. Louisiana has lost 2,000
square miles of our coast. It's like wiping the State of Rhode
Island off the map.
If you come in and you use bad metrics that don't consider
all of the risk, you are going to result in bad outcomes. You
are going to miss opportunities.
Look, I will agree with you, climate is a risk, it is a
threat. It is not the only one. And if we continue to sit there
and myopically focus on it, we are going to miss opportunities
to result in better outcomes, more resilient communities. And I
think it's a very dangerous trajectory that FEMA is going down
right now.
I want to ask you another question. How do you consider
Risk Rating 2.0 and that methodology in how you prioritize
grants under the BRIC Program?
Ms. Salinas. The Risk Rating 2.0 has been the way that we
now have actuarially sound pricing to make sure that--for our
National Flood Insurance Program----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. I am familiar with
what it is. How do you factor it in?
Ms. Salinas. As I mentioned, we have a portfolio of
programs, and those two are not interrelated. But what I would
like to mention----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. So, I am running
out of time. I apologize for cutting you off, but I just want
to make sure. So, that is not, that methodology, that criteria
is not used to prioritize mitigation grants?
Ms. Salinas. The BRIC Program does not use Risk Rating 2.0.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. OK, thank you. I am just trying to
understand that. I want to make sure I did.
So, lastly, does that mean that the mitigation investments
you make are totally separate from the Risk Rating 2.0
methodology, to where if you make investments, it is very
possible that flood insurance rates don't even go down, because
there is a complete disconnect between the two?
Ms. Salinas. Communities through our programs are
addressing their most important disaster risks. And in
Louisiana, for instance, the Flood Mitigation Assistance
Program----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. I am sorry, I am
out of time. Is that a yes or a no?
Ms. Salinas. Our programs reduce disaster risk, and they
reduce disaster flooding.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Will it lower rates? Will it lower
rates?
Ms. Salinas. When communities take action to reduce flood
risk, it does have an impact through the community rating
system on lowering the policy premiums.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. I yield back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The Chair now
recognizes the ranking member of the full committee.
Representative Larsen, 5 minutes.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
So, the Disaster Relief Fund is expected to run out
sometime this August. Is that correct?
Ms. Salinas. Yes, sir. Thank you for that question----
Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. So, if that
happens, the Agency may be then forced to implement Immediate
Needs Funding again this summer, if Congress does not pass the
supplemental?
Ms. Salinas. This administration submitted a $9 billion
supplemental request last year to address that estimated
shortfall in the Disaster Relief Fund, and I fully support that
request, as it will allow us to maintain the capacity needed
for fiscal year 2024 levels and ensure we can fulfill our
mission.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. So, what is the short-term impact
to hazard mitigation projects from FEMA having to implement the
Immediate Needs Funding?
Ms. Salinas. For the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, like
the Public Assistance Program, when we are in Immediate Needs
Funding, the focus is life safety. And that means that
obligations flow down to those communities that are in active
recoveries and investing in their resilience, which has
trickle----
Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. Can I put that in
English, perhaps, for you? It's a lot of FEMA talk and
bureaucracy talk. What it will mean is that some projects that
were slated to get funding otherwise----
Ms. Salinas [interrupting]. Will be delayed.
Mr. Larsen of Washington [continuing]. Will not get
funding.
Ms. Salinas. They will be delayed.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Right, immediately will not get
funding. They will be delayed until, presumably, until there is
a supplemental.
Ms. Salinas. Until there is a supplemental.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. So, we will be in a position
where we were sometime last year? We went through this circus
last year; is that right?
Ms. Salinas. We were in a situation of Immediate Needs
Funding last year as well, where payments had to be slowed
because of the focus on life safety until there was a
supplemental.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. And there is no way to get around
that, from FEMA's perspective?
Ms. Salinas. As the administration has requested, the
approach for addressing the health of the Disaster Relief Fund
is the $9 billion supplemental request that was submitted last
year.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Got it. So, moving a little bit,
the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program recipients are allowed to
use a percentage of the funding they receive to manage that
grant. So, hearing from the emergency management folks in my
State, and presumably others, it takes a while to receive that
funding. So, they are essentially managing the grant on their
own costs, as opposed to being able to pay for that management.
And delays in determining the amount of that funding that will
be provided may be causing a backlog of projects at FEMA. So,
what is FEMA doing to work with our States to streamline that
process, ensure State and locals can access those grant and
management funds in a more timely manner?
Ms. Salinas. I, like you, am eager to see these grants
awarded and to see shovels in the ground. That is a priority
for us all. And we are----
Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. It's usually
backhoes, but yes. It's usually backhoes.
Ms. Salinas. Backhoes. We are making progress, and we are
expecting to see the pace of the awards continue to increase in
the near future. And so, there are many things we are doing to
get those grants out the door faster, from working with
stakeholders more efficiently and transparently, promoting
consistent decisions and awards, supporting our regions to
facilitate that back and forth whenever information is needed,
and to simplify our cost-effectiveness methods. And so, these
are all things, given the extreme need, that we have been doing
to really deliver the programs more effectively. And as I
mentioned earlier, management costs are one of those things
that States really rely on to be able to build the capacity
they need to deliver on the projects funded.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, it is pretty critical,
because the States are the ones with their locals who are
really doing the work here. So, if you can continue to focus on
that, I would appreciate it.
Given the critical nature of mitigation projects in
communities at risk for disasters, it is important that these
grants for projects are provided. Have you looked at the
average length of time from award to receiving the funding for
BRIC grants and for Hazard Mitigation Grant Program grants?
Ms. Salinas. Sorry, can you repeat the question?
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Have you had a look at the time,
the average length of time, from award to receiving the grants
for BRIC and for HMGP?
Ms. Salinas. The timeline for the different grant programs
varies. And our big focus is trying to expedite and tighten
those timeframes from selection to review to award to
implementation, because that is where we see the change in the
world.
And for the BRIC Programs, many of the projects that have
been submitted are transformational in nature, and so, they are
larger scale projects and have more complexity to the review
process before they can actually get built.
Other projects are sometimes very small. We mentioned the
STORM Revolving Loan Fund earlier. That is able to fund a lot
of smaller dollar, $5 million and less projects really quickly
because there is less complexity. So, we have many different
project types that are eligible across our programs, given the
needs of communities vary. And the timeline oftentimes is very
much woven in the type and complexity of the project a
community is trying to undertake.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. That's fine. Thank you. I yield
back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman from Washington.
The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi,
Representative Ezell.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Ms.
Salinas, for being here today discussing these very important
matters.
I grew up in south Mississippi, on the Mississippi gulf
coast, and unfortunately that is a hot spot for hurricanes. And
I will say that I have policed every hurricane in south
Mississippi since 1979. And during my time as a sheriff there,
I helped many communities try to recover from some of these
events. And when Katrina hit, I ended up with 4 feet of mud and
water in my house, so, I understand.
The effect of FEMA's resiliency programs is critical for my
district. I would like to start with the grant program that I
think needs some improvement, the BRIC funding. Many studies
have shown that States on the gulf and in the Midwest have
struggled to receive some of the competitive portions of the
grant. ``Struggled'' may be a nice word, because as we heard
earlier, and I was going to bring this up anyway, Mississippi
has received no money from the program whatsoever. I think most
would agree that Mississippi is a hot spot for natural
disasters.
What steps is your Agency taking to ensure these funds are
distributed more evenly?
Ms. Salinas. Sir, thank you so much for your question. And
I know firsthand so many of the challenges Mississippi has been
facing. I was in Rolling Fork a couple years ago before the
tornadoes, focused on Mississippi River challenges with
flooding.
We have many different programs that are being used to
reduce disaster risk. And there is progress being made in
helping States and communities utilize them. Not only for BRIC,
as you asked about, have we seen every State now be able to
benefit in recent years and have projects selected. Through our
Swift Current Program, which is part of the Flood Mitigation
Assistance Program, we saw Mississippi in particular--it had
been since 2009 that Mississippi had not benefited from the
Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. But with Swift Current,
and the incredible partnership between the State of Mississippi
and our region 6 and headquarters colleagues, they were able to
access the new Swift Current to address flood risk issues in
the State.
And so, the point here is that there are many tools. BRIC
is one. It is competitive. There are the State set-asides. It
has a Tribal set-aside. But the Hazard Mitigation Grant
Program, the flood mitigation assistance, dam safety, there are
so many tools--STORM--that exist, that we are working to ensure
that communities and States and Tribes are accessing to meet
their unique needs.
Mr. Ezell. Do you believe the program is working as it was
intended to in allocating these funds to areas that have been
most affected by the disasters?
Ms. Salinas. For the BRIC Program? Or which one in
particular, sir? Sorry.
Mr. Ezell. The BRIC. Do you believe it has been working as
it was intended to?
Ms. Salinas. BRIC was conceived as an opportunity to do
more risk reduction before disasters occur. And we are seeing
so much risk across this Nation. And so, the criteria, the
approach to the competitive portion of BRIC is certainly
helping communities do those more transformational projects.
And the State set-asides are helping States and Tribal nations
for the Tribal set-aside do that work. We also doubled the
Tribal set-aside over the last couple of years to enable Tribal
nations to tackle their resilience issues as well.
Mr. Ezell. Many of the small, rural communities in my
district have told me they lack the resources to apply for
hazard mitigation grants. I understand FEMA recently hired a
small State and rural advocate. But beyond that, what is the
Agency doing to ensure rural communities have every opportunity
to participate in these programs?
Ms. Salinas. We, too, want to ensure that all communities,
rural communities included, are able to build and invest in
their resilience. And so, in addition to an advocate, our
programs like the BRIC Direct Technical Assistance Program are
helping many rural communities across this Nation, from the
South, all the way to rural Alaska, to address their resilience
needs.
In addition, FEMA is partnering very closely with the Rural
Partners Network, the training and education I mentioned
earlier. We have rural partners that deploy training for
emergency management and risk reduction to communities
themselves. And so, we have a comprehensive approach to
emergency management and resilience building that is inclusive
of the needs of rural communities. And like I said, we are
trying to systematically dismantle those barriers that
communities face, whether it's how to do a benefit-cost
analysis, whether it's hazard mitigation planning, all those
essential things. Our teams are building our capacity to enable
the State and local governments and the communities they serve
to invest in their resilience.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you for that. And just so you will know,
we are still struggling to recover some of the funds from
Katrina in 2005. And so, that just makes it even more difficult
for our towns when they are having to fork out a lot of money.
So, we need your help. So, let's get busy. Thank you.
Ms. Salinas. Thank you so much, sir.
Mr. Ezell. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady from the District
of Columbia, Representative Norton, for 5 minutes.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Ms. Salinas, climate change has fueled an alarming increase
in the number and severity of natural disasters across the
Nation. To better help communities prepare for the mitigation
of the climate crisis, FEMA established the first Community
Disaster Resilience Zones, including here in the District of
Columbia, which I represent. How will these zones help the
District of Columbia and other jurisdictions mitigate extreme
weather events?
Ms. Salinas. Thank you for that question, Representative.
We share a desire to see resilience built across this
Nation. And there are so many needs that prioritization and
working where there are the highest risk, highest need
communities is exactly what the Community Disaster Resilience
Zone Act called on FEMA to do, and what it is enabling us to do
in partnership with many others.
So, our intention with implementing the Community Disaster
Resilience Zones is to build resilience across this Nation in
those most at-risk places. This new program, we established the
first set of zones at the end of last year in every State and
the District of Columbia, as you mentioned. And it is enabling
us to do a couple of things.
Not only did the legislation call on a better cost share--
that has come up as a big barrier for many underserved and
rural communities. So, it is a 90-percent Federal share for
those projects, similar for all of the CDR Zones. It also
called on us to collaborate better with other Federal agencies.
And so, we are seeing other agencies use these resilience zones
as ways to prioritize technical assistance and grant funding,
so that together we are driving and supporting resilience
building in areas that it is most critical.
We are also partnering with other sectors. And so, it is a
great opportunity and a forcing function and a force multiplier
to see the private sector, philanthropy step in. And in the
Southeast United States, we have already seen certain
philanthropies begin working with local nonprofits and
universities to really support communities both better
understand the risks that they face, develop the plans needed
to tackle it, and then mobilize the funding for multiple
sectors to see those plans turn into concrete actions and
benefits for people and communities. So, it has been an
incredible opportunity that we give great gratitude for
Congress for that, for the bipartisan CDRZs legislation, as it
will certainly be a new tool and a way to make progress in this
Nation.
Ms. Norton. Thank you. The Building Resilient
Infrastructure and Communities Program funds billions of
dollars in pre-disaster mitigation projects at State and local
levels. These projects will help our local communities better
withstand extreme weather events.
How have BRIC grants helped my district--the District of
Columbia--and other jurisdictions become more resilient?
Ms. Salinas. The great opportunity that BRIC and our other
Hazard Mitigation Grant Programs have afforded communities is
an opportunity to really invest in what they see as critical.
So, even here in the District of Columbia, last year, I had an
opportunity to visit DC Water, providing many of us perhaps
sustainability in drinking water in our own homes, where flood
risk and natural disaster could create major challenges. And
the District of Columbia wanted to make sure there was energy
redundancy there. And so, BRIC helped contribute to that
project.
And so, around the Nation, we are seeing communities being
able to access these dollars to make sure their people are
safe, that critical lifelines don't fail, and that we are
preventing the preventable. Because particularly when we are
talking about natural hazards and disaster risk, there is much
we can do to prevent the human suffering that disasters cause,
and BRIC and our many other programs are part of that solution.
Ms. Norton. Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady.
The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Utah,
Representative Maloy, for 5 minutes.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Ms. Salinas, thank you for being here. I have been sitting
here listening. The nice thing about going last is that all the
questions I intend to ask always get asked before I get to ask
any questions. And so, I just want to follow up on some of the
things that have already been said.
I was looking at the Stafford Act this morning, and it does
say that one of the things FEMA is supposed to do, that
Congress has told FEMA to do, is encourage States, individuals,
and local governments to protect themselves. And then I am
sitting here listening. And what I am hearing instead of that
is flood insurance rates are prohibitively expensive and
Congress isn't privy to the methodologies that are used to
determine those rates. And success is being measured by how
many grant applications are being submitted.
Of course local governments are applying for Federal
dollars. They are always looking for more income streams. But I
don't think that is a measure of how successful the Agency is
being at meeting their mission and doing what Congress has
authorized them to do. At-risk areas are not getting the grants
they need, but Washington, DC, the seat of all bureaucracy, is
getting grants.
This feels like it's just an example of what's wrong with
bureaucracy. An Agency that exists to assist in disasters isn't
assisting the areas that have the most disasters. State and
local governments aren't getting the assistance they need to
protect themselves, which is one of the things that the Agency
is supposed to do. And rural areas, like a lot of my district,
aren't qualifying for assistance. So, some of the people who
are the least resilient and need the most help aren't
qualifying for it. And then we keep talking about an increase
in disasters, but the increase in disasters isn't resulting in
an increase in the quality of assistance, it's just creating
more bureaucracy.
And you have done a fairly heroic job here today of
defending the Agency and talking about what you are doing. But
I am not hearing answers that are satisfying to me as a Member
of Congress. We have oversight over the Agency, and we have a
responsibility to make sure that taxpayer dollars are being
used appropriately. And all I am hearing is an Agency that
keeps asking for more and more taxpayer dollars isn't giving
satisfying answers about how they are being used. And it seems
like it would be irresponsible for us to keep increasing
funding for these programs that aren't doing what they were
intended to do.
If my colleague, Mr. Graves, was still here, I would yield
the rest of my time back to him so he could follow up on the
line of questioning that he didn't get to finish. But I just
want to say, the most fundamental question we should be asking
in this kind of a hearing is why should taxpayers, in a Nation
that's drowning in debt, trust your Agency with more taxpayer
dollars? And I haven't heard a good answer to that question
during this hearing.
And if you want, I will give you a minute to try to answer
that. But it's going to have to be a different answer than what
I've already been hearing.
Ms. Salinas. Thank you so much, Representative. And we,
too, are committed to ensuring that taxpayer dollars are
building resilience across this Nation. And so, what we are
seeing is that the number of applications coming in far exceeds
the dollars that we have to invest. And there are a number of
ways that we are looking at ensuring the benefit and
streamlining support, because that is also key for us as well.
And so, across our programs, we have been reducing barriers
to applying. We have also been making sure that there is
technical support to many different types of communities to
access those dollars.
We also have been committed through lifting up great
practices and supporting communities in designing projects,
doing hazard mitigation planning, a whole suite of things that
really makes it easier to access those dollars. And that is one
of the fundamental steps, is reducing barriers.
The other is providing support in communities to help them
with the planning, both through BRIC DTA, through other
mechanisms, we do provide that direct support to communities to
be able to better leverage our dollars.
Ms. Maloy. I would hope in this kind of hearing, we would
hear a plan for how these disaster-prone areas are going to get
higher priority for the grant programs that exist, and some
actual concrete answers on what barriers are being broken down
for underserved areas, including rural areas, and not just that
you are doing it but some proof that it's working.
And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady.
The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from New York,
Representative D'Esposito.
Mr. D'Esposito. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and good
morning, Ms. Salinas.
So, I represent the southwest corner of Long Island. It's
an area that was not only crushed in Hurricane Sandy, but just
months prior to that, Tropical Storm Irene devastated it. I
remember days following Hurricane Sandy, there were homeowners
who still had the stickers on their appliances from replacing
them from Irene that were now flooded out during Sandy.
So, during that time in 2012, I served as chief of the
Island Park Fire Department. I was the incident commander
during Hurricane Sandy. And obviously, I know how critical
access to timely and sufficient funding was such a major
challenge to emergency managers throughout Long Island.
So, I know that there has been a program put in place, the
Safeguarding Tomorrow Revolving Loan Fund Program, which aims
to remove some of the barriers that communities face when
seeking mitigation funding. I know that it's a new program
started in 2021. And understanding that, with any Government
program, there is often bureaucracy and redtape, especially
when implementing a new program. And I was wondering if you can
just briefly explain and tell me how the implementation of this
program is going, and if you feel that it has been successful
thus far.
Ms. Salinas. Thank you so much sir, and great to see you
again.
Mr. D'Esposito. Same here.
Ms. Salinas. The STORM, our new revolving loan fund, is a
great new tool in the portfolio of our Hazard Mitigation
Assistance programs. And in the first round of STORM, we had
multiple jurisdictions, States apply for these revolving loan
dollars, requesting more dollars than we had actually put out
in the first notice of funding.
And so, we certainly--we have been taking a test and learn
approach, because we are really committed to ensuring we are
streamlining, reducing barriers, making our programs easier to
access. And so, there are certainly some lessons learned from
this first round of funding that we are taking into the second
round.
But we are seeing multiple States already begin to use the
STORM dollars. And some of those benefits that we are
particularly excited about is that the STORM dollars can be
used as match for Federal funds, because that is one of the
biggest barriers many communities face. It puts the cost-
effectiveness requirements on the State so that that part is
also easier for local governments and the States to manage on
their own.
So, the nimbleness of this new revolving loan fund will be
critical in addressing the many smaller dollar risk reduction
projects that make a huge impact in communities. So, a lot of
lessons learned coming, but it is one of those things where
this next round will be responsive to those changes that we
have seen and heard from stakeholders.
Mr. D'Esposito. And how have you done outreach to different
communities? I mean, obviously, whether you are from
Pennsylvania, from Utah, from New York, or anywhere else across
this country, the resources that are needed, although the
mission is the same when it comes to managing emergencies, very
often, those resources vary. So, how are you making sure that
you are connecting with emergency managers and municipalities
from throughout this country, not just in the big places like
New York City, but in the smaller communities so that they have
available the resources that they need in order to keep their
communities safe?
Ms. Salinas. Thank you. Connecting with a broad range of
stakeholders is key to mission success for us. And so, in the
numbers and even who is applying and first-time applicants, we
see success in that we are having many new entities apply for
funding. And that is due to very robust outreach that has taken
the form not just of traditional webinars and pushing out
information, but also proactive approaches.
We have been talking about grant programs today. But even
in our exercise and training programs that we offer to local
governments free of cost, we have been proactively reaching out
to say, you are a community that is perhaps in a Community
Disaster Resilience Zone. Have you taken advantage of this? Can
we help you use these programs more? And so, we are really
changing our own approach to be more proactive and using risk
information, using Community Disaster Resilience Zones
designations, and listening to where there is that need so that
we are proactively supporting communities to access the
resources they need. And so, it has been great to see the
changes in applications come in, as evidence of that outreach.
Mr. D'Esposito. And I only have a few seconds, but I just
want to leave you with one last thing. Obviously, during the
Biden administration, we have seen an obscene amount of
wasteful spending in this administration that's going to cost
our children and grandchildren for decades. I would just ask
that you please make sure that we keep an eye on duplication of
funds and wastefulness in this program. Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Perry. Thank you. The gentleman yields back.
Are there further questions from any members of the
subcommittee who have not yet been recognized?
[No response.]
Mr. Perry. Seeing none, that concludes our hearing for
today.
Administrator, we thank you for your testimony, your
timeliness, and your willingness to be here.
At that, this subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Letter of May 1, 2024, to Hon. Scott Perry, Chairman, and Hon. Dina
Titus, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public
Buildings, and Emergency Management, from AEC Science & Technology, LLC
et al., Submitted for the Record by Hon. Rick Larsen
May 1, 2024.
The Honorable Scott Perry,
Chairman,
Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency
Management, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC
20515.
The Honorable Dina Titus,
Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency
Management, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC
20515.
Dear Chairman Perry and Ranking Member Titus:
As the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and
Emergency Management considers the value of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's (FEMA) mitigation expenditures, we write to call
your attention to the well-documented return on investment that the
adoption and effective implementation of resilient building codes
provides as well as the longstanding bipartisan support that enabled
and encouraged FEMA to focus on these activities. The Subcommittee's
May 1st hearing is particularly timely as it marks the beginning of
Building Safety Month, an international public awareness effort to
highlight the importance of building safety professionals in ensuring
the resilience and safety of our built environment.
Numerous studies confirm that the adoption and implementation of
current model building codes is one of the best mitigation strategies
for lessening the impacts of natural hazards, including hurricanes and
flooding.\1\ \2\ \3\ \4\ \5\ The National Institute of Building
Sciences (NIBS)--a Congressionally chartered building science
organization--estimates that building to modern building codes saves
$11 dollars for every $1 dollar invested through earthquake, flood, and
wind mitigation benefits, while retrofitting 2.5 million homes in the
wildland urban interface to wildfire codes could provide a nationwide
benefit-cost ratio as high as $8 dollars for every $1 dollar
invested.\6\ FEMA projects that if all future construction adhered to
current model codes, the nation would avoid more than $600 billion
dollars in cumulative losses from floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes
by 2060.\7\ Three U.S. Department of Energy National Laboratories
recently found that during prolonged weather-induced power outages,
coupled with extreme heat or cold, current codes can reduce deaths due
to extreme heat by 80% and extreme cold by 30%.\8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition, contemporary research continues to find that modern
model building codes have no appreciable implications for housing
affordability \9\ \10\ \11\--in fact, no peer-reviewed research has
found otherwise. One study considering the role of government
regulation on home prices found that construction costs--including
labor and materials--were flat from 1980 to 2013, a period during which
construction codes were widely adopted and updated.\12\

\9\ Simmons, K. & Kovacs, P., Real Estate Market Response to
Enhanced Building Codes in Moore, OK, Investigative Journal of Risk
Reduction (Mar. 2018) (stronger building code had no effect on the
price per square foot or home sales).

Studies for Earthquake-Resistant Construction in Memphis, Tennessee,
NIST GCR 14-917-26 (2013) (adopting stronger codes would add less than
1-percent to the construction while reducing annualized loss--in terms
of repair cost, collapse probability, and fatalities--by approximately
50-percent).
\11\ Porter, K., Resilience-related building-code changes don't
affect affordability, SPA Risk LLC Working Paper Series 2019-01 (2019)

In recognition of their well-documented benefits, FEMA has
incentivized and encouraged the use of resilient codes at all levels of
government to ``increase the resilience of communities after a
disaster,'' ``protect lives and property,'' and to ``reduc[e] the need
for future Federal disaster recovery funding and other assistance.''
\13\ This approach transcends partisanship; it was significantly
advanced during the Trump Administration through FEMA \14\ as well as
within the Federal government's National Mitigation Investment
Strategy--developed by the Mitigation Framework Leadership Group
(MitFLG) \15\--and continues today.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEMA's efforts have similarly, and consistently, received
bipartisan support from Congress. The most comprehensive update to
FEMA's natural hazards response and recovery authorities, the Robert T.
Stafford Act Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 93-288,
as amended), in the last decade was drafted and advanced by Republican
leadership in the U.S. House and Senate. That legislation, the Disaster
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2018 (Div. D of P.L. 115-254), for the
first time authorized FEMA to provide grants pre-disaster to assist
communities in adopting, updating, and enforcing resilient building
codes.\16\ Congress' doing so sensibly expanded FEMA's preexisting
post-disaster support for these same activities, which FEMA has
supported since the 1990s. These activities principally support the
evaluation and mitigation of existing risk to the built environment
through experts, community engagement, and training. Recognizing that
some jurisdictions have adopted stronger codes than those adopted at
the state level, FEMA's Fiscal Year 2023 Building Resilient
Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) grant program incentivizes both
state and local adoption and implementation of hazard-resistant codes
in making mitigation project awards.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\16\ Compare H.R. 4460 (committee-passed), 115th Cong. (2018)
(authoring grants ``to establish and carry out enforcement activities
to implement the latest published editions of relevant consensus-based
codes, specifications, and standards that incorporate the latest
hazard-resistant designs''), with H.R. 302 (enacted), 115th Cong.
(2018) (``to establish and carry out enforcement activities and
implement the latest published editions of relevant consensus-based
codes, specifications, and standards that incorporate the latest
hazard-resistant designs'') (clarifying that grants can support both
the adoption and enforcement of resilient codes).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We welcome the Subcommittee's review of FEMA's mitigation
leadership and encourage continued bipartisan support for the
development, adoption, and effective implementation of resilient
building codes and standards.

Questions to Victoria Salinas, Senior Official Performing the Duties of
Deputy Administrator, Office of Resilience, Federal Emergency
Management Agency, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, from Hon.
Scott Perry

Question 1. Over the past five fiscal years, FEMA has obligated
more than $9.5 billion in mitigation funding, which includes funding
through Public Assistance, the Building Resilient Infrastructure and
Communities (BRIC) program, the Hazard Mitigation Grant (HMGP) program,
and the Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) Grant program.
Question 1.a. In your estimation, what percentage of that money has
been drawn down?
Answer. For the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities
(BRIC) program, the Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA), and Hazard
Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), and their legacy programs, we estimate
roughly 27 percent of a $6.4B total funds obligated has been drawn down
in the last five years as of May 2024. FEMA Is unable to report Public
Assistance (PA) Mitigation funds drawn down as an isolated figure from
other PA grants.

Question 1.b. Once a mitigation project has been approved by FEMA,
what is the average amount of time it takes for a project to be
completed?
Answer. The average timeline for project completion and closeout
for BRIC, FMA, and HMGP programs from the date of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) approval varies widely depending on the
project type, ranging from, for example, 35 months for Generator
projects, to 52 months for Saferooms and Wind Shelters. A common issue
we most see which can impact project timelines is:

Capacity of our applicants--HMA project applicants often
need to spend time and effort pulling together the resources they
need--whether in administrative, planning, or personnel costs, to
adequately prepare and execute a project plan.

Question 1.c. How much of that time is spent waiting for an
Environmental and Historic Preservation review?
Answer. Since the Environmental and Historic Preservation (EHP)
review is completed prior to the award/obligation, there is no
additional time associated with the EHP review post award.

Question 2. In Fiscal Year 2020, the first year that BRIC funding
was available, FEMA received 991 subapplications for funding. Of those
subapplications, 406 were selected for further review.
Question 2.a. How many of those subapplications were eventually
funded?
Answer. As of April 30, 2024, 86 percent (351) of Fiscal Year (FY)
2020 BRIC subapplications received an initial obligation. Of the
remaining subapplications, 6.9 percent (28) were pending an initial
obligation, and 7.1 percent (29) had been withdrawn by the Applicant.
FEMA and BRIC Applicants are making progress towards implementing the
vast majority of subapplications and are in line with historic
obligation trends for FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) grants.
However, there are still 28 FY 2020 BRIC subapplications that have yet
to receive an initial obligation. Often these delays are seen in
infrastructure projects that have multi-year implementation timelines,
complex EHP compliance pre-award work, and/or permitting processes to
complete prior to implementation.
FEMA is focused on working with Applicants to complete pre-award
work so that awards can be made and work started. In support of this,
FEMA is putting more resources into Regional Offices to work through
prioritized subapplications and move them closer to award.

Question 2.b. To date, how many of those projects have been
completed?
Answer. BRIC seeks to fund transformational projects that are
generally multi-year in nature and provide communities the opportunity
to transform their risk profile and make investments to increase their
resilience in the face of increasing hazards and climate change. Often
times, these types of projects require significant time to complete
feasibility reviews, clear the EHP review process, and position the
project for award, construction, and ultimately project closeout.
Although, FEMA has not completed closeout for any FY 2020 BRIC
grants, which is the final step of project completion, it is estimated
that approximately 25 percent of subgrants are nearly complete. For
context, the FY 2020 BRIC application period closed on January 29,
2021, and selections were announced on July 1, 2021. Each grant had a
period of performance of at least three years, with FEMA having the
ability to provide extensions.

Question 2.c. When do you estimate that the remaining Fiscal Year
2020 BRIC projects will be completed?
Answer. For the remaining FY 2020 BRIC projects, we can only
estimate the remaining time to complete these projects based on
historic averages. Historically, FEMA HMA projects take on average 48
months from the date of project approval to grant closeout. This
includes the standard 36 months allowed for project completion, with a
12 month extension. This figure varies widely depending on project
type. Numerous factors such as scope, complexity, geographic location,
and timeframe have impacts on the completion of an individual project.
For example, capability and capacity building projects may be
completed more quickly than infrastructure projects.
FEMA and Applicants work together throughout the pre-award stage to
move projects forward and get construction started. This requires
strong coordination between FEMA and Applicants, as well as between
Applicants and Subapplicants to ensure the project satisfies all
requirements and can be awarded and then move through the construction
phase in a timely manner.
FEMA is working with Applicants to complete Requests for
Information (RFI) and other pre-award activities to obligate funds as
quickly as possible. To help expedite this part of the process,
additional resources are being provided to FEMA regions to target
prioritized projects for obligation in pursuit of completing projects.
FEMA also works closely with applicants through the EHP compliance
review process. During this phase, projects are reviewed to determine
the potential effects on the environment and historic properties to
ensure all activities funded by FEMA comply with Federal EHP
regulations, laws, and Executive Orders. The EHP review must be
completed before funds are obligated. Infrastructure and other projects
involving construction with the potential to impact natural or cultural
resources will be on the longer end of the review timeline , while
other funded subapplications for capability and capacity building
activities are generally shorter in timeframes to obligate funds.

Question 3. FEMA has consistently highlighted that the BRIC program
is oversubscribed. For example, in the Fiscal Year 2022 grant cycle,
FEMA made $2.3 billion in funding available, but received applications
for more than $4.6 billion in funding.
Does FEMA make all the potential BRIC funding available each year,
or does FEMA hold back some funding each grant cycle? Please describe
the rationale for FEMA's decision.
Answer. With the BRIC Program, FEMA has always worked to best
balance funding communities' resilience goals with long-term stability
of the program. Relative consistency on amount of dollars available
year-after-year for the BRIC program allows for communities to make
long-term investments in reducing not only their current risk, but also
their future risks to natural disasters. The funding level made
available each year accounts for both the need to continue to build
momentum in addressing a portion of the unmet mitigation needs, with
reserving funding from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) set-aside to
continue to make resilience investments for communities.
Section 203(i) of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. Sec.  5133(i))
authorizes FEMA to fund BRIC activities under section 203 by setting
aside from the DRF, with respect to each major disaster, an amount
equal to 6 percent of the estimated aggregate amount of grants for
major disaster assistance under the Stafford Act. This authority is
discretionary and does not include a specific methodology to be used
when calculating the estimated aggregate amount of disaster grant
funding. FEMA implements this authority using a methodology determined
to be appropriate by FEMA's Office of the Chief Financial Officer that
manages the health of the DRF and addresses stakeholder feedback
requesting consistency in funding levels year to year. The
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or better known as the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) appropriated an additional $1
billion for BRIC, with $200 million in each fiscal year from 2022 until
2026. FEMA has announced the additional $200 million each fiscal year
in addition to the BRIC funding set aside as a result of disaster
activity.

Question 4. It is my understanding that FEMA mitigation funding has
been going to projects that utilize terms like ``nature based-
solutions'' or ``climate resistant.'' Furthermore, in the past FEMA
funds have been used to plant trees to allegedly address ``heat
islands.''
When it comes to the benefit-cost analysis, how does FEMA determine
the numbers assigned as pre-calculated benefits for mitigating against
things like heat islands?
Answer. Pre-calculated benefits are a streamlined methodology where
FEMA calculated pre-determined cost-effectiveness, eliminating the
requirement for a separate benefit-cost analysis (BCA). Pre-calculated
benefits are values that FEMA calculates based on research and
statistical analysis or computer modeling of hazard mitigation
projects.
Currently, FEMA does not have pre-calculated benefits for
addressing heat islands. Heat mitigation projects must be cost-
effective and applicants or FEMA complete a full benefit-cost analysis
to ensure compliance.

Questions to Victoria Salinas, Senior Official Performing the Duties of
Deputy Administrator, Office of Resilience, Federal Emergency
Management Agency, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, from Hon. Rick
Larsen

Question 1. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 included a provision
requiring FEMA to increase the Public Assistance federal cost share for
states that have implemented hazard mitigation measures including the
enforcement of hazard resistant building codes and funding mitigation
projects. This law creates a great incentive for states to proactively
fund mitigation measures. This provision, however, still has not been
implemented.
In 2023 responses submitted for the hearing record, FEMA committed
to implementing this provision in the calendar year 2024. Can you
confirm that timeline?
Answer. FEMA remains committed to implementing this provision.

Question 2. Do FEMA's regional offices have the staff necessary to
support the obligation of mitigation grants given the substantial
increase in funding for such grants in recent years?Do all regions have
dedicated staff working on mitigation grants? If not, are there plans
to hire additional full-time staff in the regions?
Answer. FEMA and our Applicants greatly appreciate the historic
increases in funding for much-needed investments in resilience
nationwide. Through the BIL, signed into law in November 2021, Congress
appropriated $6.8 billion to FEMA to further the agency's resilience
efforts through the funding of five programs. This law is a once-in-a-
generation investment which provided additional funding for each FY
until 2026. Given the temporary nature of this funding and to ensure
the expedited delivery of this assistance to communities, FEMA has been
working with HQ and Regional Offices nationwide to increase the number
of staff to support HMA program through additional hiring of 4-year
temporary full time (TFT) employees. Currently, FEMA has hired more
than 200 TFT and Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery Employees (CORE)
staff to support and expedite the additional BIL funding at
Headquarters and the Regions. Each FEMA Region has dedicated staff
working on HMA grant programs. In addition to positions paid for out of
BIL,since 2019 FEMA has increased both permanent (Operations and
Support) staff and Disaster Relief Fund CORE staff supporting the BRIC
and HMGP programs from 87 to 474 at the end of FY 2023. Additionally,
FEMA aims to more than double the number of FMA permanent staff by the
end of FY 2025. FEMA continually assesses needs (which can vary from
Region to Region) and, requests additional staff as appropriate to
right-size staffing to meet the need. FEMA is also seeking to employ
innovative solutions to update and streamline our operations and
processes to better meet expanded program requirements. Some of these
initiatives include deploying staff in strike teams to increase the
speed of reviews and project approvals, improving, and streamlining
data tracking and assessment, strengthening technical assistance, and
improving training processes and effectiveness.

Question 3.a. What is the average length of time from award
announcement to the applicant receiving funding for BRIC grants?
Answer. FEMA recognizes the importance of applicants receiving
funding as quickly as possible. The sooner selections are made and
funds are awarded, the sooner we can change the resilience trajectory
for these entities. The amount of time it takes to award selected BRIC
subapplications depends on several factors, primary amongst them being
the completeness of the subapplication upon submission. In our
commitment to assisting under-resourced communities in applying for our
grants, FEMA also works with applicants to obtain all needed
information prior to the award as well, which can affect overall
timeline. FEMA has been tracking the time to initial obligation from
the application close date. As of May 1, 2024, an analysis of a subset
of BRIC subgrants showed that conservatively, 30 percent of subgrants
received an initial obligation within 12 months of the application
close date. There is about a 4-5-month gap between the application
close date and selection. Of note, this figure represents initial
obligations only and not complete awards. FEMA is actively working to
improve its ability to track obligation data more granularly in the
future. Like most complex projects, pre-award activities may take from
one to two years. In some cases, with communities that have less
capacity to implement more complex projects, this may take longer. The
construction phase typically takes from two to three years. Given the
scale and complexity of some projects and capacity of the applicant,
this could take longer. FEMA expects construction on most projects to
be completed within five to seven years. Closeout activities are
performed during the final stages of the project.
The projects that are typically awarded the fastest have some
similar characteristics, including less complex engineering and fewer
EHP requirements.

Question 3.b. What is the average length of time from eligible
project submission to the applicant receiving funding for HMGP grants?
Answer. HMGP provides funds to states, Tribes, and territories to
implement projects that provide long-term hazard reduction after a
major disaster. The purpose is to reduce the loss of life and property
due to future natural disasters. On average, the median number of
months from disaster declaration date (i.e., eligible project
submission) to applicant receiving HMGP grant funding is 15 months. The
amount of time it takes to award HMGP subapplications depends on
several factors. In a typical process, states, Tribes, and territories
prioritize subapplications for FEMA review and approval based on their
FEMA-approved Hazard Mitigation Plan. FEMA reviews the subapplications
to ensure they meet all HMA eligibility criteria. FEMA assumes that
``eligible project submission'' refers to the major disaster
declaration date, as this is when applicants can begin submitting
applications. However, based on a number of factors outlined below,
using this milestone as the time to begin measurement may include time
during which no applications have been submitted. Furthermore, some
applicants may request an application deadline extension. One factor
that impacts time to obligate includes the process of developing and
submitting a subapplication for review, which is unique to each
disaster and applicant. For applicants with existing HMGP funding,
oversubscribed subapplications may be carried over to new disasters,
allowing for the review process to begin immediately. Applicants may
also work with subapplicants throughout the year to have ``shelf
ready'' projects available for submission as soon as a disaster is
declared.
Another factor that impacts time to obligation includes the
applicant strategies around submission timing. Some applicants choose
to submit projects as soon as they are able post-disaster, however this
is not always the case. Other applicants do not submit projects until
just prior to the deadline. These differences are due to several
factors including impacts of the disaster, capability and capacity,
project complexity, and mitigation priorities. HMGP is a FEMA-funded,
state-managed mitigation program. The state hazard mitigation office
has various internal state timelines and may have areas of focus for
the mitigation grant funds based on the expected amount of mitigation
funding because of the disaster. Additionally, the HMGP funding
estimates are provided across three points in time within the open
application period, with the first occurring within 35 calendar days of
the major disaster declaration or soon thereafter. Depending on the
severity of the disaster and accuracy of preliminary damage
assessments, early funding estimates may only represent a portion of
the total HMGP funding that is ultimately approved for a given
disaster. At 12 months after the major disaster declaration, FEMA locks
in the HMGP funding. Because of this, applicants may choose to delay
submitting and wait to determine which subapplications to put forward
based on more refined projections of available funding.

Question 4. Management costs on the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program
are calculated based on actual Federal funds expended on a disaster.
There are original estimates, but, until the federal funds are
obligated and expended states cannot draw against those management
costs. This causes a significant backlog at FEMA and the appearance
that applicants and sub-applicants are not utilizing the allowable
management costs.
What can FEMA do to streamline this process and ensure states and
locals can access these grant funds?
Answer. FEMA is committed to working quickly to assist recipients
(states, Tribal nations and territories) as well as subrecipients
(state agencies, local governments, federally recognized Tribal
governments, and certain private nonprofit organizations) to receive
management costs to implement HMGP projects. It is important to note
that obligations under HMGP can occur at any point after the recipient
has submitted an SF-424 and an Administrative Plan, and FEMA has issued
the 30-day lock-in. A recipient may submit a management costs
subapplication at any point during the open application period and can
request a portion of the available management costs to be obligated
(which is discussed in more detail below).
FEMA has taken steps to continue to assist recipients in receiving
management costs. In the 2023 HMA Program and Policy Guide, FEMA
changed its management cost policy to fix the amount of management
costs available to recipients based on the amount of subapplications
submitted by the end of the application period or when the total HMGP
ceiling is calculated, whichever is later. FEMA made this policy change
to give recipients certainty on the amount of management costs
available to manage through the life of the award.
The total amount of management costs made available to a recipient
and its subrecipients is based on the disaster's lock-in value, which
is defined as the maximum amount of funding FEMA can obligate for
eligible activities under the disaster. While lock-in ceilings are
established 12 months after a major disaster declaration, recipients
may request management costs as soon as they receive their 30-day lock-
in estimates, which are provided within 35 calendar days of the major
disaster declaration, or soon thereafter. Once FEMA reviews and
approves these requests, the recipient may begin spending these funds.
FEMA has seen that applicants take an average of 15 months post-
declaration to submit both project funding and management costs
requests. For management costs, partial funding is available as early
as 30-days post-declaration. Review of management costs requests can be
faster than requests to fund mitigation projects (due to the greater
complexity associated with project reviews). A recipient may submit a
management costs subapplication at any point during the open
application period and can request a portion of the available
management costs to be obligated. Recipients may request up to 25
percent of their estimated management cost amount after receiving their
30-day assistance estimate and up to 50 percent after the 6-month
estimate. States with a Program Administration by States (PAS)
designation may request up to 35 percent for the 30-day estimate and 75
percent for the six-month estimate. At the end of the application
period--typically 12 months after the declaration date, unless an
extension is requested--recipients may request the full management cost
amount, minus a withholding amount of three percent (or two percent for
PAS states) that becomes available at closeout.
For SLTT governments to receive subrecipient management costs from
the funding awarded to the applicant, they must apply for management
costs by including a management cost budget and narrative in their sub
application. When the subapplication is submitted, subrecipient
management cost is then reviewed and approved by the state and FEMA. As
a matter of policy, FEMA does not permit the advancing of management
cost payments, however if pre-award management costs are identified in
the subapplication and are approved, reimbursement of those expenses
are allowed.

Question 5. We understand from discussions with stakeholders that
FEMA does not award the state set-aside for BRIC prior to beginning the
evaluation of the nationally competitive projects, which may create a
delay for grantees and subgrantees to begin pre-planned work prior to
FEMA starting a separate application process.
What can be done to streamline this BRIC application process and
ensure the state set-aside does not experience unnecessary delays?
Answer. FEMA understands the importance of making selections
quickly so that funds can be awarded quickly. FEMA is focused on
awarding all BRIC subapplications, to include those within the State
and Territory Allocations and the Tribal Set-Aside, as quickly as
possible. FEMA's goal is to make selections (and the awards that
follow), as soon as possible, so subapplicants can begin implementing
projects and activities to reduce risk and increase their resiliency.
In pursuit of a streamlined review process and to help ensure that
applicants and subapplicants can maximize all available BRIC funding,
FEMA is undertaking a national review process for competitive and non-
competitive subapplications (under the State/Territory Allocations and
the Tribal Set-Aside). For FY 2021 and FY 2022, BRIC made selections
for the BRIC State and Territory Allocation and the Tribal Set-Aside
months before making selections in the national competition. Funds are
awarded from these selections once projects clear all pre-award
activities.

Question 6. We have heard from various stakeholders that despite
FEMA's best efforts, programs such as BRIC, HMGP, and other mitigation
programs have high entry costs which are prohibitively expensive to
rural and disadvantaged communities. These costs come in the form of
planning and review requirements, complicated applications, and
protracted processes that quickly become expensive to severely
understaffed organizations.
We realize FEMA recently hired a Small State and Rural Advocate,
but beyond that, what can the agency do to ensure these states and
communities have every opportunity to participate in these programs?
Answer. As the number of natural disasters and the severity of the
impacts continues to increase, there is a need to support communities,
families, and businesses with the financial resources they need to
build resilience and reduce disaster suffering prior to the next event.
FEMA has taken several actions to increase equitable access to HMA
grant funding, through increasing technical assistance and other
capacity building activities, reducing burdens of the application
process and conditions for entry, and enhancing outreach through
engagements and updated materials.
FEMA offers non-financial direct technical assistance (DTA) through
the BRIC grant program. It provides direct support to selected
communities and Tribal Nations (through a letter of interest that they
send to FEMA) for broad assistance to help improve resiliency to
natural hazards, sustain successful mitigation programs, submit high-
quality subapplications for hazard mitigation, and/or implement
innovative projects to reduce risk. FEMA offers a wide range of non-
financial support to BRIC DTA communities, including climate risk
assessments, community engagement, partnership building, and mitigation
and climate adaptation planning. Support for BRIC DTA communities can
range from pre-application activities to grant closeout. Applicants
submit requests for assistance during the annual application period.
FEMA currently supports 74 communities and Tribal Nations through
BRIC DTA. For the FY 2023 submission period, FEMA received an
additional 170 requests for assistance--31 of which were from federally
recognized Tribal Nations, 135 communities and four territories across
all 10 FEMA regions. FEMA will be selecting at least 80 new
communities, including Tribal Nations, from the FY 2023 submissions,
which will bring the total number of BRIC DTA recipients to over 154.
For those not selected via this round of assistance, FEMA, through
regional offices, will provide communities, Tribal nations, and
territories with information about technical assistance offerings from
other entities to help them meet their resilience needs. Of note, the
FMA grant program also provides grants to states for technical
assistance to local governments.
FMA is a competitive program that provides funding to states,
federally recognized Tribal governments, U.S. territories, and local
governments. Since the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 was
signed into law, funds are used for projects that reduce or eliminate
the risk of repetitive flood damage to buildings insured by the
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). FEMA also delivers technical
assistance through HMGP that focuses on making mitigation dollars more
accessible for communities that are less equipped to navigate the grant
process. We work with states, local, Tribal and territories'
governments to provide targeted technical assistance directly to
underserved communities that often struggle with limited technical
resources and programmatic knowledge so they can develop applications.
This targeted technical assistance may include support with initiatives
such as developing mitigations strategies or supporting planning-
related activities. This technical assistance is provided through
Hazard Mitigation Technical Assistance Program contracts rather than a
specific technical assistance initiative, like BRIC.
Recognizing that not all Applicants and subapplicants have the
capability and/or capacity to apply for and manage a BRIC project
grant, capability and capacity building activities are also activities
eligible for funding under BRIC. In addition to hazard mitigation
planning activities, this can also include activities that support the
development of future projects, such as project scoping activities or a
phased project approach, both of which could help bridge the gap in the
level of detail between a project concept and a complete project
subapplication.
FEMA is making access to programs more equitable for highly
disadvantaged communities by addressing one of the challenges
identified by our partners: the successful completion of a project
BCA--previously a required part of the application process for HMA
funding. While mitigation measures must still meet cost-effectiveness
requirements, as of May 2024, FEMA removed the requirement of a BCA as
a condition to apply for HMA funding for Economically Disadvantaged
Rural Communities, small and impoverished communities, federally
recognized Tribal governments, or subapplicants with a hazard
mitigation project within or primarily benefiting a Community Disaster
Resilience Zone. FEMA will review the hazard mitigation project
subapplications that are competitive and otherwise eligible for
selection and may assist such communities or tribal governments with
developing a BCA. In addition, all subapplicants may submit a cost
effectiveness narrative, rather than a BCA, for projects costing less
than $1 million. FEMA will conduct the BCA for these projects less than
$1 million to ensure cost effectiveness.
FEMA adheres to OMB Circular A-94, which reduced the discount rate
from seven percent to 3.1 percent in November 2023. FEMA also
incorporated distributional weights, and updated the pre-calculated
benefit amounts that can be readily used to determine hazard mitigation
project cost-effectiveness in our BCA toolkit. We have streamlined
cost-effectiveness in its mitigation grant programs making it easier to
approve hazard mitigation projects, especially those that are
innovative in nature, build climate resilience, and benefit underserved
communities.
Another way FEMA helps to reduce the burden on Applicants and
subapplicants is by providing reimbursement for some pre-award costs.
Applicants and subapplicants may be able to get reimbursed for certain
types of pre-award costs that are directly related to developing a BRIC
subapplication that is awarded. Such costs may have been incurred prior
to application submission, for example gathering data to be used for
preparing environmental reviews required by the National Environmental
Policy Act or developing a BCA, preparing design specifications, or
conducting workshops or meetings related to development and submission
of subapplications.
FEMA made adjustments to the point scoring criteria for the BRIC
and FMA grant programs to make it easier for disadvantaged and/or
traditionally underserved communities to receive funding. For BRIC, in
addition to Economically Disadvantaged Rural Communities, priority
points are now offered to federally recognized tribal governments and
for subapplications for a project within or primarily benefitting a
Community Disaster Resilience Zone to be more competitive in the
national competition. For FMA, it increased the final priority scoring
points and federal cost share to 90 percent for socially vulnerable
communities (using the CDC Social Vulnerability Index, specifically
Socioeconomic Status, Household Characteristics, and Housing Type and
Transportation).
These two programs are also part of the Justice40 Initiative to
deliver at least 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal
climate, clean energy, affordable and sustainable housing, and other
investments to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by
underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.
We will deliver nearly $1.6 billion to disadvantaged communities,
accounting for over 53 percent of the almost $3 billion total in FY
2022 funding.
Through the Safeguarding Tomorrow through Ongoing Risk Mitigation
Revolving Loan Fund program, FEMA works closely with applicants to
learn better ways to make administrative tasks easier, increase
capability, reach resilience and equity goals, and identify common
projects and activities for loans under the program. Based on feedback
and lessons learned from the first year of the program, FEMA has
updated the grant application forms and supporting materials to ensure
the application process is as streamlined as possible. FEMA aims to
reduce complexity and barriers for applicants to better understand the
information required for a selection and allocation.
FEMA addresses the disaster survivor experience by speeding up the
delivery of flood mitigation funding through the FMA Swift Current
opportunity. FEMA released $300 million in FY 2023 to reduce or
eliminate the impacts of flooding for repetitively or substantially
flood-damaged properties insured through the NFIP. FEMA offers tailored
pre-application support to assist FMA Swift Current applicants and
subapplicants with subapplication development. FEMA will continue to
evaluate and solicit feedback from its customers to build from the
success of the prior funding opportunities through future grant cycles.
In FY 2022, FEMA made available $60 million that was distributed
across 326 properties in four states impacted by Hurricane Ida. Within
one year from the close of the application period, over 80 percent of
the funding was awarded to Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.
For the second announcement in 2023, FEMA made available a total of
$300 million and expanded criteria to benefit more places, which as of
May 30 includes 20 states and one Tribal Nation.
FEMA is ensuring that stakeholders have straightforward and
equitable access to HMA programs, which includes reducing barriers to
access and providing focused assistance to underserved communities. For
example:

Hosted several national webinars and posting recordings
on FEMA.gov and FEMA's YouTube channel.

Updated our HMA Program and Policy Guide through reducing
complexity to make it easier for customers to know how to successfully
apply for funding.

Developed program and application support materials to
help customers navigate the grant processes.

We recently hosted our Hazard Mitigation Partners
Workshop which brought nearly 1,000 attendees virtually together in a
highly education-focused grant forum to talk through our hazard
mitigation and floodplain management work to build capacity to
withstand tomorrow's hazards.

The Community Disaster Resilience Zones initiative, which is part
of implementing the Community Disaster Resilience Zones Act of 2022, is
designed to prioritize support for the most at-risk communities in the
country, including those that are severely understaffed, under-
resourced, and overburdened. In addition to providing technical and
financial assistance to these communities through FEMA's BRIC and FMA
programs, the zone designations can also help the private sector,
nonprofits, philanthropies, and other non-federal partners target
investments in community resilience.
FEMA has developed a network of support of 11 programs from 8 other
federal agencies to support and prioritize Community Disaster
Resilience Zones. Seven of these programs provide technical assistance
to disadvantaged communities. One example is the U.S. Department of
Transportation's Thriving Communities Network, which provides technical
assistance to disadvantaged communities to help plan and build
transformative transportation projects that improve mobility,
sustainability, and resilience.
Another example is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural
Partners Network (RPN), an all-of-government program that assists rural
communities identify resources and funding to create jobs, build
infrastructure, and support long-term economic stability on their own
terms. Twenty-three federal departments, agencies, and commissions,
including the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Denali
Commission, are members of the network. The RPN is leveraging its
critical networked assistance to support the 178 Community Disaster
Resilience Zones identified in rural areas.
A third example is the Economic Development Administration's new
Economic Recovery Corps, designed to accelerate recovery from the
COVID-19 pandemic in distressed communities and regions throughout the
U.S. by connecting organizations with the talent and capacity needed to
advance new ways of doing economic development that promote economic
resilience and transformative change.

Questions to Victoria Salinas, Senior Official Performing the Duties of
Deputy Administrator, Office of Resilience, Federal Emergency
Management Agency, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, from Hon.
Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon

Question 1. Six and a half years after Hurricane Maria, four years
after the 2020 earthquakes, Puerto Rico is STILL in the process of
approving and performing recovery work for municipalities, nonprofits,
faith institutions, individuals.
The next disaster is not a matter of ``if'' but of ``when'' and
``how much''. Effective plans measures to provide hazard mitigation and
a resilient infrastructure in all its modalities are critical to face
this reality. I AM an advocate of preventive measures that are not
limited to mere ``hardening'' of infrastructure or paying to rebuild
the same thing over and over, but making it possible for communities to
recover more quickly or to have flexible courses of action.
Question 1.a. The FEMA funding programs right now are also facing
issues regarding rising costs not just due to inflation but to supply
chain and workforce availability issues and the expected effect of
delays or prolonged projects. There are many projects that were
approved based on estimates that by now have been far outstripped. How
does this affect the mitigation plans? How does the Agency address
this?
Answer. FEMA has been and continues to work closely with community
officials in Puerto Rico to help rebuild after these catastrophic
events. Hurricane Maria is the largest disaster for FEMA's HMGP. Over
time, cost overruns may indeed occur as a result of infeasible cost
estimates, underestimated complexity, prolonged schedules, labor
availability, supply chain issues, or other reasons.
When managing grants under the HMGP, the recipient must notify FEMA
as soon as a cost underrun or overrun is identified. The recipient may
request additional federal assistance for identified overruns, which
FEMA may approve if program assistance is available under the grant
award. Because there is an overall cap on the HMGP grant award, the
recipient the Puerto Rico Central Office for Recovery, Reconstruction,
and Resiliency (COR3) can manage individual subgrants within that cap
amount but cannot exceed the overall cap on the grant award. The
subaward must continue to meet cost share and eligibility requirements.
In essence, applicants may use funding from cost underruns on a given
project to apply to cost overruns on another project.
Also, as per regulation 2 CFR 200.433, inflation costs can be an
eligible cost for project budgets. Inflation can be included as a
separate line item if the applicant provides appropriate justification.
Specifically, 2 CFR 200.433(a) states ``a budget estimate of future
costs which is associated with possible events or conditions arising
from causes the precise outcome of which is indeterminable at the time
of estimate, and that experience shows will likely result, in
aggregate, in additional costs'' and ``It is permissible for
contingency amounts other than those excluded in paragraph (a) of this
section to be explicitly included in budget estimates, to the extent
they are necessary to improve the precision of those estimates.'' In
addition, applicants can account for potential project cost increases
by using recognized national construction and building cost estimation
guides such as Marshall & Swift, R.S. Means, and similar publications.
Finally, though not specifically for cost overruns, project budgets
can also include contingency costs of 1-7 percent depending upon
specific circumstances. Such costs could be used to cover cost overruns
if necessary.
Hazard mitigation plans help state, local, Tribal, and territorial
(SLTT) governments build long-term, equitable solutions that reduce
risk from natural hazards. Mitigation plans describe and prioritize
hazard mitigation actions and establish a strategy to implement those
actions, including identifying responsible offices and potential
funding sources to implement those actions. Mitigation plans are
required to be reviewed and updated every five years to reflect changes
in risk as well as mitigation priorities.
Updates to the mitigation plans must consider changes in the
community's capabilities to implement their mitigation strategy, and
may include changes in project costs or changes to available funding.
However, mitigation plans are not required to include the level of
detail for fully scoped projects with cost estimates that are required
for grant applications.

Question 1.b. What has been FEMA's experience working with the
Puerto Rico Central Office of Recovery Rebuilding and Resiliency, COR3,
in the approval and obligation of mitigation funding?
Answer. FEMA's Mitigation team in the Joint Recovery Office works
with COR3 to ensure the submitted subapplications are eligible,
complete, and feasible. FEMA and COR3 meet regularly to establish
priorities and to follow up on milestones and action items. Also, both
agencies deliver continuous technical assistance to Subapplicants
helping to respond to additional information requests on a project
scope or provide subject matter expertise on a proposed mitigation
project.

Question 1.c. In the specific case of Puerto Rico's electric power
grid, can you provide us a breakdown of how the FEMA mitigation support
has been utilized, including what if any changes have been necessary in
procedures or guidance over the past few years?
Answer. Puerto Rico's electrical grid is interdependent and
requires a holistic approach for Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority
(PREPA) infrastructure projects to mitigate against future disasters.
As such, FEMA undertook a significant effort to revise the approach for
determining cost effectiveness for projects designed to mitigate future
risks to the overall electrical grid. Demonstrating cost effectiveness,
typically done with the BCA toolkit provided by FEMA, can be a
impediment for applicants in developing quality mitigation grant
applications. A concerted effort was made by FEMA Headquarters and the
PR Joint Recovery Office to develop the first ever Island Wide Benefit
Cost Analysis (IWBCA) that is supporting PREPA's efforts toward
reconstructing a more resilient electrical grid that will reduce the
impacts of future disasters.
The IWBCA aligns with the Public Assistance (PA) FEMA Accelerated
Awards Strategy (FAASt) (announced in 2020), in which critical
infrastructure programs are grouped together to expedite critical
energy work in PR. The PA FAASt project treats all PREPA infrastructure
as a single, island-wide set of interconnected and interdependent
components. The aggregated IWBCA applies the same approach for purposes
of evaluating the cost-effectiveness of proposed hazard mitigation
measures, with one BCA applied to the entire FAASt project that
includes benefits based on future costs avoided of physical damage to
the infrastructure, costs related to the response and reconnection
effort, and the loss of function for electric service caused by the
storm. The IWBCA approach streamlines the cost-effectiveness review of
mitigation projects under one IWBCA umbrella. Defining the maximum
benefit in this way greatly simplifies funding and cost-effectiveness
requirements. The IWBCA enables FEMA to avoid double counting of
benefits and allows for coordination across the PREPA infrastructure on
PA Mitigation and HMGP implementation, thereby avoiding both
duplication of programs and gaps in the system's disaster resilience.
The IWBCA applies to all mitigation measures associated with PREPA
funded by the PA and HMGP programs. To ensure that, following system
reconstruction, PREPA infrastructure is resilient and meets all
applicable codes and standards, PA and HMGP will fund hazard mitigation
measures that meet all program requirements, including a cost-
effectiveness evaluation using the IWBCA.
FEMA approved the use of aggregated benefits defined in the IWBCA
to all PA Mitigation and HMGP PREPA projects under DR-4339-PR, helping
to expedite the funding of, and satisfying the cost-effectiveness
requirements for, projects eligible under Sections 404 and 406 of the
Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  5170c and 5172). The projects still must meet
applicable legal and programmatic eligibility requirements. These
efforts resulted in $7.6 billion in Total Hazard Mitigation Benefits
(Estimated total benefits for both 404 and 406 Mitigation (FEMA Public
Assistance Mitigation)). This is a novel and impactful approach to
demonstrating cost effectiveness which should facilitate a more
streamlined application review and approval process. This approach
takes a holistic viewpoint of the electrical grid so as to avoid
individual, piecemeal cost effectiveness determinations on every
project. This is the largest project of its kind and FEMA will continue
to investigate ways where this approach may benefit other
infrastructure types.

Question to Victoria Salinas, Senior Official Performing the Duties of
Deputy Administrator, Office of Resilience, Federal Emergency
Management Agency, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, from Hon. Mike
Ezell

Question 1. In recent community engagements across various regions,
constituents and stakeholders have expressed concerns regarding the
apparent disparity in the disbursement of BRIC (Building Resilient
Infrastructure and Communities) funding from state aside dollars. BRIC
funding, designed to bolster resilience and mitigate risks in
communities, is expected to be one of the faster-flowing financial
resources. However, reports suggest that certain regions are
experiencing delays or inadequate allocation, hindering their ability
to implement crucial resilience measures.
To address these concerns comprehensively, please provide the total
dollars obligated and allocated (paid) under BRIC funding,
disaggregated by state set-aside, tribal set-aside, building code plus-
up, and competitive program. Please provide the total dollars obligated
and allocated (paid), deobligated and reasons for deobligations for
each state by fiscal year beginning with Fiscal Year 2020. Please
segment by the designated categories: state set-aside, tribal set-
aside, building code plus-up, and competitive program.
Answer. The BRIC program's state and territory allocations help to
ensure that all states and territories have an opportunity to apply for
and receive BRIC funding. This allocation, combined with the separate
set-aside specifically for Tribes, contributes to geographically
disbursed awards.
Under the state/territory allocations, Applicants (States and
Territories) establish criteria and rank subapplications from local
communities. FEMA then takes the selections of the state/territory to
move them through the award process. Given that the set-aside is to
state and territories, FEMA does not have mechanism in place for
subapplicants (such as municipalities or communities) to grieve or
contest the applicant rankings. This would be handled at the applicant
level. In rare circumstances, FEMA may fund eligible subapplications
out of priority order due to insufficient funding, duplicate
subapplications, program priorities, and/or other pertinent
information. During the FY 2023 BRIC funding cycle FEMA allocated $2
million to each state/territory and set aside $50 million for tribal
applicants. New in 2023, FEMA also allocated $2 million to each state/
territory to carry out eligible building code adoption and enforcement
activities and set aside $25 million for tribal applicants to do the
same. This is in addition to the more than $700 million in funding made
available under the national competition. FEMA recognizes the
importance of obligating BRIC funds to communities as quickly as
possible, so that communities can start their own path towards
resilience.
Please see Attachment A which includes publicly available data that
can be found on the OpenFEMA platform. Of note, the requested data is
not available yet for the building code plus up, as the FY 2023 grant
cycle was the first year to include the building code plus up. Overall,
this attachment shows:

Approximate Obligations as a Percent of Total Selected
Amount:
+  2020: 47 percent
+  2021: 32 percent
+  2022: Seven percent

Approximate Obligations as a Percent of Total Selected
Amount (By Type):
+  National Competition: 18 percent
+  State/Territory Allocation: 73 percent
+  Tribal Set-Aside: 34 percent
+  Management Costs: 12 percent

Attachment A includes data related to de obligated funds. FEMA does
not actively track reasons for de-obligations in its system.
