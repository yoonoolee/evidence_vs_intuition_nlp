Truckstops (NATSO) and SIGMA: America's Leading Fuel Marketers
(SIGMA), the Community Transportation Association of America
(CTAA), the American Trucking Associations (ATA), and Atlas
Public Policy.

II. BACKGROUND

The Biden Administration has set a goal of achieving net-
zero emissions by 2050, with a target for 50 percent of all new
car sales to be electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030.\1\ The
Administration also pledged to build a National network of
500,000 EV chargers along United States highways and
communities to meet this goal.\2\ IIJA included $7.5 billion
for EV charging infrastructure efforts and an additional $10
billion for electrification and carbon reduction efforts across
other transportation programs, and over $7 billion in EV
battery components and critical minerals.\3\ IIJA also created
the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation (Joint Office)
for collaboration between the Department of Transportation
(DOT) and the Department of Energy (DOE) in the deployment of
EV charging infrastructure.\4\

Currently, China leads the world in EV infrastructure
investment, with EV sales more than double the global average,
and over 760,000 public fast charging points and one million
public slow charging points.\5\ On March 27, 2024, Treasury
Secretary Janet Yellen warned that China's rapid ramp-up of
solar energy, electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries
promotes unfair competition and ``distorts global prices'' \6\
and ``hurts American firms and workers, as well as firms and
works around the world.'' \7\ Similarly, the European Union
launched its own investigation into Chinese subsidies for EVs
last year, worried about the threat to its own auto
industry.\8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to the DOE, as of 2022, EVs accounted for less
than one percent of all registered light-duty vehicles in the
United States.\9\ The United States Energy Information
Administration (EIA) found that in the third quarter of 2023,
sales of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery-electric vehicles
(BEV) in the United States rose to 17.7 percent of new light-
duty vehicle sales, with about eight percent of those being
BEVs. but slowed in recent months.\10\ According to Kelley Blue
Book, there were nearly 1.2 million EVs sold in the United
States in 2023.\11\ Following the enactment of expanded tax
credits for EVs in 2021, the tax credits became available as a
point-of-sale discount at the start of 2024.\12\ EV sales went
down 7.3 percent in the first quarter of 2024 when compared
with the final quarter of 2023, although are up 2.6 percent
when compared with the same time period last year.\13\
Additionally, there is an excess of EV inventory, as the
available inventory of EVs is 136 days, compared to the overall
inventory of 78 days.\14\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Joint Office estimates there are more than 67,000 EV
charging stations across the country, with over 177,000
charging ports.\15\ The National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL)
estimates an investment between $31 and $55 billion in publicly
accessible charging infrastructure would be needed to meet the
Administration's goals.\16\ NREL found that ``existing
(investment) announcements put the United States on a path to
meet 2030 investment needs.'' \17\ Through March 2023, an
estimated $23.7 billion of capital has been announced for
publicly accessible light-duty charging infrastructure,
including from private firms, electric utilities, and the
public sector, which includes funding from Federal, state, and
local governments.\18\ However, a JD Power study from August
2023 found that despite the increase in public charging
stations across the United States, customer satisfaction
declined to the lowest level since the study began in 2021.\19\
This decline in public acceptance is due to the unreliability
of public chargers and the speed and cost of charging.\20\

III. SELECT DOT ELECTRIFICATION PROGRAMS

EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) formula
program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (CFI)
discretionary grant program were created under IIJA to build
out EV charging infrastructure across the country.\21\ The NEVI
program is funded at $5 billion over the fiscal year (FY) 2022
to FY 2026 period and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
mainly distributes funding by formula to the states.\22\ In
order to receive the funds, states must submit an EV Charging
Infrastructure Deployment Plan to the Joint Office.\23\ NEVI
funding must be used on projects that directly relate to the
charging of a vehicle and are open to the public, or multiple
commercial motor vehicle (CMV) operators.\24\

The CFI discretionary grant program is authorized at $2.5
billion over the FY 2022 to FY 2026 period and receives funds
from the Highway Trust Fund.\25\ The program funds two
categories of projects, Community Charging and Fueling grants
and Alternative Fuel Corridor (AFC) grants, with the intent of
deploying publicly available EV charging infrastructure.\26\
The Community Charging and Fueling program prioritizes
underserved, low-income, rural, and high-density
communities.\27\ AFC grants are awarded to projects that deploy
alternative fueling infrastructure, like hydrogen, propane, and
natural gas, in addition to EV charging stations along the
AFC.\28\

In February 2023, FHWA published its final rule relating to
minimum standards and requirements for NEVI projects.\29\ In
response to a similar notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to
set such standards for the program, the American Association of
State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) submitted
comments raising the need for uniform cybersecurity guidance
for the program to help inform the states and protect
information.\30\ In September 2023, several Members of Congress
wrote to DOT Secretary Pete Buttigieg expressing concerns
regarding the lack of effective standards and encouraging DOT
and FHWA to adopt stringent, minimum cybersecurity standards to
ensure the safety of the United States' electric grid and
Americans' personal data.\31\

According to the Joint Office, the first NEVI-funded
charging station opened in Ohio in December 2023.\32\ Since
then, one NEVI-funded station has opened each in Pennsylvania,
Hawaii, Maine, and Vermont, and three NEVI-funded stations have
opened in New York.\33\ During a December 2023 Highways and
Transit Subcommittee hearing, Members questioned FHWA
Administrator Shailen Bhatt regarding implementation of the
program, including the slow pace that NEVI-funded charging
stations were coming online.\34\

ELECTRIFICATION OF BUSES

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) administers the
Low- or No- Emission Vehicle grant program which ``provides
funding for the purchase or lease of zero-emission and low-
emission transit buses, as well as for the acquisition,
construction, or leasing of supporting facilities and
requirements.'' \35\ Funding awarded through this program has
grown significantly from a total of $55 million in FY 2016 to
over $1.2 billion in FY 2023, a nearly 2000 percent
increase.\36\ As funding for the Low- or No- Emission and Bus
and Bus Facilities Program increased via IIJA, so did the
number of applications, reaching $7.71 billion in combined
funding requests in FY 2022.\37\ Applicants who apply for the
zero-emission vehicle grant must submit a Zero-Emission Fleet
Transition Plan.\38\ The plan must address long-term fleet
management plans, existing and future facilities, current and
future resources, fueling partnerships, emerging technologies,
and the impact on the applicant's workforce.\39\

IIJA included a 25 percent set-aside for the low-emission
provisions of this grant program to ensure that low-emission
vehicles, such as hybrid electric, compressed natural gas, or
alternative fuel buses, would receive funding.\40\
Transitioning bus fleets to electric or low-emission propulsion
vehicles entails additional challenges due to the diminishing
domestic bus manufacturing marketplace, higher costs per
vehicle, the need for increased technical and mechanical
training of workforce, limited EV-bus range capacity, and
weather degradation.\41\

FTA also imposes a `spare ratio' requirement for public
transit agencies that caps the percentage of a transit agency's
total bus fleet that can be held in reserve to be used in the
event of breakdowns, maintenance needs, or a temporary surge in
operations.\42\ As transit agencies adapt to the range
limitations of higher cost electric or alternative fueled
buses, and concurrent fleet volume growth, this ratio remains a
consideration by FTA in award reviews and can present
additional challenges.\43\

ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS WITH ELECTRIC ELIGIBILITIES

In addition to the programs dedicated to electrification,
IIJA authorized a number of transportation programs with
eligible activities that include electrification projects. For
example, the law reauthorized the Congestion Mitigation and Air
Quality (CMAQ) Improvement Program and broadened eligibility to
include projects such as replacing diesel vehicles with medium-
duty and heavy-duty zero emission vehicles and funding the
related charging equipment.\44\ IIJA also created the Carbon
Reduction Program, which funds projects that reduce
transportation emissions from on-road sources and includes
projects that support deployment of alternative fuel vehicles,
including the acquisition and installment of EV chargers and
hydrogen, natural gas, or propane fueling infrastructure.\45\

IV. RECENT SELECT ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES

FHWA announced a Request for Information (RFI) on March 6,

HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES

On March 12, 2024, the Biden Administration released the
National Zero-Emission Freight Corridor Strategy to further the
Administration's commitment to promote 30 percent of medium and
heavy-duty vehicle (ZE-MHDV) sales being zero-emission by 2030,
with a goal of 100 percent sales by 2040.\54\ The strategy
designates National EV Freight Corridors along the National
Highway Freight Network to guide the deployment of ``expansive
and convenient access to electric vehicle charging and hydrogen
refueling.'' \55\ The strategy consists of four phases:

IT'S ELECTRIC: A REVIEW OF FLEET ELECTRIFICATION EFFORTS

----------

TUESDAY, APRIL 30, 2024

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10 a.m. in room
2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Eric A. ``Rick''
Crawford (Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Crawford. The Subcommittee on Highways and Transit will
come to order.
I ask unanimous consent that the chairman be authorized to
declare a recess at any time during today's hearing. Without
objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that Members not on the
subcommittee be permitted to sit with the subcommittee at
today's hearing and ask questions. Without objection, so
ordered.
As a reminder, if Members wish to insert a document into
the record, please email it to
[email protected]
.
Before we get into the hearing, I would like to take a
moment of personal privilege to remember our colleague,
Congressman Donald Payne, Jr., who passed away last week.
Donald and I have served together on the Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee for over a decade. As his ranking
member on the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials
Subcommittee, I had the opportunity to learn more about his
commitment to this institution, his constituents, and to the
United States. It was always clear to me that his family
background in Congress had instilled a love for the House that
could not be dimmed. I will miss his presence on the committee.
And on behalf of all of us here, I want to send my prayers and
condolences to his family, friends, and staff for dealing with
this loss.
I now recognize myself for the purposes of an opening
statement for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ERIC A. ``RICK'' CRAWFORD OF
ARKANSAS, CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON HIGHWAYS AND TRANSIT

Mr. Crawford. We are here today to discuss the Biden
administration's efforts to increase the number of electric
vehicles, or EVs, on our Nation's roadways, and the
infrastructure challenges stemming from that goal. But this
hearing is also about much more than that. I believe in
consumer choice, the choice to decide where you want to go and
how you want to get there. Sadly, the Biden administration
doesn't seem to share that view.
The President campaigned on a pie-in-the-sky goal of
reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. We all know that is
unachievable without massive economic hardship on working
Americans. He is committed to that vision regardless of what
that means for the moms and dads who simply want to buy a new
car, minivan, or pickup to make it easier to get to work or to
take their kids to school.
A key part of this goal includes President Biden's pledge
to have 50 percent of all new car sales be EVs by 2030 and to
build out a national charging network with 500,000 public EV
chargers. And that's not to mention the regulatory onslaught
from the EPA. The EPA just released new tailpipe emission
standards for light-duty vehicles and medium- and heavy-duty
vehicles that will balloon the cost of a vehicle. This, of
course, follows the EPA reinstating a waiver of California's
CARB standards that 17 States have sued the administration
over.
I am, frankly, shocked at this administration's insistence
on remaking the domestic vehicle industry in a top-down,
Soviet-style 5-year plan that is devoid of commonsense market-
driven data.
I am not opposed to EVs. I am not opposed to any
alternative energy vehicle, but the Government shouldn't try to
control the market and shouldn't stack the deck in favor of one
vehicle over another. The fact is, the EVs are sitting on car
lots an average of 58 days longer compared to their
conventional counterparts, and according to the Kelley Blue
Book, they cost at least $5,000 more.
Americans are hurting with runaway inflation thanks to this
administration's economic failures. I'm not sure they can
afford an additional $5,000 for a vehicle they don't really
want and that doesn't give them the reliability they need.
Under this subcommittee's jurisdiction, the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA, contained $7.5 billion for
programs intended to build out charging networks. Yet to date,
only eight charging stations have been opened. Eight. It has
been about 2\1/2\ years since IIJA was enacted, and we have
eight charging stations to show for this multibillion-dollar
investment. I am sure our witnesses will talk more about that
today.
I also remain concerned that there appears to be a lack of
minimum Federal cybersecurity standards for these chargers,
which create access points for hackers into our electric grid
in a way that traditional fueling stations simply do not.
Separately, I am concerned that China controls the market for
the majority of the critical minerals and refineries needed to
produce EV batteries. And just like there hasn't been anything
that I would call a real plan to deal with increased cyber
vulnerabilities, I have yet to see the administration make any
proposals that will address the future of our Nation's Highway
Trust Fund, which is dependent on user fees generated by excise
taxes on gasoline and diesel.
The Highway Trust Fund provides the long-term certainty
necessary for State departments of transportation to plan
roadway and mass transit projects. More vehicles on the road
that do not pay into the Highway Trust Fund is going to have an
impact. In fact, in February, the Congressional Budget Office
released an updated 10-year baseline which estimates a delta of
$280 billion by 2034, but understates the full impact of the
new tailpipe regulations.
The Biden administration is so focused on the President's
promise of achieving net zero by 2050 that it is not listening
to consumers who actually purchase vehicles, nor is it
factoring in the realistic challenges of electrification at the
expense of other viable fuel options.
Innovation within the marketplace is important, and we
should encourage it. In fact, just the other week, I was the
first Member of Congress to drive Tesla's newest model of the
Cybertruck on the Capitol plaza. Private investment and
innovation should be encouraged. However, I do not support the
Federal Government mandating where the market goes, picking
winners and losers by prioritizing one type of alternative fuel
over others.
For example, last week, the Department of Energy's National
Petroleum Council found that the hydrogen industry is not
growing fast enough to meet the administration's climate goals,
and the American Transportation Research Initiative released a
report analyzing the benefits of renewable diesel compared to
battery-electric trucks.
Consumers and businesses should have the choice about what
types of cars, trucks, or buses they want to buy that make the
most sense for their bottom line.
Another concern with respect to the Biden administration's
pursuit of EVs for all: the United States does not have
infrastructure that can, at this time, support the levels of
electrification the administration is pushing. A study out of
Princeton University estimates that domestic energy levels are
supposed to increase 18 percent from 2022 to 2030; however, the
study notes that in order to meet the demand for just light-
duty vehicles, there would need to be a 3,360-percent increase
by 2035.
There are even more challenges with trucks. The technology
needed to electrify the trucking industry just simply isn't
ready. A Roland Berger study commissioned by the Clean Freight
Coalition found that a $1 trillion investment is necessary to
electrify the U.S. commercial truck fleet. This includes $620
billion for charging infrastructure and $370 billion to upgrade
the power grid.
Setting aside those massive needs, even if you can find an
electric truck, they are cost prohibitive for many in the
industry. The average battery-electric Class 8 truck costs over
$400,000 compared to a diesel running close to $180,000
currently.
I respect the rights of a company to decide if it is in the
company's best interest to electrify their fleet, just like I
respect their ability to choose to go in another direction,
like natural gas. But it is also important to recognize that
many fleets, including owner-operators, will be put at a
competitive disadvantage and simply can't afford to purchase
new vehicles, let alone a $400,000 rig.
To add to these challenges, the batteries in these trucks
can weigh up to 16,000 pounds, roughly one-quarter of the total
allowable weight. That will make already slim margins for
payload offset even slimmer. Add in the fact that it takes
between 2.9 to 5.7 hours to recharge the battery--that is, if
you can find an open and functioning charger. That's on top of
the current challenge we know exists with the truck parking
shortage. Less product will move on each truck, and each truck
will take longer to get to its destination. That is not a
recipe for success.
Similar issues exist for local transit agencies moving to
battery-electric propulsion buses, which can't spend hours
recharging with passengers aboard, nor can existing electric
buses meet the distance ranges needed for many local agency
routes, especially those in rural areas. The bus manufacturing
market has consolidated over the past several years such that
only two companies currently make electric buses domestically.
The result is a lengthy production to delivery timetable and a
marketplace with little room for smaller EV bus orders,
compounding the competition challenges.
And similar to the heavy-duty truck sector, battery-
electric buses often run as much as double the cost of a
traditional diesel bus. Altogether, this means more expensive
buses that take longer to procure and that can't drive as far
or as often as the diesel equipment in use today.
You must also factor in bad weather and extreme
temperatures' effect on battery-electric vehicles and the
limited ranges that batteries can operate. These are just some
of the concerns I have with rushing to electrify our
transportation sector in this top-down, mandated way.
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today. A
number of you can provide valuable firsthand experience on
adding battery-electric vehicles to your fleet.

Mr. Crawford. I now recognize Ranking Member Holmes Norton
for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA, RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON HIGHWAYS AND
TRANSIT

Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Before I address the topic of this hearing, I would like to
take a moment to remember my friend, Congressman Donald Payne,
Jr. He and I worked together in the Congressional Black Caucus
and on this committee. His leadership and his commitment to
public service will be deeply missed.
I would like to thank subcommittee Chair Rick Crawford for
holding this hearing on electric vehicles.
We are in the midst of a substantial change in our
transportation system. For years, cars, trucks, and transit
lines have run primarily on gas and diesel. While these fuels
powered our economy and our mobility, we have also paid a high
price for our reliance on fossil fuels.
Transportation pollution causes heart attacks, asthma, low
infant birth rates, and premature death. It also contributes
significantly to the warming of our planet. Transportation is
responsible for 29 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
Over half of that comes from passenger cars and light-duty
trucks. And almost one-quarter of that comes from medium- and
heavy-duty trucks.
That means this subcommittee has significant responsibility
in finding a path forward toward a cleaner future. Part of that
means giving people more transportation choices--including
rail, transit, walking, and biking--that produce fewer
emissions than driving.
But many Americans rely on driving as their primary mode of
transportation, and electric vehicles have a significant role
to play as well.
Thanks to the strong environmental policies championed by
this committee last Congress, the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act have put us on a
better course. This includes the $5 billion for the National
Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program, the $2.5 billion for
the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program, and the
$5.6 billion for the Low- or No-Emission Bus Grant Program.
Congress gave the Biden administration a tall order in
creating the new electric vehicle charging programs. We first
required them to establish the Joint Office of Energy and
Transportation to ensure coordinating of Federal investments
and policies. We required them to issue detailed technical
specifications to make sure that federally funded chargers met
certain quality standards. And the Biden administration chose
to issue stronger Buy America standards for electric vehicle
chargers to ensure that our Federal programs are supporting
jobs here in the United States.
We also required States to create plans to ensure
investments are targeted wisely. All of this had to happen
before the projects went out to bid. I know some had raised
concerns about the pace at which these new programs are
unfolding. It is important to deploy chargers as quickly as
possible to help spur the transition to clean vehicles, but it
is also important to get these programs right--and I appreciate
the Biden administration's commitment to doing so.
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about
any recommendations to improve these programs. Also, I look
forward to discussing the Low- or No-Emission Bus Grant
Program. While the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
provided a significant funding increase for the program, demand
for these grants still far exceeds available funding.
Electrification of our transit systems can provide a
roadmap for electrifying other fleets, including our commercial
motor vehicles. Moving to a cleaner transportation system will
require a good-faith partnership between all levels of
Government, manufacturers, shippers, utilities, and technology
companies.
I hope all our witnesses will contribute to finding
solutions, and I look forward to your testimony.
I would like to close by reiterating my strong opposition
to H.R. 7526, the DC Consumer Vehicle Choice Protection Act,
which would repeal the District of Columbia's regulation
adopting Advanced Clean Cars 2. This bill, which the Committee
on Oversight and Accountability passed last month, is an attack
on DC home rule, the environment, and public health.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

And the Biden Administration chose to issue stronger Buy America
standards for electric vehicle chargers to ensure that our federal
programs are supporting jobs here in the U.S.
We also required states to create strategic plans to ensure
investments are targeted wisely.
All of this had to happen before projects went out to bid. I know
some have raised concerns about the pace at which these new programs
are unfolding.
It is important to deploy chargers as quickly as possible to help
spur the transition to clean vehicles. But it is also important to get
these programs right--and I appreciate the Biden Administration's
commitment to doing so.
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about any
recommendations to improve these programs.
I also look forward to discussing the Low- and No-Emission Bus
grant program. While the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
provided a significant funding increase for the program, demand for
these grants still far exceeds available funding.
Electrification of our transit systems can provide a roadmap for
electrifying other fleets, including our commercial motor vehicles.
Moving to a cleaner transportation system will require a good-faith
partnership between all levels of government, manufacturers, shippers,
utilities and technology companies.
I hope all our witnesses will contribute to finding solutions, and
I look forward to your testimony.
I would like to close by reiterating my strong opposition to H.R.
7526, the D.C. Consumer Vehicle Choice Protection Act, which would
repeal the District of Columbia's regulation adopting Advanced Clean
Cars 2. This bill, which the Committee on Oversight and Accountability
passed last month, is an attack on D.C. home rule, the environment, and
public health.

Mr. Crawford. I thank the gentlelady.
I now recognize the ranking member of the full committee,
Mr. Larsen, for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair and Ranking
Member, for holding this hearing.
I, too, want to take a brief opportunity to express sadness
at the loss of my friend and colleague, Don Payne, Jr. He was a
fierce advocate for the traveling public. He was a friend to
everyone who knew him. I will miss him as well.
Turning to today's hearing, electric vehicles are steadily
increasing on the Nation's roadways, moving both people and
goods. Today's hearing focuses on fleet electrification efforts
across the passenger vehicle, trucking, and transit sectors.
Each of these modes has unique needs and challenges that must
be addressed to support a smooth transition to a cleaner and
greener surface transportation system.
I would note, perhaps minus some of the rhetoric from the
chair, I agree with a lot of his criticisms about how quickly
things are moving. We might also differ on solutions, but I
don't disagree with some of the challenges that you have laid
out. But I would note that fleet electrification is not only
good for the climate, it is critical to enhancing our Nation's
economic competitiveness.
The International Energy Agency reports that the number of
electric cars sold globally in the first 3 months of this year
is roughly equivalent to the number sold in all of 2020.
In 2024, EVs could reach up to 45 percent of new car sales
in China and 25 percent in Europe. In the U.S., that projection
is just over 10 percent. And America's economic competitors are
investing in EVs. The U.S. can't take a backseat in this race.
Electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle registrations reached
record levels in my home State last year, with Washington State
seeing the biggest increase in EV market share of any State.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is supporting the
adoption of EVs in Washington State and nationwide by providing
funding and supporting domestic manufacturing and supply chains
for critical minerals, including $7.5 billion for EV charging
infrastructure, $10 billion for electrification across other
transportation modes, and $7 billion in EV battery components
and critical minerals.
This funding is critical to filling initial market gaps,
supporting broader deployment, and enhancing domestic supply
chains. Policy changes in the BIL, including new, stronger Buy
America standards for EV chargers, are ensuring this funding
goes further to support domestic manufacturing.
Just 3 years ago, the production of fast chargers was
almost nonexistent. Now, there are at least 26 companies
manufacturing these products within the U.S.
Last week, I attended an EV charger installation and
training event at the Mount Vernon Library Commons in my
district. This event showcased how $12.5 million from the BIL
Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program is being used
to install 78 public EV charging ports at the Library Commons
project. This event also featured an installation demonstration
in partnership with the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers Local 191 and the private-sector National Electrical
Contractors Association Cascade Chapter.
These organizations partnered to provide training for
journeymen, apprentices, and other electrical workers under the
collective bargaining agreements in the EV industry. It is an
example that shows that investing in fleet electrification can
benefit U.S. workers and create jobs that pay well.
Also in my district, major truck manufacturer PACCAR is
using their test center, which is located at the Port of Skagit
and which Chair Graves and I visited, along with
Representatives Brownley and DeSaulnier last year. They are
using their test center to validate the next generation of
clean commercial vehicles, and I am sure that they would love
to have any other Member of Congress visit their facility to
see what this major truck manufacturer is doing on clean
commercial vehicles. Today, they offer six battery-electric
truck models and are developing technologies, including
hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks and internal combustion
engines running on hydrogen, to get ahead of the market.
While access to EV chargers has grown significantly, up
nearly 85 percent in 3 years, almost all of this growth,
though, has been driven by private investment.
A lot of work remains to ensure communities receive the
full benefit of BIL funding.
To date, States have opened, and the chair recognizes this,
have opened only eight charging stations through the National
Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, Program, leading to
legitimate questions and criticism of publicly funded charger
deployments, ones that can be answered. The slow pace of
deployment is partly because the administration took time to
ensure these chargers will be made in the U.S. by U.S. workers
and to establish standards to create a consistent user
experience at the stations.
However, as we will hear in today's testimony, because NEVI
projects are delivered by State DOTs, the District of Columbia,
and Puerto Rico, a patchwork of program requirements has
complicated deployment. Private businesses looking to build out
EV chargers must navigate 52 unique programs, which has slowed
deployment and caused confusion. So, I urge the Federal Highway
Administration and the newly created Joint Office of Energy and
Transportation to update their guidance to make this process
more uniform.
Electrification challenges are not unique to passenger
vehicles. The trucking and transit sectors are working to
transition their fleets and face challenges with the range,
cost, and the limited number of manufacturers. On the other
hand, and certainly in transit, they seem to be navigating this
fairly well.
Through innovation and collaboration between the public and
private sector, I believe the U.S. can overcome these
challenges and deliver benefits for the economy, the
environment, and for U.S. workers.
So, we are still in the early stages of this major
transition. It won't be as simple as flipping a switch--I
apologize for that pun--and the Federal Government will
continue to play an important role.
BIL initiatives are starting to fill in gaps in the market
and support the onshoring of the manufacturing process.
Congress and the administration must work with global partners
to secure supply chains for critical minerals that are
essential to EVs and infrastructure; for instance, a newly
announced effort between the U.S. and Norway to get a critical
minerals agreement.
Without continued Federal support and action, the U.S.
risks falling further behind our competitors in a crucial
industry, something no one wants.
So, I thank the witnesses for being here today, and I look
forward to the discussion.
With that, I yield back.

I want to welcome our witnesses and thank them for being
here today.
Before we get started, I want to take a quick minute to
explain our lighting system. Seems pretty self-explanatory, but
there are three lights in front of you. Green means go. But
unlike with our stoplights, yellow does not mean proceed with
caution, as you might expect. It actually means hurry it up
because it is fixing to change, you are running low on time.
And when you get to the end of that time, you might hear a
little reminder [tapping gavel] that your light has turned red.
And we just want to make sure that your remarks are kept to 5
minutes.
I ask unanimous consent that the witnesses' full statements
be included in the record. Without objection, so ordered.
I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing
remain open until such time as our witnesses have provided
answers to any questions that may be submitted to them in
writing. Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open 15
days for additional comments and information submitted by
Members or witnesses to be included in the record of today's
hearing. Without objection, so ordered.
As your written testimony has been made part of the record,
the subcommittee asks that you limit your oral remarks to 5
minutes.
And with that, Ms. Okafor, you are recognized for 5
minutes.

TESTIMONY OF KIMBERLY OKAFOR, GENERAL MANAGER OF ZERO EMISSION
SOLUTIONS, THE LOVE'S FAMILY OF COMPANIES, ON BEHALF OF NATSO,
REPRESENTING AMERICA'S TRAVEL PLAZAS AND TRUCK STOPS, AND
SIGMA: AMERICA'S LEADING FUEL MARKETERS

Mrs. Okafor. Thank you, Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member
Holmes Norton, and members of the subcommittee. It is a
pleasure to be testifying before you this morning.
My name is Kim Okafor. I am an electrical engineer by
training, and I have worked for the Love's Family of Companies,
building out our EV charging network, as well as other low-
carbon building solutions. I am testifying today on behalf of
NATSO and SIGMA, the leading national trade associations
representing transportation energy retailers.
Although Love's is the second largest truckstop company in
the country, we do more than just sell fuel. We also provide
services, amenities, and security that drivers want when they
refuel their vehicles. We are agnostic to what type of fuel we
sell. We sell gasoline or ethanol or diesel or biodiesel or
electricity, just like we sell Coke or Pepsi or coffee or tea.
We sell whatever the driver wants.
At the risk of stating the obvious, we found that our
customers want the most reliable, convenient, lowest cost fuel
available. Our job as fuel retailers is to identify that fuel
and to deliver it to every community across this country. We
have supported policies that encourage investments in
alternative fuels and reward businesses that make those
investments.
We are, first and foremost, a real estate company. We
derive our greatest value from identifying prime locations
across the country where drivers are most likely to stop when
they refuel. From there, we simply sell drivers the fuels and
products that they want in a fast, secure, and convenient
setting.
The best way to lower the carbon footprint of
transportation fuel is through policies that both encourage
businesses, such as Love's, to offer more alternatives, and
also make those alternatives more attractive to consumers.
I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to prioritize
the consumer in this conversation. Consumers will not purchase
EVs if they are not confident in the charging network, not just
how many chargers there are, but where those chargers are
located.
Many seem to think that EVs need an entirely new refueling
network, and that is just not the case. Our industry has spent
the last 60 years building out a competitive refueling network
that has adapted over time to align with driver preferences,
and we want to do this well into the future.
We have supported and are actively engaged in EV charging
grant programs such as NEVI. I am happy to say that more than
half of the NEVI awards awarded to date have gone to fuel
retail sites. Love's has won approximately $30 million to
install EV charging stations across our network, and we are
extremely grateful for this opportunity and take seriously the
responsibility that comes along with it.
Public investments in EV charging stations should require
site hosts to be financially motivated to provide a positive
consumer experience. This motivation should come from
anticipated revenue that is realized when the charging stations
are utilized and not just deployed. Public funds go the
furthest when they mobilize grant recipients not just to
install the charging stations, but to provide an ongoing
positive consumer experience, even after the public investment
program ends.
Beyond NEVI, there are other policies that need to be
reexamined. The rate that I pay for electricity from my
charging station should be the rate that any other business
pays. No one should have a leg up on anyone else. This is not
the case today. Creating a level playing field will invite
additional investments in EV charging stations and ultimately
make consumers more willing to buy EVs.
If I leave you with one thought, let it be this: Any
changes to the transportation energy market in this country
must work for the American consumer. If Congress ensures there
are competitive market dynamics governing EV charging, then
electrified transportation will be available, affordable, and
attractive to the driving public. This can be done by
leveraging the existing refueling network, ensuring that
Federal incentives are not squandered, and addressing the
structural electricity market impediments to EV charging.
Again, I am honored to be testifying before you this
morning. I appreciate the opportunity. I look forward to
working together on these important policies and welcome any
questions that you may have.
Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Kimberly Okafor, General Manager of Zero Emission
Solutions, the Love's Family of Companies, on behalf of NATSO,
Representing America's Travel Plazas and Truck Stops, and SIGMA:
America's Leading Fuel Marketers
I. Summary of Testimony
Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Holmes Norton, and distinguished
members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on
Highways and Transit. Thank you for the opportunity to testify at this
important hearing reviewing fleet electrification efforts.
NATSO and SIGMA members are responsible for more than 80 percent of
retail sales of motor fuel in the United States. Our industry is
extraordinarily attuned and responsive to our customers' preferences
and proclivities. As new fuels enter the market, NATSO and SIGMA
members want to be able to sell those fuels lawfully, with manageable
risk, and a clear opportunity to generate a return on investment. While
agnostic as to what types of fuel we sell to satisfy customer demand,
fuel retailers do have a bias: we believe low and stable energy prices
are best for the American consumer and America's industrial and
geopolitical position across the world.
When it comes to transportation energy, we have found that our
customers want the most reliable, convenient, lowest-cost fuel
available.\1\ Our industry's function is to identify that fuel and
deliver it to every community in the country. In so doing, we compete
with one another on price, speed, and quality of service. The retail
fuels market is the most transparent, competitive commodities market in
the United States.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Fuel marketers and retailers prefer long markets with a diverse
array of supply options at our disposal. This dynamic tends to enhance
consumer choice and inject an additional layer of competition into the
market. This leads to downward pressure on retail fuel prices, which is
good for both our customers and the American economy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Love's Family of Companies (``Love's''), along with the broader
retail fuel industry, has over the years integrated a variety of
alternative fuels into the fuel supply. These investments were made in
direct response to policy incentives. Our experience has equipped us to
help policymakers understand--and overcome--the impediments to an
increasingly electrified passenger fleet.
NATSO and SIGMA support policies that incentivize fuel retailers to
invest in alternative fuels, and reward businesses that make those
investments. Because fuel retailers are fuel agnostic, we are
invaluable partners to policymakers whose objectives include increasing
the consumption of alternative fuels at lower prices. With the right
alignment of policy incentives, fuel retailers are best equipped to
facilitate a fast, cost-effective transition to alternative fuels--
including electricity--in the coming years. The optimal way to lower
transportation fuels' carbon footprint is through policies that (i)
encourage businesses such as Love's to offer more alternatives, and
(ii) make those alternatives more attractive to consumers.
Consumers will not purchase electric vehicles (``EVs'') if they do
not feel confident in the charging network. American drivers expect a
seamless, predictable public charging experience not unlike their
current refueling experience, which is grounded in safe, convenient,
accessible amenities and affordable, competitive pricing. Replicating
the market dynamics that govern today's liquid retail sector is the
optimal approach to facilitating greater EV adoption.
Many seem to think that an electrified passenger fleet requires
creating an entirely new refueling network. That is not the case. Our
industry has spent the last sixty years building out a competitive
refueling infrastructure system that optimizes logistics and maximizes
customer benefits, and we want to be able to do this long into the
future.
Love's and our fellow NATSO and SIGMA members are actively engaging
in the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (``NEVI'') grant
program, which was created as part of the bipartisan Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act (``IIJA''). Under the NEVI program, federal
dollars are distributed to states, which in turn develop a grant
solicitation process and award criteria, and then distribute and
oversee the funds. If implemented properly, the NEVI program will
prompt investments that will enable recharging to look and feel similar
to the existing on-the-go refueling experience. If implemented poorly,
it will lead to chargers being installed in places that consumers have
no interest in refueling.
The NEVI program, along with broader market developments, has
prompted Love's and others in our industry to invest in EV charging
infrastructure because we think our customers will increasingly elect
to purchase electric vehicles in the future. Our industry has therefore
invested in the personnel necessary to navigate states' different
application processes and criteria, along with the intellectual capital
necessary to engage in opaque electricity markets and regulatory
regimes that were not designed to drive private capital toward EV
charging stations.
With a full year of experience navigating the NEVI program, it is
clear that the program would be more successful if the Federal Highway
Administration (``FHWA'') strongly encouraged states to: (i) prioritize
driver amenities and the consumer experience; (ii) require executed
site host agreements; (iii) prohibit caps on rates of grantees'
returns; (iv) refrain from overly restricting evaluation areas; and (v)
ensure adequate time for grant solicitations.
Even amid federal grant funding for EV charging, there are several
impediments that make it challenging for fuel retailers to identify a
pathway to profitability with respect to EV charging. Most of these
impediments involve an electricity market structure that functions very
differently than the retail fuel market. As recently as ten years ago,
for example, approximately 80% of states prohibited anyone other than a
regulated utility from selling electricity to EV drivers. This made it
virtually impossible to generate a return on EV charging station
investments. Those laws have all been reexamined over the last decade,
and today every state permits EV charging station operators to charge
EV drivers for electricity.
More updates are necessary. Changes must be made to electricity
pricing structures. Most retailers with EV chargers today are forced to
pay retail prices for electricity with excessive demand charges. There
is no business case for buying at retail prices and selling at retail
prices. For the private market to work, there must be a pathway for
retailers to buy electricity at wholesale prices (i.e., the internal
transfer cost that utilities have to deliver electricity) without
punitive demand charges. That would make the economics work not only
for retailers but, more importantly, for consumers.
In addition, federal EV charging incentive policies are generally
limited to relief from upfront capital expenditures associated with
installing the physical charging equipment. There are no incentives to
lower station owners' ongoing costs for acquiring and dispensing
electricity into EVs. This distinguishes electricity from other
alternative fuels that have had more success gaining commercial
acceptance: those fuels have federal incentives that make the fuel less
expensive (such as blending or production tax credits), in addition to
incentives that make installing the refueling infrastructure less
expensive.
If Congress is interested in resolving challenges to fleet
electrification in the United States, it should proactively redress
these obstacles rather than assume they will dissipate on their own
under unachievable mandates that forgo consumer choice.
Any changes to transportation energy must work for American
consumers. If Congress ensures there are competitive market dynamics
governing refueling--including alternatives like electricity--
electrified transportation will be available, affordable, and
attractive for the driving public. Congress can do this by (i)
recognizing the importance of harnessing the existing refueling network
to mitigate so-called ``range anxiety''; (ii) ensuring that existing
federal incentives for charging infrastructure are not squandered; and
(iii) addressing structural electricity market impediments to public EV
charging.
II. Introduction
My name is Kimberly Okafor, and I am the General Manager of Zero
Emission Solutions at Trillium Energy Solutions and the Love's Family
of Companies. In this capacity, I oversee our development and
management of EV charging, hydrogen fueling and solar businesses. I am
testifying today on behalf of NATSO, Representing America's Travel
Centers and Truck Stops, and SIGMA: America's Leading Fuel
Marketers.\2\ NATSO and SIGMA are the leading national trade
associations representing transportation energy retailers, representing
more than 80 percent of retail sales of motor fuel in the United
States. In addition to transportation energy, our industry provides the
services, amenities, and security that American motorists want when
they refuel. This is due to the convenient locations of our real estate
and the highly competitive and transparent pricing we offer. On behalf
of NATSO and SIGMA, we are eager to work with the Committee to continue
to support the nation's motorists in the coming decades.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ NATSO represents more than 5,000 travel plazas and truck stops
nationwide, comprised of both national chains and small, independent
locations. SIGMA represents a diverse membership of approximately 260
independent chain retailers and marketers of motor fuel.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. The Love's Family of Companies
Founded in 1964 and headquartered in Oklahoma City, Love's Travel
Stops and Country Stores and its affiliated companies employ over
nearly 40,000 Americans and is still family-owned and operated. Our
core business is travel stops and convenience stores, with 643
locations (translating to approximately 50,000 truck parking spaces) in
42 states. Each year the company adds between 20-25 new locations and
between 55-125 jobs to each community we join. Love's is a significant
economic contributor to the communities in which we operate and is
often the largest taxpayer in those communities. Love's starts giving
back to the communities that it joins the day a new store opens. Team
members, who live locally, choose a nonprofit organization to which
Love's donates $5,000 and each district has an annual donation budget
moving forward. Through the annual Children's Miracle Network Hospitals
campaign, and recently added year-round giving at the pin pad, Love's
has raised more than $54 million for sick and injured children.
In 2016, Love's acquired the Trillium alternative fuels company and
has made it a member of the Love's Family of Companies. This year,
Trillium Energy Solutions celebrates its 30th year. For the first 20
years, Trillium projects mostly involved designing, building, and
operating a network of compressed natural gas fueling stations for
Fortune 500 companies' trucking fleets and public entities (such as
transit agencies). Since the Love's acquisition, we have aggressively
grown our renewable natural gas and hydrogen businesses and, for the
last several years, have been developing EV charging infrastructure at
Love's locations across the country. Love's expects to add multiple
fast chargers at approximately 100 of its locations over the next few
years.
Love's locations provide professional truck drivers and passenger
vehicles with 24-hour access to purchase transportation energy, coffee,
and restaurant offerings, along with more than 430 truck service
centers for professional drivers. Our locations are open 24 hours a
day, seven days a week, and provide restrooms, food and beverage
options, sufficient lighting, and security. We always have on-site
employees whose responsibilities include contacting law enforcement or
EMS in the event of an emergency. After natural disasters occur, our
stores are often the first up and running to provide necessary services
to motorists and first responders.
B. Our Experience Bringing Alternative Fuels to Market
Over the past twenty-five years, Love's and our broader industry
have made significant investments in bringing alternative fuels to
market. Many seem to think that a transition to electric transportation
energy requires creating an entirely new refueling network. That is not
the case. The U.S. already has in place a robust, highly competitive
refueling network. Fuel retailers are in the business of providing
competitively priced fuel and services to their customers. Unlike power
generators, refiners, or biofuels producers, fuel retailers are
agnostic to the type of fuel they sell at their locations; their goal
is to provide customers what they want, where they want it, when they
want it, and at a price they are willing to pay.
For any alternative fuel solution to work, it must promote
competitive market dynamics and work within (not against) consumers'
existing behavioral patterns and proclivities. Policies designed to
encourage private sector investment in alternative fuel infrastructure,
including (but not limited to) EV charging stations, must be predicated
upon unambiguous policy signals that such alternatives create
attractive economic propositions for our industry and for our
customers.
Love's and the industry's investments in alternative fuels have
been the direct result of federal and state policies that are designed
to make the alternatives more attractive to consumers. Below is a brief
overview of some of these investments and incentive schemes:
i. EV Charging
Love's offers publicly accessible EV charging infrastructure at
dozens of our locations and is actively investing in this space. We
have also supported fleets with EV charging design and installation
from California to Florida. Love's customizable power portfolio enables
fleets to source electricity as a ``fuel'' from the grid, solar panels,
energy storage, or an on-site generator powered by RNG.
At the federal level, the Department of Transportation's
(``DOT's'') NEVI and Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (``CFI'')
grant programs, and the ``30C'' refueling infrastructure tax credit,
help offset certain upfront capital expenditures associated with
installing EV charging infrastructure.
ii. Ethanol, Biodiesel and Renewable Diesel
Ethanol is a renewable fuel made from corn that can be blended into
gasoline as an octane booster and to reduce a vehicle's GHG emissions.
Biodiesel is made from animal fats, vegetable oils, or recycled
restaurant grease. It can be blended with diesel up to 20% (``B20'')
and used as a drop-in fuel in diesel vehicles. Renewable diesel is also
made from animal fats, vegetable oils, or recycled restaurant grease,
but the production process makes it chemically identical to petroleum
diesel. This enables it to be used as a substitute, rather than a
blend. Biodiesel and renewable diesel achieve between a 50% and more
than 80% lifecycle reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Love's is an
industry leader in blending and selling all of these low-carbon fuels.
At the federal level, incentives for these fuels consist of:
Financial support from the Department of Agriculture under the Higher
Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program (``HBIIP'') for the
infrastructure (storage tanks, blending equipment and dispensers)
necessary to bring these fuels to market; the Renewable Fuel Standard
(``RFS''); and the biodiesel tax credit. The RFS is a permanent program
administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''), whereas
the biodiesel tax credit expires at the end of 2024. It is essential
that Congress extend the biodiesel tax credit before the end of this
year to avoid surrendering the emission reductions that technology
provides.
iii. Diesel Exhaust Fluid (``DEF'')
Diesel engine manufacturers use DEF in conjunction with Selective
Catalytic Reduction (``SCR'') technology to reduce nitrous oxide
(``NOx'') emissions from exhaust gases. Love's sells DEF at all of our
truckstops and operates more than a dozen DEF production terminals
across the United States. At the federal level, incentives for DEF
consist primarily of Clean Air Act and EPA requirements for mitigating
NOx and particulate matter from heavy-duty trucks.
iv. Compressed Natural Gas (``CNG'') and Renewable Natural
Gas (``RNG'')
CNG is a clean-burning fuel produced by harnessing methane from
shale formations throughout the United States. RNG is a renewable fuel
made from the methane that is released when organic waste (e.g.,
livestock manure, food waste, etc.) breaks down. CNG and RNG are
utilized to fuel vehicles that are designed to run on natural gas.
Love's is an industry leader in marketing, selling, and helping fleets
manage CNG and RNG vehicles. At the federal level, incentives for these
fuels consist primarily of the Alternative Fuels Excise Tax Credit
(``AFTC'') and the RFS.
v. Solar and Onsite Power Generation
Love's provides full-service design, installation, and maintenance
for on-site solar and power generation projects, enabling customers to
reduce their energy bills and improve resiliency. At the federal level,
the Investment Tax Credit (``ITC'') is the most important incentive for
solar technology. Additionally, ``net metering'' throughout the country
drives solar economics by crediting solar energy system owners for the
electricity they add to the grid.
vi. Clean Hydrogen
Hydrogen is a zero-emission fuel that is used in fuel cell
vehicles. Love's is an industry leader in developing hydrogen vehicle
fueling stations and is continuing to expand its portfolio. At the
federal level, the ``45V'' clean hydrogen production tax credit, along
with the DOT's CFI grant program and the Department of Energy's
``Hydrogen Hubs'' investments comprise the primary financial incentives
for hydrogen investment.
Our experience at Love's is similar to that of dozens of other
retail fuel companies across the United States. As an industry, we have
adapted in response to policy incentives to sell lower carbon intensity
fuels. Our customers have benefited from our industry's ability to
offer a suite of refueling options.
III. Fuel Retailers Are Eager To Be Collaborative Partners in
Decarbonizing Transportation
To be most effective and expeditious, decarbonization efforts
should incentivize (rather than mandate) the private sector to invest
in the desired refueling technologies. Any alternative, including
electricity, should be offered in an open, competitive market that
gives American consumers the fullest economic benefits of robust price
competition. The market is extraordinarily capable of efficiently and
expeditiously bringing the lowest-cost fuels to market. Conversely, it
is stubbornly reluctant to consume more expensive or less convenient
alternative fuels.
Because we are fuel agnostic, fuel retailers are surrogates for the
consumer and invaluable partners for policymakers whose objectives
include increasing consumption of alternative fuels. We believe more of
our consumers will demand electricity as a fuel over the coming years,
and we want to be able to sell consumers whatever fuel they want to
purchase.
A. Technology-Neutrality
Our industry has ample experience bringing alternative fuels
(including electricity) to market. Based on that experience, it is
abundantly clear that clean fuel policies must assess low-carbon fuels
and vehicle technologies comprehensively. Different technologies should
compete with one another to reduce emissions and appeal to consumers.
This will maximize our chances of expeditiously achieving desired
environmental and economic outcomes. Proven decarbonization
technologies such as biofuels, for example, can deliver material
emissions and fuel economy improvements using existing infrastructure,
existing vehicles, and working within consumers' existing behavior. We
cannot ignore policies that incentivize these low carbon solutions.
NATSO and SIGMA encourage policymakers, including federal agencies,
to take a technology-neutral approach to decarbonization. Incentives
for alternative fuel technologies should be tied to those technologies'
lifecycle environmental attributes rather than the underlying
technology itself. No one solution will decarbonize transportation
energy. The best solution today may be surpassed by subsequent
ingenuity and innovation. Mandating a specific technology will
ultimately stifle innovation and progress rather than advance it. A
single technology approach also undermines energy security.
Less expensive, low-carbon solutions for today can be pursued
alongside more aspirational objectives for the future. Policymakers
should leverage existing infrastructure to encourage customers to
gravitate to new types of fuels and vehicles.\3\ Love's and the rest of
NATSO and SIGMA's membership and our upstream partners in the pipeline
and terminal industries have spent more than sixty years building out a
refueling infrastructure that optimizes logistics and maximizes
consumer benefits. Deployment of new technology that compliments,
rather than competes with, this infrastructure will (all else being
equal) be less expensive and thus more likely to ensure consumer
satisfaction.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ This applies both to real estate sites for EV charging
stations--where it is more efficient to leverage existing refueling
sites and driver amenities rather than building new ones--as well as
the broader energy and supply chain landscape (e.g., leveraging the
existing energy pipeline network rather than building a new one).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the heavy-duty long-haul space, for example, we believe that the
commercial and emission-reduction opportunities in hydrogen are more
crystallized and compelling than is the case with electricity.
Transitioning to battery electric trucks would adversely impact
commercial trucking operations by extending refueling times and
injecting a patchwork of electricity tariffs and regulations into what
today is an efficient private commercial trucking market. It also
requires expensive grid upgrades, with uncertain time horizons and
fluid cost projections. Hydrogen used in over-the-road trucking, on the
other hand, could leverage existing refueling infrastructure and a
supply chain familiar to the industry--centralized production,
transportation to market and retail fuel sales through a nationwide
network of well-functioning and convenient refueling locations. In
addition, the time it takes to refuel a hydrogen truck is similar to
the time it takes to refuel a diesel truck, causing minimal operational
disruptions compared with battery electric trucks that take longer to
refuel.
When addressing transportation emissions and their contribution to
climate change, there are no perfect answers. All vehicles have
emissions associated with their manufacture and use. In order to
understand the benefits and costs of any clean fuel policy, we need to
examine and account for the full lifecycle emissions of all alternative
fuels and vehicle technologies and where possible harness the
infrastructure that is at our disposal.
IV. Barriers to EV Charging Investments and Federal Efforts To Overcome
Them
A. Fuel Retailers are the Solution to Range Anxiety
Observers of vehicle trends and consumer behavior agree that one of
the major factors deterring consumers from transitioning to EVs is
concern about where they will (and will not) be able to ``refuel''
those vehicles.\4\ This ``range anxiety'' is such a strong sentiment
that consumers often decidedly underestimate the availability of EV
charging infrastructure that already exists today. The widespread
availability of EV charging advertised on the familiar large price
signs at fuel retailers' locations as motorists drive down the streets
in their communities and traverse America's highways will effectively
relieve EV range anxiety.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ The extent to which EV penetration is outpacing public charging
station deployment is changing the landscape of the EV market. A 2022
national, representative survey by Consumer Reports and the University
of Chicago found that 61 percent of Americans point to ``not enough
public charging stations'' as the primary issue preventing them from
buying or leasing an EV. In fact, 2022 was the first year in which the
study found that `access to charging' exceeded `upfront cost' as the
greatest barrier to consumers purchasing an EV. The same survey found
that 45 percent of Americans say that easy access to public fast-
charging stations would be the most likely variable to affirmatively
encourage them to buy or lease an EV. See Consumer Reports, ``Battery
Electric Vehicles and Low Carbon Fuel: Overview of Methodology,'' April
2022, available at https://article.images.consumerreports.org/prod/
content/dam/surveys/
Consumer_Reports_BEV%20AND%20LCF%20SURVEY_18_FEBRUARY_2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To have any chance at success, the refueling experience for
alternative fuels should be as similar as possible to today's refueling
experience and offer the services and amenities that consumers have
come to expect alongside such a network (e.g., security, foodservice
facilities, restrooms, lighting, etc.). Fuel retailers are best
positioned to provide alternative sources of transportation energy
because we have a keen understanding of on-the-go refueling preferences
based on decades of studying them. This fact is essential when it comes
to adoption of EVs or other alternative fuel vehicles, where what has
been a quick ``fill-up'' becomes a 30-minute charging experience.\5\
Fuel retailers who seek to maintain their share of the market will be
forced to compete on the services and amenities they offer during this
experience. This is a positive market dynamic for consumers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ Currently, it takes the driver of a passenger vehicle
approximately two to three minutes to complete a refueling experience.
It takes the driver of an EV, on the other hand, 20 to 40 minutes to
recharge at a Direct Current Fast Charger (``DCFC''), depending upon
the vehicle and the capacity of the charger available, as well as how
many other EVs are recharging at the specific site.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
B. EV Charging Needs Price Competition
Our industry provides approximately 125,000 locations across the
country for drivers to refuel. This refueling capacity drives
aggressive price competition which, in turn, keeps prices as low as
possible for consumers. Consumers know how much a gallon of gas costs
at a location--either due to a big price sign on the street or some
type of fuel price comparison resource on a mobile device--before they
decide to refuel. This forces retailers to shave every penny they can
off of the price of a gallon of fuel to compete for market share. EV
drivers should get the benefits of that remarkable price competition.
Recently enacted federal incentives have prompted fuel retailers to
devote increasing resources to exploring EV charging business
opportunities. Through that process, we have engaged with electric
utilities to ascertain the viability of installing the requisite
electrical infrastructure to accommodate multiple fast chargers at a
particular site. We have also engaged with automakers and commercial
fleets to better understand the likely demand curve for EV charging
services.
The unambiguous story we are being told by these various segments
of the value chain is that the pace at which this new technology will
penetrate the market is inconsistent with the timelines adopted by the
Biden Administration. Although the obstacles present today can
undoubtedly be overcome by innovation or other market developments, in
our pursuit of clean energy we should resist the temptation to abandon
realistic timelines and expectations. Congress cannot disregard less
comprehensive yet nevertheless environmentally compelling solutions
that can be pursued while a longer process unfolds.
At the moment, there are several impediments that make it
challenging for private businesses to identify a pathway to
profitability with respect to EV charging. Most of these impediments
involve an electricity market structure that was not designed for--and
is incompatible with--the retail fuel market. Foremost among these
market impediments is antiquated electricity pricing schemes that many
utilities are reluctant to modernize for purposes of EV charging
stations. Some states are exacerbating this problem by allowing
utilities to pass through the costs of EV charging stations to all of
the utilities' respective customers on monthly utility bills, rather
than having EV drivers pay for the costs of refueling their own
vehicles. On the other hand, several states are beginning to forbid
this practice in order to catalyze private investment (comparable to
the developments over the last decade by which states began permitting
non-utilities to sell electricity to EV drivers).\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ Recently, Nebraska became the final state to allow non-
utilities to sell electricity to EV drivers and included in that
legislation guardrails to prompt competition in electricity rate
structures. NATSO and SIGMA support legislative efforts such as this
and encourage FHWA to further leverage the NEVI program to not just
invest public funds, but to drive policies that will shape the future
of EV charging markets.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perhaps of greatest import, there are no purchasing options or
pricing structures for retailers to provide electricity as a fuel.
There are generally no wholesale purchasing options or pricing
structures for retailers to provide electricity as a fuel. Retailers
with EV chargers today are forced to pay retail prices for electricity
with very high demand charges.\7\ There is no business case for buying
electricity at retail prices and selling electricity at retail prices.
If this continues and becomes the prevalent model, this country will
risk replacing one of the most price-transparent and price-competitive
consumer markets in the world (retail fuel pricing) with one of the
least price-transparent and price-competitive markets in the United
States (utility electricity pricing).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ A demand charge is an amount added to a monthly utility bill
that is not based on the amount of electricity used by that business.
Instead, the charge typically is based on the highest rate of usage the
business has during the two 15-minute periods in a month in which the
business draws electricity from the grid at the highest pace. Fast EV
chargers inevitably prompt exceedingly high demand charges. This can
add thousands of dollars to a fuel retailer's monthly utility bill that
it cannot possibly recover from drivers charging their cars.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Businesses in our industry are making these investments today, but
we are struggling to make a profitable return on our investments.
Instead, we are using this opportunity to learn about the market in
anticipation of future growth. It is a mistake to assume that the
presence of EV chargers at our locations today means that market
problems have been solved. We have a long way to go to ensure there is
a business case for EV charging investments such that the
infrastructure can be built to the scale that is needed to support
future EV drivers.
C. Our Experience With the NEVI Program
The retail fuel industry supports the NEVI program and is actively
participating in the program in almost every state. The industry's
collective experience with NEVI over the last year has varied greatly
from state to state, however. The divergent approaches among the
various states threaten NEVI's long-term success. The market simply
cannot build an efficient network of charging stations across the
continental United States if the business case for installing chargers
varies drastically from state-to-state. We believe Federal Highway
Administration (``FHWA'') should be far less accommodating of such a
balkanized approach to EV charging markets; instead, it should more
assertively demand consumer-centric uniformity across the states as it
considers each respective state's EV charging plan. FHWA should use the
NEVI program as an opportunity to prompt state-level policy reforms
that are necessary to create a robust, ubiquitous market for EV
charging.
Specifically, public investments in fast charging stations should
require site hosts to be financially motivated to offer positive
consumer experiences. This incentive to provide a positive consumer
experience should emanate from revenue that is realized when charging
stations are utilized (as opposed to deployed). NEVI dollars can go the
furthest when they mobilize grant recipients to not only install
charging stations but to provide an ongoing, positive consumer
experience for EV drivers even after the NEVI program lapses.
a. Importance of Prioritizing Amenities
The more attractive and ubiquitous this experience is for
consumers, the more comfortable they will be buying EVs. This, in turn,
will further incentivize charging station investments even in the
absence of government support. States that recognize and prioritize the
importance of the consumer experience (e.g., Ohio, Pennsylvania) are
installing chargers alongside driver amenities. Other states conducted
only high-level assessments of surrounding amenities; in those states
far fewer of the awards were co-located with 24-7 amenities, despite
being sited in close proximity to 24-7 locations. There is no reason
for such disparate approaches and outcomes to be embedded in a grant
program that is designed to create a single, harmonious network of EV
charging stations.
b. Executed Site-Host Agreements
It is also essential that states do not issue grant awards to
applicants without committed site host agreements with site owners.
States have seen proposals with candidate sites that rely upon future
infrastructure or development; this creates a significant risk that
those developments may not advance as anticipated.\8\ Instead, states
should be required to conduct detailed, in-person assessments of a
grantee's proposed site. Awarding grants to applicants without executed
site agreements not only risks allotting funding to projects that will
not come to fruition, it encourages entities like charging station
companies (including Tesla) to find less stable, but more passive, site
host arrangements to simplify commercial relationships. (In one
instance, a NEVI grant was awarded to an applicant who plans to site
the chargers at a liquor store.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ See, e.g., Ohio Department of Transportation RFP #556-23,
Proposal Debrief (August 1, 2023) (``Claims regarding hours of
accessibility to restrooms for certain businesses (e.g., hotels) were
not accurate due to time and manner restrictions (e.g., doors were
locked at certain times and required room keys for access). . . .
Proposed site amenities were often at ``off-site'' businesses that were
not accessibly using pedestrian-friendly infrastructure (e.g.,
sidewalks, signalized crossings, etc.).'')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
c. Capping Rate of Returns
FHWA should not allow states to issue caps on rate-of-return. Some
have instituted an artificial cap on returns on investment (with
``excess'' funds remitted to the states' respective department of
transportation). These guardrails might make sense for traditional
infrastructure projects, but they do not for programs designed to
incentivize private investment to flow to a nascent market. Caps on the
rate of return are dissuading private businesses from applying for NEVI
grants in states that institute them. A competitive market does not
accommodate uncompetitive pricing; such pricing would invite new market
entrants to offer a more attractive proposition to consumers. (This,
incidentally, is how the existing retail fuel industry was built.).
When charging becomes more profitable as utilization rates increase,
NEVI awardees will be at a competitive disadvantage relative to
privately funded chargers. Placing a cap on returns will also mean that
less revenue will be available for future upgrades and dissuade the
retailer from reinvesting profits back into charging capacity to keep
up with competition (e.g., investing in faster charging speeds or the
installation of additional chargers.)
d. Overly Restrictive Evaluation Areas
FHWA should dissuade states from unnecessarily restricting
evaluation areas. Some states, for example, use a ``grouping'' approach
to their NEVI awards: Instead of rewarding the best individual sites,
these states will award a whole highway segment to one bidder. This
approach makes it virtually impossible for consumer-oriented fuel
retailers who are inextricably tethered to fixed real estate to apply;
grants will inevitably be awarded to charging station networks and/or
public utilities that will have little financial incentive to create a
positive consumer charging experience.
e. Adequate Response Time
Finally, FHWA should ensure that states provide adequate response
time for grant solicitations (90-120 days is appropriate); establish
clear grant application expectations and engage in open communication
with potential applications in advance (e.g., hosting webinars before
releasing a grant solicitation); offer one-on-one meetings before, and
throughout, the grant solicitation process; and provide easy access to
maps of locations being evaluated for potential awards. There should be
as much uniformity as possible between the grant application processes
from state-to-state.
V. Conclusion
Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today. On
behalf of NATSO and SIGMA, I look forward to continuing to work with
Congress on these issues, and am happy to answer any questions you may
have.

Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Ms. Okafor. Very well done.
Before we introduce our second witness, I want to recognize
Representative Ezell to give a short introduction.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I am excited about today, being here, and pleased to honor
and introduce one of our witnesses, a lifetime resident of
Mississippi's Fourth Congressional District with over 47 years
of private and public experience in ground transportation, my
friend, Mr. Kevin Coggin.
Mr. Coggin has a passion for improving transit across the
country and has worked in the industry since his high school
graduation. In 1989, he joined the Coast Transit Authority as
director of the maintenance department, where his leadership
skills and personality quickly made him a company standout. It
took less than two decades before he would be picked by his
peers to run the Coast Transit Authority, CTA, as the executive
director.
Today, Mr. Coggin boasts 47 years of experience--he is only
50--in the industry, and he has just done a wonderful job. As
anyone familiar with south Mississippi knows, this includes
experiences essential for navigating devastating natural
disasters, operating tight financial budgets, and finding ways
to connect individuals across our hospitality State.
I am excited my colleagues on this committee can learn from
leaders in my home district. Again, I would like to welcome Mr.
Coggin and thank him for agreeing--and thank the committee for
inviting him here--to testify at the subcommittee hearing
today.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Ezell.
Mr. Coggin, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF KEVIN COGGIN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COAST TRANSIT
AUTHORITY, ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY TRANSPORTATION
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA

Mr. Coggin. Subcommittee Chairman Crawford and Ranking
Member Norton, thank you for this opportunity to discuss public
transit fleet electrification efforts.
I am Kevin Coggin, executive director of Coast Transit
Authority in Gulfport, Mississippi.
Coast Transit is a midsized urban transportation system
serving the three coastal counties of Mississippi, in addition
to connecting three bordering States. I am here representing
more than 1,200 Community Transportation Association of America
members, the majority of which operate rural, small city, and
Tribal transit systems.
In my 47 years of experience in the private and public
transportation industry, including 35 years managing
alternative fuel vehicle operations, I have been through
hurricanes, economic recessions, oilspills, and the pandemic. I
have served in my current role for 21 years and was director
when Hurricane Katrina made landfall in the middle of our
service area.
Coast Transit provides fixed route, on demand, and work
commute services commonly known as vanpool. This year,
ridership in our system is back to pre-pandemic levels. We are
projected to provide 775,000 trips in fiscal year 2024.
Operations are funded by the FTA, local and State governments,
and self-generated income. We operate our agency without an
annual operating deficit.
Coast Transit plays a vital role in the daily lives of our
ridership. Our riders rely on our system to bring them to work,
school, medical facilities, essential locations like
supermarkets, and tourism attractions.
Coast Transit has a mixed fleet of 54 vehicles. We choose
low-emission propane in our small to midsized vehicles and
hybrid or zero-emission battery-electric for our large heavy-
duty buses. We are currently replacing all of our aging diesel
buses with cleaner alternatives.
A mixed fleet is our solution to balancing cost, system
effectiveness, and resiliency in reaching our sustainability
goals. And that is the most important message I will bring to
you today.
Smaller transit operators like mine and those represented
by CTAA all around the country need flexibility to make
decisions at a local level based on geography, weather, and
service. Coast Transit will meet a 50-percent emission
reduction by 2030 with our mixed fleet of vehicles. Electric is
part of our plan, but we cannot commit to pure electric.
In 2021, we purchased one 35-foot battery-electric bus for
$800,000. The same vehicle today would cost my agency $1.2
million. We have 12 small buses currently on order to arrive in
the next year, all of which are propane-fueled.
Systems need choices. Our battery-electric buses work well
within the confines of our fixed route, but current price and
range issues make this technology much less effective and
unsustainably expensive for the other parts of our service.
Public transportation is already reducing overall emissions
by lowering the number of vehicles on the road. We must avoid
any Federal mandates requiring the adoption of only zero-
emission technologies and continue to allow eligibility for
low-emission vehicles that make sense in my community and
thousands more like it across the Nation.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's investment in public
transit, as well as the flexibility and funding, both low- and
zero-emission buses, has helped us build back our ridership,
acquire new equipment, and complete important local capital
projects.
As Congress begins to look at surface transportation policy
to follow the BIL, I ask that you consider the impact of the
extraordinary price increases of zero-emission technologies on
local support for vital public transit in smaller cities and
rural areas.
Coming up with 15 percent or 20 percent local match on
buses, both large and small, when prices have nearly doubled in
the past few years is a big challenge for CTA and many other
CTAA members. It strains the local budgets of the communities
we serve. Most of our riders are not interested in the
specifics of our buses, but they value reliability, reduced
noise, especially in those coastal routes, and our dedication
to promoting a healthy environment and community through
readily available flexible public transportation.
Thank you for the opportunity to discuss fleet
electrification and public transit with you today. I look
forward to answering questions from committee members.
[Mr. Coggin's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Kevin Coggin, Executive Director, Coast Transit
Authority, on behalf of the Community Transportation Association of
America
Coast Transit Authority (CTA) is a mid-sized 5307 urban public
transit agency providing various types of transportation services in
the Gulf Coast region of Mississippi. CTA serves the Gulfport Urbanized
Zone Area (UZA) that has a population of 215,000+ and encompasses three
counties and seven cities. CTA also serves the Pascagoula UZA with a
population of 50,000+. CTA is the direct recipient of Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) 5307, 5310, and 5339a funding for the Gulfport
Urbanized Zone Area. CTA is the designated recipient FTA 5307 and 5339a
funding for the Pascagoula UZA. The CTA service area does not have
serious air quality issues and is not in a non-attainment area.
Mr. Kevin Coggin, the current Executive Director, has been managing
fleet acquisition, maintenance, and operations since his employment at
CTA began in September 1989. He was named Executive Director of CTA in
2003 and helped steer the agency through Hurricane Katrina's
devastating impact in 2005, while supporting the areas evacuation and
relief efforts. CTA's approach to fleet acquisition is to acquire
vehicles that will meet the operational service needs and implement
alternative fuel technologies to gradually reduce emissions over time.
During this time span CTA has closely watched the advancement of engine
and alternative fuel technologies and assessed what technologies are
appropriate for CTA. The initial acquisition cost; and life cycle
operating costs of vehicles are key. The cost of building and operating
on-site fuel facilities is also a major consideration.
The Community Transportation Association of America (CTAA) is a
national nonprofit association of more than 1,200 organizations and
individuals who believe that mobility is a basic human right. Mobility
directly impacts the quality of life of people in communities across
the nation by providing access to work and education to life-sustaining
health care and human services programs to shopping and visiting with
family and friends. CTAA members are in the business of moving people
efficiently and cost-effectively. CTAA staff, board and state/tribal
delegates are dedicated to ensuring that all Americans, regardless of
age, ability, geography or income, have access to safe, affordable and
reliable transportation.
Fixed-Route Bus Services
CTA currently operates a fixed-route bus service system along eight
routes using 15 buses that operate seven days a week serving the St.
Martin community in Jackson County, the cities of Ocean Springs,
D'Iberville, Biloxi, and Gulfport. The fixed-route bus service is
projected to provide 665,000 trips in FY 2024. CTA fixed-route
ridership is 55 percent daily riders, 25 percent work-related, 23
percent shopping. Eighty percent of our passengers do not own a car,
and 71 percent earn less than $25,000 a year. CTA has a diverse
ridership base consisting of workers, retirees, seniors, and tourists.
The majority of CTA fixed-route local citizen ridership are the working
poor that do not own a car.
Demand-Response Services
CTA provides a variety of transportation services in the demand-
response category. Eighteen vehicles of various sizes and types are
used to provide these services. Within this demand-response service,
CTA provides senior citizen transportation for the Harrison County and
Hancock County seniors programs. Transportation is provided for daily
trips to Senior Citizen Centers, medical appointments, and grocery
shopping. This service is projected to provide 31,500 trips in FY2024.
These services allow our senior citizens to maintain independence and
wellbeing.
CTA provides fixed-route related complimentary ADA paratransit
service. Riders living within three-quarters of a mile of an existing
fixed route who have a disability that prevents them from using fixed-
route service are eligible to use this curb-to-curb service. This
service is projected to provide 6,100 trips in FY2024.
CTA provides an ADA Plus service. In addition to the complimentary
ADA service, CTA provides service for people with disabilities who live
in the rural areas of Jackson and Harrison counties. This service is
projected to provide 4,800 trips in FY2024.
CTA provides contract services for access to health care. CTA
contracts with local mental and physical health care providers to
transport their patients to and from health care facilities. This
service is projected to provide 22,500 trips in FY2024.
CTA provides hurricane evacuation services. CTA is a member of the
Harrison County Emergency Management Agency and is the designated ESF-1
manager in the Emergency Operations Center. Emergency Support Function
1 (ESF-1) plays a crucial role in coordinating transportation-related
activities during emergencies and disasters. CTA is responsible for
providing evacuation transportation for all residents of Harrison
County in the event of a hurricane or tropical storm.
Work Commute Services
The CTA Coast Commuter work commute service is a transportation
service provided by private contractor Enterprise Commute. It is a
turnkey service with Enterprise providing all management, operations,
and vehicles. Coast Commuter provides work commute service along the I-
10 corridor bringing workers into Mississippi and reverse commute out
of Mississippi in the areas of the panhandle of Florida and the lower
areas of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Thirty-three vehicles are
currently in operation consisting of a combination of SUVs, minivans,
and 15-passenger vans. Coast Commuter is projected to provide 75,000
work related trips in FY2024. In addition to providing work commuters
with a low-cost, safe, dependable work transportation option, it has a
positive impact on reducing vehicle pollution.

CTA's Vehicle Fleet
To meet all of its operational demands CTA operates a fleet of 46
revenue vehicles and 8 support vehicles. The fleet includes various
vehicle sizes and types of fuel. The revenue fleet consists of vans,
small cut-a-way (body-on-chassis) buses, medium-sized trolley buses,
and 30,, 35,, 40, heavy-duty buses. The current fuels used are
gasoline, diesel, propane hybrid electric, diesel hybrid electric, and
battery electric bus. Today, 20 percent of the fleet is gas engine, 52
percent are diesel engine, 27 percent are propane fuel engine, and 1
percent is battery electric. Twelve new propane buses are currently on
order to replace diesel buses. The reason for this diversity of vehicle
types and fuels is due to budgetary constraints, historical phase-in of
alternative fuel technologies, and, more recently, lack of availability
of vehicles due to supply chain issues.
The Future CTA Fleet
CTA's long-range plan is to phase out all diesel-engine and
gasoline-engine revenue vehicles. They will be replaced with either
low-emission or zero-emission vehicles. Small cut-a-way (body-on-
chassis) buses and trolley buses will be propane-fueled and large
heavy-duty buses will be either hybrid electric or battery-electric
zero emission.
CTA chose propane for support and small medium sized revenue
vehicles for the following reasons.

The initial cost is less than battery electric vehicles
(BEB). BEB vehicles cost significantly more than low-emission buses;
they require expensive chargers; and improved (and costly) main
electric supply feeds to chargers.

There are no range issues like those associated with
battery electric.

There is no cost to CTA for the on-site fueling
infrastructure.

Life cycle operating costs of fuel and maintenance are
significantly less than diesel engine vehicles.

It allows CTA to fully meet its goal of reducing tail
pipe emissions by 50 percent by 2030 in a cost-efficient manner.
Considerations for the Subcommittee
As the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's Highways
and Transit Subcommittee begins to look at reauthorizing the nation's
surface transportation policies, Mr. Coggin and the Community
Transportation Association of America ask that the following policy
recommendations be considered.
Public Transit has Always Been a Leader in Emissions Reduction--
Increased investment in all forms of public transit is the best way to
lower emissions. Every day, Coast Transit Authority reduces the number
of personal vehicles on the roads throughout its service area. CTA's
ability to lower local tailpipe emissions is best demonstrated by
filling up the seats on our vehicles.
No Federal Mandates--Please continue to allow for local decision
making by public transit systems whose leadership and Boards best
understand their communities and their passengers. There are a variety
of ways that transit agencies of all sizes can (and do) lower
emissions. One-size-fits-all approaches that mandate any single type of
zero or low-emission technology disregards system budgets, local
emergency management requirements, local energy availability, rolling
stock availability and many additional factors.
Continue Investing in Both Low- and Zero-Emission Buses--Small and
mid-sized transit agencies around the nation like CTA need viable
vehicle options. Operationally, many transit agencies operating outside
dense, urban areas routinely provide trips that exceed the current
range of battery-electric vehicles; smaller city, rural and tribal
areas do not yet have adequate charging infrastructure; and, cost-
effective battery electric smaller buses are not widely available
today. Please continue to set aside a minimum of 25 percent of Section
5339c grant funds for propane, CNG and hybrid vehicles that allow
smaller transit operators the ability to reduce emissions in cost-
effective, operationally-sound ways. CTAA is concerned that the
availability of low-emission vehicles, which many of its members
effectively operate around the country, is threatened by the dramatic
reduction in transit vehicle manufacturers. Additionally, it is vital
to not only continue--but to grow--dedicated federal investment in bus
purchases. In the past two funding cycles, the Federal Transit
Administration has received a total of more than $16 billion in bus
funding requests for $3.3 billion in available funding.
Help with Local Match--Smaller city, rural and tribal transit
operators are struggling to find the required local share to match the
federal investment to properly maintain a state of good repair within
their vehicle fleets. The extraordinary price increases the industry
has seen, particularly for zero-emission buses, places even greater
strain on already strained local funding sources.

Mr. Crawford. Excellent. Very well done. Right on time.
Probably not by accident, right?
Mr. Darakos, you are recognized for 5 minutes for your
testimony.

TESTIMONY OF TAKI DARAKOS, VICE PRESIDENT OF VEHICLE
MAINTENANCE AND FLEET SERVICE, PITT OHIO, ON BEHALF OF THE
AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSOCIATIONS

Mr. Darakos. Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Norton, and
members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to
testify today. My name is Taki Darakos, and I am the vice
president of vehicle maintenance and fleet service at PITT
OHIO.
PITT OHIO is a freight transportation provider that
operates in 14 States out of 25 depots and employs more than
3,500 people. Our fleet consists of over 1,550 company-owned
tractors and boxtrucks.
Trucking has a positive story to tell about the progress we
have made to reduce emissions, and PITT OHIO is tremendously
proud to be a part of it. We have a longstanding commitment to
environmental responsibility on behalf of our employees,
customers, and the communities where we operate.
Over the past several decades, trucking has cut nitrogen
oxide and particulate matter tailpipe emissions by a stunning
99 percent. As a result, 60 of today's trucks emit what just 1
truck did in 1988. This progress was made possible through
innovation and collaboration. A joint effort between the EPA
and the trucking industry established aggressive yet achievable
targets on realistic timelines.
For this reason, PITT OHIO joined many industry
stakeholders in supporting the Federal phase 1 and phase 2
greenhouse gas emissions regulations. These rules achieve
carbon emissions improvements, as well as deliver real-world
fuel savings by using proven technologies. Regrettably, EPA's
phase 3 regulations released this year break from that history
of successful partnership. This unworkable mandate ignores
operational realities and places a costly burden on trucking
companies.
Currently, there are extremely limited quantities of
battery-electric trucks on the road. In fact, less than 1
percent of trucks registered on the road today are zero-
emission trucks. In 2022, after meticulous evaluation and
planning with our truck manufacturer, we put into service our
first battery-electric trucks. They cost 2\1/2\ to 3\1/2\ times
more than traditional diesel-powered units, and that excludes
charging infrastructure.
Although battery-electric trucks show promise in certain
applications, it is apparent that they are not ready for broad
deployment due to technology limitations. PITT OHIO clean-
diesel tractors average 650 to 700 miles per day, and our
boxtrucks average 150 to 200 miles per day. The range is not
there to support our tractor fleet, which is where the majority
of our vehicle-miles are driven.
These battery-electric vehicle trucks also require long
periods of unproductive downtime to recharge, and transport
less cargo due to the massive weight of their battery packs.
These limitations contrast unfavorably with clean-diesel power
trains that can refuel in 15 minutes anywhere in the country
and drive 1,200 miles. Battery-electric trucks also require
enormous amounts of energy. Just one truck depot could require
the same amount of electricity needed to power an entire town.
Delivering this power is another challenge. Supporting a
NEVI fleet would require the construction of numerous
powerplants and transmission lines, not to mention the
installation of at least 15,000 truck charging stations every
month between now and 2032. For contrast, the fastest chargers
cost $100,000 each.
A recent study commissioned by the Clean Freight Coalition
calculated full electrification of the commercial vehicle
industry would cost $1 trillion for charging infrastructure and
utility investment. Fortunately, there are many alternatives
that can be taken to zero emissions. Clean natural gas,
hydrogen, renewable diesel, hybrids, and other bridge
technologies can all be part of decarbonization.
Congress should prioritize the carrot-over-a-stick approach
by incentivizing truck owners to upgrade to the newest,
cleanest models. A newly manufactured truck produces half the
CO2 emissions of one manufactured in 2010.
Trucking is accustomed to overcoming challenges, but we
cannot address these problems if policymakers ignore them or
mandate one straightjacket solution. PITT OHIO and our industry
have demonstrated that we are wholeheartedly committed to
reducing emissions, but it is important that we get this
transition right.
Trucking is the backbone of our supply chain. Setting us up
for failure will have dire consequences for our economy and
American consumers.
Thank you for allowing me to speak today, and I look
forward to answering your questions.

Prepared Statement of Taki Darakos, Vice President of Vehicle
Maintenance and Fleet Service, PITT OHIO, on behalf of the American
Trucking Associations
Introduction
Subcommittee Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Norton, and Members
of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on
behalf of the American Trucking Associations (ATA). ATA is a 90-year-
old federation and the largest national trade organization representing
the 8.4 million Americans working in trucking-related jobs. The
organization is a fifty-state federation that encompasses 37,000 motor
carriers and their suppliers, working in all sectors of the industry,
from less-than-truckload (LTL) to truckload, refrigerated transport for
food and beverage and life sciences, intermodal trucking, auto haulage,
and household goods movement.
Members of ATA range in size from the nation's largest motor
carriers to mom-and-pop one-truck operations. These companies move
goods nationwide, in a competitive industry that is faced with steep
regulatory cost increases stemming from new emission regulations
implemented by the State of California and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), like the recently finalized Greenhouse Gas
(GHG) Phase 3 regulation. The diversity of the industry means that
successful regulations need to be technology-neutral and cannot be one-
size-fits-all. ATA opposes the new GHG Phase 3 rule because the post-
2030 targets are unachievable given the current state of zero-emission
technology, the lack of charging infrastructure, and restrictions on
the power grid.
The company I work for, PITT OHIO, is a regional motor carrier
offering less-than truckload, drayage, and logistics services. This
family-owned company has roots that stretch back to 1919. More
recently, in 1979, three brothers bought three trucks and leased a one-
door warehouse in East Liverpool, OH, to facilitate freight movements
between Pittsburgh and Ohio. Our company now employs over 3,500 people
and provides first-rate freight services across the mid-Atlantic and
midwestern U.S. As the company has grown from those humble beginnings,
our mission for environmental sustainability has grown as well. We
pride ourselves on being leaders in the movement towards cleaner, safer
freight transportation.
Our sustainability goals are reflected in our core values: people,
planet, and purpose. We believe that a focus on purpose--creating
innovative solutions for our customers and improving efficiencies in
our business--is good corporate citizenship. We are an active
participant in EPA's SmartWay program and a recipient of the Excellence
Award that recognizes the most fuel-efficient fleets in the country. We
have received Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
certifications for our warehouse facilities and have received multiple
awards such as a Top Green Fleet from Heavy Duty Trucking and a Top
Green Supply Chain Partner by Inbound Logistics magazines. In 2022 and
2023, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency presented our company
with a Gold award for Encouraging Environmental Excellence Stewardship.
As the Vice President of vehicle maintenance and fleet services, I
am responsible for managing the vehicle specifications, acquisitions,
and maintenance to support PITT OHIO's fleet of over 950 company-owned
tractors, 2,900 trailers, 600 straight trucks, 16 chassis, and other
vehicles. This is a demanding and fulfilling job that informs my
perspective on the challenges of electrifying our nation's commercial
trucking fleet. More than 80% of U.S. communities rely exclusively on
commercial trucking fleets like PITT OHIO's to meet their freight
transportation needs, and trucking currently moves more than 70% of the
nation's annual freight tonnage.\1\ Over the next decade, trucks will
be tasked with moving 2.4 billion more tons of freight than they do
today, and trucks will continue to deliver the vast majority of goods
to American communities.\2\ As we meet that growing demand, the
industry will continue experimenting with new technologies that fit
their business models and reduce overall emissions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am grateful for the chance to inform Congress, federal agencies,
and stakeholders about the opportunities and challenges for PITT OHIO
and our industry peers to reduce our environmental footprint while
serving our customers. Our industry association, ATA, works on our
behalf to spread the message that ambitious policy and regulatory goals
can be accompanied by achievable timelines for fleets of all sizes to
deliver emissions reductions without risking supply chain disruption.
It is a privilege to sit before you today, and I welcome our
discussion. The deployment of newer, cleaner heavy-duty trucks will
provide environmental benefits. To achieve these reductions, federal
policy and regulations need to reflect the unique operating and
technology-adoption drivers that provide business benefits for fleets.
To ensure adoption, technology must be proven with significant miles in
real-world conditions to ensure durability, performance, and cost
recovery of the investments. I hope that my testimony will be helpful
as the Committee works on achievable paths forward on electrification
and emissions reductions from the commercial vehicle industry.
Our Commitment to the Environment
PITT OHIO is not alone among our trucking peers in seeking to
proactively reduce emissions from our trucking fleet. Our industry has
a positive story to tell about the progress we have made. A new truck
today emits 99% fewer particulate matter emissions than one in 1985,
and 99% fewer nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions than one in 1975.\3\ In
fact, 60 trucks today emit what one truck emitted in 1988. These
cleaner trucks are meeting Americans' demands to move more freight than
ever before. Since 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)
SmartWay partners have saved billions of dollars in fuel costs, reduced
oil consumption, and eliminated millions of tons of air pollutants. EPA
estimates that the program has helped its partners save 379 million
barrels of oil since 2004.\4\ If one barrel of oil produces 11 to 12
gallons of diesel fuel, trucking companies participating in the
SmartWay program have saved more than 4 billion gallons of fuel--over
$18 billion at current prices--in the last nineteen years.\5\ Fuel
savings have directly resulted in critical emissions reductions of
nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter, in addition to millions of
metric tons of CO2.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trucking began phasing out harmful sulfur from diesel fuel in 2006,
practically eliminating sulfur oxide emissions. ATA also championed two
separate EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
regulations in 2011 and 2016, establishing the first-ever truck engine
and vehicle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and fuel consumption
standards--known as Phase 1 and 2, respectively. In total, between 2014
and 2027, the combined Phase 1 and 2 GHG standards stand to cut CO2
emissions by 1.37 billion metric tons, saving vehicle owners and
operators $220 billion in fuel costs and reducing oil consumption by up
to 2.5 billion barrels of oil over the lifetime of the vehicles sold
under the program.\6\

Standards and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty
Engines and Vehicles,'' October 2016.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ATA and the trucking industry proactively engaged with the EPA
throughout the drafting and comment period for the new Phase 3 GHG
rulemaking. Setting ambitious, achievable, and technology neutral
standards under that new regulation was a top priority. Requiring
early-stage technology that has not been fully validated will fail to
deliver environmental results in the expected regulatory timeframe
under the current GHG Phase 3 finalized regulation. EPA's work should
focus on the national needs and not on California, which will be forced
to readjust its flawed regulations to reflect reality. Trucking is a
willing partner in finding a path towards a zero emissions future that
reflects the diversity of our industry, not a one-size-fits-all
approach.
The Promise and Challenges of Medium- and Heavy-Duty Electrification
Over the past several years, PITT OHIO has taken steps to meet
demand for lower-carbon deliveries. Beginning in 2014 we introduced
compressed natural gas to our fleet. We have run over 21 million miles
with our natural gas fleet and have a good understanding of that
technology and what it takes to support it. We are looking forward to
the new engine technology recently released due to the perceived
improvement in performance, fuel economy and maintenance costs. PITT
OHIO has also introduced battery electric vehicles into our fleet to
better understand the technology. In 2022, we obtained our first Class
7 battery-electric trucks, which we operated on 100-mile regional
routes as part of our testing and validation process. We recently in-
serviced the second generation of these trucks and we are seeing
improved ranges and payloads, but these figures still fall short
compared to our ICE vehicles. Currently, the technology does not
support our tractor operations. During the day our tractors operate in
city operations running between 150-200 miles. At night they run
linehaul operations, averaging over 500 miles an evening with some
running over 600 miles. BEV technology will not allow for
electrification of those vehicles today. Although we continue to be
optimistic about the promise of electrification in medium- and heavy-
duty vehicles, we continue to encounter challenges related to costs,
vehicle range, durability, and charging infrastructure that complicate
broader deployment of heavy-duty battery-electric trucks.
Zero Emission Vehicles' (ZEV) upfront acquisition costs are much
higher than their diesel equivalent, making it difficult for fleets to
embrace electrification until they see meaningful year-over-year
upfront purchase price declines. Before incentives, a Class 7/8 battery
electric truck can cost two to three-and-a-half times more than its
comparable diesel model and a hydrogen fuel cell Class 8 truck can be
as much as seven times more.\7\ In our fleet, we have found acquisition
costs to be roughly three-fifths of the total cost of operation.\8\ For
many fleets like ours, that calculation is often complex and cannot be
done without significant trial and error and at great capital expense.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ Class 4-6 battery electric delivery vehicles can range from
$100,000 to $200,000, while Class 8 over-the-road vehicles can cost
$400,000 or more before incentives. Diesel MDV is around $75,000 and
HDV is $165,000.

Trucks' New Electromobility Total Cost of Ownership Tool Demonstrates
Financial, Environmental Benefits of Volvo VNR Electric,'' October 23,
2022; and Dana, Inc., Total Cost of Ownership Tool, n.d.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For our fleet, the process of adopting battery-electric trucks
required meticulous evaluation, planning, and collaboration with our
truck manufacturer partner before an order was even placed. After
deliberation, we settled on box trucks due to their range and payload
capacity. They were the closest fit to our current operation. We
carefully positioned these vehicles to not go beyond their
technological limitations. On some occasions, we were able to leverage
offsite charging to extend the range, however this was done at retail
sites not set up for truck parking/charging and not even close to
ideal. Increased vehicle weight from the batteries reduced our payload
and limited our usage of haul. These limitations have impacted the
company's timeline on how and when to transition to ZEV.
ATA conducted a survey of fleets that found most fleet respondents
were uncertain about ZEVs' residual value.\9\ With the rapid
technological changes in these vehicles, these early trucks will be
dinosaurs. Given the continued uncertainty around factors such as
energy prices, uptime, and residual value, the vehicle purchase price
must be significantly reduced to make the total cost of operation
comparable to using existing diesel engines. If fleets do not see the
expected financial benefit, they will be forced to hold onto their
existing equipment longer, resulting in an older fleet with a higher
emissions profile.

3 Member Survey,'' June 16, 2023
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vehicle purchase incentives can help reduce costs, and robust and
stable federal and state incentives that cover the entire cost of the
vehicle or cover the cost differential between a ZEV and diesel truck
can help support early adoption. Only a few states offer vehicle
purchase incentives, however, and the federal government's Commercial
Clean Vehicle Credit is capped at $40,000 for a ZEV, covering the
federal sales tax for vehicle purchases. In our case, we were able to
leverage funding through the state for a ZEV demonstration project to
help offset the increased vehicle costs and reduce some of our
infrastructure expenses. That said, it has been an incredibly long
process to add 3 megawatts of power at our Harrisburg, PA, facility.
This effort has involved many calls, e-mails and follow-ups with the
utility, along with engineering and construction firms that many
smaller organizations may not have access to or wonder where to even
start. When complete in early 2025 this power upgrade will have taken
two years. Had we asked for more power it would have pushed the lead
time to five years. And we are doing this ahead of the curve. Looking
over our network, we have 12 facilities that would make sense to start
the infrastructure upgrade process. At those 12 facilities, we will be
working with 10 different utility partners to make this happen.
Although incentives are sometimes available at the state level, wading
through numerous pages of funding applications is incredibly complex
for fleets and not simple or easy.
Despite our optimism about battery-electric vehicle technology, the
availability and reliability of charging stations are inhibitors to
adoption. Earlier this month, the Clean Freight Coalition (CFC)
published findings from a study conducted by Roland Berger examining
the required investment to fully electrify the trucking industry by
2040. Fleets would be expected to invest $620 billion for charging
infrastructure, with utilities needing an additional $370 billion for
grid upgrades.\10\ These costs represent an unsustainable financial
burden on trucking fleets to facilitate this technological transition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\10\ Clean Freight Coalition, ``New Report Pegs Cost of
Electrifying U.S. Commercial Truck Fleet at $1 Trillion,'' March 19,
2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The CFC study highlights some key realities for the trucking
industry. First, a fleet's optimal vehicle and charging profile largely
depend on its duty cycle. Assuming improved technology allows for a
250-mile usable range and on-route charging enhancements, a robust on-
route charging network will be essential for high-mileage medium-duty
and heavy-duty vehicles. Second, serious constraints exist on the
current grid, particularly concerning the power needs of medium- and
heavy-duty BEVs. This necessitates substantial investment, from
generation to distribution. As charging primarily occurs overnight,
introducing on-site charging will significantly alter daily electricity
load profiles, potentially straining current grid capacity--especially
in areas distant from urban infrastructure, where necessary upgrades
represent a greater cost and percentage of existing capacity.
Utilities will face challenges in upgrading infrastructure,
particularly in areas requiring entirely new infrastructure. Last year,
the American Transportation Research Institute calculated that
electrification of the entire U.S. vehicle fleet would consume an
astounding 40% of the country's existing electricity generation and
require a 14% overall increase in energy generation, yet our aging grid
can hardly meet current demands.\11\ In California, where rolling
blackouts and brownouts are not uncommon, utilities would need to
generate an additional 57% beyond their current output to support an
electric vehicle fleet.\12\ In some states, the staggering power
demands for heavy-duty truck charging could increase even as sources of
carbon-free power generation, such as hydropower facilities, are taken
offline or during the implementation of complicated statewide clean
power plans.

Conversations with utilities often reveal lengthy lead times for
electrical infrastructure upgrades. Forty percent of fleets surveyed by
ATA said that their utility estimated it would take at least a year
before they could provide the electricity to support battery-electric
trucks at their facilities, while 30 percent received wait time
estimates of over three years.\13\ We have facilities where without
significant upgrades we only have the power to support limited Level 2
charging. As an example, that Level 2 charger would take 10 hours to
charge a medium duty truck.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\ ATA Technology and Maintenance Council, ``Greenhouse Gas Phase
3 Member Survey,'' June 16, 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current regulatory targets for the deployment of battery-electric
vehicles are predicated on unprecedented advancements in battery range
and capacity, as well as a significant buildout of the national power
grid over years, not decades, which has historically been the case.
Mandates and targets for decarbonization of the PITT OHIO fleet, and
others across the industry, require acknowledgement of market realities
that both keep supply chains moving and enable fleets like mine to
affordably acquire and install infrastructure. Along with all my fleet
management peers, I would note that for me to deploy more battery-
electric or alternative fuel vehicles, it would require certainty that
the infrastructure to support that investment is affordable, available,
and compatible with my purchase.
The Value of Achievable, Neutral, Federal Standards
Trucking companies traverse state lines multiple times a day, and a
strong national emissions framework ensures the continuity of our
nation's freight networks. ATA strongly advocates for federal emissions
regulations to ensure that interstate commerce continues to move
unimpeded. State-based emissions regulations that increase the cost of
trucks--or mandate the deployment of zero-emission trucks--while the
technology is still in early-stage development disrupt the business
operations of our industry and make it harder for us to meet the needs
of our customers--your constituents. Absent federal standards for
emissions reductions, companies transporting freight interstate will be
forced to reconfigure their business operations, which will increase
complexity and the costs of doing business.
For this reason, ATA has opposed state-based regulations such as
those promulgated by the California Air Resources Board and joined by
other states that would mandate the sale and purchase of zero emission
technology under aggressive timelines. California's Advanced Clean
Trucks (ACT) and Advanced Clean Fleet (ACF) rules are designed to move
the commercial vehicle industry as quickly as possible towards zero
emission technology, ignoring the lack of supporting infrastructure.
Therefore, these regulations are destined to fail. EPA's decision to
grant California's Clean Air Act waivers to enforce policies that are
unworkable for the trucking industry--policies developed via a process
that wholly discounted and marginalized trucking industry
participation--will result in unworkable regulations and undermine
long-term cooperative efforts to reduce emissions.
EPA's GHG 3 rule was an opportunity for the agency to reassert
their leadership in setting harmonized national emissions standards
that could provide certainty for the trucking industry. The final
regulation acknowledges today's challenges with ZEVs for model years
2027-2029. However, by 2030, EPA's targets will spike to unrealistic
levels.
Imposing unachievable state and federal mandates will reduce
investment in alternative low-carbon technologies like ultra-clean
renewable diesel (RD), renewable natural gas, and other low-carbon
fuels, moving us further away from our goal to reduce emissions in the
freight transportation sector. The new GHG 3 rule represents a missed
opportunity to course-correct unworkable, aggressive proposals laid out
by states like California that create a patchwork that complicates
interstate supply chains.
PITT OHIO and our peer companies would benefit more from a
technology- and fuel-neutral approach with timelines that allow for the
buildout of infrastructure to support these new vehicles and for the
technology market to mature so that fleets of all sizes can afford to
deploy these cleaner trucks.
Unfortunately, forced zero-emission vehicle penetration rates in
the later years of the GHG 3 rule as currently constructed fail to
offer flexibility and will limit fleets' choices with only early-stage
technologies that are still unproven.
The Cost of Unreasonable Timelines: Utilities, Vehicles, Technology
Maturity
The Biden Administration's multiagency U.S. National Blueprint for
Transportation Decarbonization recognized battery-electric technology
as having ``limited long-term potential'' in the long-haul segment.\14\
It pointed to better-positioned opportunities with hydrogen and
sustainable liquid fuels. These alternatives offer advantages in energy
density, comparable refueling times to diesel fuel, and compatibility
with many current internal combustion engine configurations, as seen
with biodiesel and renewable diesel. Despite the ambitious timelines
set by California to mandate battery-electric vehicle production and
fleet sales, the Administration's blueprint outlined longer, more
manageable timelines extending to 2050.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mandates that set the industry up for failure will not help to
accelerate the deployment of zero carbon fuel technologies nationwide.
Such standards, whether state-based or federal, distort the market for
vehicle manufacturers and complicate decisions for purchasers of new
heavy-duty trucks. Nearly half of the heavy-duty trucks on the road
today are model year 2010 and older diesel engines, meaning they lack
advanced emissions reducing technologies.\15\ Replacing those trucks
with current 2024 ultra-clean diesel trucks that are available on the
market today would deliver environmental emissions reductions
immediately. It could be done without subjecting fleets to the enormous
expense of ZEV technology vehicles that are not readily available, and
which lack the infrastructure to support their operations and
maintenance as part of regional and national interstate trucking
fleets.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\15\ Diesel Technology Forum, dieselforum.org
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
So far, battery-electric is not more efficient for my operation
than internal combustion. Currently, in just 15 minutes, a truck driver
can refuel a new clean-diesel truck for a journey of up to 1,200 miles.
Conversely, a two-hour charge can provide around 200 miles for battery-
electric trucks, though this range may significantly decrease due to
factors like cold weather, hilly terrain, or the use of HVAC systems.
In the regions we serve, adverse weather conditions and congestion have
the potential to further reduce this range. Even with adequate utility
service capacity and investment in chargers, achieving the same range
as a modern, clean-diesel truck in ideal conditions would still require
over five hours. While faster direct current (DC) chargers can cut that
recharging time in half, that equipment is expensive--roughly $100,000
each.
Battery-electric trucks also require significantly heavier
batteries (ranging from 6,000 to 17,000 lbs.), which results in lower
payload capacity than an internal combustion engine vehicle. This
reduced efficiency, combined with limited mileage range and charging
downtime, necessitates deploying more trucks and drivers to move the
same amount of freight. With the industry facing significant logistical
hurdles, battery-electric truck deployment could require a ratio of
three battery-electric trucks in some operations for every two diesel
trucks. An increase in the number of drivers needed to move the
nation's freight could exacerbate the ongoing nationwide driver
shortage, which currently stands at 78,000 drivers and which will
require the industry to hire over a million new drivers over the next
decade to meet demand. Hydrogen refueling infrastructure to support
hydrogen internal combustion engine (ICE) or hydrogen fuel cell trucks
is even more nascent, and those technologies raise similar weight- and
productivity-related concerns.
The transition to zero-emission trucks will require drivers and
mechanics to be retrained on the new equipment, which will drive
today's workforce investment costs higher. Additionally, while diesel
fueling stations can handle four to five trucks per hour, charging
stations would only accommodate two to three trucks per day. Each truck
parking spot (excluding fueling) would need a charging station,
exacerbating the shortage of truck parking capacity. Currently, there
is only one truck parking spot available for every 11 trucks on the
road.\16\ Combined with the related and complicated issues surrounding
hours of service, cargo securement, and cybersecurity, the industry
will need time to validate approaches and identify the most efficient
suite of fuels and technologies that perform according to our duty
cycle and keep in line with our commitment to decarbonization.

How Congress Can Help Today
Infrastructure can support the reduction of truck emissions in two
ways: eliminating bottlenecks so that the trucks currently on the road
can operate more efficiently, and building out the power generation,
transmission, and charging infrastructure necessary to support battery-
electric commercial trucks. As mentioned previously, electrification of
trucking is going to require enormous investments and attention to
areas that are not within the control of trucking. This transition will
require utility upgrades, power transmission improvements, construction
of additional space for truck parking, and modernization of our
nation's workforce development programs to bring in a new generation of
trucking workforce to drive and maintain these vehicles.
For today's environmental wellbeing, the greatest near-term
reduction in emissions can be accomplished by careful oversight and
distribution of Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) funding
to mitigate congestion and ensure the efficient movement of freight on
our nation's highways. Reducing idling hours and time wasted in stop-
and-go traffic on our nation's highway bottlenecks will make more
efficient use of every gallon of fuel burned, as well as benefit our
nation's truck drivers and highway safety. Congress should ensure that
highway funding is directed to new construction that targets those
chokepoints.\17\
Highway congestion adds nearly $75 billion to the cost of freight
transportation each year.\18\ In 2016, truck drivers sat in traffic for
nearly 1.2 billion hours, equivalent to more than 425,000 drivers
sitting idle for a year.\19\ This caused the trucking industry to
consume an additional 6.87 billion gallons of fuel in 2016,
representing approximately 13% of the industry's total fuel consumption
and resulting in 67.3 million metric tons of excess carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions.\20\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congestion serves as a brake on economic growth and job creation
nationwide, and I see every day the maintenance and operational
challenges that are created by stop-and-go traffic and the hazards of
roads and bridges in disrepair.
Repealing the current federal excise tax on heavy-duty trucks and
trailers would also make enormous strides in emissions reductions while
utilities and other stakeholders evolve to meet the demands of heavy-
duty trucking electrification. The current 12% tax is the highest
excise tax on any good and reduces our ability to invest in cleaner,
safer equipment. This tax adds roughly $25,000 to the cost of a new
clean-diesel tractor and can add $40,000 to $50,000 to the cost of a
battery-electric or alternative fuel truck. This limits me every year
when I am forced to buy twenty or twenty-one trucks instead of twenty-
five newer, cleaner tractors. Along with my entire industry, I support
and encourage the passage of H.R. 1440, the Modern, Clean and Safe
Trucks Act, to eliminate this World War I-era tax and spur further
investment in the trucks with the latest safety and emissions reduction
technologies.
New clean-diesel trucks can further reduce their environmental
footprint by burning sustainable fuels. However, while the Inflation
Reduction Act (IRA) increased the tax credit for Sustainable Aviation
Fuel (SAF) to a range of $1.25 to $1.75 per gallon, the credits for
renewable diesel remain at $1.00 per gallon. As a result, feedstocks
for this valuable emissions-reduction tool for trucking are likely to
be cannibalized for aviation. Restoring parity for tax credits for
renewable diesel--and increasing the tax credit for renewable natural
gas, which is used by some trucking companies and is currently eligible
for a $0.50 per gallon tax credit--can have immediate and sustainable
environmental benefits.
Moreover, incentivizing alternative fuels can potentially offer
significant, and potentially greater, benefits than electrification in
more difficult to decarbonize segments of the industry. A recent ATRI
report shows technologies like renewable diesel may yield larger
emissions-reduction benefits than battery electric technology.\21\
While BEV trucks offer a reduction of 30% in CO2 emissions compared to
ICE trucks using petroleum diesel, renewable diesel (RD) powered trucks
offer a more substantial reduction of 67.3%. This reduction includes
emissions throughout the vehicle and battery production, energy
consumption, and disposal phases.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\21\ ATRI, ``Renewable Diesel: A Catalyst for Decarbonization,''
April 2024.
\22\ RD derived from various feedstocks exhibits significantly
lower greenhouse gas intensity than petroleum diesel production.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further related to fuels, Congress and regulators also need to
understand that ongoing price volatility for diesel, and state-based
regulations increasing prices at the pump, continue to cost the
industry tens of billions of dollars and make it harder to upgrade
equipment to new, cleaner trucks. The trucking industry's fuel bill in
2019 was $112 billion when prices were $3.00/gallon. However, diesel
prices rose throughout 2022, reaching a high of $5.81/gallon--90%
higher than 2019 average prices. This increase resulted in an annual
diesel fuel bill exceeding $200 billion for the American trucking
industry, a nearly $100 billion yearly increase.
According to a 2022 ATRI survey of the industry, fuel costs (22%),
equipment and lease payments (15%), and repair and maintenance costs
(9%) account for 46%, or nearly half of the overall operating costs for
trucking companies nationwide. Surging fuel and truck prices, as well
as the deployment of new technologies that are difficult for fleets to
maintain, create enormous headwinds that stymie efforts to incentivize
fleets to invest in newer, cleaner equipment.
As a practitioner, I would also recommend that Congress and
agencies focus and prioritize distribution of funding through National
Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) grants, Charging and Fueling
Infrastructure (CFI) grants, Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles tax
credits, and Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property tax credits
for heavy-duty infrastructure projects to begin to provide momentum and
set stakes in the group for fleets. These programs can have long-term
impacts that will make it easier for PITT OHIO and our competitors to
invest in decarbonization without putting our businesses at risk. This
Committee in particular has a valuable role to play in overseeing
management and funds distribution by those programs, and the industry
is grateful to you for your leadership on that effort.
Finally, according to statistics from the U.S. Department of
Transportation, 95.7% of private and for-hire motor carriers operate 10
or fewer trucks and 99.7% operate fewer than 100 trucks. I urge the
Subcommittee to be aware of the challenges facing those small- and
medium-sized trucking fleets, in particular, because they are the heart
of our supply chains and face the biggest barriers to obtaining new,
clean trucks.
In Conclusion
Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today. I am
grateful for the opportunity to share my company's unique story and
encourage others to join in our dedicated movement towards
environmental sustainability.
On behalf of PITT OHIO, the American Trucking Associations, and the
8.4 million people in trucking-related jobs who power our nation's
supply chains and keep the wheels of the economy turning, we look
forward to working with the Subcommittee and Congressional leaders to
support legislation that will help us meet ambitious energy and
emissions goals. Thank you.

Mr. Crawford. Outstanding. Thank you.
Mr. Nigro, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF NICK NIGRO, FOUNDER, ATLAS PUBLIC POLICY

Mr. Nigro. Chair Crawford, Ranking Member Norton, and
members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to
speak today about the electrification of U.S. transportation.
My name is Nick Nigro, and I am the founder of Atlas Public
Policy, a policy and data research firm based here in
Washington, DC.
Atlas equips businesses and policymakers to make strategic,
informed decisions that serve the public interest. I appreciate
the opportunity to speak to you about the most important
transportation challenge we face this century.
In the last 15 years, our innovative businesses, with
support from Government and civil society, have made great
strides to transition the country off oil to a more
sustainable, secure, and economical fuel--electricity. Two
thousand twenty-three was a banner year for electric vehicles
with new U.S. sales exceeding $1.4 million. For comparison, it
took us nearly 8 years to reach the first million EV sales.
Passenger vehicles often steal the headlines, but truck and
bus electrification is also underway. The number of electric
trucks deployed nationwide jumped from only 1,200 in December
2021 to nearly 18,000 in June 2023, with trucks in every State.
Fast-charging stations necessary to make an EV as easy to own
as a gas vehicle are experiencing a similar surge. Twenty-five
percent of all operational fast-charging ports were installed
last year.
Make no mistake, this transition will take decades to
complete, but we have too much at stake to lose the future of
mobility to our competitors in China, in Europe, which made up
85 percent of global EV sales in 2023. The Alliance for
Automotive Innovation estimates that the automotive sector
supports nearly 10 million jobs in the United States. And the
International Energy Agency estimates that global EV sales
could reach 17 million in 2024, more than all passenger
vehicles Americans purchased last year.
The need to advance EVs goes well beyond our economic
interests. The American Lung Association estimates that zero-
emission trucks could lead to 65,000 fewer premature deaths by
2050. Moreover, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration estimates that climate-related disasters have
cost us nearly $2.7 trillion since 1980, with costs increasing
every decade.
Lastly, all the evidence I have analyzed has led me to the
conclusion that electrifying transportation is vital to our
national security, and it is impossible to put a pricetag on
that.
To complete the transition off oil, we must set up a policy
framework that puts us on a better footing globally. Since the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law in
November 2021, we have tracked $141 billion in announced
investments in EV manufacturing, with at least 80 percent of
these investments flowing to Republican congressional
districts. These investments will support 160,000 jobs,
including 59,000 jobs in disadvantaged communities. As the
clean economy ramps up, we are prioritizing those who have
historically been left behind.
Combined, the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure
Program and Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grants funded
through IIJA is the largest investment in charging in U.S.
history. These programs take a thoughtful complementary
approach to building out charging infrastructure, helping to
ensure all Americans can use their EV to go anywhere they want.
In addition, the power, port count, and reliability
requirements raise the bar for a nascent industry and provide
certainty on how companies will deliver a customer experience
akin to gasoline refueling. By the end of 2024, we expect NEVI-
funded stations will be open or under construction in most
States.
IIJA also supercharged the popular Low- or No-Emission
Program. Last year, $1.2 billion was awarded to projects in
nearly all States, with 70 percent of funds going to zero-
emission technology. The boost is timely as the seven largest
transit bus fleets, making up 60 percent of the market, will
purchase only zero-emission buses in the next 8 years.
Congress can use the surface transportation reauthorization
to redouble its efforts to support electric vehicles.
Specifically, Congress should renew the NEVI and CFI programs
and update requirements to meet the near-term needs of EV
drivers by doubling the poor power level per port and the
minimum number of ports per station.
Second, Congress should support truck electrification by
targeting charging along rights-of-way and at shared public
sites to support small businesses. Congress should update the
Low-No Program to focus funding on zero-emission technology as
it is the best option for the environment, human health, and
our economy.
Thank you for the opportunity to share my perspective
today. I look forward to your questions.
[Mr. Nigro's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Nick Nigro, Founder, Atlas Public Policy
Introduction
Chair Crawford, Ranking Member Norton, and members of the
committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak today about the
electrification of U.S. transportation. My name is Nick Nigro, and I am
the founder of Atlas Public Policy, a policy and data research firm
based right here in Washington, DC. Atlas equips businesses and
policymakers to make strategic, informed decisions that serve the
public interest. We build analytical tools and dashboards using
accessible technology and offer advisory services to tackle the
pressing issues of the day, with a particular focus on transportation
electrification.
I greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak to you about the most
important transportation challenge we face in this century. For more
than one hundred years, powering our transportation system has depended
largely on the extraction, refinement, and burning of petroleum-based
products to move goods and people throughout our road network.
In the last 15 years, our innovative businesses, with support from
all levels of government and civil society, have made great strides to
take on a once-in-a-century challenge to transition the country off oil
to a more sustainable, secure, and economical fuel, electricity.
Make no mistake. This transition will take decades to complete, but
we have too much at stake to sit on the sidelines and lose the future
of mobility to our competitors in China and Europe, which collectively
made up 85 percent of global EV sales in 2023 [1].
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation estimates that the
automotive sector supports nearly 10 million jobs and over $700 billion
in worker income every year in the United States [2]. Nearly 65 percent
of car and light truck sales in 2023 were from companies who have
committed to electrify all their vehicle offerings by 2035 or 2040. And
the International Energy Agency estimates that global EV sales could
reach 17 million in 2024 [1], more than all passenger vehicles
purchased in the United States last year.
Passenger vehicles often steal the headlines, but truck and bus
electrification are well underway as well. By 2040, the three truck
manufacturers that make up 70 percent of the medium and heavy-duty
market--Daimler Truck, Volvo Group, and Navistar--aim to sell only zero
emission vehicles. These manufacturers, along with large national
fleets, logistics companies, charging infrastructure developers, and
electric utilities, formed PACT, a comprehensive coalition focused on
one of the most critical barriers to accelerating the uptake of zero
emission commercial vehicles: the deployment of medium- and heavy-duty
truck zero emission charging and refueling infrastructure [3].
We aren't just racing against foreign nations to lead the
development of 21st century vehicle technology. We're also in a race to
mitigate the worst effects of climate change on the planet and tailpipe
pollution on human health. The American Lung Association estimates that
transitioning trucks to zero emission could lead to $735 billion in
public health benefits and more than 65,000 fewer premature deaths by
2050 [4]. Moreover, unmitigated climate change is a looming threat to
the global economy. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
estimates that climate-related disasters have cost us nearly $2.7
trillion since 1980, with costs significantly increasing with each
decade [5].
Finally, in terms of the drivers to an electric future, I'd be
remiss if I didn't bring up the major factor that brought me to
Washington nearly 15 years ago. You see, I studied electrical and
computer engineering in the late 90s and took a job in the booming
high-tech sector in Massachusetts in 2001. Applying my engineering
education and building popular consumer products was a rewarding
experience. But while I was sitting pretty in Boston, the country was
in a deepening national security crisis, which I believe was driven in
part by our dependence on oil. I was motivated to change the direction
of my career, and my life, by going back to school, learning energy
policy, and putting my engineering brain to better use. All of the
evidence I've analyzed over the past 15 years has led me to the clear
conclusion that electrifying our transportation sector is vital to our
national security, and it's near impossible to put a price tag on that.
State of Play
As I've summarized here with you today: the days of the combustion
engine are numbered. We must finish the job by setting up a policy
framework that puts the United States on a better footing globally and
helps us regain a leadership position in this vital industry.
The good news is that in the last three years, investments have
flooded into all parts of the country, in large part thanks to the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation
Reduction Act (IRA). Since IIJA was signed into law in November 2021,
investments in EV manufacturing facilities totaling about $141 billion
have been announced [6]. Notably, at least 80 percent of these
investments are flowing to Congressional districts represented by
Republicans. These investments are expected to support more than
160,000 jobs in manufacturing operations and cover activity across the
EV supply chain, from minerals processing to produce precursor
materials for battery production, all the way to EV production and end-
of-life battery recycling to recover materials for reuse. To date,
Georgia, North Carolina, and Michigan lead the country in announced
investments, accounting for nearly $58 billion combined.
Where these investments and jobs are sited, and who they are
impacting, are also important factors in the EV transition. Twenty
thousand announced manufacturing jobs will be in Energy Communities,
defined by the federal government as places with former fossil fuel
industrial sites, including power plants, mines, and oil and gas wells
[6]. Additionally, more than 59,000 jobs announced will be located in
disadvantaged communities. As the clean economy ramps up, communities
that have historically been left behind are finally being prioritized.
The investments announced boast big numbers, but they go well
beyond press releases. In fact, 66 percent of investments are at
facilities currently in operation or under construction. At least 90
facilities are on track to go into operation by 2024 or 2025,
representing 80,000 manufacturing jobs.
In the passenger vehicle market, 2023 was a banner year for
electric vehicles. More than 1.4 million new EVs were registered last
year. For comparison, it took the country nearly eight years to reach
the first million EV sales [7]. Fast charging stations, a critical part
of making an EV as easy to own as a gas vehicle, are experiencing a
similar surge in popularity. More than 25 percent of all fast-charging
ports currently operational were installed in 2023, reaching a rate of
250 per week in the fourth quarter [8].
It's not all smooth sailing though and we should expect the market
to ebb and flow as the technology progresses, consumer interest
evolves, and new and entrenched businesses are challenged. To
illustrate, new EV sales for the three months from December 2023 to
February 2024 are up 20 percent over the previous year's figures;
however, these figures are down from the 50 percent growth we saw in
all of 2023 [9]. This is not evidence that the EV market is struggling
per se, but it does reveal that vehicle offerings must meet consumer
expectations and that automakers must continue to innovate to drive
interest.
Economists describe ``creative destruction'' as the process where
innovation delivers progress and new products make the existing ones
obsolete. There are countless examples of this in consumer electronics,
whereas until recently the vehicle market has experienced gradual
progress over many decades. EVs are the first major disruption to how
vehicles are built and powered in more than a century, and there will
be winners and losers. I'm confident in American know-how and
ingenuity, but we need to keep our eyes on the ball and manage our
resources.
Charging Infrastructure
For many Americans, charging an EV can be as easy as plugging in
your cell phone every night. More than 65 percent of Americans live in
single family homes, many of which have garages and easy access to
power [10]. Electric utilities across the country have deployed
charging programs to support consumers and encourage them to charge at
times of day that are good for the electrical grid and their wallets.
The convenience of charging at home and cost effectiveness of doing so,
thanks in part to utilities, helps explain why most experts expect EV
drivers to only rely on public charging for a small fraction of their
trips, particularly as EV ranges continue to climb.
While most EV drivers won't use the infrastructure very often, they
consistently cite a lack of reliable public charging as a primary
barrier to EV adoption [11]. The lack of near-term demand for public
charging services combined with the expectation of its widespread,
reliable access make the charging business model challenging. The
federal government has historically played a constructive role in
addressing market transition opportunities like this and EVs are no
different.
Combined, the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI)
program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grants (CFI) funded
through IIJA is the single largest investment in charging in U.S.
history. These programs take a thoughtful, complementary approach to
building out the nation's charging infrastructure, helping to ensure
Americans can use their EV to go anywhere they want. Over the last two
years, state departments of transportation (DOT) across the country
have created strategic plans, built capacity, introduced themselves to
their local utilities in some cases, and stood up this brand-new
program that is quickly becoming an integral part of the DOT's
operations. As of late April 2024, six states have stations open to the
public, one state's first station is under construction, 13 states have
issued awards, and 15 states are currently issuing or evaluating
proposals. By the end of 2024, we can expect NEVI-funded stations to be
open or under construction in most states.
State DOTs are largely engineering-focused institutions, and as an
engineer, I can tell you that we like to plan and make sure we get
everything right before committing major resources to a project. The
first 12-18 months of NEVI were just that; many state DOTs had never
funded an EV charging project and had to hire new staff or bring in
outside help. All of this takes time, but these planning and capacity
building activities are critically important to ensure the goals of
NEVI are realized and that these and future funds are used in a way
that is transparent, efficient, and equitable.
NEVI is doing more than building out fast charging along the
Interstate Highway System. The requirements related to power, charger
count, and reliability are transformational for the industry. At each
NEVI-funded station, EV drivers can expect at least four ports, each
delivering 150 kilowatts of power, that are available and operational
nearly all of the time [12].\1\ These requirements raise the bar for a
nascent industry and provide much-needed certainty on where companies
must go to deliver a customer experience akin to gasoline refueling.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ NEVI requires an average annual uptime of 97 percent or greater
for each port.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While it's best for the grid and household budgets for EV drivers
to charge overnight where they park, many households do not have this
opportunity today. Millions of families rent, live in large apartment
buildings, park on public streets, or otherwise don't have the ability
to deliver power to where they park. A lack of public, fast charging
can make it hard for those drivers to consider an EV. Here, NEVI and
CFI are filling another important charging access gap.
Charging infrastructure will continue to be a challenge for the EV
industry in the near term as more everyday Americans buy EVs. The bar
for the charging experience will rise because these drivers will not be
as forgiving as early adopters have been with regards to technical
glitches or other unexpected issues. The good news is that programs
like NEVI, CFI, and many state and electric utility programs
nationwide, are fostering a vibrant private charging market. Future
programs focused on fast charging should continue to raise the bar
through higher power requirements and offering more ports per station.
Electrifying Commercial Trucks
Like passenger vehicles, the zero-emission commercial truck market
in the United States is experiencing significant growth and
transformation, driven by increasing demand for sustainable
transportation solutions and the need to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions in the logistics sector. As the market evolves, we must
understand the status quo, key drivers, challenges, and the role of the
federal government in supporting the accelerated deployment of zero-
emission trucks.
Currently, as more models become available the zero-emission truck
market is seeing a surge in sales. As of December 2021, only 1,215
zero-emission trucks had been deployed in the United States, but by
June 2023 that number had climbed to over 17,500, including deployments
in every state [13, 14].
Manufacturers are introducing a variety of battery-electric and
hydrogen fuel cell trucks to cater to different applications, from
last-mile delivery to long-haul transportation. For example, some urban
delivery trucking fleets are already saving money by deploying zero-
emission vehicles [15]. Health and climate benefits aside, the lower
operating costs, reduced maintenance requirements, and improved driver
experience have made zero-emission trucks an attractive option for
last-mile delivery operations.
In new markets like this, incentive funding at the state and,
particularly, the federal levels play a crucial role in offsetting the
higher upfront costs and encouraging fleet adoption. Additionally,
numerous demonstration programs across the country, such as the North
American Council for Freight Efficiency's Run on Less Electric events,
have showcased the real-world performance and benefits of zero-emission
trucks [16]. These programs provide valuable insights into the
operational capabilities and cost savings potential of zero-emission
technologies. Furthermore, the increasing demand from shippers and
logistics companies to reduce emissions across their supply chains has
created a strong market pull for zero-emission trucks.
Despite this progress, the zero-emission truck market still faces
several barriers to widespread adoption. One primary challenge is the
lack of truck-specific recharging and refueling infrastructure, such as
pull-through spots designed to accommodate larger vehicles. The absence
of a comprehensive network of charging stations and hydrogen fueling
facilities has hindered the deployment of zero-emission trucks,
particularly for long-haul operations.
Moreover, the economics of zero-emission trucks remain challenging
due to the higher upfront costs of vehicles and the need for
significant, expensive investments in charging infrastructure.
User acceptance is another barrier, as the trucking industry is
known for its risk-averse approach to adopting new technologies.
Specifically, there is a misconception that zero-emission technologies
are unproven in terms of durability and reliability, which has slowed
down their adoption. Lastly, the lack of parking facilities for
commercial trucks, especially tractor-trailers, presents an opportunity
to address both the infrastructure and parking challenges
simultaneously [17]. As a result, investing in the development of truck
parking facilities equipped with chargers and amenities, such as
showers and convenience stores, can support the deployment of zero-
emission trucks while improving driver comfort and safety.
The federal government plays a vital role in supporting the
accelerated development and deployment of zero-emission trucks through
several programs, such as those in IIJA and IRA. To ensure that we
remain competitive in the global zero-emission truck landscape, we must
focus on domestic manufacturing and supply chain development for both
vehicles and infrastructure.
The federal government can continue to provide incentives, grants,
and low-interest loans to encourage investments in zero-emission truck
manufacturing and the establishment of a robust charging and refueling
infrastructure network. Additionally, the government can support
research and development efforts to improve battery and fuel cell
technologies, enhance vehicle efficiency, and reduce costs. Programs
like NEVI, CFI, and Rebuilding American Infrastructure with
Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grants help take equipment from the
laboratory to the field and are essential to fostering a nascent market
like electric trucks. Collaboration between the public and private
sectors, along with targeted investments in workforce training and
education, can help build a strong ecosystem for zero-emission trucks
in the United States, such as in state-sponsored workforce development
programs and the U.S. Department of Energy's Electric Drive Vehicle
Battery Recycling and 2nd Life Apps Program.
As the zero-emission commercial truck market grows and evolves, we
must address these barriers and leverage opportunities to accelerate
the transition towards sustainable transportation. By implementing
market-based policies, investing in infrastructure, and fostering
domestic manufacturing capabilities, the United States can position
itself as a leader in the zero-emission truck industry while creating
jobs, reducing emissions, and driving innovation in the logistics
sector.
Transit Bus Electrification
Zero-emission transit buses have been deployed across cities and
municipal regions throughout the United States to abate air pollution
and greenhouse gas emissions in hard to decarbonize urban areas. A
recent study by CALSTART found that the United States has 5,775 battery
electric transit buses on the road as of September 2023, an increase of
12 percent since 2022 [18]. More than half of these buses are operating
in California (1,760), New York (737), and Florida (464). While the
growth rate nationwide slowed compared to 2022, seven states (Illinois,
Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, and Oregon)
saw their zero-emission bus deployment rise by at least 50 percent.
This marked growth in regions nationwide is expected to accelerate
in the near term largely thanks to funding from IIJA. The law
supercharged the popular Low and No Emission (Low-No) Program run by
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) with $5.25 billion in funding
over five years [19]. Last year, more than $1.2 billion was awarded to
130 projects in 46 states. To put this in perspective, the Low-No
funding awarded in the first two years of IIJA was 3.5 times the total
amount awarded in the history of the program. Nearly 70 percent of that
funding has gone to zero emission technology, and those buses will make
a meaningful difference in the health and well-being of the transit
workers who will operate them [8].
The transition to zero emission buses will take time. The
technology available today, while steadily improving, may not yet meet
every use case. For example, cold weather range loss is particularly
challenging for regions with harsh winter seasons, and these losses are
exacerbated at slower speeds. At 60 miles per hour or greater, on the
other hand, recent analyses reveal that temperature has little or no
effect [20]. Thus, transit agencies must account for this expected
range loss in their route and charging planning. Technological
solutions and operational strategies can be used to minimize these
impacts, such as pre-heating the interior and battery, installing more
efficient heating technology in buses, and creating strategic planning
and adaptation guidelines for transportation authorities.
The funding boost from IIJA is coming at the best time as transit
agencies nationwide are lining up to commit to a zero emission future.
The nation's seven largest transit bus fleets, spanning from Los
Angeles to Boston to right here in Washington, DC, make up more than 60
percent of our total transit bus fleet [21]. Each one of these agencies
intends to purchase only zero emission buses in the next eight
years.\2\ It's an ambitious and laudable goal, and they will need
continued help from Congress and state governments to deliver on these
promises.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Individual transit agency websites spell out agency goals or
state requirements to transition to zero emission vehicles for all new
purchases within the next 10 years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Looking Ahead
Electrifying the transportation sector is an opportunity we cannot
miss--too much is at stake. The health of Americans, our economy, and
our planet demand we decarbonize vehicles as quickly as possible. And
effective public policy, at all levels of government, is crucial to
decarbonize.
We're in the middle of a global economic competition for the future
of vehicle manufacturing. At the moment, the United States is playing
catchup to China and Europe but there is still time for us to regain a
leadership position, and we must, in order to continue supporting
millions of U.S. jobs and an industry vital to our economy.
Congress's leadership through the IIJA and IRA has generated a wave
of positive momentum in the United States. We are seeing billions in
new investments in manufacturing, thousands of new, good paying jobs,
and the deployment of advanced vehicle and charging technology
nationwide.
Surface transportation reauthorization is a rare opportunity for
Congress to redouble its efforts to support electrifying U.S.
transportation through continued and expanded funding for charging
infrastructure and vehicle deployment. Specifically, Congress should
renew the NEVI and CFI programs. Updating NEVI's requirements to meet
the needs of current and future EV drivers is a crucial accessibility
consideration, and can be done by increasing charger power levels to
350 kilowatts per port and doubling the minimum number of ports from
four to eight per station. Second, Congress should support the
burgeoning truck electrification market by targeting charging
deployment along rights of way and at shared public sites to support
small businesses who may not have ready access to a depot. Lastly,
Congress should consider updating the Low-No Program to focus funding
on zero emission technology, since electrified transportation is the
best option for the environment, human health, and our economy.

Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Nigro.
I thank all of you for your testimony. We will now turn to
questions from the panel. I recognize myself for 5 minutes for
questions.
Let me start with Mr. Darakos. I appreciate you raising a
number of the challenges that trucking fleets, both large and
small, face as they consider how to respond to decarbonization
policies without bankrupting their businesses. You also shared
with the subcommittee the significant multiyear investments
that the trucking sector has already made to reduce its
environmental footprint.
Talk about more of the challenges associated with only
running Class 7 or Class 8 battery-electric trucks and why PITT
OHIO has chosen to have a fleet with different fuel options.
Mr. Darakos. Sure. Thank you, Chairman.
In terms of hurdles, I would say there are three buckets to
consider. It is technology, infrastructure, and cost. So, from
our experiences, the technology was not readily available until
2 years ago for initial demonstration projects. In fact, we
were one of the early fleets to bring battery-electric medium-
duty trucks into our operation. The range, the payloads,
significantly less than the current conventional trucks that
are on the road today.
So, when you think about what that does to our operation,
it changes the dynamics of what we do and how we do it.
Infrastructure: significant hurdles. So, we have 25 depots.
We have considered electrification in 12 of those depots. Ten
different utilities that we have to work with. I can share
stories with you that, you know, we did a lot of work on the
facility side many years ago, Chairman. We electrified our
forklift fleet. Today, we are 42 percent electrified. The
reason we are not 100 percent: We do not have the power to
support electrification in those facilities. So, those are
small loads.
As we talk about medium-duty, heavy-duty, it is a very
large load that we are bringing to the grid. And those projects
to electrify our depots are taking a long time. We have an
electrification project today that will have taken 2 years from
start to finish to get 3 megawatts of power onsite, and that is
just for a small project. And we are ahead of the curve.
And then lastly I would say is cost. So, what we have seen
pre-incentives, 3\1/2\ to 4 times the cost of the conventional
vehicle, we have seen significant cost increases over the last
years, 2 years for conventional vehicles. And I just signed an
order agreement for three trucks. One and a half million
dollars is the equivalent of 10\1/2\ vehicles in internal
combustion engine technology.
So, as I mentioned right now, our hurdles are centered
around technology, and the technology is improving. It is the
infrastructure which is a large challenge, and it is the cost
of the technology moving forward.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you. In your testimony, you highlighted
the Roland Berger study that I mentioned in my opening
comments. Can you give us a little bit more about the real-
world electrification challenges raised by that study? And I
guess I would like to know how difficult it would be for the
trucking sector to meet both the Biden administration's carbon
reduction goals in addition to what California wants to
require.
Mr. Darakos. There are a lot of folks working really hard
to move this forward. In terms of that study, a lot of the
charging that has to happen for our fleet has to be behind-the-
fence charging. So, that is a significant investment of
resources. And we are a large organization. We are family-
owned. But the majority of trucking companies today are small
businesses. And the reality is, they do not have the
infrastructure, the teams to kind of move this forward.
In our experiences over the last 3 years, it has taken a
team to move these small projects forward. So, that is one
aspect of it.
The other piece is from a duty-cycle standpoint in the
Roland Berger study, there is a lot of investment that is going
to have to happen in corridor charging. That is fine, but it is
going to have a significant impact in terms of how we do
business today.
During the day, our fleet does city deliveries. At night,
they do line haul deliveries which are terminal to terminal. We
average 520 miles a night. We have drivers that operate over
600 miles a night. That is not possible if we have to stop and
recharge for 30 minutes to an hour. So, there are some
significant hurdles.
I think the study out does a good job of shining the
spotlight on the significant investment that is going to have
to happen, but there are some challenges that I see with that
study as how we move forward.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you.
Mr. Coggin, real quick, you mentioned the inclement weather
down the coast that you deal with. I am curious how that
inclement weather would impact your ability to function if you
were all electric, given the Katrina scenario, for example. Can
you talk about that?
Mr. Coggin. Yes, sir. Hurricane Katrina was a Cat 5
devastating hurricane who pretty much destroyed our entire
community. Our public transit agency is a very important part
of evacuation and recovery. During these events, we are part of
the Harrison County Emergency Management Agency. We are totally
responsible for Emergency Support Function 1--Transportation.
So, we are called upon to meet all of the needs of the
community when these events happen. And so, we provide
evacuation transportation. That is the easy part.
After the storm, if it is devastating, people lose their
homes, their cars, power--it could be out for weeks at a time,
like Hurricane Katrina. If we were 100 percent electric, we
would not be able to support the community in that type of a
power outage. So, that is a critical issue for us being able to
meet those needs.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you. My time has expired.
Ranking Member Holmes Norton.
Ms. Norton. Mr. Nigro, we have heard some discussion today
about the cost of transitioning to cleaner vehicles. Congress
has a role to play in alleviating those costs. But we would be
remiss not to also speak about the significant benefits of a
cleaner transportation system.
What are the benefits of electrification both in terms of
human health and avoiding environmental catastrophe?
Mr. Nigro. Thank you for the question.
So, let me start with the tailpipe. With no tailpipe, we
see huge local air emission benefits immediately in all the
areas where an EV operates. I mentioned earlier that the
American Lung Association estimates that zero-emission trucks
could lead to 65,000 fewer premature deaths by 2050. It
performed a similar study for passenger vehicles, and they
found that that combined with reducing emissions from the
electricity sector where the power comes from could lead to
89,300 fewer premature deaths by 2050. So, that is a lot of
human health benefits.
A new analysis from Bloomberg found that EVs produce about
70 percent less carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in gasoline
vehicles over their lifetime. It is important to highlight the
lifetime aspect of this because we have been actively
decarbonizing the electrical grid for some time. There is an
old adage in the EV space: The dirtiest days of your EV is the
first day you take it off the lot. Because the grid is
continually getting cleaner.
You also asked about the benefits of avoiding environmental
disasters. I highlighted what NOAA does, and, frankly, at
Atlas, we are quite jealous of their work in tracking climate-
related disasters because it is all about making that data
publicly accessible. They estimated that it cost us nearly $2.7
trillion in climate-related disasters from all kinds of events
since 1980.
Those costs, importantly, are increasing each decade. So,
the problem is getting worse. And so, the sooner we act, the
fewer costs we will have to endure in the long term.
Ms. Norton. Well, Mr. Nigro, Federal electric vehicle
charging programs have taken time to implement, as the Biden
administration first had to follow congressional directives to
create a new joint office and issue technical standards to
ensure consistent charging experience nationwide. The
administration also chose to issue a stronger Buy America
standard for electric vehicle chargers. I believe the
administration did the right thing.
Were those steps worth the extra time it took to get these
programs implemented, Mr. Nigro?
Mr. Nigro. So, that is a great question because for folks
who don't work closely with State DOTs, from the outside
looking in, the law was enacted. And for some time, not much
money has been spent installing charging, at least from the
outside looking in.
But as an engineer--similar to Ms. Okafor, I am also an
electrical engineer--State DOTs are engineering-focused
organizations. And what they want to do and what we like to do
as engineers is plan and make sure that we get everything right
before we commit resources. And the reality of NEVI, in
particular, the first 12 to 18 months was just doing that,
building up capacity within the States' DOTs to hire people.
Many DOTs had never done any recharging program before. So,
they had to either bring in outside help or hire new resources,
and they had to submit plans for how they were going to
implement their program. So, all of that takes time. But it's
important because it's building long-term capacity within the
DOTs.
And what has become evident, watching, again, from the
outside on what is happening within DOTs, it is quickly
becoming a core part of what they do as a department of
transportation, not just building roads and bridges, but also
making sure that mobility as a service is provided. And EV
charging is an increasingly important part of that.
And so, in essence, these plans are essential because we
want to make sure that the money that gets spent here from IIJA
is transparent, it is sufficient, and it is equitable. And that
is going to take time. And that is something that we have had
to accept in the recent past.
On the other hand, I mentioned earlier, the funding is
starting to go out the door. And so, by the end of this year,
we expect that there are actually going to be stations open or
under construction in most States. And now that the DOTs have--
many of them have issued awards, I expect that we are going to
see a lot more NEVI stations open up in the near term because
these sites are actually relatively quick construction sites.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Nigro. My time has expired.
Mr. Crawford. I thank the gentlelady.
Mr. Webster.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Ms. Okafor, this is a pretty simple question. Where does
the electricity come from that charges these batteries?
Mrs. Okafor. Thank you for the question.
There are a number of different ways that electricity is
produced throughout the country. There are a number of
production plants. And then the utility agencies throughout the
country transmit that power out to the demand locations, which
are EV charging stations.
Mr. Webster of Florida. So, the Biden administration wants
to have half a million stations opened up. There have only been
eight built so far. So, pretty much they still want half a
million. So, do you know if there is enough power somewhere out
there being generated right now to support those 500 stations?
Mrs. Okafor. It is an extremely important question. The
utilities throughout our country have a very significant job on
their hands to make sure that there is enough power that gets
transmitted to these EV charging stations. Quite honestly, they
are our partner as we think about the value chain, to working
together with the utility to help them understand when we are
going to put in chargers and how much load we require, so that
they can build the utility power production plant as quickly
and as effectively as possible. It is a better question for a
utility agency, but it will be a significant challenge
throughout the country.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Yes, because permitting is not the
easiest thing in the world to do. And depending on what kind of
powerplant you are permitting, for a nuclear plant, probably
not going to happen in our lifetime. So, I just wondered--if
that be the case, how much for an average battery-powered
vehicle that runs--before the battery is run down, how much
does it take in power to recharge those batteries?
Mrs. Okafor. Different OEMs have different battery packs in
their systems. At our locations, we have seen that customers
usually stay in charge at a fast charger between 20 and 40
minutes, and they take somewhere between 30 and 40
kilowatthours per charge.
Mr. Webster of Florida. OK. So, if all 500,000 of those are
operating at one time, that is a lot of juice.
Mrs. Okafor. It is certainly a significant amount of power,
more power than we use right now. You are correct.
Mr. Webster of Florida. So, how much does it--what would be
the timeframe to permit and build an electric station? What
does it take to do that?
Mrs. Okafor. For an EV charging station? The typical build
time for an EV charging station altogether is 12 to 18 months.
I would say the three long lead items in that schedule is, one,
the procurement and manufacturing of the charger. Two, it is
the utility upgrade. That by far is the portion of the schedule
that's the hardest to predict. We don't get that much
information from the utility early on. And then third is
exactly what you are saying, permitting. Because we have no
control on how long the AHJ takes to permit our stations, we
are dependent on the AHJ to review it in a timely fashion and
to get the permit out to us. On average, we see permitting
taking anywhere between 1 and 3 to 4 months max.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Do you have to get a permit if you
are just adding on EV power?
Mrs. Okafor. You do, yes. So, at a location like Love's
that is already a fueling station, you do have to get an
additional permit to add chargers to our stations.
Mr. Webster of Florida. So, would that be the same as if it
were new? New or add-on, it would be the same amount of time,
you think?
Mrs. Okafor. Say that one more time. Would you repeat the
question for me, please?
Mr. Webster of Florida. OK. So, you said that they have
add-ons on stations that already exist, and then there are new
stations that exist. Does it take the same amount of time to do
either one, as far as electric power? I am not talking about
the whole station.
Mrs. Okafor. For just the charge, it depends on what it is
that you are building. But if you are--let's say you are
building a new truckstop. Permitting the truckstop itself takes
a significant amount of time. So, it does fall within--
permitting the truckstop--permitting that EV charging station
falls within the timeframe of permitting the truckstop.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Is that two permits? Or do you just
permit the whole station, and it could be or may not be an EV
station?
Mrs. Okafor. For an EV charging station, you typically need
a build permit and, I believe, a structural permit.
I wish I had my design-build manager up here with me. He
would be able to answer that question much easier than I would.
But there are different sorts of permits that you need. For
a truckstop, obviously, you would need much more than that.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you.
OK. Yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Larsen.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Those are great questions outlining that most of these--
there is a bucket of challenges that have nothing to do with
the Federal Government and a lot to do with everybody else.
And one of the main issues--and I want to come back to you;
I have a question for Mr. Nigro, but I want to come back to
you--one of the main issues is you are dealing with local
utilities that, basically, even though they wield the power or
send the power, they own it. They own your access to it. So, it
doesn't matter if you are building a charging station, a
commercial facility, industrial facility, the utility is the
gatekeeper on your power.
Mr. Nigro, I made the point, the chair made the point, the
NEVI program has only funded 8 charging stations, soon to be
20, with the 12 that will be located immediately, and a total
of 78 at the Library Commons project in Mount Vernon. But,
still, it is a challenge, and it is not a great story.
Can you talk a little bit about how we can accelerate the
Federal funding to get chargers funded?
Mr. Nigro. So, when it comes to NEVI, there was just a
significant amount of time required to stand up the program. I
am actually quite confident that DOTs are going to be issuing
funding opportunities in rapid succession. Many are actually
already on their second round of funding.
And so, as I mentioned earlier, I think before the end of
the year, I would expect more than half of the States to have
either sites under construction or open at this point.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes. But, to date, even though
the number is eight, do you have an estimate of the number of
chargers that are actually deployed, total, regardless of who
has funded them?
Mr. Nigro. Oh, you mean in addition to NEVI? How many----
Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. Eight, plus how
many? Yes, right.
Mr. Nigro. No, I don't have that number with me, but I
can----
Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. Is it 100? Is it
200? Is it 1,000?
Mr. Nigro. Fast chargers available to any American right
now in the public, it's somewhere near 10,000.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Somewhere near 10,000.
Mr. Nigro. Yes.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. All right. Great. Thanks. Thanks.
So, back to Ms. Okafor, you mentioned some of the
challenges. Are there things that we can do to clear the brush
on these challenges?
Mrs. Okafor. Yes. What it really reminds me of is the
biodiesel incentive structure. So, Love's is one of the leading
blenders of biodiesel throughout the country, and the incentive
structure that biodiesel had was a two-sided structure: One,
you had incentives for infrastructure; on the other side, you
had incentives for the energy or the fuel to go to the
consumer.
On the EV charging side for NEVI, we have incentivized the
infrastructure and haven't incentivized demand to get the
consumer to be incentivized to buy these electric vehicles. So,
increasing the demand for the charging stations would make the
economics for the infrastructure much easier to bear. So, the
help that we would be looking for is on incentives on
incentivizing drivers to buy these EVs.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes. Thanks.
And then, Mr. Coggin, Todd Morrow was here a few weeks
ago--he is at Island Transit in my district--speaking on behalf
of the CTAA, testifying on a separate set of issues. But they
are also going to electric and propane, because they are a
rural transit agency as well, and so, they are going to do a
fuel mix as well.
We have seen quite a number of, at least in Washington
State, and I am sure around the country, both urban, suburban,
and rural transit agencies adopting low- and no-emission and
working through that transition, as well, with their own sets
of challenges.
So, when you are done, if you will, with your transition,
what will be your fleet mix in terms of fuel?
Mr. Coggin. Based on current technology and budgetary
constraints, we are using propane for small and midsize
vehicles, and we are using pure electric on the big buses.
The mix of our fleet, 54 vehicles, is currently 20 percent
gasoline, 52 percent diesel, 27 percent propane, and only 1
percent electric. We only have one 35-foot heavy-duty bus. We
have 12 buses on order now that are going to be propane to
replace diesel, so, we are going to go from 27 percent to 39
percent propane by the end of the summer this year.
Going forward, we don't know what that is going to look
like. We are looking at pure electric. Pure electric is more
expensive than the other technologies. There are costs to that.
And we also are blessed to live in a community with clean air.
We are not in a nonattainment area.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Right.
Mr. Coggin. But we--I personally think that federally
funded public agencies should be taking the lead in alternative
fuels. And there are a bunch of alternatives other than
electric out there. If you have really bad air-quality issues,
certainly electric is the way to go, but we don't.
So, our current strategy is, as I said, using propane. It
is cleaner than diesel, less expensive to operate, and cheaper
than electric. But electric is totally clean. So, it just
depends on your weather, geography, operating requirements.
So, going forward, 20 years from now, who knows what the
technology and the costs are going to be? And if we wind up
having air-quality issues, it will certainly be electric for
us. But right now the plan is not for pure electric.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. That is great. That is helpful.
And appreciate it, Mr. Chair. And I will follow up with Mr.
Darakos on some questions on trucking, but--if I had time to
yield back, I would do it.
Mr. Crawford. All right.
The gentleman yields.
Mr. Bost.
Mr. Bost. Mr. Darakos, when I look over the panel, I am
trying to figure out which person I could ask this of.
I was born and raised in a trucking business; actually
dealt with a whole lot of hazardous material, including the
ANFO for mines, gas, diesel, propane.
When you start working with electric vehicles, what is the
higher danger of when you start moving hazardous material, when
we are talking about charging stations, and the intersection of
all of those? Do you know?
Mr. Darakos. Yes, I can comment on that.
From our standpoint, we move a lot of hazardous-material
products through our LTL network. We also do flammables,
explosives. So, there is a concern. In fact, the way we are
structuring charging today, we do it away from our dock
facility because of the risk and the potential hazards with
thermal runaway on those electric vehicles.
So, we could reduce the impact of infrastructure stress on
our facilities if we had confidence to plug those vehicles in
at the dock as the units were being loaded, but today the
charging happens away from the dock.
In fact, recently, there was a fire in Columbus, Ohio,
where a partner LTL carrier had lithium batteries that were
coming back, that were being sent back in, defective, and they
had a thermal runaway that shut down a 1-mile radius in the
Columbus area and shut down the terminal operations.
So, it's real. We are considering it and looking at it. And
I think that is why we are walking into this slowly as the
technology evolves.
Mr. Bost. I think there are some concerns that many of us
have. You know what? We would all like to have clean vehicles.
We would all like to have the--where it's perfect. But what we
don't say about the electric vehicle is the ability to create a
grid powerful enough to handle that.
I worked for 20 years in the State legislature on the
public utilities. And our base load would not handle increasing
to the point of what we are talking about through this
administration.
But, with that, Ms. Okafor, I know that Love's offers EV
charging, hydrogen, compressed natural gas, renewable natural
gas, biodiesel, to name just a few. You do provide all of it.
Now, in your opinion, if this administration focuses on
electric, it's limiting investments in other types of
alternative fuels.
Now, another problem that is out there is, China currently
controls the EV charging market and a majority of the
refineries for the critical minerals that are used to
manufacture batteries.
Are there any alternative fuels that you deal with that you
believe that we, as the U.S., can become energy-independent
with and actually keep ourselves away from the big fear that we
have of China?
Mrs. Okafor. Thank you for the question. It is a great
question.
When I think about the incentive programs that we have in
place today and, in some cases, mandates that we have in place,
it strikes me that we may be doing this in the reverse order.
Some of the challenges that you have mentioned are things that
I believe that we should be focusing on: what are the solutions
to those challenges.
So, as we move forward in determining what the energy
transition should be in our country, focusing on solutions to
challenges is what I think that we should be doing.
Mr. Bost. Yes.
And the only thing that I would also close out here--I
don't want to drag on too long, but--the frustration that we
feel.
This Nation has been really, really, really good on
allowing the free market to work. And I am going to tell you
something: that whenever the internal combustion engine was
created in this Nation, guess what? Government didn't have to
go out and set up gas stations. Who did it? We, the free
people. What we did was, we had entrepreneurs that saw a golden
opportunity.
If electric vehicles come to a point where all of a sudden
you, yourself, along with your companies and everything like
that, have put in--if you can use the electric vehicles. But
taking existing taxpayer dollars to build an infrastructure
that it's not time for yet seems a little confusing to most of
the people out here.
Because, right now, we can't charge to the level we are
talking about, as good as it may sound. And it is wonderful to
quote statistics, as long as you are quoting your statistics
that support you. And I think on this issue maybe we ought to
wisen up and let the free-market system work.
And, with that, I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Ms. Brownley.
Ms. Brownley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Throughout our Nation's history, we have been at the
forefront of transportation and transportation innovation.
When the first locomotive steam engine was developed, we
innovated and adapted and built a coast-to-coast, nationwide
network of interconnected railways for both passenger and
freight movement.
When the combustion engine was invented, we innovated and
adapted and built a nationwide network of highways and bridges
and fueling infrastructure for automobiles and trucks.
When the airplane was invented, we innovated and adapted
and built a robust, nationwide network of airports for
passengers and freight transport.
So, I am a bit perplexed by those who question the United
States ability to innovate and adapt and build a nationwide
network of zero-emission-fuel infrastructure. I think instead
of putting our collective heads in the sand, we should double
down on investments to innovate and adapt and ensure the United
States is on the cutting edge of innovation for our future.
So, my first question, Mr. Nigro, is to you. When this
committee debates electric vehicles, we often hear concerns
related to cost and range or technological barriers from those
who oppose EVs. And these challenges are real, but I believe
that American ingenuity has a role to play in solving them to
address the broader goal of reducing carbon pollution and,
certainly, sustaining life on our planet.
Your testimony notes that China and Europe together made up
85 percent of EV sales in 2023. If we don't act quickly, the
U.S. risks falling further behind.
What will happen if the U.S. concedes the race on this new
economic front to other countries?
Mr. Nigro. That is a big question, and the answer is
complicated, because it is going to depend, in part, on how the
industry responds in the near term.
So, as I mentioned in my testimony, China and Europe are
ahead of us right now when it comes to electrification. The
other facts are, the industry is committed to zero-emission
technology in part because they want to build vehicles for
those markets.
And so, the U.S. is currently playing catchup. With the
enactment of IIJA and IRA, we are catching up quite quickly. I
mentioned earlier the more than $140 billion of announced
investments in manufacturing across the EV supply chain here in
the United States in the last 4 years. So, that is a good sign.
But we are going to have to keep that going for at least
the next several years in order to get to capacity where we can
process minerals for batteries, assemble new vehicles, and,
frankly, build all the types of vehicles that the American
consumer wants.
For the most part, in the early days of the EV market, it
was focused on some of the higher end, more expensive luxury
vehicles. Slowly but surely, the market has started to offer
more and more affordable vehicles. And, in fact, this year, the
most popular conventional vehicles that were sold--think
vehicles like the Toyota Camry, the Ford F-150--they have
electric alternatives that, when you look at the whole
ownership cost of owning that EV in that conventional vehicle,
it is cheaper to own the EV.
And so, right now, we have vehicles that are out there that
are competitive, but we still have a ways to go.
Ms. Brownley. Thank you for that.
And so, also, I wanted to ask you: We have heard a lot
today already about concerns about the trucking sector's
ability to move forward with clean vehicles. Do you see reasons
to be optimistic that the U.S. can succeed in transitioning to
zero-emission commercial trucks?
Mr. Nigro. Yes. Yes, I do. And it is in part because,
again, the industry is stepping up. The three truck
manufacturers that make up nearly three-quarters of the medium-
and heavy-duty market--Daimler Truck, Volvo Group, and
Navistar--they aim to only sell zero-emission vehicles by 2040.
And so, these manufacturers, along with a handful of
fleets, logistics companies, charging developers, electric
utilities, all the key players in this industry, formed an
association just recently here in Washington called PACT, and
it is focused entirely on trying to get more zero-emission
infrastructure out there, which, frankly, appears to be the
biggest barrier right now to truck deployment, is making sure
the infrastructure can get deployed as quickly as the trucks
can be built.
Ms. Brownley. Thank you for that.
And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentlewoman yields.
Mr. LaMalfa.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
It just seems, about the only thing that we hear about, in
committee, on the floor, is CO2, climate change, all the time--
hounded, hounded, hounded.
And I like to go back to when California was incentivizing,
via regulation, moving people out of the trucks and buses they
had into cleaner vehicles, moving them to Tier 4. And there was
this implied promise that, once you get everything updated, out
of--2011 or newer engines, that once everything is Tier 4, we
will leave you alone for a while.
Yet what happens? This kick to electrify everything kicks
in during this administration. And now they want to electrify
everything from your car or your truck to your barbecue, OK?
Because it is just a fad now.
And I think that when we are mixing up what elements are
actually pollutants versus someone's idea of inconvenience--for
example, yes, we have to do better on methane, we have to do
better on particulate matter, NOx, things like that. But CO2 is
not this problem. All the time, we hear CO2 is the enemy.
So, I would like to ask the panel, what are we even
shooting at here? What is our goal here?
So, Mr. Nigro, you first. What percent of our atmosphere is
CO2?
Mr. Nigro. So, I have to tell you right upfront, I am an
engineer, not a climate scientist. And so, as an engineer, I
just know I can't learn everything about everything; I really
have to build my work on the shoulders of others. And, in this
case----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. OK. Well, let me--you are in
here, and you are part of a whole parade of people that comes
through this committee and others that never seems to know what
the target is.
For the rest of the panel, I will just save you. The
percent of our atmosphere that is CO2 is .04 percent. Yes, the
average person on the street, with all the hype, they think it
is somewhere between 20 and 50 percent. It is .04. Yes, it has
crept up a little bit in the last decades. But if we go below
.02 percent, plant life dies off. It is essential to plant
life.
Yet we are turning our economy up on its head because of
CO2 and the hype that is being made by all the regulators on
this. CO2 is not a poisonous gas unless you breathe 100 percent
of it. It is ridiculous, what is going on here.
And so, in converting everything to all this, we are doing
a giant disservice to our school districts, to our truckers, to
consumers that have to buy things that are delivered by things
that cost much more--a truck, for example, or a schoolbus.
Now, I saw one of my local districts bought an electric
schoolbus here. They are in the middle of farm country in
northern California. There must have been some massive grants
or incentive in order to do that, because they didn't just go
out and buy it themselves. These buses cost anywhere from
$150,000 to $220,000 is one of the figures I have. I hear
higher figures from folks in the other part of my rural
district, much higher numbers. They can't afford to do this.
So, panelists, anybody want to weigh in on how much is the
subsidy on the average truck or bus in order for somebody to
buy this?
Because we keep hearing we need to incentivize, we need
to--the Government needs to play a role in this. And the point
was made a while ago, the Government wasn't buying gas
stations, the Government wasn't propping up internal combustion
engines back when they first started really kicking in, in the
1920s and 1930s, whatever. People were doing it on their own.
Yes, we built the Interstate Highway System after General
Eisenhower saw how great that was in Europe and such.
But what is the real goal here, when we have had Tier 4
engines in California be the thing that we were supposed to
shoot for and now they have completely changed the game?
So, Ms. Okafor, you have those Love's truckstops. Please
weigh in on the impacts of truckers no longer being able to
afford the trucks and all the infrastructure, especially when
they are tearing out the infrastructure to generate electricity
in California, such as hydroelectric dams.
Mrs. Okafor. It is a wonderful question. Our focus is
providing the fuel that our customers need, and we believe
that, in order to move customers or consumers into a different
sort of fuel, they have to be incentivized to move in that
direction.
Mr. LaMalfa. But that costs a lot of money to the
taxpayers. We always say Government needs to do something. It
is the taxpayers that pays for all of this.
And so, time and time again, when Government says, ``well,
we have set new goals,'' it means they have goals that cost the
taxpayers money for something that, when I visit a Ford dealer,
people don't seem to want, OK? They don't seem to want these.
Ford is losing their rear end--like, $130,000 is the figure I
saw reported, per vehicle--because they have already reached
their saturation point with those.
I will yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Stanton.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Let me first say a brief word about the passing of our
colleague, Donald Payne, Jr.
I have been in Congress for three terms now; I have had a
chance to work with Congressman Payne as a leader here on the
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
He was an impactful leader in this body, certainly an
impactful leader inside the Democratic caucus. He was our
leader on rail safety issues, and he did an outstanding job at
an important time in America on the issue of rail safety.
He was an impactful leader on the issue of supporting and
advocating for people suffering from diabetes and bringing down
the cost of insulin and other pharmaceuticals that people
suffering from diabetes need.
He was a quiet leader, but a really impactful leader,
someone I respected greatly. And he will be greatly missed.
Arizona and my district have benefited from the
electrification dollars that came through the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law.
In January, the city of Mesa received nearly $12 million to
install 48 electric-vehicle charging ports, charging docks for
e-bikes and e-scooters, and solar canopies to support
electricity generation at the stations. These initiatives will
ensure that EV charging is accessible to all residents
regardless of their location or employment.
Last June, Valley Metro, Arizona's transit agency, was
awarded over $13 million to purchase zero-emission buses. And,
in 2022, the city of Phoenix received a $16 million Low-No
grant to buy hydrogen fuel cell buses, battery-electric buses,
and charging equipment as part of the initial phase of the
city's zero-emission transition plan.
These dollars are helping our local cities. Not only will
transitioning to electric buses lower emissions, but it will
significantly lower long-term fuel and maintenance costs,
saving taxpayer dollars.
But we are on an aggressive timeline, and we need to be
thinking strategically about how we use every tool in the
toolbox to future-proof both our bus fleets and our heavy-duty
fleets.
My bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Energy Efficiency and
Conservation Block Grant Program will provide grants to State,
local, and Tribal governments to support initiatives that will
reduce fossil-fuel emissions and conserve energy. It would
allow municipalities to use the funds to install fueling
equipment, pumps, EV charging stations, et cetera, to enable
the fueling of alternative-fuel vehicles, giving fleet managers
alternatives to the use of gasoline and diesel. This could
include providing equipment for refueling with bio-gas,
compressed natural gas, and hydrogen.
Ms. Okafor, your day-to-day work is managing EV charging,
hydrogen fueling, and solar businesses. You mention in your
testimony that any changes to transportation energy must work
for American consumers. I couldn't agree more. And that means
it must work for you to distribute it.
Can you describe how Love's has been working to integrate
electrification and hydrogen fueling into your business model?
Mrs. Okafor. Absolutely.
So, we started putting in our first EV charging stations
over 7 years ago throughout the country. And over the last 7
years, we have installed them at about 30 to 40 locations
across our network.
And what we have been doing for the last 7 years has been
learning: learning about the market, learning about driver
behaviors, utilization, how to charge for electricity as a
fuel. And we have learned a lot.
And because of all of the work that we have done over the
last several years, we have been able to attack NEVI as
aggressively as we have been. And happy to say that we have won
$30 million to date to build 50 new EV charging stations. It
has really been on the back of everything that we have learned
thus far. And our hope is to win even more money to build out
more of our network.
On the hydrogen fueling side of our business, we have taken
a different approach, a different lane. The Trillium portion of
the Love's Family of Companies, one of our major customer bases
is transit agencies. And transits have been moving much faster
on the hydrogen fuel cell side of the industry, of the market.
So, to date, we have designed and built and operated and
maintained five hydrogen fueling stations for transit agencies
behind the fence.
And if and when our heavy-duty customers need hydrogen
fueling at our Love's truckstops, we will be able to do so
quickly because of everything that we have learned with our
transit partners.
Mr. Stanton. That is really great.
You also talk about how bringing in alternative fuel does
not necessarily mean revamping the entire market. Can you
expand a little bit upon that?
Mrs. Okafor. Absolutely.
Our core is our customers. So, having a place for them to
fuel their vehicles is exactly what we do for them today, no
matter what the fuel type is.
What customers really want is reliable fuel, convenient,
and lowest cost fuel available. They also want amenities that
they are used to and that they need whenever they refuel their
vehicles. These amenities include fresh foods and different
items that they can purchase, places where they can sit and
eat, dog parks, clean restrooms; for mothers that are traveling
with children, diaper-changing areas. All of these. And most of
all, secure locations, well-lit parking lots where they can
charge and fuel their vehicle.
So, everything that our industry has been providing for the
past 60, 70, 80 years is everything that EV drivers need today.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you so much.
And I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Stauber.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you very much.
Appreciate the testimony from you all.
Ms. Okafor, great to see you again.
You mentioned in your testimony that you are concerned with
unfair competition, with utilities owning and operating
charging stations on the back of ratepayers. I am also
concerned about that.
Recently, we saw this debate play out in my State of
Minnesota, where a utility proposed to build, own, and operate
public charging sites. The project's multimillion-dollar
pricetag would have come from its own ratepayers. As you can
imagine, this received sharp criticism.
What would have happened to the market in Minnesota if the
Public Utilities Commission had approved that proposal?
Mrs. Okafor. Absolutely. I really appreciate the question.
And great to see you again as well.
The only way that we can get a return on our investment
when we install EV charging stations, or any fuel, is to make
sure that the customer experience is as positive as possible.
Our goal is to have consumers return to our sites to get fuel
as well as other amenities that they need when they stop to
refuel their vehicles. We have to ensure that our experience is
consistent and great every single time. That is the only way we
get a return on our investment.
For utilities that deploy charging stations and get their
return in other methods, that makes it such that there is an
unlevel playing field. They do not have to prioritize consumer
experience.
Mr. Stauber. So, I believe in an all-of-the-above energy
strategy and all the best will rise to the top.
Do you all agree that forcing the American consumer into
purchasing an electric vehicle is the way, or should we allow
the free markets to make that happen?
Does anyone want to comment on that?
Do you support the free markets and choosing--for the
American people to choose their own vehicles?
Mr. Darakos. From my standpoint, I do, Congressman, I
think, because it offers us flexibility, and it is going to
allow for the appropriate technology to move forward to support
whatever we are doing.
So, I think there is a great need to allow for that, moving
forward. And that is why we have a fleet that operates on
diesel. We are looking at renewable diesel. We have compressed-
natural-gas vehicles that have run within our fleet, and we are
looking at electric vehicles as well.
Mr. Stauber. Mr. Coggin, free market?
Mr. Coggin. Yes, sir. Current FTA regulations allow transit
systems like us to provide the types of services that our
community needs and operate the types of vehicles that meet
those operational needs. So, there are two issues here: There
is air quality, tailpipe emissions, and then there is budgetary
constraints. And we feel like what we are doing meets our
needs. We are reducing our tailpipe emissions in a cost-
efficient manner.
So, there is this talk about internal combustion engines
and the finances of that and the emissions. We chose to use
propane--and I am not here today to just talk about propane,
because we are operating a lot of things, and I am not anti
anything. But a propane bus costs the same as a diesel bus, and
propane is cheaper to operate. The cost per mile is cheaper
because the fuel is cheaper. A bonus is, we are reducing our
emissions. So, we are not fixated on CO2 and emissions. That is
a bonus.
The diesel engine requires diesel emission fluid, which is
very expensive, that you have to put in there. That goes into
the operating cost. It has been our experience that the diesel
emission control systems that are on these heavy-duty engines
that we run are very expensive to maintain. They are
cumbersome; they are not reliable. Frequently, the engines go
into what is called ``re-gen,'' where they are burning off
impurities----
Mr. Stauber [interposing]. Yes.
Mr. Coggin [continuing]. Because we do a lot of idling.
Diesel is not a good option at all.
So, propane is--the upfront cost is as much, and the
operating cost is much less.
Mr. Stauber. And I think you are seeing a lot of school
districts across the Nation going to propane buses just because
of that.
Ms. Okafor, Love's, where do they prioritize the location
of the charging stations at the businesses? Where do they
prioritize?
Mrs. Okafor. The priority is to have the charging stations
in a place where customers and consumers can actively find the
chargers and easily find the chargers.
I took a road trip from Oklahoma City to Houston in an
electric vehicle because I wanted to understand the experience
of an EV driver. And what I found is that, in a lot of cases,
it is hard to even find the charger. And it is hard to find a
charger that is co-located with amenities that I want because I
am sitting there for 20 to 40 minutes.
So, finding the charger has been our priority.
Mr. Stauber. Mr. Chair, if you would indulge me, I will
tell you that this Government has paid $7.4 billion for
electric vehicle chargers, and they have so far installed seven
of them, and it has been 2 years ago.
I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
The chair has been notified there is a series of votes.
Before we break for votes, I am going to recognize Mr. Garcia.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am
delighted, and thank you and the ranking member for hosting
this hearing about transitioning to clean, sustainable electric
vehicles.
In Chicago, Pace, one of our transit agencies, debuted its
first electric bus this past January, and they have 22 more
buses on order. This is not only a milestone for building a
sustainable transportation sector, but also for meeting demands
of rapid decarbonization.
There is concern over the limited number of bus
manufacturers and the lack of capacity to produce electric
buses needed in a timely manner.
Mr. Nigro, it is encouraging to see how many local transit
agencies want to transition to electric buses. How can we
ensure that our markets are prepared for this demand so that we
can complete orders on time?
Mr. Nigro. It is a great question. And industry will
respond with market certainty. So, when you provide it with
demand for a product like electric buses, they are going to
ensure that the manufacturing capacity is expanded to meet that
demand.
It is what we are seeing right now in passenger vehicles.
The Inflation Reduction Act set up a framework to encourage
domestic production and assembly of electric vehicles, and we
have seen $141 billion of announced investments as a result.
And so, as more transit agencies commit to zero-emission
vehicles, I would expect the supply to be made readily
available.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you.
Electric vehicle technology and infrastructure is critical
to a district like mine, surrounded by highways and industrial
development. With some of the worst air quality in the country,
cutting pollution from gasoline and diesel fuel would give my
constituents years of their lives back.
No Republicans voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, and
very few House Republicans voted for the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law. Yet their districts are reaping benefits of
those laws through new electric vehicle manufacturing plants
and the creation of jobs. And this is good.
Mr. Nigro, can you speak about the economic benefits and
jobs that districts across the country are seeing in the
electric-vehicle sector?
Mr. Nigro. Yes. So, I mentioned earlier, this is a once-in-
a-century transition. Going from internal combustion engines to
electric drive is a huge undertaking, and it is going to
require considerable investments in manufacturing across the
country. That is a competitive opportunity.
As I mentioned earlier, of the $141 billion that has been
announced since November of 2021, 80 percent of those
investments are flowing into Republican congressional
districts. So, the evidence is signaling that those districts
are setting up an environment that is attracting that kind of
investment and jobs: 160,000 jobs.
You mentioned earlier this importance of equity,
essentially reducing emissions for people who are experiencing
transportation emissions and what it does to their health.
Importantly, the jobs that are being created right now are also
encouraging investments in disadvantaged communities. So,
communities that have historically been left behind are now
front and center. And I think that is another positive effect
of what is going on right now.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you.
And we have seen efforts to unionize amongst autoworkers
opening new electric plants. Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga,
Tennessee, voted last week to unionize--the first southern
autoworkers to win their union in history.
Mr. Nigro, can we ensure that EV manufacturing benefits
disadvantaged communities and is done so with fair labor
contracts that support a new generation of sustainable careers?
Mr. Nigro. One of the benefits of electrification is the
amount of attention that is put on all aspects of building an
EV, from every aspect of the supply chain to the labor force
that is being put together to design, build, and deliver these
vehicles.
I think it is no coincidence that what you are seeing right
now in EV manufacturing facilities is greater interest in
ensuring that the jobs that are created are fair-paying and
good jobs that are really building new sustainable communities.
A lot of the facilities that are being built right now in
different parts of the country, they don't have, necessarily, a
tradition in the auto sector, so, this is a brandnew
opportunity for them to create a new sustainable community. And
with this increased attention, I think we are going to see more
positive results.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thanks again.
And, with that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Ms. Okafor, my questions will
be for you, or my conversation will be with you.
Your really great policy team at NATSO and SIGMA have
taught me that you all aren't in the gas-selling business; you
are in the serving-travelers business. Am I putting that right?
Mrs. Okafor. You have got it right.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. And in your testimony you talk
about being technology-neutral, but you don't--I mean, you are
not a partisan with regard to what fuel you are selling as long
as your company can make money doing it, right?
Mrs. Okafor. Absolutely.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. So, talk to me a little bit
about the negotiations with public utilities. And, obviously,
you have stores all over the place, so, I am sure you have a
variety of stories. But give me a sense of how that normally
goes.
Mrs. Okafor. Yes. You hit the nail on the head. We have
over 640 stores in 42 States. And, with that, you have hundreds
of utilities that we have to talk to, we have to partner with.
And we have been talking to them a lot lately because of the
work that we have been doing with NEVI.
And, really, the way the conversation goes is, we let them
know that we want to build an EV charging station. We ask them
for two things: How long will it take to get the power that we
need to our station, and how much will it cost?
In some cases, they give you an answer. It is usually
vague, because they haven't done the analysis themselves, which
makes it extremely difficult because, for the investment, the
utility portion is always a black box.
One example of that is, we were building out a charging
station out in Coachella, California. We had originally thought
that the utility upgrade there would cost $50,000. Come to find
out, the utility upgrade, whenever they did the engineering
analysis, would cost over $300,000 and take a year to install.
So, that uncertainty makes the investment challenging.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. I think everybody realizes
that the fuel part of your business is a pretty tight-margin
business. I assume that is true whether you are selling
electricity or gasoline. It is a little hard to recover a
$300,000 line extension fee, I would think.
Mrs. Okafor. It is difficult to recover that sort of
investment, especially when utilization is low.
The other thing that is difficult to recover is demand
charges. The demand charge is related to the number of
kilowatts that's utilized--the highest number of kilowatts
that's utilized over a 30-day period for 15 minutes. So, even
if you have one car come for 15 minutes and use 100 kilowatts,
you have a demand charge of $10 per kilowatt, you are talking
$1,000 that you have to recover. Well, that customer leaves and
pays $15; we are left holding the bill.
So, with utilization being as low as it is and the electric
rates for utilities across the country being challenging, it is
hard to recover the investments that we make and even the
operational costs that we incur.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. So, a lot of these components,
they are tariffed. I assume in some jurisdictions the utilities
have a little bit more flexibility than they do in others. But
I would assume something like demand charges are filed in
tariffs.
Do the public utilities commissions, do they provide a lot
of flexibility to these public utilities on how they charge you
for demand charge?
Mrs. Okafor. I am not particularly--I don't have very much
detailed information on how rate structures are chosen.
What I will say about rate structures is, because we don't
have any control over the rate that we pay, it can change
without my knowledge.
For instance, there was a charging station that we have out
in California. We reached a certain demand. And for certain
rates, if you reach a certain demand for a number of months,
they move you into a new rate structure, but they don't tell
you that they move you into a new rate structure. So, I was
looking at the P&L of our business, and I noticed that they
moved us, but I hadn't moved the cost that I charged to the
customer.
So, that lack of transparency, the lack of knowledge on
when things are happening and how they are happening, and the
lack of ability to choose a new provider puts us in a very
tight spot, and it makes the investment extremely challenging.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Am I right in assuming, Ms.
Okafor, that all of this unpredictability and relative lack of
control puts some downward pressure on your interest in making
these kinds of investments?
Mrs. Okafor. It certainly makes it extremely challenging.
At the end of the day, our goal is to provide the fuel that our
customers need, but, furthermore, the goal is to make a return
on our investment. And if the utilization isn't high and the
return is challenging, it makes it hard to make the investment.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Thanks very much for sharing
that.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
There is a floor vote called, a series of votes, so, I
appreciate the patience of our witnesses. We are going to have
to take a short recess to address that floor vote.
And so, the committee stands in recess, subject to the call
of the chair.
[Recess.] [12:59 p.m.]
Mr. Crawford. The Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure will reconvene from the previously recessed
hearing.
The gentleman, Mr. DeSaulnier, is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for this
hearing.
Just a couple of things.
The idea that the free market dictates everything, I think,
just--we really live in a mixed market, and the forces of
trying to get this right is difficult.
But if we look at the rest of the developed world, the
market has already determined what the energy future is, what
we have to do for infrastructure. The Chinese are adding
100,000 battery-electric charging stations and fuel cell
stations a month; the EU is about half of that.
California, which I am proud to represent--in 1994, I was
appointed by a Republican Governor, when I was a Republican, to
represent the Bay Area Air Quality Management District on the
California Air Resources Board.
And the Clean Air Act that allows California to do what it
has done, as I have mentioned to this committee before, was
signed by Richard Nixon. The California Clean Act was signed by
Governor Ronald Reagan. And the zero-emission vehicle mandate
was mandated by Governor George Deukmejian, a conservative
Republican from Fresno, where the fossil-fuel industry has
significant investments.
So, when we get this right, we are at what we used to refer
to on CARB in Republican administrations is, we were fuel-
neutral; that the private sector, underneath the regulations,
the laws, were allowed to incentivize and innovate to meet
their reductions on traditional pollutants, and then we have
been allowed to do that by the courts, so far, under carbon
emissions.
So, having said all of that, to me, this is economic
security. You don't have to read everything Daniel Yergin has
written about the fossil-fuel industry and energy industry to
understand that whoever controls energy has a disproportionate
advantage for their economy and for their constituents. His
book, ``The Commanding Heights,'' talked about the British
understanding wind and navigation or the U.S. and Europe
understanding fossil fuels. But the fossil-fuel industry is not
the free market.
I have a district where Chevron, the second largest
petroleum company, is headquartered. I have five refineries in
the area I represent, more or less, in the bay area. They are
important. They contribute significantly. But they are
subsidized.
Brookings did a study just a year ago that said that, in
the U.S., the fossil-fuel industry gets direct subsidies, tax
credits, of $500 billion a year. And that is a decision we and
others make because it is important, as employers, and is very
much needed for the economy.
Having said that, we are transitioning. Most of the studies
that I have read is, when we get the infrastructure done, not
just for carbon, but in terms of efficiency, the car
operations--trucks are more of a challenge, given the need for
the power to generate big loads. But all of that thing is to
say the Congress is important in figuring out how we transition
effectively.
And, within that, if the fossil-fuel industry can come up
with carbon capture or something that works, then so be it. But
this idea that somehow the fossil-fuel industry just happened
completely organically and John Rockefeller was a wonderful
person who didn't have sharp elbows is just not accurate.
So, Mr. Nigro, in your experience--and I am proud of the
fact that my bill, the Clean Corridors Act, got put in the
Inflation Reduction Act. But placing these are no small--it is
hard. And so were gas stations in the early 1900s. But getting
this right and being efficient about it and letting the market
to dictate within it fairly is a challenge, and not
misrepresenting it.
But my question to you is: If the Chinese are 60 percent of
the electric cars in the world, they have an advantage in terms
of the chemicals that are needed. And the National Labs at
Lawrence Livermore, near my district, has identified the Salton
Sea, prospectively, as being a source of those critical
elements, up to 375 million, but we have to do it the way we do
it, environmentally safe.
So, briefly--that was a long introduction to a simple
question--what happens if we don't do the right investments and
we just keep going with fossil fuels the way that we always
have?
Mr. Nigro. Well, I will try to be respectful of the time
here and say briefly that the costs of climate change have
continued to rise within recent decades. That is the data from
NOAA that is showing $2.7 trillion in total cost since 1980. I
think we can expect the cost from climate-related disasters to
accelerate as a result of us not reducing emissions
sufficiently.
The other flag I would give to you is the security
implications of that. Part of the reason I moved to Washington
a long time ago was what I perceived to be our dependence on
oil and the national-security crises that resulted from that in
the early 2000s. I don't think anyone in this room would want
to repeat those experiences again.
And so, there are many facets of fossil-fuel dependency
that are hurting us, whether it is the planet, our economy, or
our safety.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman
Ms. Maloy [presiding]. Thank you.
The gentleman yields back.
And I recognize Mr. Owens from Utah for 5 minutes for
questions.
Mr. Owens. Thank you, Chair and Ranking Member and our
witnesses here today, for taking time to hold today's hearing
to highlight the delusion of the Biden administration's at-any-
cost approach on electrification of our grid.
For almost 60 years, Americans have been driven by fear
perpetuated by our climate theorists, authors, climate
absolutists, and climate change activists, all who consider
themselves experts--these experts who, for decades and with
total confidence, set dates every 10 years for the end-of-the-
world doom. Then, with no shame, as we run through those dates,
they predict, with another 100 percent confidence, another 10-
year decline.
For decades, we have witnessed American taxpayers
supporting Government-generated wealth. This has been done by
propping up industries through the power of bureaucratic
mandates and subsidies, in direct contrast to best cost, most
convenient, best value products offered through the free
market.
Nothing has been more apparent with this tactic than the
$18 billion taxpayer funding of a mandated industry that
America's private citizens and business owners do not want to
be forced down their throats.
This can be seen in the projections by the Biden
administration on the growth demand of EVs over the next 6
years. Biden DC bureaucrats, absent any actual industry input,
have decided what the American consumer must buy by 2030. That
is in 6 years. They have decided that 50 percent of all
American car purchasers will buy an EV, whether they like it or
not.
The facts are that, as of 2023, only 7 percent of cars
purchased by the American consumer were EVs. Yet this
unrealistic leap to 43 percent in 6 years has not caused one
moment of pause for the DC maestros.
We would think that the first steps to meet such an
aggressive growth goal, one that impacts our U.S. economy in so
many ways, would have been a roundtable discussion with
industry experts. These experts would have included utilities
stakeholders, cybersecurity experts, truckdrivers, State DOTs,
and a swath of working Americans who stake their livelihood on
predictable transportation.
Of course, this taking the industry's input never happened.
If it had, the advice from the industry experts and
stakeholders would been: Put on the brakes. Your projection and
mandates for this industry are premature at best, very
dangerous at worst.
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses to learn how
arbitrary and delinked-from-reality mandates and rules have
affected everyday, working-class Americans. I would also like
to see what this committee can do to mitigate the coming
transportation one-size-fits-all nightmare that is being
predicted by industry experts.
Mr. Darakos, trucking is already a high-risk industry with
very slim margins. Can you speak to reliability and durability
of electric vehicles and some of the challenges and limitations
your drivers might face?
Mr. Darakos. Sure. Thank you for that question.
As the vice president of maintenance, my focus is on
keeping the fleet rolling. So, operational uptime is really
critical.
I think, where we are at today, we are early in the
maturity of the technology in those vehicles. So, the trucks
that we put in, they are more complex. We have seen some
downtime with those vehicles. And as opposed to a day in the
shop, it can be a much longer period of time to work through
those repair processes. So----
Mr. Owens [interrupting]. OK.
I am going to ask you another question. I also serve on the
Education and Workforce Committee. So, from the labor
perspective, what type of training and technologies would
drivers be forced to utilize to meet the Biden administration's
very aggressive goals?
Mr. Darakos. So, from a workforce training standpoint, at
PITT OHIO, we are in the transition--we are a 45-year-old
company, so, we have folks that are retiring every day. And,
from a knowledge and education standpoint, I have technicians
that are very diverse in terms of age, age diversity.
So, there is a heavy investment in electrical knowledge
when we are dealing with high-voltage equipment. There is an
absolute need to put resources into the tech programs,
workforce development. The ecosystem has to be developed to
support this.
The reality today is, when you look at electrification and
this technology, dealers are certified if they have two
technicians so that they can do the work. But the reality is,
technicians don't always stay in one place, and life happens.
So, we have to invest heavily in building this next generation
of technicians that will support the technology.
Mr. Owens. Yes.
Ms. Okafor, I would like to ask you real quickly, with the
industry that you run and work within, why is it important to
allow the consumer to be at the very front of making these
choices, in terms of how we spend and where we spend our time
and energies?
Mrs. Okafor. Absolutely. I appreciate the question.
The best way to get consumers to buy EVs is to make them
what they want, to make the experience of owning the EV better
than the alternative.
When we incentivize the market to move in that direction,
the entire supply chain is consumer-based. When we mandate it,
we take shortcuts, such as installing chargers in parking lots
and other undesirable locations.
I understand the temptation to mandate EVs or to ban gas
vehicles, but there are no shortcuts. We need to make sure that
consumers have what they want and make it what they want it to
be.
Mr. Owens. Thank you.
I will yield back. Thank you so much.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you.
The gentleman yields back.
And I recognize Mr. Johnson of Georgia for 5 minutes for
questions.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Madam Chair.
And I thank the witnesses for your forbearance. That was a
long period where we were absent. And I appreciate your all's
testimony and you all sticking around for this round of
testimony.
I want to read to you something that comes out of a
Bloomberg News article, dated March 28, 2024, written by Tom
Randall. It goes as follows:
``New technologies have a tendency to blindside. When color
TVs were introduced in the 1950s, for example, they seemed like
a flop. The devices were expensive, programming was scarce, and
after a decade on the market few homes had one. Then suddenly
prices dropped, a ratings war ensued, and in just a few years
most U.S. households were watching `The Jetsons' in its
futuristic palette.
``A comparable shift is currently underway with electric
vehicles, according to a Bloomberg Green analysis of adoption
rates around the world. By the end of last year, 31 countries
had surpassed what's become a pivotal EV tipping point: when 5
percent of new car sales are purely electric. This threshold
signals the start of mass adoption, after which technological
preferences rapidly flip.''
Mr. Darakos, in your testimony, you address the costs of
transitioning to cleaner fuels, and you call for a slower
transition. But if we fail to act soon, the clean-vehicle
market is going to develop in other countries, particularly
China.
Has the ATA considered the cost to the industry if, in the
future, we become reliant on China or other foreign nations for
our commercial motor vehicles?
Mr. Darakos. Could you repeat the last part?
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Yes. If we fail to act soon about
adopting electric vehicle technology, we will be left behind.
And has the ATA considered the cost to the industry if in the
future we become reliant on other nations, particularly China,
for our commercial motor vehicles?
Mr. Darakos. Thank you. I think when you look at the
American Trucking Associations, even at PITT OHIO, I don't
think anybody is putting the brakes on moving forward with the
technology. I think what we are saying is that there is a
diversity of technology needed to support supply chain. And
when you look at how critical supply chain is to what we do on
a day-to-day basis, we cannot put technology in place that is
not going to allow your goods to get to your operation.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. If we slow down everything, we slow
down everything. So, if we adapt as we move forward adapting,
we will have the infrastructure that will rest or come to rest
in place to support these commercial motor vehicles. So, I
mean, I understand the fear of it not being there right now,
but the technology and all of its attendant services and
necessities will be there as it unfolds, just like it has been
in the past.
Ms. Okafor, could you comment about this transition to EV
technology and EV vehicles?
Mrs. Okafor. Absolutely. Thank you for the question.
Love's has supported policies that encourage investments in
alternative fuels and reward businesses that make those
investments. What it makes me think about is our biofuels
business. Love's has been a leader in biofuel blending in the
industry. And the way that that market has been incentivized is
twofold. On one side there was an infrastructure incentive. On
the other side there was an incentive on the energy or the
fuel. So, it made the fuel lower cost to the consumer.
On the EV charging side, we have the infrastructure
incentive, and we are aggressively going after it. What we are
missing is the incentive on the demand, the fuel to get it low
cost to the customers so that fleets can have an attractive
option for their operations.
So, I believe once incentives are included on the demand
side to incentivize customers to buy these new technologies,
then the market will be consumer-oriented, consumer-driven, and
it would move much faster.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. So, you think we should incentivize
the acceleration of the conversion to EV vehicles rather than
slow down?
Mrs. Okafor. I think that we--in order to move to new
technology similar to what we did in the biofuel space, the way
that--what made it move was making the alternative technology
solution a better solution than the traditional solution. So,
making it better than what the traditional solution is would
provide an opportunity for fleets to continue with their
operations.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, and I yield back.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentleman yields back.
And I recognize Mr. Ezell from Mississippi for 5 minutes
for questions.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Madam Chairman. And thank you all for
being here today.
And we all want better. We all want better transportation.
We all want a better environment. And I think we can figure
this out with good old American know-how in a timely manner.
So, Mr. Coggin, thank you again for being here today. It is
an honor for somebody from my district to be up. And all of you
witnesses have just been--opened my eyes to a lot, especially
since I--I do travel to the Love's stations quite regularly in
my home State and going back and forth to see my granddaughter.
So, thank you all.
Mr. Coggin, you have done a great job. And we all know what
you have done for us on the coast, providing reliable service
for many decades.
As the cost of fuel has risen, you have adapted by
transferring a portion of your fleet to low-emissions propane
fuel buses rather than all electric. This must have been a
challenging decision, especially in more rural areas. Can you
talk about some of the steps that you took before finalizing
this transfer and how it has impacted your fleet?
Mr. Coggin. Yes, sir. I have been doing this a long time. I
have personally been really watching technology evolve for
decades, trying to find the right fit for Coast Transit
Authority. So, we have two issues that we consider at our
transit system: the air/the environment and budget constraints.
So, we are phasing out all of our diesel because of
emissions and the high cost of operating diesel. We have chosen
to go with propane short term in the small and midsized
vehicles because they are much cleaner. They cost about the
same to purchase upfront, but the operating cost is much less
than a diesel engine bus. Fuel consumption, the cost per mile
is much, much lower than diesel, and we get the benefit of
lowering emissions. So, we have clean air. We are not a
nonattainment area. Thank goodness. Hopefully, we won't be.
But we also are looking at EV, full-electric buses.
Technology is advancing on the small to midsized buses
currently. What is on the market is not a fit because of cost.
And mileage constraints range. We have those two things. Yes,
they are zero emission. If we were in a poor-quality area,
nonattainment, we would most definitely be looking at full
electric EV. But EV is the most expensive solution to lowering
emissions.
So, we think we have found the right mix for our community.
And our community does expect us to be running alternative fuel
vehicles. But we have cost constraints going--we are funded by
five cities and three counties. And because we don't have bad
air quality issues, I cannot go to our local governments and
ask them to fund EV technology. But at this point in time, it
is not a necessity for us. So, the funding is just simply not
there.
Mr. Ezell. Very good. Thank you for that.
And the Biden administration seems to try to, what we see,
continue this one-size-fits-all policies across industries.
This is especially true in transportation. You know as well as
I do: that works for someone in a large city, but it is not
going to work in Gulfport, Mississippi.
You mentioned in your testimony you feel strongly about no
Federal mandates. How can the Federal Government serve as a
partner in enhancing the transportation goals in our
communities and without Federal mandates?
Mr. Coggin. We currently do not have a Federal mandate.
There are goals set by the administrations, and we have agreed
with 50 percent emission reductions by 2030. We are on track to
do that, utilizing the technologies that I talked about. So,
there currently is no mandate.
Federal Transit Administration does support alternative
technologies other than zero emission. If you look at the low-
no grant system, which is $1 billion a year to 5339(c), it is
called, there is a specific allocation in that dedicated to
low-emission vehicles, and we take advantage of that. We
currently have a $1.8 million grant that we received under that
program to buy these 12 propane-fueled vehicles.
And so, to answer your question, what could FTA do going
forward is to keep the regs like they are, allow us the
flexibility to operate the buses that we need to meet our
service needs in our environment in a cost-effective manner,
and continue to allow other than zero-emission vehicles to be
purchased with Federal grants. We would appreciate that, and
also, more money into that system. There is a lot more money
requested in all of those grants to purchase vehicles than is
currently available.
We are all struggling, and CTA is as well, with older
fleets, trying to replace them, and there is just not enough
Federal money in those programs to keep our vehicles in a state
of good repair.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you very much.
And thank you, again, all of you, for providing us with
input.
Madam Chair, I yield back.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentleman yields back.
And I recognize Mr. Menendez from New Jersey for 5 minutes
for questions.
Mr. Menendez. Thank you, Madam Chair.
In January, New Jersey received a $6 million grant to
improve EV charging reliability in the State. And last
November, NJ Transit and New York Waterway received a nearly $7
million grant from the FTA's past year ferry grant program
funded by the IIJA to electrify two commuter ferries in New
Jersey's Eighth Congressional District. I was thrilled to
support these crucial investments in electrification in our
region to help keep our air clean and our community moving.
We know that thanks to the historic funding from the
Inflation Reduction Act, transit agencies across the country
have received grants to kick-start their conversion to greener
fleets. We also know that these transit agencies are often
operating with limited budgets or even at a deficit.
Mr. Nigro, how important are these Federal dollars to help
transit agencies acquire more climate-friendly vehicles?
Mr. Nigro. It is absolutely essential. Right now, many
transit agencies struggle to cover capital costs and rely on
Federal programs from FTA in order to purchase new equipment,
whether that be for buses or trains.
When we look at the transition to zero-emission vehicles,
there is a considerable amount of upfront costs that is also
needed in order to operate these vehicles and with respect to
infrastructure. And that is another strong role for
particularly the low-no program that has been mentioned a few
times in order to support the build-out.
I just want to flag a couple of things just for your
information on this trend here. So, zero-emission technology
is--it is still in its, let's say, its first wave across the
economy, even though there has been transit buses that have
been electric on the road for some time. We still have a long
way to go. But the trends that are clear, seven States had
zero-emission bus deployments rise by about 50 percent in the
last year. And the largest transit agency, seven largest
transit agencies in the country that operate buses--so, L.A.'s
transit agency, Boston's transit agency, WMATA here in DC--they
make up more than 60 percent of the total fleet, and they have
each committed to purchasing only zero-emission buses in the
next 8 years. So, they are going to rely on low-no and similar
programs from FTA in order to make that transition.
Mr. Menendez. Absolutely. And we know that climate change
and pollution have a disproportionate impact on environmental
justice communities. We also know that while EVs stand to
improve health outcomes for Americans across the country,
access to charging infrastructure remains a challenge, as we
discussed here today, especially for renters in underserved
populations.
Mr. Nigro, how can we ensure equitable access to zero-
emission vehicles for everyone, particularly in historically
underserved communities?
Mr. Nigro. I am glad you brought that up because part of
the purpose of the NEVI program and the CFI program is to fill
in infrastructure gaps. It is not entirely building on
infrastructure from scratch. We have had thousands of charging
stations deployed in the last 10 years before NEVI, before the
IIJA was enacted.
A big part of what it is going to mean for consumers who
don't get to charge at home, which is somewhere near 35 percent
of the population of households don't have easy access to home
charging, is going to be through public charging through--and
some of that is going to be funded through CFI and through
NEVI.
I want to just mention that while we are talking about
this, without funding from public programs, it is likely that
that charging wouldn't necessarily be deployed in disadvantaged
communities in part because EVs aren't as popular in those
areas at this time. And part of it is that we all talk about
chicken and egg in a lot of scenarios. This is real.
If you park on the street or if you park in a parking
facility that doesn't have easy access to home charging and you
are a renter, you probably don't have an easy way to install a
charging station at your home, and so, you are going to rely on
public charging. And if there are no EVs there, there's not
necessarily going to be a private push. And that is where
Government can help lead the way, and also electric utilities.
They have been an instigator in getting charging in a lot of
disadvantaged communities in some areas.
Mr. Menendez. And I appreciate that. And we represent one
of the most densely populated districts in the country, and so,
we have a high number of renters, and making sure they have
access to these EV charging facilities is critically important,
because there is a move and there is a demand, especially in a
place like New Jersey. So, we have to be a good partner here at
the Federal level to ensure that we provide those resources to
get those EV charging stations and infrastructure into all
types of communities. And that is why this work is so
critically important.
Thank you all for your testimony here today, and I yield
back.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentleman yields back.
And I recognize Mr. Yakym of Indiana for 5 minutes of
questions.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. And thank you to
our witnesses for being here today.
Back in December, this subcommittee hosted top Department
of Transportation officials for an oversight hearing. This
included Shailen Bhatt, who heads the Federal Highway
Administration, or FHWA.
The FHWA oversees the National Electric Vehicle
Infrastructure Program, or NEVI, which is devoted to building
out EV charging infrastructure. NEVI is flush with $5 billion
of cash, as it was, and yet is responsible for bringing only
two charging stations online through the end of last year. This
is something we talked about in the hearing last year.
I want to register my disappointment because I asked
Administrator Bhatt in that hearing how many charging stations
his agency projected that NEVI would bring online this year, in
2024. He didn't have an answer offhand. Fair enough. But he
promised to, quote, ``follow up with a very specific number.''
Three months later, I finally received a response, but no,
quote, ``very specific number.'' Just a promise that NEVI and
other related programs would, quote, ``ensure that a rapidly
increasing number of reliable EV chargers will be operational
around the country this year'', unquote.
I suppose in one sense NEVI has been bringing charging
stations online at a rapidly increasing pace in 2024. There
have been an additional six NEVI-funded charging stations
placed in service thus far this year. But $5 billion was
supposed to be enough funding for 5,000 charging stations. And
yet after 2\1/2\ years, we have 8.
It is clear to me that NEVI has become yet another example
of the Federal Government wasting taxpayer dollars by gumming
up a program with redtape. In this case, it is unworkable labor
standards, confusing minimum operating standards, rigid mileage
requirements that prompted at least one State to ultimately
decline NEVI funds altogether. That's not mentioning
permitting, transmission, and other hurdles that grantees may
encounter along the way.
Ms. Okafor, what actions could FHWA take today to reduce
redtape and streamline this process?
Mrs. Okafor. I appreciate the question.
The NEVI program that has been deployed is being passed out
by State DOTs, State agencies. They come up with competitive
solicitations, bids, for folks like Love's to bid on. To date,
we have been awarded $30 million for 50 new stations.
There is a pretty lengthy process to get from the bid phase
to actually procuring the chargers. The bid itself takes time,
contracting takes time, and then you have to go into the
procurement of the chargers themselves.
The thing that is difficult with NEVI is that the Federal
rulemaking gave quite a bit of leeway to States. So, each State
analyzes or understands the Federal rulemaking differently. And
because of that, they are deploying or awarding these funds
differently. One of the goals of NEVI is to have a harmonious
network across the country.
The most important thing from our perspective is to ensure
that there is a positive consumer experience, which means co-
location of amenities with these chargers and the requirement
of co-location of amenities----
Mr. Yakym [interrupting]. So, in that regard, again, what
steps do you believe they should take when you talk about the
regulatory environment, the rulemaking process? What specific
steps should they take to make this more streamlined so that in
2\1/2\ years we can push out more than eight chargers on a $5
billion program? Give me like maybe one specific thing that
they could do to make this a little more efficient.
Mrs. Okafor. I think more straightforward rulemaking
guidance that all States can take on. What I mean by that is,
each State looks at the Federal rulemaking and comes up to
their own interpretation of what it means. And because of that,
each solicitation is completely different.
Mr. Yakym. So, it is fair to say that the rulemaking that
occurred created confusion with the States where no one
actually understands what the rules are? Is that--does that
sound like that is--am I hearing you correctly?
Mrs. Okafor. I can't speak for the States on what they
understand or what they don't understand. What I will say is
the differences and the interpretations between the States
makes it so that the applicants--each solicitation is
different, and it makes it so that the applicants take more
time because each State is different.
Mr. Yakym. So, on behalf of my constituents, the 750,000
people who are American taxpayers, do you believe that American
taxpayers should accept the fact that there are only eight
charging stations out there from $5 billion?
Mrs. Okafor. I can't speak to that specifically. What I can
say is that all of the solicitations that have come out that
make sense for our organization, we have bid on those
aggressively. We have been really competitive in that. Because
of that we have been awarded, and we hope to continue to be
awarded.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you. And, Madam Chair, I yield back.
Ms. Maloy. The gentleman yields back.
And I recognize Mr. Molinaro from New York for 5 minutes
for questions.
Mr. Molinaro. Thank you, Madam Chair.
I think I am going to follow up a little bit on the last
set of questioning. But I want to offer--and I come from New
York where we have big expectations, but I don't necessarily
mean on the deliverables when it comes to full build-out of EV
capacity. And I certainly embrace sort of the all-of-the-above
approach without question.
I also think, however, it should be driven by consumer
interest and the market. And, of course, at this point, when it
comes to EV vehicles, we know that the demand is not moving as
aggressively as was originally projected. And in communities
like the ones I represent, there is a reason why. They seem
unattainable in the capacity to access EV charging, whether it
is stations themselves or the infrastructure just doesn't
exist.
And so, Ms. Okafor, I know you have answered these types of
questions all afternoon or day at this point. Where do you
think we are in the total build-out nationwide in EV charging
capacity, but in particular in rural communities?
Mrs. Okafor. I really appreciate the question. What it
makes me think about is the network that our industry has built
over the last 60 years and being able to leverage the refueling
network that has been built by this industry and how it is
going to be extremely useful.
The place that rural communities has to play in the EV
charging market is extremely significant. For EV drivers, the
majority of drivers either charge at home or at their
workplace. But when they are traveling from--I live in Houston
and I travel to Dallas, that is when I will need an EV charger.
And I am going to charge in between Houston and Dallas in the
rural communities. So, the rural communities have a very
significant place in this market.
And our locations--Love's--the majority of our locations
are in those areas. And it will be really important for this
market to move forward with having those in-between sort of
locations.
Mr. Molinaro. Understood. But you would agree that meeting
the expectations of the administration, the mandates that are
being set, we are just not--this is not my observation--we are
just not going to meet those expectations with the current
infrastructure, in particular in rural communities. And I will
move, though, specifically to what are, I think in many cases,
a bit overly ambitious mandates.
How do rural communities not get forgotten? They will be
averaged out, in other words, right? We will make great
capacity expansion in urban centers, in more densely populated
areas. But in the rural communities, they are just going to be
a rounding error when it comes to whether or not the
administration meets the mandate expectation. How do we meet
the build-out capacity in the rural communities?
Mrs. Okafor. It is really going to be extremely dependent
on getting the power to the rural communities that are needed
for the EV charging stations. If I think about our network that
we have today, one of our highest--we have two locations that
perform very highly. One is in Quartzsite, Arizona; the other
one is in Davenport, Florida. We are not talking about major
metropolitan areas. We need rural communities. But making sure
that we can get the power to these stations will be extremely
important.
Mr. Molinaro. So, that truly is the answer to the question.
And certainly in a State like New York where, quite frankly,
much of our electric infrastructure is, well, high demand and
under great stress. The EPA recently issued a final rule which
requires truck manufacturers to accelerate production of
electric trucks, obviously, beyond the massive upfront cost
that small businesses will be required to shoulder. As a result
of the new rule, we know there needs to be an increase in grid
capacity. We know this--and the suggestion has been capacity
needs to increase by over 3,000 percent by 2035 in order to
meet just the electric light-duty vehicle load.
So, for any of you, from a place like the communities I
represent, this just doesn't seem practical. And I am sort of
a--I was a local government guy. We set expectations that we
can meet, and it just doesn't seem that we can meet these
expectations. With 30 seconds left, how do we meet an
aggressive timeline like that?
Mr. Nigro. The good news is we have a lot of actual grid
capacity that is underutilized at night, which is when most
folks are parked at home, particularly folks who live in rural
communities. What we have seen so far with the deployment of
some millions of EVs to date is there hasn't been a lot of
issues with respect to the grid, in part because 65 percent of
Americans live in single-family homes and have the easy access
to power in their garage or near there. That is not to say that
it is not going to be a lot work to get to 100 percent, but
there is a large share of the market that can be accommodated
with the existing grid capacity.
Mr. Molinaro. I am over my time, and I will just say,
respectfully, that is an oversimplification of the challenge in
rural communities in accessing affordable electricity; let
alone, adequate electricity for this purpose is far beyond the
reach of many, many, in rural, in less than suburban
communities.
With that, I will yield back.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. I was afraid I was going to have to
use my gavel, Mr. Molinaro. The gentleman yields back.
And I recognize Mr. Kiley from California for 5 minutes for
questions.
Mr. Kiley. Thank you, Madam Chair.
I would just ask straight out--I am from California. We
have this executive action that has banned gas-powered vehicles
starting in 2035.
Mr. Darakos, do you think that that is feasible? And
regardless of whether it is feasible or not, what will be the
consequences for consumers of trying to reach that point within
the next decade?
Mr. Darakos. I think it is aggressive in terms of the
technology and where it is. And I think early adoption,
participation now will start to drive some of the costs down.
But based on what I see, it is going to increase consumer cost
to all of us. When we look at the cost of the new technology,
we are not talking about 0.5 or 0.6 more, we are talking 3X and
4X, and that is without the infrastructure investments----
Mr. Kiley [interrupting]. 3X and 4X meaning three times as
many vehicles?
Mr. Darakos. Correct. That is correct. Well, three to four
times the cost of a traditional vehicle.
Mr. Kiley. Three to four times the cost, right, of a
traditional vehicle. And so, a significant cost increase for
consumers.
Do you agree, Mr. Coggin, as far as the feasibility and the
impacts?
Mr. Coggin. Yes, I do. It is very costly. Electric is the
most expensive solution. If you look at a 35-foot heavy-duty
bus, which we are running, the diesel model is $670,000. The
hybrid, which is a diesel-engine driving hybrid, is currently
$855,000, 28 percent more. And the electric version is
$1,150,000, which is 35 percent more. That does not include the
cost of the charger. We paid $135,000 for a charger that will
charge two buses. And we had to upgrade our power supply from
the power company for $40,000. So, it is very expensive upfront
to implement these EV technologies.
Mr. Kiley. So, this is a big impact for folks in my State
who are already struggling with the highest cost of living in
the country, highest poverty rate in the country precisely
because of the cost of living, so, to layer on all of those
additional costs will pose a major hardship for drivers, which
is why I am supporting the Preserving Choice in Vehicle
Purchases Act, which says that we are not going to do these
bans of gas-powered vehicles within these artificial timelines.
It passed the House with bipartisan support, but it has yet to
get a vote in the Senate. So, I think that I would strongly
encourage the Senate to move on that bill in order to preserve
choice. Because we all, I think, are excited about what the
future holds in terms of clean energy.
And, Ms. Okafor, you work with a lot of clean energy
technologies. Is it your experience that what drives innovation
in the clean energy sector is more the work of innovators or
mandates on the part of Government?
Mrs. Okafor. It really is--it more has to do with the
consumer's choice. The consumer has to want to move to this new
alternative, and we have to provide an environment where they
want to move from what they traditionally are using to the new
alternative.
Mr. Kiley. Thank you. I have always been of the view that
the way that we can usher in the clean energy future that I
think is in front of is through innovation rather than
regulation. And I think that these flat-out bans within an
arbitrary timeline are sort of the ultimate example of
overbearing regulation.
I wanted to ask you about one other topic, Mr. Coggin,
related to buses, because I have talked with several school
districts within my district where they get extreme weather,
where they get a lot of snow, and having electrified buses just
isn't practical for them. Has that been your experience as
well?
Mr. Coggin. Well, we live in an area that does not have
snow, so, we are fortunate there. But we have a lot of heat,
extreme heat, and we run air conditioners. I have heard of the
cold weather-related problems with EV vehicles. I don't have
any personal experience with them. We do not in our area of the
country have a problem with our EV vehicles.
In terms of range, I think it speaks to the point that, in
our industry, public transit, we would like to continue to have
the flexibility to operate the types of vehicles that meet our
operational needs and our climate, with our weather and our
geography, all things considered. I think that would be what I
would point out. It is strictly a local decision, what works
for the individual organizations.
Mr. Kiley. That is very well said. Because the school
districts I am referring to are very rural, spread out areas,
get a lot of snow, and a one-size-fits-all mandate from a
centralized bureaucracy just doesn't work for them.
Thank you very much. I yield back.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentleman yields back.
And I recognize Mr. Burchett from Tennessee for 5 minutes
for questions.
Mr. Burchett. Thank you, ma'am. It is good to see some
names up there that will be just as much butchered as mine will
today. So, I just want to thank y'all for that.
Mr. Okafor? Did I get that right? Close?
Mrs. Okafor. Mrs. Yes.
Mr. Burchett. Mrs., yes, ma'am. OK.
It seems like truckstops in east Tennessee such as Pilot or
Love's have alternative fuel types at their facilities. Is the
Federal Government currently, in your opinion, standing in the
way of development or deployment of alternative fuel types
other than electricity?
Mrs. Okafor. Would you restate the question, please?
Mr. Burchett. Yes, ma'am. I will cut through all the fluff.
It is about alternative fuel types at facilities, specifically
in east Tennessee. I am wondering, is the Federal Government
currently standing in the way of development or deployment of
alternative fuel types other than electricity?
Mrs. Okafor. I wouldn't say they're standing in the way.
The alternative fuel types that we--maybe I'll say two things.
One, we deploy whatever our customers need. So, if our
customers need electricity or renewable diesel, biodiesel,
ethanol, then we deploy that infrastructure.
The second thing is that we follow policy extremely
closely. So, we have supported other Federal Government-
incentivized infrastructure, and we have invested in that, and
we continue to support those sorts of investments. So, moving
into alternative fuels, if the investment makes sense, we will
continue to do that.
But what I will reiterate is a two-sided incentive
structure is extremely important, not only incentivizing the
infrastructure side, but also the demand side, the energy, the
fuel that goes to the customer. If you don't incentivize that
side, then you continue to have an economic structure that is
extremely imbalanced and investment will cease.
Mr. Burchett. Thank you.
Mr. Nigro, our Nation is over $34 trillion in debt, and it
seems like many rural Americans are struggling. And given that
the average American-produced EV costs $53,000, why do you
think this administration is pushing EV-related mandates on
these hard-working folks?
Mr. Nigro. I am very glad you brought that up. I think your
stat probably is correct about the average price of an electric
vehicle. The thing that is important for all Americans to keep
in mind when they are buying a vehicle is most of the cost is
in the owning, ownership cost of it, right, the cost of fuel,
the cost of maintenance. We ran the numbers on the most popular
vehicles of different types--the F-150, Toyota Camry, Toyota
Corolla, and an electric vehicle equivalent--for sure, upfront,
they cost more. But over time, through fuel cost savings, since
most people can charge at home at very low cost, you end up
actually saving money in the long run over what is called the
total cost of ownership.
So, counterintuitively, EVs are actually less expensive to
own in general, particularly in passenger vehicles.
Mr. Burchett. I am going to follow up with that, if that is
OK. In March, the EPA announced a final rule that would require
up to two-thirds of new cars and trucks sold in the U.S. to be
EVs in 8 years. The President's EV mandate, I feel like, is a
little bit out there. We don't have the infrastructure, the
power generation, nor the domestic supply chain to meet these
demands. I am often wondering, too, is people, they don't take
into consideration the slave labor that is involved with these
batteries; the fact that these so-called rare earth minerals,
that maybe we could get here if there weren't some of the
restrictions that apply to us that don't apply to our friends
and enemies overseas.
Mr. Nigro. Right. Sorry, so, what is the----
Mr. Burchett [interrupting]. Would you like to comment on
that?
Mr. Nigro. On critical minerals?
Mr. Burchett. Yes, sir.
Mr. Nigro. Sure. Yes, yes. I think that is a really
critic--no pun intended, critically important issue. And it is
really top of mind for anyone who is involved in EVs, in part
because no one that works in this technology wants to repeat
the mistakes that we had made with oil and all of the tragedies
that resulted from human rights abuses and other things around
the development and extraction of oil over the last 100 years,
not to mention the harm it has caused the planet.
I think when we are thinking about critical minerals, there
are two major things we have to keep in mind. One, batteries,
obviously, go into EVs, but they also go into what is in our
pockets, what is in our laptops. So, it is a much broader issue
than just transportation. And secondly, nearly 95 percent of
the critical minerals that go into a battery can actually be
reused.
A recent study by Stanford University estimated that
innovative homegrown recycling from a company based in
California called Redwood Materials, they can cut the
environmental cost by 80 percent. And they are expected--this
company is expecting to recycle enough materials for 1 million
EVs a year by 2025. So, not an immediate solution, but there is
a pathway where we don't have to be as dependent on developing
countries for that.
Mr. Burchett. As usual, when I get going down a good tunnel
here, the time runs out. Madam Chairwoman, I yield back nothing
to you.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you for nothing. The gentleman yields
back.
And I recognize Mr. Duarte from California for 5 minutes
for questions.
Mr. Duarte. Well, perfect. I am going to pick up where Mr.
Burchett left off.
Hope I pronounced your name right, Tim.
I represent a low-income district in California, a rural
district in California with farmers, and I am very suspect of
the social equity claims made by the electric vehicle industry,
criticizing, as you did, oil production, where it is from. We
have some of the tightest labor markets, some of the best
workforce opportunities in America for drilling of carbon fuels
and delivery of carbon fuels today. It is undeniable. We have
got plenty of work we could expand here and quit bringing in
carbon fuels from around the globe where their environmental
standards and workforce standards are much lower. But that is
not the lowest we can talk about.
The absolute human tragedy happening in the Congo right now
as we speak, mining cobalt mainly, in slave labor conditions,
child slavery conditions, forced slavery conditions, by mainly
Chinese firms, we can say, because that is where all the
batteries are made, and that is mainly who is operating over
there. But you and I both know, we all know, this is proxy
imperialism. This is America's political appetite being served
through an imperialistic group in China, going in, grabbing the
cobalt through slave labor, running it through probably slave
labor factories in China, and selling us batteries that our
Federal Government is subsidizing to serve--yes, we want to
talk about low-income households. They are not buying the
electric vehicles.
Electric vehicles are being purchased by rich people, by
high-income individuals here in America. If they were truly
economic, I think that our working families would have enough
common sense to buy them. They are not.
Tesla is selling vehicles. And just last year alone, they
just reported $1.78 billion in EV credits they sold to their
competitors that produced a lot of gas vehicles that lower
income families want to buy.
So, we have serious fair trade issues. We have serious
economic equity issues with the forced expansion of the
electric vehicle industry. And I don't even need to talk about
the logistic difficulty/impossibilities of meeting these EV
mandates. And we are also talking railroads, don't forget. I
mean, so, this gets more ludicrous as we unravel it.
Mr. Nigro, am I wrong on this? Do we or do we not have
forced slavery in Congo supplying this? Is this or is this not
proxy imperialism through China? Do we not have slave labor
embedded in every electric vehicle sold in America today that
is subsidized by the Federal Government?
Mr. Nigro. So, I have already mentioned the sort of context
issues. So, let me just sort of pick up where you have left off
here on the issue around batteries and critical minerals and
dependency on countries who arguably do not share our values.
You brought up Tesla. So, they have been working with
Panasonic. They have reduced the cobalt use in their batteries
by 60 percent. And they actually have now a battery that is in
many of their offerings from lithium-ion phosphate batteries
that actually have no cobalt at all----
Mr. Duarte [interrupting]. So, slave labor is OK for now
because we might get past that later. Haven't we made that
argument somewhere in our history?
Mr. Nigro. In a nutshell, it is like so many problems we
face in transportation: This is about trying to innovate our
way out of it. And the industry itself has set up an initiative
called the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance----
Mr. Duarte [interrupting]. Do you have any faith that that
is taking place in preventing slave labor-derived elements in
the Congo from reaching American markets and consumers with
Federal subsidies?
Mr. Nigro. I think when it comes to resource extraction in
general, it is about accountability and shining a light on
these issues and making sure we set up a policy framework----
Mr. Duarte [interrupting]. Do those exist? We have been at
this for a while. Do those accountability mechanisms exist?
Mr. Nigro. You are----
Mr. Duarte [interrupting]. Yes, I am asking you. You're
saying what we should do and what we might do, what the future
might hold, but I am not hearing that we are holding ourselves
to any humane standard whatso---I mean, we are in a country
here that literally cares how a chicken lays an egg and how
many piggies go in the pigpen so that people can buy pork and
buy eggs, but we are subsidizing slave labor in foreign
countries through proxy imperialism, with our geopolitical
enemies, to force consumers to buy electric vehicles. This is
ridiculous, isn't it?
Mr. Nigro. I will just say a couple points here. This
Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance is recently joined
General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Tesla, Rivian. This
initiative had been around for almost 20 years----
Mr. Duarte [interrupting]. It is failing.
Mr. Nigro. Automakers are now joining because they want to
bring that accountability.
Mr. Duarte. The Federal Government hasn't required any kind
of fair trade. See, I am dropping tomorrow--I am dropping the
EV Fair Trade Act, which simply says, if you want to get a
Federal check to subsidize your electric vehicle purchase,
that's fine--I am sure you will look cute in it--it's going to
be certified by the manufacturer not to involve constituents or
components derived from slave labor.
Do you see the morality in that, or would you like us to
ding dong along with these initiatives longer?
Mr. Nigro. I am not sure of the details of this
legislation, so, I can't really comment on it.
Mr. Duarte. Thank you. I yield back.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you. The gentleman yields back.
And I recognize myself for 5 minutes for questions.
[Discussion off the record.]
Ms. Maloy. All right. I am going to take my 5 minutes.
Mr. Darakos, I want to go to you. I am concerned about the
trucking industry and being able to move goods. I represent the
Second Congressional District in Utah. We have two major
freeways. A lot of goods move through my district. And I spend
a lot of time driving. I have a very large district. I spend a
lot of time at places like Love's and Maverik gas stations. And
I know that trucks are only making money when they are moving.
Do you know how long it takes a medium-duty truck to
charge?
Mr. Darakos. Thank you for that question. It depends. And
by that I mean it depends on the charge rate of the vehicle,
what it will accept. And it also depends on the charging rate
of the charging infrastructure, the hardware. So, in my
experience, we put in two 75-kilowatt dc fast chargers 3 years
ago. That was fast, relatively fast. For our medium-duty
trucks, it takes a couple hours to charge.
Our new electrification project that we are putting in in
Harrisburg, we are putting in a 600-kilowatt charging cabinet.
The vehicles now can charge at 250 kilowatts, but it takes
time.
My biggest concern is parking and having access to charge
over the road, because it is a significant challenge and
problem. And then also, when you look at the hours-of-service
rules, I can't imagine what a driver is going to go through.
There are 10 chargers at a site, they are pulling in the
charge, and sometime during their rest area, they have to wake
up and move their rig to allow someone else on. But it is
improving, but it can be a challenge that is going to impact
operations today.
Ms. Maloy. OK. I had four questions to ask you about that,
and you answered all of them in that answer. That was very
impressive. Thank you.
And before I wrap up, I just want to say thank you all for
being here. I did this once. I came and testified in front of
Congress way before I ever planned on running for Congress or
knew I would ever sit on this side, and I know it takes a lot
of preparation. And you guys have been sitting here answering
questions for a long time. So, thank you for your preparation.
Thank you for being here.
My friend, Mr. Ezell, talked about good old American know-
how, and I agree with him, but I feel like in the conversation
we are having, we are sort of talking around good old American
know-how and ignoring some realities.
One of my favorite movies is ``Top Gun,'' the original one,
the 1986 one. And there is a line in there, he says, Your body
is writing egos--or ``Your ego is writing checks your body
can't cash.'' And I am afraid what we are doing here is our
goals and our policies are writing a future that our
infrastructure can't live up to.
And I just want to finish with the same question for all of
you. We will start with Ms. Okafor. Actually, let's start with
Mr. Nigro and move the other way.
Mr. Nigro, can we actually meet the goals this
administration has for electrification? Do we have the
infrastructure, the capacity? Is it a realistic goal?
Mr. Nigro. I am an eternal optimist, so, that is not a fair
question.
Ms. Maloy. Go ahead and answer.
Mr. Nigro. But, yes, I 100 percent believe that the
engineering and capacity in this country and the know-how that
we have with our businesses, with folks in the policy
community, can come together and do this, yes.
Ms. Maloy. In the timelines that we have set?
Mr. Nigro. Yes.
Ms. Maloy. OK. Mr. Darakos.
Mr. Darakos. I am an optimist, but I think I am trying to
be a realist as we move forward. And I think there are going to
be some significant headwinds as we move forward. I think there
is a lot of energy. There are a lot of great organizations and
people that are trying to move this forward, but it is heavy
lifting. And it is a challenge, and not everyone has the
resources to move it forward, especially for small businesses
and smaller organizations.
Ms. Maloy. Mr. Coggin.
Mr. Coggin. I think to meet the goal of 50 percent emission
reductions by 2030 is attainable very much so to get to zero
emission by 2050. With current technology and current funding,
I think it is going to be a really heavy lift.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you.
Ms. Okafor.
Mrs. Okafor. Absolutely. If I may, I did want to address
the question that you asked earlier regarding the amount of
power needed to charge a truck to--if we were----
Ms. Maloy [interrupting]. Do it quickly. I am almost out of
time.
Mrs. Okafor. Very quickly. At a typical truckstop, you have
8 to 10 lanes to fuel a heavy-duty truck. In order to do that
with an electric truck, you will need to put in megawatt
chargers. You would need to put in 10 megawatt chargers. That
is more power than the Empire State Building in New York. That
is a significant amount of power in rural America. That would
be extremely challenging.
To answer your question directly, in order to make this
work, it has to be something that the American consumer wants
to buy. If they don't want to buy it, if you don't have the
demand, then you don't have the economic structure that
investors would want to invest in. So, the challenge there is
having both sides do this. We have done it before with the
biodiesel market, having a two-sided incentive structure.
Without that, I think it would be a challenge to get there.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you.
I am concerned that we have these goals, but a goal without
a plan is just a wish, and a wish is not policy.
So, with that, thank you. The gentlelady yields back.
Are there further questions from any members of the
committee who have not been recognized?
Seeing none, that concludes our hearing for today.
I would like to thank each of the witnesses for your
testimony.
The committee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 2:02 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Submissions for the Record

Letter of April 30, 2024, to Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford, Chairman,
and Hon. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on
Highways and Transit, from J. Clark Mica, President, Institute of
Makers of Explosives, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Eric A. ``Rick''
Crawford
April 30, 2024.
The Honorable Rick Crawford,
Chairman,
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, House Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure.
The Honorable Eleanor Holmes Norton,
Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, House Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure.
Dear Chairman Crawford and Ranking Member Holmes Norton,
The Institute of Makers of Explosives (IME) is a trade association
founded in 1913 with the mission to promote the safe and secure
manufacture, transport, distribution and use of commercial explosives.
IME appreciates the subcommittee's attention to the electrification of
fleet vehicles through its hearing ``It's Electric: A Review of Fleet
Electrification Efforts.'' As you conduct your review, we would like to
bring to your attention our unique concerns with the shipping of
commercial explosives on zero-emission (ZEV) vehicles.
Manufacturers of commercial explosives contribute $4 billion
annually to the U.S. economy and employ nearly 10,000 workers in the
U.S. Commercial explosives are essential to energy production,
communications, technology manufacturing, highway and building
construction, the health care delivery system, agriculture and the
production of nearly all metals and mineral products. If you consume
it, explosives make it possible.
The commercial explosives industry relies on all modes of
transportation, including rail, truck, water and air to move our
products safely and securely, not just nationwide but around the world.
IME supports increased, innovative ways to transport explosives but is
concerned with the use of ZEVs to transport those products until it can
be proven safe.
Currently, commercial explosives and the power sources for ZEVs
(including lithium-ion batteries and hydrogen-fuel cells) are believed
to be incompatible and hauling explosives on these vehicles poses a
potentially hazardous scenario. The incompatibility of the two is
documented in U.S. transportation policy, as the U.S. Department of
Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration's ``Lithium Battery Guide for Shippers'' explicitly
states that Class 1 materials cannot be packed in the same outer
packaging with lithium-ion batteries.\1\ Further, the United Nations
Working Party on the Transport of Dangerous Goods has raised concerns
regarding transporting explosives with ZEVs and is currently examining
the feasibility and safety of doing so.\2\

Lithium-Battery-Guide.pdf
\2\ https://unece.org/transport/events/wp15-working-party-
transport-dangerous-goods-109th-session
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to ensure the safe transport of commercial explosives
products, IME would request that fleet vehicles used to transport
Hazard Class 1 Materials and other materials intermediate for blasting
be excluded from any greenhouse gas emission standard mandates until
ZEV technology for transporting commercial explosives is sufficiently
studied and proven to be safe and reliable. In addition, as the
subcommittee examines fleet electrification efforts, IME requests that
PHMSA, or the appropriate agency, study in greater detail the potential
safety hazards created by shipping commercial explosives on ZEVs.
Thank you for considering our views and for your attention to this
important matter. If you have any questions or would like to discuss
further, please contact Julia Bogue, IME's director of government
affairs.
Best Regards,
J. Clark Mica,
President, Institute of Makers of Explosives.

Cc: Subcommittee on Highways and Transit

Statement of the National Association of Small Trucking Companies,
Submitted for the Record by Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
The National Association of Small Trucking Companies (NASTC)
applauds the subcommittee for holding this hearing on the Biden
administration's pie-in-the-sky initiatives pushing all-electrification
of American transportation, including large trucks.
NASTC is a member-based organization whose 15,000 member companies
range from the single-power-unit, owner-operator operating under its
own authority to carriers having more than 100 power units, averaging
12 power units. These companies mostly operate in the long-haul, over-
the-road, full-truckload, for-hire, irregular-route sector of
interstate trucking. NASTC's members come from the largest segment of
America's long-haul trucking: small motor carrier businesses having
fewer than 100 power units.
The recent study by Roland Berger estimates that infrastructure
costs alone for fully switching trucking to electric power would cost
$1 trillion.\1\ That is more than half a trillion for heavy-vehicle
charging infrastructure and nearly half a trillion for bolstering the
electric grid infrastructure. We don't question this research and
analysis, but we do observe that well-founded, good-faith financial
projections made at one point in time tend to underestimate actual
costs, once the funding, planning, permitting, purchasing of supplies,
contracting of labor, etc. are ultimately fulfilled and construction
begins. Here we are talking about multiple projects, each one facing
red tape and delays.

Additionally, projected costs are likely to rise given the adverse
effects of inflation, which persists and has worsened lately. Inflation
since President Biden took office has substantially reduced the
purchasing power of the dollar; the consumer price index has risen
about 20% since January 2021, with prices up sharply for gasoline,
diesel, and groceries. On that basis, the projected cost to switch
trucking to all electric is staggering and likely to significantly
exceed $1 trillion by the time costs come due.
The Biden administration's electric vehicle mandates and subsidies
in the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act are matched by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emissions
rules for light and heavy vehicles.
These initiatives make it clear that the administration's ultimate
goal is the elimination of internal-combustion vehicles.\2\
Regrettably, those driving these changes are using raw government
power--rather than rational, informed, collegial lawmaking--to force
American trucking, consumers, and others to give up the option of
reliable forms of transportation and energy and to hope and pray that
unreliable electric vehicles and power supply will miraculously meet
the need.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This hearing delivers a reality check about electrification of U.S.
transportation and the trucking sector. Extremist, unrealistic policies
must be tempered by acknowledgement of progress already made at
tremendous cost to taxpayers and the private sector. These gains
include the tremendous clean-air strides our transportation industry
has made over the past 40-plus years, such as the implementation of
low-sulfur fuel, the implementation of ultralow-sulfur fuel, the
diminution of idling time through the use of auxiliary power units
(APUs), the implementation of catalytic converters and DEF, and a
myriad of fuel efficiency practices in tires and aerodynamics.
Moreover, Chairman Crawford states it well, and NASTC associates
itself with his opening statement, particularly this, regarding the
gross lack of understanding of the recent legislative and executive
unilateralism exhibited as to the practicalities:

I respect the rights of a company to decide if it's in the
company's best interest to electrify their fleet, just like I
respect their ability to choose to go in another direction,
like natural gas. But it is also important to recognize that
many fleets, including owner-operators, will be put at a
competitive disadvantage and simply can't afford to purchase
new vehicles, let alone a $400,000 rig.

To add to these challenges, the batteries in these trucks can
weigh up to 16,000 pounds, roughly one-quarter of the total
allowable weight. That will make already slim margins for
payload offset even slimmer. Add in the fact that it takes
between 2.9 to 5.7 hours to recharge the battery--that is, if
you can find an open and functioning charger. That's on top of
the current challenge we know exists with the truck parking
shortage. Less product will move on each truck. And each truck
will take longer to get to its destination. This isn't a recipe
for success. (emphasis added)

The Biden administration way is not the American way. The EPA and
other federal agencies are imposing a substantial financial and
regulatory burden on American industry and citizens, and erecting
hurdles to advancements such as building new, cleaner oil refineries
and adequate truck parking. Proposed NOx and greenhouse gas (GHG)
reduction goals and the timetables for achieving them are wildly overly
ambitious, especially in light of the remarkable reductions our
trucking sector has already achieved. Effectively, post-2010 heavy-duty
trucks release cleaner air into the atmosphere than they take in.
If stated government orders are implemented, many carriers and
truckers will opt to keep the vehicle(s) they have for longer than they
otherwise would have. Already, small motor carriers and independent
owner-operators are precluded from the new-truck market by price. New
or used electric vehicles will cost significantly more than do new
diesel trucks.\3\ For the large percentage of carriers having 20 or
fewer trucks, electric vehicles won't be an option for the foreseeable
future. The expensive mandates will cause current vehicles to continue
in use as long as possible. The price differential between older, used
trucks and the more expensive, newer electric models, once on the used
vehicle market, will be key factors in small carriers' purchasing
decisions. The government-caused slower turnover of older commercial
trucks and slower uptake of expensive EV models replacing diesel-
powered ones through the used-vehicle market, coupled with predictably
higher used truck purchase prices and slimmer profit margins, will
translate into less reduction of NOx and GHG levels in the atmosphere.
The projected health and environmental gains EPA and the White House
proffer will not be achieved.

Meanwhile, private vehicles provide a cautionary tale that should
be learned both for autos and commercial vehicles. American consumers
are voting with their auto choices.\4\ In the car, pickup, and SUV
markets, less than 8% of last year's U.S. vehicle sales were EVs; more
than 90% of 2023 autos sold were gas-powered or hybrid vehicles.\5\
Auto dealers have stocks of EVs crowding the lot--middle-class
consumers aren't buying them. Auto companies lose money on EVs.

Consumers reject EVs for a number of good reasons. EVs are not
dependable. Consumers experience about 80% more problems with EVs than
with autos run by internal-combustion engines, Consumer Reports
found.\6\ Consumers complain that electronic features stop working.
Batteries die faster in cold weather and sometimes won't charge. The
advertised mileage on an engine charge is often quite shorter in
reality. EVs are expensive, even when government-subsidized. Charging
batteries costs more than a tank of gas and is much slower. EV
maintenance and repairs cost more. For instance, car EV batteries last
5-10 years, costing $5,000 to $15,000 to replace.\7\ Resale value is
uncertain. (Perhaps the EV makers could develop an aftermarket for
scrapped EVs' batteries to equip consumers' homes with sufficient
electricity generation.)

Furthermore, EVs pose significant hurdles for lower-income people
(as well as certain better-off city dwellers), who live in homes
without a garage, a driveway, or dedicated or reserved street parking,
including apartments or condominiums. Policies to deprive people living
in these circumstances, poor or otherwise, of convenient, affordable
internal-combustion-auto transportation will face the harshest
consequences of an EV hegemony that has outlawed gasoline-powered
vehicles.\8\

EVs hog an unfair share of electricity and burden electric
infrastructure, risking energy security and reliability while markedly
increasing energy consumption.\10\ EVs compete for electricity with
cryptomining, booming artificial intelligence, and other significant
draws on the electrical grid. Meanwhile, the Biden administration's
heavy-handed forced closure of functioning power generator stations
puts the United States at heightened risk of electricity demand quickly
overwhelming supply. This manmade, self-imposed crisis is entirely
avoidable and unnecessary. Yet, here we are.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is serious competitiveness and security risk attached to the
electric-or-bust political agenda. Mining minerals for and
manufacturing EV batteries cause substantial particulate emissions, and
come predominately from rival China or Chinese industry. Further, China
continues to use Diesel 2, the precatalytic converter-grade diesel fuel
that has long been in disuse in the United States. The current,
cleaner-grade diesel fuel used in the United States costs trucking
roughly $1 more per gallon than would Diesel 2. Of course, U.S. diesel
fuel today is better for the environment. But at this point, it is
merely by nominal degrees of ``cleaner'' air rather than earlier gains
already achieved. Presumably, our country's citizens regard the more
expensive U.S. diesel fuel and the costs it adds to their cost of
living worth the extra money. Yet, China benefits economically from its
use of cheaper, dirtier diesel fuel. Still, the Biden administration
and many in Congress continue to push unilateral disarmament, forcibly
denying continued usage of readily available, abundant, U.S. fuel
resources.
Congress should reject exorbitantly costly, unrealistic mandates to
replace fossil fuels and to force foreclosing nearly every other fuel
source except for unreliable ``green'' ones--all driven by government
diktat rather than free-market forces and democratic means. The
subsidies for EV, wind, solar, and battery solutions to our energy
crunch have suffered documented failures.\11\ ``Green New Deals'' and
government largesse for electrification and corporate welfare have not
and won't take the place of a free market-based, forward-thinking,
ecofriendly evolution into using all power sources to get the job
done.\12\ In fact, the supposed green goals are pipe dreams: ``[T]he
vehicles you and I drive, while large in number, sit parked 95% of the
time and play a minor role in U.S. transportation emissions. It elides
the fact that U.S. transportation emissions themselves are a small and
shrinking share of global emissions.''\13\

Attempts to force U.S. economic sectors such as trucking into
manipulated electrification risk sparking a debilitating crisis of
wholesale electricity shortages, unreliable private and commercial
transportation, and countless EVs without charge sufficient to
function. That outcome would spell national crisis in the most
unwelcome way. That is the path the current administration has
recklessly set the country on. America can do better. This hearing
marks a beginning.

Statement of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association,
Submitted for the Record by Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
Dear Chair Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, Chair Crawford, Ranking
Member Holmes Norton, and members of the Committee:
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (``NEMA'') is the
largest trade association of electrical equipment manufacturers in the
nation, representing nearly 325 member companies and 370,000 American
manufacturing workers across all 50 states. Together, our industries
are responsible for 1.65 million American jobs which contribute more
than $200 billion to the U.S. economy. Our members include
manufacturers of electric vehicle (EV) charger stations and the
electrical equipment needed to support public and private charging
stations.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (``BIL'') provided critical
funding to fuel much needed investments into EVs and EV charging
infrastructure. In addition, the bill made it clear that federal
funding can cover the costs of the grid equipment that is needed when
installing charging stations.
An important goal of the legislation is to drive new private
investments in U.S. based manufacturing. Our members share this goal of
fostering and strengthening our domestic manufacturing and supply chain
capabilities for EV charging equipment via responsible right shoring
techniques such as phasing in requirements, allowing for substantial
transformation, and providing clear rules governing these requirements
across all funding programs.
We would remind the Subcommittee that it takes time to build new
manufacturing facilities: our members have already announced several
new plants, have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new U.S.
manufacturing and are planning additional investments in the future.
Nevertheless, compliance with the Build America, Buy America (BABA)
regulations set forth in the BIL does complicate and hinder
manufacturers' ability to quickly and efficiently deploy EV charging
infrastructure under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure
(NEVI) program due to the vague and opaque nature of the Made In
America Office's (MIAO) BABA guidance. Despite the significant
investment by NEMA members in domestic manufacturing capabilities, EV
charging infrastructure relies on a complicated global supply chain
that does not easily adhere to cumbersome one-size-fits-all domestic
content requirements. NEMA has provided detailed feedback to the MIAO
on how the BABA guidance could be structured to enhance and strengthen
domestic manufacturing of EV charging infrastructure.
NEMA BABA Recommendations:
1.  Congress should themselves or ask MIAO to designate countries
from which materials and components can be procured and waive the
component test for products substantially transformed in one of these
acceptable countries or the U.S.; similar to the established Trade
Agreements Act rules for federal procurement. The following countries
should be included in this group:
a.  USMCA countries
b.  European Union member states
c.  The United Kingdom
d.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework countries
2.  Congress should or ask MIAO to establish consistent criteria
and definitions for domestic products across all agencies, programs,
and funding methods.
a.  Further, the administration should provide guidance on
these criteria and definitions to implementing state agencies.
3.  Congress should ask MIAO to ensure the component test includes
all costs associated with the manufacturing of a product, such as
labor, transportation, allocable overhead, and material.

As the Committee considers the progress made by the industry thus
far, we would like to provide some key thoughts as it relates to future
and ongoing efforts of fleet electrification in the U.S.
1.  NEMA recommends that EV charging infrastructure should be based
on standardization and interoperability. NEMA is strongly in favor of
efforts to develop and sustain a nationwide EV charging infrastructure
as part of global efforts to reduce emissions through electrification
of the North American regional transportation system. This deployment
should strive towards standardization and interoperability and allow
for enhanced communication and coordination between the vehicle, the
charging station, and the grid to maximize the benefit and convenience
for vehicle owners while not overly stressing the grid. Standardization
and interoperability will create a more stable environment for
innovation, accelerate infrastructure rollout, and lead to faster
consumer adoption.

2.  NEMA recommends that all publicly funded public charging
locations should be interoperable with all electric vehicles. For a
charging system to energize a vehicle's battery, there must be a common
physical connection point and ``handshake'' between the vehicle's
Battery Management System (``BMS'') and the charger. The BMS will need
to communicate important parameters of the battery to the charger, such
as state of charge, power capability, environmental conditions, and
other data that are critical to safety, battery longevity, and
commercial interoperability. The connection and communication between a
vehicle and charger should be based on a common protocol and a language
fluency that creates a seamless charging experience for all vehicles
and all users.

3.  NEMA recommends that the Federal Highway Administration
(``FHWA'') be flexible in its approach to determining appropriate
performance-based standards for connectors on EV chargers. NEMA
recognizes that in the market there are different standard protocols
for interoperability between the vehicle and the charger. These include
CHAdeMO, Combined Charging System (``CCS1''), and NACS. Another
technology which is anticipated soon is the Megawatt Charging System
(``MCS''). These are each supported by their respective connector that
converts power from the charger before storing it in the vehicle's
battery. AC Charging relies on the onboard charger in the vehicle to
convert the AC power to DC where DC fast charging involves converting
AC power to DC at the charging station before it flows into the
vehicle. Specifying one type of connector over another could cause
unnecessary confusion across the EV charging ecosystem. The NEVI
program sets a good foundational set of minimum requirements for Public
Charging Infrastructure. EV charging equipment manufacturers are then
free to innovate off these requirements thereby further spurring market
competition. As more and more of these get deployed across the country
the market ultimately will decide on how these standards evolve.
Therefore, NEMA would be supportive of removing the current requirement
in the minimum standards for a minimum of four CCS connectors in favor
of a technology neutral approach that enables the opportunity to deploy
CCS or J3400 connectors for DC fast charging systems deployed under the
program.

Dear Chairman Crawford and Ranking Member Holmes Norton,
Powering America's Commercial Transportation (``PACT'') writes to
thank you for holding the hearing titled: It's Electric: A Review of
Fleet Electrification Efforts. PACT's mission is to accelerate the
development and deployment of reliable nationwide charging
infrastructure for medium- and heavy-duty zero emission vehicles. (``M/
HD ZEVs'') \1\. Our membership is comprised of stakeholders across the
transportation electrification ecosystem, including leading truck
manufacturers, charging infrastructure technology providers and
developers, commercial fleets and fleet management companies, and
utilities. PACT is committed to promoting productive cross-sector
collaboration to advance policies and regulations that improve access
to and reduce barriers for M/HD charging infrastructure. PACT members
are committed to the transition to a zero-emission M/HD sector and
ensuring U.S. leadership in ZEV technology deployment. We are
optimistic about the future of M/HD ZEVs, and are dedicated to
converting policy goals into actionable policy solutions. We welcome
the opportunity to collaborate with the Committee and its members on
this important topic.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The medium- and heavy-duty trucking industry is at a crossroads:
State and Federal regulations have placed stringent timelines on the
transition to M/HD ZEVs, but the necessary refueling infrastructure is
not yet in place. PACT was formed to help all stakeholders meet these
ambitious goals through the accelerated deployment of M/HD ZEV
infrastructure.
Transitioning M/HD vehicles to zero emissions is a solvable
challenge. To comply with state and federal regulations such as
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles--Phase 3 \2\
California's Advanced Clean Trucks (``ACT'') and Advanced Clean Fleets
(``ACF''), and other states planning to adopt the ACT and ACF rules,
additional planning and incentives are required for M/HD ZEV
infrastructure deployment. Detailed below is an outline of the barriers
and solutions to the deployment of M/HD ZEV infrastructure. The
examples provided are not exhaustive, but a starting point to address
the primary challenges.

Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles--Phase 3 (Issued March 29,
2024).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barriers & Solutions to M/HD ZEV Infrastructure Deployment
Barrier--Costs: Electrifying M/HD fleets is expensive, imposing
significant costs on customers and all project stakeholders. Current
incentive programs are insufficient to bridge the gap and have long
lead times for cost recovery. Commercial fleets need to consider all
costs when transitioning to ZEVs, including the cost of vehicles, ZEV
infrastructure, and fuel. Additional incentives for fuel and
infrastructure can offset these costs, however the amount of funding
for M/HD ZEVs and charging infrastructure is inadequate. Sufficient
incentives can help to tip the cost balance and build a business case
for M/HD ZEV investment.
There is little dedicated federal funding for M/HD ZEV
infrastructure despite the high cost and unique nature of M/HD ZEV
fleet deployments. State incentives are available in some states, like
California and Washington, but are isolated and insufficient to cover
the costs associated with the transition. Even where incentive programs
exist, the long lead time for reimbursement impedes subsequent
investments.
Solution--Robust Funding Programs: Incentives for M/HD ZEVs and
charging infrastructure will play a critical role in supporting the
energy transition in trucking. Carve outs in existing programs for LD
vehicles will not be sufficient. Instead, the transition to zero-
emission trucking needs dedicated funding streams. For example, while
the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure (``CFI'') program funds some M/
HD infrastructure projects, the funding through the CFI program will
not be sufficient to seed the initial investment that leads to
scalability. Similarly, while NEVI is eligible to be used on M/HD
infrastructure, implementation of the program has led to the vast
majority of funds being used for light-duty charging exclusively.
Federal funds could also be used to modernize the electrical grid to
prepare for M/HD charging.
Barrier--Long Project Timelines: Fleet operators that are confident
in their decision to purchase M/HD ZEVs face challenges when it comes
to site readiness, including the examples below. An OEM is typically
able to deliver vehicles within a year of their being ordered, but
customers cannot count on the availability of necessary infrastructure
or power supply to charge purchased vehicles--it can take 12-36 months
to install and energize infrastructure. Every M/HD site has different
challenges, including site design, available power and necessary
upgrades, among other factors. Additionally, entities must navigate
complex application processes and permitting regulations in order to
receive approval for a project.
Solution--Expediting EV Infrastructure Projects: State and local
governments should create model permitting policies and establish
mandatory deadlines for permitting approvals for M/HD ZEV
infrastructure. The Federal government can also play a convening and
facilitating role among states to align policies.
Barrier--Limited Understanding of M/HD Industry: Charging M/HD ZEVs
is very different from charging light-duty (``LD'') ZEVs. M/HD charging
requirements depend on the fleet duty cycles and route choices, and
require direct current instead of alternating current that is typically
used for LD home charging. This key difference results in a long
process of customer engagement with power companies. Additionally, it
is difficult--sometimes impossible--to upgrade sites designed for LD
vehicles to accommodate M/HD charging because M/HD vehicles typically
require: (1) larger parking spaces; (2) pull through charging; and (3)
significantly more power per charger. U.S. agencies should provide
technical assistance and model programmatic language that supports new
programs for M/HD needs in the national charging infrastructure
network.
Solution--Increased Collaboration: Fleets and utilities should
increase their collaboration to speed the buildout of M/HD ZEV
projects. For example, fleets and utilities should be open to phasing
in power as it becomes available.
PACT looks forward to working with the Committee to advance the
deployment of M/HD ZEV infrastructure.
Sincerely,
Ariel Wolf,
General Counsel, PACT.

Letter of May 7, 2024, to Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford, Chairman, and
Hon. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Highways
and Transit, from Matthew Brownlee, Director, Federal Government
Affairs, The Transport Project, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Eric
A. ``Rick'' Crawford
May 7, 2024.
Hon. Rick Crawford, Chair,
Hon. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Ranking Member,
U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, 2165 Rayburn House Office
Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman Crawford and Ranking Member Holmes Norton:
I am submitting the following comments on behalf of The Transport
Project (formerly known as NGVAmerica) in regards to the Subcommittee
on Highways and Transit hearing on April 30, 2024, titled ``It's
Electric: A Review of Fleet Electrification Efforts.'' The Transport
Project is a national coalition of roughly 200 fleets, vehicle and
engine manufacturers and dealers, servicers and suppliers, and fuel
producers and providers dedicated to the decarbonization of North
America's transportation sector. Through the increased use of gaseous
motor fuels including renewable natural gas and hydrogen, the United
States and Canada can help achieve ambitious climate goals and greatly
improve air quality safely, reliably, and effectively without delay and
without compromising existing commercial business operations.
The transportation sector makes up the largest portion of
greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, and thus we have a great
opportunity to reduce emissions. Over the last thirty years, compressed
natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) vehicles and more
recently renewable natural gas (RNG) vehicles, have made significant
achievements in reducing emissions. These technologies can offer
impactful benefits in our urgent quest for cleaner transportation
solutions.
As the Committee considers the future of fleet electrification, I
urge you to recognize and integrate RNG, LNG, and CNG vehicles into
your framework of sustainable transportation initiatives. The committee
also should consider and support hydrogen fueled vehicles including
hydrogen fueled internal combustion engines (ICEs), which will soon be
entering the market and offer significant emission reduction benefits.
The statement and testimony offered by Kim Okafor, General Manager
for Zero Emissions at Love's Travel Stop and Trillium Energy Solutions,
on behalf of NATSO underscored the very real challenges and high cost
of electrifying portions of the transportation sector. Additionally, we
agree with the statement and testimony of Taki Darakos, Vice President,
Vehicle Maintenance and Fleet Service at PITT OHIO on behalf of the
American Trucking Association, regarding the recent EPA GHG3 rule.
There is a need for broad, pragmatic, and achievable emissions
standards that truly foster the adoption of lower-carbon technologies.
The shift to unrealistic targets by 2030 could indeed stifle innovation
and investment in proven, scalable solutions like RNG that are
available today and deliver immediate emissions reductions.
It is widely acknowledged that no single solution will meet our
clean transportation needs, especially across different vehicle classes
and use cases. Electric vehicles can be vital to our energy transition,
but it should not be done at the expense of the investment that has
already been made into other alternative fuel vehicles. Gaseous fueled
vehicles present a ready and effective technology solution, which is
particularly advantageous for heavy-duty transportation where
electrification faces challenges due to range, payload capacities, and
infrastructure needs.
Renewable natural gas, or biogas, is gas produced from methane
emitted through the decomposition of animal manure, food waste, forest
management waste, wastewater sludge, and garbage. This methane, if left
alone is a potent greenhouse gas. However, capturing and processing
methane for use as a transportation fuel, turns a problematic waste
liability into a sustainable energy resource.
As a result, RNG is the only carbon negative motor fuel and its use
provides significant greenhouse gas reductions. Last year the bio-CNG
mix in California held an annual average carbon intensity score of -
126.42 gCO2e/MJ, the lowest average carbon intensity of any fuel option
in the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard program today. This presents
a great opportunity for RNG's potential to meet and surpass emission
reduction targets in transportation.
The prevalence of RNG is expanding. Last year alone, 79 percent of
CNG used for on road transportation came from a renewable source.\1\ In
the U.S. there are 338 operational RNG facilities with 165 under
construction and 324 in development. We have seen more and more fleets
opt for natural gas vehicles as a way to reduce their carbon footprint.
The nation's largest fleet, UPS, has over 18,000 alternative fuel
vehicles and they continue to expand their roster of CNG and LNG
vehicles. UPS aims to cut its carbon emissions per package delivered by
50 percent by 2035.\2\

RNG-Decarbonize-2024.pdf
\2\ https://tanktransport.com/2024/04/ups-cng-trucks-acquisition/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Natural gas vehicles are not only available now but are mature
technologies supported by a well-established fueling network of
stations coast-to-coast. They offer lower total cost of ownership and
are especially effective in applications where vehicles return to base
for refueling--ideal for buses, refuse trucks, and short-haul
logistics.
Cities like Los Angeles and New York have successfully integrated
RNG into their public transit systems, demonstrating substantial
reductions in carbon emissions and pollutants. Similarly, major waste
management companies like WM have converted their fleets to RNG,
procuring their RNG from their own landfills. Citing not just
environmental benefits but also economic advantages due to lower fuel
costs compared to diesel.
Electrification is not the only way to decarbonize the
transportation sector. If the goal is to lower emissions dramatically
and allow every fleet of every size and corner of this country to
participate, then multiple clean options must be available.
Gaseous fueled vehicles powered by CNG, LNG and RNG are a
practical, immediate solution that can significantly contribute to our
national goals for cleaner transportation. By integrating these
technologies into the national fleet electrification strategy, we can
take a more inclusive and effective approach to reducing transportation
emissions.
Please feel free to contact The Transport Project for further data,
to engage in discussions, or to participate in hearings to explore this
topic in greater depth. Thank you for considering this crucial aspect
of our transportation future.
Sincerely,
Matthew Brownlee,
Director, Federal Government Affairs, The Transport Project.

Questions from Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford to Taki Darakos, Vice
President of Vehicle Maintenance and Fleet Service, PITT OHIO, on
behalf of the American Trucking Associations

Question 1. Mr. Nigro's written testimony reflected that there were
over 17,000 zero-emission trucks on the road.\1\ In contrast, your
written testimony suggests that there are very limited numbers of
battery-electric trucks available to purchase and deployed on our roads

testimonies? For example, what is the vehicle class breakdown of zero
emission trucks registered today on our roads? Please provide any
additional details on the differences and uses of these various trucks.

Answer. The figures referenced in Mr. Nigro's testimony are sourced
from CALSTART's January 2024 State of the U.S. Market Report and
reflect deployment primarily of cargo vans rather than the heavy-duty
Class 8 trucks that our economy relies on for long-haul freight. To
highlight this difference, I encourage the Committee to consider the
figures in the following table, which show that over 80% of zero-
emission truck deployments through 2023 were cargo vans.

U.S. Market.'' CALSTART. January 2024.

In addition to CALSTART's data, the California Air Resources Board
(CARB) periodically reports on the distribution of state credits
claimed by heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers. According to CARB's most
recent May 2024 report, manufacturers sold 18,473 zero-emission
vehicles in California, of which only 353 (less than two percent) were
Class 7 and 8 tractors for model year 2023.\3\ Deployment of lighter,
lower-payload cargo vans, and the charging infrastructure to support
them, should not be conflated with the major investments needed in
charging infrastructure for Class 7 and 8 trucks and the technology
advancements required to make those vehicles practical and affordable
for regional and national heavy-duty trucking networks.

Model Year.'' May 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our experience it has only been within the last two years that
the technology has become available in the Class 7 and 8 space. It is
also important to note that the purchase price in the battery-electric
light-duty segment is slightly higher than traditional ICE vehicles.
The price jump for Class 7 and 8 is substantial, ranging from 2.7 to
3.5 times more (excluding charging infrastructure costs) of traditional
ICE vehicles.
Operational costs for battery-electric trucks are also higher,
especially for Class 7 and 8 vehicles. In a recent study published by
the commercial lease and truck rental company Ryder System, Inc., their
fleet experienced total cost of transport increases of 94 to 114
percent for heavy-duty truck conversions and 56 to 67 percent for mix
fleet conversions, compared to a five percent cost increase for light-
duty electric vehicles.\4\

Vehicle Conversion for U.S. Commercial Fleets.'' May 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
National zero-emission heavy-duty vehicle sales are, to my
knowledge, largely driven by grants and demonstration projects through
programs such as California's HVIP program or EPA's current Clean
School Bus program. Setting aside the financial challenges of
purchasing these vehicles, as I mentioned in my testimony, the lack of
adequate charging infrastructure and the performance limitations of
current heavy-duty tractors will also exacerbate the difficulty of
meeting regulatory targets and timelines such as those established by
California's Advanced Clean Fleets program. Meanwhile, programs such as
the EPA's DERA (Diesel Emissions Reduction Act) program, which is
awaiting Congressional reauthorization and merits expansion, continue
to deliver emissions reductions and operational benefits for the
trucking industry by incentivizing the replacement of older diesel
trucks with new, cleaner diesel technology.

Question 2. What weather impacts have you experienced with
performance limitations of the battery-electric trucks that your
company is running in Ohio and Pennsylvania?
Answer. Real-world operational data shows that weather and
topographical conditions can have significant negative impacts on the
usable range of battery-electric vehicles. According to a AAA
Foundation study of the range of electric passenger vehicles, a car
that may be expected to travel 105 miles in 75-degree weather only
travels 69 miles in 95-degree temperatures and 43 miles in 20-degree
temperatures.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PITT OHIO's experience testing battery-electric trucks has shown
similar range reductions in hot and cold temperatures as those seen in
passenger cars. We have seen a 10-15% range reduction over the last two
years of operation. We are not alone among trucking companies in that
we need more time to procure technologies and perform testing over many
miles, and under multiple weather and topographical conditions, in
order to collect data on how a transition to battery-electric trucks or
alternative technologies will impact our operations.

Question 3. How do battery-electric trucks perform in all four
seasons? Are there any route modifications or adjustments that you need
to make due to certain weather conditions?
Answer. As mentioned in my response to the previous question, our
experience has been that battery-electric freight vehicles experience
range reductions in extreme hot and cold temperatures. We are a
regional carrier operating in the mid-Atlantic and midwestern U.S., so
we must be able to maintain our operations despite challenging seasonal
weather conditions.
PITT OHIO has developed internal tools to help with placement of
vehicles. We make contingencies for factors such as weather, terrain
and payload. These tools allow our team to understand routes, payload
and daily operating characteristics to ensure that the vehicles are
placed in situations where they are set up for success from the start.
We factor in vehicle range buffers to ensure our trucks are able to
make it back to their depot and reduce risks of network disruptions.
While the current technology is improving, it cannot replace the
traditional diesel engine in terms of the diversity of duty cycles that
it can support.
When we initially deployed our first battery electric trucks, the
range of our Class 7 battery-electric box trucks was only 150 miles,
and the payload was 8,800 lbs. In comparison, our traditional ICE box
trucks traditionally run approximately 150-200 miles per day and move
up to 15,000 lbs. of payload. In the Class 8 segment, the ability to
shift to a battery-electric truck is limited due to range requirements
for those vehicles in our current network. Those tractors run 150-200
miles per day in a city operation and average 520 miles per day at
night in our linehaul operation. Most of the runs with these heavy-duty
vehicles are on extremely tight schedules. Having to charge for any
period would require a significant investment in additional equipment
and drivers. With a fully battery-electric fleet, we would not be able
to do what we do today.

Question 4. The Roland Berger study entitled, ``Forecasting a
Realistic Electricity Infrastructure Buildout for Medium- & Heavy-Duty
Battery Electric Vehicles'' examined the different types of charging
profiles that commercial vehicles would be required to utilize during
on-route operations.\6\ How will trucking fleets assess depot charging
versus on-route charging needs and what needs to be in place to provide
certainty?

RB%20Study%20Report_
final%5B111225%5D.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. The Roland Berger study highlights the unique charging
ecosystem that will be required to fully electrify the medium- and
heavy-duty trucking industry. Fleets will assess route length, duty
cycles, vehicle range, and the existing charging infrastructure along
their routes to ensure operational performance.
Depot charging is generally well-suited for fleets with predictable
schedules and vehicles returning to a central location daily, such as
Class 3-6 vehicles with local routes under 90 miles, which can be
charged overnight using Level 2 or Level 3 chargers. However, fleets
with longer routes, particularly Class 8 long-haul trucks exceeding 200
miles daily, will require on-route charging due to the current
technological limitations of battery-electric technology.
For PITT OHIO, we continue to have ongoing conversations with
utility partners serving our facilities where trucks can return daily
for depot charging. With operations in multiple states, it is
challenging to work with dozens of utilities and state and local
regulators on charging projects across our network. Wait times can take
years for these projects, and there is a significant cost. Our
experience is likely shared by every other trucking company seeking to
proactively address the challenges of electrification.
Our linehaul operations may rely on on-route charging, and the
potential need for multiple charging stops will significantly impact
operational efficiency, as well as the total cost of ownership and
operation. In short, battery-electric technology does not work for
every operation today. A reliable, dense, geographically dispersed on-
route charging network is an essential precursor before fleets acquire
heavy-duty battery-electric vehicles in high-mileage operations.
Several key elements are needed to provide certainty and encourage
fleet adoption of zero-emission vehicles:

Clear and consistent federal and state policies that
incentivize ZEV purchases by reducing the financial burden of their
higher upfront costs compared to conventional vehicles;

Substantial upgrades to the nation's grid transmission
and distribution networks;

Standardized charging protocols and connectors; and

Reasonable regulatory timelines that enable fleets to
work with utility providers to acquire the electricity necessary to
power their operations and prove that battery-electric truck technology
works for their duty cycle and application.

Question 5. The amount of power on the grid to support
electrification will be tremendous. The American Transportation
Research Institute's 2022 study demonstrated that electrification of
the entire United States vehicle fleet would consume as much as 40
percent of the country's existing electricity generation and require a
14 percent overall increase in energy generation, yet our aging grid
can barely keep up with current demands.\7\ Electrification advocates
point to trucking fleets to charge at night at slower energy demand to
reduce the stress on the grid and provide lower charging financial
rates. Would charging at night cover all of the operational needs for
PITT OHIO?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ Charging Infrastructure Challenges for the U.S. Electric
Vehicle Fleet, American Transportation Research Institute, (Dec. 2022),
available at https://truckingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/
ATRI-Charging-Infrastructure-Challenges-for-the-U.S.-Electric-Vehicle-
Fleet-12-2022.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. Nighttime charging presents a potential solution for
reducing stress on the grid and taking advantage of lower electricity
rates. Still, it is not a panacea for PITT OHIO's operational needs.
This would work to support our box truck fleet. Those trucks sit idle
overnight and could leverage nighttime charging. These box trucks
represent about 40% of our fleet but--it is important to note--amount
to only 18% of our total fleet miles driven. While nighttime charging
offers favorable rates that fleets could integrate into some duty
cycles, not all operations easily fit this model. Many drivers prefer
nighttime driving due to less congested and safer roads, making it
impractical to switch entirely to nighttime charging without affecting
service delivery and customer expectations, as well as driver morale
and retention. It is also important to note that relying on nighttime
charging for interstate trucking will impact the driving experience and
increase congestion for passenger vehicles, transit buses, and the many
other daytime road users who will encounter additional daytime truck
traffic.
Moreover, significant investments in infrastructure are required,
particularly for behind-the-fence charging at depots that would be the
norm for night charging, which poses a challenge for smaller trucking
companies that lack the necessary resources. Notwithstanding the
national shortage of safe truck parking--we currently have one truck
parking spot for every eleven trucks on the road \8\--these are
substantial hurdles even for a large, family-owned organization like
PITT OHIO. Our nighttime line haul deliveries average 520 miles, with
some drivers covering over 600 miles. These deliveries are not feasible
if drivers need to stop for lengthy recharges. The Roland Berger study
highlights the necessity for corridor charging investments,
underscoring that the shift to electrification will impact current
business operations significantly. Although nighttime charging could
alleviate some stress on the grid and reduce costs, this solution
creates its own challenges and cannot meet the complete operational
needs of PITT OHIO and other trucking companies similarly involved in
nighttime line haul operations.

Questions from Hon. Salud O. Carbajal to Nick Nigro, Founder, Atlas
Public Policy

Infrastructure as a Challenge to Fleet Electrification:
Question 1. The White House announced last week a national goal of
transitioning to a zero-emissions freight sector. Powering America's
Commercial Transportation identifies the lack of MHD ZEV infrastructure
as one of the most significant barriers to deployment of zero-emission
emission MHD vehicles.
How can the Federal government accelerate the deployment of MHD ZEV
infrastructure?
Answer. The U.S. federal government can play a crucial role in
accelerating the deployment of charging and refueling infrastructure
for zero-emission commercial vehicles through the following key
actions:
1.  Delivering on the National Freight Corridor Strategy: The
National Freight Corridor Strategy, developed by the Joint Office of
Energy and Transportation in collaboration with the U.S. Department of
Energy, Department of Transportation, and the Environmental Protection
Agency, provides a comprehensive framework for prioritizing investments
and infrastructure deployment along the National Highway Freight
Network. The strategy aims to catalyze public and private investment,
accelerate industry activity, and signal electricity and hydrogen
markets to plan and deploy necessary generation, transmission, and
distribution projects. The federal government can support the execution
of this strategy by:

Aligning federal investments and funding decisions
with the prioritized areas identified in each phase of the strategy.

Providing technical assistance to states, local
governments, and other stakeholders to incorporate the strategy into
their planning and deployment efforts.

Facilitating cross-sector collaboration among
commercial fleets, industry, fuel providers, grid operators,
regulators, and communities to ensure a coordinated approach to
infrastructure deployment.
2.  Creating incentive funding programs: The federal government can
establish targeted incentive funding programs to assist fleets,
utilities, and charging and fuel providers in building and operating
charging and refueling stations for zero-emission commercial vehicles.
These actions may include:

Create dedicated funding programs for commercial
vehicle infrastructure, similar to the existing National Electric
Vehicle Infrastructure program and Charging and Fueling Infrastructure
discretionary grant program, to offset the high upfront costs of
infrastructure installation and upgrades.

Support the greater use of the existing Section 30C
tax incentive for businesses and organizations investing in zero-
emission vehicle infrastructure.

Provide discretionary funds for public-private
partnerships that leverage the expertise and resources of both sectors
in deploying infrastructure.

Provide targeted incentives for small businesses and
disadvantaged communities to ensure equitable access to clean
transportation solutions.

Support for workforce development programs to train
the necessary technicians and professionals for installing, operating,
and maintaining the infrastructure.
3.  Supporting foundational research at national laboratories: The
federal government should continue to support the critical research
being conducted at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Argonne
National Laboratory, and other national laboratories. This research is
essential for advancing zero-emission vehicle technologies, improving
infrastructure efficiency and reliability, and developing innovative
solutions to overcome deployment barriers. Key areas of focus may
include:

Research on high-power charging and rapid hydrogen
refueling technologies for commercial vehicles.

Development of advanced energy management systems and
smart charging solutions to optimize grid integration and support grid
resilience.

Analysis of infrastructure deployment scenarios and
their impact on energy systems, costs, and environmental outcomes.

Collaboration with industry partners to transfer
research findings into real-world applications and accelerate
technology commercialization.

Federal Need for M/HD Electrification Funds:
Question 2. Powering America's Commercial Transportation, a trade
association focused solely on the buildout of zero-emission MHD
infrastructure, notes in their letter to the Committee that due to
unique aspects of medium- and heavy-duty electrification, new programs
and funding streams should be created to support the infrastructure
buildout for these vehicles. The White House, in its recent
announcement of a national goal of transitioning to a zero-emissions
freight sector, announced $1.5 billion to transition MHD vehicles to
zero-emissions.
Do you agree that dedicated funding streams are necessary to make
the Administration's goals a reality?
Answer. Yes, dedicated federal funding streams to support
infrastructure for zero-emission freight vehicles are necessary for
three compelling reasons:
1.  Freight vehicles, such as medium- and heavy-duty trucks, have
significantly different operating characteristics and larger sizes
compared to light-duty passenger vehicles. These differences
necessitate the development of distinct charging and refueling stations
that can accommodate the higher power requirements, longer charging
times, and larger parking spaces needed for commercial vehicles.
Without dedicated funding streams specifically allocated for zero-
emission freight infrastructure projects, there is a risk that
insufficient funding will be directed towards supporting charging
station for commercial vehicles, which could depress zero emission
vehicle adoption.

2.  Freight charging and refueling stations face economic and
operating challenges that are distinct from those encountered by light-
duty passenger vehicles. For example, the higher upfront costs of
installing high-power charging or hydrogen refueling equipment, coupled
with the need for larger land areas and more complex permitting
processes, can create significant financial barriers for freight
infrastructure projects. Moreover, the operating models for freight
charging and refueling stations may differ from those of passenger
vehicle stations, as they need to accommodate the specific requirements
of commercial fleets, such as the need for reliable and convenient
access to charging or refueling along key freight corridors and at
logistics hubs. Dedicated federal funding streams can help address
these unique challenges and ensure the development of a robust and
sustainable infrastructure network for zero-emission freight vehicles.

3.  Freight trucks are the backbone of the U.S. economy,
responsible for transporting goods and materials across the country and
supporting critical supply chains. Creating a robust network of
charging and refueling stations for zero-emission freight vehicles is
not only essential for reducing emissions and improving public health
but also a matter of national security and competitiveness. By
investing in the necessary infrastructure to support the widespread
adoption of zero-emission freight vehicles, the federal government can
help ensure the resilience and reliability of the nation's
transportation system, reduce dependence on sources of energy from
nations who do not share our values, and foster the growth of domestic
clean transportation industries. Moreover, a well-developed charging
and refueling network for zero-emission freight vehicles can enhance
the competitiveness of U.S. businesses by reducing transportation
costs, improving logistics efficiency, and positioning the country as a
leader in sustainable freight transportation.
