SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Economic Development,
Public Buildings, and Emergency Management
FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public
Buildings, and Emergency Management
RE:      LSubcommittee Hearing on ``Ensuring Transparency
in the Federal Government: An Examination of GSA's Site
Selection for the FBI Headquarters''
_______________________________________________________________________

I. PURPOSE

The Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings,
and Emergency Management of the Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure will meet on Tuesday, December 12, 2023, at
10:00 a.m. ET in 2167 of the Rayburn House Office Building to
receive testimony at a hearing entitled, ``Ensuring
Transparency in the Federal Government: An Examination of GSA's
Site Selection for the FBI Headquarters.'' The purpose of the
hearing is to examine the history of the new Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) Headquarters, the site selection process,
and next steps. Participants will include the General Services
Administration (GSA), the FBI, and former GSA Public Buildings
Commissioner, Nina Albert.

II. BACKGROUND

The pursuit for a new FBI Headquarters (HQ) building dates
back more than 15 years, but the current plan can be traced to
2011 with the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW)
Committee adopting a resolution directing GSA to do a building
project survey report on the ``feasibility and need to
construct or acquire a replacement consolidated headquarters
facility to house the FBI in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan
region.'' \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ GSA Capitol Investment Leasing Program Resolution, S. EPW Comm.
(July 13, 2011) (on file with Comm.) [hereinafter GSA Resolution].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The resolution was adopted pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 3315(b),
which authorizes Senate EPW and the House Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I or Committee) to direct
GSA to produce a prospectus for consideration, effectively
allowing the Committees to initiate specific projects.\2\ The
resolution further directed GSA to identify alternative
strategies, including strategies to leverage the value of the
existing FBI HQ's building.\3\ In response, in 2011, both the
FBI and GSA submitted separate proposals for a new FBI HQ.\4\
GSA recommended traditional Federal construction, which would
require access to the full cost of construction upfront.\5\ The
FBI, noting the unlikelihood of a large amount of funds
becoming available, proposed a lease/lease-back arrangement in
which the Federal Government would ground lease land to a
private developer who would build the facility and lease back
to the Federal Government.\6\

\5\ GSA, Report No. BDC-13001, Report of Building Project Survey
Federal Bureau of Investigation Headquarters Consolidation Washington,
DC, Metropolitan Region (Oct. 17, 2011).
\6\ FBI, Federal Bureau of Investigation Headquarters Consolidation
Project Report (Aug. 2011).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The FBI's justification for a new building included that in
2011, just 52 percent of headquarters staff were housed in the
J. Edgar Hoover (JEH) FBI Building with the remainder in 20
leased locations in the National Capital Region, effecting its
mission and operations.\7\ In addition, the JEH Building did
not meet the Interagency Security Committee security
standards.\8\ The FBI argued consolidation would improve its
operations, shrink overall space, and reduce costs by as much
as $44 million per year.\9\ On December 8, 2011, Senate EPW
authorized the FBI's proposal to proceed as a public-private
partnership (lease/lease-back) with certain limitations
including, to the extent possible, requiring the new FBI HQ be
located a certain distance from a Metro rail and 2.5 miles from
the Capital Beltway, the site was not to exceed 55 acres, and
not exceed 2.1 million square feet.\10\ The limitations on
locations, effectively excluded most of the District of
Columbia from being considered.\11\

Stations for New Building Location, (Feb. 12, 2013).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ultimately, GSA, contrary to the FBI's analysis and
recommendation, and Senate EPW's direction, concluded that
traditional Federal construction would be the least expensive
approach at a 2011 present value cost of $1.86 billion and
asserted that the JEH Building value of $610 million at that
time could be used to offset the costs through an exchange or
disposal and proceeded with this option.\12\

GSA and FBI issued a Request for Information (RFI) in
December 2012 which resulted in a procurement strategy
developed in October 2013.\13\ The developed requirements
effectively excluded sites in the District of Columbia from the
original procurement.\14\ The process involved GSA selecting
sites that would meet the FBI requirements completed in 2014
and included sites in Springfield, Virginia; Landover,
Maryland; and Greenbelt, Maryland.\15\ The procurement process
requested developers compete on constructing the FBI HQ on one
or more of the three sites.\16\ Developers could submit
proposals for one or all of the three sites and developers were
to provide offers on the JEH Building to offset costs.\17\
Essentially, the final site would have been selected based on
competition among developers vying to construct the new FBI HQ.

The timeline for the procurement award continued to shift
from the target award date of Summer 2015 to April 2017.\18\ In
2016, GSA submitted a new prospectus to Senate EPW and House
T&I for authorization of $759 million for a new FBI HQ to be
built on one of the three sites to consolidate 13 leased
locations and JEH and accommodate 11,000 personnel and parking
for 6,000 to 8,000 vehicles.\19\ The prospectus only requested
authorization for the amount to be funded through GSA's Federal
Buildings Fund which would be combined with FBI funding and the
value of the JEH exchange.\20\ The prospectus noted the
reduction of the consolidation from 21 sites to 14 was a result
of the FBI taking actions to decrease its footprint.\21\

On May 18, 2016, the Senate EPW Committee authorized $759
million for the FBI headquarters requiring the project to be a
full consolidation and not greater than 2.1 million rentable
square feet.\22\ On December 7, 2016, the T&I Committee
authorized the project but set more direction and limitations
on the project.\23\ Specifically, the Committee authorized $834
million from GSA's Federal Buildings Fund and set an overall
project limit of $2.11 billion to include all funding sources,
except the value of JEH, required the project to be a full
consolidation, and set an expiration date indicating that the
authorization to award would expire two years from the date of
the resolution.\24\ During this same time, both the House and
Senate committees on appropriations expressed concern with
respect to the timeline and the funding strategy for the FBI HQ
project.\25\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In July 2017, GSA announced the cancellation of the
procurement for the new FBI HQ indicating that full funding was
needed to award; however, there remained a $882 million funding
gap.\26\ That same month, the House Committee on Appropriations
directed in its report accompanying the Financial Services and
General Government Appropriations Bill of 2018 that GSA develop
an alternative plan for the consolidation of the FBI HQ within
60 days after enactment of the Act.\27\

A revised consolidation plan was submitted to Congress in
February 2018.\28\ That plan noted action was needed on a new
FBI HQ indicating that JEH is on the path to catastrophic
failure and estimating the cost of inaction to be $84 million
per year.\29\ The revised plan reduced the scope of the FBI HQ
requirements from approximately 11,000 personnel to 8,300
personnel with some functions relocating to Alabama, West
Virginia, and Idaho.\30\ The plan would not move the FBI HQ,
but rather proposed demolishing the existing building and
replacing with new construction at a total cost of $3.3
billion, including swing space costs.\31\

Ultimately, the revised plan was never executed and in the

to select a site from one of three sites previously identified
in Maryland and Virginia for a new consolidated FBI HQ and
directed GSA to conduct detailed consultations with individuals
representing the sites to further consider ``perspectives
related to mission requirements, sustainable siting and equity

III. SITE SELECTION PROCESS

In September 2022, GSA published the Site Selection Plan
for the FBI Suburban Headquarters.\33\ Per the Fiscal Year 2022
Consolidated Appropriations Act, the sites GSA considered in
this site selection plan included: Greenbelt, Maryland;
Landover, Maryland; and Springfield, Virginia.\34\

\34\ Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-103,

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The three proposed sites were evaluated by an eleven-person
panel which included three voting members--two from GSA and one
from the FBI. The remainder of the panel consisted of eight
non-voting technical advisors.\35\ The panel was directed to
consider five criteria when making its site
recommendations.\36\ The five criteria were then weighted (out
of 100 points) by the predetermined multiplier.\37\ After
assessing the criteria, the panel made a recommendation to the
site selection authority (SSA)--the one person empowered to
make the final decision. As outlined in the Site Selection
Plan, the SSA can reject the panel's recommendation.\38\

During the site selection process, GSA amended the Site
Selection Plan twice: first in November 2022 and then again in
July 2023.\39\ The July 2023 amendment was significant because
it changed the weight given to different criterion. Criteria #1
(FBI Mission Requirements) was decreased from 35 to 25 points
and Criteria #2 (Transportation Access) was decreased from 25
to 20 points. Meanwhile, Criteria #4 (Promoting Sustainable
Siting and Advancing Equity) was increased from 15 to 20 points
and Criteria #5 (Cost) was increased from 10 to 20 points. No
changes were made to Criteria #3 (Site Development).\40\

In August 2023, the Site Selection Panel completed its
Recommendation Report which stated that, ``the consensus
recommendation of the panel was that Springfield is the site
most advantageous to the Government.'' \42\ The Recommendation
Report found that the Springfield site best met the needs of
criteria #1, #2, and #3 which accounted for 60 percent of the
weighted criteria points and the Greenbelt location was found
to best meet the needs of criteria #4 and #5.\43\

However, on November 9, 2023, GSA announced that Greenbelt,
Maryland. had been selected as the location for the new FBI HQ,
as ultimately determined by the SSA, Ms. Albert, the GSA Public
Buildings Commissioner at the time.\44\ The newly published
final report found the Greenbelt site best met the needs of
criteria #2, #3, #4, and #5, while the Springfield site only
best met the needs of criteria #1 and was equally advantageous
to the government for criteria #3.\45\

It is important to note that in addition to the announced
Greenbelt campus, GSA is also working to identify a downtown
Washington, DC, location.\46\ According to the GSA this new
location will accommodate 750 to 1,000 FBI employees and ``will
allow for continued FBI accessibility to the Department of
Justice and other key partners, as well as move the FBI out of
the JEH Building, which is at the end of its useful life.''
\47\ The current plan also seems to include the exchange or
disposal of the JEH Building in the arrangement.\48\

FBI CRITICISMS OF SITE SELECTION PROCESS

On September 22, 2023, the FBI submitted a memorandum and
follow-up questions to GSA seeking clarification on the site
selection process.\49\ The FBI was provided two different draft
decision documents and a briefing on the decision, but claims
it received different explanations in all three
occurrences.\50\

Carnahan, Administrator, GSA (Oct. 12, 2023) available at https://

%2010.12.23.pdf.
\50\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In an October 12, 2023, letter to GSA, the FBI cited
additional concerns with Ms. Albert's involvement as the SSA
and former role with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA) and the potential for conflict of interest as
WMATA is the landholder of the Greenbelt site.\51\ GSA
acknowledged the concerns in a November 3, 2023, letter and
directed the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) to conduct a
review of the site selection process, but ultimately informed
the FBI it would continue with the roll-out of the announcement
on November 9, 2023.\52\

IV. CONCLUSION

Pursuant to 40 U.S.C. Sec.  3307, Committee approval for
new GSA Capital Investment and Program prospectuses is required
when the total cost of a exceeds the current threshold of
$3.613 million per year.\53\ Since the 2016 Committee
resolution expired two years after adoption, GSA must submit a
new prospectus for the FBI Headquarters to proceed with the
project.\54\

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SCOTT PERRY OF PENNSYLVANIA,
CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC
BUILDINGS, AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

Mr. Perry. I want to thank our witnesses for being here
today to discuss the site selection process for a new Federal
Bureau of Investigation, or FBI, headquarters building.
At some point, this committee is expected to receive an
official General Services Administration prospectus requesting
our authorization for a new FBI headquarters building. I will
say upfront I am not convinced the FBI needs a brandnew
building. While the world has become more dangerous, the FBI
finds time to investigate parents at school board meetings and
uses its resources to try and silence dissent across the
country. So, I am not on board with the idea that the FBI needs
a shiny new building at the taxpayers' expense.
But what I may agree with the FBI on are the questions
surrounding the current GSA site selection process, a process
that this committee specifically oversees. The process to build
a new FBI headquarters is probably a textbook example of why
big Government and bureaucracy is so bad, inefficient, and
generally ineffective at the end of the day. This whole process
started more than 15 years ago.
I mean, 15 years ago, you think about it. If you are trying
to build a new home for yourself and somebody told you that you
were going to probably have to wait 15 years--and I know I am
not casting aspersions on you two fine gentlemen--but America
looks at that and says, ``What the heck is wrong with you
folks?'' And after 15 years, there hasn't been a shovel in the
ground. And of course, the cost has, as you know, ballooned,
probably out of sight.
Ironically, if it wasn't for the bureaucratic maze and
politics, right now there would already be a new FBI
headquarters in Maryland or Virginia, likely.
Going as far back as 2011, neither the FBI nor Congress
thought it was realistic to rely on appropriated funds for the
project. No one thought Congress would appropriate what grew to
billions of dollars for new construction.
The FBI, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee,
and members of this committee all expressed that if this was
going to get done, it would need to be done as a public-private
partnership, leveraging private financing. But they were all
overruled by whom? Unelected bureaucrats in the executive
branch who just don't like P3s, or public-private partnerships.
So, it came as no great surprise when the GSA canceled the
procurement in 2017 for a lack of funds--more precisely, a
shortfall of over $800 million. But when the Trump
administration attempted to propose a more realistic solution,
including a P3, the Democrats cried foul again and began
investigations into allegations which again halted the project.
Ironically, the current Department of Justice inspector general
found no evidence--no evidence--of any improper considerations
or motives as the Democrats claimed at the time.
So, instead of going back to evaluate the FBI's current
needs, language was slipped into an appropriations bill
directing GSA to select from among three sites evaluated a
decade ago. Again, so efficient, and I am sure right in line
with the FBI's mission and needs. The language went further to
require GSA to consider not just mission requirements, but also
sustainability and equity.
So, here we are today.
To the witnesses, I get what you are doing, what the
appropriations language has directed you to do, or I get that
that's what you are doing. But now there are questions about
the recent site selection process. During the process, GSA
adjusted the weighting of the factors considered, including
increasing the value given to equity and decreasing the value
for mission.
I have got to tell you, as a former member of the U.S.
military, the mission is what drove everything I did: what time
I woke up, how I dressed, how I prepared myself, what I ate.
Every single thing I did was dependent on the mission; all the
other stuff was irrelevant to me, and it should be the same for
the FBI. It should be the same. They have got a very important
job, and they need to remain focused on that. And it's not
their fault in this regard that we have taken their eye off the
prize, we have forced them to do that.
GSA increased the value for cost, but it is not clear what
costs were considered. Ultimately, the Site Selection Authority
selected the Greenbelt, Maryland, site, overruling the panel
that was convened, and there appears to be little explanation
as to why.
So, we convened a panel to do this, and once they came up
with a decision, then it was countermanded, which begs the
question, why even have the panel, if you are just going to
decide otherwise. I hope today we can get some answers as the
committee prepares to review any proposal for the new FBI
headquarters.
Finally, I want to note we wanted to hear from Ms. Albert
about her role in this process. And despite being invited well
in advance, we learned just on Friday she would not appear
before the subcommittee today. So, we will no longer have a
second panel, but we will be sending her a letter to continue
to seek the answers we need and will have to consider other
options available to the subcommittee so that we can hear her
perspective in the future, which will be very important to
getting to the bottom of this issue.

statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DINA TITUS OF NEVADA, RANKING MEMBER,
SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC BUILDINGS, AND
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this
hearing.
Thank you both for coming to help us understand this
process better. I would like to go back over some of the
history, too, that has been mentioned by the chairman, but just
to put a point on it.
In 2011, both the GSA and FBI developed plans for a new,
consolidated, suburban headquarters for the FBI. The plan cited
the need for a new building, defined its requirements, and
recommended the use of a public-private partnership via a
ground-lease leaseback with a private developer. GSA's plan,
also called an 11b report, recommended Federal construction
which would require upfront full appropriations.
By 2017, however, after years of work by the GSA and the
FBI; authorization by this committee and the Senate Committee
on the Environment and Public Works; an extensive environmental
impact study process; a complex request for information and
request for proposal process with the private sector; a
shifting program of requirements; funding strategy revisions;
changes in the leadership of the FBI, the GSA, and the White
House; and multiple requests for funding, all of that, the GSA
canceled the procurement, citing insufficient funding.
In 2018, the Senate required GSA to submit a revised plan
for the project. That plan was also frustrating. Attempting to
justify FBI Director Wray's newfound desire to remain on
Pennsylvania Avenue, the plan claimed that tearing down the
Hoover Building and rebuilding a new facility on the site could
be accomplished for the same cost as building a new suburban
campus, whether that campus was to be in Virginia or in
Maryland.
What the 2018 plan did not acknowledge was that GSA
determined they could build a new building for the same price
because they were going to shrink the workforce, as they
planned on moving more than 2,000 FBI staff to other FBI
facilities around the country. At the time, GSA also avoided
mentioning that a building on Pennsylvania Avenue could not
possibly meet the highest level of security required for
Federal construction, otherwise known as Interagency Security
Committee Level V.
Then the fiscal year 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act
directed GSA to select a site from one of the three that had
been included in GSA's 2017 prospectus. There were two in
Maryland and one in Virginia. That process and the actions of
GSA's site selection officials is what we need to talk about
today, and I am confident that some of our questions about the
process will be resolved after this discussion.
I don't want to wait, however, to examine the structural
weaknesses in the previous FBI headquarters procurement
process, so, hopefully, we can avoid those same mistakes in the
future.
The last time around, I believe GSA obfuscated and evaded.
Questions about funding differences and strategies were never
answered. Details about the market value of the Hoover Building
were never produced. Shortcomings in the 2018 plan were never
acknowledged. And I do believe that some of the GSA staff at
the time were less than truthful to Congress.
At this hearing I will be looking, like the chairman, for
information about GSA's procurement strategy and funding needs.
I want to know how GSA is going to provide the FBI with the
secure, modern facility that it needs, one where hunks of
concrete aren't falling out of the ceiling onto the desks of
employees.
The current Hoover Building is the only Level V Federal
facility in the midst of an urban area. It is a
counterintelligence disaster just waiting to happen and, as
such, is a threat to our national security. We cannot forget
our commitment to providing our law enforcement with the tools
they need to protect all Americans.
So, again, I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank
our witnesses for being here, and I look forward to having some
of these questions addressed.
I yield back.
[Ms. Titus' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Dina Titus, a Representative in Congress
from the State of Nevada, and Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Economic
Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management
Thank you, Chairman Perry, for holding this hearing.

appropriations.
By 2017, however, after years of work by GSA and FBI staff;

process with the private sector; a shifting Program of Requirements;

Level 5.
The FY22 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed GSA to select a
site from one of the three that had been included in GSA's 2017
prospectus: two in Maryland and one in Virginia. That process, and the
actions of GSA's site selection officials, will be discussed today in
detail. I have confidence that questions about the process will be
resolved.
I don't want to wait, however, to examine the structural weaknesses
in the previous FBI HQ procurement process, so we can ensure that
mistakes are not repeated.
The last time around, GSA obfuscated and evaded. Questions about
funding differences and strategies were never answered. Details about
the market value of the Hoover Building were never produced.
Shortcomings in the 2018 plan were never acknowledged, and I do believe
GSA staff, at the time, was untruthful to Congress.
At this hearing. I will be looking for information about GSA's
procurement strategy and funding needs. I want to know how GSA is going
to provide the FBI with the secure, modern facility it needs, one where
hunks of concrete will not be falling on the desks of employees.
The current Hoover Building is the only level 5 Federal facility in
the middle of an urban area. It is a counter-intelligence disaster
waiting to happen and a threat to our national security.
Have we forgotten our commitment to providing our law enforcement
with the tools they need to protect all Americans?
I want to thank our witnesses again for being here and I look
forward to today's discussion.

Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlewoman. The Chair now
recognizes the ranking member of the full committee, Mr.
Larsen, for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair. And thank you
for calling today's hearing to examine the site selection
process for the FBI headquarters, and thanks to our witnesses
for participating.
Commissioner Doomes, let me officially welcome you back to
the subcommittee. I am sure you would be more comfortable over
here than where you are sitting today, but it is always a
pleasure to have former staff testify before us.
GSA, the FBI, and Congress worked together from 2011
through 2018 to put the FBI in a new building that would meet
the FBI's current and future security, space, and operational
requirements. Those efforts to date have failed.
In 2022, Congress directed the GSA to start the process
again by picking one of the three sites identified in the first
procurement. Last month, as we know, GSA selected the site in
Greenbelt, Maryland, but multiple parties have expressed
concern about that decision.
While those concerns are being examined by GSA's inspector
general, it is useful for this committee to understand how and
why the first procurement failed so we can help GSA and the FBI
avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future.
I want to hear from GSA what the agency learned from the
previous failure and what steps are being taken to ensure
success this time around. For instance, is the GSA prepared to
carry out a project of this magnitude?
I also want to hear from GSA and the FBI about their plans
to secure the funding needed to complete the project.
Finally, I would like to know the effect on the FBI's staff
and operational capabilities if a new headquarters building is
not built in the near future. The FBI has an important mission,
and its employees deserve a safe, secure, and functional
workspace.
So, I look forward to discussing how this committee can
help to ensure the FBI has the headquarters it needs today and
in the future.
And with that, I yield back.
[Mr. Larsen of Washington's prepared statement follows:]

Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
Briefly, I would like to take a moment to explain our
lighting system to our witnesses. There are three lights in
front of you. Green means go, yellow means you are running out
of time, and red means to conclude your remarks. And hopefully,
they will keep working. If they don't, we will just be on the
lookout for that, because we had a little issue at the
beginning of the hearing.
I ask unanimous consent that the witnesses' full statements
be included in the record.
Without objection, so ordered.
I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing
remain open until such time as our witnesses have provided
answers to any questions that may be submitted to them in
writing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 days for any additional comments and information
submitted by Members or witnesses included in the record of
today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
As your written testimony has been made part of the record,
the subcommittee asks that each one of our witnesses limit
their oral remarks to 5 minutes.
With that, Mr. Doomes, you are recognized for 5 minutes for
your testimony.

TESTIMONY OF ELLIOT D. DOOMES, COMMISSIONER, PUBLIC BUILDINGS
SERVICE, U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION; AND NICHOLAS
DIMOS, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, FINANCE AND FACILITIES DIVISION,
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

TESTIMONY OF ELLIOT D. DOOMES, COMMISSIONER, PUBLIC BUILDINGS
SERVICE, U.S. GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION

Mr. Doomes. Good morning, Chairman Perry, Ranking Member
Titus, and distinguished members of the subcommittee. My name
is Elliot Doomes, and I am the Commissioner of the Public
Buildings Service at GSA. I am honored to appear before the
subcommittee to discuss GSA's site selection for the FBI
headquarters.
My written testimony goes into detail on the extensive
history of the project, so, in the interest of time, I will
start in 2022, when the search for a suburban headquarters was
restarted in earnest by Congress.
The Fiscal Year 2022 Appropriations Act directed GSA to
expeditiously select a headquarters site from among one of the
three previously identified sites in Virginia and Maryland. In
September 2022, GSA released its site selection plan.
Subsequently, in December 2022, Congress passed the Fiscal
Year 2023 Appropriations Act, which directed GSA to pause its
site selection process and conduct separate consultations with
Maryland and Virginia officials before resuming with the
selection. GSA and FBI held these consultations in March of
2023, and after carefully considering what was shared by both
jurisdictions, GSA released an update to the plan in July 2023.
The updates, made in close collaboration with the FBI,
adjusted weights to reflect new governmentwide directives and
provide better taxpayer value. It also changed the Site
Selection Authority to the PBS Commissioner. Consistent with
GSA's commitment to transparency, the updates to the criteria
and weighting were shared publicly.
Following the release of the updated plan, GSA resumed the
site selection process. Extensive information was compiled
about each site, including information received from both
delegations during the consultation process. The panel, which
was comprised of two GSA employees and one FBI employee,
convened to review the information about the sites and
submitted their report to the Site Selection Authority. With
this report in hand, the authority was then responsible for
``fully evaluating all attributes of the sites, and selecting
the site which is truly most advantageous to the Government,
regardless of the recommendation provided by the panel.'' This
is GSA's typical process.
As explained in detail in the site selection decision, the
Site Selection Authority determined that Greenbelt was the best
option for the FBI and the public. Greenbelt was chosen
because, as outlined in the decision document, Greenbelt
provides the best access to transportation and is the most
transit accessible. It provides the Government with the
greatest project schedule certainty, offers the greatest
opportunity to positively impact the Washington, DC, region,
and has the lowest overall cost to taxpayers of all the three
sites. The decision report is publicly available and details
the authority's analysis and ratings for all criteria for each
site.
Since the site selection announcement, some stakeholders
have raised questions about the process and decision. Let me
clarify those misconceptions with a few facts.
The Site Selection Authority did not inappropriately change
the panel's recommendation. The Site Selection Authority is the
only official charged with making a decision and is charged
with exercising independent judgment. In fact, during the
downselect in 2014, from dozens of potential headquarters sites
down to three finalists, the Site Selection Authority rejected
the site selection's unanimous recommendation to exclude the
Springfield site.
Number two, the Site Selection Authority did not change the
criteria. As is clear in the final agency decision, the Site
Selection Authority operated under the same July 2023 site
selection plan that governed the panel.
Number three, the Site Selection Authority did not make
changes in favor of a specific site. Rather, the Site Selection
Authority carefully followed the plan and documented their
assessments. In those instances where the Site Selection
Authority differed with the panel, the reason for those
differences are fully explained in the decision document.
And number four, GSA conducted the site selection process
in full compliance with all ethical laws, regulations, and
policies. This includes those concerning potential conflicts of
interest. GSA ran a fair and transparent process and followed
the publicly outlined plan. The site selection decision, as
well as the panel's evaluation and recommendation, are all
available on our website. GSA has also released correspondence
between GSA and FBI, including the legal review conducted by
GSA's Office of General Counsel in response to the FBI's
questions.
We took the questions they raised seriously, and we welcome
a review of our processes and our conclusion. We believe the
record reflects that our decisionmaking official made this
determination according to the plan and the process, and in the
best interest of the FBI and the public. Throughout this
project, GSA has acted pursuant to directives enacted into law.
The next step is for GSA to develop and submit a prospectus to
Congress, and we are working with the FBI on that document.
In closing, I want to note that while GSA may disagree with
the FBI about this phase of the process, there is no
disagreement about the need for a new headquarters here in the
Washington region. This is a national security imperative. GSA
remains committed to working with the FBI and this committee on
this important project.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today,
and I look forward to answering your questions.
[Mr. Doomes' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Elliot D. Doomes, Commissioner, Public Buildings
Service, U.S. General Services Administration
Good morning, Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and
distinguished Members of the Subcommittee. My name is Elliot Doomes,
and I am the Commissioner of the Public Buildings Service (``PBS'') at
the U.S. General Services Administration (``GSA''). I appreciate the
Committee's invitation to discuss GSA's site selection for the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (``FBI'') Headquarters suburban campus.
The Need for a New FBI Headquarters
The critical thing that brings us together today is the
increasingly dire need for a new FBI Headquarters facility. The FBI has
continuously occupied the J. Edgar Hoover Building (the ``Hoover
Building'') since 1974. As multiple studies have demonstrated, the U.S.
Government Accountability Office (``GAO'') has reported, and many
members and staff of this Committee have seen firsthand, the Hoover
Building does not fully support the FBI's long-term security, space,
and building condition requirements; is not designed to meet the needs
of today's FBI; is nearing its life-cycle age; and is exhibiting signs
of complete deterioration. As the FBI has said, they need a new
headquarters to achieve significant cost savings and to better support
the agency's mission-critical activities and strategic priorities. The
dispersion of FBI elements across multiple locations in the National
Capital Region (``NCR'') has created significant challenges to
effectively managing the FBI's divisions and offices and impedes the
FBI's ability to rapidly respond to ever changing threats. As GAO has
highlighted, this was true at the start of the process examining the
need for a new FBI building in 2011, and the issues have worsened since
that time.
Project History
The history of the FBI Headquarters Consolidation project is
complex and dates back more than 15 years spanning multiple
Administrations. While the contours of the project have changed over
time, since the beginning, GSA and FBI have been focused on replacing
the aging Hoover Building and delivering a new state-of-the-art
Headquarters that will best serve the FBI and the public for years to
come.
Of most relevance to the current Congressionally-directed site
selection process, I'd like to provide a brief overview of the timeline
starting in January 2013, when GSA issued a Request for Information
(``RFI'') to garner feedback from members of the development community,
local and state jurisdictions, and other interested parties regarding
feasibility, issues, and considerations of a potential exchange
transaction. The 38 responses to the RFI helped to inform GSA's
strategic planning for the project. In November 2013, the RFI was
followed by a Request for Expressions of Interest (``REOI'') for sites
within the region to be used for the development of a new FBI
headquarters. Under the REOI process, GSA and FBI evaluated dozens of
sites across the region against more than a dozen minimum and
additional criteria that the government considered.\1\ In contravention
to the Panel's unanimous recommendation (they recommended excluding
Springfield, VA), the site selection authority at that time identified
three acceptable sites: one in Fairfax County, Virginia (Springfield)
and two in Prince George's County, Maryland (Landover and
Greenbelt).\2\ These sites were identified because they all met the
baseline requirements of the FBI, including being able to accommodate
the size of a new headquarters facility and meet the Government's
unique security requirements, among other items.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Further information can be found online at: https://
www.gsa.gov/system/files?
file=2013%20FBI%20Headquarters%20Site%20Identification%20and%20Evaluatio
n
%20Approving%20Officials%20Decision_Redacted%20%281%29.pdf.
\2\ The 2022 site selection process was designed similarly to the
process from 2013, which was also typical. That is, the process called
for a panel of GSA and FBI officials to provide expert counsel and
advice to GSA's site selection authority, and directed the authority to
make a final decision, irrespective of the recommendations of the
panel.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
These three finalist sites were then included in a two-phase
developer competition process that began at the end of 2014. This
competition included exchanging the Hoover Building for services that
would help defray the overall cost of the project, and allowed for a
developer to submit a proposal for construction on one or more of the
three finalist sites.\3\ In conjunction with the solicitation process,
GSA conducted a full regulatory review, and issued a 2016 Draft
Environmental Impact Statement (``DEIS'') pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act (``NEPA''). Furthermore, at that time, GSA
sought and received Congressional approval of this project strategy
from the Committee on Environment and Public Works and the Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure, and also received some
appropriations (though not enough to make a full award). For a variety
of reasons, on July 11, 2017, GSA issued a public statement announcing
the decision to cancel the procurement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ On December 19, 2014, GSA issued a Phase I Request for
Proposals (``RFP'') seeking an exchange partner to develop, design,
construct, and deliver the new facility. The Phase I RFP process was
used to select a short list of up to five qualified offerors to compete
in the Phase II procurement. In January 2016, GSA issued the Phase II
RFP to the shortlisted offerors, which detailed the requirements of the
new facility and information on the three selected sites.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While this project strategy and process was a number of years back,
there are two important factors that are relevant for today. First,
each of the three sites had been determined to meet the mission needs
of the FBI. And second, there had been exhaustive review and assessment
of all three sites as part of the solicitation process.
Developing the Current Site Selection Process
After the cancellation of the previous solicitation in 2017,
several other options were considered over the intervening years for
the FBI Headquarters. Then, in the Fiscal Year 2022 Consolidated
Appropriations Act (P.L. 117-103), Congress directed GSA to
expeditiously select one of the three previously identified sites for
the FBI Suburban Headquarters: Springfield, VA; Greenbelt, MD; or
Landover, MD. To make a selection, GSA and FBI committed to developing
a fair and transparent process to guide GSA's decision-making. In
September 2022, GSA released an initial site selection plan, which was
created in close collaboration with the FBI, outlining how the process
and criteria by which the agency would determine which of the three
sites would best meet the needs of the FBI and the public. In December
2022, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (P.L.
117-328) which directed GSA to conduct separate consultations with
individuals representing the sites from the State of Maryland and
Commonwealth of Virginia prior to any action by the GSA Site Selection
Panel for the new Federal FBI headquarters. GSA and FBI held these
consultations in March 2023 with the delegations from Maryland and
Virginia. In July 2023, after holding the Congressionally directed
consultations and carefully considering what was shared by each
jurisdiction, GSA released an update to the plan.
Updating the Plan
The updates, contained within Amendment 2 \4\ and made in close
collaboration with the FBI,\5\ incorporated new government-wide
directives and increased the consideration of cost to deliver better
value for taxpayers. They also adjusted the weighting of the criteria
and simplified the scoring methodology. Finally, the Amendment also
changed the Site Selection Authority, shifting it from the PBS Regional
Commissioner to the PBS Commissioner.\6\ This was done as a reflection
of the significance of this decision, as well as the scrutiny GSA
understood that any official would face--regardless of which site was
selected. GSA believed, and still believes, that it was appropriate to
make the agency's top real estate official the site selection authority
for this project.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ The prior amendment to the plan, Amendment 1, was largely
administrative.
\5\ GSA and FBI worked closely together on the changes to the site
selection plan. Per a June 26, 2023 FBI letter to GSA, although the FBI
indicated they preferred the initial site selection plan, they
ultimately shared ``We acknowledge the thoughtful process that GSA
developed to assess the plan, proposed changes to the plan, and justify
those changes--we have seen firsthand the diligence, professionalism,
and expertise that the team at GSA has applied to a difficult and
complex task. In light of that assessment and GSA commitment to these
changes appropriately reflect its best practices, the FBI respectfully
defers to GSA's final judgment on specific percentages.''
\6\ Prior to a final decision by the agency, it is typical for GSA
to redact the name of the specific decision-making official (as well as
all panelists). This is to avoid any attempts at undue influence of the
independent decision-making process. Once a decision has been made, the
identity of the decision-making official is typically available to the
public, while the panelists' names remain redacted.
\7\ Similarly, in the 2013 REOI process, the Site Selection
Authority was the PBS Deputy Commissioner, not the PBS Regional
Commissioner.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall, Amendment 2 was intended to better align with GSA's
principles to create a process that is fair and transparent, is
grounded in the agency's best practices for site selection, and results
in selecting a site that best meets the needs of the FBI and the
American people for years to come. The core of the plan remained the
same, including the five major criteria each site would be evaluated
against:
(1)  FBI Proximity to Mission-Related Locations;
(2)  Transportation Access;
(3)  Site Development Flexibility and Schedule Risk;
(4)  Promoting Sustainable Siting and Advancing Equity; and
(5)  Cost.

It also maintained the FBI's priorities for the new headquarters:
fulfill FBI mission needs; meet the needs of the FBI workforce; and
provide maximum value for taxpayers, relying on GSA's expertise and
best practices in site selection. The Site Selection Plan, which GSA
and FBI worked on jointly, set forth a process for evaluating which
site was the most advantageous to the government on each criteria,
using a color scale to help guide and inform the final site decision.
Furthermore, to promote transparency in how the government would
balance the importance of the criteria, each was weighted. Consistent
with GSA and FBI's commitment to transparency on this project, the
updates were all announced publicly and the plan was made publicly
available.
Executing the Site Selection Process
Following the release of the July 2023 updated Site Selection Plan,
GSA and FBI commenced the site selection process. The first step was
for the project team to compile a significant amount of information
regarding each site, for the use of the Panel and the Site Selection
Authority. In order to move quickly, and recognizing the extensive
evaluation GSA had conducted during the 2013 process, the agency also
leveraged information from the 2016 DEIS. The next step was for the
Panel, comprised of two GSA employees and one FBI employee, to convene
to review the information about the sites and come up with ratings and
recommendations. The Panel then submitted their ratings and
recommendations \8\ to the site selection authority who, under the Site
Selection Plan, had the responsibility and authority to use the
evaluation report developed by the Site Selection Panel to help guide
and inform a final decision as to which property was in the best
interest of the United States. As documented in the Site Selection
Plan, the Site Selection Authority is charged with the responsibility
to ``fully evaluate all attributes of the sites and select the site
which is truly most advantageous to the Government, regardless of the
recommendation provided by the Panel.'' [emphasis added]. This
process--a panel providing recommendations to a final decision-maker to
make a final decision--is common practice for major GSA siting
decisions. It is also part of the process that the decision-maker is
supposed to exercise their independent judgment. As noted earlier, this
was the same process GSA used in the 2013 selection of the three
finalist sites.

Redacted.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Selection
As explained in detail in the Site Selection Decision, the Site
Selection Authority ultimately determined that Greenbelt, MD was the
best option for the FBI and the public because the site:
(1)  Provides the best access to public transportation for FBI
employees and visitors as it is the most transit accessible site due to
its short walking distance to Metro and commuter rail;

(2)  Provides the government the greatest project schedule
certainty due to the fact that the site is owned by a public entity and
offers a clear public process and timeline to achieve site control;

(3)  Offers the greatest opportunity for the government's
investment to positively impact the Washington, D.C. region through
sustainable and equitable development; and

(4)  Has the lowest overall cost to taxpayers of all the three
sites.

In short, consistent with the process, the final decision was made
based on a determination of which site would be best for the FBI and
the public for years to come. The site selection authority's complete
40-page decision fully explains their analysis and ratings for all of
the sites against all of the criteria contained within the plan,
including an explanation of where their judgment differed from the
Panel's. This document is publicly available on GSA's website.\9\

system/files/FBI%20HQ%20Site%20Selection%20Decision.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Correcting Misconceptions
In the days following the announcement of the selection of
Greenbelt, MD, some stakeholders have raised questions about the
process and decision, and GSA welcomes the opportunity to clarify some
misconceptions in the public sphere. Here are some of the most
critical:
1) Misperception: The site selection authority inappropriately
``overturned'' the panel's recommendation
The site selection authority did not ``overturn'' the panel's
recommendation. As outlined above, the panel was tasked with making
recommendations, and the site selection authority was charged with
making the final selection, ``regardless of the recommendation of the
panel.'' Under GSA's site selection process, only the site selection
authority has authority to make a site selection.
2) Misperception: The site selection authority changed the criteria
The site selection authority did not change the criteria. As is
clear in the final agency decision, the site selection authority relied
on the same criteria in making their decision that the Panel relied on
to make their recommendations.
3) Misperception: The site selection authority made arbitrary changes
in favor of a specific site
The site selection authority carefully followed the plan and the
process and did not make any arbitrary changes to favor (or disfavor)
any site. Moreover, as GSA's Office of General Counsel (OGC) review
determined, the record shows that the Panel and the site selection
authority demonstrated substantial agreement on their evaluations of
all three sites; in fact, 9 of the 12 subcriteria ratings were the same
between the Panel and the site selection authority. In those instances
where the site selection authority differed from the Panel's
recommendation, those changes reflect differences in judgment and are
fully explained in the agency's publicly available decision document.
4) Misperception: The site selection authority had a potential conflict
of interest
Any potential conflicts of interest were reviewed and resolved, in
accordance with advice from GSA's OGC, at the time the site selection
authority was appointed PBS Commissioner in July 2021. GSA conducted
the site selection process in full compliance with all ethical laws,
regulations, and policies, which GSA's OGC validated as part of their
review due to stakeholder questions.
Conclusion & Next Steps
GSA ran a fair and transparent process, guided by the agency's best
practices in site selection. At every step, the GSA team worked to
carefully follow the process outlined publicly, and to make a decision
that best meets the needs of the FBI and the public for the long-term.
Consistent with our commitment to transparency, our agency's full site
selection decision, as well as the Panel's evaluation and
recommendation, are all available on our website. Given the questions
that have been raised, GSA took the additional step of releasing the
correspondence between GSA and FBI, which includes the legal review
conducted by GSA's OGC in response to the FBI's questions. GSA has
publicly stated, and I will reiterate, that we welcome a review of our
process and our conclusions. We think the record reflects that our
decision-making official made this determination based on what they
believed was best for the FBI and the public.
GSA plans to continue to closely follow the law and Congressional
directives on this project. Subsequent to Congress directing GSA to
hold consultations and then select a site, the next step Congress
directed is to develop a project fact sheet (known as a prospectus) for
submission to Congress. Developing this will require close
collaboration with the FBI to ensure the new Headquarters meets its
mission needs now and in the future, and we look forward to continuing
to work with them to that end.
GSA's mission, and my primary duty as PBS Commissioner, is to
provide the best value in real estate. Working with partner agencies to
deliver workspaces that allow them to accomplish their missions is what
we do. And despite disagreements some may have around which site was
selected, the need for the FBI to have a functioning, safe, and secure
Headquarters, in order to fulfill their mission, is fundamental. The
work that the FBI is doing to uphold the Constitution and protect the
American people is, at this moment, more important than ever--and GSA
is fully committed to delivering a highly effective Headquarters to
help them deliver on that mission.
GSA looks forward to working with the FBI and this Committee on
this important project. Thank you for the opportunity to testify before
you today. I look forward to answering your questions.

Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks you, Mr. Doomes.
The Chair now recognizes Mr. Dimos for 5 minutes for your
testimony.

TESTIMONY OF NICHOLAS DIMOS, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, FINANCE AND
FACILITIES DIVISION, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Mr. Dimos. Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and
members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to
discuss the new FBI headquarters project with you today.
My name is Nick Dimos, and I am a career employee at the
FBI and serve as the chief financial officer, and I am
responsible for all FBI facilities. I have been the lead FBI
executive coordinating with GSA on the new headquarters plan
for the past couple of years.
The FBI J. Edgar Hoover Building, referred to as JEH, is,
quite frankly, failing. Netting is placed around the perimeter
to prevent falling concrete from hitting pedestrians. Concrete
deterioration is occurring inside the building, as well, with
instances of concrete even falling over employee workspaces and
equipment. Pipe bursts and plumbing challenges are commonplace,
leading to the damage of FBI space, IT, and records. JEH power
and network infrastructure challenges are ever present,
resulting in disruptions to connectivity needed to coordinate
FBI cases nationwide.
From a cost perspective, the Government is currently
spending millions of dollars for expensive commercial leases in
the NCR as the FBI workforce is scattered across multiple
locations beyond JEH. The headquarters plan will consolidate
these sites, and reflects the thousands of positions that the
FBI has already relocated to Huntsville, Alabama, and other
locations outside the national capital region. The current
proposal will allow for a smaller footprint in the NCR,
compared to our request back in 2017.
Now, with the need for a facility so great, the FBI and GSA
committed to establishing a fair and transparent process by
which a site would be selected. The GSA and FBI together
succeeded in this process goal through so much of the project.
However, in the final weeks of the process, the FBI identified
process concerns that we were unable to resolve with GSA.
First, when the SSA provided their report to us in August,
we were surprised to see that the SSA came to a different
conclusion than the Site Selection Panel's consensus
recommendation. The site selection plan allowed for this
divergence, but I can say that within the FBI's own procurement
shop, this is exceedingly rare.
Second, when the FBI reviewed the SSA's decision report, we
observed that the SSA prioritized subcriteria in a way that was
inconsistent with the published plan, and applied outside
information that repeatedly benefited the Greenbelt site and
disadvantaged the Springfield site compared to the panel
recommendation. The site selection plan gave the SSA authority
to come to a different conclusion than the panel, but the
consistent one-directional nature of the changes favoring
Greenbelt caused concerns for the FBI.
These concerns were exacerbated by the fact that the SSA's
immediate prior employer was the owner of the Greenbelt site.
The FBI raised its concerns in a briefing and through two
letters to GSA to move the project forward. The FBI requested
GSA select a new SSA to rerun the final step of the process,
picking an individual who did not have any previous affiliation
with the three sites. Ultimately, GSA did not accept this
request, and our concerns were not sufficiently addressed.
To be clear, the FBI does not object to the Greenbelt
location itself, and we are not suggesting a lack of integrity
on the part of the SSA. However, for a decision of this
magnitude, the process needs to be above reproach, and we
continue to hold concerns about how the final stage of the
process was conducted.
The FBI needs a new facility here in the national capital
region. The status quo is a drain on taxpayer dollars to
sustain a failing JEH facility that doesn't meet the needs of
our workforce or mission. But the fairness and transparency of
the process are essential, and we welcome the GSA Office of
Inspector General's review of the site selection process.
It is not easy, nor do we take lightly that we have raised
this area of disagreement. The FBI is grateful to the dedicated
public servants at GSA who have worked tirelessly to support
the FBI's new headquarters project. We look forward to the
OIG's review so that we can continue forward with GSA to
construct a new facility with the support of Congress.
Thank you, and I am happy to answer any questions that you
may have.
[Mr. Dimos' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Nicholas Dimos, Assistant Director, Finance and
Facilities Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation
Good morning, Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and Members of
the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you
today to testify about the new Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
headquarters project.
The FBI has occupied the J. Edgar Hoover (JEH) building since 1974.
Since that time, the mission of the FBI has evolved, particularly in
complex national security investigations and cases requiring
sophisticated technology tradecraft and tools--but the building and
technical infrastructure of the facility have not kept pace. Moreover,
the facility infrastructure of JEH has deteriorated to the point where
hundreds of millions--if not billions--of dollars would be required to
fully renovate and sustain it. Concrete on the exterior of the building
is crumbling, and netting is attached around the building's perimeter
to catch concrete from falling onto pedestrians passing by on sidewalks
below. There have also been instances where interior concrete has
fallen into employee workspaces. Pipes routinely leak or burst, which
has resulted in damage to FBI technology, records, and space.
The General Services Administration (GSA) has conducted several
Building Evaluation Reports (in 2001, 2011, and 2019) that all reached
the same conclusion--the building is in poor condition and action is
required to address life safety issues and failing equipment. Given
that JEH has been scheduled for replacement for over a decade, longer
term facility infrastructure investments have been deferred,
exacerbating the operations and maintenance challenges typically
associated with a 50-year-old facility. Each year, the FBI and GSA are
forced to reprioritize limited funding to conduct emergency, stop-gap
repairs to ensure the safety of personnel working in the building and
to maintain continuity of operations.
The FBI must fight against 21st century threats, not those of 1974.
The men and women of the FBI need access to modern, high-tech tools and
spaces to seamlessly communicate and collaborate with FBI operators and
partners located across the country and world. Due to the nature of the
FBI's work, which requires access to classified and sensitive
information and networks, personnel need to work in FBI office space to
support day-to-day FBI operations. Deteriorating infrastructure and
failing technology of the current headquarters building will continue
to make it more and more difficult to rapidly address developing
threats and collaborate across FBI divisions and programs.
As the FBI planned for the replacement of JEH, we reassessed what
functions need to remain in the national capital region (NCR) versus
those that can be re-located to other parts of the United States. Based
on this multi-year reassessment of the facility footprint, FBI
headquarters now consists of many different locations across the
country. The FBI has moved and consolidated its data centers from
costly leased locations in downtown areas to owned facilities with
significantly lower costs of power and infrastructure. The FBI
relocated certain mission areas and training functions to Redstone
Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama that were either originally housed in
costly space in the NCR or were subject to space and capacity
constraints at the FBI campus in Quantico, Virginia. The FBI also
relocated its records management facilities, and we have expanded our
operations in Clarksburg, West Virginia.
Because of this realignment of workforce functions across the
country over the past several years, the new facility that would
replace JEH here in the NCR would include less total square footage
than previous iterations of this project and will house those personnel
and functions that must remain in the NCR.
The FBI is committed to ensuring that any new facility is a good
deal for the taxpayer, and the new suburban FBI headquarters would
allow the FBI to consolidate space and eliminate the need for multiple
leased locations in the NCR, thereby saving tens of millions of dollars
in annual lease payments. We have also worked to reduce costs in other
ways, such as by consolidating case files and evidence storage to
centralized locations in lower cost areas.
While the FBI has relocated thousands of headquarters personnel
outside of the NCR, many functions need to remain in the NCR to fulfill
the mission. The NCR houses many key members of the Intelligence
Community, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and other law enforcement
partners that the FBI works with each day to fulfill our law
enforcement and national security responsibilities. Also, many FBI
headquarters functions coordinate directly and frequently with
operations in Quantico, to include the FBI Laboratory, Operational
Technology Division, Critical Incident Response Group, and Training
Division, which are not slated to consolidate into the new NCR
headquarters facility.
The FBI has worked closely with our colleagues at GSA over the past
decade on potential solutions that meet the FBI's space needs while
recognizing the considerable challenges of funding such a large and
complex project. We were encouraged that the previous procurement
process in 2017 resulted in considerable interest by the private sector
to help secure a new headquarters facility. However, without full
funding, the FBI and GSA determined that continuing to move forward
with the 2017 procurement would have put the government at risk for
project cost escalations, which was made more complicated by the
exchange proposal for the JEH parcel of land. For these reasons, the
FBI and GSA jointly made the decision to cancel the prior procurement.
From 2018 to 2021, the FBI and GSA advanced a proposal for the FBI
headquarters to remain in downtown Washington, D.C., in a newly
constructed facility. This new downtown facility would have been
smaller than the proposed 2017 facility, but would have allowed for
consolidated space in close proximity to DOJ and other mission
partners, in a centralized location for the FBI workforce and other FBI
mission locations like Quantico. Then, in March 2022, through the
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Congress directed GSA to choose
one of the three sites identified through the prior 2017 procurement--
Greenbelt, Maryland; Landover, Maryland; or Springfield, Virginia--to
be the future home of the FBI's suburban campus in the NCR. As a
result, through the spring and summer of 2022, the GSA and FBI worked
together to develop a site selection plan and process by which the
suburban site would be selected from these three locations, with a
clear focus on what is best for the FBI workforce, the mission, and the
American taxpayer. In September 2022, GSA publicly released the site
selection plan that would be used to pick the site, which was closely
coordinated with the FBI. This plan considered five criteria: FBI
Mission Requirements, Transportation Access, Site Development
Flexibility, Promoting Sustainable Siting and Advancing Equity, and
Cost.
Following the release of the plan, in December 2022, Congress
passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which directed GSA to
hold consultations with representatives for each of the three sites to
discuss the site selection plan. Those consultations took place in
March 2023. Following the consultations, GSA amended the site selection
plan in July 2023 and then commenced the site selection process, which
included convening a panel of three career GSA and FBI officials to
make a consensus recommendation. After the panel submitted its
recommendation of Springfield, Virginia, the GSA Site Selection
Authority (SSA) conducted their own review and chose Greenbelt,
Maryland as the suburban headquarters location.
Throughout the selection process, the FBI coordinated closely with
GSA. Of paramount importance to the FBI has always been fairness and
transparency in the process--irrespective of the specific site chosen.
When GSA provided the FBI with its site selection decision, the FBI
identified several areas of concern regarding the process, which we
promptly expressed to GSA. In a September 2023 memorandum, FBI
Associate Deputy Director (ADD) Brian Turner laid out the FBI's
identified process concerns. Specifically, the FBI noted in this
memorandum our view that the SSA did not follow the site selection plan
regarding the weighting of specific subcriteria. The published site
selection plan states, ``subcriteria are of equal importance,'' whereas
the FBI observed instances where we believe the SSA applied independent
analysis indicating the relative importance of some subcriteria over
others. The SSA also included outside information when evaluating the
three sites. The site selection plan allows for this, but the FBI felt
obligated to raise its concern that outside information was included in
a way that from FBI's perspective consistently benefited the Greenbelt
site. This concern was intensified when the SSA did not accept the
consensus recommendation of the panel. The FBI observed that with one
immaterial exception, each of the SSA's deviations from the panel's
recommendation either benefited the Greenbelt site or disfavored the
panel's recommended site of Springfield, Virginia. Lastly, in this
memorandum, the FBI expressed concern about the appearance of a lack of
impartiality by the SSA, given the SSA's previous position as an
executive with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority
(WMATA), which owns the Greenbelt site.
GSA's response to ADD Turner's memorandum did not sufficiently
address these concerns. Accordingly, Director Christopher Wray
reiterated the FBI's concerns in a letter to the GSA Administrator on
October 12, 2023. To address what FBI viewed as concerns with the
process, and in an effort to move the project forward, the FBI
requested GSA to re-run the final stage of the site selection decision
process with a new SSA to ensure, from FBI's perspective, the
appropriate level of impartiality for a decision of this magnitude. As
the FBI has emphasized, including in this October 2023 letter
expressing our views, ``we are not suggesting a lack of integrity by
the PBS Commissioner. However, for a project of this magnitude and
significance where the unimpeachability of the selection process is of
vital importance, the SSA simply should not have previous, direct
affiliation with one of the parties of this procurement.'' The GSA did
not agree to the FBI's request, and instead proceeded to publish the
site selection decision on November 9, 2023. The FBI's process concerns
remain unaddressed.
The site selection process was a significant undertaking, and the
FBI is appreciative of the many men and women of the GSA who led and
supported this monumental task. Through this process, the FBI has had
the opportunity to work with many outstanding professionals at GSA--
dedicated public servants who have strived to support the FBI in
constructing a new headquarters that allows the FBI to do its work for
the American people. These GSA professionals support the FBI and other
government agencies tirelessly each day, and the FBI is grateful for
their dedication on this project and hundreds of others across the
country. To be clear, the FBI's concerns are specific to the site
selection process itself, and in particular, the final phase of the
selection process. For a project of this magnitude and significance, it
is critically important that each step is above reproach. From FBI's
perspective, the FBI's recommendation to select a new SSA--a real
estate expert with no affiliation to any of the three sites and an
individual independent from these past several months of site selection
deliberations--would have ensured the appropriate level of independence
and neutrality.
While the Congress and the GSA Office of the Inspector General
conduct their reviews of this process, the FBI will continue to
coordinate with GSA on the specific program of requirements for both
the suburban facility and a 750-1,000 seat downtown facility in a pre-
existing federal building, which will allow the FBI to maintain close
proximity to partners at DOJ and other law enforcement and governmental
partners downtown.
While the process review and construction planning activities take
place, the current J. Edgar Hoover building continues to deteriorate,
does not meet the needs of today's FBI, and is an inefficient use of
taxpayer resources. Our goal is to build a consolidated, modern,
secure, resilient facility that is capable of meeting the increased
demands of the nation's premier intelligence and law enforcement
organization now and in the future--housing the hardworking men and
women of the FBI for the next 50 or more years. In all of our efforts
on this project, we must continue to ensure that fair and transparent
processes are followed that leverage best practices in real estate,
procurement, construction, and fiscal stewardship.
Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and Subcommittee Members, I
thank you for this opportunity to testify on the new FBI Headquarters
project. We appreciate your interest and support. I am happy to answer
any questions you might have.

Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the witness and each of you for
your testimony. We will now turn to questions for our
witnesses. The Chair will now recognize himself for 5 minutes
of questioning.
Mr. Doomes, you just said in your testimony that the
criteria was not changed. But in July, didn't the SSA or others
change the weighting of the criteria?
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, thank you for that question. In
July of 2023, the criteria did change, but it was done in
collaboration----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. But it--so, it changed, right?
You just said there were no changes, but changing the weighting
of the criteria is a change in itself. Is that correct?
Mr. Doomes. Yes, Congressman.
Mr. Perry. That is correct, right?
So, you are the Regional Commissioner. You make these
decisions across the board for this capital region for a number
of different projects, and have done that, I would imagine,
successfully. That is why you are in the job. Is that right?
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, yes, I do have----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. You are the Regional
Commissioner. Did you have any involvement with this site
selection process at all?
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, yes.
Mr. Perry. OK.
Mr. Doomes. I was involved with the consultations that were
mandated by Congress in the December 2023 request by Congress
to consult with the Maryland and Virginia. So, I was involved--
--
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. And who was the authority prior
to July, when it changed? Who was the authority in this?
Mr. Doomes. A career official.
Mr. Perry. A career official that you know and you deal
with?
Mr. Doomes. Yes, Congressman.
Mr. Perry. And does that career official report to you on
these matters?
Mr. Doomes. No, Congressman.
Mr. Perry. Who does----
Mr. Doomes [interrupting]. Well, now she does, yes.
Mr. Perry. Now she does? Why not before?
Mr. Doomes. The way the GSA is set up, the Regional
Commissioner for the national capital region reported directly
to the Public Buildings Service Commissioner.
Mr. Perry. Directly to the Public Buildings Service
Commissioner. All right.
Well, I am just very curious as to why in July, after all
this time--remember, this is 15 years going--in July, all of
the sudden, we need to appoint somebody new at the top of this
who eventually overruled the site selection committee's
criteria.
Mr. Dimos, if Congress had not slipped language into the
fiscal year 2023 appropriations bill which directed the FBI to
only consider three sites in Maryland and Virginia, would these
represent the optimal sites for the FBI, the ones that are now
required?
Mr. Dimos. Chairman Perry, going back to 2018, really right
up through the appropriations language in 2022, it was the
FBI's position that the optimal solution was to be in a newly
constructed building closer to downtown Washington, given the
proximity to DOJ and other partners in the more downtown
region.
Mr. Perry. Is that based on mission? I don't want to put
words in your mouth. What is that based on?
Mr. Dimos. Sure----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. The optimal location.
Mr. Dimos. Sure, in terms of the level of interaction that
we would have with the Department of Justice, with the U.S.
Attorney's office, with the National Security Council, with
other law enforcement partners downtown.
It was also a centrally located area for our workforce and
for other sites that we have in the national capital region. We
have a number of sites in the NCR, and being in a centralized
location was our preferred approach.
Obviously, when the appropriation was passed in March 2022,
we heeded that direction and began the process----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. Right, and I understand you
didn't have any choice, but I find it interesting that people
not related at all to your mission--and quite honestly, while
there are times where I might disagree with your mission,
specifically the spying on American citizens and targeting
American citizens, but I would think the FBI would know best
what its mission requirements are. And I am wondering about
undue influence, whether it is from Congress or the GSA.
Mr. Doomes, the areas where Ms. Albert disagreed with the
panel seemed to always accrue benefit to Greenbelt. She
overruled the panel when evaluating transportation access, site
development flexibility and schedule risk, and sustainability
and equity, all in favor of Greenbelt. And interesting to me--
and, I think, the public--the acquisition costs for Greenbelt
went from over $200 million to now $26 million. That's a lot of
money, right, $175, $174 million. What changed? That's a lot of
money. What changed in that site?
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, thank you for that question. My
understanding is that WMATA, who owns the site, has offered it
to GSA at the price cited in the site selection decision, $26.2
million.
Mr. Perry. So, what changed from the acquisition cost for
Greenbelt? It's the same site. I understand WMATA, but it went
from $200 million to $26 million. Now, you are the Regional
Commissioner. What changed? Who is subsidizing this lowered
cost? Somebody has got to pay for something here. And is the
parking lot literally worth $174 million?
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, I will have to get back to you on
that. My understanding is that the site is valued at $26.2
million and that WMATA has offered to sell it to GSA at that
price.
Mr. Perry. But you would also agree that it is a reduction
in cost that was over $200 million.
Mr. Doomes. I will have to get back to you on that,
Congressman.
Mr. Perry. Well, my time is now expired for this round, so,
at this point, I will yield and recognize the gentlelady, the
ranking member from Nevada, Ms. Titus.
Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I would think you would like the fact that it went from
$200 million down to $26 million. That sounds like that's right
up your alley. Excuse me for that aside.
I want to ask you about the high mission criticality score,
if you could, Mr. Dimos. The Homeland Security--there is a 2021
edition of a risk management process study, and it said, and I
quote, facilities that ``house individuals or specialized
equipment necessary to identify and analyze threats to homeland
security'' have to have this high mission criticality score.
Do you think you can achieve that kind of facility
protection if you stayed and remodeled the building on
Pennsylvania Avenue?
Mr. Dimos. Congresswoman, at this stage, the work that we
have conducted over the last couple years has been focused on
the March 2022 congressional appropriation. And so, our focus
has been on developing a process to select a suburban site from
one of those three locations.
In terms of talking about specific security requirements,
we can follow up separately with the right level of security
experts to talk through that.
But my focus with GSA over the last couple of years has
been specifically on selecting from one of the three suburban
sites. Then, in addition to that, the 2024 President's budget
did include support for a smaller facility downtown for 750 to
1,000 people that we are coordinating with GSA on.
Ms. Titus. So, in the meantime, while you all have been
looking at these new sites, you have just let the facility on
Pennsylvania deteriorate? You are not trying to fix it, not
trying to improve it, just let it go to hell while you are
looking for something else?
Mr. Dimos. Thank you for that question. So, my staff and I
are responsible, in coordination with GSA, for ensuring the
building is maintained. And I will say it is a challenging
situation in terms of the concrete mitigation, the pipe repair,
the HVAC support. And I have got a heroic team of experts who
work to maintain the facility to the best of their ability.
What I would say is, it is a tradeoff of knowing that this
conversation has been ongoing about a new facility. We want to
invest in the building to ensure that we are keeping it stable
and safe, and at the same time, not invest too much funding
such that it would be imprudent, knowing that there is
ultimately a vision to leave the facility----
Ms. Titus [interrupting]. How much money do you----
Mr. Dimos [continuing]. At some period.
Ms. Titus [continuing]. Think you have spent on keeping it
up to date since 2011, when you decided you wanted a new
building?
Mr. Dimos. I can't speak for everything since 2011. I would
say over the last several years, with the support of Congress,
we were required to reprioritize about $75 million just to
address core water infrastructure to ensure we didn't have a
catastrophic breakdown of our water intake and outtake from the
building.
We are also having to invest in----
Ms. Titus [interrupting]. Besides the structural
improvements to keep the employees safe, what about security
issues, investment in keeping all that information secure?
Mr. Dimos. Sure. So, security is a key area of focus for
the FBI to ensure our space is safe, our people are safe, our
records and IT are safe. And so, we have made incremental
security investments to the facility to ensure that, in terms
of the things we can feasibly do, we are doing them.
There are, of course, many security features that we cannot
implement, given the 1974 construction. And so, we do the best
we can for modest security improvements.
Ms. Titus. You don't want to make it too nice or too good,
because then that might hurt your chances of getting a new
building, right?
Mr. Dimos. Congresswoman, we want to make sure--we have
limited resources in order to support the building. And to the
maximum extent possible, I want those resources to go towards
combating violent crime, human trafficking, international
terrorism.
Ms. Titus. OK, let me ask you this. The 2018 plan included
a SCIF, a SIOC, 72-hour backup power, mission briefing center,
blast and ballistic protection, visitor center, parking garage,
remote truck inspection facility, perimeter security, and
upgraded IT. Can you talk about, does any of that still exist,
or been worked on, or what the scope is of the current project?
Does it include all of that stuff?
Mr. Dimos. So, those specific requirements that you have
listed there would be the ones that would be included in our
construction plan for the suburban campus that we will be
working with GSA on, going forward.
Ms. Titus. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Perry. The gentlelady yields. The chairman now
recognizes the chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, Mr.
Graves from Louisiana.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to thank both of you for being here. I want to thank
you for your testimony.
Mr. Doomes, I understand how you may be shocked that folks
are questioning criteria and criteria being changed, but I do
want to just give you a little bit of perspective on the things
that we deal with.
In this committee, you can imagine billions and billions of
dollars in, for example, transportation grants have been given
to the Department of Transportation. And as we have gone
through and looked at the allocation of dollars, and we have
looked at the criteria that this Department of Transportation
has developed, we have watched as 17 percent of the overall
money has been given to the State of California, while 0.33
percent of the money has been awarded to the State of Alabama.
Those States--you can say, well, maybe it is population. Those
States have an eightfold difference in population, yet that is
a fifty-one-fold difference in the amount of allocation among
States.
So, said another way, I have observed how criteria has been
manipulated in a way to benefit specific States, areas, or
projects that I think otherwise do not stand on their own
merit. So, I want you to understand that backdrop under which
you are showing up here.
So, in that regard, it is my understanding that criteria
was changed, and you have noted the scoring issue that the
chairman noted. Were you asked--was anyone--did anyone come to
you and ask you to change that criteria?
Or are you aware of anyone from above, from White House,
political appointees or any others, that asked that that
criteria be changed, or that the weighting of the scoring be
changed?
Mr. Doomes. Thank you for that question, Congressman. What
happened was in December of 2022, Congress directed GSA and the
FBI to conduct consultations, meaningful consultations, with
the State of Maryland and Virginia. We held those consultations
in March of 2023. And then we worked collaboratively with our
partners over at the FBI to come up with new criteria.
And the changes we made in the criteria, I think it is
really important to talk about that.
One was, we decided to increase the percentage of cost. We
thought it was really desirable to increase our focus on
providing the lowest cost option for taxpayers.
And then we had governmentwide directives related to equity
that we felt like we needed to reflect.
And I will point out that mission remains the number-one
priority in the new set of criteria, but we worked on that
collaboratively with our partners, with the FBI. And they wrote
and they let us know----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. OK, OK. And I
appreciate that dialogue and engagement, and I certainly
respect that and think it is important.
But just going back to my question, was there a political
appointee, White House or anyone, that asked you or asked
anyone within GSA to actually change the criteria or change the
weight of the criteria?
So, putting aside State engagement and all those, was there
anyone along those lines?
Mr. Doomes. So, let me clarify. We had both political
appointees and career officials within GSA----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interposing]. Yes.
Mr. Doomes [continuing]. Meeting with career officials with
the FBI to come up with this new criteria.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Yes.
Mr. Doomes. So, no one outside of the agency, sir.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Right. So, it is--I am going to
surmise here--so, it is fair to say that there were political
appointees that weighed in on this and asked that the criteria
be changed or that the weight of the scoring be changed.
Mr. Doomes. Yes, there were political appointees that were
a part of that process, Congressman.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, thank you.
I am not sure which one of you to ask this question to, but
I certainly understand the accessibility of the site as being
really important. You want employees to be able to actually get
to work. And I understand that the site that you chose ranked
the highest in terms of transit accessibility, but then you
also have the requirement, at least in the previous scope, to
provide thousands of parking spots. And I just want to make
sure I understand that situation, and I am happy to take an
answer from either of you.
Mr. Dimos. Sure. So, for our workforce, we were definitely
advocating strongly to ensure max level of access to mass
transportation: Metrorail, regional rail, bus lines, as well as
accessibility to sites in the region.
In addition to that, certainly there is going to come a
time as we work through the program of requirements in more
detail leading up to the prospectus, where we will be having
significant discussions about the level of parking that would
be included on the site, something like that, about the amount
of parking, those details will be kind of more heavily
discussed towards the next stage of the process.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. And Director Dimos, thank you. I
am out of time.
Mr. Chairman, I just want to say it would be very helpful
if you all could help us understand the relationship between
how you scored the transit, parking, and then also if you
looked at actually making investments in new infrastructure to
improve the score for either one of those sites.
I yield back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The Chair now
recognizes the ranking member of the full committee, Mr.
Larsen.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you.
Mr. Doomes, I don't think anyone is arguing that the SSA
has the legal authority to make a decision that is not
recommended by a panel--in this case, the panel that made the
recommendations--but do you know, overall in the history, let's
say 25 years, how often the SSA has changed, has come up with a
different final recommendation that is a decision different
than the recommendation panel?
Mr. Doomes. Thank you for that question, Congressman. To my
knowledge, GSA does not keep a comprehensive database of all
the site selection decisions. But when we asked the staff to
take a look at it, it has happened a couple of times in the
last 25 years.
More specifically with the FBI case, in 2016, when GSA was
asked to do the first downselect, a panel of career officials
recommended several sites, and they excluded Springfield. And
the Deputy PBS Commissioner at the time decided not to accept
that recommendation, and decided, using their authority, to add
Springfield as one of the sites to be considered.
There is a second instance in 2006, in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania, where the Site Selection Panel recommended three
sites to the Site Selection Authority, and the PBS Commissioner
at the time rejected all three sites and chose another site
that was not even under consideration by the Site Selection
Panel. So, that was, yes, in 2006----
Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. Were either of
those subject to a further IG investigation, as this one is?
Mr. Doomes. I am sorry, Congressman.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Were either of those selections
subject to an OIG investigation, as this one is?
Mr. Doomes. Not to my knowledge, Congressman.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, OK. And if you could get
back to us with any further examples, that would be helpful. It
doesn't sound like there are a lot. Not just the numerator, but
maybe the denominator, as well, how many potential decisions
were made, and then how many were different, that would be
great.
Mr. Doomes. Yes, sir, we will----
Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. And not just in
the FBI case, any case.
Mr. Doomes. I am sorry.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Not just in an FBI case, but in
any case.
Mr. Doomes. In any case.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes.
Mr. Doomes. Yes, sir.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, thanks. It will just help
us, give us a perspective.
Mr. Dimos, as noted just now, in the first procurement, the
proximity of the site to the FBI's Quantico facility was not
included, and then it was added. Do you have insight, from the
FBI's perspective, about why that particular criteria was
changed, and Quantico was added?
Mr. Dimos. Sure. So, really, as I said earlier, going back
to 2018, 2018 to 2022, really, the view of the FBI was that
having that central proximity to partners and to other mission
assets was very important. We have employees traveling back and
forth to sites all the time, meeting with other law enforcement
partners, intelligence community partners. And so, being in
downtown Washington, it allowed for that central location.
Hearing Congress loud and clear in March of 2022 that we
needed to select a site from one of the three suburban
locations, we tried to reflect on kind of that base kind of
requirement of how do we be in close proximity to our other
mission sites. Quantico is the largest mission site that we
have in the national capital region, other than the Hoover
Building itself. And so, as we talked to a lot of stakeholders
within the FBI about what would enable the mission for the long
haul, being in close proximity to that site and other sites in
the area was deemed valuable.
For example, we did a study, a 60-day study looking at the
amount of meetings and back-and-forth between Quantico and----
Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. Yes----
Mr. Dimos [continuing]. Sites that were----
Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. Can I stop you
there? How relevant is that in a post-COVID era, and the
application of online, especially secured online? Because we do
VTCs overseas all the time on the military side.
Mr. Dimos. Yes, in a post-COVID era, like I said, we did a
60-day assessment----
Mr. Larsen of Washington [interposing]. Yes.
Mr. Dimos [continuing]. Between Quantico and other sites,
1,700 trips in a 60-day period between----
Mr. Larsen of Washington [interposing]. Yes, right.
Mr. Dimos [continuing]. The core sites that are
consolidating.
In law enforcement work, face-to-face engagement is needed
and common.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. It is needed and common. Is it--I
am not questioning it, only I just want to--I am questioning it
for the sake of understanding. Is that as relevant, though,
given the advancement of technologies to actually replace not
every face-to-face meeting, some face-to-face meetings?
I want face-to-face meetings all the time, too, but I don't
get that choice. I am not in your----
Mr. Dimos [interposing]. Sure.
Mr. Larsen of Washington [continuing]. Position, I get it.
But we have a very important job, too, and that requires face
to face as well as having to flex sometimes.
Mr. Dimos. Technology is certainly a really powerful
enabler, but from the data research that we did, we are still
seeing a significant amount of that direct face to face, and it
is powerful.
And the FBI, just by the nature of our mission, we are
heavy users of our space, coming into the office, using our
secret, top secret connectivity.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Sure, OK. Thank you very much.
I yield back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The Chair now
recognizes the gentleman from New York, Mr. D'Esposito.
Mr. D'Esposito. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good
morning, everyone.
I am sorry I missed the opening statements, but Mr. Dimos,
can you just tell me what year you joined the FBI, or started
working with the FBI?
Mr. Dimos. Sure, 2006.
Mr. D'Esposito. Great. And can you just explain to me what
the number-one mission of the FBI is?
Mr. Dimos. Countering and stopping acts of terrorism, sir.
Mr. D'Esposito. OK, so, to protect and defend the United
States of America against terrorists and foreign intelligence
threats.
Mr. Dimos. Yes, sir.
Mr. D'Esposito. OK. Given that mission to protect and
defend the United States of America against threats and enforce
criminal laws to protect its citizens, I would think that it
would be the main priority to be considered when selecting a
site for a new headquarters.
Would you say that during the selection process this was
considered above all other factors?
Mr. Dimos. Ensuring the mission of the FBI and how
facilities can support the mission of the FBI has absolutely
been at the forefront of our requirement.
Mr. D'Esposito. OK. And do you think that the decision, as
of this past July, to change the site selection criteria by
lowering the weight of the ``FBI proximity to mission-related
locations,'' and increasing the weight of ``advancing equity''
puts the FBI's readiness and advancing its mission at risk?
Mr. Dimos. Congressman, we viewed the September 2022 site
selection plan as optimal. However, we did work closely with
the GSA, ultimately, leading up to the July 2023 revisions to
the plan. And while we thought that the September 2022 plan was
best, we also deferred to GSA's judgment on the final
percentages in the July publication of the plan.
Mr. D'Esposito. OK, so, what I am going to do real quick is
I am just going to read, verbatim, the actual mission of the
FBI. The mission of the FBI is to protect and defend the United
States against terrorist and foreign intelligence threats, to
uphold and enforce the criminal laws of the United States, and
to provide leadership and criminal justice services to Federal,
State, municipal, and international agencies and partners.
So, with that mission in our thoughts, I am finding it hard
to understand why we would lower the weight of the proximity to
mission-related locations and increase the weight of advancing
equity. And I understand that you worked with the agencies that
were involved, there was communication, I understand all that.
But what I am trying to understand is why we would lower the
weight of the FBI proximity to mission-related locations, and
increase the weight of advancing equity when trying to find
proper locations in order for us to put forth the mission of
the FBI.
So, if you could expand on that a little bit, I would
appreciate it.
Mr. Dimos. Thank you, Congressman. As I said, of course,
our number-one priority in this was ensuring that this facility
could support the mission of the FBI, first and foremost, hard
stop, sir.
With that said, we do know there were other factors that
needed to be evaluated as part of a decision of this magnitude.
Cost was one of those areas, as well. If you compare the
September 2022 plan compared to the July 2023 plan, the
importance of cost did change from 10 percent to 20 percent.
And so, it----
Mr. D'Esposito [interrupting]. Well, I think we all agree--
--
Mr. Dimos [continuing]. Was a balancing act of multiple----
Mr. D'Esposito [continuing interruption]. Under the Biden
administration, costs have increased across the board in every
aspect.
But what I am asking here is how did equity come to play a
bigger role in this?
And how does advancing equity allow us to better the
mission of the FBI?
That is where I am not understanding. I understand the cost
analysis. I understand the conversations that were had. I
understand that you worked with the inner agencies of the FBI
to figure out the better locations. What I am trying to
understand, in the next 30 seconds, if you could explain to me
how advancing equity helps better live out the mission of the
FBI.
Mr. Dimos. So, what I would say to the equity criteria,
sir, is that there were two Executive orders that were signed
regarding equity and real estate decisions. And so, the FBI and
GSA had coordinated to also ensure that the site selection plan
appropriately complied with----
Mr. D'Esposito [interrupting]. And when were those
Executive orders signed?
Mr. Dimos. The first was signed in 2021, and the second, I
believe, was in 2022, sir. But I could be wrong.
Mr. D'Esposito. So, basically, we are following bad
Executive orders in order to promote politics instead of
actually living out the mission of the FBI. Not on you. You
guys are just following the rules.
But thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The Chair now
recognizes the gentlelady from the District of Columbia, Ms.
Eleanor Holmes Norton.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Commissioner Doomes, it is good to have you back on Capitol
Hill. You were one of my best Hill staffers that I have worked
with. So, it is good to see you in this new role. Of course, we
were sad to lose you.
I want to discuss with you, Mr. Doomes, GSA's site
selection process for the new FBI headquarters. But first, I
want to discuss the future use of this site of the FBI's
current headquarters here on Pennsylvania Avenue in my
district. The current site is a prime opportunity for mixed-use
development, which could help activate Pennsylvania Avenue,
draw visitors off the National Mall and into downtown, as well
as generate tax revenue for the District of Columbia, here in
my district.
What is GSA's plan for the current site after the FBI
moves?
And is GSA committed to working with the District of
Columbia as it plans for the future use of the site?
Mr. Doomes. Thank you for that question, Congresswoman. I
just want to be clear. GSA does have a plan for this site. We
are working through it. And the commitment I am willing to make
here with you today is to work with your office, as well as
local District of Columbia officials, about what that future
use of that site might be.
As you may be aware, as are other members of the committee,
GSA currently has a national portfolio plan that we are working
on, where we are looking at the entire inventory, all 363.3
million square feet of space that we have across this country,
and we are looking for opportunities to dispose of sites.
You may have seen that about a month ago, GSA announced
that we were disposing of 23 properties across this country
because we determined that we no longer had a need for it. So,
we would do that same asset segmentation policy for the J.
Edgar Hoover site.
And if we determine that it is surplus to the needs of the
Government, we would then work on a disposal strategy through
our Good Neighbor Program with the Office of the Chief
Architect to work with the local authorities and your office
about what the future might be for that site, including up to
disposition.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Doomes.
The site selection plan for the new FBI headquarters
established a Site Selection Panel and a Site Selection
Authority, Mr. Doomes. What were the respective
responsibilities of the panel and the selection authority?
Mr. Doomes. I really appreciate that question,
Congresswoman, because I would like to clarify for the record.
The Site Selection Panel was assembled to make
recommendations to the Site Selection Authority, which is
common for all GSA site selections. This expert panel, made up
of two career experts, was expected to go through all the
information that was provided by all of the jurisdictions,
examine all the issues as outlined in the site selection plan
which GSA made publicly available, and it was always
contemplated that the Site Selection Panel would make a
recommendation to the Site Selection Authority.
And I think it is important to clarify that the Site
Selection Authority looked at the 12 subcriteria across the 5
criteria, and subsequently the Site Selection Authority
accepted 9 of the 12 recommendations that the Site Selection
Panel made.
For the three criteria where the Site Selection Authority
did not accept the recommendations of the Site Selection Panel,
the Site Selection Authority in the site selection decision
carefully went through and explained why they did not accept
those three recommendations. And this is why we consider this
one of the most transparent site selection processes that GSA
has ever been involved in.
We have not typically released a site selection plan and
the site selection criteria, or the detailed site selection
decision, where we went through in a painstaking way in a 40-
page decision explaining why the Site Selection Authority, on 3
of the 12 recommendations that the Site Selection Panel made,
did not accept. And the Site Selection Authority very clearly
outlined that this was a close question.
As the FBI has acknowledged, all three sites meet their
mission needs, but it was our job to determine which of those
three sites best met their needs. And we decided, and GSA made
the decision that the Greenbelt site was the most transit-
oriented site, it was the lowest cost to the taxpayers, one
that advanced the Presidential directive on equity and
sustainability the most, and also offered the most project
certainty. And we thought those were all the reasons that the
Greenbelt, Maryland, site was the best site for taxpayers.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, I yield back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady. The Chair now
recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi, Representative
Ezell.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Doomes, I would like to start with you. Thank you for
being here today, and our witnesses. We appreciate it.
But how often do political appointees at GSA disagree with
the recommended decision of GSA career experts?
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, that is a great question. It is
hard to give you a comprehensive answer, but we can cite to at
least one other instance where the political head of the GSA
Public Buildings Service overturned a Site Selection Panel
decision. It was in 2006, with the siting of the Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania, courthouse. The Site Selection Panel made a
recommendation of three sites, and the Site Selection Authority
actually chose a fourth site that was not under consideration
by the Site Selection Panel.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you. Do we have a detailed record that
documents instances when a political appointee has been
designated the role of the Site Selection Authority?
Mr. Doomes. I don't believe we have a detailed document,
but GSA has endeavored to look through past decisions and look
for instances.
Here, in an earlier case with the FBI in 2016, the Site
Selection Panel recommended that the Springfield site be
excluded from any consideration, and the Site Selection
Authority decided not to accept that recommendation, and that
GSA should consider the Springfield site.
Mr. Ezell. I understand that the weights were changed for
all criteria, and the expert panel still chose Springfield, yet
a political appointee chose Greenbelt. To me, it seems like
there was a directive from the White House to ensure Greenbelt
emerged as the preferred choice. In between the panel's
recommendation and the final report, was there any directive
from the White House?
Mr. Doomes. No, sir.
Mr. Ezell. Would you be willing to share any documents or
correspondence that may have come from the White House, GSA,
and the executive branch, if there is any documents?
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, I am committed to working with you
to produce any correspondence, if it exists. I am not sure that
it does, but I will work with the Office of General Counsel to
get you that information.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
Mr. Dimos, given the FBI's preference to stay in downtown
DC, do you believe the FBI would ever truly accept a decision
to move the headquarters out of downtown DC?
Mr. Dimos. Congressman, thank you for the question. What we
said throughout the process from when Congress passed the law
in March of 2022 until today is, as long as a fair and
transparent process is followed, we will follow the law. And
the law said that the FBI shall go to one of those three
suburban sites, and that has not changed, sir.
Mr. Ezell. How do you respond to the allegations that
Director Carnahan said the FBI's concerns with the process had
no merit?
And do you feel this process was fair and transparent?
Mr. Dimos. Thank you, sir. So, this is an area of
disagreement between the FBI and the GSA. We have identified
process concerns, as you even alluded to, in the fact that it
is exceedingly rare that a Site Selection Panel's
recommendation is not accepted by the Site Selection Authority.
Even within our own FBI procurement shop, we canvassed our lead
contracting officers, and it was exceedingly rare that such a
situation had occurred.
Combining that with the number of instances where there was
a disagreement between the panel and the Site Selection
Authority, we were concerned to see so consistently the
disagreement by the SSA led to an increase to the Greenbelt
site and a decrease to the Springfield site. And again, just
exacerbated by the fact that the SSA was ultimately a senior
executive by the owner of the Greenbelt site.
Those things, taken in aggregate, just created areas of
process concern for us, sir.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you very much. Thank you both for being
here today.
And Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman. The Chair now
recognizes the gentlelady from Kansas, Representative Davids.
Ms. Davids of Kansas. Thank you, Chairman, and thank you to
the chairman and the ranking member, Ms. Titus, for holding
this hearing today. And then, of course, thank you to our
witnesses for taking the time to testify.
I represent the Third Congressional District in Kansas,
which is part of the Greater Kansas City metro area and home to
a pretty significant Federal real asset footprint. And like a
lot of places in the country with this kind of Federal nexus,
we do depend on the GSA to serve as a good steward of taxpayer
resources and to serve as a fair landlord in our communities.
And those expectations, of course, are no different for the
assessment of a location selection and construction for the new
FBI headquarters.
So, I do want to focus on the expressed needs that are at
the center of this hearing. And some of this is a followup to
some of the questioning we have heard from Ranking Member Titus
and others.
Mr. Dimos, I would like to hear. Since the GSA and FBI
began working on this project in 2011, can you tell me how many
FBI employees have been moved from the national capital region,
or NCR, to other FBI sites around the country?
Mr. Dimos. Sure. So, over the last several years, to your
question, Congresswoman, the FBI has gone through a
reassessment of the geographic location of our workforce. One
particularly significant site for us has been our expanded
presence in Huntsville, Alabama. We have actually been in
Huntsville for 50 years through the Hazardous Devices School.
But over the last decade in particular, a renewed investment
for Huntsville, for technology positions, a training academy.
At this point, we now have nearly 2,000 individuals in
Huntsville today.
We have also increased our presence in Pocatello, Idaho,
and increased our presence and functions in Clarksburg, West
Virginia. Of course, we operate 56 separate field offices
across the country. Over the past several years, we have also
looked at opportunities of taking headquarters positions and
pushing them back out to the field offices to ensure that we
are supporting our field operatives where the cases are being
run.
Ms. Davids of Kansas. Yes. Can you talk a little bit about
how the calculation was made of the FBI employees in the new
building over the course--I mean, it has been quite a few
years. Can you talk a little bit about how that calculation
plays into the site selection decision?
Mr. Dimos. I just want to make sure I understand your
question, Congresswoman. Can you just restate it for me,
please?
Ms. Davids of Kansas. Yes. So, I am curious how, when
looking at the various sites and the site selection process,
how are you thinking about the calculation with the employees
that are going to be at the new headquarters with the movement
of employees to places like Huntsville or Idaho?
Mr. Dimos. Sure. So, we have done an assessment of what are
those functions that we think can operate effectively outside
of the national capital region, also, in particular, thinking
about where we may have partners in other parts of the country
where it may be valuable to be collocated with those partners.
Not all partners are in the NCR. And also looking at where we,
quite frankly, have available real estate. We had available
real estate in Clarksburg, West Virginia, to be able to
transition employees.
And so, kind of the net of that is, we still have a large,
multithousand presence here in the national capital region for
those functions that we believe are important to be in close
proximity to intelligence community partners, law enforcement
partners here in the NCR, as well as having access to the tech
talent of the vendor community. We rely on industry to support
us in some of our high-tech mission space, and this is a region
of the country that has a lot of tech industry.
Ms. Davids of Kansas. Thank you. And then, because I have--
it will be 30 seconds, hopefully, for you to answer, Mr.
Doomes. I am curious if you could just--to follow on Mr.
D'Esposito's line of questioning, the ability for folks to get
to the building using transit and the parking situation, is
that part of the equity consideration when deciding where that
falls in terms of the priority levels?
Mr. Doomes. Thank you for that question, Congresswoman.
Actually, one of the criteria dealt expressly with
transportation access and transit access. The Greenbelt site is
0.1 miles away from the Metro station, as opposed to
Springfield, 0.5.
There were also some other subcriteria that dealt with the
commercial airports and their proximity to that, but that is
separate and apart from the criteria that deals with equity----
Ms. Davids of Kansas [interposing]. Oh, OK.
Mr. Doomes [continuing]. And sustainable development.
Ms. Davids of Kansas. OK, thanks. I just wanted to--I just
was curious and didn't know.
Thank you so much, I yield back.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady. The Chair now
recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee, Representative Cohen.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Chairman Perry. I appreciate you and
the ranking member for holding the hearing, and the chairman
for allowing me to waive on to this subcommittee. I appreciate
the witnesses for being here.
There is certainly great interest in the GSA site selection
process for the new FBI headquarters. My interest is more on
how we are going to determine the name of the new FBI
headquarters. In 1972, following J. Edgar Hoover's death, and
before much was known about some of the illegal activities he
engaged in, Congress passed a bill to name the existing
building as the J. Edgar Hoover Building.
J. Edgar Hoover did not uphold the laws of this Nation, the
U.S. Constitution, or the standard of justice in many
instances. It is absolutely inappropriate that our Nation's
leading Federal law enforcement agency building still be named
in his honor. Director Hoover was notorious for his regular
abuses against and prejudice towards civil rights leaders,
LGBTQ people, and African Americans at large.
From his creation of the Counterintelligence Program, or
COINTELPRO, which was a secret program aimed to ``expose,
disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize'' the
activities of Black nationalists, hate-type organizations, to
his FBI ``sex deviance'' program--he had a little thing about
gays. He didn't look in the mirror very often, but he had a
thing about gays. That nationalist hate-type organizations to
his FBI that used--he used them to attack and out LGBTQ
employees in the Federal Government. Director Hoover symbolized
the dangers of the weaponization of the Federal Government. He
weaponized the Federal Government like never before, and held
much incriminating data about Presidents, which some suggest is
why he kept his position for so long.
Relocation of the FBI building presents an excellent
opportunity to release the FBI and its headquarters building
from Director Hoover's tarnished reputation and instead pursue
a building name that will appropriately honor the
administration of justice.
We are privileged in Congress to have dinners that are
sponsored by David Rubenstein at the Library of Congress, and
the last one I attended--I think the last one held--was a lady
who wrote a biography of J. Edgar Hoover. She worked on it for
15 years, 800 pages. She had very little good to say about him
because of his misdeeds.
Mr.--is it Doomes? Thank you sir. The GSA Administrator, as
I understand it, has the authority to name buildings, but
typically looks to Congress for direction. I introduced H.R.
1175 this year, and I have introduced a similar bill for many
years, which would redesignate the J. Edgar Hoover Federal
Building as the Federal Bureau of Investigation building. Given
that the 1972 law expressly renamed the building constructed in
downtown, would the old name convey to the newly reconstructed
FBI building, or will it only receive a name when Congress
designates a name and the GSA adopts it?
Mr. Doomes. Thank you for that question, Congressman. The
expectation is that, if the building comes down, GSA would
defer to Congress a new building and how it is named.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you, sir. That would be appropriate, and I
appreciate the clarity.
It is important that the old name not carry over. The FBI
needs to be respected as an agency that does carry out its
duties of being fair and just in administering justice. And
what happened in Martin Luther King and his phone being tapped,
and the messages that were sent to him by the FBI suggesting he
should commit suicide because they had more information on him
which Mrs. King wouldn't want to know about, et cetera; what
they did in Chicago when they killed Black Panthers, they set
up with insiders and killed Black Panthers in Chicago; and it
looks like something happened with Malcolm X. His convicted
murderers have been released because they didn't do it. Who
knows what else he did?
Commissioner, I have one other question. It is my
understanding that in October of 2022 the GSA requested
authorization to lease space for an FBI field office in
Nashville. It is also my understanding the committee has not
considered that request. Can you explain the request for space
and the current status of the procurement?
Mr. Doomes. Thank you for that question, Congressman. I
want to be careful here, because that procurement is ongoing.
But it has been advertised. The contracting officer has three
offers on the table, but GSA will not proceed until this
committee provides a resolution in support of that prospectus,
at which point we would be able to make an award and move
forward on that project in Tennessee.
But I welcome the opportunity to let Mr. Dimos fill in.
Mr. Dimos. Thank you, Mr. Doomes.
Thank you for the question, sir. This is a very important
project for us. Congress approved the consolidation of our
Knoxville and Memphis field offices into a consolidated
Nashville field office in 2019, and so, the actual ability to
award the construction project in Nashville is critically
important for our employees who are already expecting that kind
of transition to Nashville. And so, this has been a 5-year-plus
endeavor.
And so, we would definitely appreciate your support, the
committee's support. And if there are any questions that the
committee has regarding the Tennessee consolidation effort, we
would be happy to schedule a follow-on discussion at a time
that is best for you, sir.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I do
have to say I felt there was great discrimination in the
decision to take the headquarters--to consolidate in Nashville.
It was obviously prejudiced in favor of hot chicken over
barbecue.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman. I am going to go
to a second round here.
Mr. Doomes, as you probably and likely know, this committee
had requested Ms. Albert be present for her testimony. And
fortunately or unfortunately, you are here--well, I wouldn't
say instead, but you are the one that is on the hot seat to
speak on behalf of whatever might have happened. So, I've got
some questions for you in that regard, and they are not
personal.
But the July 2023 update included changes to the Site
Selection Authority, shifting it from the Public Buildings
Service Regional Commissioner to the Public Buildings Service
Commissioner. This change occurred 2 years after the
appointment of Ms. Albert, meaning the GSA affirmatively chose
to remove an impartial PBS Regional Commissioner and replace
them with Ms. Albert, an individual they knew had worked for
WMATA, the landowner of one of the three potential sites, and
the one that was chosen.
Now, I say replace Ms. Albert with an individual that they
knew worked for WMATA [sic], or replace the Regional
Commissioner, the impartial Regional Commissioner.
[Slide]
Mr. Perry. I think that the Regional Commissioner was
impartial because on the previous report--I know you don't have
it in front of you, but I am showing it to you [indicating
report]--the name of that person is redacted, right? They don't
want any trouble for doing what the right thing is, making the
site selection based on the criteria.
It seems to me that Ms. Albert was brought in to fix the
situation, to get the result that was wanted. That is why,
after 2 years, she was brought into this whole process and
airdropped right into the middle of it, and then 2\1/2\ months
later, the announcement was made. The criteria was changed to
get the site selection that they wanted, and the decision was
made.
Who decided to make the change regarding Ms. Albert,
knowing that she had a potential conflict of interest? Who made
that decision?
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, thank you for that question. GSA
made that decision, so, I believe it may have been the Site
Selection Authority herself that made that decision, but I will
have to get back to you.
Mr. Perry. So, you are saying the person--wait, the person
whose name was redacted here [indicating report] made the
decision to replace themselves with Ms. Albert? Is that what
you are saying?
Mr. Doomes. The Site Selection Authority is the top real
estate official within GSA. We knew when we were making this
decision it was going to be a lot of scrutiny. Someone was
going to be unhappy, either Maryland or----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. The top real estate official, and
you knew at the time that Ms. Albert hasn't had a real estate
license, never sat for the exam, doesn't possess a real estate
license, but you took the top real estate official out and put
Ms. Albert in. And you are saying the Site Selection Authority
at GSA did that? That is what you are saying?
Mr. Doomes. I will need to clarify as to----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. I hope you do. I am wondering,
was there any outside input into that decision from anyone in
the Maryland elected delegation, or the Virginia delegation, or
OMB? Was there anybody from either one of those three
entities--delegations, elected delegation to Maryland,
Virginia, or the Office of Management and Budget--that weighed
in on that decision to replace that person with Ms. Albert,
knowing there was a conflict of interest?
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, what I will say is the head of GSA
heard from members of the Maryland and Virginia delegation
throughout the year about what their concerns were.
Mr. Perry. What was the tenor of those conversations?
Mr. Doomes. I think both delegations wanted their site to
be chosen.
Mr. Perry. Were you involved? Were you involved in those
conversations?
Mr. Doomes. No, sir.
Mr. Perry. Do you know of any of those conversations
directly with Ms. Albert?
Mr. Doomes. Certainly, and I am not aware that the Site
Selection Authority heard herself directly. I was referring to
the Administrator, who I know heard from both delegations.
Mr. Perry. So, the Administrator, but not--you can't
confirm whether Ms. Albert heard from the delegation or not.
Mr. Doomes. Sir, I am unable to provide an answer to that
question.
Mr. Perry. Did the Administrator, having heard from the
delegations and possibly OMB, the Administrator--did the
Administrator make this change to Ms. Albert?
Mr. Doomes. So, I want to be careful here to make sure I
understand your question, sir. Could you----
Mr. Perry. I want to know who made the decision and what
their involvement was with elected officials in Maryland and
Virginia, or potentially the OMB.
Mr. Doomes. I will have to get back to you on that one,
sir.
Mr. Perry. All right. Are you aware that the general
manager from WMATA, the transit agency that services the DC
metro area, has just announced the closure of 10 sites, 67 bus
routes, 2,000 employees losing their jobs due to lack of
funding?
Do you know if one of the potential closures of those 10
sites is the Greenbelt site?
Mr. Doomes. No, sir.
Mr. Perry. Would that affect the decision, if it were to
close?
Mr. Doomes. I would have to consult with staff on that and
get back to you.
Mr. Perry. Before I recognize the ranking member, I have
just got to tell you. I used to have this old truck that sat in
my tractor shed, and rodents would get into it because they are
just sitting out in the tractor shed. I didn't use it very
much, but I would get in it, and I could smell that they were
in there. I could smell the rat, because they've got a certain
smell about them when they are inhabiting the place.
The American people smell a rat here. They smell a rat, Mr.
Doomes. Unfortunately, you are here to answer for GSA. I am not
sure you are the right person. We've got to get to the bottom
of what happened here, because this does not fulfill the FBI's
mission.
There is crazy business with us subsidizing WMATA, who
apparently now appears to be subsidizing the FBI at the same
time they are getting ready to lay off 2,000 employees because
they can't pay their bills. They don't have any money to be
subsidizing anybody. What we should be focused on here is the
mission of the FBI and what best enhances that. And none of
these sites, not one of these sites--and this is not on you,
this is on Congress--but not one of these sites, according to
the expert here, Mr. Dimos, services the mission of the FBI.
With that, I yield to the ranking member, the gentlelady
from Nevada.
Ms. Titus. Thank you.
I would just ask you, Mr. Doomes, the GSA's objective is to
build the fastest and the cheapest, or to rent the fastest and
the cheapest. Aren't there a couple of facilities that exist
now on the Springfield site that would have to be taken down,
like a warehouse or something, before they could even start
preparing that site for construction? Wouldn't that make it
longer, take longer and cost more?
Mr. Doomes. Yes, Congresswoman. Actually, that was
contemplated in the site selection decision. Currently on the
Springfield site, there is a rather large warehouse, 1 million
square feet, in which we hold a personal property that is
excess to the Government needs. There is also a classified
tenant on the property, as well. And both of those facilities
would have to be moved, and there are costs associated with
moving both of those tenants. And that was one of the things
that was under consideration.
In fact, that's one of the things the Site Selection
Authority considered: project certainty. And project certainty
involves how soon, how quickly, and how costly it would be to
move the existing tenants on the Springfield site.
Ms. Titus. Have you all decided where you would move those,
or have you got to figure that out next?
Mr. Doomes. That would be the next part of the process, to
figure out exactly where those tenants would move. I believe
there is a site for the classified tenant, and they are going
through that process. But for the unclassified tenant, we are
putting together those plans now.
Ms. Titus. And it's not associated with the FBI in any way,
it's just something else GSA has?
Mr. Doomes. No, it is unrelated to the FBI.
Ms. Titus. OK, thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Perry. Mr. Dimos, in the Department of Justice OIG
report issued in October, it is mentioned that the FBI had
concerns in 2017 about the Greenbelt site due to the presence
of wetlands and limited constructible space. Does the FBI
maintain these concerns, especially now that it has been
announced that the Greenbelt site has been selected?
And will the Greenbelt site fully accommodate the
consolidation of the FBI headquarters and potential future
expansion?
Mr. Dimos. Thank you for the question, Chairman. All three
sites were deemed viable to be able to support the FBI----
Mr. Perry [interrupting]. I know that they were deemed
viable. You are representing the FBI. You are not representing
the other people on the panel. Congress that forced them--
trying to force these three sites down the FBI's throat. What
does the FBI say?
Mr. Dimos. Because of the site size and the challenges of
the wetlands, it does create construction challenges that we
would have to work through, through the program of requirements
process. It is not unachievable, but it is a construction
challenge.
Mr. Perry. Do you think it increases the cost?
I know you are not a constructor, right? You probably don't
build things.
Mr. Dimos. We would have to rely on developers to help us
with those cost estimates, sir.
Mr. Perry. Well, I suspect it would increase the cost.
Mr. Doomes, did the GSA seek an opinion from the Office of
Government Ethics and/or the Department of Justice regarding
Ms. Albert's appointment as a Site Selection Authority, given
her previous employment at Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority?
Mr. Doomes. Thank you for that question, Congressman. GSA
did seek the opinion of the Office of General Counsel of GSA to
address this issue of Ms.--the Site Selection Authority's
previous employment.
Just to give you a timeline, in July of 2021, the Site
Selection Authority was appointed as the PBS Commissioner.
Shortly thereafter, she was granted a limited authorization to
work on all matters related to WMATA and, in particular, the
FBI headquarters. So, this was contemplated nearly 9 months
before Congress downselected to the three sites that were under
consideration.
Mr. Perry. When did the GSA seek the opinion from the
Office of Government Ethics or the Department of Justice based
on what you just told me, when did they seek that?
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, I don't believe they sought the
opinion of the Office of Government Ethics. This was an
internal opinion offered by the Office of General Counsel for
GSA, rendered in July of 2021.
Mr. Perry. July of 2021 they rendered that decision, that
opinion? Do you have a copy of that for this panel?
Mr. Doomes. Yes, I have a copy, and I am more than willing
to share it with the committee.
Mr. Perry. I hope so. All right. Mr. Doomes, when does GSA
plan to submit a prospectus to the committee for the new FBI
headquarters building?
Mr. Doomes. Congressman, GSA intends to follow the law. In
the fiscal year 2022 appropriations bill, we were directed to
share information consistent with the prospectus within 180
days of selecting a site.
Mr. Perry. Within 180 days. So, that 180-day clock started
in September, when it was announced. Is that correct?
Mr. Doomes. Correct, Congressman.
Mr. Perry. All right. I thank the witnesses.
Are there any further questions from any members of the
subcommittee who have not been recognized?
Seeing none, that concludes our hearing for today. I would
like to thank each of the witnesses for your testimony. The
committee now stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:37 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Appendix

----------

Questions to Elliot D. Doomes, Commissioner, Public Buildings Service,
U.S. General Services Administration, from Hon. Rick Larsen

Question 1. One aspect of the previous procurement that was
particularly frustrating was GSA's refusal to acknowledge that there
would be a substantial delta between the value of the exchange and the
cost to construct the new facility.
Question 1.a. How much do you think it will cost to build a new
headquarters building?
Answer. GSA's fiscal year (FY) 2024 and FY 2025 budget requests
include appropriations language supporting the capital investment of
$3.5 billion through the creation of a Federal Capital Revolving Fund
(FCRF). This funding would be used to support the construction of the
FBI's new suburban headquarters campus in Greenbelt, Maryland. The FCRF
funding would be paired with $845 million in GSA prior year
appropriations to support the acquisition, design, and construction of
the FBI's new suburban headquarters campus.
The $3.5 billion is an estimate based on the previous program.
Updated cost estimates are needed, as the program has evolved and as
construction costs have increased since the previous program was
established. This estimate is for GSA's portion of the project; it does
not include the costs of FBI's information technology infrastructure or
furniture, fixtures, and equipment.

Question 1.b. How much do the FBI and GSA have in their accounts?
Answer. GSA was appropriated a total of $850 million across several
fiscal years, of which approximately $845 million is currently
available.
With respect to any available balances that the FBI might have, GSA
respectfully refers you to them.

Question 1.c. How are you going to close the gap? Are there any
funds remaining from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law?
Answer. None of the funds provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law are available to fund the FBI's new suburban headquarters campus in
Greenbelt, Maryland. Rather, those funds were specifically appropriated
to modernize land ports of entry along the northern and southern
borders.

Question 2. How much have GSA and the FBI spent on maintenance and
emergency repairs to the Hoover Building since the FBI concluded in
2011 that a new headquarters building was needed?
Answer. Since 2011, GSA has spent $8.2 million in maintenance and
emergency repair expenses at the J. Edgar Hoover (JEH) building.
According to information shared by the FBI with GSA, from FY 2016
through FY 2023, the FBI has spent approximately $157 million in
maintenance and repairs for JEH.

Question 3. In 2011 GSA and the FBI each developed plans for the
construction of a new FBI HQ. GSA recommended traditional federal
construction, which would require access to the full cost of
construction upfront \1\ and the FBI proposed a lease/lease-back
arrangement in which the Federal Government would ground lease land to
a private developer who would build the facility and lease it back to
the Federal Government.\2\

\1\ GSA, Report No. BDC-13001, Report of Building Project Survey
Federal Bureau of Investigation Headquarters Consolidation Washington,
DC, Metropolitan Region (Oct. 17, 2011).
\2\ FBI, Federal Bureau of Investigation Headquarters Consolidation
Project Report (Aug. 2011).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3.a. Which strategy was selected and why?
Answer. Neither strategy was selected at the time. Both full
appropriations and lease/lease-back arrangements were evaluated and
would likely have required approximately the same amount of upfront
funding, due to the budgetary treatment for capital leases, in
accordance with OMB Circular No. A-11, Appendix B.

Question 3.b. Which financing strategy would you recommend today?
Answer. GSA's budget requests for FY 2024 and FY 2025 propose the
establishment of a new FCRF, which would allow for the funding of the
FBI suburban headquarters campus in Greenbelt, Maryland. GSA is willing
to work with Congress to consider any viable funding mechanisms that
are able to meet this critical need.

Question 3.c. A P3, Federal appropriations, or a combination?
Answer. GSA's budget requests for FY 2024 and FY 2025 propose the
establishment of a new FCRF, which would allow for the funding of the
FBI suburban headquarters campus in Greenbelt, Maryland. GSA is willing
to work with Congress to consider any viable funding mechanisms that
are able to meet this critical need.

Question 4. How much money does GSA have for this project?
Answer. To date, GSA has received a total of $850 million across
several fiscal years, of which approximately $845 million remains
available.

Question 5. How much money does the FBI have?
Answer. GSA respectfully refers you to the FBI regarding their
available funding for this project.

Question 6. Is there enough available to buy a site, initiate a
design, and start construction?
Answer. Division E, Title V, Section 530 of the Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2022 (P.L. 117-103) required GSA to submit a report
on the FBI headquarters project within 180 days of site selection,
which was delivered to the Committees on March 28, 2024. Upon adoption
of approval resolutions by the Committee on Environment and Public
Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure of the House of Representatives, GSA intends to move
forward expeditiously with site acquisition, design, design-related
consulting services, management / oversight, and preliminary
construction support activities, using GSA's existing balances of
approximately $845 million.

Question 7. How far can you get in the development and procurement
process?
Answer. Please refer to the previous response.

Question 8. According to the DOJ IG's recently released Review of
the FBI's Planning for a Future FBI Facility \3\ GSA cancelled the
original FBI HQ procurement in July of 2017 due to insufficient
funding.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/24-004.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you explain the structure of that procurement, the concept of
the exchange, why it was not successful, and if you think the current
procurement should also include an exchange for property?
Answer. The 2017 Request For Proposals sought an exchange partner
to develop, design, construct, deliver, and operate a consolidated
headquarters facility for the FBI. As consideration for its
performance, the exchange partner would have received Federal
construction funding and, upon completion and acceptance of the new FBI
headquarters facility, fee simple title to the J. Edgar Hoover
Building, including the full city block around the building. In 2017,
GSA canceled the exchange project primarily due to a lack of funding.

Questions to Nicholas Dimos, Assistant Director, Finance and Facilities
Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation, from Hon. Rick Larsen

Question 1. The 2018 plan included a SCIF, a SIOC, 72-hour back-up
power, a mission briefing center, blast and ballistic protection, a
visitors' center, parking garages, a remote truck inspection facility,
perimeter security, and upgraded IT.
Question 1.a. What is the scope of the current project?
Answer. The current plan for a new FBI headquarters (HQ) consists
of two elements: a suburban campus for at least 7,500 personnel and a
facility in Washington, D.C. for approximately 750-1,000 personnel, as
outlined in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 President's Budget. The FBI will
work with the General Services Administration (GSA) to develop
requirements for the suburban and Washington, D.C. locations. These
efforts will determine the features for each location.

Question 1.b. How does it differ--in terms of size, scope, and
cost--from the previous procurement?
Answer. Prior to 2017, the original headquarters consolidation plan
included one suburban location in the national capital region (NCR) for
approximately 10,606 personnel. As part of this plan, the developer
chosen for the new location would have taken ownership of the J. Edgar
Hoover (JEH) Building site. This plan would have allowed the FBI to
consolidate personnel from 14 locations (i.e., the JEH Building plus 13
leased locations). At the time, GSA estimated this plan would have cost
$3.57 billion. While the FBI and GSA each received some appropriations
for the new FBI headquarters in FYs 2016 and 2017, GSA cancelled the
procurement for this project in July 2017 due to a lack of full
funding.
In 2018, the FBI and GSA presented a revised plan to demolish the
JEH Building and construct a new building on the same site for
approximately 8,300 personnel. The 2018 plan included approximately
2,300 fewer personnel as a result of the FBI's planned strategic
realignment of personnel to locations outside the NCR, including
Huntsville, AL; Clarksburg, WV; and Pocatello, ID. In the 2018 plan,
the FBI and GSA estimated the demolish and rebuild option would have
cost $3.33 billion at that time.
The current plan includes two locations--one suburban and one in
Washington, D.C.--estimated to accommodate a combined total of no less
than 8,500 personnel. The suburban location will be new construction.
The Washington, D.C. location is planned to be an existing federally
owned facility. This two-location plan reflects the importance of the
FBI maintaining close proximity to partners in Washington, D.C.
Since 2017, the FBI has reduced the number of leases in the NCR. At
this time, approximately 10 leases (including the JEH Building) are
planned to be consolidated into the new headquarters locations. The
total number of leases the FBI will be able to consolidate will be
impacted by the size of the new facilities, which will be determined by
the total funding available for the project and construction prices
when the project is eventually funded. Unlike the 2017 plan, the
current plan does not include an exchange of the JEH Building site to
the developer. In the FY 2024 President's Budget, the Administration
indicated the FBI would use $503 million in previously appropriated
funding for the downtown location and GSA would use $645 million in
previously appropriated funding plus $3.5 billion requested in the FY
2024 President's Budget from the Federal Capital Revolving Fund to
acquire and build the suburban location. Additional funding may be
required to furnish and outfit these locations.
The cost of this project requires additional evaluation after the
detailed requirements are completed. Also, the cost can be expected to
continue escalating with time.

Question 2. Full consolidation of all HQ employees into one
building was a priority for the FBI during the previous procurement.
Question 2.a. Is full consolidation still a priority for the FBI?
Answer. The FBI's priority has been, and continues to be, a safe,
modern HQ that meets the needs of the FBI and represents a good deal
for taxpayers. A new suburban FBI HQ would allow the FBI to consolidate
space, collocate currently dispersed personnel, and eliminate the need
for multiple leased locations in the NCR, thereby saving tens of
millions of dollars in annual lease payments.
The plan for a new FBI HQ never included a full consolidation of
all FBI leases in the NCR. The FBI has always planned to maintain some
leased locations in the NCR due to mission requirements that are not
suitable for a headquarters facility.
While the FBI still endeavors to consolidate as much as possible
into its new HQ facilities, the total number of leases the FBI will be
able to consolidate will be impacted by the size of the new facilities,
which will be determined by the total funding available for the project
and construction prices when the project is eventually funded.

Question 2.b. Does the current FBI headquarters building house all
employees which are assigned to it?
Answer. No, the JEH Building does not house all personnel who are
assigned to FBI HQ in the NCR.

Question 2.c. If not, how many leased spaces in the National
Capital Region (NCR) house FBI employees who don't fit into the Hoover
building? What is the annual cost of the leased spaces?
Answer. The FBI currently has approximately 10 leases in the NCR,
including JEH, slated to consolidate into new headquarters locations.
The FBI spends approximately $86 million each year for these leases.
After consolidation, the FBI will still maintain some leases in the NCR
due to mission requirements.

Question 2.d. Since GSA and the FBI began working on this project
in 2011 how many FBI employees have been moved from the National
Capital Region (NCR) to other FBI sites around the country?
Answer. Following a strategic review of job functions, the FBI has
approximately 2,000 HQ personnel at its facilities in Huntsville, AL as
of January 2024. Most of these functions were relocated from the NCR.

Question 2.e. How many FBI employees were included in the
calculation for the new building in 2011 and how many employees are you
including in the current calculation for the new headquarters?
Answer. Prior to 2017, the original headquarters consolidation plan
included one location in the NCR for approximately 10,606 personnel.
The current plan for the new HQ includes at least 7,500 personnel at
the suburban location and 750-1,000 personnel at the location in
Washington, D.C. The combined total for the two locations is no less
than 8,500 personnel.
