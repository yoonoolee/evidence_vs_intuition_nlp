July 13, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. ET to continue to receive testimony
from the remaining Federal agencies under the jurisdiction of
the Subcommittee related to the President's Fiscal Year (FY)
2024 Budget Request. The purpose of these hearings is to
provide Members with an opportunity to review the FY 2024
budget request, as well as the Administration's program
priorities within the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee.
At the first hearing, the Subcommittee will receive
testimony from the United States Army Corps of Engineers
(Corps), Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and Great Lakes St.
Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (GLS). At the second
hearing, the Subcommittee will receive testimony from the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),

quality nationwide through investment in wastewater
infrastructure, water quality standards, permitting programs,
water quality monitoring, wetlands protection, and research,
among other activities.\2\ The EPA's Office of Water manages
the EPA's water quality protection programs. The Subcommittee
also holds jurisdiction over the Superfund and brownfields
programs, which are managed by EPA's Office of Land and
Emergency Management (OLEM).\3\

\
\ The State and Tribal Assistance Grants program includes several grant programs other than the SRFs.
\\ Drinking Water SRF is outside of the Subcommittee's jurisdiction and falls under the jurisdiction of the
Committee on Energy and Commerce.
\*\ Includes appropriations to the following accounts: Buildings and Facilities; Leaking Underground Storage
Tank (LUST) program; and Inland Oil Spill program.

Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF): The FY 2024
budget request proposes $1.639 billion in Federal
capitalization grants for the CWSRF, which is equal to the FY
2023 enacted level.\6\ The CWSRF is the primary Federal program
for funding wastewater infrastructure projects and activities
throughout the Nation.\7\ CWSRF funds are used to provide low-
cost financing for state clean water infrastructure programs,
which in turn fund locally developed wastewater infrastructure
projects and activities.\8\ The CWSRF and Drinking Water SRF
are funded under the State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG)
account; which provides categorical grants to states and tribes
as part of the cooperative partnership between the Federal
government, states, and tribes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ EPA Budget Justification, supra note 4, at 1314; the FY 24
authorization for the CWSRF is $3 billion (see section 607 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1387)).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IIJA appropriated $2.403 billion for the CWSRF program for
FY 2024, supplementing regular appropriations.\9\ Additionally,
IIJA appropriated $225 million that same year for CWSRF to
specifically address emerging contaminants.\10\ IIJA also
reserved a portion of these funds to be distributed as grants
to economically disadvantaged communities.\11\

Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act Program
(WIFIA): Originally authorized by the Water Resources Reform
and Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014 (P.L. 113-121), the WIFIA
program provides low-interest loans or loan guarantees to
eligible entities for a wide range of Nationally and regionally
significant water and wastewater projects.\12\ The FY 2024
budget requests $80.4 million for the WIFIA program, a 6.3
percent increase from the FY 2023 enacted level of $75.6
million.\13\

\13\ EPA Budget Justification, supra note 4, at 955.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Environmental Programs and Management (EPM): This account
provides funds for internal programmatic activities. The FY
2024 budget requests $4.511 billion for EPM. This represents a
37.3 percent increase from the FY 2023 enacted level.\14\ IIJA
also appropriated $387 million in supplemental funding to this
account for FY 2024.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\14\ Id. at 1311.
\15\ IIJA, supra note 5. See also Appendix I.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Included in the EPM account, the FY 2024 budget requests
$32.5 million for the National Estuary Program.\16\ This
represents a decrease of 18.7 percent from the FY 2023 enacted
level of $40 million.\17\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Geographic (Regional) Programs: EPA's Geographic Programs
provide an opportunity to target regionally specific water
quality issues and to work closely with state and local
partners. The President's FY 2024 budget requests $682.1
million for geographic programs, an increase from the FY 2023
enacted level of $681.7 million.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\18\ Id. at 1308.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The FY 2024 request specifically includes: $368.2 million
for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI), $92.1
million for the Chesapeake Bay Program, $25.6 million for the
Gulf of Mexico, $25 million for Lake Champlain, $40 million for
Long Island Sound, $8.5 million for South Florida, $54.5
million for San Francisco Bay, $54 million for Puget Sound, $7
million for Southern New England Estuary, $2.2 million for Lake
Pontchartrain, and $5 million for other activities.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\19\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally, IIJA appropriated $343.4 million in
supplemental funding in FY 2024 EPA's Geographic Programs.\20\
This includes $200 million for the GLRI, $47.6 million for
Chesapeake Bay, $10.6 million for the Gulf of Mexico, $8
million for Lake Champlain, $21.2 million for Long Island
Sound, $3.2 million for South Florida, $4.8 million for San
Francisco Bay, $17.8 million for Puget Sound, $15.8 million for
the Columbia River Basin, $10.6 million for Lake Pontchartrain,
and $800,000 for other activities including the Pacific
Northwest.\21\

Superfund Program: The Superfund program was established by
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act (CERCLA) (P.L. 96-510) in 1980, and is run by
EPA's Office of Land and Emergency Management (OLEM).\22\ The
Superfund program is the Federal program established to clean
up the Nation's worst uncontrolled and/or abandoned hazardous
waste sites.\23\ The Superfund program is also available to
respond to emergency situations involving the release of
hazardous substances.\24\ EPA addresses the highest-priority
sites by listing them on the Superfund National Priorities List
(NPL).\25\ CERCLA requires responsible parties to pay for the
hazardous waste cleanups or response costs, and provides for
the Superfund Trust Fund to pay for remedial cleanups in cases
where responsible parties cannot be found or otherwise held
accountable.\26\

\26\ CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 103 [hereinafter CERCLA].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the 117th Congress, three excise taxes were reinstated
to pay into the Superfund. IIJA reinstated the Chemicals
Superfund Tax and Hazardous Substances Tax, while the Inflation
Reduction Act (IRA) (P.L. 117-169) reinstated a tax on crude
oil and petroleum products.\27\ The Consolidated Appropriations
Act of 2023 (P.L. 117-328) included language allowing tax
receipts collected in the Superfund Trust Fund from the prior
fiscal year to be available to implement CERCLA without further
Congressional appropriation and be designated as emergency
funding.\28\ This budgetary treatment prevents the collection
and spending of these receipts from counting toward the
Appropriations Committee's allocation or top-line funding
level. Therefore, these receipts are not included in the table
summarizing EPA's enacted and requested funding.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The President's budget requests $355.9 million in Superfund
appropriations, a decrease of 72.3 percent from the FY 2023
enacted level.\29\ However, the United States Treasury
Department forecasts collecting a total of $2.544 billion in
Superfund taxes in FY 2023 that will be available for use in FY
2024.\30\ These funds are covered by the budgetary treatment
change in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 and are
not included in the table of enacted and requested EPA funding.
Using these estimates, EPA's total budgetary authority for
Superfund as proposed by the President's budget would be $2.9
billion, a 71.0 percent increase from the FY 2023 enacted
level.

Brownfields: Brownfields are properties for which the
expansion, redevelopment, or reuse may be complicated by the
presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance,
pollutant or contaminant.\31\ Examples of these sites include
former industrial properties, gas stations, or dry
cleaners.\32\ EPA's OLEM manages the brownfields program.\33\
The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields
Revitalization Act (P.L. 107-118) authorized funding for EPA to
award brownfields assessment, cleanup and revolving loan fund
grants, and provided limited Superfund liability protections
for certain innocent landowners and bona fide prospective
purchasers.\34\

funding for EPA's brownfields program.\35\ This includes $131.0
million in site assessment and clean up grants (STAG account),
$47.0 million for authorized state brownfields programs (STAG
account), and $38.6 million for EPA's management of the
Brownfields program (EPM account).\36\ This represents an
increase of $43.2 million over the FY 2023 enacted levels in

Authorized mission activities include navigation, flood damage
reduction, hurricane and storm damage reduction, shoreline
protection, hydropower, water supply, recreation, environmental
infrastructure, environmental restoration, enhancement and
protection, fish and wildlife mitigation, and disaster response
and recovery.\39\ The water resources development programs and
projects of the Corps provide for continued economic growth,

IX. AGENCY FOR TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND DISEASE REGISTRY (ATSDR)

The ATSDR is housed under the Center for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) and is the Nation's public health agency
for chemical safety.\113\ ATSDR was created by CERCLA to assess
the presence and nature of health hazards at Superfund sites
and was formally organized in 1986.\114\ Under its CERCLA
mandate, ATSDR's work falls into four functional areas: (1)
protecting the public from hazardous exposures, (2) increasing
knowledge of toxic substances, (3) educating health care
providers and the public, and (4) maintaining health
registries.

opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID ROUZER OF NORTH CAROLINA,
CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON WATER RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT

Mr. Rouzer. Today's hearing is part 1 of 2 in a series of
hearings this subcommittee will hold on the President's fiscal
year 2024 budget proposal. We will hear from the remaining
agencies under this subcommittee's jurisdiction in part 2, but
today, we are pleased to have with us the United States Army
Corps of Engineers and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for
Civil Works, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Great
Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation.
I appreciate that we have both Major General Graham here
today from the Corps and the Assistant Secretary of the Army
for Civil Works, Mr. Connor, from the political leadership with
us here, as well.
Thank you, gentlemen.
To start, I want to bring attention to an issue that is
incredibly important to my constituents in North Carolina and
communities all across the country: the definition of waters of
the United States, or WOTUS, as we so often call it. The Corps
plays a major role in enforcing the Clean Water Act section 404
``dredge and fill'' permitting program over waters that are
considered WOTUS.
The WOTUS question has been debated for decades in court,
along with a variety of Presidential administrations weighing
in. But the definition of WOTUS and its implementation is more
than simply a few words that lawyers and bureaucrats can make a
career of, and many have. It is an issue regulated communities
deal with daily, including our farmers, ranchers, homebuilders,
private property owners, and infrastructure developers, among
others.
The Supreme Court recently delivered, in my opinion, a very
clear, seemingly easily implementable decision regarding the
definition of WOTUS in Sackett v. EPA. This ruling enables the
administration to kickstart project completion and eliminate
regulatory redtape, while maintaining crucial environmental
protections. The Supreme Court has now clarified what the
intended scope of the Clean Water Act has been from the
beginning. With the discarding of the ``significant nexus''
test, regulated communities will finally have some clarity
under the law.
Now it is up to EPA and the Corps to quickly bring the
Biden administration's legally flawed and obsolete WOTUS policy
into compliance with the Sackett decision, and provide
implementation guidance consistent with the ruling. Regulated
communities deserve the clarity of the Sackett ruling to be
implemented in Corps districts across the country so that
important projects can be permitted to move forward. I hope the
Corps will focus its work towards compliance with Sackett,
rather than trying to find a way around it.
On another note, Major General Graham and Assistant
Secretary Connor, you both know how important the Corps
projects are around the country, and my district, the Seventh
Congressional District of North Carolina, is certainly no
different. The beaches in my district rely on regular Army
Corps maintenance to protect life, property, and our critical
tourism economy. I am pleased the Corps has provided an
emergency use exemption of the Masonboro Inlet as the
Wrightsville Beach borrow site for the upcoming renourishment
project, which is a year delayed, as you know. Without speedy
nourishment, Wrightsville Beach could suffer catastrophic
disaster and losses in the event of a natural disaster.
I also look forward to the administration's approval of the
$10 million in emergency funding for the project under the
flood control and coastal emergencies account, and I appreciate
all the great work you all are doing on that front.
The President's budget proposal and the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act would provide the Corps with robust
funding, especially for flood control and beach nourishment
maintenance activities. I hope the Corps will use the funds
provided by both the IIJA and regular appropriations
efficiently for those such projects.
Also, I have represented here today two other important
entities, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Great Lakes
St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. TVA has not taken
any Federal funds since 1999, which certainly is rare among
entities created by Congress. I look forward to hearing more
about TVA's ``all-of-the-above'' energy approach utilizing a
diverse portfolio of energy sources, including solar, natural
gas, and nuclear, all while providing relatively stable rates
and reliable power to its consumers.
I would also like to offer TVA a special congratulations on
their 90th anniversary this year.
Finally, congratulations to Mr. Tindall-Schlicht on his
appointment as Administrator of GLS. GLS plays a very important
role ensuring crucial routes from the Great Lakes to the
Atlantic Ocean remain open via the St. Lawrence Seaway. At a
time when we understand the need to strive for economic
prosperity in the face of global competitors like China, the
GLS provides important services to the flow of minerals, steel,
and other critical goods.
I look forward to hearing from each of our witnesses today,
and I thank each of you for being here.
[Mr. Rouzer's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. David Rouzer, a Representative in Congress
from the State of North Carolina, and Chairman, Subcommittee on Water
Resources and Environment
Today's hearing is part one of two in a series of hearings this
Subcommittee will hold on the President's Fiscal Year 2024 budget
proposal. We will hear from the rest of the agencies under this
Subcommittee's jurisdiction in part two, but I am glad to see that
today we have before us the United States Army Corps of Engineers
(Corps) and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, the
Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway
Development Corporation.
Let's start with the Army Corps of Engineers. I appreciate that we
have both Major General Graham here today from the Corps itself and the
Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Mr. Connor, from the
political leadership here as well.
I'd like to start by bringing attention to an issue that is
incredibly important to my constituents in North Carolina and
communities across the country: the definition of ``waters of the
United States'' or ``WOTUS.'' The Corps plays a major role in enforcing
the Clean Water Act Section 404 ``dredge and fill'' permitting program
over waters that are considered WOTUS.
The WOTUS question has been debated for decades in court and
through varying Presidential Administrations. But the definition of
WOTUS and its implementation is more than simply a few words that
lawyers and bureaucrats can make a career out of. It is an issue
regulated communities deal with daily, including farmers, ranchers,
homebuilders, private property owners, and infrastructure developers.
I was heartened to see the Supreme Court deliver a clear, seemingly
easily implementable decision over the definition of WOTUS in Sackett
v. EPA last month. This ruling enables the Administration to kickstart
project completion and eliminate regulatory red tape while maintaining
crucial environmental protections. Now that the Supreme Court has
clarified what the intended scope of the Clean Water Act has been from
the beginning--once and for all getting rid of the ``significant
nexus'' test--regulated communities will finally have some clarity
under the law.
Now it is up to EPA and the Corps to quickly bring the Biden
Administration's flawed and legally outdated WOTUS policy into
compliance with the Sackett decision and provide implementation
guidance consistent with its direction. Regulated communities deserve
the clarity that came in Sackett to be implemented in Corps districts
across the country, so that important projects can be permitted to move
forward. I look forward to the Corps putting its resources towards
ensuring compliance with Sackett, rather than trying to find a way
around its requirements.
On another note, Major General Graham and Assistant Secretary
Connor, you both know how important the Corps' projects are around the
country, and my district--the seventh district of North Carolina--is no
different.
The beaches in my district rely on regular Army Corps maintenance
to protect life, property, and our critical tourism economy. I am
pleased the Corps has provided an emergency use exemption of the
Masonboro Inlet as the Wrightsville Beach Borrow Site for the upcoming
renourishment project, which is a year delayed, as you know. Without
speedy nourishment, Wrightsville Beach could suffer catastrophic
disaster and losses in the event of a natural disaster. I also look
forward to the approval of 10 million dollars in emergency funding for
the project under the Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies account.
And I appreciate all the great work you all are doing on that front.
The President's budget proposal and the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act (IIJA) would provide the Corps with robust funding,
especially for flood control and beach nourishment maintenance
activities. I hope the Corps will use the funds provided by both IIJA
and regular appropriations efficiently for important projects.
Moving on from the Army Corps, we also have folks here from two
other important entities: the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the
Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (GLS).
TVA has not taken any federal funds since 1999, which certainly is
a rarity amongst entities created by Congress. I look forward to
hearing more about TVA's ``all of the above energy approach,''
utilizing a diverse portfolio of energy sources, including solar,
natural gas, and nuclear, all while providing relatively stable rates
and reliable power to its consumers.
I would also like to offer TVA a special congratulations on this
year being its 90th anniversary.
Finally, congratulations to Mr. Tindall-Schlicht on his appointment
as Administrator of GLS. GLS plays an important role in ensuring
crucial routes from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean remain open
via the St. Lawrence Seaway. At a time when we understand the need to
strive for economic prosperity in the face of global competitors like
China, the GLS provides important services to the flow of minerals,

Mr. Rouzer. I now recognize Ranking Member Napolitano for 5
minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO OF CALIFORNIA,
RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON WATER RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT

Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding
today's hearing on President Biden's fiscal year 2024 budget
and agency priorities.
First, I want to thank the agencies' representatives for
attending today's hearing, especially Assistant Secretary
Connor and General Graham from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. The Corps continues to be a leader in addressing the
water resources challenges facing every corner of this Nation,
including the apparently-not-so-unique drought challenges in my
region, and I want to thank you for your service to my
constituents and to the rest of the Nation.
Mr. Chairman, annual budget proposals of the administration
and congressional leaders provide valuable insight into the
goals and priorities of their authors. Annual budgets provide
an objective way to compare and contrast competing visions for
the future of our country and for all we stand for in
representing our constituents.
This year, the contrasts are stark and telling.
The Biden administration proposal lays out a bold vision to
grow the economy from the bottom up, to invest in cleaner,
greener, and more accessible infrastructure, to create jobs and
opportunities for all people, and to restore and protect our
environment. That is the same vision shared by the House
Democrats, who, last Congress, passed the largest
infrastructure investments in over a generation through the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act,
as well as other transformational infrastructure investment
bills, such as the fifth bipartisan Water Resources Development
Act, or WRDA, in a row.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that.
With each dollar invested and each new WRDA project
implemented, everyday Americans will continue to reap the
benefits of these transformational laws through reduced
transportation congestion, cleaner air, cleaner water, and a
safer, more resilient and more livable environment.
I am concerned, however, that in the few months of control
of the House, the Republican leadership has advanced a debt
limit proposal that sought to hold hostage the ``full faith and
credit'' of our economy while blindly slashing critical
investments in our economy, our infrastructure, and our quality
of life. For example, the House Republican debt limit proposal
would have slashed funding for the Corps of Engineers by almost
25 percent, which would have significantly slowed project
delivery and delayed the realization of critical
transportation, flood control, and environmental benefits
authorized through annual WRDAs.
The House Republican proposal would have worsened supply
chain delivery challenges, would have left rural and coastal
communities more vulnerable to extreme weather events and
flooding, and would have threatened critical environmental
restoration projects like those in the Chesapeake Bay and the
Florida Everglades.
I am further concerned that there has been a focus on
putting polluters over people and eliminating Clean Water Act
protections on over half of the Nation's wetlands and up to 70
percent of the Nation's streams, rivers, and lakes. Congress
needs to be protecting our rivers and streams and other water
bodies for future generations. We need to be empowering States
to continue to protect important waters within the States' own
borders.
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on how
Congress and the administration can work together to invest in
our water infrastructure and protect clean water for
residential, recreation, and environmental uses.
Mr. Chairman, I welcome our agency witnesses here today,
thank you for your continued service, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
[Mrs. Napolitano's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Grace F. Napolitano, a Representative in
Congress from the State of California, and Ranking Member, Subcommittee
on Water Resources and Environment
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding today's hearing on President
Biden's fiscal year 2024 budget and agency priorities.
I first want to thank the agency representatives for attending
today's hearing, especially Assistant Secretary Connor and General
Graham from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps continues to be
a leader in addressing the water resources challenges facing every
corner of this nation, including the apparently-not-so-unique drought
challenges in my region, and I thank you for your service to my
constituents.
Mr. Chairman, annual budget proposals of the administration and
Congressional leaders provide valuable insight into the goals and
priorities of their authors.
Annual budgets provide an objective way to compare and contrast
competing visions for the future of our country and for what we stand
for in representing our constituents.
This year, the contrasts are stark and telling.
The Biden administration's proposal lays out a bold vision to grow
the economy from the bottom up, to invest in cleaner, greener, and more
accessible infrastructure, to create jobs and opportunities for all
people, and to restore and protect our environment.
That is the same vision shared by House Democrats, who, last
Congress, passed the largest infrastructure investments in over a
generation through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation
Reduction Act, as well as other transformational infrastructure
investment bills, such as the fifth bipartisan Water Resources
Development Act (WRDA) in a row.
With each dollar invested and each new WRDA project implemented,
everyday Americans will continue to reap the benefits of these
transformational laws through reduced transportation congestion,
cleaner air and cleaner water, and a safer, more resilient and more
livable environment.
Now, contrast that with dystopian vision of America advanced by my
colleagues on the other side of the aisle.
In just their few months of control of the House, the new majority
has advanced a debt limit proposal that sought to hold hostage the
``full faith and credit'' of our economy while blindly slashing
critical investments in our economy, our infrastructure, and our
quality of life.
For example, the House Republican debt limit proposal would have
slashed funding for the Corps of Engineers by almost 25 percent, which
would have significantly slowed project delivery and delayed the
realization of critical transportation, flood control, and
environmental benefits authorized through annual WRDAs.
The House Republican proposal would have worsened supply chain
delivery challenges, would have left rural and coastal communities more
vulnerable to extreme weather events and flooding, and would have
threatened critical environmental restoration projects, such as those
in the Chesapeake Bay and the Florida Everglades.
But that is only part of the story.
In their few months of control, the new majority has used this
committee to advance a radical, anti-environmental agenda to put
polluters over people and eliminate Clean Water Act protections on over
half of the nation's wetlands and up to 70 percent of the nation's
streams, rivers, and lakes.
Do my colleagues really believe that private property rights always
trump the public good of protecting our rivers, streams, and other
waterbodies for future generations?
Where is the evidence that the same state-by-state, go-it-alone
approach that resulted in rivers catching on fire before enactment of
the Clean Water Act will somehow magically work this time?
And, clearly, my Republican colleagues do not actually want to
empower states because they also continue to push to strip state
authority protecting important waters within a state's own borders.
Again, Mr. Chairman, our priorities and our actions show the
American people a lot about who we are and what is our respective
vision for the future of our country.
I am proud to support President Biden and his efforts to block
House Republicans from holding our economy hostage while blindly
slashing important investments in our nation.
I was proud to vote against the majority's proposals to gut federal
and state protection of our nation's rivers, streams, and wetlands, and
will continue to work to undue the misguided Supreme Court decision on
clean water.
And I will remain a stalwart defender of rational, bipartisan
efforts to reinvest and modernize our nation's infrastructure--
including my hope for a sixth, bipartisan WRDA early next year.
Again, I welcome our agency witnesses here today, thank you for
your continued service, and yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Rouzer. The gentlelady yields back. I see our ranking
member of the full committee is here, if he would like to offer
an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair Rouzer and
Ranking Member Napolitano, for holding this hearing on the
administration's fiscal year 2024 budget request.
Budget hearings are an important opportunity for
authorizers to have a broader discussion about how to support
the Federal agencies we oversee and ensure the resources we
provide line up with priorities and expectations.
House Democrats have consistently supported the work of the
Army Corps and have a long history of providing the Corps with
the funding it needs to complete the work that we ask of the
agency. We know the Corps carries out projects of high
importance across the U.S. The Corps supports our economy and
supply chains by keeping ports, harbors, and inland waterways
operating smoothly and efficiently. The Corps also constructs
projects that prepare our communities for hurricanes, droughts,
and floods, and protect them from impacts. This work has only
increased in importance as extreme weather events have grown in
frequency and intensity due to climate change.
It is far cheaper to invest in preventive measures than to
recover after the fact.
That is why House Democrats strive to proactively provide
the Corps with the funding it needs to put more WRDA projects
into action.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a prime example of
this. We provided a massive downpayment--a total of about $17
billion--for the ongoing construction of critical WRDA
projects. To its credit, the Corps has shown exactly how and
where they can spend that money--nearly all of it has already
being allocated. These BIL dollars at work are making a
positive impact on water resources infrastructure.
In contrast, the across-the-board cuts of 23 percent
proposed by the Republican leadership to nondefense spending
during the debt limit negotiations would have brought many WRDA
projects to a grinding halt.
For the Corps specifically, a 23-percent cut meant $2
billion of cuts based on fiscal year 2023 appropriations,
including a $40 million cut to the investigations account,
which would have otherwise been used to generate more than 10
feasibility studies, and a more than $1 billion cut to Corps
operations and maintenance work, which literally keeps our
economy afloat.
Fortunately, these chaotic outcomes were avoided when we
passed the Bipartisan Budget Agreement. The more modest 1-
percent cuts agreed to within the bill are surely a relief to
agencies across the Government. But now the House should keep
its word, instead of turn its back, on that agreement.
Congress can and should provide the Corps with more dollars
to implement projects authorized in WRDA bills. I hope the
appropriators hear us on that. With all that we continuously
require and expect of this agency, we need to support it with
funding that allows the Corps to do the job that we ask it to
do and execute the work that benefits communities across the
country.
So, I want to thank the witnesses for joining us today, and
I look forward to your testimony.
[Mr. Larsen of Washington's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen, a Representative in Congress
from the State of Washington, and Ranking Member, Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure

Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back. Because I basically
introduced each of you in my opening statement, just a couple
of housekeeping items here before we get to it.
Obviously, we have a lighting system. Green is go, yellow
is beware, red is right around the corner.
And to my colleagues on the committee--and I am guilty of
this from time to time--try not to ask a question with 1 second
left.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Rouzer. I ask unanimous consent that the witnesses'
full statements be included in the record.
Without objection, so ordered.
As your written testimony has been made part of the record,
the subcommittee asks that you limit your oral remarks to 5
minutes.
With that, Assistant Secretary Connor, you are recognized
for your 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. MICHAEL L. CONNOR, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE
ARMY FOR CIVIL WORKS, DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY; MAJOR GENERAL
WILLIAM H. ``BUTCH'' GRAHAM, DEPUTY CHIEF OF ENGINEERS AND
DEPUTY COMMANDING GENERAL, U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS;
JEFFREY J. LYASH, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,
TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY; AND ADAM TINDALL-SCHLICHT,

CORPORATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

TESTIMONY OF HON. MICHAEL L. CONNOR, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE
ARMY FOR CIVIL WORKS, DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY

Mr. Connor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, Ranking Member
Larsen, and distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank
you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss the
President's fiscal year 2024 budget.
As you know, the Army Civil Works program serves three main
missions: flood and storm damage reduction, commercial
navigation, and aquatic ecosystem restoration. And it supports
related project purposes such as water supply, hydropower, and
recreation. The 2024 budget requests includes over $7.4 billion
for the Army Civil Works program, which is the largest request
in history, complemented by an additional $1.05 billion from
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
These investments demonstrate President Biden's ongoing
commitment to funding the construction of critical
infrastructure projects that strengthen our economy, protect
people and property, and restore key ecosystems.
The water resources challenges of today are not like those
of yesterday. Weather extremes are increasingly the norm, so,
understanding vulnerabilities and increasing our preparedness
is of the utmost importance. For that reason, the budget
proposes $86 million, the largest request in the Corps'
history, for research and development. The focus of this work
will be on innovative solutions that address the emerging water
resources challenges of the 21st century and achieve cost
savings in the Civil Works program. The budget focuses on the
highest performing work within the three main missions of the
Civil Works program.
In developing the budget, consideration was also given to
advancing three key objectives for the administration: one,
decreasing climate risks for communities and the environment;
two, promoting environmental justice in underserved and Tribal
communities; and three, strengthening the Nation's supply
chains.
First, the Corps has always been in the resilience
business, and climate-focused investments include more than
$1.4 billion for the construction of flood and storm damage
reduction and aquatic ecosystem restoration projects.
Second, the budget supports the administration's Justice40
initiative through investments in 23 studies and construction
of 33 projects to help disadvantaged and Tribal communities
address their water resources challenges.
Priority three: the budget facilitates safe, reliable, and
sustainable commercial navigation to support U.S.
competitiveness and improve the resilience of our Nation's
manufacturing supply chains supporting American jobs and the
economy.
The administration's commitment to our coastal ports and
inland waterways is represented by over $3.4 billion for inland
and coastal navigation projects, including $1.7 billion derived
from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund.
Deeper in the construction budget, it provides $653 million
for aquatic ecosystem restoration, including $450 million to
continue restoring America's Everglades and $67 million to
support salmon recovery efforts in the Columbia River Basin.
Other significant construction activity includes $655
million for dam safety activity at Prado Dam in California,
$350 million to replace the Cape Cod Canal bridges, and $235
million to continue the construction of the Soo locks projects.
In total, 2024 construction is funded at more than $2 billion.
In addition to these new projects, the budget invests in
O&M in the Corps' existing infrastructure and improving
reliability and performance by providing over $4.4 billion in
the O&M account. Investigations and recreation are also
provided significant funding, as set forth in my statement. And
the regulatory program is robustly funded at $221 million to
support the administration's priority on permitting activities.
Summarizing, the budget makes critical investments that
will benefit the American people and promote greater prosperity
and economic growth for decades to come.
I will conclude by addressing the definition of waters of
the United States, a topic that you have just identified,
Chairman, as very important to you and the committee as a
whole.
For 50 years, the Clean Water Act, arguably the most
successful environmental law enacted to date, has been the
foundation for remarkable progress in restoring water quality
in rivers, streams, and wetlands across the Nation. While I was
disappointed with the recent decision by the Supreme Court, we
are nonetheless working closely with EPA to develop a new rule
to amend the waters of the United States definition, the rule
that was published in the Federal Register on January 18, 2023.
This new rule will be consistent with the Supreme Court's May
25 decision in the case of Sackett v. EPA. We are already hard
at work, and based on the significant work completed in January
already, we are in a position to issue this final rule
expeditiously.
Thank you for the opportunity. I look forward to your
questions.
[Ms. Connor's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Michael L. Connor, Assistant Secretary of
the Army for Civil Works, Department of the Army
Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, and distinguished
members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here
today to discuss the President's Budget request for the Army Civil
Works program.
The Fiscal Year 2024 Budget request includes over $7.4 billion for
the Army Civil Works program--which is the largest request in history--
complemented by an additional $1.05 billion from the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act--or IIJA. These investments demonstrate
President Biden's ongoing commitment to funding the construction of
critical infrastructure projects that will strengthen our economy,
protect people and property, and restore key ecosystems. It will also
create good paying jobs that provide the free and fair chance to join a
union and collectively bargain. Overall, we believe in smart
investments that yield high economic and environmental returns, while,
also reducing deficits and improving our country's long-term fiscal
outlook.
It's important to note that the water resources challenges of today
and tomorrow are not like those of the past. Weather extremes are
increasingly the norm, creating risk to communities, the economy, and
natural systems. As a result, understanding vulnerabilities and
increasing our preparedness is of paramount importance. For that
reason, the Budget provides $86 million--the largest request in Corps'
history--for research and development. The focus of this work will be
on innovative solutions that will help achieve significant cost savings
in the civil works program and address the emerging water resources
challenges of the 21st Century, including climate change.
The Army Civil Works Budget focuses on the highest performing work
within the three main missions of the Civil Works program:

commercial navigation,

flood and storm damage reduction, and

aquatic ecosystem restoration.

In developing the Budget, consideration was also given to advancing
three key objectives that reflect the Administration's priorities: 1)
decreasing climate risk for communities and increasing ecosystem
resilience to climate change based on the best available science; 2)
promoting environmental justice in underserved and marginalized
communities and Tribal Nations in line with the Justice40 Initiative;
and 3) strengthening the supply chain.
With respect to the first Administration priority, climate-focused
investments include more than $1.4 billion for construction of flood
and storm damage reduction and aquatic ecosystem restoration projects,
over $64 million to improve climate resiliency and/or sustainability at
existing Corps-owned projects, and $35.5 million for technical and
planning assistance programs with an emphasis on actions to help local
communities identify, understand, and address their flood risks
including work that will directly benefit disadvantaged communities by
improving their resilience to climate change. The Budget also funds the
continuation of studies to investigate climate resilience along the
Great Lakes coastlines as well as in Central and Southern Florida.
For priority two, the Budget supports the Administration's
Justice40 Initiative through investments in 23 studies, and in the
construction of 33 projects to help disadvantaged and tribal
communities address their water resources challenges--including funding
for the Tribal Partnership Program. The Army is committed to helping to
achieve the broader goals of the Administration regarding equity and
environmental justice and will continue to improve outreach and access
to Civil Works information and resources, including technical and
planning assistance programs; maximizing the reach of Civil Works
projects to benefit disadvantaged communities; and, ensuring that
updates to Civil Works policies and guidance will not result in a
disproportionate negative impact on disadvantaged communities.
Supply chains remain a priority, which Civil Works supports through
its Commercial Navigation program. The Budget facilitates safe,
reliable and sustainable commercial navigation to support U.S.
competitiveness and improve the resilience of our nation's
manufacturing supply chain to support American jobs and the economy. In
support of the Administration's commitment to our nation's coastal
ports and inland waterways, the FY 2024 Budget includes over $3.4
billion for the study, design, construction, operation and maintenance
(O&M) of inland and coastal navigation projects. Of this amount, over
$1.7 billion is derived from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for
eligible projects with an emphasis on operation and maintenance,
including dredging, of completed projects and over $1 billion will be
used to maintain and improve navigation on the inland waterways.
Flood and storm damage reduction is at the center of the Civil
Works program's actions to support the Administration's goal of
tackling the climate crisis. Accordingly, the Budget contains nearly $2
billion for flood and storm damage reduction, including funding to
provide technical and planning assistance to local communities to
enable them to understand and better manage their flood risks. The
Budget proposes to assist these local efforts, with emphasis on non-
structural approaches.
Equally important to building community resilience is the work of
the aquatic ecosystem restoration (AER) mission. The Budget includes
$653 million for AER, including $415 million for the South Florida
Ecosystem Restoration (SFER) program, which will enable significant
progress in restoring America's Everglades while building ecosystem
resilience to climate change in South Florida. The Budget also includes
$93 million to support salmon recovery efforts in the Columbia River
basin, another priority within the AER program.
Other significant initiatives include $655 million for construction
of a critical dam safety project at Prado Dam, and $350 million for
replacement of the Cape Cod Canal Bridges. Additionally, to facilitate
action on Cape Cod, the Budget includes a legislative proposal that
would allow the Corps to transfer funds to the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts to design and construct the replacement bridges.
Ultimately, the ownership of these bridges will be conveyed to
Massachusetts, which will be responsible for future operation and
maintenance. Also, of significant note, the Budget includes $235
million to continue construction of the Sault Ste. Marie (Replacement
Lock) project in Michigan.
In total, the FY 2024 Construction program is funded at more than
$2 billion. While most of this funding is in the Construction account,
over $37 million is in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund account, and
nearly $64 million is in the Mississippi River and Tributaries account.
By significantly increasing funding of construction for crucial
infrastructure projects, this budget will help us get things done and
ensure momentum on much needed infrastructure improvements across the
nation. The Army also has allocated the $50 million provided for
construction in 2024 in the IIJA for shore protection projects that
will support coastal communities and improve their resilience to storm
and climate change impacts.
As I wrap up the discussion on construction, I want to acknowledge
that there is no funding proposed from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund
(IWTF) in this year's budget in view of the $2.5 billion made available
in the IIJA for construction, replacement, rehabilitation, and
expansion of inland waterways projects. The IWTF is a very valuable
funding source, and I anticipate there will be ongoing and significant
use in the future beyond the investments provided by the IIJA.
Of course, in addition to new projects, the Budget focuses on
maintaining the key features of the vast water resources infrastructure
that the Corps owns and manages, and on finding innovative ways to
rehabilitate it or divest of it to others. The Budget invests in
operating and maintaining the Corps' existing infrastructure and
improving its reliability and performance. Specifically, the FY 2024
Budget funds the Operation and Maintenance program at over $4.4
billion, consisting of over $2.6 billion in the Operation and
Maintenance account, nearly $1.7 billion in the Harbor Maintenance
Trust Fund account, and nearly $154 million in Mississippi River and
Tributaries account. The allocation of funding among projects for
maintenance reflects a risk-informed approach that considers both
project and project component conditions and the potential consequences
of a failure. The Budget also gives priority to the maintenance of
coastal ports and inland waterways with the highest commercial traffic.
Additionally, the Budget is complemented by $1 billion for operation
and maintenance in 2024 from the IIJA.
For the Investigations program, the FY 2024 Budget provides $139
million, consisting of nearly $130 million from the Investigations
account and over $9 million in Mississippi River and Tributaries.
Within those amounts, the Budget includes $35.5 million for technical
and planning assistance programs. These programs help local
communities, including disadvantaged communities, identify and address
their flood risks, including flood risks associated with climate
change.
Continuing with the budget summary, it's significant that the FY
2024 Regulatory Program is funded at $221 million to protect the
nation's waters and wetlands and provide efficiency in permit
processing. And the Recreation program is funded at $275 million to
ensure the Corps--one of the nation's leading Federal providers of
outdoor recreation--can continue to effectively serve the public's
desire to experience the great outdoors.
To summarize, the Budget makes critical investments in water
resources that will benefit the American people and promote greater
prosperity and economic growth for decades to come. From solving water
resources challenges facing communities, to nurturing sustainable
aquatic ecosystems, the Corps is delivering on its mission to serve the
public.
I am very honored to implement the President's priorities for the
Army Civil Works program and excited to be a part of a great team--
serving our Nation.
Thank you for inviting me here today. I look forward to your
questions.

Mr. Rouzer. Major General Graham.

TESTIMONY OF MAJOR GENERAL WILLIAM H. ``BUTCH'' GRAHAM, DEPUTY
CHIEF OF ENGINEERS AND DEPUTY COMMANDING GENERAL, U.S. ARMY
CORPS OF ENGINEERS

General Graham. Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano,
Ranking Member Larsen, and distinguished members of the
subcommittee, I am honored to testify before you today, and
thank you for the opportunity to discuss the fiscal year 2024
budget request for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
I look forward to answering the subcommittee's questions on
the status of the Corps' projects and programs. Most
importantly, I look forward to continuing to work with this
committee, Congress, and the administration to address the
Nation's critical water resources infrastructure needs.
I thank the subcommittee for supporting the Corps Civil
Works program. Your commitment since 2014 to passing biennial
Water Resources Development Acts has provided us with the
authorities necessary to address the changing needs of the
Nation's water resources infrastructure.
An example, in WRDA 2022, Congress authorized 25 new
construction projects, 94 new feasibility studies, and 131 new
environmental infrastructure projects. These studies and
projects, when funded, will strengthen the supply chain,
address the climate crisis, advance environmental justice,
invest in Tribes, and provide needed water resources projects
to traditionally underserved communities.
Looking a bit closer, WRDA 2022, it provides enhanced
flexibilities for the Corps to address our changing climate,
including observed sea level rise, increased frequency and
magnitude of river flooding, and historic extremes in
precipitation and drought. Such provisions allow the Corps to
respond more comprehensively to coastal and inland flooding
during the planning phase of new projects and during the repair
and restoration of existing projects.
Furthermore, the legislation underscores congressional
intent in increasing the Corps' role in drought resiliency by,
for example, expanding the use of forecast-informed reservoir
operations.
The 2024 budget and other recent funding, combined with
WRDA legislation, provides the Corps with what Mr. Connor calls
transformational opportunities to deliver water resources
infrastructure projects that will positively impact communities
across the Nation. To take advantage of this opportunity, the
Army Corps is focused on three main areas.
First and foremost, we are focused on delivery. We maintain
a sense of urgency to safely deliver quality projects on
schedule and within budget. We are making any and all changes
necessary to ensure we deliver and are not late to need. The
task force we are standing up in Puerto Rico is a good example
of this transformation in action.
Secondly, we recognize the importance of our partnerships,
starting with our non-Federal sponsors, and the communities and
the States we work in and are a part of. We need to listen
better, not just at the DC level, but at the local project
level, where it matters the most. We need to listen better to
our industry partners, unleashing the creativity and talents of
the private sector. Under Mr. Connor's guidance, we are working
hard to listen better to Tribal nations and other underserved
groups. The four new committees authorized in WRDA 2022 will
help ensure that all voices are heard.
And finally, we are focused on innovation. Meeting the
challenges of climate change, addressing water supply and water
conservation needs, addressing the needs of the underserved
communities, and modernizing our infrastructure needed to
maintain our economic edge all demand innovation.
I will conclude by saying that we value deeply the
authorities you have entrusted in us. Our pledge is to put them
to work to deliver for the American people.
And thank you, Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano,
and Ranking Member Larsen. I look forward to answering your
questions.
[General Graham's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Major General William H. ``Butch'' Graham, Deputy
Chief of Engineers and Deputy Commanding General, U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers
Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, and distinguished
members of the Subcommittee. I am honored to testify before you today
along with the Honorable Michael Connor, Assistant Secretary of the
Army for Civil Works, regarding the President's Fiscal Year 2024 (FY
2024) Budget (Budget) for the Army Civil Works Program and our
implementation of the Water Resources Development Act of 2022 (WRDA
2022).
Through the Army Civil Works program, the United States Army Corps
of Engineers (Corps) works with other Federal agencies, States, Tribes,
and local governments, as well as others, to develop, manage, restore,
and protect water resources, primarily through the study, construction,
and operation and maintenance of water-related infrastructure projects.
The Corps also regulates development affecting waters of the United
States including wetlands and works with other Federal agencies to help
communities respond to, and recover from, floods and other natural
disasters.
For FY 2024, the President recommended $7.413 billion in
discretionary funding for Civil Works activities--the largest budget
request in the history of this program. This funding, along with the
authorizations provided to us by Congress, will allow us to advance our
three main missions of commercial navigation, flood and storm damage
reduction, and aquatic ecosystem restoration, as well as support
related project purposes, such as water supply, hydropower, and
recreation. The Civil Works program is performance-based and focuses on
high-performing projects and programs within these three main mission
areas. The Corps uses its engineering expertise and relationships with
project sponsors and stakeholders to develop innovative approaches to
address some of the most pressing water resources challenges facing the
Nation.
WRDA 2022 provided the Corps the flexibility to design projects
that respond to a wider suite of impacts associated with climate
change. WRDA 2022 also provided flexibility to address the water
resources needs of urban and rural communities with environmental
justice concerns. This is a high priority goal of the Administration.
An important next step for Army Civil Works will be the adoption of
procedures implementing the Water Resources Principles, Requirements,
and Guidelines. In partnership with the Assistant Secretary for Army
for Civil Works, we expect to formally initiate a rulemaking process on
this issue later this year. This rulemaking will include a focus on
securing environmental justice and spurring economic opportunity for
disadvantaged communities that have been historically marginalized,
underserved, or overburdened by pollution, and may have been left
behind in the past in terms of infrastructure development.
The Corps Tribal Nations Program enables the Army to partner with
Federally recognized American Indian and Alaskan Native tribal
governments to identify solutions to their water resources challenges,
which will substantially benefit the people who live in Indian Country
or in Alaska Native villages. The Corps works with Native American
Tribes as cost-share partners on Civil Works projects through its
Tribal Partnership Program, under its Planning Assistance to States
Program, as well as through specifically authorized Civil Works
projects. WRDA 2022 supports our trust commitment to Tribal Nations by
enhancing the breadth and reach of the Tribal Partnership Program,
strengthening tools to provide Tribal assistance, as well as
establishing a framework for an advisory committee to further
facilitate delivery of water resources projects to Tribal Nations. The
Corps reaffirms its commitment to engage in regular, meaningful, and
robust consultation with Tribal officials in the development of water
resources projects and on regulatory actions that have Tribal
implications.
In developing the FY 2024 Budget, the Administration gave
consideration to projects that reduced climate risk to communities. For
example, to advance community resilience, the Budget provided
construction funding for Environmental Infrastructure and the Tribal
Partnership Program. This is the first time that the Budget provided
such funding. The Budget also includes $35.5 million for our planning
and technical assistance programs, where the Corps shares its expertise
with local communities, including economically disadvantaged
communities, to help them identify and understand their water resources
problems and increase their resilience to, and preparedness for, flood
risks.
Through the Army Civil Works research and development program, we
are making investments to tackle future water resources challenges and
advance related technological development in support of the three Army
Civil Works main missions. The Budget includes a historic $86 million
investment in research and development activities, or over $100 million
including technology transition and data collection. This investment
demonstrates the Administration's commitment to engineering innovation
to deliver enduring water resource solutions for the Nation. This
investment will allow the Corps to continue addressing the most
pressing knowledge gaps that our practitioners face while doing their
jobs in the field, such as operational, data-driven methods to improve
navigation channel maintenance, the beneficial use of dredged material,
and flood and storm risk management modeling. This investment also
includes funding to advance longer-term research and development
including: $10 million to accelerate the Forecast-Informed Reservoir
Operations Assessment, which will further our understanding of
atmospheric river impacts on flood risk management, water supply, and
other water uses; and $25.5 million to inform and improve our overall
asset management strategy, with a focus on work that has the potential
to achieve significant cost savings in the Civil Works program.
The FY 2024 Budget reflects a number of other priorities of the
Administration. The Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration program is funded at
$653 million in the Budget, investing in the restoration of some of the
Nation's most unique aquatic ecosystems, such as the Chesapeake Bay,
the Upper Mississippi River, the Great Lakes, the Louisiana Coast, and
the Everglades. This includes $415 million for the South Florida
Ecosystem Restoration (SFER) (Everglades) program--which is an $8
million increase compared to the 2023 Budget level, as well as $93
million to support salmon recovery efforts in the Columbia River basin.
The FY 2024 Budget includes $235 million for the Sault Ste. Marie
(Replacement Lock) project in Michigan and $350 million for replacement
of the Cape Cod Canal Bridges in Massachusetts along with a legislative
proposal that would allow the Corps to transfer funds to the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts to design and construct the replacement
bridges. The largest request in the Construction Account is $655
million for the construction of a critical dam safety project at Prado
Dam in California.
The FY 2024 Budget also includes five new studies in the
Investigations account--Klamath Basin, CA (Aquatic Ecosystem
Restoration); Southeast Michigan, MI (Flood Risk Management);
Tittabawassee River, Chippewa River, Pine River and Tobacco River, MI
(Flood Risk Management); Fox Point Hurricane Barrier, RI (Flood Damage
Reduction Coastal); and, Morgantown, WV Lock and Dam Automation.
My top priorities include identifying the highest priority
potential investments for the Army Civil Works Program, starting with
the maintenance of our existing infrastructure, and ensuring that we
deliver studies and finish quality projects safely, on time, and within
budget. I am focused on delivering projects that will contribute to the
effort to enhance the Nation's resilience to climate change. These
priorities will ensure a better return on taxpayer investment and
improve the lives of all Americans.
The FY 2024 President's Budget for the Army Civil Works Program
represents a continuing, fiscally prudent investment in the Nation's
water resources infrastructure and restoration of aquatic ecosystems.
The Corps is committed to efficiently and effectively executing the
Army Civil Works program.
Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and Members of the Subcommittee. This
concludes my statement. I appreciate the opportunity to testify today
and look forward to answering any questions you may have. Thank you.

Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Lyash.

TESTIMONY OF JEFFREY J. LYASH, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY

Mr. Lyash. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member
Napolitano, and subcommittee members for allowing me to
represent the more than 10,000 employees and 20,000 contract
partners who deliver on the Tennessee Valley Authority's
mission of service.
TVA was established, as was said, 90 years ago on a clear
mission to benefit the public good across the Tennessee Valley
region by providing energy, economic development, and
environmental stewardship. Today, TVA remains focused on the
large-scale challenges that our Nation and region face: meeting
rising energy demand, growing American manufacturing and our
economy, reducing energy burden for families, mitigating
climate change, and addressing growing cybersecurity threats.
We are actively investing in the next generation of
technologies to ensure that we maintain our Nation's energy
security while expanding our asset portfolio to include
additional, affordable, reliable, and clean resources for the
future.
In terms of energy, TVA is the Nation's largest public
power provider and the third largest power producer overall.
Our service territory is one of the fastest growing in the
Nation, covering portions of seven States in the Tennessee
Valley geographic area. TVA partners with 153 local power
companies and 58 directly served customers to support the
communities and the people of the region, and our customers
include 7 military and Federal installations.
We are proud of our mission to support national security by
producing tritium to support the Nation's defense program.
We operate one of the Nation's most diverse, cleanest
generation portfolios, including nuclear, hydro, solar, and
gas. We also operate one of the Nation's largest transmission
systems.
TVA operates through revenues primarily from our electric
power generation system. We receive no appropriations, and we
work hard to maintain the lowest rates feasible for our
customers, guided by least-cost planning mandates. TVA
currently has approximately $12.5 billion in annual revenues
and an asset base of more than $51 billion.
For nearly a decade now, we have followed a disciplined
financial plan to reduce TVA's debt. TVA's total financial
obligations are at the lowest level in more than 30 years. TVA
debt is not guaranteed by the United States and does not count
against the U.S. Treasury's debt limit.
TVA's low rates and our historically high reliability are
energizing new jobs and investment across the region. TVA
partnerships helped our service territory create or retain
nearly 350,000 jobs and attract almost $49 billion in projected
capital investment in just the past 5 years.
Because of TVA's economic development mission, we must
operate as efficiently and effectively as the best investor-
owned utilities to remain competitive in attracting new
business. Population, economic and industrial growth, and
expanded electrification are creating sustained regional load
growth. We anticipate needing at least 50 to 100 percent more
energy than we currently produce by 2050.
TVA already is a national leader in carbon reduction.
Currently, more than half of TVA's produced energy is carbon
free, and our goal is to reach net zero. TVA is dramatically
expanding our solar generation, actively working toward 10,000
new megawatts. We have an industry-leading nuclear fleet and
have a path to extend the lifetime of those units. We have a
global leadership position in advanced nuclear generation,
working with domestic and international partners to develop
standard small modular reactor design that can be deployed by
TVA.
Other carbon-free energy innovation investments include
partnership in a Southeast Hydrogen Hub coalition and TVA's
first grid-scale energy storage facility. And we will share all
these technologies and best practices.
At our roots, TVA is one of the Nation's vital river
management and flood control agencies. We manage one of the
country's largest river systems, the 652-mile Tennessee River
system, which averts flood damage and promotes economic
development.
One of the enduring legacies of TVA's 90-year history of
service is that we continually seek to increase the value we
deliver to those that we serve.
Thank you, and I am happy to answer the committee's
questions.
[Mr. Lyash's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Jeffrey J. Lyash, President and Chief Executive
Officer, Tennessee Valley Authority
Our Mission of Service: Improve Quality of Life
Thank you Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, and members
of the subcommittee for allowing me to represent the more than 10,000
employees and 20,000 contract partners who deliver on the Tennessee
Valley Authority's mission of service every day. I am Jeff Lyash,
President and Chief Executive Officer of TVA.
TVA was established 90 years ago, as part of the New Deal, to
improve the quality of life for the citizens of the Tennessee Valley
region by providing energy, economic development, and environmental
stewardship. TVA met that mission of service through river management
and flood control, harnessing the power of water to electrify rural
areas and bring in new industries and opportunity.
Today, TVA remains focused on the large-scale challenges that our
nation and region face: meeting rising energy demand, growing American
manufacturing and our economy, reducing energy burden on American
families, mitigating climate change, and addressing growing
cybersecurity threats.
Given these challenges and the scale of TVA's operations today, our
mission will be critical in the decades ahead. We are actively
investing in the next generation of technologies to ensure that we
maintain our nation's energy security while expanding our asset
portfolio to include additional affordable, reliable, and clean
resources for the future. It is an honor to share how we are serving
the people of the Tennessee Valley region, and the entire nation,
today, and our efforts to do so in the future.
In terms of energy, TVA is the nation's largest public power
provider and the third-largest overall power producer. Our service
territory is one of the fastest growing in the nation--covering
portions of seven states in the Tennessee Valley geographic area. We
supply electricity for more than 10 million people--and that population
is growing at six times the national average.
TVA partners with 153 local power companies and 58 directly served
customers to support the communities and people of the region. Our
customers include seven military and federal installations.
We are proud of our mission to support national security by
producing tritium to support the nation's nuclear defense program.
We operate one of the nation's most diverse, cleanest generation
portfolios, including nuclear, hydro, and solar. We also operate one of
the nation's largest transmission systems.
TVA has an impressive history of 90 years of service, and we are
well-positioned to continue to be a leader in energy, environmental
stewardship, and economic development for decades to come. Today, I
will focus on that future and the ways in which TVA is serving the
Tennessee Valley region and the entire nation.
Maintaining Affordability and Fiscal Discipline
TVA operates through revenues primarily from our electric power
generation system. The TVA power system has been self-funded since
1959. We are not part of the regular appropriations process. We have a
statutory least cost planning mandate, and we work hard to maintain the
lowest rates feasible for our customers while investing in the
reliability and resiliency of our system.
In 2014, TVA fulfilled a requirement to repay $1 billion of early
government investment. Beyond that $1 billion repayment, we continue to
pay the U.S. Treasury a return on the government's remaining permanent
investment in TVA. This totaled $4 million to $6 million annually from
2020 to 2022. We also return 5% of power revenues to states and
counties as tax equivalent payments--totaling $5.3 billion in the past
10 years.
TVA currently has approximately $12.5 billion in annual revenues
and an asset base of more than $51 billion. For nearly a decade now, we
have followed a disciplined financial plan to reduce TVA's debt. TVA's
total financing obligations are at the lowest level in more than 30
years. Pursuant to the TVA Act, TVA debt is not guaranteed by the
United States and does not count against the U.S. Treasury's debt
limit.
We have reduced our total financial obligations by $7 billion from
$27.5 billion in Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 to $20.3 billion in FY 2022. We
accomplished this while making ongoing annual investments of billions
of dollars in TVA system assets and upgrades.
Because of TVA's economic development mission, we must operate as
efficiently and effectively as the best investor-owned utilities to
remain competitive in attracting new businesses.
Through our public power model, we are one of the nation's lowest
cost power producers. Our residential retail rate is 25th lowest among
the top 100 utilities in the nation as of February 2023. Our industrial
rate is 7th lowest among the top 100 utilities. TVA base electric rates
have remained stable for four consecutive years. Additionally, we
provided $1.2 billion in pandemic and long-term partner credits to our
customers through quarter two of FY 2023.
We are also addressing energy burden through our energy efficiency
programs, such as home and industrial energy efficiency audits, Home
Uplift energy upgrades, School Uplift energy upgrades, and creating a
network of regional weatherization contractors to assist homeowners.
TVA's low rates and our historically high reliability are
energizing new jobs and investment across the region. TVA helped our
service territory create or retain nearly 350,000 jobs and attract
almost $48 billion in projected capital investment in the past five
years. One of the major reasons industries and businesses choose the
Tennessee Valley region is because of the affordable, reliable,
resilient, and clean energy TVA provides.
TVA economic development partnerships have resulted in several of
the largest projects in the history of our region, including the recent
Ford BlueOval City campus in west Tennessee ($5.6 billion investment);
General Motors Co. and LG Energy Solution in Spring Hill, Tennessee
($2.3 billion investment); and First Solar in north Alabama ($1.1
billion investment). Our region is rapidly becoming the electric
vehicle and battery production center of the United States. We are
partnering with our communities to create or keep advanced
manufacturing jobs in the United States. TVA energy also powers tech
hubs for Amazon, Facebook, Google, and others.
Building the Energy System of the Future to Enable the New Industrial
Age
TVA's commitment is to provide our seven-state region with energy
security--the affordable, reliable, resilient, and clean energy that
communities and customers across the region expect and deserve. We are
focused on energy expansion and innovation as we meet today's needs,
while also preparing for the future. We appreciate that the Inflation
Reduction Act included direct pay tax incentive provisions for public
power providers and TVA to help ensure parity across the electric
utility system and create opportunities for all consumers.
Population, economic, and industrial growth, and expanded
electrification are creating sustained regional load growth. We
anticipate needing at least 50-100% more energy than we currently
produce by 2050 if the region sees strong electrification and continued
economic growth.
TVA is currently working to expand and upgrade our energy system to
meet anticipated future power load and transmission demands in the face
of ongoing economic growth and increasing electrification. This
includes currently building more than 3,800 megawatts of combustion
turbine and combined cycle natural gas generation, new solar and energy
storage.
We are also working to make our system more robust and resilient
against cyber threats, climate change, and more intense and frequent
extreme weather events. Since Winter Storm Elliott in 2022, we have
taken more than 250 actions to harden assets to resist extreme weather.
TVA is also investing $2.8 billion in transmission system improvements,
including our new state-of-the-art Primary Systems Operations Center in
Meigs County, Tennessee. This $300 million center will use smart
technologies to help manage the flow of electricity across the 80,000-
square-mile area we serve, around the clock, minute-by-minute.
TVA's energy will be increasingly carbon-free in the future. TVA
already is a national leader in carbon reduction, operating the
cleanest energy system in the Southeast. Currently, more than half of
TVA-produced energy is carbon-free. And our goal is to reach net-zero
by 2050.
TVA is dramatically expanding our solar generation, actively
working toward 10,000 new megawatts. We are currently implementing
projects from the industry's largest clean energy request for proposal.
We have an industry leading nuclear fleet and have a path to extend
the lifetime of those units.
TVA is actively investing in energy innovation. We have a global
leadership position in advanced nuclear generation through a
partnership with Ontario Power Generation, Synthos Green Energy, and GE
Hitachi Nuclear Energy to develop a standard small modular reactor
design that can be deployed by TVA, nationally and internationally to
further a secure and low-carbon energy future. This partnership defrays
the costs of development and deployment of small modular reactors from
any one organization, allowing us to go further, faster in developing
this clean energy technology.
TVA holds the nation's first Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)-
issued early site permit for small modular reactors at our Clinch River
site near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. While we are continuing site work at
Clinch River, we are also beginning evaluation of additional small
modular reactor locations across our region.
To diversify our carbon-free energy innovation investments, TVA is
a partner in a Southeast Hydrogen Hub coalition of five major Southeast
utility companies. This partnership has submitted a full application
for Department of Energy funding to develop a regional ecosystem to
deploy green hydrogen as a carbon-reduction solution for customers and
communities.
We have invested in advanced grid-scale energy storage through our
first TVA battery storage facility in Vonore, Tennessee, expected to be
operational later this year.
TVA has also partnered with the Department of Energy's Water Power
Technologies Office to evaluate and demonstrate different approaches
for operating our hydropower units to meet our electric grid's changing
needs.
TVA will be on the leading edge of technology advancements, and we
will share best practices and lessons learned from our energy
innovations, benefiting the entire energy industry. We are partnering
to leverage federal expertise such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory, as
well as other renowned resources such as the Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI), and the University of Tennessee and other academic
institutions.
We will continue to pursue partnerships and opportunities that will
advance energy innovation and security that benefit all Americans and
serve the people of the Tennessee Valley region. Our new nuclear
innovations are also a strategic advantage to our allies as we
collaborate internationally.
Stewarding our Natural Resources
At our roots, TVA is one of the nation's vital river management and
flood control agencies. We manage one of the country's largest river
systems--the 652-mile Tennessee River and its tributaries. We operate a
system of 49 dams and reservoirs. Through our management, we have
prevented nearly $10 billion in flood damage to communities across the
Tennessee Valley during our history. Additionally, we have helped avert
approximately $778 million in additional flood damage to downstream
lower Ohio River and Mississippi River basin communities by working in
partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during extreme
events.
TVA's system of dams and reservoirs makes us one of the largest
stewards of public lands and waters in the eastern United States. Our
dam system provides recreation and tourism opportunities for numerous
cities, towns, and counties that count on this estimated $11.9 billion
annual revenue stream.
TVA also protects the unique biodiversity of our region and
enhances waterways, natural resources, and cultural resources through
our expansive stewardship programs. TVA's Biodiversity Policy states
that TVA will protect biodiversity through its stewardship of public
lands, management of the Tennessee River system, local and regional
partnerships, and integration of species and habitat conservation in
project planning. In FY 2022, TVA completed 120 biodiversity projects
and initiatives comprised of on-the-ground conservation, monitoring and
research, and education and outreach.
Conclusion
One of the enduring legacies of TVA's 90 years of service is that
we continually seek to increase the value we deliver to those we serve.
TVA was built to tackle energy challenges, create and share innovation,
and be a catalyst for growth. We are uniquely positioned to lead in
meeting our country's expanding energy needs and industrial growth.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman.
Mr. Tindall-Schlicht, you have 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF ADAM TINDALL-SCHLICHT, ADMINISTRATOR, GREAT LAKES
ST. LAWRENCE SEAWAY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
TRANSPORTATION

Mr. Tindall-Schlicht. Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member
Napolitano, Ranking Member Larsen, and members of the
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity today to present
the President's fiscal year 2024 budget request for the Great
Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation.
The mission of the GLS is to operate and maintain the U.S.
infrastructure and waterways of the St. Lawrence Seaway, while
also performing trade and economic development activities that
are designed to enhance utilization of the Great Lakes St.
Lawrence Seaway system. The GLS is primarily responsible for
maintaining and operating Eisenhower and Snell locks, located
in Massena, New York, while also controlling commercial vessel
traffic in the U.S. sections of the St. Lawrence River and Lake
Ontario.
Since the seaway opened in 1959, the GLS has directly
served commercial maritime transportation stakeholders by
providing a safe, reliable, and efficient deep-draft
international waterway in cooperation with its Canadian
counterpart, the St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation.
Binational coordination on an ongoing basis is imperative, as a
vessel that transits into the Great Lakes will cross the
international border 27 times while passing through the
waterway's 2 U.S. locks and 13 Canadian locks.
The seaway serves as a vital artery for trade and a key
component of the North American supply chain, supporting
economic development while ensuring the efficient movement of
goods between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. This also
enhances the United States defense capabilities and
international cooperation.
More than 3 billion tons of cargo valued at over $500
billion has transited through the seaway over its 65-year
history. During the 2022 navigation season, more than 36
million tons of cargo moved through this binational waterway.
In fulfilling its mission, the GLS produces significant
economic benefits across the Great Lakes region. An economic
study completed in 2018 showed that maritime commerce on the
seaway sustains over 237,000 U.S. and Canadian jobs, $35
billion in economic activity, over $14 billion in personal
income, and over $6 billion in Federal, State, Provincial, and
local taxes on an annual basis.
For fiscal year 2024, the President's budget requests an
appropriation for the GLS of $40.3 million from the Harbor
Maintenance Trust. This budget request includes two programs:
seaway operations and maintenance, as well as seaway
infrastructure. The overall budget request supports the
administration's priorities of safety, job creation, economic
growth, and transformational infrastructure investment.
The 2024 request for seaway operations and maintenance
totals $24 million, providing financial and personnel
resources, allowing us to perform the operational and
administrative functions of the corporation, including lock
operations, marine services, vessel traffic, ballast water
management, safety, security, and environmental inspections, as
well as international trade promotion.
The 2024 request for the seaway infrastructure totals $16.3
million. The locks, channels, and accompanying infrastructure
of the seaway, which is owned and operated by the GLS, are
perpetual transportation assets requiring regular capital
reinvestment, allowing them to continue our record of safety,
reliability, and efficiency.
The United States Congress has supported GLS infrastructure
renewal by investing over $209 million on 62 unique capital
infrastructure projects since 2009. These investments have
resulted in the lowest level of lock delays and vessel safety
incidents on the Great Lakes Seaway in navigation history.
In sum, the fiscal year 2024 budget request will ensure
that the corporation will continue to operate and maintain U.S.
seaway infrastructure, will ensure safe vessel navigation, will
help protect the Great Lakes ecology, will address needed
maintenance, will help rehabilitate and enhance GLS facilities,
and promote economic development throughout the Great Lakes
region.
I am happy to answer any questions, and thank you.
[Mr. Tindall-Schlicht's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Adam Tindall-Schlicht, Administrator, Great Lakes
St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, U.S. Department of
Transportation
Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, and Members of the
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to submit written testimony
for the record regarding the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 budget request for
the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (GLS or
Corporation). I am glad to present this information and to report on
the activities of the GLS.
The GLS is a wholly owned government corporation within the U.S.
Department of Transportation (USDOT) with its funding appropriated
since 1987 from the user fee-based Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund
(HMTF). Since its creation, the GLS has been funded through
appropriations derived from user fees and not from the Treasury's
General Fund. Prior to 1987, the GLS's funding was derived from tolls
to commercial vessels transiting the St. Lawrence Seaway.
The GLS's mission is to operate and maintain the U.S.
infrastructure and waterways of the St. Lawrence Seaway, while
performing trade and economic development activities designed to
enhance the utilization of the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway System.
The GLS is primarily responsible for maintaining and operating
Eisenhower and Snell locks located in Massena, New York, and
controlling commercial vessel traffic in U.S. areas of the St. Lawrence
River and Lake Ontario. A majority of GLS employees are veterans, and
we have a unionized trade workforce, providing quality jobs in upstate
New York. Since the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, the GLS
has directly served commercial marine transportation stakeholders by
providing a safe, reliable, and efficient deep-draft international
waterway, in cooperation with its Canadian counterpart, the St.
Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation (SLSMC).
Over its 65-year history, more than 3 billion metric tons of cargo
valued at more than $500 billion has transited the St. Lawrence Seaway,
including grain, iron ore, iron and steel, project cargoes, and other
raw and bulk commodities. During the 2022 navigation season, more than
36 million metric tons of cargo valued at $13 billion moved through the
binational waterway.\1\ In recent years, international cruise ships
have also been touring U.S. Great Lakes ports via the Seaway in record
numbers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

tonnage2022_12_en.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A vessel entering the St. Lawrence Seaway at Montreal, Canada, and
transiting to Lake Erie crosses the international border 27 times while
passing through the St. Lawrence Seaway's 15 locks (2 U.S. and 13
Canadian). As a consequence of this unique geography, when constructing
the Seaway in 1954, the United States and Canada created a binational
governance approach for the Seaway through an exchange of diplomatic
notes, constituting a binding international agreement between the
countries. It was and remains a bold, optimistic, unique, and effective
governance approach; all other U.S. inland waterways are operated,
maintained, and managed directly by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
and the U.S. Coast Guard. Due to the geography of the St. Lawrence
River and the importance of the sovereignty issues involved, however,
the U.S. and Canadian Governments established a binational framework of
civilian Federal oversight and control of this international waterway,
which today is administered by the GLS and the Canadian SLSMC.
To carry out its mission, the GLS possesses legal authorities that
distinguish it from other operating administrations at the U.S.
Department of Transportation and from most other Executive Branch
agencies. The Wiley-Dondero Act of 1954 (Seaway Act), which created and
permanently authorized the GLS, incorporated authorities that were
first put into law through the Government Corporation Control Act of
1945. The GLS was created as a government corporation to manage this
public infrastructure asset and provide a direct service to customers--
moving vessels safely and efficiently through a binational waterway.
The succinct and plain language of the Corporation's enabling statute
allows sufficient flexibility to manage its operations in a business-
like manner. Some of the distinguishing attributes include the ability
to make and carry out contracts or agreements as necessary to conduct
business as well as the ability to acquire real and personal property
and sell, lease, or dispose of such property. Together with its mission
of providing 24/7 marine transportation services, these legal
authorities help promote a culture within the GLS of accountability and
customer service.
The deep degree of trust and operational cross-border interaction
that has developed between the U.S. and Canadian Seaway entities over
the past six decades helps maintain a transit experience for Seaway
users that is essentially seamless from a vessel captain's perspective.
It is a remarkable achievement given the operational complexities and
multiple jurisdictions that impact that transit.
The St. Lawrence Seaway directly serves an eight-State, two-
province region that accounts for one-quarter of the U.S. gross
domestic product (GDP), one-half of North America's manufacturing and
services industries, and is home to nearly one-quarter of the
continent's population.
The Seaway's importance for national security and the Nation's
transportation supply chain lies in its (a) strategic location
connecting the Great Lakes region of North America to the Atlantic
Ocean, (b) economic significance supporting economic growth, job
creation, and trade, while enabling efficient transportation of goods
and reducing shipping costs and congestion on alternative routes, (c)
role in defense and security in the transportation of goods, equipment,
and supplies necessary for military operations, including the movement
of naval vessels, and (d) supply chain resilience as an alternative
transportation route in the event of disruptions or congestion at other
ports or transportation corridors.
Annual commerce on the Great Lakes Seaway System, including U.S.
flag interlake activity, typically exceeds 180 million metric tons and
serves U.S. farmers, manufacturing workers, miners, and commercial
interests throughout the Great Lakes region. Virtually every type of
bulk and general cargo commodity moves on the Great Lakes Seaway
System, including iron ore for the U.S. steel industry; limestone for
construction and steel industries; grain exports from U.S. farms;
general cargo such as iron and steel products and heavy machinery; and
cement, salt, and stone aggregates for agriculture and industry.
Additionally, the Seaway has emerged as a critical transportation route
for the shipment of large components essential to the wind energy
industry.
Maritime commerce on the Great Lakes Seaway System provides
shippers with nearly $4 billion in annual cost savings compared to the
next least expensive mode of transportation.\2\ The Seaway also
produces significant economic benefits to the Great Lakes region. An
economic impact study completed in 2018 concluded that maritime
commerce on the Great Lakes Seaway System sustains over 237,000 U.S.
and Canadian jobs, $35 billion in economic activity, $14.2 billion in
personal income, and $6.6 billion in federal, state/provincial, and
local taxes each year.\3\ An update to the 2018 study is expected to be
released later this year.

FY 2024 Budget Request
For FY 2024, the President's Budget requests an appropriation of
$40.3 million from the HMTF to fund the GLS's operations and
maintenance of the U.S. portion of the St. Lawrence Seaway, as well as
capital infrastructure projects to rehabilitate and modernize the GLS's
perpetual assets and associated equipment. The request represents an
increase of $1.8 million from the FY 2023 enacted level.
The budget request includes two programs--(1) Seaway Operations and
Maintenance and (2) Seaway Infrastructure, which support the
Administration's priorities of safety, job creation and economic
growth, and transformational infrastructure investments.
The FY 2024 request for the GLS's Seaway Operations and Maintenance
program is $24.0 million to provide the GLS with the financial and
personnel resources necessary to perform its operational, maintenance,
and administrative functions, including lock operations, marine
services, vessel traffic control, asset maintenance, ballast water
management, safety and environmental inspections, and trade promotion
and economic development.
For its Seaway Infrastructure program, the FY 2024 President's
Budget includes a request of $16.3 million for 12 infrastructure-
related capital projects, including $7 million for the replacement of
65-year-old GLS Administration Building, a primary business center for
the Corporation in Massena; $3 million to replace deteriorated and
damaged concrete at Eisenhower Lock and Snell Lock; $1.5 million to
upgrade electrical distribution equipment at the GLS locks and
maintenance facility; and $1.5 million for paving and drainage upgrades
to GLS roadways.
Beginning in FY 2024, the GLS will launch a multi-year effort to
rehabilitate and/or replace its various buildings and facilities in
Massena, N.Y., that are used for both employee workspace and storage
and were built during the construction of the U.S. assets of the St.
Lawrence Seaway in the 1950s. All these facilities/buildings are owned
and operated by the GLS, including the Administration Building. Most of
these buildings/facilities have reached the end of their useful life
and do not meet ADA or energy standards.
In FY 2022, the GLS contracted with an architectural/engineering
firm to establish a facility master plan to include a review of the
entire GLS's Massena building/workplace inventory to assess current
conditions, address needed maintenance and/or rehabilitation to meet
current workplace and energy standards, and provide cost estimates for
new, more energy and space efficient workspaces. The facility master
plan identified 20 capital improvement projects with a total projected
cost of approximately $32 million over the next 20 years.
Safety and Reliability
The continued safety and reliability of the St. Lawrence Seaway is
the foundation upon which we can promote and accommodate increases in
maritime cargo. The Seaway is already one of the world's safest
waterways and that safety record continues to improve. Over the past 25
years, the average number of international vessel incidents in the
Seaway requiring GLS intervention has decreased significantly. From
1996-2006, the average number of incidents was 19 per year. However,
from 2007-2021, the average number of incidents declined to only 6 per
year. This positive development can be attributed to several factors,
including the U.S.-Canadian Enhanced Seaway Inspection Program, the use
of the Seaway's Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel traffic
management technology beginning in 2002, the use of the Seaway's Hands
Free Mooring system beginning in 2018, the well-trained and skilled GLS
lock operations and maintenance staff, and a major fleet renewal
program implemented by many of the Seaway's commercial carriers.
In addition, since the Seaway's opening in 1959, the GLS has
consistently maintained a near-perfect reliability rate of 99 percent
for commercial users of its locks in the U.S. sector of the waterway.
During the 2022 navigation season (March 22, 2022-January 1, 2023), the
GLS workforce ably operated and maintained the waterway and lock system
at a reliability rate of 99.6 percent and lock availability rate of
99.97 percent. This high mark of success is due primarily to the GLS's
efficient management and operations of the locks and control of vessel
traffic. Global customers from nearly 50 countries return each year to
use the Seaway because of the waterway's strong safety record,
efficient operations, and strong reliability rate.
Upgrades to the Seaway's traffic management system are currently
underway and are expected to provide additional safety, reliability,
and environmental benefits. While the primary goal of the envisioned
Vessel Information System (VIS) project is to improve transits within
the Seaway, new applications for connecting the entire Great Lakes
together will help enable enhanced voyage planning from foreign origin,
transit through the Great Lakes, and to destination. The VIS will have
the ability to gather and process data that could provide
recommendations to safely facilitate maximum operational efficiency.
This includes scheduling vessel inspections, bridge closures, pilotage
services, and dock usage at ports, as well as lockages, while
respecting the interests of individual vessels. This multi-year project
is underway, in conjunction with the Canadian SLSMC, the U.S.
Department of Transportation's Volpe National Transportation Systems
Center (Cambridge, Massachusetts), other Great Lakes Seaway System
users, and stakeholders.
Environmental Stewardship
The GLS also implements strict ballast water management efforts to
prevent any new introductions of aquatic invasive species via
commercial vessels entering Seaway waters. In 2008, the GLS and
Canadian SLSMC jointly started enforcing regulations that all vessels
with no ballast in their tanks must conduct saltwater flushing of the
empty ballast water tanks before arriving in the Seaway. The GLS, along
with the U.S. Coast Guard, Transport Canada, and the SLSMC, formed the
Ballast Water Working Group (BWWG) to enforce ballast water inspections
of all vessels to ensure these regulations are carried out. The BWWG's
annual summary report documents the Group's inspection results and
findings.\4\ The report measures both the performance of the binational
inspection team in inspecting the ballast tanks of incoming ocean
vessels and the compliance by the oceangoing trade in meeting U.S. and
Canadian ballast water management requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

transiting-the-seaway/ballast-water/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
From both a performance and compliance perspective, the results of
the 2022 report are outstanding. In 2022, every ballast tank of every
ocean vessel entering the Seaway was assessed--10,239 ballast tanks on
521 vessel transits. The BWWG found that the compliance rate by
industry in 2022 for low salinity non-compliant tanks was 98.2
percent.\5\ In those rare instances where salinity levels do not meet
the standard, the ballast tanks are retained to ensure no discharge is
made in the Lakes, and tanks are then re-inspected on the vessel's
outbound journey to ensure that the tank was not used on its voyage in
the Great Lakes. Since 2009, 100 percent of international vessels
entering the Seaway have received a ballast water management assessment
by GLS inspectors or other BWWG partners.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Great Lakes Seaway System has one of the most stringent
inspection regimes in the world. The effectiveness of the Seaway's
ballast water inspection program has been publicly credited as a key
factor in dramatically reducing the risk of introduction of invasive
species into the Great Lakes. Since 2006, there have been only 2 new
aquatic invasive species identified in the Great Lakes that the
scientific community considers are possibly associated with ballast
water, but the timing of introduction and actual source pathways are
uncertain. This can be compared to 15 new aquatic invasive species that
were identified from 1993-2006, the equivalent time period before the
new regulations, which the scientific community strongly attributes to
ballast water.
A recently published study has given independent scientific
validation to the binational ballast water regulations. The study
analyzed aquatic invasive species invasion rates and shipping data for
three different regulatory periods, pre-regulation, partial regulation,
and total regulation, and concluded that the Seaway's ballast water
regulations are likely the primary, but possibly not only, reason for
the dramatic reduction in the apparent invasion rate for the Great
Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin. The report states, ``To our knowledge,
the 2006/2008 regulation is the only case of a policy intervention that
is linked to a massive reduction of the invasion rate of a large
aquatic ecosystem,'' and ``this case is an encouraging example of
binational response to a transboundary problem, whose apparent success
was achieved through rigorous application of an evidence-based,
operationally feasible management solution involving participation by
governments, the shipping industry, and academia from both countries.''
\6\ The authors believe that the regulation has likely prevented
several disruptive invasions, and it is their opinion that ballast
water exchange should be maintained as a requirement for vessels
entering the Great Lakes in the future, even if performance standards
requiring ballast water treatment systems are imposed on all inbound
vessels.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While the GLS has previously received validation of the
effectiveness of its ballast water regulations and inspection program
this independent validation is the most comprehensive and definitive
analysis to date that verifies the effectiveness and success of this
important binational environmental program. The GLS is proud of its
efforts in serving as an environmental gatekeeper to the St. Lawrence
Seaway and will continue to perform these important inspections.
Infrastructure Modernization
The locks, channels, and accompanying infrastructure of the St.
Lawrence Seaway owned and maintained by the GLS are ``perpetual''
transportation assets that require periodic and regular capital
reinvestment to continue operating safely, reliably, and efficiently.
After 50 years of continuous operation with only minimal capital
reinvestment, Congress approved the authorization and funding for the
GLS's infrastructure renewal program beginning in FY 2009. The start of
the program marked the first time in the Seaway's history that a
coordinated effort to repair and modernize the U.S. Seaway
infrastructure had taken place.
From FY 2009-2022, the GLS spent $209 million on 62 infrastructure-
related projects. Major infrastructure projects completed over that
period included maintenance dredging in the U.S. portion of the Seaway
navigation channel, lock miter gate and culvert valve machinery
upgrades, culvert valve replacements, hands-free mooring installation
at the locks, gatelifter upgrades, miter gate rehabilitation, tugboat
replacements, and various other structural and equipment repairs and/or
replacements.
During the 2022 navigation season, the GLS recorded the lowest
level of delays on record for lock-related disruptions to navigation (2
hours, 3 minutes), resulting in a lock availability rate of 99.97
percent for the 286-day 2022 season. The successful planning and
execution of the SIP, which began in FY 2009, is a key reason for the
achievement of the high reliability rate.
The GLS Seaway Infrastructure Program (SIP) is developed annually
by Corporation engineering, maintenance, lock operations, and policy
staff following annual winter preventative maintenance work and
inspections. This capital planning process ensures that aging
machinery, equipment, and parts are rehabilitated/replaced; that
buildings for employees and the public, grounds, and utilities are
sufficiently maintained/refurbished; and that commercial trade
continues to move on the Seaway safely and without interruption or
delays.
Trade and Economic Development
The statute that created the GLS provided general authority for the
Corporation to undertake trade and economic development activities, and
this is an important aspect of our mission. In recent years, Congress
has provided additional funding for the GLS to expand this program. The
GLS devotes resources to economic development activities aimed at
increasing commercial trade through the St. Lawrence Seaway and
improving economic conditions in the eight Great Lakes States. The
primary benefit is the stimulation of U.S. and Canadian port city
economies through increased maritime industry activity, including
services and employment to support commerce via the Seaway. In 2015,
the GLS designated a Great Lakes Regional Representative who leads this
value-added service for the wider stakeholder community.
Activities undertaken by the GLS include facilitating new trade for
Great Lakes Seaway System ports, conducting trade research and analysis
to assist Great Lakes Seaway System stakeholders in identifying cargo
trends and new business, participating in joint marketing efforts with
the SLSMC, promoting the Seaway System to prospective customers, and
assessing the economic impact of Great Lakes Seaway shipping.
The GLS's trade and economic development activities were
instrumental in the 2014 launch of the first regularly scheduled
international liner service to a U.S. port on the Great Lakes since the
1970's. Working directly with Great Lakes ports, the GLS helps identify
ways to increase tonnage traffic in traditional cargoes as well as in
diversifying the types of cargo moving through the Seaway.
Additionally, the GLS has been instrumental in the growth of
international cruising activity in the Great Lakes. In January 2020,
Viking Cruise Line announced its Great Lakes itineraries and the
construction of two Seaway-sized cruise vessels. The first vessel made
its maiden voyage in May 2022, while the second vessel entered the
Great Lakes Seaway System in May 2023. This adds to the nine other
cruise vessels that have itineraries in the Lakes. The GLS continues to
work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to find ways to streamline
passenger processing and bring more cruise vessels to Great Lakes
ports. Seaway stakeholders and Great Lakes communities are realizing
the benefits of this growing tourism industry through the economic
impact that the Great Lakes passenger cruising is stimulating. It is a
success story that has resonated through local communities and is
amplified by increasing recognition of the Great Lakes as a destination
of choice in national and international profile.
Current Issues
Water Levels--Water outflows and levels from Lake Ontario to the
lower St. Lawrence River can significantly impact the safe and
efficient operation of commercial navigation in the Seaway. If Lake
Ontario water levels reach certain levels, the downstream water levels
and regulated outflows can become unsafe for commercial navigation
through the Seaway. The 2023 shipping season has not been significantly
affected by water level or outflow issues due to less precipitation or
drier conditions overall this year.
Lake Ontario water outflows are regulated by the International
Joint Commission (IJC), and its International Lake Ontario St. Lawrence
River Board (Board) is the entity that manages the outflow rates.
Outflows are governed by a water regulation plan, Plan 2014, which the
IJC and the Board implemented in January 2017 after many years of
interagency and binational discussions regarding the prioritization of
uses for the boundary waters. The GLS and the Canadian Seaway have
worked closely with the IJC and the Board over the past several years
to ensure that the priority rights of the Seaway and commercial
navigation established by the U.S. and Canadian Governments in the
Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909, reaffirmed by both countries in their
concurrence of Plan 2014, and reiterated in the accompanying joint U.S.
and Canadian Government documents, including the Supplementary Order of
Approval, continue to be respected.

Pilotage--All international vessels entering the Great Lakes St.
Lawrence Seaway System are required by U.S. and Canadian regulations to
have a certified vessel pilot on board to assist the vessel's captain
in navigating the vessel. The oversight of pilotage services is a
state-regulated activity everywhere in the United States, except for
the Great Lakes, where pilotage is regulated by the U.S. Coast Guard
Office of Great Lakes Pilotage pursuant to the Great Lakes Pilotage Act
of 1960.
In addition to overseeing the three U.S. pilot districts in the
Great Lakes Seaway System, the U.S. Coast Guard also establishes the
rates that the U.S. pilots may charge for the provision of their
services to vessel owners. Changes in the rate adjustment methodology
have been controversial and have been met with criticism and litigation
from various U.S. and Canadian commercial navigation stakeholders. The
availability and increasing cost of U.S. pilotage services in the Great
Lakes Seaway System are crucial components of the Seaway's safety and
economic competitiveness. It is essential that the availability of
Great Lakes Seaway System pilots be maintained in a manner that ensures
safety while promoting the competitiveness of the waterway.

Safety--The GLS remains dedicated to safely and efficiently
operating the U.S. portion of the St. Lawrence Seaway while also
promoting the economic benefits of the marine mode, attracting new
cargoes to the Great Lakes Seaway System, and leveraging technology and
innovation to enhance the system's performance and safety. Since the
opening of the Seaway in 1959, the GLS has been a model of binational
partnership, ensuring that this international waterway is one of the
safest and most reliable transportation routes in the world. With the
investments being made in the St. Lawrence Seaway by the United States
and Canada, it will remain so for many years to come.

Green Shipping Corridor Network--In November 2022, the U.S. and
Canada jointly announced the intention to facilitate development of a
Green Shipping Corridor Network (GSCN) on the Great Lakes St. Lawrence
Seaway System. Since that time, U.S. and Canadian federal agencies have
coordinated with state, provincial, local, private-sector, non-
governmental, and indigenous peoples' organizations to begin that
process.
On April 4, 2023, the GLS and SLSMC co-sponsored the first-ever
Collaborative Forum (Forum) regarding establishing a GSCN on the
System. The Forum was designed to create a common body of knowledge to
identify opportunities for voluntary collaboration efforts and
implementation strategies, based on best available science and
technology, explore physical and operational issues affecting
development of the GSCN, and establish GSCN Working Groups. It was a
highly collaborative event, which included keynote speeches,
interactive panels, and robust collaboration among the nearly 100
attendees. Feedback from attendees suggests that the Forum was well
received as an informative and constructive first step in establishing
the GSCN. The Seaway Corporations will continue to support the U.S. and
Canadian governments towards establishment of a voluntary GSCN,
including coordination with implementation working groups and planning
future forums.

Thank you again for the opportunity to submit this statement for
the record.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentlemen for their testimony
today, and now we will move in to questions. I recognize myself
for up to 5 minutes.
First, I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a
letter sent by Chairman Sam Graves and myself, as well as
Republican leaders from the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee, Senator Shelley Moore Capito and Cynthia Lummis, to
Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Mr. Connor,
and EPA Administrator Michael Regan, dated June 21, 2023.
Without objection, so ordered.
[The information follows:]

Letter of June 21, 2023, to Hon. Michael S. Regan, Administrator, U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, and Hon. Michael L. Connor, Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, U.S. Department of the Army,
from U.S. Senators Capito and Lummis, and U.S. Representatives Graves
of Missouri and Rouzer, Submitted for the Record by Hon. David Rouzer
Congress of the United States,
Washington, DC 20515,
June 21, 2023.
The Honorable Michael S. Regan,
Administrator,
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW,
Washington, DC 20004.
The Honorable Michael L. Connor,
Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works,
U.S. Department of the Army, 108 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310.
Dear Administrator Regan and Assistant Secretary Connor:
We write to request a detailed update on the planned next steps of
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of
Engineers (Corps), collectively ``Agencies,'' in response to the
Supreme Court's (Court) recently issued decision in Sackett v. EPA, 598
U.S. __ (May 25, 2023) (Sackett II). The Court's ruling reinforces
property owners' rights, protects the separation of powers by limiting
your Agencies' authority to what Congress has delegated in statute, and
ensures adherence to the congressional intent in writing the Clean
Water Act (CWA). Additionally, the Court upholds the cooperative
federalism framework of the CWA, as well as the states' authority and
responsibility to regulate non-Federal waters within their borders. All
nine Supreme Court justices agreed that the Biden Administration's
definition of ``waters of the United States'' (WOTUS) based on
``significant nexus'' is illegitimate, and a majority of the Court
articulated a clear, easily administrable definition of WOTUS.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Sackett v. EPA, No. 21-454 (U.S. May 25, 2023), available at
https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21454_4g15.pdf; 598 U.S. __
(2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In implementing the Court's decision, the Agencies must adhere to
the majority opinion and not slow-walk compliance with the decision.
The Agencies wasted valuable time and resources by prioritizing the
promulgation of a rule over the first two years of the Biden
Administration; that is now clearly unlawful. Notably, this
Administration ignored our repeated admonitions that the Agencies
should wait until the Supreme Court acted to proceed,\2\ and our
warnings that the rule being drafted would not be ``durable.'' \3\ Now
the EPA and the Corps must work to bring application of WOTUS quickly
and effectively in line with Sackett II.

Halt New WOTUS Definition Rulemaking, Await SCOTUS Decision'' (Feb. 23,

republicans-tell-biden-administration-to-halt-new-wotus-definition-
rulemaking-await-scotus-decision.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While we are pleased to see Sackett II clearly define the scope of
the Agencies' regulatory authority, we are concerned that the
Administration is now delaying implementation of the ruling. For
instance, in response to the Supreme Court's decision, some Corps
districts have stated that they will temporarily halt the review and
issuance of approved jurisdictional determinations.\4\ Such a freeze in
processing jurisdictional determinations unnecessarily delays the
permitting process for projects. The Agencies previously used taxpayer
resources to revisit already settled jurisdictional determinations
issued by the previous Administration. The Biden Administration must
now follow the law by implementing the Supreme Court's decision with
the same fervor it showed in its prior efforts on WOTUS. Failure to do
so is indicative that these recent delays are needless at best, or
intentional efforts to halt economic development at worst.

Following the Court's ruling in Rapanos v. EPA, the Agencies took a
year to provide interim legal guidance and two years to issue the 2008
guidance document on implementing that case.\5\ However, implementing
the ruling in Rapanos was legally complex because of the 4-1-4 nature
of the decision. By contrast, the ``continuous surface connection
test'' upheld by a majority of the Court in Sackett II is clear and can
be implemented immediately.\6\

In order to comply with the Court's ruling, the Agencies must
provide immediate direction to their regional and district offices to
apply Sackett II in the evaluation of jurisdictional determinations and
permits, ensuring clarity and consistent nationwide application of CWA
jurisdiction to landowners and the regulated community. Ongoing delays
and confusion will hamper project development across the country,
including those authorized by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act.
In light of these developments, we request a briefing and response
to the following questions no later than June 28, 2023, so that we may
fully understand the Administration's plan to implement a truly durable
definition of a WOTUS in line with Sackett II:
1.  What concrete steps are the Agencies taking following Sackett
II to implement the majority's opinion?
2.  Will you direct the Corps to immediately resume the issuance of
jurisdictional determinations? If not, please provide a detailed
explanation justifying the failure to resume issuance.

David Rouzer,
Member of Congress, Chairman,
T&I Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment.

Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Connor, can you elaborate more on what the
administration plans to do moving forward?
And the first question I have before you get to that one
is, do you agree the ruling, the Sackett ruling--I understand
that the administration doesn't like the ruling, as you
mentioned, in your testimony. But do you agree the ruling
provides clarity?
Mr. Connor. Yes, the ruling provides clarity for the most
part. There are some nuances there that I think people would
debate. But as far as our view of the rule and its
implementation, we will implement a new rule with those clear
parameters in the Sackett decision in place. So, there will
always be some debate, Mr. Chairman, I guess that is what I am
getting at. But, for the most part, it is a very clear----
Mr. Rouzer [interrupting]. Now, are you moving to a final
rule, or is this going to follow the normal rulemaking process?
And what kind of timeline are we looking at?
Mr. Connor. I expect that we will be moving forward with a
final rule, as allowed by the Administrative Procedure Act.
Mr. Rouzer. OK.
Mr. Connor. And that work is--to elaborate on your prior
question, that work is already underway. We are already
surgically looking at the rule that was promulgated in January,
looking at the adjustments. And I do believe that there is
great value to that rule because it does have separable
elements such as significant nexus, which, obviously, does no
longer apply, which can be X'ed out of the rule.
Other aspects of the rule were unaffected: exemptions,
primary waters, whether they are navigable, Territorial seas,
those primary jurisdictional waters.
The relatively permanent test that the court maintained,
that is part of the rule. That will stay as a whole piece.
Continuous surface connection. There is an aspect of that
that is in the rule that will, obviously, be preserved.
Other parts of the rules that are affected will no longer
be part of what we expect to be a final rule that will be
issued expeditiously.
Mr. Rouzer. So, comment period, will there be any comment
period? A lot of stakeholders on both sides would like to have
input, I am sure.
Mr. Connor. Even in moving to direct final rulemaking,
there are allowances for a comment period. Those decisions have
not yet been finalized. I expect, you know, I get that
``expeditiously'' is not as specific as you would probably like
at this point in time, but it does mean as soon as possible. We
have a duty to deal with ongoing litigation. I expect in the
next week we will firm up the more specific answers to your
question, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Rouzer. So, will guidance be released to the district
Corps offices from headquarters to allow approved
jurisdictional determinations to be completed? What is the
timeline for that?
Mr. Connor. Well, I think we are going to focus on this
next step, final rulemaking. I think that will provide--because
of the work that we have done previously, that will provide
significant guidance to the Corps. But with respect to issuing
AJDs, which we have taken a pause on, I don't expect that we
will be back in the AJD business until we get this final rule
in place. The Corps ties its jurisdictional determinations to
the rules that are in place right now. We have the January 2023
rule, I think, in 23 jurisdictions. We have pre-2015 guidance
regulations in 27 jurisdictions. We need to clean that all up,
have a clear final rule that the Corps can tie its
jurisdictional determinations.
So, same, I guess, answer to the question is expeditiously.
We will get back into the AJD determinations as soon as we
finalize this rule.
Mr. Rouzer. So, in your estimation, how different is this
new rule going to look versus the current rule?
Do you think it is a significant deviation from the current
rule, or a similar--trying to incorporate the merit or the
fundamentals of the court's ruling?
Mr. Connor. It will be different because the ``significant
nexus'' test is no longer applicable. So, that will be out of
the final rule that we are making.
So, we are trying to be pretty straightforward with this,
Mr. Chairman. There will be specific aspects of that rule that
are no longer valid, given the court's determination in
Sackett. We will delete those portions of the rule. But as I
mentioned, I think there are many aspects of the rule that will
still stand that are very consistent with the Sackett decision,
such as relatively permanent or unaffected, such as the
exemptions, express exemptions that we provided in the rule.
Mr. Rouzer. My time has expired. I now recognize my friend
and colleague from California, Mrs. Napolitano.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Secretary Connor, WRDA 2020 established clear direction to
the Corps to allocate 12 percent of the Harbor Maintenance
Trust Fund for expanded use at donor ports such as the Port of
Los Angeles and Long Beach, and other energy transfer ports.
However, the court did not make this funding allocation to
donor ports in 2023. My region's ports and donor ports
throughout the Nation worked with Congress to ensure they
receive their fair share of HMT funds.
Section 102 of WRDA 2020 culminated this HMT fund agreement
by specifically directing the Corps to meet the statutory
targets in the law passed by Congress and signed by the
President.
Furthermore, it's surprising that donor ports are not
receiving the WRDA 2020 allocations when your testimony states
that the Corps gives priority to maintenance of coastal ports
with the highest commercial traffic.
Does the Corps recognize that the WRDA 2020 provides clear
direction on Congress' intent to ensure donor ports receive
their fair share of HMT funds?
And is the Corps aware of the donor ports' requests for
expanded use eligibilities outlined in WRDA 2020, including
specific requests from Los Angeles and Long Beach?
How will the Corps be responsive to these requests, in
light of the clear allocation language for donor ports in WRDA
2020 and your testimony that high-volume commercial harbors are
prioritized?
Mr. Connor. Ranking Member Napolitano, this has been a
subject of great discussion since we released our budget, and
there is a lot of interest in that expanded uses for donor
ports provision that was included in WRDA 2020. So, to the
extent I didn't understand the congressional intent, I
guarantee I understand it a lot more right now.
We don't have a provision for that. The law specifically
says ``to the extent possible.'' Our priority is always going
to be to use the resources we have to maintain channel
capacity, depth, and width. And that is the responsibility. But
we do understand the WRDA 2020 provision was Congress' intent
that there is a balance there that we have to maintain with
those donor ports and their need for resources for expanded
uses.
So, not including the 2024 budget, what we are doing now is
asking the Corps to survey those donor ports, understand the
demand, the need for those expanded use resources so that we
will have that information as we--what I would expect through
the appropriations process, there will be a 2024 workplan, we
will have that information available to try and accommodate,
consistent with the language ``to the extent possible,'' those
expanded uses for donor ports.
So, we need the information. We need to then balance that
with our fundamental obligation for depth and width,
maintaining the channels through our process.
Mrs. Napolitano. Well, that is 3 years. We hope to get it
done before too long, sir.
The next question is, we directed the Corps to undertake a
study implementing water supply as the Corps' mission. I am
very concerned the study has not been completed yet. And the
status of the study is? And when do we expect the completion?
Mr. Connor. So, with respect to the study itself, as we
discussed previously, Ranking Member Napolitano, these reports
take a while, and they take a while because they require
resources. We sometimes try and answer too many questions
rather than the direct one that Congress asked us to address.
Basically, I apologize for the length of time that it takes.
With respect to this particular report, it has gone back
and forth between my office and the Corps. I expect I will have
it again here in the next month, and we will expeditiously turn
this around to get this completed for you in the July/August
timeframe. That is my goal and my commitment to you.
Can I just say very quickly, though, notwithstanding the
status of the report, we are all on board and we are taking
actions very consistent with what your goal is in the Corps
having a role with respect to water supply issues, particularly
in the West. Through our programs and through our projects, and
to the projects that we are in the design phase on, we have the
means and the ability to work with our partners----
Mrs. Napolitano [interrupting]. And you have the money.
Mr. Connor [continuing]. To help facilitate water supply.
Mrs. Napolitano. And you have the money.
Mr. Connor. Yes.
Mrs. Napolitano. The Corps is increasingly doing important
work updating water control manuals in the West. Specifically,
water conservation measures. What is the current status of
water control manual updates?
Mr. Connor [to Major General Graham]. You want to take the
water control?
General Graham. Ranking Member Napolitano, thank you for
that question on our water control manuals. And flat out, we
are behind on updating them.
The water control manuals should take no longer than 10
years to update them. And we have many that are beyond that.
Mrs. Napolitano. Fifty years.
General Graham. Yes, ma'am.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you.
General Graham. So, we are prioritizing that on our work.
We do have some challenge, and I will give you one for-instance
that is probably near and dear to your heart.
When I looked at the Sacramento District and I asked them
about Lake Oroville, which--that water control manual, which
has FIRO as part of it, is probably going to take about up to 7
years. So, I asked where their engineers are working right now.
We pulled them to work on the drought. Or, I am sorry, on the
snowpack coming off the Sierra Nevadas. So, that is our
challenge right now, and we are committed to providing the
labor necessary.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for your indulgence.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Mast.
Mr. Mast. Thank you, Chairman.
General, essayons; Secretary, thank you both for being
here. If your staffs briefed you that I want to talk about
algal blooms, as I am sure all my colleagues know I want to
talk about, then you are right. They were right to brief you
about that.
So, last year, WRDA 2022, we moved a provision that
directed the Army Corps to put a note in the file of personnel
working around structures on Lake Okeechobee that have high
exposures to toxic algal blooms. So, I want to get a little
idea of where that is at, what that is looking like today.
[Slide shown.]
Mr. Mast. You have got an image up here. This is what the
lake looks like today. Where you see all that red, that is
where the wind pushes all those toxic algal blooms up into my
area. So, it is taking place as we speak, has been taking place
throughout the summer already.
So, the first question is just: Has implementation of
denoting that in a file in some form or fashion begun?
General Graham. Congressman Mast, thank you for that
question. And I don't know if you planned it this way or it
just worked out this way, but I did get a call last night from
General Hibner that at Port Mayaca structure 308, we did have
testing that exceeded eight parts per billion for----
Mr. Mast [interrupting]. Eighty, I was told. So, 10 times.
Eighty was the number I was told.
General Graham. So, my report was higher than that. And the
first report, as you well know, is always wrong, but it
certainly exceeded eight parts per billion.
So, the Jacksonville District has put in place, as per WRDA
2022, section 8141, that we will, for any worker that was at
Port Mayaca, we--and I think there is only one there--we will
document that in their records.
In addition, as when you and I met there 3 years ago now,
measures to protect the employees, and that can include
limiting outside exposure, and masks when possible. We are also
reporting that to the South Florida Water Management District.
And we will work with Mr. Bartlett and his team to see if we
need to come out and do mitigation efforts.
Mr. Mast. It could be fluid, which staff are out there,
civilian, uniformed. Is the intent of the Corps of Engineers to
do that for both civilian and uniformed personnel, if they
are----
General Graham [interrupting]. Absolutely, and we are
working through the procedures for medical privacy to make sure
we do that correctly.
Mr. Mast. And give us an idea of--would that look like a
dosimeter would look like for somebody that had radiological
exposure, where it is added up over time, or would it be a
letter for each day that somebody is exposed, and it says, hey,
you worked 8 hours today or 10 hours today, give us an idea of
what it actually will look like in practice.
General Graham. Right now, I believe it is going to look
like a letter that goes in their file that documents that. But
we are developing this as we go, and I am sure we will have
some things to learn.
Mr. Mast. What would be a full day for somebody out there,
typically?
General Graham. I believe those are 8-hour shifts.
Mr. Mast. OK, all right. I thank you for the answers on
that. It is good information to me to understand how you are
actually implementing this.
So, I want to move a little bit to earlier in the season,
sticking with algal blooms. There were discharges going on out
of Lake Okeechobee to the coastline. It was going on back in
February. It was going on, I think, even, in part, in January.
But those discharges were stopped because of untraditionally
early seasonal algal blooms. I can't remember seeing them in
January, February, March before. And so, I thank the Corps and
the South Florida Water Management District for working
together to stop those discharges when algal blooms became
present.
The question that I want to ask you might seem obvious, but
it is obvious because I am looking to have an answer on the
record of why this took place. Why did the Corps and the water
management district stop those discharges, whether they were at
8 parts per billion, or 80, or whatever the level was at that
time, why was that decision made to stop those discharges at
that time?
What did you consider the impacts to be that you said, hey,
it is important enough that we stop these, or stop these until
we test them, or whatever reason? Walk me through that
decisionmaking so the community can understand the hazards.
General Graham. So, Congressman Mast, I don't know the
specifics on that instance. I was aware that we were
discharging east. And my understanding sitting here today is
that the pause, or the stopping those discharges east was
mainly a water management decision. But I am not 100 percent
certain that it wasn't that in S308 there were those algal
blooms and they didn't want to release them. So----
Mr. Mast [interrupting]. So, I am going to pause you,
because I have got about 10 seconds left.
I appreciate that you don't--I don't think it was for water
management reasons. I think it was because of the presence of
those blooms.
We are going to write you some questions for the record. If
you could get back to us with answers on that decisionmaking
process at a later time.
General Graham. Absolutely.
Mr. Mast. We would appreciate those answers.
Thank you, Chairman. I can't yield you back any time, but
thank you for recognizing me.
Mr. Rouzer. Absolutely.
Mr. Larsen.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, and the first question
I have is for Mr. Tindall-Schlicht.
About 10 years ago, I think it was Representative Oberstar
asked the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development
Corporation to do a--I think it was a capital improvement
program, update your capital assets. It has been about 10 years
for that 10-year plan. How would you assess yourself right now
in terms of the update of your capital assets?
Mr. Tindall-Schlicht. The work remains ongoing, and it has
been a success.
Again, $209 million on 62 different capital asset projects
have been invested in an array of seaway infrastructure
projects. We credit that as both a--10 years ago, when the
capital asset renewal program was founded, that was reactive.
The assets then were 50 years old and required an intervention
to make sure that they could continue operating. In its current
form, including in the 2024 budget, the seaway infrastructure
program is proactive, looking at the state of those assets--
locks, vessels, our facilities that help us support the ongoing
operation of the seaway--making sure that they will continue to
operate for decades ahead.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. All right, thank you.
Mr. Connor, certainly a 23-percent cut in the Corps' budget
would have been fairly disastrous in my district and probably
in many other districts. Now we are looking at something along
the lines, at least in the House of Representatives, based on a
fiscal year 2022 instead of the deal that was negotiated, and
people ought to be sticking with, which was 1 percent.
Has the Corps been asked to look at what the appropriations
might mean if we adopted a fiscal year 2022 number for either
your operations and maintenance or for your capital?
Mr. Connor. Ranking Member Larsen, we have not looked
specifically at that provision. We are fortunate with respect
to the $17.1 billion that was provided, that we have got
resources to attack a significant part of the backlog, and we
have been doing that.
I think the reality is, obviously, I support the
President's budget. The $7.4 billion that we have will be used
wisely to continue the highest priority projects and the ones
that we need to maintain to minimize risk and maximize
efficiency. So, we are focused on the investments we can make
with that budget.
Obviously, the additional resources that Congress has been
providing in the annual appropriations process is absolutely
critical. Just getting to the discussion we just had about
expanded uses, there are a lot of things left on the cutting
room table that I know are priorities for Congress.
And I was--the mark that was just issued by House Energy
and Water does provide significant additional resources on top
of the budget. We will continue to work with Members of
Congress in effectively deploying any resources that we might
finally get. But, to your point, we have a huge backlog, and we
have a huge number of needs, and they are growing, given the
most recent WRDA that we have seen with additional
authorizations, additional needs by communities across the
country.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Well, for those of us who voted
for IIJA, publicly we say you are welcome. For those who voted
against it, I am sure privately they will say thank you to you,
as well.
General, with regards to outreach, especially to Tribes,
you have put this in the context of Justice40, which I think is
really important, especially where I come from. I can think of
five of the--well, probably six of the federally recognized
Tribes of the eight that I have a privilege to share a
jurisdiction with all probably have very close relationships
with the Corps.
Are there specific additional outreach steps the Corps is
taking through the Tribal Partnership Program that you can
enlighten us about?
General Graham. Ranking Member Larsen, thank you, and
absolutely.
With Mr. Connor's guidance, we are working to listen better
to the Tribes. The additional funding that we received, the
supplemental funding, the BIL funding, is certainly helping
with that. We have some rapid tools to be able to do that:
better Planning Assistance to States, Floodplain Management
Services, and the Continuing Authorities program. But most
importantly, the changes and advancements to the Tribal
Partnership Program.
Mr. Connor. Can I just quickly add? New guidance will be
issued for the Tribal Partnership Program. Congress has given
us additional tools.
We are trying to move from a Tribal program where we don't
harm Tribal interests to we effectively move forward Tribal
interests. TPP is part of that. We have a new consultation
policy out on the street to ensure that we are responsive to
Tribes, that we are not just listening, but we are actually
responding to what we hear. This is a huge priority for the
administration. It is a huge priority for the Civil Works
program.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. That is great, I appreciate that.
And I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Edwards.
Mr. Edwards. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Lyash, I have been only on this Hill for 6 months now,
so, every day is a new first for me. I am particularly pleased
that you have offered me a new first in appearing before a
committee with the testimony that your organization receives no
Federal appropriation, and that your debt is not reported by
the U.S. Treasury. So, thank you. Thank you for offering that.
I also thank you and applaud the tour that your staff gave
me and my staff recently, the hydro dam in my district. It is a
very impressive operation, and I appreciate the clean energy
and significant amount of energy that you provide to western
North Carolina.
TVA, as you know, is responsible for advancing the economic
and social well-being of the people living in the Tennessee
River Basin. And that is a responsibility that seems to me to
go well beyond its traditional role of generating power and
distributing that power. And given the importance of broadband
connectivity in today's economy, particularly in western North
Carolina, where the topography is so complicated, I would argue
that fulfilling TVA's statutory objective includes ensuring
that residents of TVA areas are given access to quality
internet service.
And due to the mountainous terrain of my district, many of
my constituents in western North Carolina continue to go
without internet access. However, utility poles can play a key
role in expanding connectivity to rural communities. And I have
had the pleasure of working with you and TVA on plans for new
utility poles in my district, and it is my understanding that
TVA has the authority to regulate a local power company's pole
access process with broadband providers seeking to service the
Tennessee River Basin. Proactive efforts to collaborate with
broadband companies would be monumental for the citizens in my
district, and I am confident that my fellow representatives of
the Tennessee River Basin would agree.
What obstacles exist today to your cooperation with local
power companies to bring broadband access to underserved areas
in the TVA river basin?
Mr. Lyash. Thank you for the question, Congressman, and
thank you for the kind remarks. I appreciate them, and I know
the team does.
TVA is not directly responsible for deploying broadband,
but I agree with you. Our mission of service and the nexus of
broadband with providing energy, being able to apply the
technology that makes energy transmission efficient and
economic development, both parts of our mission, have an
intersection with universal deployment of broadband access. And
so, in that regard we see it as very important.
A few things that we are focused on. TVA is deploying
hundreds of miles of fiber across the Tennessee Valley region
and supporting use of that fiber by local power companies and
providers on a lease basis to give them access to the broader
internet system, and many are taking us up on that. We
established a process to enable pole attachments by for-profit
providers, and we are working with local power companies to
make sure that they provide them timely and effective access
where those providers are looking to do that.
Mr. Edwards. And so--excuse me, because I am running out of
time--there are a couple questions I would really like to get
to, and I appreciate the efforts that have been made, but you
hold one of the greatest assets in western North Carolina, and
that is those power poles. Are there any specific obstacles
that are preventing TVA from granting access to those power
poles for for-profit companies that would like to extend
broadband to western North Carolina?
Mr. Lyash. From TVA's perspective and our assets, the
answer is no. Remember, we serve retail customers through 153
local power companies. So, predominantly, the providers need
access to local power company distribution poles. And in that
regard, we are working with each local power company to ensure
they provide that access. And if internet providers are not
willing to serve the area, local power companies can stand up a
business to do so.
And we have made quite a lot of progress in this regard
over the last number of years. We do still have pockets that
need support, and I agree that your area is one of them.
Mr. Edwards. So, can I get your commitment that we will
continue to work on that together, to bring broadband access to
rural North Carolina?
Mr. Lyash. Yes, you have my commitment and not just to
support it, but to act as a convener to draw local power
companies, the providers, together with TVA to develop some
site-specific, area-specific plans to do just that.
Mr. Edwards. All right, thank you. I look forward to that.
Mr. Lyash. You are quite welcome.
Mr. Edwards. Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Stanton, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
The 2020 Water Resources Development Act included my
legislation to authorize the Arizona Environmental
Infrastructure Authority to assist Arizona communities and
Tribes with their water infrastructure needs. In the nearly 3
years since, we have delivered more than $37 million, thanks in
part to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 23 projects
across the State, including a water reclamation facility in my
district.
I was pleased to see for the first time that the
administration included environmental infrastructure funding in
its budget request. Although the amount requested is small
compared to the amount Congress has provided for EI over the
last several years, its inclusion into the budget is long
overdue, and it is a long overdue recognition of the importance
of these projects within the Corps overall mission.
In a July 2022 memo, the Corps notes that EI funding is a
key component of its efforts to support drought-impacted
communities in the West. As we continue to deal with the
significant impacts of the 1,200-year drought in the Colorado
River Basin, the Corps should not let up on its support for EI
funding to help Arizona communities utilize wastewater more
efficiently, recharge area aquifers, and improve water delivery
through new wells and pipelines.
Since the Arizona EI Authority first launched, my office
has worked closely with the Los Angeles District to select
projects to be funded. For fiscal year 2024, we identified five
projects totaling several million dollars, yet the Corps
division has indicated a capability of only $100,000. This is a
vastly different capability than we expected, and I am
frustrated that the Corps has seemingly ignored the district's
recommendations, despite a clear need. And further, the Corps
failed to communicate with my office about it.
We now face a scenario, based on the current draft of the
House Energy and Water Appropriations bill, that there will be
no additional resources for Arizona communities to advance
their environmental infrastructure projects. This probably
would not have been the case, had the Corps communicated that
it would only identify capability for individual priority
projects.
I have questions for Assistant Secretary Connor and General
Graham.
Why is there a disconnect between the Los Angeles District,
between what the Los Angeles District has expressed as
capability, and what division and headquarters believe is that
capability?
And why is there a difference in capability for a
standalone project under the EI authority versus including the
same project and several others in a general funding request
under the authority?
General Graham. Representative Stanton, first, thank you
for that question, and I own that failure. I talked to the
commander in L.A., and we own the miscommunication, and we
apologize for that.
Our capability is certainly above $100,000. The
miscommunication was they thought that was for programmatic
administrative oversight. So, that is my failure. I think the
capability is truly more around $14 million when you aggregate
all those projects together, and we will continue to work with
your office to make sure that we can meet your needs
programmatically.
The district has raised its game. It has added additional
staff, which is a great thing. It has upgraded its website, but
we realize we need to do better at this, and our commitment to
you is to do just that.
Mr. Stanton. Please.
Mr. Connor. Congressman, if I could just add very quickly,
Arizona is ground zero for the extended drought and long-term
reductions in water supply that we project for the American
West.
It is impressive, the work that the communities are doing
in using all the tools of Government. We view ourselves as part
of that whole-of-Government response to this situation, so, our
EI program is a huge part of that. We will fix the
miscommunications, because this is an important way the Corps
can be part of the solutions to help Arizona transition to that
reduced water future.
Mr. Stanton. I appreciate the apology and the
acknowledgment that $14 million is probably the more
appropriate number. What steps is the Corps taking to correct
this with the Appropriations Committee?
Mr. Connor. With respect to the appropriations that we have
available, we are going to have to think that through, quite
frankly. So, let us see what resources we have, and then we
will get back to you on the record for that.
Mr. Stanton. Changing gears, I want to touch on the Tres
Rios ecosystem restoration project. We have talked about it
many times.
Assistant Secretary Connor, is the Corps on track to
complete the Post-Authorization Change Report and cost update
in time for the 2024 WRDA bill?
Mr. Connor. We are going to have to get back to you on the
record for that one, Congressman Stanton.
Mr. Stanton. I look forward to hearing back from you soon
on both of those critically important issues to the State of
Arizona.
I yield back.
Mr. Connor. Absolutely.
Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Babin, you are
recognized for 5 minutes.
Dr. Babin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it, and I
want to say thank you to all of you witnesses for being here
today.
I am from Texas and represent the 36th Congressional
District, which is home to some critical ports and waterways.
So, I would like to thank you all for your commitment to
protecting and improving our Nation's waterways and natural
resources.
Mr. Connor, my questions today are for you. There has been
a lot of discussion in this Congress on permitting reform to
ensure project completion. In fact, in the IIJA, Congress
provided significant resources to assist with permitting
approval. I just wanted to ask you, what is the average time
for the Corps to make a decision on a ``dredge and fill''
permit application?
Mr. Connor. I am going to defer to General Graham on that
particular----
Dr. Babin [interposing]. OK, General.
General Graham. For a general permit----
Dr. Babin [interrupting]. A ``dredge and fill'' permit.
General Graham. Our standard is to do those within 60 days.
Dr. Babin. Sixty days.
General Graham. And our track record at meeting that is
roughly 75 percent of the time right now.
Dr. Babin. OK. And how can this process be expedited while
ensuring that we remain good stewards of our environment? What
are some of the things we can do?
General Graham. So, one of the things that we are doing to
get more responsive to the regulated public is leveraging
technology. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided us $160
million to get better. And one of the things we are investing
those funds in is moving into the current century with getting
away from a paper process and moving into an online process--e-
permitting, what we called it. And the great news is we should
have that up and running at the end of this fiscal year or end
of this calendar year.
Dr. Babin. Well, one of the biggest delays we hear
complaints about all the time is permitting. So, I hope that we
can, whatever it takes, expedite that.
Also, another question. The President's fiscal year 2024
budget request includes--and you mentioned this, I think, Mr.
Connor, one of you all did--this was the largest request in
Army Corps history for research and development, for R&D. What
kind of research and development projects does the Corps intend
to use these funds on?
And General or Secretary, whichever one can----
Mr. Connor [interrupting]. So, the R&D funds are
distributed amongst six different categories.
Dr. Babin. OK.
Mr. Connor. We do tactical R&D, which we have always done.
That is the part of the budget that hasn't changed. This is
where we support the R&D needed to carry out specific projects.
So, that we will maintain, that is an important part of what we
do. Coastal Texas was an example of that. We do research
associated to put together that plan.
Other areas, we have ecosystem-related R&D, algal bloom
discussion that we just had with Congressman Mast.
Water modeling is a huge part of that R&D initiative. This
is forecast-informed reservoir operations, advanced water
modeling so that we can operate our facilities differently.
We are doing a lot of infrastructure R&D to help inspect
and, hopefully, we drive down our maintenance costs. So, we are
looking at long-term reductions in civil works.
Other areas, sediment management, how can we more actively
promote beneficial use of dredged material.
And then even crisis mitigation. An example of that is
post-wildfire response. What is our modeling capability to
project where we might have debris flows and extreme flooding
from post-wildfire events, and how do we address that then
through our emergency programs.
Dr. Babin. OK, thank you.
Mr. Connor. Thank you.
Dr. Babin. And thirdly, and finally, the fiscal year 2024
President's budget request is almost $900 million below fiscal
year 2023 enacted budget. So, how would your office decide what
projects are going to receive these reductions for which the
Army Civil Works program is utilizing?
What are some of those criteria, and what are some of those
programs?
Mr. Connor. So, we are focused on--one aspect that is a
priority that we have shared for a long time, which is
completing projects. We want to use resources to complete
projects. We want to address the most significant risk areas.
So, that is a large focus of the O&M activity that we have.
Beyond that, there are priorities. How do we promote the
objectives of our primary mission, aquatic ecosystem
restoration, maintaining our ports and waterways, and certainly
our flood reduction, coastal and inland flooding projects?
So, we prioritize based on where we are in construction
schedules, how we distribute that to promote the resilience
activity that we need, and lastly, we are also trying to
promote more economic equity with respect to the investments we
make. So, it is a mix of risk, finishing projects, and then
advancing items that are soon to be completed, and then
addressing other priorities such as environmental justice, et
cetera.
Dr. Babin. OK. I am out of time. Thank you very much, I
appreciate it.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Rouzer. Ms. Norton.
Ms. Norton. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have one
question. It is for Major General William Graham.
The District of Columbia is wholly dependent on the Potomac
River for its drinking water. But natural or man-made events
could render the river unusable for drinking water. This poses
a risk both to the operations of the Federal Government and to
DC residents.
Currently, the Potomac River is being monitored for drought
conditions as rainfall is significantly below normal levels.
The federally owned and operated Washington aqueduct produces
drinking water from the Potomac River for the District of
Columbia and parts of Virginia. However, the aqueduct maintains
only a single day of backup water supply.
The Water Resources Development Act of 2022 contained my
provision authorizing the Army Corps to conduct a feasibility
study on a secondary drinking water source and additional
drinking water storage capability for DC. I am deeply
disappointed the Army Corps did not fund the study in its
fiscal year 2024 budget.
Major General Graham, why was this critical project not
included in the Army Corps' fiscal year 2024 budget?
And does the Army Corps plan to fund it in the fiscal year
2025 budget?
General Graham. Representative Holmes Norton, thank you for
that question.
And yes, the Washington aqueduct that provides drinking
water to Metropolitan DC uses the Potomac River as its sole
source of water. And we did mitigate that, as we can draw out
of the Potomac River at two different places--traditionally,
from Great Falls and then also down at Little Falls. So, if the
river has an oilspill in it, we can shut one intake off while
the other one is working. But most big cities, as you
mentioned, do have a tertiary source of water supply. We don't.
So, we absolutely acknowledge the need to do that.
Ms. Norton. So, is it in your 2025 budget?
Mr. Connor. With respect to the budget, we have not put
together the 2025 budget, and we will certainly take under
consideration the need here as we develop that budget.
With respect to the 2024 budget, the reality is that by the
end of the calendar year, the budget is pretty much completed.
We have gone through most of the process, and with the
authorization not coming until WRDA 2022, it just was not
considered as part of the 2024 budget.
Ms. Norton. Yes, well, I am clear about that, that it
wasn't in the 2024 budget, but I do want to go on the record to
say this water covers the Congress. It doesn't just cover the
District of Columbia, it covers the surrounding area. So, I am
urgently asking you to fund it in next year's fiscal year
budget.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentlelady yields back. Mr. Burlison.
Mr. Burlison. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for
holding this hearing.
I am from southwest Missouri. And in southwest Missouri,
Table Rock and Bull Shoals are a critical part of our
community. And so, you can imagine I am excited to be on this
committee, because it really reflects what our community wants
and desires and what is important to my district.
And so, I have heard from a lot of constituents on Table
Rock Lake about some concerns. Some of them have to do with
declining parks that are not being maintained. And so, there is
not--the money that is being collected from Table Rock from
fees and other things, they are seemingly going to a general
fund, not being poured back into the community that is spending
the money. Is that correct?
Mr. Connor. That is correct. Those fees are not brought
back, as they are in other Federal recreation facilities.
Mr. Burlison. And sadly, the result is that we have a
declining--we are having less and less people come to our
parks, enjoy what I call God's country, and be able to fish
because the parks are in decline. I just need you to understand
that. And my goal is to figure out how do we reverse course on
that.
Would you support any legislation or any changes where we
have the funds that are made from the park dedicated to the
infrastructure at that location?
Mr. Connor. Congressman, I think it is a great question.
We strongly support the recreational program. This year we
worked hard to make sure that we were fully funding the request
for recreation. There is legislation pending--I don't know in
the House, I know in the Senate, because I just had this
conversation in a hearing there--to consider using those funds
back in the facilities at which they are generated, those fees.
I am not in a position to endorse any legislation here. I
think it is a really good idea that we have that conversation,
Congressman, because this recreational part of the civil works
mission is incredibly important, as you just articulated.
Mr. Burlison. So, the other question I have has to do with
the issues related to land. So, you have got encroachments that
are occurring. And I had a really good conversation with
Colonel James Schultze yesterday about this, just trying to
find out, because I think that you have got to respect the rule
of law. We have to follow the laws as they are.
But we have a real-world situation where people
inadvertently, unknowingly have built structures on what is now
being surveyed under better technology, better tools, what is
described as Corps land. And our conversation about this is
that, as someone who is representing the interests of the
Federal Government and my community, I want to make sure that
we are consistent, that one neighbor is not getting a different
set of rules and guidelines than another neighbor.
And certainly, there are circumstances here that we have to
deal with. You have got some structures like a septic tank,
which would be extremely expensive to move, and then some
situations where you have somebody that had a shed that is--or
a deck, which--the costs wouldn't be that much.
So, I get it. You have to figure out some kind of
discretion in there. And so, my thought is that, can we work
together on some kind of guidance that would give a clear line
for individuals, and that if they are in that situation, they
own the land, then they could be able to maybe lease, a person
could have the choice to move their shed, or move their septic
tank, or pay an annual lease or something like that to the
Corps?
And then that might help out the other problem that we
have, which is the funding.
General Graham. Congressman Burlison, thank you for that
question, and we have encroachment challenges all across the
Corps portfolio.
In many instances, one of the authorized purposes, as you
spoke to, was recreation. And we wanted these lakes to serve as
tremendous opportunities in, as you said, God's country. And
they have succeeded magnificently. Everybody wants to be there.
And unfortunately, we didn't control where exactly the
Government property started as well as we should have.
So, General Spellmon's guidance to us is try to keep things
out of DC as much as you possibly can--and you can understand
that--and let the project manager or the district commander
make commonsense calls.
So, that is our commitment to you, is work these out issue
by issue with landowners. Our park managers out there are
absolutely committed to that. And when we have challenges that
they can't solve, they know to rapidly get them up to myself
and Mr. Connor. That is our commitment to you.
Mr. Burlison. Well, you are not--there is--you don't
believe that there is some need to change the rule or create
some kind of circumstance that can be applicable to everyone?
General Graham. So, right now I think individual solutions
to individual challenges with some more broader oversight to
make sure that we are generally consistent--now, we certainly
need to be consistent on Table Rock Lake itself. Absolutely.
Mr. Burlison. I see.
General Graham. But to take a methodology that works at
Table Rock Lake elsewhere, I would rather not.
Mr. Burlison. Thank you. I yield back. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
Mr. Rouzer. Ms. Scholten.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to the
committee for this critical discussion, discerning the path
that best leverages the taxpayers' dollars to benefit our
communities and protect critical water resources. It is one of
our highest responsibilities, and I appreciate the expertise of
all of our witnesses today.
I am so proud to represent miles of beautiful Lake Michigan
shoreline, including the coastal communities of Grand Haven and
Muskegon. Maintaining the harbor in Grand Haven, in particular,
is essential to the economy of not only Michigan's Third
Congressional District, but to Michigan as a whole. Commodities
handled by the harbor support over $3.9 billion in business
revenue, over 23,000 jobs, and $1.2 billion in labor income.
In addition, if the harbor is not maintained, commodities
that typically travel by water, including sand, gravel, salt,
cement, and manufactured goods, would have to be transported by
train and truck, which would increase annual emission rates of
over 10.5 million pounds of harmful particulate matter. The
cost to our economy, workforce, environment, and west Michigan
cannot be overstated.
This question is for Assistant Secretary Connor or Major
General Graham, whoever wants to chime in.
My staff recently had the opportunity to meet with the
local Corps representatives and learn about the work being done
to maintain the Grand Haven and Muskegon Harbors and the
surrounding area, including maintenance, dredging, and
repairing breakwaters and pier heads damaged by high lake
levels. In the event that my friends on the other side of the
aisle decide to move forward with drastic cuts to funding
level, what is the Corps' plan to finish these ongoing projects
with less funding than promised?
Mr. Connor. Well, it is difficult to do the work that is
anticipated if we are not getting the resources we need. Even
with expanded resources through the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, with the write-ins that we have had to our budget and the
annual appropriations process, it has been difficult to keep
up, particularly with some of the important but smaller ports.
And so, that is the bottom-line answer. It is very
difficult to complete these projects. We are using the tools
that Congress has provided us, advanced funding from our
partners to folks just taking on the work for expanding some of
these ports and harbors, and we will continue with the O&M. So,
there are mechanisms to try and advance the work, but they are
difficult, and they are burdensome on the local sponsors.
But stepping back for a moment, I absolutely agree. The
advantages of our waterways system in moving goods is not only
an advantage regionally within the country, it is an
international economic advantage that we have in this country
to get products out to market. So, maintaining and investing
more in our inland and coastal waterways is just incredibly
important. I absolutely agree with you. That is what I am
saying.
Ms. Scholten. Yes, thank you.
General Graham. And if I could add on?
Ms. Scholten. Please do.
General Graham. Certainly on Muskegon Harbor, we had--the
world is changing, as I said in my opening statement. We had
dredged that harbor, like, every 3 to 5 years, and now we are
finding out we have got to dredge it annually. So, we are using
emergency funds in 2023 to get that harbor back to its 29-foot
authorized depths. But climate change--a different world is
compounding the challenge you stated.
Ms. Scholten. Major General Graham, you anticipated my next
question, following up on I know the increased frequency there
in the dredging, so, thank you. We are committed to making sure
you have the resources needed to maintain that harbor.
I want to stick with you for a second and follow up on a
different project, though not in my district, critically
important to our economy in Michigan and the region, the Soo
locks project, which is so important for ensuring resiliency in
the Great Lakes navigation system by providing a second
navigation lock large enough to enable the 1,000-foot lakers to
transit between Lake Superior and the lower lakes.
The Corps' fiscal year 2024 budget requests $235 million to
continue construction of the new Soo locks in the Great Lakes.
But I understand that the Corps actually has the capability to
spend almost $630 million in fiscal year 2024 on this project.
I also understand that some of the project's costs will
have to be renegotiated if the Corps doesn't receive enough
funding for the project in fiscal year 2024, which would likely
increase the project's total cost.
How much fiscal year 2024 funding would the Corps need to
execute those expiring contract elements?
General Graham. The answer to the question--I know time is
up--is the additional capability is that $394 million that you
spoke to.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you. And if there is additional
information we need, feel free to submit it for the record.
Thank you.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Collins.
Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Secretary Connor and Major General Graham, I am the
Congressman from the 10th Congressional District of Georgia,
and my colleague and next-door neighbor, Congressman Rick Allen
from Congressional District 12, and many of his constituents,
have a very important issue. It is so important that the day I
got my committee assignments and subcommittee assignments, that
man was sitting in my office not to congratulate me, but to
identify a problem that he wanted to make sure that we put
before you, and that is with the New Savannah Bluff Lock and
Dam.
And what I am asking is I want to know if both of you will
commit to me today that the Army Corps of Engineers will work
with the stakeholders to find an acceptable solution for the
environmental mitigation required as part of the now-completed
Savannah Harbor expansion project. And specifically, any
resolution should ensure that existing water levels of the New
Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam pool are maintained as required in
section 1319 of the WIIN Act of 2016.
General Graham. Representative Collins, thank you for that
question.
And certainly, the Savannah Harbor expansion has been a
wonderful economic engine, and we have got to complete it. And
completing the mitigation measures up at New Savannah Bluff
Lock and Dam is part of that. So, you have our commitment to
continue to work with local stakeholders, with local State
officials to make sure that all voices are heard.
This is in litigation. We had some rulings earlier in this
month that I believe remanded it back that I believe has moved
us a step closer. But with ongoing litigation, this is going to
continue to be not an easy path forward.
Mr. Collins. Secretary Connor, would you weigh in on that?
Mr. Connor. Well, I am not familiar with these details,
Congressman, but to the extent that the Corps needs the support
of my office and myself and my involvement, absolutely
committed to working through these issues. This is an
incredibly important project.
Mr. Collins. Yes, sir. Thank you.
I want to shift gears here for a quick minute. I am not
sure if I am pronouncing your name right. Is it Mr. Lyash?
Mr. Lyash. Yes, sir, Lyash.
Mr. Collins. Lyash. How do you see America's industrial
base affecting the TVA's ability to continue providing power to
consumers over the long term?
Mr. Lyash. The challenge for the power industry, I think,
over the next couple of decades is going to be to support an
expanding reliance on electricity, which, by many accounts,
will double or more over the next 30 years, and to maintain
that energy security--reliable, affordable, resilient--and at
the same time decarbonize that power supply. And I think that
is going to be critical in supporting the growth of America's
industrial base. I think my fellow executives across the Nation
understand that very well.
For TVA's role in this, we have put in place plans to
expand our renewables base, expand our nuclear fleet to produce
energy, and to maintain the right balance mix to support that
economic growth and national security.
Mr. Collins. All right. Thank you.
That is all I had, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back. Ms. Wilson.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you, Chair Rouzer and Ranking
Member Napolitano, for today's hearing.
General Graham, in Miami-Dade County, we are racing against
time to move our septic system to sewer. So, I made this issue
one of my top appropriation requests so that Miami-Dade could
receive funding up to $190 million to protect countless
individuals from pathogens introduced by wastewater
contamination. When this funding is approved to assist the
county septic-to-sewer project, can the Corps commit to making
this project a top priority?
General Graham. Congresswoman Wilson, I am not familiar
with that project, but we will certainly get with the
Jacksonville District and follow up with you.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you so much. Also in your
testimony, you spoke of the Corps' intent to advance your
mission of aquatic ecosystem restoration using the President's
$7 billion discretionary funding budget.
As the Civil Works program advances its mission, I want to
bring your attention to Biscayne Bay in Miami-Dade, and the
bay's need for conservation and restoration investment,
specifically addressing propeller scars and water quality. As
the bay continues to undergo heavy boating and usage, what
steps should Miami-Dade County take to protect the bay and gain
support for restoration from the Corps?
Mr. Connor. Representative, there is a lot going on with
respect to Biscayne Bay. And associated with South Florida
Ecosystem Restoration Program, we have used the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law to fund the study for the ecosystem
protection restoration activity that we need in the bay.
In addition, we have got the coastal flood protection
activities going on in that area. So, we are resourcing those
efforts with the idea that we will get to a project
authorization timeframe for moving forward with WRDA, and we
are actively working with the local sponsors and the interested
public, as you note, to ensure that we have got the coastal
flood protection activities in place.
So, the studies, hopefully, will transition soon to
authorize programs and activities, but I just want to assure
you that this is a high priority to finish that work and get on
to the actual work on the ground that we need to do to protect
Biscayne Bay itself as an environmental treasure, but also the
communities behind the bay.
General Graham. And ma'am, if I could add that the Corps
does nothing by itself. We have a partner in everything we do.
And certainly, one of the best partners we have is the South
Florida Water Management District, Mr. Bartlett and his team
down there. I sometimes mistake some of their folks for my own
folks, the collaboration they have is so tight.
So, our commitment to you is to continue to work with the
State, with the South Florida Water Management District,
certainly with Miami-Dade to make sure that we are meeting the
needs of your constituents.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you. I will let them know
that. Thank you.
Also, Mr. Connor, communities in my district have been
battling the effects of tidal flooding and sea level rise. In
your testimony, you mentioned investments of $1.4 billion for
climate-focused construction. Can you detail the technical and
planning assistance that will address environmental justice in
communities like mine with these programs?
This is for flood and storm damage reduction for programs
that will directly benefit disadvantaged communities.
Mr. Connor. Absolutely. There is, once again, a lot going
on in this space, Congresswoman Wilson.
I issued guidance to the Corps last year which it is moving
out on which is intended to better use the programs we have,
such as the Planning Assistance to States and Floodplain
Management Services programs, where Congress has given us the
tool to be generous with respect to Federal cost share so that
we can work with economically disadvantaged and historically
marginalized communities. That is one aspect. So, reaching out
and ensuring that the communities are aware of these programs
and the opportunities is part of the process.
We are also moving forward on WRDA 2020 provisions that
allow us to do investigations at full Federal cost for
economically disadvantaged communities. We have got $30 million
available in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to move
forward with these investigations. We have just got to finish
the guidance on that, and as well as our Continuing Authorities
programs, the small programs, $10 million projects that we can
do with communities. Once again, WRDA 2020 authorized us to do
a pilot to fully fund those projects for economically
disadvantaged communities.
So, we are just about wrapped up with that guidance, and we
will use some of our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law resources to
do funding announcement and seek proposals from marginalized
and economically disadvantaged communities.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. LaMalfa.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
For General Graham and Mr. Connor, the Supreme Court
decision on Sackett--and maybe it has been talked about, but I
haven't been in this committee for other committees--but it was
really a beneficial action, and it has been a long time coming.
So, it is important because it has been so long in order to get
a rational standard for what waters of the United States would
be.
So, does the Corps plan to update your 2024 budget request
after the Supreme Court decision in Sackett? Meaning there is
probably going to be a lot less waters of the United States
work to be done, therefore, less time spent on that. Is there
going to be a budget update in that request for less work?
Mr. Connor. So, no, I am not anticipating a budget
amendment request at this point in time.
I would just like to point out that about 92 percent of the
permitting work we do under the Clean Water Act is done through
general permits. These are the nationwide permits, the regional
permits that we have in place that provide clear guidelines for
entities to--if they are only impacting small numbers of
wetlands, they can move forward under those general permitting.
Ninety-two percent take, on average, about 40 to 45 days to
complete those actions. There are 8 percent of those permitting
actions that are very significant developments that go under
individual permits, and those are the time-consuming----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. OK, all right. I appreciate
that.
Mr. Connor [continuing]. Aspects, so----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Well, the Sacramento office
seems to take a lot longer getting stuff done and delineated,
and when it comes to agricultural practices that have been
longstanding.
So, outside of these budget numbers, do you believe that
with this more rational WOTUS definition, that it will allow
more time to worry about things like flood control, General?
General Graham. Representative LaMalfa, so, certainly
clarity in what constitutes waters of the United States will be
helpful to our regulators out there.
As Mr. Connor spoke to, right now, our regulators, to meet
our standards for the general permits, 60 days to turn those is
our standard, and we are only meeting that 75 percent of the
time. On the more complex individual permits, our standard is
120 days, and we are hitting that only about 50 percent. So----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. So, now, if I didn't get my
taxes done or my DMV done at 50 percent or 75 percent of the
time, what would happen to me?
General Graham. You would be in trouble.
Mr. LaMalfa. Yes, OK. So----
General Graham [interrupting]. So, we absolutely recognize
that that performance is unsatisfactory.
Mr. LaMalfa. Yes, it is. It has taken very long for simple
things to get done.
You mentioned with Mrs. Napolitano earlier, about 7 years
so far on the manual update on Oroville Dam and others like
that. We go back to 2017, when the spillway broke, and so that
was a hot topic soon after that I have actually brought up with
your agency. So, what can we expect on getting this work done?
I think your answer to her was you have pulled people off of
that and they are working on the Sierra snowpack situation.
General Graham. Sir, we did. When I talked to the
Sacramento commander last week, the engineers that do that kind
of work are hydrologists who deal with pending flooding and the
snowpack coming down in Central Valley. He pulled those off
because he has a finite amount of that expertise to work on
that.
Mr. LaMalfa. Well, what is it you don't know about snowpack
coming down the Sierra, since it has happened for decades
during your existence there?
Tulare Lake, this isn't the first time that it has existed,
as well. What new needs to be done?
General Graham. Representative, it is dealing with the
record snowpack coming down off of the Sierras and how fast
that may or may not come down.
Mr. LaMalfa. Well, it is actually coming down on a fairly
slow timeline----
General Graham [interrupting]. It is, we are fortunate.
Mr. LaMalfa [continuing]. Compared to other, hotter years.
So, what is it that you require these resources to be pulled
off of doing things like updating this overdue manual that they
have to do now?
General Graham. So, those resources are heading back to
work on their water control manuals, as you mentioned, now that
Mother Nature is cooperating with how the snow is coming down.
Furthermore, we know that we have got to get the districts
that are overwhelmed additional resources, additional technical
resources. Either I take them from other places in the Corps or
we hire that expertise out. And that is our commitment to you.
Mr. LaMalfa. Well, with the less WOTUS responsibilities, it
would seem like you would have the resources available and pull
from that 8 percent the gentleman was speaking of.
So, can we have a better commitment that we can--in a
recent conversation you said we are still 2 or 3 years away or
more on the manual update for how our flood actions are going
to be taken on Oroville and others. Do we have a stronger
commitment of getting it done sooner, so we can manage the lake
with modern instead of 1970 data?
General Graham. Our commitment to you is to have a great
sense of urgency to get that work done as fast as possible.
Mr. LaMalfa. All right, I appreciate that, and we will be
talking. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Huffman.
Mr. Huffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to our
witnesses. Welcome to the committee.
Assistant Secretary Connor, I have some happy constituents
in the North Bay in San Rafael, where the San Rafael Channel in
my district has finally had dredging completed. And a little
further north in the Petaluma River, another one of the small
harbors and ports in the bay area that struggled to get
maintenance dredging, but we got it done in Petaluma. And in
both of these places, it has really been transformative to
watch these water bodies come back to life: the commercial
navigation, the recreation, everything that goes with it.
The only thing that people are unhappy about is they had to
wait 20 years to get maintenance dredging that was supposed to
happen every 6 to 8 years. And we are hoping that we don't have
to wait 20 years the next time around. I know that, in this
regard, I am not alone. Many of my bay area congressional
colleagues have similar frustrations at getting regular
maintenance dredging for small harbors and ports.
And there are solutions to this problem, surely including
regional cooperation between ports and the Corps to schedule
dredging together, and to work collaboratively, and also
looking at leveraging private-public partnerships or other
alternative models that will allow these dredging activities to
happen more frequently.
And we have been working on this for many years in WRDA. In
2018, we authorized you to award coastal navigation and
operation and maintenance contracts for work at multiple
harbors in the same geographic area if you determined that that
would provide cost savings compared to a project-by-project
contracting basis, which surely it will in most cases. I was
able to include some language in the 2022 WRDA to create this
authority for a regional dredge partnership in the San
Francisco Bay region.
Ports in my district and those that are in neighboring
districts don't want to have to wait until one of our ports is
20 years out of cycle for its maintenance dredge and then try
to piggyback on that contract. We want to do better.
So, Assistant Secretary Connor and Major General Graham, I
just want to ask you, before the next WRDA, it is my priority
to finalize a regional partnership agreement between the Corps
and the San Francisco Bay area small ports to either secure a
more regular dredging timeline or some equipment such as a
dredge for the region that can help us do better going forward.
Can I get your commitment to work with me and my colleagues on
this?
General Graham. Representative Huffman, absolutely. You
have our commitment to work with you on that.
I think our statistic is, of the over 1,000 federally
authorized channels, we get to about 15 percent of those every
year. So, that is going to--you know, past is prologue. That is
what we are going to see in the future, unless we do something
different.
I think one exciting area--particularly, I think San
Francisco Bay is leading the way in this--is the beneficial
reuse of dredge material. We are learning a lot by what the San
Francisco District and the local communities are doing out
there, and so, we are using about 30 percent of our material
right now beneficially, and we are working hard. Our guidance
is to get that to 70 percent.
So, we absolutely--you have our commitment to keep working
with you to achieve those goals.
Mr. Huffman. Well, I--Assistant Secretary, please.
Mr. Connor. I was just going to add demand outstrips the
resources. So, to the extent that you are giving new tools for
us to use so that we can do our business more efficiently in
partnership with others, I am all in. So, yes, you have got my
commitment.
Mr. Huffman. Thank you very much. The major general
anticipated the next question, which was about beneficial
reuse.
We have all kinds of opportunities to do that in the bay
area, and we have been trying. Every WRDA, we seem to push more
guidance, more directives at the Corps, and yet there is an
awful lot of stubborn resistance. The Corps continues to sort
of dredge and dispose of this material the way it always has:
too much ocean disposal, which is just a wasteful thing,
probably not so good for the aquatic ecosystem to dump massive
clouds of fine sediment out in the ocean near marine
sanctuaries and other places, so, we need to do better.
And I was encouraged, Major General, that Commanding
General Spellmon issued a philosophy notice in January of this
year on this subject, establishing a goal for the Corps to
advance this practice to 70 percent by 2030. It is a good
start. I hope we can do even better.
But what can we do to break through this institutional
resistance and finally realize the benefits of beneficial
reuse?
General Graham. So, General Spellmon has been pretty clear
grading my homework that I am not doing well enough, and we
have got to get up to that 70 percent.
We usually don't come up with any bright ideas here in
Washington, DC. The innovation that you seek is generated at
the local level, at the field level. And so, it is making sure
that those good ideas get past what is known as the frozen
middle, the folks with a bag of noes that pull that out.
So, our commitment to you is to try to take those bags of
noes from those people as much as we possibly can, and get to
yes to unleash the local creativity of your constituents and
our districts.
Mr. Huffman. That is great. Thanks so much.
I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Duarte.
Mr. Duarte. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You caught me by
surprise.
I certainly want to support my colleague's comments on
dredging. Mr. Huffman, Congressman Huffman, I strongly agree
with you. I appreciate you coming to bat on that.
General, this [indicating] is an excerpt from the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers Jurisdictional Determination Form and
Instructional Guidebook from 2007. It is post-Rapanos, and kind
of gives you the updated ``what to do with the split rulings
and no decision at all'' that came out of the Rapanos case. And
it has a several-page decision tree. What is a wetland? What is
not a wetland? And it is what stands today, I believe, in terms
of your delineation of jurisdictions and what and why you call
a wetland jurisdictional or not.
Are you committed, now that we have the Sackett case
ruling, to simply go through this decision tree and give some
immediate guidance on what is or isn't jurisdictional, based on
your own set of standards and the very, very clear direction
from the Sackett decision we had handed down recently?
Mr. Connor. If I could take that, Congressman, absolutely.
We are committed to moving forward, as we discussed earlier in
this hearing. We are expeditiously moving forward with a new
rule that will be consistent with the Sackett decision that
will, obviously, be more streamlined. We will take the rule we
developed in 2023. There are certain aspects of that rule, such
as significant nexus, which is represented by that matrix
there, that will no longer be applicable. So, we are fully
committed to moving forward to----
Mr. Duarte [interrupting]. Well, there are jurisdictional
delineations, verifications, farmers waiting for results, other
projects in limbo right now because the rule has been
suspended.
I think that you could report back to us in fairly short
order as to what the Sackett case completely eliminates from
this list, both in terms of significant nexus jurisdictions--
and adjacent wetlands were taken to task a bit directly, as
that was the core issue of the Sackett case was not only a
significant nexus, but it was an adjacent wetlands case that
the Supreme Court ruled on very, very clearly, and that I
believe you should be able to take this decision tree and edit
it within an afternoon and get back to us at least with a
minimal set of exclusions that would be derived from the
Sackett case.
Mr. Connor. Well, our focus is on developing that rule as
expeditiously as possible to get back into the business of
issuing AJDs. That is our intent, and that is our commitment,
sir.
Mr. Duarte. So, when this rule was developed here, it was
developed in cooperation with the Office of Management and
Budget, as well as the Environmental Quality Council. There
have also been prosecutions conducted by the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Department of Justice Division of
Water and Environment, sometimes with and sometimes without
subject matter jurisdiction.
You also cooperate and have a number of memorandums of
understanding with the USDA that advises farmers on what
wetlands regulations they are subject to and what farming
practices fit within the agricultural exemptions and the
plowing exclusions of the Clean Water Act and the section 404
permit.
The reason I really believe some immediate clarity is
important is because the significant nexus, in my opinion, was
erroneously established to begin with, and now you have got
very definite clarity. So, you might have some fine lines to
draw as to exactly where navigable waters and jurisdictional
waters begin and end, but there are hordes of wetlands in many,
many small communities and farming operations currently
hindered by your current jurisdictional claims that could be
eliminated immediately while you work on the finer lines of the
new rule.
So, I want to encourage you, as you come back for funding
this year, that you take a serious look at what can be meat-
cleavered off right now, and what advice you want to give to
some of your cooperating agencies in terms of your now newly
limited jurisdiction and what memorandums of understanding and
guidance letters are now erroneous, incomplete, or can be
completely dismissed so that farmers can go back to farming and
not wait for delineations to happen. I have waited for them for
over a year myself.
So, I would have to disagree with the good general's
characterization that anything is happening within a proper
timeframe, at least not within the Sacramento office that
Congressman LaMalfa was referring to. It is a joke over there.
It is not underresourced. It is overregulated.
Furthermore, a couple of quotes. The ``frozen middle,''
``bag of noes,'' ``individual solutions to individual
challenges,'' ``let the project manager or the district
commander make commonsense calls.'' All of these introduce a
level of subjectivity and uncertainty while you are making the
lowest level field agent a regulator and policymaker based on
his individual experience and expertise, which may be variable
and may be up to interpretation.
This [indicating a document] is objective. This is clear.
This is black and white, and there aren't very many words on
the page. I really urge you to establish a clearly delineated
decision tree as to what is jurisdictional, what is not, and
then teach your field agents to abide by it, lest they become
subject to accountability as policymakers.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr.
Garamendi.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Gentlemen, thank you for your participation today and for
the interest. Let's see, Tennessee Valley, a little far away.
The Great Lakes, even further. Let's just focus on California
for a few moments here.
First of all, in the WRDA 2020, an amendment that I had to
make water supply a co-equal task for the Corps facilities--
reservoirs, specifically--was modified by the chairwoman into a
report from the Corps that was due in June of 2022. The report
subject matter dealt with how to engage water supply with flood
control, recreation, and other activities. I believe June of
2022 was 1 year ago.
Where is the report, Mr. Connor?
Mr. Connor. The report has been delayed in the back-and-
forth between my office and the Corps, and I apologize for
that.
As I committed to the ranking member earlier, hopefully it
will be back in my office in this coming month, and I will turn
it around expeditiously and finalize and move forward with
that.
And Congressman, the report is one thing. We need to finish
our work. We need to provide the information directed to be
determined by Congress. But we are on board with the idea that
water supply and drought resilience is part of our mission. And
I identified--I put out a directive to the Corps a little less
than a year ago identifying a range of actions that were taken
to support water supply, particularly in the arid West, and we
will continue to do that.
Mr. Garamendi. There is talk, and there is action. So, I am
looking for the action. And I do appreciate the fact that some
of this is evolving. Nevertheless, that report then will
establish the opportunity for us to pass legislation here, so,
we want to get at that.
Also, Mr. LaMalfa raised the question of the operations of
the reservoirs--flood control, specifically, on the Oroville.
There is a program that, actually, Mr. Huffman started on the
Russian River that is, I believe, now in place that essentially
allowed the Corps to modify its operational book--that is, the
flood control manuals--using real-time understanding of what is
happening in the watershed.
There is no way that a 20-, 30-, 40-year-old assessment of
that watershed is applicable today. Yet, in the most--I believe
in every case, except perhaps the Russian River and the
American River in California, the old manual is the document
for flood management. We need real-time monitoring. It was
discussed. The snowpack, obviously different this year than
last year, every year is different. Real-time monitoring of
what is actually going on, the rainfall, the soil conditions,
the snow, the temperatures, all of that, it is readily
available.
I don't understand why this has not been implemented across
the entire area. If it is money and if it is direction, then
please come to us. Mr. Connor and General, if you will, opine
on why we are not doing what you need to move to real-time
monitoring.
Mr. Connor. Congressman, great question. I absolutely
agree.
I think we are in a transition period right now. And the
transition means the Corps has modified, amended its
engineering regulations so that we can take into account
forecast-informed reservoir operations, we can take into
account real-time modeling.
So, now we are in the process of getting those tools in
place. We have done, I think, three or four forecast-informed
reservoir operations pilots in California. I think one of them
we are just about complete with the water control manual
changes, and two of them, we are doing deviations----
Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. Thank you for that. I will
call you personally and go into it in detail. We don't have too
much time left here. Just know that this is a solution that has
to be put in place. I personally have been working on this for
15 years. And let's get it done. If you need money, if you need
direction, then please tell us, because it is imperative that
we move to this because yesterday is gone, tomorrow we don't
know, and we can only know if we understand in real time.
And General, the same to you. If you could, follow up on
it.
One final point in the next 18 seconds. I am sure you are
aware of Suisun Slough. Well, you are now. The Corps tried to
take it off of the Corps' work list without bothering to
contact the Congressman from that area that you were going to,
I guess, decommission that slough. Bad mistake. I am the
Congressman. You don't want to do that. I would like to have a
dredging plan for that slough in hand before too long. Too long
is within the next year.
Thank you very much. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Ezell.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Connor, I recently found out you visited the Port of
Gulfport, and I appreciate that very much. That is exciting.
Things are going on down there that--the Port of Gulfport,
which is in my district, contributes to the economic health of
the region and to the Nation.
As you know, there is a feasibility study ongoing to deepen
and widen the Federal navigation channel to Gulfport. Deepening
the channel will create economic opportunities not only for
south Mississippi, but for the entire Nation. I appreciate your
attention to this project and applaud your efforts to keep the
study going at a timely pace.
As you stated, the fiscal year 2024 budget request includes
the largest request in history. How will you utilize these
resources to keep these projects on schedule?
Mr. Connor. Congressman, first of all, could I just say I
was down at that facility, I had the great opportunity to be
there when we signed the feasibility cost share agreement. That
is an impressive facility, given not just the diversification
with respect to the goods, but the other economic activities
that the port supports and the way it is integrated into the
community. Very impressive.
With respect to the resources that we have, we continue to
recognize the need for additional resources, particularly in
the investigation side. I mean, I think Congress just
authorized another 94 feasibility studies in the most recent
WRDA. We have increased, in this year's President's budget, the
investigations funding over last year's. It is not as much as
Congress ultimately authorized. There are a lot of needs for
very strong, good projects like Gulfport that we need to move
forward on. We don't have resources in the 2024 budget, but we
are enthusiastically using the resources you provide.
So, we have expanded a little bit. We, obviously, haven't
expanded enough to meet all the needs for good projects, quite
frankly.
Mr. Ezell. Very good. Do you believe that increasing the
opportunities at underutilized ports like the Port of Gulfport
would provide environmental relief, as well?
Mr. Connor. I think the more we use our waterways,
including our ports, and the more efficiently we can move goods
through expanded capacity is good for the environment. Yes,
sir.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
I want to talk about another issue going on, and it is
important to south Mississippi. The 2019 decision to open the
Bonnet Carre spillway twice during the height of the tourist
season led to almost a total loss of our wild oysters in the
Mississippi Sound Estuary, the closure of many small and
family-owned businesses, and sent harmful algae blooms into the
gulf and out into the beaches. It was terrible.
In January, U.S. District Judge Guirola ruled in favor of
the Mississippi Gulf Coast, stating the Corps is ordered to
consult with the National Marine Fisheries Service regarding
the impacts of the spillway openings, as required by MSA
[Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act]. Has
the Corps started these consultations, and if not, when can we
expect them to do that, Mr. Connor?
Mr. Connor. I know there is an ongoing dialogue about our
operation of the Bonnet Carre spillway, and I am not sure of
the specific actions taken as a result of the litigation at
this point in time.
I do know that this is part of the reason we have just
kicked off the Lower Mississippi River comprehensive study. We
are looking at the system as a whole to understand whether it
is operating as it was originally intended. And if not, how do
we restore capacity, and how do we address the new challenges
that we see environmentally?
If we are going to have those high flows requiring spillway
operation, what do we need to be doing on the Atchafalaya, as
well as how do we need to be looking at the system differently?
So, in that aspect we are not just working with the States
and local partners, but bringing in other agencies. That will
be part of that dialogue, I am just not sure specifically what
we have done as a result of the litigation, sir. But we can get
back to you on the record.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you. It was good to see that the Corps
issued a statement that announced the beginning of the Lower
Mississippi River comprehensive management study. Thank you for
doing that.
And can you please include the communities, especially some
of these business owners who lost everything as a result, and
get these folks involved in these conversations?
Mr. Connor. Absolutely.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you. Thank you again for your leadership
on these issues. We will have some more questions in the
future.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman. Mr. DeSaulnier.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Major General, I want to just acknowledge Brigadier General
Gant, who came to my office. I represent--there are a lot of
Californians on this subcommittee--I represent a very large
part of the San Joaquin Delta, and have for many years. She was
great. She came in, and we talked about beneficial use that--a
lot of history on. So, I wanted to acknowledge her and your
team out there, they are doing good work.
And your acknowledgment of the work that State and locals
have done on this issue in the San Francisco Bay, but
specifically in the delta, the largest estuary west of the
Mississippi.
Secretary Connor, I just sort of wanted to talk to you
about coordination and the need for coordination between State,
Federal, regional, and local jurisdictions, in particular my
experience in California and representing the delta. And just
sort of coincidentally, I don't know if you saw the New York
Times today and the headline story on the front page, extensive
story, ``The Trillion-Gallon Question: Extreme Weather Is
Threatening California's Dams.'' I don't know if you had a
chance to see that.
Mr. Connor. I did see the headline.
Mr. DeSaulnier. I just want to read you a quote from it
from a former head of the U.S. Geological Survey. He said, ``
`The peak of record' ''--that is, their look at climate change
in these extreme weather events--`` `is driving a lot of
engineering decisions in the state,' he says, and that peak is
an underestimate, maybe a gross one: `Already, we are seeing
several 100-year floods every 10 years.'
``Some of this miscalculation,'' the story goes on,
``arises from our failure to account for climate change, a
problem that will only get worse as the atmosphere heats up and
the amount of water vapor it can carry increases.'' Geological
Survey experts said `` `All of this infrastructure is designed
for a climate that no longer exists.' But the error also lies
in our understanding of the past. Most of the flood data that
form the basis for the design of California's dams''--and
infrastructure, I would add--``come from the past century,
which was an unusually placid period in the state's weather.''
So, my question to you is, having been involved in climate
change on the air quality side and representing this area, so
important for our water infrastructure is the coordination
between the State and the Federal agencies.
I recently had a meeting with the Bureau. We are trying to
get a record of decision on the Los Vaqueros Reservoir, 30
years of work, including with my predecessor who represented
the area, and was chair and ranking member of the Natural
Resources Committee here in the House for years, George Miller.
We have agreement from the environmental community, from the
business community, from the water community. We are having
problems getting the governmental agencies.
So, how are you working with other Federal agencies and
with State agencies in California in light of this most recent
article, but, for instance, on Los Vaqueros? Now we are worried
about that specific project getting involved with the
peripheral canal, which I am told is in the middle of
conversations that will change momentarily in the budget and
the legislature, all of these issues about coordination.
Major General, your comments about the bag of noes--when we
are not coordinating it gets easy for mission creep in
different agencies at every level. So, how are we coordinating,
given the urgency of this, what I just quoted to you, that
although we have had years to plan for this, we are not
prepared, and we are letting bureaucracy get in the way of
this? How are we coordinating with other Federal agencies and
with State agencies in this instance?
Mr. Connor. I will try and be brief because it is a huge
issue that you have just articulated.
One, we are very fortunate in California to have a great
partner--and particularly for the Corps--the Department of
Water Resources. So, I do believe that we are integrating the
best science that we have about the future challenges that we
have, particularly as we design a number of flood control
projects with the State as our local sponsor. We are looking at
the increased levels of flows that are projected, given the
dynamics of the climate change. That is why we have an R&D
initiative in our budget.
And so, with respect to new project development, we have
got a great partner with the State to look at that science and
to integrate new features, engineering with nature so that we
are not just trying to control Mother Nature as much as use it
where it is appropriate.
Two, with respect to operations--I think General Graham
referred to this earlier--one of the things we have been doing
with the record snowpack this year is monitoring that snowpack
on a day-to-day basis, hour-to-hour basis, and we have been
able to do that because California has instituted new
aggressive modeling of the snowpack using lidar, continuous
information that allows us to, day to day, assess the
likelihood of significant runoff, and that helps us manage our
reservoirs and manage potential flooding in the Central Valley.
So, we have got to have the best science available. We have
got to up our game with respect to the coordination with the
State and across Federal agencies. An example that we need to
do more is this forecast-informed reservoir operations.
Mr. DeSaulnier. I will jump in here because my time is
expired, and I want to be respectful of the time. I want to
talk to you more about this, as do other Members of the
delegation. The urgency, people's lives, and the U.S. economy
is at stake. Thank you.
Mr. Ezell [presiding]. The Chair now recognizes Mrs.
Gonzalez-Colon.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you
to the witnesses for coming here, and I need to say that I am
really happy to have here the Corps of Engineers and the rest
of the witnesses. Especially, I want to acknowledge Assistant
Secretary Connor and General Graham from the Army Corps, which
has been a critical partner for Puerto Rico in very challenging
situations.
And I welcome you every time in Puerto Rico. So, I want to
say thank you. I really believe that you are one, if not the
top, Federal agency that actually does things in Puerto Rico in
a timely manner. And that is something when you get hit with
hurricanes, and you are still going through the recovery of the
island. So, I want to say all people and staff from the Army
Corps have been very critical for the redevelopment of the
island. And I need to say this because you may not have the
same experience in other States, but yes, in Puerto Rico, we do
appreciate all the hard work of the Army Corps.
And having said that, I need to acknowledge as well that,
as General Graham just mentioned, the formation of the special
task force for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico to help speed
that rebuilding and overcome implementation obstacles. I mean,
it has been more than 5 years after the hurricane, and many of
the processes were stalled--not in the Army Corps, but general
permits in the Federal agencies, local agencies. And having
that task force being implemented for the U.S. Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico will help us expedite a lot of the permitting,
a lot of the issues that were unsolved during the last years.
So, I want to say thank you. I do recommend that should be the
way to go with many Federal agencies in the recovery process of
the islands. So, thank you for that.
And this is going to be my question. One important--and
this is for Secretary Connor and General Graham--one important
concern of mine is the effect, as we discussed privately
before, of the inflation and supply chain cost increases on the
ability of the Army Corps to complete authorized projects.
Projects are already started or are in planning stages. For
example, Puerto Rico, Rio Puerto Nuevo, Rio La Plata, Rio
Guanajibo, Rio Nigua, Guayanilla, and many others will end up
with a real total cost significantly greater than was
originally authorized or appropriated.
My question will be, how will the Corps of Engineers
address this?
Do we have to go through the whole reauthorization process
and reappropriation process all over again, and maybe even
bring the projects to a stop while we do it, or do we reduce
the projects and leave phases undone, or split those phases to
have to go through the whole process of reauthorization and
appropriations all over again?
I don't know what your recommendation is going to be, but,
I mean, if this process must change, how should we change it?
General Graham. Certainly, thank you for that question. And
thank you for the kind words for the Jacksonville District and
South Atlantic Division standing up a standalone task force to
deal with the magnitude of work down there. Ms. Jackie Keiser,
the senior civilian on that, is the best we have got, and she
is absolutely committed to deliver for your constituents.
As part of our FEMA work, we have got folks on the island
right now, because we thought that that tropical storm--begins
with a ``B''----
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon [interposing]. Bret?
General Graham. It was heading your way, and so, we got a
power response team--PRT--right there, right now in response to
that. In addition, we have got the additional FEMA power
generation that is spinning right now supporting grid
resiliency on the island.
And to your to your question directly, we have got
controllable and uncontrollable cost increases out there.
Inflation is running somewhere between 25 to 40 percent. And as
you spoke to, we are going to have to deal with those
realities. There are some controllable cost increases that are
our responsibility. And most of those, when we pull the thread
back and get to the root cause, it is the design wasn't as
mature as we would have liked it to have been when we were
given a funding opportunity window. And that is our
responsibility.
So, the systemic piece that the Corps has to do better on
is our cost estimates that are sitting on the shelf have to be
updated.
So, where we are at today with the Puerto Rico work, I
would say generally the costs are absolutely going to go up,
particularly on those big three projects that you mentioned.
When you get down to Rio Puerto Nuevo, when you walk through
that, we have done a lot of flood risk management in urban
areas. And with that ancient city, that is about as difficult
as it possibly is going to get.
So, our commitment to you is to put everything on the table
as transparently as we can, and communicate with you when we
see these challenges and the magnitude of the challenge. We
should have certified cost estimates, particularly on those big
three projects, back, ideally, next month. And Jackie will be
paying you a visit.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you. I know my time has expired.
I will submit some other questions for the record, and thank
you for your good work.
I yield back.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Cohen.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate you allowing
me to waive on to the subcommittee, as I have some issues I
would like to discuss with our TVA president, Mr. Lyash. So,
thank you, sir.
Firstly, I would like to just say this has been a great
opportunity to listen to some of our Members' questions, some
of the officials here, and ask for assurances and guarantees,
and they have all given assurances and guarantees. So, I think
this is teeing us up real well.
You know that the Federal Government would like to have a
zero net carbon policy by 2035. TVA is at 2050, if I understand
correctly. Can you assure me that you will get it down to 2035?
Mr. Lyash. Thank you for the question. It is always a
pleasure to see you, and I enjoy----
Mr. Cohen [interposing]. Thank you.
Mr. Lyash [continuing]. Our conversations on this and other
topics.
Yes, TVA's goal is, as many other utilities, to get to net-
zero carbon by 2050, and we would like to go farther faster.
So, we are taking every available action to add carbon-free
resources to the system. We have been focused on optimizing our
hydroelectric fleet, expanding our nuclear capability, adding
aggressively renewables like solar and wind to the stack, as
well as storage, which is important.
And we are focused on doing this while maintaining energy
security. And by that I mean affordable, reliable, and
resilient power for our customers, and decarbonizing----
Mr. Cohen [interrupting]. Let me stop you for a minute,
because I kind of know--I have heard most of this speech
before.
Mr. Lyash. Yes.
Mr. Cohen. You have got three gas plants that you have got
online to build at Cumberland, Kingston, and Cheatham, new
natural gas plants. You plan to go along with those three new--
--
Mr. Lyash [interrupting]. The Kingston project is still
under evaluation. We have issued a draft environmental impact
statement, and we are taking public input on that currently, as
well as trying to update that analysis to reflect the potential
impacts of the IRA. So, that is----
Mr. Cohen [interrupting]. That is good on Kingston. How
about Cheatham and Cumberland?
Mr. Lyash. Cumberland, the final environmental impact
statement has been issued, and the board's decision was to
retire those coal units, and to replace that critical capacity
with a gas-fired combined-cycle plant, and that project is
underway.
Mr. Cohen. So, that is going to contribute to putting off
2035 to 2050, your net zero.
Mr. Lyash. Yes. The retirement of the Cumberland coal units
and the replacement gas is about a 60-percent reduction in the
carbon emissions from those sites. Over time, as we deploy
additional renewables, and hopefully additional nuclear, we
would expect to be able to operate less gas and have it as a
capacity resource, and use less energy, thereby reducing our
carbon over time.
Mr. Cohen. The price of natural gas has gone up because of
the Ukraine-Russia war, et cetera. Does that affect the cost of
gas that TVA buys, as well?
Mr. Lyash. It does, although because 60 percent of our
energy comes from sources that really have zero carbon and zero
fuel cost, there is a natural hedge in the diversity of our
portfolio.
We rely about 28 percent on natural gas, so, when the price
goes up we do see that impact. We saw that price go from about
$3 in MMBtu to as high as $12 or $15. It is currently back to
$2.50, sort of pre-crisis levels. In the long term, though, we
do expect upward price pressure on that natural gas----
Mr. Cohen [interrupting]. So, does that make it less of a
good investment to take Cumberland and Cheatham and make them
into natural gas plants, rather than go into more alternative
types of energy that are net zero?
Mr. Lyash. I think the answer is we need to do all of
those. We are adding solar as fast as we can obtain access to
panels. So, the constraint there is supply chain.
The natural gas, simple-cycle, and combined-cycle plant are
flexible, dispatchable, and resilient, so, they represent a
capacity resource, even if----
Mr. Cohen [interrupting]. Let me stop you here. I have got
just 50 seconds left, and I am getting the impression I am not
going to get an assurance that we are going to get down to net
zero by 2035.
Mr. Lyash. That is our objective.
Mr. Cohen. It is your objective?
Mr. Lyash. Our goal, our objective is to move that net-zero
performance forward as far as fast as we can. What we have said
is we have line of sight to get to 80 percent by 2035.
Mr. Cohen. Let me ask you this. The TVA Act clearly
requires disclosure of TVA employee compensation.
I have asked you on many occasions to give us TVA salaries
and disclose that information. You have not done it. Why do you
refuse to give out the salaries? We know your salary, which is,
give or take, $10 million this year. Is that correct? Nine
million dollars?
Mr. Lyash. Yes, $8 million.
Mr. Cohen. $8 million, yes.
Mr. Lyash. Yes.
Mr. Cohen. But how about all the other employees that earn
$1 million or more, we have requested their salaries. You have
never released those. Why is that?
Mr. Lyash. We were required by the Securities and Exchange
Commission----
Mr. Cohen [interrupting]. You were required by the TVA Act
to disclose TVA employee compensation.
Mr. Lyash. Yes, and that provision of the act we complied
with by submitting the required report to the Congress and the
White House for many years. The requirement was changed as part
of a record reductions effort, and we were requested to stop
providing that report several years ago. And so, that is no
longer required.
We do provide a comprehensive compensation disclosure to
the Securities and Exchange Commission, which lays out the
entire----
Mr. Cohen [interrupting]. But that is not the people that
created the TVA. That is not what the TVA Act requires. And
that is just not right, Jeff. It is not right. You are part of
the Government. You are created by the United States
Government. You are part of it. Salaries should be
transparent----
Mr. Ezell [interrupting]. The gentleman's time has expired.
Mr. Cohen. And when people are making over $1 million, the
public ought to know who they are and what they are doing.
Mr. Ezell. The gentleman's time has expired.
Mr. Cohen. Thank you.
Mr. Ezell. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Graves.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am just
going to start out with my friend, Mr. Cohen.
Mr. Lyash, I had no intention of asking you any questions,
but I am going to say that I am going to associate myself with
Mr. Cohen's comments. Your position is unsustainable. I just
want to be very clear. You are a Government entity. Your
position is unsustainable.
Mr. Lyash. I am sorry, can you repeat the question?
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. It is not a question. I am just
telling you your position is unsustainable if you are not going
to provide him the information he is asking for. You are a
Government entity. You need to provide him the information. And
I would just give you a little counsel there. I just strongly
urge you to do it. Otherwise, you are going to be compelled to
do it. And you can either cooperate or it is going to get a
little ugly. I would urge you to comply with his request.
Secretary Connor, thanks for being here. I saw that look on
your face when you heard that salary number. You were thinking
that was pretty close to yours, right?
[Laughter.]
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. So, first of all, I want to thank
you for the funding decision on Bayou Sorrel lock, and just
dealing with the bureaucracy there. We don't need to get into
it. I will just say thank you. I appreciate you doing that. I
think it does cut through some of the redtape and allow us to
move forward on that project. There is still a long way to go,
but we will be able to move forward on that project in a more
efficient manner, saving significant dollars. So, thank you for
that.
Look, the other thing I want to bring up that is really
important, I heard General Graham just make reference to a
figure of 25 to 35 percent inflation. Mr. Secretary, you and I
have talked about the Comite project. This project dates back
to the early 1980s. We fully funded the project back in BBA
2018, based on the Corps' numbers. And gosh, I would love to
have a 25- to 35-percent inflation rate on that project.
Unfortunately, depending on which number I choose, we are
probably looking at about a 300-percent inflation rate, based
on the initial BBA allocation. We are looking at a 200-percent
or so inflation rate based on the resiliency funds that we
grabbed a few years later.
The bottom line is, I just want to hear you update us on
that project, or one of you update us on the project, and give
me a commitment that you are going to finish this thing. Look,
half of a diversion structure doesn't do any good.
General Graham. Representative Graves, first, thanks for
the question. And I absolutely agree with the cost increases at
Comite. There is a report at the edge of my desk that my Chief
Engineer looked at that said, ``How did we get here?'' So, as
you spoke to inflation, understandable, the uncontrollable
pieces, 25 to 30 percent, but a doubling, if not more, of the
cost. How did we get here?
And what the report says is the challenge with benefit-to-
cost ratio. So, they engineered this as far as they could. This
project has been in design for a while. So, what does that
mean? They engineered, basically, a grass ditch. And then, for
the step-down structures around the bayous, they put those--
because it was all they could afford under the benefit-to-cost
ratio--basically, gabion structures relatively on grade.
And so, when we built that first section down along the
river, shockingly, it didn't perform all that well. The grass
channel didn't hold up, and the structure started to sink. So,
we realized that, OK, that was too much risk to take with the
engineering. It has got to be multiple courses of geotextile
reinforced stone, and we can't use gabion structures. They are
going to have to be truly engineered structures on pile
footings.
So, you could say the path to damnation was paved with good
intentions. They worked as hard as their engineering would
allow them to get to--for the benefit-to-cost ratio, but we
realized that the engineering just wasn't sound enough. So, we
own that. We absolutely own that.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. All right.
Mr. Connor. Congressman, can I just add just real quickly?
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Please.
Mr. Connor. We are making huge decisions based on bad
information, and we need to make sure our cost estimates are
best, are updated on an ongoing basis. And we need to make sure
we have taken them far enough along in the design process to be
representative of good, accurate numbers.
And so, I think General Graham and General Spellmon are
committed to ensuring we learn lessons, and we update, and we
have the resources to update these cost estimates because we
are creating problems ourselves----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. And your commitment
to finish the project.
Mr. Connor. We are absolutely committed to finishing the
project, because we----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interposing]. Thank you.
Mr. Connor. The worst of all worlds is an unfinished
project.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Amen. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
General, real quick, I know you recently went to Morganza
to the gulf project. We have worked together to come up with
this new design using local material, native material. I just
want to make sure that you remain committed to allowing the use
of local material to build that levee, saving literally
billions of dollars.
General Graham. Absolutely.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. OK, look, I have got a gazillion
other things. I am just going to say that we continue to have
issues on HPS crediting. We continue to have issues on the SELA
deferred payment agreement. We are looking at over $100 million
in interest a year because of the Corps' delays in
renegotiating that. The committee, on a bipartisan basis, has
asked for information on how you are spending your IIJA
regulatory funds. We haven't heard anything back.
I am going to submit stuff for the record.
Thank you all for being here. I could keep you here all
day. Take care.
Mr. Ezell. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Burchett.
Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member
Napolitano, probably one of the kindest Members of Congress--I
will go on the record and say that--Mr. Graves, Mr. Cohen.
My first question actually dealt with this, Mr. Lyash, and
I would like to go a little further. The Tennessee Valley
Authority employees, they are Federal employees, and Federal
employees' salaries are public information. I would like you to
answer to me not in lawyer terms, but just reality. Why aren't
TVA salaries or pay tables public?
Mr. Lyash. Yes. Congressman, thank you for the question,
and I respect the perspective.
As I said, TVA is required by the act to maintain
competitive compensation benchmark to the industry. We make an
attempt in our compensation disclosure document to
comprehensively disclose the framework and the objectives, the
metrics that are used to determine compensation. And we
disclose the senior executive salary.
We don't disclose, you are correct, the entirety of TVA
employee salaries. And the reason here is that we operate in a
very competitive market for these resources: engineers, nuclear
operators, security specialist personnel. And so, if we are not
required to, disclosing that information publicly puts us--
would put us at a very significant disadvantage----
Mr. Burchett [interrupting]. Well, let me stop you there.
Mr. Lyash [continuing]. In the market.
Mr. Burchett. How is that any different from any other
public entity? A school board, I mean, they are competing in
Knoxville, Tennessee. Everybody is competing with Oak Ridge
National Laboratory if you are a skilled tradesman. But yet we
know how much they are making, and I am not seeing the problem
there.
So, explain that to me. How can that be? They can always
just call them and say, ``How much are you making? Would you
like to make this much more?''
Mr. Lyash. Yes. Again, Congressman Burchett, we strive to
comply with all the requirements and the regulations. We
believe we are, and we don't believe that disclosing this
compensation is in the interest of TVA or the people that we
serve, and would put us at a competitive disadvantage.
Mr. Burchett. I would submit to you it is in the interest--
--
Mr. Lyash [interrupting]. That is the reason. I understand
we may not agree on----
Mr. Burchett [continuing]. I would say it is in the
interest and the spirit of the law, if--I am not an attorney,
but I know Congressman Cohen is, and I believe he would agree
with me on that.
I tell you, I am not really getting a favorable answer from
you on that. I am going to be preparing some legislation to do
just that to clarify the situation. And I hope that some of my
Members across the aisle would be in support of that.
Let me ask you about Winter Storm Elliott. TVA completed
over 250 near-term actions to improve coordination,
communication, and preparedness. Are you all prepared to handle
another extreme weather event?
Mr. Lyash. The short answer is yes. May I amplify?
Mr. Burchett. Please.
Mr. Lyash. Yes, Winter Storm Elliott was, really, a once-
in-a-generation event. The combination of a low-temperature,
systemwide temperature drop, freezing, and wind put much of our
facilities, a number of our facilities, outside their design
basis. And so, a lot of the corrective actions you cited were
designed to change that design basis and harden those
facilities against extreme weather events--not just cold, but
we looked at heat, inundation, drought, cyber attacks. So, we
are taking a comprehensive review at resiliency.
Because it also put the entire Eastern U.S. in the same
position, and our peers suffered largely the same effects, it
created a situation where others were having to curtail us on
firm power. And so, the question of reliance on off-system
resources is a strategic issue we have looked at. And so, we
are adding a significant amount of generation to the portfolio
to reduce that reliance.
We are working with local power companies, as well, who had
their own set of lessons learned in their performance, and
helping them to do better.
So, in short, if we had the same event today, Congressman,
you would see a significantly different result. But it is our
accountability not to stop there, but to look at the whole
family of these events.
Mr. Burchett. I would remind you that you all did put out a
tweet prior to that that we were in good shape, basically. And
then, when it went out, you told everybody to start cutting
power. So, I would hope in the future that that would be the
case.
You all currently hold about $20 billion in debt. I believe
that is correct. Is it?
Mr. Lyash. That is correct.
Mr. Burchett. Can you all continue paying down this debt
while making these new energy investments?
I know Congressman Cohen had some concerns as well as I do,
even with these rising interest rates.
Mr. Lyash. Yes.
Mr. Burchett. And will it affect the ratepayers?
Mr. Lyash. Yes, we have been successful in reducing our
debt down to $20 billion. And with $51 billion worth of assets,
that is a strong balance sheet. So, I don't see the need to
further reduce that debt at the expense of customer rates.
But the second part of your question is, given what TVA and
other utilities face over the coming decades, we will have to
invest a substantial amount of money to meet load growth to
reach environmental objectives, as Congressman Cohen stated,
and that will require funding that will have to flow from debt
and rates, the appropriate combination of the two. That is part
of the reason why we pulled forward and launched a new
integrated resource plan that we will stakeholder over the next
year to lay out a 20-year view of what must be done and what it
will take. And then that will inform the financial plan to
answer exactly the question you are asking.
Mr. Burchett. OK. I would like to end on this. I know I
have run over, but if you all got a problem with me, I would
appreciate you getting with me. I don't appreciate any time
when somebody calls me out to the woodshed. And you can let
your board members know that, as well. Because when somebody
calls me from my community that I know has been in contact with
somebody over there, and they are reading me the riot act, I
don't appreciate it.
Mr. Lyash. OK.
Mr. Burchett. And I will leave it with that.
Mr. Lyash. Congressman, I would like to----
Mr. Burchett [interrupting]. And you can pass that on to
your board members.
Mr. Lyash. Yes, thank you.
Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you. The gentleman yields back.
Are there any further questions from any members of the
subcommittee who have not been recognized?
Seeing none, that concludes our hearing for today. I would
like to thank each of the witnesses for your testimony.
I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing
remain open until such time as our witnesses have provided
answers to any questions that may be submitted to them in
writing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 days for any additional comments and information
submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in the record
of today's hearing. Without objection, so ordered.
The subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:34 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Appendix

----------

Questions from Hon. David Rouzer to Hon. Michael L. Connor, Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Department of the Army, and
Major General William H. ``Butch'' Graham, Deputy Chief of Engineers
and Deputy Commanding General, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

Question 1. Masonboro Inlet has been the historical borrow site for
renourishment projects at Wrightsville Beach in my district and
protects the navigation of the inlet while allowing a lower cost option
for the Corps and local communities. Unfortunately, due to poor policy
decisions by the Fish and Wildlife Service, the project has been
delayed and project costs have skyrocketed. In the wake of Hurricane
Ian, the conditions of the beach have only been made worse.
I appreciate that Army Corps headquarters ultimately allowed the
Wilmington District to make the decision to move forward using the
inshore borrow site. Before the Wilmington District is able to move
forward to utilizing the site, they must first have the approval of the
remaining balance for renourishment through the Flood Control and
Coastal Emergencies Account, requiring approval from the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB).
Please detail when you expect funding to be approved to complete
the Wrightsville Beach renourishment project.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2. In 2017 the Corps prohibited non-Federal entities from
disposing of dredged materials in a Corps facility unless it had
``excess'' capacity ``for the project's life.'' Recently the guidance
was changed to ``20 years'' of capacity, a decision made in response to
a Texas spoil site that was found to be at capacity.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ See Memorandum, from Thomas P. Smith, Chief, Operations and
Regulatory Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ``Policy
Clarification Memorandum for Placement of Dredged or Excavated Material
in Federal Navigation Project Dredged Material Placement Facilities
(DMPFs) by Non-Federal Interests and Others Pursuant to Section 217(b)
of the Water Resource Development Act of 1996, Public Law 104-303, as
amended (33 U.S.C. Sec. 2326a(b)),'' (Jan. 9, 2023) (on file with Comm.
on Transp. and Infrastructure).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, this has resulted in a blanket rule for all spoil
sites nationwide, even where it doesn't make much sense. For example,
in my district the City of Southport cannot deposit spoil material for
the Southport Boat Basin because the Corps spoil site DA277 is
unavailable. Those in Southport, Holden Beach, and other nearby
communities must spend additional resources to transport materials to
other spoil sites, increasing project costs and timelines.
Question 2.a. This decision was made following a single spoil site,
at which frankly the Corps seems to have a poor job managing capacity.
As such, what is the reasoning behind the Nationwide blanket assumption
of ineligibility?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2.b. What is the process for determining the 20-year
capacity number, and at what level is that decision made? Is there a
process for communities to appeal the determination of incapacity?If
so, please describe the process. If not, please explain why communities
do not have the opportunity to appeal this determination.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 3. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) was passed in
1982, which designates undeveloped coastal barrier islands for
inclusion in the Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS). These
designated areas are ineligible for certain Federal financial
assistance that may support development, such as National Flood
Insurance, VA loans, and shore protection projects conducted by the
United States Army Corps of Engineers.
A portion of North Topsail Beach, designated as Unit L06, was
deemed undeveloped, and therefore included in the CBRS. However,
significant infrastructure existed in L06 before the CBRA's passage,
including roads, sewer, electric, public water systems, and a high-rise
bridge connecting the island to the mainland. The population of the
town is estimated to be nearly 30,000 during the summertime.
The rest of the town and other towns on the island are not included
in the CBRS. Topsail Island Includes three towns, Topsail Beach, Surf
City, and North Topsail Beach. Topsail Beach and Surf City were
``developed'' in 1982. Later, the United States Fish & Wildlife Service
designated two sections of North Topsail Beach as ``undeveloped.''
Please explain how infrastructure can only be in the Northern and
Southern ends when the utility lines are continuous throughout the
Town. If there is no explanation, please describe the steps that will
be taken to correct the incorrect designation.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 4. The Army Corps has stated officially, ``To the extent
the Non-Federal Sponsor accomplishes nourishment of private beaches
outside of the Federal cost-shared project, they can use their locally
preferred method and will pay 100 percent of the costs. Easements in
areas where Pinellas County, Florida, chooses to pay 100 percent of the
costs can be temporary and not perpetual, as these parcels constructed
solely at the Non-Federal Sponsor's expense cannot be integral into the
Federal project reach. Anything integral to the Federal project must
have permanent easements to protect the integrity of the Federal
measure and benefits.'' \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Email from Chief, Future Directions, Branch, Headquarters,
United States Army Corps of Engineers to Staff, Representative Anna
Paulina Luna, (Mar. 15, 2023 11:55 p.m.) (on file with Comm. on Transp.
and Infrastructure).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the Corps accepting contributed funds, the non-Federal
sponsor could pay 100 percent of the cost using temporary easements if
those areas are not ``integral'' to the Federal project reach.
Question 4.a. Please define which areas are considered ``integral''
to the Sand Key Beach project in Pinellas County, FL?.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 4.b. Additionally, describe which properties still need a
perpetual easement.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 4.c. Finally, please detail which properties/areas are
locations where temporary easements be accepted.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 5. How many jurisdictional determinations are affected by
the Corps' pause on jurisdictional determination issuance following
Sackett v. EPA?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 6. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)
provided $160 million to assist the Corps with its regulatory programs.
Question 6.a. What is the status of this effort?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 6.b. Can you describe whether it has resulted in a faster
pace of reviews and permitting? If not, what steps is the Corps taking
to more efficiently conduct reviews and issue permits.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 7. How many Chief's Reports are expected to be signed and
submitted to Congress by the end of 2023?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 7.a. Similarly, how many Post-Authorization Change Reports
(PACRs) do you expect by the end of the year?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 7.b. Also, how many Chief's Reports and PACRs are expected
for 2024?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 8. When do you expect the Section 7001 project report to
be submitted?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 9. Enbridge Line 5 is an important energy pipeline for the
upper Great Lakes region. In March 2023, the Army Corps pushed back the
schedule for completing the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for
the Great Lakes utility tunnel, a safer proposed 30-inch pipeline
housed in an underground tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac, until
2026.
Does this timeline comply with recently passed legislation to
streamline permitting processes under the National Environmental Policy
Act? If not, please describe the steps that will be taken to comply
with these streamlining provisions.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 10.a. What percentage of Corps projects and feasibility
studies are completed on time?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 10.b. What percentage of projects and feasibility studies
are completed at or under budget?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 11. Section 8130 of the Water Resources Development Act of
2022 required the Corps to identify barriers that impede the beneficial
use of dredged material and recommend policy changes to Congress to
improve beneficial use no later than one year after enactment.
Question 11.a. What is the status of complying with this provision?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 11.b. Will the Corps meet its deadline described in this
provision?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 12. Farmers, shippers, and industry depend in the
Institute for Water Resources' Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center
(WCSC) to provide accurate and up-to-date information on our inland
waterways. Currently the WCSC is operating on a Microsoft DOS system
that is roughly three decades old, leading to delays in providing
information, include for more than three months last year. What is the
Corps' plan to modernize the system to provide accurate and reliable
data?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 13. Section 1154(a) of the Water Resources Development Act
of 2018 directed the Corps for a report of all operations and
maintenance project backlogs, with the first report due in 2020. What
is the current status of this report?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 14. How does the Corps intend to process Clean Water Act
(CWA) permits in a manner that supports the efficient use of taxpayer
dollars and ensure timeline certainty for critical infrastructure and
mine projects, which are at the front-end of the supply chain for
critical infrastructure projects and energy technologies?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 15. In 2019, the Corps issued a CWA Section 404 permit to
the PolyMet (now NewRange Copper Nickel Mine) project located in the
Duluth Complex, one of the world's largest undeveloped accumulations of
copper, nickel, and platinum group metals. However, in June 2023 the
Corps revoked the permit.
Question 15.a. The Corps revoked the permit four years after
issuing without any violations occurring. Please explain the logic, if
any, supporting the decision to revoke the permit.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 15.b. How does revoking permits for critical
infrastructure mining projects align with the Administration's
priorities?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 15.c. The Corps said that NewRange can reapply for the
permit. Currently, it takes on average 7-10 years to permit a mine.
With the Corps pausing jurisdictional determinations, how long do you
reasonably expect this reapplication process to take?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 16.a. Does the Corps plan to provide any submitted
comments during the 60-day comment period to the Proposed Rule Revising
the Endangered Species Act Section 7 Regulations by the Fish and
Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 16.b. Can you describe how these revisions would directly
impact Records of Decision and other National Environmental Policy Act
actions already supporting Corps mission authorities for flood and
navigational operations and Congressionally authorized projects that
impact river basins?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Questions from Hon. Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon to Hon. Michael L. Connor,
Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Department of the
Army, and Major General William H. ``Butch'' Graham, Deputy Chief of
Engineers and Deputy Commanding General, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

Question 1. Some of the major ongoing projects in Puerto Rico were
launched after Hurricane Maria under the auspices of the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2018, under which they were to be funded at 100% federal
share. However, as mentioned in the hearing for most if not all the
real cost will be much greater than what was estimated in 2018:
What happens now? The project was expected to be fully completed AD
federally funded at 100% with that allocation but if that cannot
happen, do we restart the whole process? Does it then become again
subject to local shares?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2. How does overall inflation and cost increases also
affect the evaluation of projects that communities apply for? One often
hears of a community like Orocovis or Canovanas in Puerto Rico that
explored projects under the Continuing Authorities Program, but ended
up exceeding the dollar limit or not meeting the cost-to-benefit
calculation.
Will the Corps eventually, or does it already, need a higher total
resource level and higher individual project authorizations for those
programs?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 3. In some of the cases in Puerto Rico part of the issue
is authorizations and appropriations were made based on data from
before the project was approved, sometimes long before.
Is there a need for us to legislate or authorize a process by which
estimates can more effectively reflect the changing costs environment?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 4. We noticed a reduction in the investigations account in
the proposed budget.
Question 4.a. How does this affect the response to what at least in
my district is an increasing number of requests to study possible coast
erosion, flood control or such situations? Does this mean the ``queue''
of applications and proposals grows longer? That fewer requests will
end up approved?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 4.b. Is the study required for federalization of operation
and maintenance at the Port of Yabucoa, which was authorized in the
current WRDA, affected by this?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 5. Puerto Rico has experienced firsthand the phenomenon of
repeated and intensified natural disasters. We have observed how
critical it is for the communities to be able to get back on to a
recovery footing quickly.
What initiatives are included in the Budget for building community
resiliency?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Questions from Hon. Garret Graves to Hon. Michael L. Connor, Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Department of the Army, and
Major General William H. ``Butch'' Graham, Deputy Chief of Engineers
and Deputy Commanding General, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

Regarding the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018:
Question 1. The Comite Diversion Canal received full funding in the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. However, we now understand that because
of inflation, we only have half the funding needed to finish it. This
project is different than a levee in that it doesn't provide interim
protection if it's half complete, it is nonfunctional until the entire
system is done. How is the Corps ensuring that there will be no work
stoppage on the Comite Project?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2. What is the Corps doing to ensuring that projects that
received full funding in the past will be completed, including the West
Shore and East Baton Rouge projects?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 3. Had the Corps been faster to build projects from the
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, instead of waiting years after the
funding was provided, these projects would have been less susceptible
to inflationary conditions. While Congress must grapple with
identifying funds to backfill these cost increases, the non-Federal
sponsors are left holding the bag for cost shares that are sometimes
double what they had originally agreed to. How will your office support
non-Federal sponsors in meeting their cost-share obligations?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.
Regarding HPS crediting:
Question 4. WRDA 2022 continued to affirm the ability for the State
of Louisiana to receive credit for the related work it has done with
respect to the New Orleans HPS including through the transfer of excess
credit.
The state continues to seek approval of its application for credit
through the Sec. 1020 authority. Can you provide a status update on
USACE's review of that application?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.
Regarding the Lower Mississippi River Study:
Question 5. We are encouraged that the PBUD has continued to
allocate funding toward this effort. The intent of this study is to
provide a foundation for the Corps to operate the Mississippi in a
comprehensive manner, recognizing that Corps assets can be managed for
multiple benefits. (For example, a river control structure can not only
be operated to regulate the flow of water in the system, it can also be
operated to provide additional ecosystem benefits when needed.)
Question 5.a. Can you describe in detail the actions USACE will
take in 2023 to fully initiate this study, as well as advise how states
can provide input into the process?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 5.b. How will the Corps ensure that the study
revolutionizes the management of the Corps' multiple lines of business
comprehensively, instead of in individual silos?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 5.c. Will the Corps be considering updating operations
manuals for its existing assets as part of this study, as intended?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 6. The explicit requirement to utilize existing
information is intended to ensure that the Corps is able to leverage
high-quality data at the lowest possible cost. How will the Corps
utilize existing data from states and other non-government entities, as
well as strategic investment plans like the Louisiana Coastal
Masterplan to inform the study?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 7. Is the $25 million authorization level sufficient to
accomplish the goals of the study as authorized by WRDA 2020?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 8. This study also authorizes additional studies,
including feasibility studies, if the Secretary determines that they
warrant additional analysis. How will the Corps determine if additional
studies are needed to complement the LMR effort?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 9. The LMR study also includes a requirement that the
Secretary submit an annual report of any interim actions undertaken to
support the goals of the study under existing authorities as well as
any recommendations to Congress developed in that annual period. This
interim reporting requirement was meant to ensure that Congress did not
need to wait for the study to be completed in full in order to take
necessary actions to support a modernized approach to the Mississippi
River in the WRDA process. Stating it another way: LMR is intended to
provide a long-term vision while also allowing for incremental
improvements to existing management processes. How does the Corps
intend to make incremental improvements and recommendations while the
study is ongoing?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.
Regarding SELA interest renegotiation:
Question 10. CPRA Chairman Chip Kline wrote to ASA in September of
2022 requesting engagement to renegotiate interest for the SELA
Project, pursuant to Sec. 351 of WRDA 2020.
In May, we were made aware that you had responded to Chairman Kline
stating that you had ``directed USACE to complete a review'' of the
request.
We submitted these questions to the ASA team on May 16; however, we
have never received a response despite numerous follow ups.

Asst. Secretary Connor:

Question 10.a. What was ASA doing between September when the
request was sent, and April when the ``review process'' was begun?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 10.b. What does this review process consist of? How long
will it take? Which official or office is conducting the review?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 10.c. The Corps stated that no implementation guidance was
necessary on this provision when WRDA 2020 was enacted. There was no
review process for the implementation of Sec. 351 WRDA 2020 authorities
as they relate to the WBV and LPV projects. So, what necessitates the
need for review for the SELA project?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Maj. Gen. Graham:

Question 10.d. What role is the Corps taking in this review
process? Is there any additional information you would like to add?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question from Hon. Mike Bost to Major General William H. ``Butch''
Graham, Deputy Chief of Engineers and Deputy Commanding General, U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers

Question 1. As the T&I Committee is considering funding levels for
the U.S. Army Corps activities for FY24, this Committee has asked for a
report of all operation and maintenance backlog of projects within the
Corps. This `request' was directed in Section 1154(a) of WRDA 2018 with
the first report due in 2020. Why has the report not been filed and do
you expect to produce this report within adequate time for this
committee to make healthy funding considerations?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question from Hon. Doug LaMalfa to Major General William H. ``Butch''
Graham, Deputy Chief of Engineers and Deputy Commanding General, U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers

Question 1. General Graham, in California's First Congressional
District, project work along the Feather River in the Sutter Basin has
resulted in excess credits. In partnership with the California
Department of Water Resources, the Sutter Butte Flood Control Agency
(SBFCA) is working to utilize these excess credits by transferring them
to another project in the State. This transfer is in-line with
Congressional intent from previous WRDA bills in 2014 and 2016. The
goal here is for us to have an executed project partnership agreement
amendment by May of 2024--which might seem like a far way off, but I
know you are well aware of the long timelines for each step of a
project.
Can you and General Spellmon commit to assisting my office and
SBFCA to make sure we can stay on track, hit the project milestones,
and get an executed PPA by next May?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Questions from Hon. Garret Graves to Major General William H. ``Butch''
Graham, Deputy Chief of Engineers and Deputy Commanding General, U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers

Regarding Morganza to the Gulf:
Question 1. Maj. Gen. Graham, as you heard during a recent visit to
Louisiana, a pivotal strategy to reducing the cost of constructing the
Morganza to the Gulf system is to allow for borrow material to be
sourced from local resources. This drives down cost by providing ample
opportunities to identify materials.
Maj. Gen. Graham, are you committed to providing the requisite
flexibilities regarding borrow material sourcing for this critical
project? What is USACE doing to provide these flexibilities?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.
Regarding Southwest Coastal:
Question 2. Now that a Project Partnership Agreement has been
signed for the Southwest Coastal project, will USACE prioritize
providing funding to the NER project component? Will USACE consider
shifting allocated funding to see a better balance between addressing
the NED and NER?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.
Regarding Permanent Canal Closures & Pumps:
Question 3. USACE has responded quickly and transparently to the
corrosion issues identified within the Permanent Canal Closures & Pumps
in the New Orleans HPS.
Maj. Gen. Graham, can you detail to this Committee what funds the
USACE has available this fiscal year to address the issues in the
immediate to ensure pumps work during hurricane season and for next
fiscal year to implement a permanent fix?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.
Regarding Mitigation Banking Delays:
Question 4. Compensatory mitigation through approved mitigation
banks and in-lieu fee programs, as opposed to applicants performing
their own mitigation, is supposed to substantially decrease the time it
takes for USACE to approve Clean Water Act Section 404 permits--while
ensuring high quality environmental outcomes. However, a recent
analysis of timelines associated with decisions for mitigation banking
instruments indicates USACE is taking years to approve them--on
average, 1.5 times longer than the 225 day requirement. This delay
negates the Corps' ability to take advantage of this tool to increase
permitting efficiency. What is USACE doing to remedy the delay in
mitigation banking Instrument approval?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.
Regarding Permitting Technologies:
Question 5. It is our understanding USACE is working on the
development of an electronic joint application permitting system. When
do you anticipate the system being online and what are the anticipated
benefits of the system? For example, will the system allow for
electronic submission of Clean Water Act Section 404 permit
applications or supporting documents such as jurisdictional wetland
delineations or mitigation banking and in-lieu fee instruments?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 6. Are there other ways USACE is embracing the use of new
technology in Section 404, or other, permitting work or allowing
applicants or mitigation providers to make use of new technology?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question from Hon. Emilia Strong Sykes to Major General William H.
``Butch'' Graham, Deputy Chief of Engineers and Deputy Commanding
General, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

Question 1. In response to Representative Scholten's question
during the hearing asking how much FY24 funding for the Corps' Soo Lock
project capability for FY24 would be required to fund construction
contract options that are set to expire by the end of FY24, you
responded by saying that the USACE could expend all of the difference
between the requested amount and the capability amount during FY24 if
funded.
Since this response didn't really answer Representative Scholten's
question, please tell us how much FY24 funding for the Soo Lock project
would be needed to fully fund all construction contract options that
expire by the end of FY24 so the price for those options would not have
to be renegotiated?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Questions from Hon. David Rouzer to Jeffrey J. Lyash, President and
Chief Executive Officer, Tennessee Valley Authority

Question 1. Please describe TVA's energy strategy on long-term grid
dependability.
Answer. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) maintains one of the
largest, most diverse, reliable and cleanest generation systems in the
nation. We are committed to maintaining the characteristics of this
system as we work to meet rising customer expectations, electrification
and economic growth. After nearly a decade of flat growth, we are
experiencing unprecedented increases in electric load across the TVA
service territory.
To meet this new growth in the region, we are aggressively
investing in generation--solar, gas, energy storage, and nuclear--and
working with industry and local power companies on demand response
efforts and expanded energy efficiency programs. We are currently
building more than 3,800 MWs of new generation that includes solar,
energy storage, combustion turbines and combined-cycle natural gas.
This is enough power to serve as many as 2 million homes and helps TVA
maintain reliability.
Additionally, we plan to invest $2.8 billion in transmission system
improvements between 2023-2027, including our new state-of-the-art
Primary System Operations Center (SOC). The new SOC will employ smart
technologies to manage power grid operations more reliably and
efficiently. The center's energy management system will provide more
flexibility by integrating and monitoring distributed energy resources
(small-scale resources that connect to the power grid at individual
locations) and demand response (which enables customers to shift
electricity usage to non-peak hours in return for incentives). The SOC
also will feature robust security systems to ensure our assets are
protected from everything from cyberattack to an electromagnetic pulse.
It is expected to open in 2024.
TVA also works directly with its 153 local power companies (LPCs)
to advance grid reliability for the future. For example, the Regional
Grid Transformation (RGT) initiative is a collaboration between LPCs
and TVA to transform the power grid into a more resilient, flexible and
integrated system to meet customer expectations and changing world
conditions. Working together, the partnership can understand and
implement the grid-related initiatives necessary to address current and
future needs of the TVA service region.
The RGT released a Strategic Roadmap \1\ in August 2022 which
highlights the regional opportunities and capabilities needed to
achieve grid transformation, and it also released a Tactical Roadmap
\2\ in April 2023 which highlights the individual actions and
anticipated timelines of example tactical roadmaps from LPCs and TVA.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TVA's Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) \3\ serves as a compass for
how to best meet forecasted energy demand in the coming decades. The
comprehensive study includes TVA describing resource needs, policy
goals, physical and operational constraints, risks, and proposed
resource choices. The IRP process is critical in ensuring we are
seeking input from our customers, stakeholders, and the public in
preparing energy options to serve the Valley long term.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ https://www.tva.com/environment/environmental-stewardship/
integrated-resource-plan/2019-integrated-resource-plan
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most recent IRP was completed in 2019 and has served as the
basis for TVA's asset strategy over the course of the past four years.
In recognition of the pace of change occurring in our industry and the
dynamic growth we are experiencing in the Valley, we launched our next
IRP this year, and it is slated to be complete in 2024. We are
exploring options for future power generation with a focus on
innovation, reliability, resiliency and environmental stewardship.
The stability of our regional economies and the lives of the people
we serve depend on a safe, secure energy supply, and TVA is committed
to an energy strategy that provides long term grid dependability.

Question 2. How does TVA's debt compare to other private utilities
and Federal Power Marketing Administrations in the United States?
Answer. TVA works to fulfill its mission of supplying low-cost and
reliable energy, providing environmental stewardship, and stimulating
economic development while effectively managing debt and living within
its means. In achieving its mission while following sound financial
principles, TVA generally uses financing to fund capital investments
for new generation capacity and environmental controls. TVA's use of
debt allows it to spread the costs of capital investments over the
lifetime of those investments, rather than charging existing customers
the entire costs of these investments up-front. In addition, bonds and
notes are generally the lowest-cost form of financing available to TVA,
making them the most fiscally responsible choice for our ratepayers.
TVA has the authority per the TVA Act to issue bonds, notes, and
other evidence of indebtedness subject to a $30 billion limit,
sometimes referred to as TVA's statutory debt limit. While the $30
billion limit on bonds and notes has not been raised since 1979, TVA's
business and operations have continued to grow along with the power
needs of the Tennessee Valley. Since 1979, TVA has increased its total
assets from $13 billion to $51 billion as of September 30, 2022. With
growing power demand across the TVA service territory, there will be a
need for additional investment in assets in the near-term. Other public
power entities with statutory debt limits have experienced similar
changes to their systems and needs. For example, Bonneville Power
Administration (BPA), a large federal power marketer, recently received
a $10 billion increase to its borrowing authority with the U.S.
Treasury.
It is important to note that TVA borrows in the public capital
markets, and TVA's bonds are not guaranteed by the federal government.
TVA's bonds and notes do not count against US Treasury borrowing
limits, and new bonds would not burden the US Treasury's borrowing
needs.
TVA serves a critical role in the nation's infrastructure, with the
responsibility of managing the Tennessee River system, and functioning
as the largest public power provider in the US, supplying power to 10
million people, businesses and industries in the seven-state Tennessee
Valley region. TVA also operates the third largest operator of nuclear
power plants in the U.S.,, performs an important role in supporting
national defense and executes a crucial part in maintaining the
reliability of the eastern power grid.
Despite TVA's large size and scope, financial comparisons show that
TVA does not use more financing to fund its power system investments
than public or private peer utilities. In fact, TVA's debt levels are
low in comparison to other public power utilities. Comparing the debt-
to-equity ratios of TVA and public utility peers, TVA's ratio of 1.68
is among the lowest (see Figure 1). Since 2018, TVA's debt/equity ratio
has been at or near top quartile among this peer group.

Figure 1

TVA's debt levels also perform well among public power peers in
comparisons of debt to capacity and debt to total sales. Though TVA is
a much larger entity, both ratios are generally better. (See Figure 2)

Figure 2
[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Source: 10-K filings and S&P Global

As compared to investor-owned utilities, TVA compares even more
favorably, with the lowest debt to capacity and debt to sales ratios as
compared to regional peer holding companies (see Figure 3).

Figure 3
[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Source: 10-K filings and S&P Global

TVA's balance of total financing obligations (``TFOs''), which
includes statutory debt and other financing obligations, decreased by
$0.2 billion in FY 2022. This reduction, which follows a FY 2021
reduction of $0.9 billion, has allowed TVA to achieve its lowest debt
level in over 30 years. As of September 30, 2022, TVA had $19.3 billion
of bonds and notes outstanding.
TVA's strong financial health enables access to low-cost debt
financing for future investments in the power system. TVA is committed
to its statutory mission to provide power rates as low as feasible, in
part, through its use of the statutory debt authority, but it is also
bounded by that same debt limit. As the Tennessee Valley region
continues to experience growth at six times the national average due to
in-migration, on-shoring of domestic manufacturing, and
electrification, extensive new capital investments in generating
capacity and environmental controls will be necessary. As discussed, it
would be most prudent to utilize low-cost financing for these future
investments if TVA's borrowing ability were to allow for this option.

Question 3. As TVA looks to the future of its power generation
system, what is the contribution of your existing nuclear fleet to your
asset planning?
Answer. Nuclear power is the best option for generating large
amounts of electricity that's safe, clean, reliable, and cost-
effective--allowing us to keep our rates competitive and reliability
high.
TVA operates the nation's third-largest nuclear fleet, which meets
approximately 40% of the energy needs of TVA's service territory. TVA
operates seven nuclear plants at three sites, which generate enough
low-cost, clean, and reliable energy to power about a third of our
customers--more than 4.5 million homes and businesses.

Question 3.a. How are you also building in new nuclear energy
technologies?
Answer. TVA continues to evaluate emerging nuclear technologies,
including small modular reactors, as part of technology innovation
efforts aimed at developing the energy system of the future. While TVA
actively works to extend the life of our existing reactors, we are also
taking steps to be able to add next-generation nuclear power, such as
advanced light water small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced non-
light water reactors, to the TVA portfolio. TVA's goal is to identify
an economically viable advanced nuclear technology to generate carbon-
free electricity in the 2030s and beyond.
In February 2022, TVA's Board of Directors announced the launch of
TVA's New Nuclear Program and approved up to $200 million to explore
advanced reactor technology options to help meet its clean energy
goals. The New Nuclear Program provides a disciplined, systematic
roadmap for TVA's exploration of advanced nuclear technology, both in
terms of various reactor designs being proposed and potential locations
where such facilities may be needed in the region to support future
energy needs--as outlined in TVA's Strategic Intent and Guiding
Principles.\4\

documentc67079e2-d479-4f3d-a13b-1fa6fd714cde.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TVA's New Nuclear Program is looking at a variety of advanced
nuclear technology options that might help meet both our near- and
long-term generation needs including SMRs. SMRs are advanced reactors,
such as the BWRX-300, with an electric generating capacity of up to 300
MW, in contrast to an average of about 1,000 megawatts for existing
commercial reactors. Some SMR designs, such as the BWRX-300, use
elements of proven technology and new innovations that simplify
construction, maintenance, and operations to achieve a cost efficient
and reliable design. These designs can also leverage the existing
nuclear supply chain, including fuel supply, to increase cost
effectiveness and reduce risk.
TVA has the nation's first early site permit for SMRs from the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for the Clinch River Nuclear Site
in Roane County, Tennessee. Advanced reactor designs under evaluation
for the Clinch River Site Advanced Nuclear Technology Park include both
light-water and non-light-water cooled reactors, with more than a dozen
vendors providing TVA detailed information to support the Programmatic
Environmental Impact Statement. Light-water reactor technology is
considered most ready for deployment near-term. TVA's New Nuclear
Program is preparing an NRC construction permit application for a BWRX-
300, small modular reactor at the Clinch River Nuclear Site, subject to
required environmental reviews and Board approval.
TVA's efforts are supporting a path from first-of-kind technology
deployment to cost effective commercial deployment at scale, but
additional support and collaboration will be needed.

Question 3.b. What are the benefits of nuclear to your generation
system, especially in times of increasing electrification and demands
in your system?
Answer. Nuclear energy is carbon-free and can run 24/7. It plays a
critical role in generating power that is both reliable and affordable
for the 153 local power companies and 57 industrial customers that TVA
serves. Last year alone, TVA had three nuclear units that ran
consecutively from one refueling outage to the next (between 18 and 24
months depending on the technology), providing megawatts to the grid
24/7 during that time.
Carbon-free nuclear is essential to our energy supply as we work to
electrify the economy, drive down customer costs and eliminate
emissions. Advanced nuclear technologies, like small modular reactors
(SMRs), have the versatility to serve as baseload power or as a
complement to renewables.

Question 4. The Committee has discussed the risks of China and
other countries surpassing the United States in critical technology
areas, such as nuclear.
Question 4.a. Can you describe the importance of deploying
technologies successfully at home before competing in global markets?
Answer. Deploying SMR technology successfully in the U.S. will
position the U.S. to compete with foreign adversaries by deploying
civil nuclear technology internationally, including by establishing the
supply chain for exports. Russian, and increasingly Chinese,
technologies are outcompeting the U.S. for deployment of nuclear energy
technologies on the international market. The risks of being
outcompeted are not limited to commercial competition but extend to
U.S. geopolitical and national security interests. Each new nuclear
plant is a firm lever of influence for our adversaries that lasts for
the 80-100-year life of a nuclear plant. What is more, the country
exporting the technology is able to drive the safety and security
standards of the various components.
Building a North American or nationally centered supply chain
promotes energy security and drives U.S. innovation and economic
growth. TVA is already working within an international collaboration
agreement to advance the design of the BWRX-300, which could result in
further global deployment of the technology with the supply chain based
in North American.

Question 4.b. How is TVA helping to enable deployment of new
nuclear technology domestically?
Answer. TVA is well positioned to serve as a catalyst that launches
widespread adoption of new nuclear generation III+ technology that will
serve as a flexible, reliable, scalable source of clean energy
benefiting our customers and all Americans. As highlighted in the
Department of Energy's Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Advanced Nuclear
report, deliberate action by both the public and private sectors is
needed now to advance new nuclear U.S. industry growth and increase
national security and economic competitiveness. Utilities are ready and
capable of building and operating nuclear power plants, positioning the
utility industry at the forefront of facilitating the commercial
deployment of new nuclear technology. Multiple new technologies will
likely emerge as viable over the next several decades, and Generation
IV reactors will play an important role in nuclear deployments in the
longer term.
In the near-term, advanced Generation III+ new nuclear technologies
are the most likely to immediately unlock domestic industry growth and
international exports. TVA has taken significant steps to be a first
mover in deploying Generation III+ technology through its Clinch River
Nuclear (CRN) Project near the Department of Energy Oak Ridge
Reservation in Roane County, Tennessee. These steps include:

Securing the nation's first and only NRC early site
permit for an SMR at the CRN Site.

Establishing a new nuclear program approved by the TVA
Board of Directors and supported by a $200 million investment.

Working toward an NRC construction permit application for
a BWRX-300 SMR at the CRN Site, the submission of which is subject to
required environmental reviews and Board approval.

Developing a contractual Integrated Project Delivery
Model (IPD), an industry success model based on lessons learned to
ensure shared accountability and support the delivery of projects on
time and on budget consistent with the DOE Liftoff report and Electric
Power Research Institute standards.

Conducting a study to identify locations beyond the CRN
Site that may be suitable for future SMR deployment using guidance from
EPRI's Advanced Nuclear Technology Siting Guide.

Collaborating with federal and state partners to ensure
the Tennessee Valley area supports the workforce and supply chain needs
of new nuclear technology commercialization to position the region and
United States as a global industry leader.

TVA has also joined with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH), Ontario
Power Generation (OPG) in Canada, and Synthos Green Energy (SGE) in
Poland in a historic investment of around $400 million to enable the
kind of innovations necessary to develop the first GEH BWRX-300 small
modular reactors for the US, Canada and Poland. This is a historic
partnership that spans three countries and two continents. By
collectively investing in the development of the BWRX-300 standard
design and the detailed design for key components of the reactor, we
are utilizing our partnership to reduce risk and enable a faster and
more cost-effective deployment of new nuclear technology in the U.S.
and throughout the world.
TVA has taken these significant steps because we believe advanced
nuclear technologies will play a critical role in our region and our
nation's drive toward energy security and a clean energy future--
focusing on reliability, affordability, resiliency and sustainability.
Using light water technology, such as that in the GEH BWRX-300 SMR
design, builds on the success of earlier light water technology and has
significant innovations but fewer first-of-a-kind features, which
should greatly improve reliability while minimizing new risks. Existing
boiling water reactor (BWR) technologies have a mature supply chain
that could support the development of new BWR technologies. Moreover,
TVA brings BWR operating experience to the partnership, and the
expertise from completing the construction and safe commercial online
operation of Watts Bar Unit 2 in 2016.
To enable deployment of new nuclear technology domestically, an SMR
must be successfully licensed, constructed, and operationalized in the
United States, and the right partnerships need to be in place to
quickly capitalize on the opportunity to deploy additional units. TVA
is laying the groundwork to be a first mover, but bringing a domestic
first-of-a-kind (FOAK) SMR technology online is inherently expensive
and comes with unique costs. Any first utility mover will need direct
investment in the first units to offset first-of-a-kind costs and
decrease uncertainties and risks to help enable fast followers. Waiting
to deploy the technology will only make deployment more expensive; DOE
estimates that waiting just a decade to launch will increase costs by
as much as 50%.\5\

At a pivotal moment where we have the opportunity to reshape the
future of American energy with Generation III+ new nuclear, TVA is
putting the necessary parts in place to serve as the catalyst that
launches widespread adoption of this carbon-free energy source. TVA
looks forward to keeping the Committee updated on progress at the
Clinch River Nuclear Site and discussing federal support opportunities
to enable domestic deployment at commercial scale.

Questions from Hon. David Rouzer to Adam Tindall-Schlicht,
Administrator, Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation,
U.S. Department of Transportation

Question 1.a. How does GLS work with its Canadian counterpart, the
St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation, to manage the locks of the
Seaway?
Question 1.b. Does Canada pay its expected share and maintain its
sections of the system properly?
Answer to 1.a. & 1.b. The St. Lawrence Seaway was built in the
1950s as a binational partnership between the United States and Canada
through international agreements that carry the weight of treaties and
continues to operate in that manner. Administration of the binational
waterway is shared by two entities, the GLS in the United States and
the Canadian St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation (SLSMC), a not-
for-profit corporation established by the Government of Canada in 1998.
The two Seaway corporations communicate regularly at every
organizational level, to include the intentional integration of
operational efforts and collaboration on policy making. The geography
of the St. Lawrence Seaway necessitates this close collaboration as
vessels transiting from Montreal to Lake Ontario cross the
international boundary 27 times. Both Seaway corporations also continue
to meet regularly to strategize and develop joint initiatives to
address four common objectives: to manage the waterway as one seamless
system for its customers; to increase trade; to improve economic
competitiveness; and to increase customer satisfaction. The St.
Lawrence Seaway has been a model of binational cooperation for more
than 60 years.
The GLS operates and maintains its two locks in Massena, N.Y., with
appropriated funding. The SLSMC charges tolls to Seaway commercial
users to fund the operations and maintenance of its 13 locks, which
include five locks on the St. Lawrence River and eight locks at the
Welland Canal connecting Lakes Ontario and Erie. The St. Lawrence
Seaway has a historical reliability rate of 99 percent due largely to
funding levels being sufficient to properly operate and maintain the
locks and channels of the binational waterway and address
infrastructure renewal.

Question 2. As a wholly owned Federal government corporation, GLS
possesses certain powers uncommon to most Federal agencies. These
include the ability to generate non-federal revenues, own and sell real
property, borrow money, and make and carry out certain contracts or
agreements necessary in the conduct of its business.
Question 2.a. How have these authorities made GLS operations more
efficient?
Question 2.b. Are there any additional opportunities available to
GLS to increase its non-Federal revenues to help meet the growing costs
of Seaway operations?
Answer to 2.a. & 2.b. Like most Federal government corporations,
the GLS performs a business-like function in the public interest. As
such, government corporations are given expanded authorities to
generate funding to address unexpected or unplanned operational and
preventative maintenance needs. This flexibility has allowed the GLS to
fund necessary operational and infrastructure projects to maintain its
near-perfect reliability rate.
Since its creation in 1954, the GLS has generated offsetting
collections primarily from rental payments of tenants at its facilities
in Massena, N.Y., pleasure craft tolls, concession operations, and
interest payments from its investments in the government's Minority
Bank Deposit Program. The GLS has not identified any additional
opportunities to increase future offsetting collections. It is worth
noting that beginning in FY 2024, the GLS will no longer generate
rental payments as its final tenant at the Administration Building
relocates to another location in New York State.
