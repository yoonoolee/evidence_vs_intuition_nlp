II. BACKGROUND

Commuter rail means ``short-haul rail passenger
transportation in metropolitan and suburban areas usually
having reduced fare, multiple-ride, and commuter tickets and
morning and evening peak period operations.'' \1\ It typically
operates with higher-speed, higher-capacity trains with less-
frequent stops and traveling longer distances than transit
rail, and can operate on shared right-of-way with freight
rail.\2\ The average trip length on commuter rail measures 25.6
miles.\3\ While the most heavily traveled commuter rail systems
are in the Northeastern United States, 28 agencies operate
commuter rail that service 25 states and Washington, D.C.\4\ In
2021, commuter rail agencies employed approximately 33,000
workers responsible for operations, maintenance, capital, and
general administration.\5\

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, commuter rail
ridership dropped to roughly 66 percent from the previous
year's ridership as office commuters worked from home.\6\ While
ridership has improved since the pandemic's end, the numbers
remain below 2019 pre-pandemic figures. Specifically, commuter
rail trips in 2019 totaled 510,443, while trips in 2023 totaled
316,293, or 62 percent of pre-pandemic numbers.\7\

III. COMMUTER RAIL FUNDING AND OPERATIONS

OPERATING COMMUTER RAIL

The way that commuter rail service is provided can vary.
For instance, some commuter rail agencies operate their own
service over track the agency owns, and others contract with
freight railroads for access to their track and dispatching
services.\8\ Several commuter agencies also partner with Amtrak
for various services.\9\ Other agencies contract out their
operations and/or other services to private sector
providers.\10\ All shared use of rail corridors is based on
voluntary agreements negotiated on a case-by-case basis to
address corridor- and service-specific issues.\11\

Commuter Rail Commission (SunRail); CTrail in Connecticut;
MARC; Shore Line East; and Sound Transit in Washington, as well
as maintenance-of-way and dispatching services for
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).\13\ Amtrak
also provides access to its tracks (and in some cases, other
services) for 10 agencies, including: CTrail; Long Island Rail
Road; MARC Penn Line; NJ Transit; Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority (SEPTA); Delaware Department of
Transportation; Rhode Island Department of Transportation;

SAFETY OVERSIGHT AND FUNDING

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is responsible
for ensuring the safety of commuter rail through inspections,
regulatory actions, and other operating practices.\16\ While
FRA regulates safety, Federal funding for commuter rail is
generally provided by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).
Commuter rail agencies are eligible to receive FTA formula
funds, including funding under 49 U.S.C. Section 5307
(Urbanized Area Formula Grants); 49 U.S.C. 5337 (State of Good
Repair Grants); and 49 U.S.C. 5340 (High Density States Formula
funds). These formula funds typically go to a regional
transportation agency, the designated recipient, and are
allocated by regional agreements to various transit agencies
operating commuter rail, heavy and light rail, streetcars,
ferries, and bus transit in the same urban area.\17\ The
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (P.L. 117-58)
authorized approximately $33.5 billion for Urbanized Area
Formula Grants; $23.1 billion for State of Good Repair Grants;
and $1.8 billion for High Density State Formula Funds from
fiscal year (FY) 2022 through FY 2026.\18\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally, commuter railroads may compete for
discretionary grants under FTA's Capital Investment Grant (CIG)
program, which funds capital investments in commuter rail as
well as heavy and light rail, street cars, and bus rapid
transit projects.\19\ IIJA authorized $23 billion for the CIG
program over five years.\20\ Six commuter rail agencies are
currently in the CIG pipeline seeking $12.2 billion.\21\
Commuter railroad authorities may also compete for
discretionary grants under the Department of Transportation's
Local and Regional Assistance (RAISE) and National
Infrastructure Project Assistance (Mega) grant programs,
although eligibility under Mega is limited to public
transportation projects done in conjunction with another
mode.\22\ IIJA advance appropriated $7.5 billion and authorized
an additional $7.5 billion for the RAISE program and advance
appropriated $5 billion and authorized an additional $10
billion for the Mega program over five years.\23\

RAILROAD CROSSING ELIMINATION (RCE) PROGRAM

IIJA authorized $600 million in annual advanced
appropriations over five years, totaling $3 billion, to create
the new RCE Program to address safety concerns at highway-rail
or pathway-rail grade crossings Nationwide.\24\ The grant
program is administered by FRA and is open to projects that
would separate or close grade crossings; would relocate tracks,
install or improve protective or preventive measures at
crossings such as signs or signals; and funds planning and
designs for eligible projects.\25\ Eligible recipients include
states, political subdivisions of states, United States
territories, Indian Tribes, local governments, port
authorities, and metropolitan planning organizations.\26\
Commuter rail grade crossing projects qualify for this program,
with the ability for FRA to transfer qualifying commuter rail
projects to the FTA to administer.\27\

RAILROAD REHABILITATION AND IMPROVEMENT FINANCING PROGRAM

The Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing
(RRIF) program was originally established by Congress in Title
V of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of
1976 and later amended in the Transportation Equity Act for the
21st Century (TEA-21).\28\ RRIF offers long-term, low-interest
loans for improving rail infrastructure, including for commuter
rail.\29\ RRIF-eligible projects include: acquiring, improving,
and rehabilitating track, bridges, rail yards, buildings, and
shops; preconstruction activities; transit-oriented development
projects; and new rail or intermodal activities.\30\ RRIF loans
can cover up to 100 percent of a project's cost, with repayment
periods of up to 35 years.\31\ Under this program the
Department of Transportation (DOT) is authorized to provide
direct loans and loan guarantees up to $35 billion to finance
development of railroad infrastructure.\32\ To date, the RRIF
program has provided $7.3 billion in financing.\33\

IV. COMMUTER RAIL CHALLENGES AND CONCERNS

FUTURE FUNDING

In May 2023, the American Public Transportation Association
(APTA) surveyed its members on future potential operating
budget shortfalls, also known as the ``Fiscal Cliff'' that many
agencies are facing.\34\ Fifty-one percent of 122 responding
agencies say they are facing a Fiscal Cliff in the next five
years.\35\ Commuter rail authorities have expressed support for
predictable Federal funding, to fully fund IIJA public transit
and passenger rail investments in annual appropriations bills,
including for CIG, RCE, and Federal-State Partnership for
Intercity Passenger Rail grants.\36\ Additionally, commuter
railroad agencies have requested funding for the operations and
maintenance costs of positive train control, a safety
communications system Congress mandated for passenger and
freight lines carrying certain hazardous materials in 2008, and
that safety requirements placed on freight railroads in
additional rail safety legislation are not inadvertently borne
by commuter rail agencies.\37\

AMTRAK PREFERENCE AND ACCESS RIGHTS

Certain commuter rail interests have questioned whether
Amtrak has access rights to rail lines that were not in
operation when Amtrak was created, and whether it has
preference over commuter rail lines as it does over freight
railroad-owned lines.\38\ The agencies assert commuter rail was
never subject to the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (RPSA)
(P.L. 91-518) that granted Amtrak a right of track access or
preference on track not owned by Amtrak.\39\ The Commuter Rail
Coalition (CRC) argued that as ``non-RPSA'' railroads, commuter
railroads were not relieved of their passenger common carrier
obligations under the RPSA.\40\ Therefore, they harbor no
obligation to give Amtrak preferential treatment on commuter
railroad tracks and that doing so would burden publicly-funded
commuter rail operations.\41\ The CRC stressed the need to
``continue to realize the full, long-term value of the public
investment'' \42\ in commuter lines and facilities ``to protect
their valuable passenger service.'' \43\

Officer, Commuter Rail Coalition to Martin J. Oberman, Chairman,

Amtrak stated that the access rights granted to Amtrak in
RPSA do apply to commuter rail and that the Surface
Transportation Board (STB) and its predecessor, the Interstate
Commerce Commission have consistently held that the RPSA
applies to both ``railroads'' and ``regional transportation
authorities.'' \44\ Amtrak stated that it does not have
statutory priority on commuter rail lines, as it does on
freight railroad routes, though does claim it is generally an
international best practice for transportation agencies to give
some level of priority to intercity passenger rail trips over
local trains when they run on the same tracks.\45\ Amtrak
further asserted that commuter rail can benefit from Amtrak's
presence on commuter tracks because Amtrak can access certain
FRA grants for shared-use infrastructure that commuter
railroad-only projects usually cannot, such as the Consolidated
Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) and
Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail (FSP)
Grant Programs.\46\ Additionally, Amtrak claimed that a number
of the commuter railroad-owned lines that carry Amtrak service
were acquired after its creation with knowledge that Amtrak had
statutory rights of access.\47\

ACCIDENT LIABILITY INSURANCE

Most commuter rail agencies self-insure against risks
between $2 million and $7.5 million.\48\ In order to insure
against larger losses, commuter rail agencies purchase policies
from the private markets. Total annual price increases on
premiums have ranged from 20 percent to 80 percent in the past
five years.\49\

In 1997, Congress enacted the Amtrak Reform and
Accountability Act, which limited overall damages from all
passenger rail claims arising from a single accident to $200
million, including punitive damages and required Amtrak to
carry this level of accident liability insurance.\50\ Congress
amended this provision in the Fixing America's Surface
Transportation Act (FAST Act) by requiring the Secretary of
Transportation to adjust the ceiling based on the change in
Consumer Price Index, with revisions required every five
years.\51\ The Secretary adjusted the rail passenger liability
cap to approximately $295 million in February of 2016.\52\ On
February 25, 2021, the Secretary updated the liability cap to
the current amount of approximately $322.86 million.\53\ The
next increase is expected in February 2026.

While commuter rail agencies are not required by law to
obtain an insurance policy that covers a loss up to that
ceiling, they often are required by host railroads or Positive
Train Control vendor contracts to maintain the statutory
minimum level of liability insurance.\54\ Commuter rail
agencies can experience difficulty with the 30-day window to
acquire coverage following each liability cap increase every
five years.\55\ Dozens of commuter railroads and Amtrak compete
in a narrow market to acquire additional insurance.\56\
Accordingly, commuter rail agencies seek legislative solutions
to make obtaining insurance easier and more affordable, such as
extending the amount of time commuter authorities have to
acquire additional insurance or to create a Federal liability
insurance pool.

GETTING TO WORK: EXAMINING CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS IN THE COMMUTER
RAIL INDUSTRY

----------

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 17, 2024

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous
Materials,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10 a.m. in room
2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Troy E. Nehls
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Nehls. The Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and
Hazardous Materials will come to order.
I ask unanimous consent that the chairman be authorized to
declare a recess at any time during today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that Members not on the
subcommittee be permitted to sit with the subcommittee at
today's hearing and ask questions.
Without objection, so ordered.
And as a reminder, if Members wish to insert a document
into the record, please also email it to

[email protected]

I now recognize myself for the purposes of an opening
statement for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TROY E. NEHLS OF TEXAS, CHAIRMAN,
SUBCOMMITTEE ON RAILROADS, PIPELINES, AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Mr. Nehls. At today's hearing, we will discuss the state of
commuter passenger rail, with a focus on developing commuter
rail to ensure it is safe, efficient, cost effective, and that
it meets the demands of the public.
Investments and innovation in our rail infrastructure are
essential to building a robust and competitive American
transportation system. We must ensure that Federal policies and
spending are balanced with a realistic analysis of consumer
demand for commuter rail and the best use of taxpayer dollars.
Technology has now made it possible to work remotely. Many
workers have responded by purchasing homes farther from the
cities and forgoing their daily work commute. This naturally
affects commuter rail ridership and demand.
Commuter rail service is primarily designed to address a
high volume of passengers traveling to and from cities,
operating in metropolitan, suburban, and exurban areas. These
systems can be a cost-effective transportation alternative for
these longer commutes. Several local and regional agencies
operate their own service, while others contract with Amtrak or
private-sector companies. These private-sector providers help
lower costs, improve services, and increase ridership.
I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses about the
challenges and opportunities for commuter rail services, as
well as best practices to improve service, realize
efficiencies, and increase fare revenues.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. VALERIE P. FOUSHEE OF NORTH CAROLINA,
VICE RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON RAILROADS, PIPELINES, AND
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Mrs. Foushee. Thank you, Chair Nehls, for holding this
hearing today.
The Research Triangle expects to add more than 1 million
people by 2050, and we need to provide good mobility options. I
am hopeful that commuter rail can be a part of that solution.
On the passenger rail front, I do have two State-supported
Amtrak routes in my district, the Carolinian and the Piedmont,
which carried more than 600,000 people last year. The Piedmont
saw a 36-percent increase in ridership after North Carolina and
Amtrak added a fourth daily round trip.
In early December 2023, the U.S. Department of
Transportation announced a $1 billion grant to develop a new
intercity passenger rail route between Raleigh, North Carolina,
and Richmond, Virginia, along the CSX S-Line that will connect
North Carolina with Virginia, Washington, DC, and other
destinations along the Northeast Corridor.
I am proud to see this historic investment, which will
bolster transportation options for North Carolina's residents.
I championed this investment long before arriving to Congress
and appreciate the work my predecessor, former Transportation
Appropriations Subcommittee Chair David Price, did to develop
this intercity passenger rail route.
This generational investment, made possible by the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will make historic changes in my
district. I look forward to working with you, Mr. Chair, and
with our committee to ensure that this type of investment
continues in the future.
Let me now turn to rail safety. I am hopeful that this
committee will focus on this important matter because we have
not yet held a hearing on the Norfolk Southern derailment that
happened in East Palestine, Ohio, or the 1,000 or so other
derailments that occurred across the country last year.
Last month, Secretary Buttigieg sent a letter to the Class
I freight railroad association that expressed concern with the
freight railroads' resistance to improving safety. He
highlighted that the Federal Railroad Administration statistics
do not show safety improving significantly over the past
decade. He encouraged the railroads to join with Congress and
regulators to improve safety, rather than continue to fight
against proposed safety reforms.
I ask consent to put Secretary Buttigieg's letter into the
record.
Mr. Nehls. Without objection.
[This document appears after Representative Foushee's
prepared statement.]
Mrs. Foushee. There are several legislative proposals that
have been introduced in the House that could serve as the basis
for us to address rail safety.
Furthermore, the National Transportation Safety Board, or
NTSB, has 190 outstanding rail safety recommendations from
prior accidents and incidents. The Chair told us this in
January and reiterated it again last week during her
renomination hearing. I hope when the NTSB's final East
Palestine report comes out in June that we will be able to
quickly turn to this issue.
At the same time the safety regulator is expressing
concern, the economic regulator is also raising red flags.
Surface Transportation Board Chair Martin Oberman stated at a
February conference for rail shippers that the freight rail
workforce has declined dramatically over the past decade. While
some railroads have refocused efforts on making capital
investments and rehiring people to make improvements, others
continue to cut workers and cut their capital expenditures.
I ask consent to put STB Chair Oberman's speech into the
record.
Mr. Nehls. Without objection.
[This document appears after Representative Foushee's
prepared statement.]
Mrs. Foushee. Freight rail is essential to our Nation's
economy, but over the last 10 years, freight rail movements
declined. If we want to see the environmental and safety
benefits of moving freight by rail, it seems nearly impossible
to do so if the railroads do not have enough people or are not
making enough investments in their infrastructure.
Turning back to commuter rail, we have been discussing in
my district introducing commuter rail to Durham since the early
1990s, but we don't yet have it.
I look forward to learning more about commuter rail
services around the country from our witnesses, and Mr. Chair,
I yield back.

Letter to Mr. Ian N. Jefferies, President and Chief Executive Officer,
Association of American Railroads, from Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary
of Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation, Submitted for the
Record by Hon. Valerie P. Foushee
The Secretary of Transportation,
Washington, DC 20590.
Mr. Ian N. Jefferies,
President and CEO,
Association of American Railroads.

Dear Mr. Jefferies:
I received your recent letter on railroad safety, which begins with
an observation I agree with: freight rail is an indispensable part of
America's economy and way of life, essential for the delivery of
virtually everything we count on every day. I also agree with your
assertion that safety must be the top consideration whenever we are
discussing railroad policies and practices.
But in reading your letter, I was left with the impression that the
Association of American Railroads (AAR) is satisfied with the current
trajectory of railroad safety in America. I am not.
Your letter correctly notes derailments are today less common than
they were a quarter of a century ago. This is welcome, and it reflects
the skill and effort of people in the railroad industry--as well as the
impact of tougher safety regulations that responded to horrific
disasters. Unfortunately, it is also clear that over the last decade,
the safety performance of the Class I freight companies has stagnated--
and, by some measures, deteriorated. Like the American public, this
Department considers that trend to be unacceptable.
In the spirit of your stated aim of ``continually identifying and
implementing safety advancements,'' I want to emphasize how your
industry could do more to make sure that status quo improves. Let us
begin with some basic data.
[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

The above graph shows derailment rates for the last decade. Rates are
defined as number of derailments per million train miles (on mainline
track) or per million yard switching miles (for rail yards). Source:
Federal Railroad Administration

Again, in the last decade, derailment rates have not significantly
improved, according to FRA data. In the case of yard derailments, data
suggest the rate in 2023 was actually 49 percent higher compared to ten
years ago. I recognize and agree with you that not all derailments are
equal in seriousness, and certainly very few of them rise to the level
of the East Palestine, Ohio, derailment in terms of impact and
severity. Yes, mainline derailments differ from yard derailments. But I
cannot accept your letter's generalization likening yard derailments to
``fender benders,'' especially given that in 2023, two Class I freight
employees on duty lost their lives in rail yard accidents while a
separate incident resulting in an explosion at Bailey Yard in North
Platte forced local residents to evacuate their homes.
To be fair, the deterioration in derailment rates has not been
uniform. We have been encouraged by recent data showing that Norfolk
Southern has experienced a 34 percent reduction in the rate of mainline
derailments in the last year. Less encouraging is the fact that data
for 2023 suggest that Norfolk Southern is alone among the Class I
railroads to achieve significant reductions in the rate of mainline
derailments this past year. And more generally, the overall accident
rate has not improved. The rate of accidents not at grade crossings has
been rising slowly throughout the decade, peaking in 2022.

You are correct to note that freight rail is notably safer than
highway freight transport. But this is less cause to be satisfied with
the status quo in rail than to be disturbed by the status quo on our
highways--something we are actively working to change through our
policies and funding on roadway safety.
A more appropriate benchmark might be passenger safety in
commercial aviation. Consider that America's safest mode of
transportation is one which involves using flammable liquids to propel
passengers through the air at nearly the speed of sound. In a typical
year, the number of U.S. commercial airline passenger enplanements is
in the hundreds of millions--and the number of fatal crashes is
typically zero. This is the result of extremely careful and prudent
regulation and safety culture, as well as a determination to
continuously improve. As shown by our response to the Boeing incident
in January, even a close call can lead to extreme scrutiny,
reassessment of practices, and proposals for regulatory reform.
When it comes to railroads, the U.S. Department of Transportation
(DOT) is acting to improve safety using every tool we currently have.
We have used our authority to issue safety advisories, promulgate
rules, and address rail safety concerns, sometimes over industry
objections. We're making historic infrastructure investments to
modernize and improve America's physical rail network--often in
partnership with Class I railroads. That investment includes the
Railroad Crossing Elimination grant program, which enjoys your support
and which benefits your member railroads and American communities
alike.
In this safety journey, industry behavior is as important as
government action. Your letter mentions measures that railroads have
taken, without being required to do so, such as the use of wayside
defect detectors. I agree that we are all better off because these are
in use. Your members have taken many important actions that have
improved safety. We welcome the agreements between your member
corporations and their labor unions that have extended access to sick
leave to more than 88 percent of Class I union freight railroad
workers. I also recognize the work that you highlighted to increase
access to hazardous material information via the AskRAIL app. This work
is welcome, and you have my commitment that our Department will
recognize any positive step for safety that your industry takes, alone
or in partnership with DOT.
But in too many other areas, we encounter major resistance from
industry. And the truth is that we cannot do this work alone. We need
to focus on results. And, to reiterate, the overall results of the last
ten years in reducing accident rates on America's large freight
railroads are unacceptable.
I want to enlist you in the project of rejecting, not defending,
today's status quo with its stagnant or worsening accident rates. The
rate should be going down--and fast. We need AAR and Congress to join
us in the mission of improving safety and to follow through on the
safety commitments made in the wake of East Palestine. Americans expect
those commitments to become actions, and Americans deserve a freight
rail industry that does not oppose common-sense safety measures. I
worry that this industry still does not grasp how profoundly it must
change.
Here are some particular areas of concern:

The freight rail industry stands in opposition to
important provisions in the bipartisan Railway Safety Act. AAR and the
Class I freight railroads could and should break corporate America's
pattern of professing public support for doing better and then lobbying
against efforts to do so. It would be a welcome, watershed moment if
AAR were to change course and support the passage of the bipartisan
Railway Safety Act introduced by Senators Brown and Vance.

In the wake of the East Palestine derailment, each Class
I freight railroad committed to joining the Confidential Close Call
Reporting System program (C3RS), yet one year later almost none of them
have done so. So far Norfolk Southern is the only Class I freight
railroad to join--and only at a select number of work sites with some
of its workers. We again urge all Class I freight railroads to join
C3RS.

AAR continues to advocate for reducing human track
inspections in favor of automated inspections. It is particularly
exasperating to see AAR sometimes imply that DOT is standing in the way
of newer inspection technologies like automated track inspections
(ATI), when in fact railroads are already free to use these newer
technologies as much as they like--complementing, not replacing, human
inspections. If these technologies are as effective as promised, then
by all means, railroads should deploy them widely, use them to
dramatically reduce accident rates, and then we can discuss the future
of track inspection requirements.

The major freight railroads are widely and increasingly regarded as
being obsessed with quarterly profits and short-term operating margins,
to the exclusion of other vital priorities like safety, long-term
network development, customer service, worker wellbeing, and community
engagement. When your industry objects to safety provisions, this
perception deepens.
This reputation for being much too focused on short-term
profitability is fueled by the fact that the industry is pushing for
these workforce cuts and weaker regulations while it is already
extremely--some would say ridiculously--profitable. Because Class I
railroads tend to operate as regional duopolies or monopolies, they are
not subject to the normal dynamics of supply, demand, and competition
seen in most industries. Looking at your firms' profits, it shows. The
Class I freight carriers recorded another wildly profitable year in
2023, with preliminary figures from the six firms indicating a total of
almost $25.2 billion in profits. Margins for these large players are
often routinely above 20 percent.\1\ No one should begrudge a well-run
business responsibly earning a good profit--but when such profitability
is reported at the same time as the high level of customer, worker, and
community complaints we field with regard to this industry, it is
difficult to explain except through the lens of the industry's
political and market power.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Toward the end of your letter, you take exception to the fact that
your industry is sometimes characterized as ``under-regulated.'' This
comment has made me reflect: when an industry's customers are
displeased, its communities frustrated, its workers upset, its
regulators concerned, and its profits stupendous--what better word is
there? If an industry can become spectacularly profitable while
delivering poor service, stagnant safety outcomes, and a growing roster
of communities that are frustrated because they can't get their calls
returned, it is impossible to escape the sense that we are talking
about a broken industry. And a broken industry almost always reflects a
poor regulatory framework.
I will close by taking AAR at its word that you are ``100%
onboard'' a shared goal of enhancing safety. Your industry has an
opportunity now to make good on this commitment. We will know it is
working when accident rates plummet. Together, let's make that happen.
Sincerely,
Pete Buttigieg.

Martin J. Oberman, Chairman, Surface Transportation Board, Address at
the Southeast Association of Rail Shippers 2024 Spring Meeting,
February 29, 2024, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Valerie P. Foushee
Good afternoon. I'm delighted to be here and equally grateful for
SEARS adding me to the agenda at a very late date.
But because of disturbing current trends facing the management of
the four US Class Is, I thought it my responsibility to address this
important gathering of rail stakeholders--and the public--about
existing and potential threats to the soundness of our all-important
national freight rail network.
As we all know, there's a proxy fight brewing for control of
Norfolk Southern--and it does not bode well for the railroad industry,
the U.S. economy, or the public. After weeks of news reports that
Ancora Holdings, a Cleveland based hedge fund, was plotting to wrest
control of Norfolk Southern's board, last week Ancora made their plans
official and released a broadside attack on NS and its corporate
philosophy of maintaining its workforce at resilient levels and
investing for long term growth.
Ancora wants to oust CEO Alan Shaw for the sole purpose of
reversing that corporate strategy.
This effort by a Wall Street firm--with short-term dollar signs in
its eyes--to strip resources out of a railroad, of course, is not new.
Just last year, another hedge fund, Soroban, launched a successful
effort to depose Union Pacific's CEO--not because he was adding
resources--but because he wasn't cutting fast and deep enough.
Freight railroads are pillars of the nation's economy, moving 1.6
billion tons of freight annually, representing 40% of all long-distance
freight movement. And important to the fight against climate change, as
all of you well know, rail offers a significantly more fuel-efficient
and lower carbon-emitting alternative to trucking.
In the past decade, activist investors--like Ancora and Soroban--
began gaining influence, if not outright control, of some railroads.
They recognized that the seven--now six--Class Is dominating the U.S.
and Canada--are natural monopolies and are the only transportation
option for a high percentage of their customers--and therefore held
great potential for profit seeking.
Ignoring the essential role that railroads play in supporting the
success of their customers, i.e., the manufacturers that drive our GDP,
these investors succeeded in pressuring railroad management to exploit
this monopoly power to achieve short-term profits. The strategy was,
largely, to slash workforces, raise prices, and reduce output--i.e.,
service--which they did--thereby risking long-term viability in pursuit
of massive stock buybacks and dividends.
This strategy not only affects the economic output of US industries
which cannot thrive without robust rail service. It also undermines
safety because rail workers are essential to safe rail operations--for
themselves and for the communities through which railroads must travel,
often transporting hazardous materials. Cutting the workers who perform
inspections, repairs and otherwise are responsible to ensure safety,
increases threats to the public as well as the workers themselves. And
unsafe rail operations, of course, undermine rail service.
Because railroads are so essential to the public well-being;
because they have benefited from massive governmental largess since
their inception 200 years ago, and perhaps most importantly because
they are monopolies--or at best, duopolies--for a major portion of
their customers, the Congress long ago imbued railroads with a common
carrier obligation.
To best comprehend the unique import and mandate of the common
carrier obligation, a pronouncement from the US Supreme Court more than
125 years ago, bears repeating over and over again. Quote:

`` . . . railways are public corporations organized for public
purposes, granted valuable franchises and privileges, . . .
many of them are the donees of large tracts of public lands,
and of gifts of money by municipal corporations . . .''

And this is key: `` . . . they all primarily owe duties to the
public of a higher nature even than that of earning large
dividends for their shareholders. The business which the
railroads do is of a public nature, closely affecting almost
all classes in the community--the farmer, the artisan, the
manufacturer, and the trader.''

[United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Ass'n,
166 U.S. 290, 332-33, 17 S. Ct. 540, 555-56, 41 L. Ed. 1007
(1897).]

In all the time since, and even with the passage of the Staggers
Act, this wise and powerful admonition from the Supreme Court has never
been repealed or weakened.
And I am going to repeat it over and over again until it seeps into
the heads of every railroad shareholder--which includes Ancora and
Soroban.
Indeed, just last week, no less a capitalist than Warren Buffet
reminded his shareholders in his annual letter that ``Rail is essential
to America's economic future,'' and in his words, ``[t]he words `common
carrier' define railroad responsibilities.''
Unfortunately, ignoring their public duties, the largest railroads,
beginning roughly around 2014 and persisting for years thereafter,
lacerated their workforces by approximately 30%, or 45,000 persons. The
euphemism they employed to label their actions was PSR.
Thus, it was no surprise that by early 2022, months after the
economy started to rebound from the pandemic, the railroads were in,
what one Wall Street analyst had astutely called, a ``service crisis.''
After closely monitoring rail activity throughout 2021, and patiently
listening to the Class Is worthless claims that they had the situation
under control, the STB had little choice but to act.
In April 2022, the Board intervened and instituted a two-day public
hearing to address the causes of this crisis. At that hearing, the
Board heard from numerous rail shippers who testified about missed
shipments and delayed service that was costing them business. Several
representatives of rail labor detailed the negative impact that the
reduced workforce was having on rail operations and safety. We also
commanded the appearance of senior executives from all the Class Is.
Every stakeholder, including most importantly the rail executives
themselves--told the Board that the cause of the service meltdown was
the simple fact that the Class Is lacked sufficient workers to move the
trains needed to service their customers. The problem was mostly a lack
of engineers and conductors. But carmen, mechanics, and electricians--
the folks who keep the trains in shape to actually move freight and
move it safely--had also been cut, slowing down rail operations.
Shippers also reported difficulties at the white-collar level, with
inabilities to reach salespeople and customer representatives.
Of course, the rail executives were slow to acknowledge the
obvious--that the shortages were the inexorable consequence of their
own choices to eliminate tens of thousands of rail workers in recent
years.
Not ever having run a railroad--or having been a manager of any
large business myself--I have thought long and hard about how the
industry could ever have allowed itself to achieve such a dismal
failure of its own business operations. No person who knows anything
about running a railroad--and these executives do know how to run a
railroad--could have failed to foresee that eventually the firing of
45,000 workers would catch up to them.
The explanation of course is that pressure from short term
investors focused only on the operating ratio--or as my friend Tony
Hatch likes to call it--the cult of the OR. Somehow, Wall Street has
decided that the only important measure of success in the rail world is
to have an OR at 60 or below. When the analysts can report progress
towards that goal, rail stock prices have soared. These low ORs--which
could only be achieved rapidly--as the activists demanded--by cutting
payroll--have meant lots of free cash which the Class Is have not been
shy about paying out in stock buybacks, dividends, and in BNSF's case,
returns to its owner. The total in the last decade or so is over
$250,000,000--money which was not invested in retaining workers or
building new infrastructure to increase a railroad's reach and serve
more customers.
It is no mystery that this service crisis depressed the nation's
industrial output. It also was a contributor to port congestion,
causing shortages of consumer goods and increased prices.
As a result of the eye-opening revelations at the hearing, the
Board promptly ordered the four US Class Is--the railroads with the
most significant service failures--to file with the Board service
recovery plans with intermediate goals over the following six and 12
months for their service improvements. The Board also mandated regular
reporting of the railroads' efforts to rebuild their workforces to
achieve those service goals. This included reports of hiring, training,
washouts, and furloughs.
After that April 2022 hearing, some progress has been made
generally throughout the industry. Up until recently, hiring and
training had been reinstituted at higher levels which resulted in a
slow beginning of service improvement.
But one standout failure of progress was at UP. During 2022, UP--
alone among the railroads--was subject to two emergency service
orders--the first issued by the STB in over 10 years. UP also
instituted a massive upsurge of 1,100 embargoes annually--labelling
them congestion embargoes--a legal animal which in my opinion, does not
exist, except possibly when the congestion is entirely the fault of the
rail customer.
In December 2022, the STB held an additional public hearing to
investigate these embargoes. At the hearing, UP conceded that its
colossal use of ``congestion embargoes'' was largely caused by crew
shortages resulting from the fact that in previous years, UP had cut
its overall work force by over 25%. At that hearing, when he was
pressed on whether UP would commit itself to maintaining the resources
to start providing adequate rail service, UP's Lance Fritz told the
STB: ``We learned our lesson once; we don't have to learn it again.''
And shortly thereafter, he was shown the door--replaced by a management
strategy which we now know has profoundly rejected and unlearned the
lessons of too much cutting.
By contrast, in recent years, other Class Is had appeared to learn
the error of their ways and brought in new management committed to
reversing these myopic and short-term strategies.
Some say it has been the Board's actions which have had a positive
effect. But whatever the reason, Boards of Directors in the past two
years have supported CEOs at Canadian National, CSX, CPKC, and very
importantly, Norfolk Southern, to make a new and different commitment.
Recognizing their public obligations, they have instituted long-term
strategies to reinvest capital and, most importantly through the ups
and downs of economic cycles, to hire and retain workers to provide
consistent and reliable service.
This should be an important message to Wall Street investors
because this strategy has every likelihood of producing more
sustainable and long-term gains for shareholders as compared to the
short-term thinking which dominated the advent of the PSR craze.
The problem with activist investors bowing down to the cult of the
OR is that they are impatient and want immediate returns. Their
approach to lowering OR as fast as possible can only be accomplished by
drastically cutting payroll and other resources in the short term.
It does not take a degree in higher mathematics to understand that
there is another way to lower the OR than by reducing the numerator,
i.e., which includes the amount spent on payroll.
The OR will also go down if you increase the denominator--that is
by having enough resources to attract new business to the railroad,
increase the volume--the number of loads--and thereby increase total
revenue. That is the vision being employed up to now by this new group
of CEOs--particularly those at CSX, CN and yes, Norfolk Southern.
Thus far, those CEOs and their Boards have resisted pressure from
activist investors to eviscerate workforces and cut spending on
expansion capital. They understand that planning and spending for the
long run--while taking time--will ultimately benefit shareholders more
than short-term cost cutting, which is detrimental to the long-term
vitality of the railroads and undermines efforts to improve safety. And
of course, a long-term, future-focused strategy is essential if the
railroads are to support the nation's economy and the public interest.
Since the April 2022 hearing, the railroads have hired and trained
approximately 9,000 workers. While that still leaves the railroads with
14,000 fewer workers than pre-pandemic, even this limited increase has
resulted in improved rail service. Moreover, the economy is expected to
grow in the coming months and years. If the railroads are to meet their
obligation to serve this expected growth, they must continue their
expansion of both railroad workforces and infrastructure. Norfolk
Southern has promised to do this and has already begun to deliver.
Any campaign, proxy or otherwise, that threatens to undo recent
efforts to rebuild the railroad resilience and move toward significant
long-term growth would be a major setback. It would undercut safety and
be the opposite of good business, the opposite of fulfilling the common
carrier obligation, and the opposite of meeting the Congressional
commandment to serve the public. Regardless of what happens with
Norfolk Southern's governance, it is crucial that management take
seriously their duties to customers and the public.
To envision the consequences to NS if Ancora's efforts result in a
course reversal, we need only look at what has happened at UP since
just last August when its new CEO arrived with Soroban's short term, OR
lowering mandate.
In contrast to other Class Is, UP has embarked on a furlough
odyssey. From the time Jim Vena arrived in August 2023, through January
2024, as shown in UP's reports to the STB, UP has reduced its operating
personnel by 771--this, after cutting 25% of its workforce in previous
years. Every other US Class I has increased employment during the same
period.
At UP's 4th quarter earnings call, Mr. Vena promised growth, but at
the same time promised to continue to reduce headcount throughout 2024
as he has done continuously since he arrived. Indeed, just last week,
UP announced additional furloughs. And the railroads' year end filings
show that UP is the only Class I which ended 2023 with hundreds of
fewer workers than it had a year earlier. All of the others, including
Norfolk Southern, the only railroad which reported zero furloughs,
ended the year with a larger workforce.
Just today, the STB received a letter the FRA has sent to UP
raising the specter of a threat to safety resulting from UP's
eliminating hundreds of maintenance of equipment employees.
Equally important, UP, unlike the others, is also cutting its
capital spending, just when it's most needed for growth. UP's 2023
financial statements show that at the end of last year when it
furloughed hundreds of maintenance of way workers, it also cut $100
million out of its 2023 capital budget.
Thus, at the end of 2023, UP had $100 million in deferred capital
maintenance, the effects of which may not be seen tomorrow, but which
will eventually haunt the railroad, as we have seen in the past.
UP also promises to continue on this path in 2024. Rather than make
up for the $100 million cut in 2023, UP has actually reduced its 2024
capital budget by $300 million, planning to spend only $3.4 billion as
compared to its 2023 capital budget of $3.7 billion. By contrast,
BNSF's capital budget for 2024 is $3.9 billion. And BNSF has already
spent hundreds of millions more on projects like double tracking its
Southern Transcon and building a massive new intermodal facility at
Barstow.
I must add, however, that BNSF only recently has decided to hop on
the furlough bandwagon again--announcing hundreds of new furloughs just
last week, with more to come. This is, indeed, unfortunate. How does
BNSF's return to furloughing square with its exciting new partnership
with J.B. Hunt to move millions of truckloads to rail by delivering 95%
on time performance?
And does UP really expect us to believe that it is committed to
growth when it is cutting personnel and capital--the very resources
which are essential to that growth.
There's a saying of something about a turnip truck in here.
While UP's course since the advent of the Soroban era is
instructive about what happens to a railroad whose strategy is set by
an activist investor rather than by a Board and CEO committed to the
best interest of the railroad, we can get a further taste of what can
be expected to happen at NS if Ancora takes over by looking at how NS
has already responded to Ancora's planned proxy fight thus far. Under
obvious pressure from Ancora's threats, NS recently announced buy outs
for 7% of its management and staff--in direct contrast to its previous
strategy of holding on to workers. And while management doesn't drive
trains, it is essential to a well-functioning railroad that serves its
present and potential customers.
And in the all-important area of future growth for railroads by
landing the burgeoning increase in intermodal traffic, one of Ancora's
strongest criticisms is that NS has too much intermodal traffic
compared to merchandise traffic. Ancora's complaint is that intermodal
is not as profitable. Apparently, Ancora, inexperienced in railroading
as it is, is unaware that roughly half of all rail traffic in the US is
intermodal and that intermodal is where future volume growth is. Coal
is not coming back.
So what has happened at NS since those threats were levied? NS,
which has been a standout in growing its intermodal base, has only
recently announced that it is terminating some of its lower density
intermodal lanes, regardless of whether there might be growth potential
for the future.
Several weeks ago, Ancora wrote me a letter. The essence of their
message was that they had taken a $1 billion dollar stake in NS in
order for it--quote--``to become a safer railroad.'' Really? What hedge
fund raises $1 billion to promote safety anywhere? The measure of
Ancora's disingenuous pitch to improve safety is that its slide deck
completely omits reference to FRA data which shows that, in the last
year, NS has been an industry leader in reducing mainline rail
accidents and derailments. And NS is the only Class I railroad which
has joined the Department of Transportation Confidential Close Call
Reporting System, a major advance in instituting a safe culture in any
workplace.
Ancora has nothing to say about what it could do better.
I think we can assume that if Ancora succeeds in its bid to control
NS, its next move will be to put the Brooklyn Bridge on the market.
Let's be real. Looking at Ancora's slide deck issued last week in
which they're required to be a little more candid when soliciting other
shareholders, Ancora principally and repeatedly focuses on a rapid
lowering of the OR to drive cash payouts and raise its stock price,
harshly criticizing present NS management for not making a lower OR the
objective.
We now know that this is wrong headed thinking. Making OR the
corporate objective is what led to elimination of thousands of workers
which caused the service crisis.
Joe Hinrichs emphasized this morning that using OR as an operating
objective by itself will ultimately lead to bad results. And another
CEO has put it so well: ``the operating ratio has always been an
outcome of running the railway the right way.'' You ``don't cut your
way to success.'' That same CEO pointed out to his investors: ``I'm not
enamored with having the lowest operating ratio. I'm enamored with
earnings growth.'' In other words, managing a railroad for growth will
achieve more sustainable profitability.
In fact, the rapid reduction in OR championed by Ancora can only be
accomplished by new major reductions in the workforce. Indeed, Ancora
rejects NS' new long-term growth strategy and is particularly harsh on
NS' focus on all important intermodal traffic. Clearly, their plan is
to install a CEO ordered to reverse Norfolk Southern's recently
instituted corporate strategy to maintain a resilient workforce and to
invest more in infrastructure to grow the railroad's capacity long
term.
The implications of significant cost-cutting at one railroad are
ominous for the US economy. The fall out could extend to the entire
freight rail system. Railroads crisscross North America in an
intertwined network; freight is often handed from one railroad to
another before reaching its destination. When one railroad has a
service meltdown, it has a ripple effect across all other railroads.
Such a debacle occurred in 2017 when CSX went on a cost-cutting
rampage--a shock to the system from which it took years to recover.
Already, industrial customers of Norfolk Southern and shortline
railroads that feed into Norfolk Southern have raised serious concerns
that significant cost-cutting would undo the progress of the last two
years.
And of significance, two rail unions whose members' quality of life
has improved under current NS management and whose personal safety is
at stake have announced their strong opposition to Ancora's proposed
management strategy which relies on the cult of the OR.
Contrary to Ancora's sales pitch, a reversion to cutting workforces
by major railroads would actually impede efforts to improve service and
to improve safety standards to minimize the chances of another disaster
like last year's East Palestine, Ohio derailment. These very concerns
about what could happen to Norfolk Southern were raised recently by FRA
administrator Amit Bose.
Of equal if not greater concern to the health of the entire freight
rail industry is that a successful takeover by any investors overly
focused on cost cutting will have the other railroad CEOs looking over
their shoulders, deterring them from pursuing long-term strategies, and
harming the U.S. economy.
At least for the last three years since I've been chairman, the STB
has engaged in a long, continuous and continuing struggle to counteract
the effects of this Wall Street pressure.
It's a never-ending tension. Wall Street will always be there--
which is fine, it's part of our capitalist structure. But the activist
investors, such as the ones that have surfaced now at Norfolk Southern,
have a very short-term goal and it's not constructive.
Indeed, if Ancora is successful, we will have a national rail
network, in which half of it--UP and NS--will be run by CEOs answering
to short term, cash maximizing, shareholders to the detriment of the
long-term investors--and most dangerously to the detriment of rail
customers and rail workers--and ultimately the US economy and every
member of the public.
Under those circumstances, I do not expect the STB will sit by and
watch and wait while another service crisis unfolds as we confronted in
2022.
On the contrary, if service suffers, ultimately the STB would be
called in--and may have little alternative but to institute more
accountability hearings and more regulatory intervention to protect the
public, an outcome which neither railroad investors nor the STB would
relish.
To be clear, the STB has tools available to incentivize better
service. We are already considering a rule to make reciprocal switching
a practical tool to provide relief to shippers experiencing subpar
service. And the Board has also stated it is interested in considering
additional ways to grant sole-served shippers competitive access to a
second railroad. In my view, for example, it may well be time for the
STB to re-examine the restrictions contained in the decades old
bottleneck rule.
To be clear: Railroads are a regulated monopoly. They have a common
carrier obligation to the public interest and to the nation's economy.
Unlike other businesses, railroad management and owners are not just
free to manipulate the business by draining the company's resources for
short-term gain.
Those of us in the rail community--and every U.S. citizen--need to
stay tuned. To be continued.
Thank you.

Mr. Nehls. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize the
ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Larsen, for 5 minutes
for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair, and thank you,
Vice Ranking Member Foushee, for holding today's hearing on
commuter rail.
The BIL supercharged our Nation's investment in passenger
rail, providing $102 billion in planned funding for intercity
rail and $108 billion for transit agencies. A significant
portion of this can be used for commuter rail.
Now, the BIL guaranteed multiyear funding for the state-of-
good-repair investments and corridor development for intercity
and commuter passenger rail. It made possible, for the first
time ever, dedicated, reliable Federal funding disbursed over 5
years to improve and expand intercity passenger rail.
Now, transit agencies, Amtrak, the FRA, and the FTA are
implementing long-term plans for passenger rail expansion and
improvement, secure in the knowledge that the funding is there
for the next 5 years. I look forward to hearing from our
witnesses today about the difference this budget certainty has
made for developing and sustaining infrastructure improvements
and then, of course, what Congress can do to keep the momentum.
Commuter rail systems have benefited from BIL funds,
including the Capital Investment Grant, or CIG, funding, which
supports transit expansion. In my district, Sound Transit runs
Sounder trains with two round trips every weekday between
Everett, Mukilteo, Edmonds, and Seattle. Further south, the
Sounder serves commuters between Tacoma and Seattle. The trains
run on freight tracks owned by BNSF, and BNSF operates the
trains. Amtrak provides maintenance and Sound Transit owns the
stations and provides security. This partnership is an example
of the layers of support and coordination often necessary to
provide commuter train service in the U.S.
And even at the Federal level there are silos, though, with
the Federal Railroad Administration providing most of the
regulatory oversight of commuter rail and the Federal Transit
Administration providing the bulk of the funding. So, I look
forward to hearing recommendations from the witnesses for the
next infrastructure bill to make passenger rail funding and
service more effective.
Now, BIL passenger rail funding is creating jobs, it is
growing regional economies, it is reducing congestion and
carbon emissions, it is building a cleaner, a greener, a safer,
and more accessible transportation network. For example, the
FTA announced over $631 million to replace 302 aging transit
railcars, including over $100 million for Metra in Chicago.
That is just the beginning. This transformational investment in
the BIL is a great start. I am committed to ensuring reliable
funding for long in the future.
The BIL is also an investment in workers. Federal rail
funding will develop a well-trained and diverse workforce to
build, operate, and maintain intercity and commuter rail
systems. So, while commuter rail agencies have access to
dedicated funding through transit programs, there is no similar
guaranteed source of funding for intercity passenger rail. And
without the BIL's advance appropriations, intercity passenger
rail is dependent on the annual appropriations process to fund
its longer term major capital projects.
Since commuter rail often shares tracks with freight or
intercity passenger rail, investments in rail benefit those
other partners. The FRA's Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and
Safety Improvements grants, or CRISI, can be used to upgrade
commuter rail property that is shared with Amtrak or freight
rail, and the BIL guaranteed $5 billion in advance
appropriations for CRISI. Providing steady funding for
intercity passenger rail will allow States and communities the
certainty they need to plan and deliver more and better
passenger rail service.
So, I thank the witnesses for being here today, for sharing
your perspectives on these and other issues, and helping us
hear about the opportunities and challenges facing you all in
today's environment.
With that, I yield back.

I again thank you all for being here. I look forward to hearing
from each and every one of you.
I would like to take a moment to explain our lighting

Green means go. Obviously, yellow, slow it down a little bit,
you are running out of time, and then red means stop talking.
I ask unanimous consent that the witnesses' full statements
be included into the record.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record of today's
hearing remain open until such time as our witnesses have
provided answers to any questions that may be submitted to them
in writing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 days for any additional comments and information
submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in the record
of today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
As your written testimony has been made part of this
record, the subcommittee asks that you limit your oral remarks
to those 5 minutes.
And now I would like to briefly recognize Mr. Yakym to
introduce our first witness, Mr. Noland.
Mr. Yakym.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is my pleasure to
introduce Mike Noland, the president of the Northern Indiana
Commuter Transportation District which, back home in Indiana,
we call the South Shore Line.
The South Shore provides a vital connection between South
Bend, Indiana--in my district--and Chicago, and many points in
between, including the Indiana Dunes National Park. I and many
other Hoosiers have fond memories of taking the South Shore to
Chicago. I am sure many people from Chicago have fond memories
of coming to South Bend to catch maybe a Notre Dame football
game.
Mike has over three decades in the rail industry, and he
has presided over major capital projects for the South Shore
Line. I especially want to highlight the almost complete $650
million double track project, which will further cut down the
time from South Bend to Chicago by making the full route
double-tracked so that eastbound trains don't have to wait for
westbound trains, and vice versa.
Mike and I go way back, and I am thankful that you invited
him today to lend his deep experience and expertise to our
conversation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. With that wonderful introduction, I would like
to now recognize you, Mr. Noland, for 5 minutes.

REGIONAL RAIL AUTHORITY (METROLINK)

TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL NOLAND, PRESIDENT, NORTHERN INDIANA
COMMUTER TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT, AND CHAIRMAN, COMMUTER RAIL
COALITION

Mr. Noland. On behalf of the members of the Commuter Rail
Coalition, thank you, Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Larsen,
and Congresswoman Foushee for inviting us here today to testify
on some very unique issues, challenges, and opportunities
facing commuter rail across the country.
I would like to also thank Congressman Yakym for his
vigorous support of the South Shore Line and, of course, our
wonderful Governor, Eric Holcomb, who has been an incredible
cheerleader and champion for commuter rail in the State of
Indiana, investing hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars
into our rail system.
As mentioned, my name is Mike Noland. Today, I am here as
chairman of the Commuter Rail Coalition, an industry coalition
representing the public agencies that provide 98 percent of all
ridership in the country, plus over 30 private-sector
consultants and suppliers that support our industry. I am also
president of the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation
District that operates the South Shore Line. And as Congressman
Yakym mentioned, we are a 90-mile system that runs from South
Bend, Indiana, to Chicago, Illinois.
I will focus my testimony today on two specific areas:
first is the lack of capacity in the excess liability insurance
market; and second is the Amtrak statutory authority over
public-sector commuter rail operations.
Commuter railroads purchase annually $323 million in excess
liability insurance. That is the Federal cap. The cap will be
adjusted in 2026, and it is based upon the Consumer Price
Index. That is the sole determinant of the cap raise. We expect
that the cap will go up from $323 million to over $400 million
when the CPI is used.
To be clear, commuter railroads are not required to
purchase up to the cap. We do so because we have to comply with
our third-party contracts. If a commuter railroad is unable to
place that coverage, contractors, software providers, host
railroads like Class I's can put us in breach of contract, and
the likelihood is that some of us will have to suspend
operations.
The Commuter Rail Coalition is asking for Congress to give
us a technical correction to the 30-day implementation rule
that is currently in law when the cap is raised. We would like
365 days of time to place the additional coverage. Why 365
days? Well, if all of us, all 32 railroads in the country, at
the same time approach the excess insurance markets, we think
it is very unlikely that we will be successful. We have to go
after these markets with a time when there is shrinking
capacity in these markets. And if we are all there with 30 days
to try to place that coverage, we don't think that is a recipe
for success.
We know that we must search for alternatives to our
reliance on foreign insurance markets. We ask Congress to work
with us to explore options and do studies.
We also are looking for help from Congress perhaps to
support some loans so that we could establish a national
commuter rail industry liability pool. We are looking for ways
to exercise self-help to resolve this issue.
My final point has to do with Amtrak's relationship with
commuter agencies, and the need for the Surface Transportation
Board to serve as the arbiter of any disputes between commuter
railroads and Amtrak. The Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970
provided railroads the opportunity to be relieved of costly
passenger operations, and Amtrak took those over. In return,
the railroads granted priority access to Amtrak over their
routes, and only charge Amtrak incremental costs. Importantly,
public commuter rail agencies were not part of that grand
bargain. However, Amtrak's statutory powers under the RPSA
apply to our systems.
Now, the CRC is a strong supporter of improved and expanded
passenger rail networks in this country. We are not in any way
anti-Amtrak. However, we believe that commuter railroads should
not be subject to Amtrak's statutory powers under the RPSA of
priority access on our lines or from only charging incremental
costs if they are using our service. We would ask Congress to
establish a well-defined process to issue resolution between
commuter railroads and Amtrak. We believe the STB is the right
body to adjudicate such disputes, and we hope that Congress in
the reauthorization will provide the STB that power.
Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Larsen, Congresswoman
Foushee, thank you on behalf of the Commuter Rail Coalition for
having this hearing today. We appreciate the opportunity to
realize the full potential commuter rail has to be stewards of
the public interest.
And since I have the opportunity, I invite any and all of
you to come out on May 13 to our ribbon-cutting ceremony that
will be held in Gary at our Miller Station. And if you can't
make it for that, come out any time. We will give you a ride on
the South Shore Line, which is the Nation's last remaining
interurban passenger railroad.
Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Michael Noland, President, Northern Indiana
Commuter Transportation District, and Chairman, Commuter Rail Coalition
Introduction
On behalf of the members of the Commuter Rail Coalition, I want to
thank you Chairman Nehls and Ranking Member Payne for the opportunity
to testify on some very unique issues, challenges and opportunities
facing the commuter rail agencies across the nation.
I also wish to report that the very significant funding increase we
have seen since the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has
provided necessary funds for critical investment and the predictability
that allows us to move towards, or to maintain, a state of good repair.
I am Mike Noland, Chairman of the Commuter Rail Coalition (CRC) and
President of the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District,
operator of the South Shore Line commuter rail system. Along with my
colleagues Debra Johnson, CEO of Denver RTD, fellow Coalition board
member David Dech, Executive Director of the South Florida Regional
Transportation Authority, CRC board member Darren Kettle, CEO of LA
Metrolink, and one of my CRC co-founders, New Jersey Transit's Kevin
Corbett, we wish to review the state of commuter rail operations our
industry faces today. From changing travel patterns and demographics
altering how our customers use our service, and how we deliver that
service, to changes taking place in the worldwide excess insurance
industry that directly impacts our ability to deliver service, we are
definitely in a state of change.
As President of the South Shore Line I oversee a 90-mile commuter
railroad serving Northern Indiana with service into downtown Chicago.
Today, I am here as Chairman of the CRC, an industry coalition
representing the public agencies that provide over 98 percent of all
commuter rail ridership and over 30 private sector suppliers and
consultants that support our industry.
The Coalition just celebrated its five-year anniversary and we are
very proud of our collective efforts to communicate with one voice to
critical stakeholders such as the U.S. Congress and the Department of
Transportation, about trends in service and the needs of our industry
going forward. Since day one our mission has been to engage and educate
stakeholders on the tremendous value commuter railroads bring to the
communities we serve.
Safe, Efficient, Climate Friendly
Commuter rail is not only safe, it is reliable, efficient, and
climate friendly, proving to be an excellent return on the investment
of public dollars. The 32 commuter rail agencies across the country
pride themselves in providing 314 million (2022) riders with the safest
mode of ground transportation.
How safe? According to the National Safety Council, commuter rail
is the safest mode of ground transportation in the U.S. And with
innovations in technology such as Positive Train Control (PTC) and
human factors analysis, commuter railroads are continuously improving
their safety performance.
The much-discussed PTC is just one of the many safety systems
already in use by commuter railroads. My colleague Mr. Kettle just
received a grant to introduce an intrusion detection system that will
further enhance the capabilities of PTC in Southern California, and Mr.
Corbett's New Jersey Transit will soon begin using AI to improve grade
crossing safety on their light rail lines--a technology that will have
application for commuter rail as well. The technology that railroads
are installing today will be undergoing improvements and updates for
decades to come.
Commuter rail performs better than almost every other mode in
operating expenses per passenger mile traveled. According to the
National Transit Database, only subways provide better cost
effectiveness.
And of the top 20 US metro areas ranked by GDP, only three job
centers are not served by commuter railroads. In the Chicago
Metropolitan area alone, regional transit, of which commuter rail is an
integral part, directly supports 126,000 jobs. Regional economic
activity created by transit is approximately $5.6 billion per year
while additional tax revenue created by transit is approximately $1
billion per year. In the Chicago region, the economic benefit returned
per $1.00 invested in transit is $3.86 \1\.

The transportation sector as a whole--including private cars,
commercial trucks, commercial and private planes--is responsible for
nine percent of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions--the largest of all
US sectors. According to the Federal Railroad Administration, however,
the rail sector--freight and passenger combined--emits only two percent
of GHG, while also reducing dependence on private cars and commercial
trucking.
Rail's efficiency plays an important role in reducing the transport
sector's emissions. Without transit, an additional 1.7 billion miles
would be driven in the Chicago region, creating an additional 375,000
tons of greenhouse gas emissions and 1,500 additional severe traffic
accidents \2\.

As mentioned, I am the President of the South Shore Line commuter
railroad, a 90-mile system serving Northwest Indiana, from South Bend
International Airport to Millennium Station in Chicago. I have
dedicated my career to providing safe and efficient rail service to
millions of riders, and in Indiana we are thrilled that the South Shore
service is being improved and expanded through a partnership with the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) with two Full Funding Grant
Agreements as part of the Capital Investment Grant program. The
combined impact of the new West Lake service, which will open in 2025,
and the Double Track service, which will be open by this time next
month, is nothing short of transformational for Northwest Indiana. The
State of Indiana anticipates that these projects will generate in
excess of $2.5 billion in private sector development over the next 20
years, and a conservative return of $2 for every state dollar invested
(with a more likely $4 in return) from these rail projects. In fact, we
are already seeing over $500 million of committed private sector
investment through transit development next to our stations, before
opening service on either project.
If the Chairman would indulge me for just a moment, I would like to
thank Representative Yakym, a member of this subcommittee, for his
support of this investment and for his keen interest in South Shore
Line Service.
``Commuter rail'' is traditionally defined as a passenger rail
service that primarily operates within a metropolitan area, connecting
commuters to a central city from adjacent suburbs or towns. Commuter
rail systems are ``heavy rail'' using electric or diesel trains, as
opposed to traditional subways or elevated ``light rail'' trains.
As my colleague Debra Johnson will address in greater detail,
commuter rail as a mode has generated frequent jurisdictional questions
within the federal government. Depending on the issue, we fall
alternately under the jurisdiction of either the Federal Transit
Administration or Federal Railroad Administration. We receive much of
our federal assistance through formula funds, and we access to the
Capital Investment Grant Program of the Federal Transit Administration
for our large extension projects. The Federal Railroad Administration
has safety oversight of all our operations and recently has also
awarded some discretionary funding grants for commuter rail agencies.
The service we provide, as well as the make-up of our agencies,
reflects the diverse communities we serve.
Ours is an industry with both a long history and significant recent
growth: 12 new commuter rail services debuted in just the past 20
years. The oldest in the nation, the Long Island Rail Road, is this
year marking its 190th anniversary. The South Shore Line service began
over a century ago, and the Denver RTD launched commuter rail service
in 2016.
Some of our agencies--like my own, Mr. Kettle's Metrolink, and Mr.
Dech's Tri-Rail--are stand-alone commuter rail only service providers;
others are part of multi-modal operations. Debra Johnson and Kevin
Corbett both lead multi-modal agencies that provide a mix of rail and
bus transit services.
At the South Shore Line, we are the direct providers of the
service. On the Metra system in Chicago, where I previously served as
Chief Counsel for 16 years, the agency contracts with the Union Pacific
and Burlington Northern Sante Fe to provide some of its service, and it
directly operates five other service corridors in their system. In
Florida, Dave Dech's system contracts out to provide service through
Herzog, and in Los Angeles, Darren Kettle's Metrolink system is
operated by Amtrak.
Issues Facing Commuter Rail Today
My colleagues will delve into this more fully in their remarks, but
myriad external factors illustrate that commuter rail has an
opportunity to embrace an era of renaissance.
There is no better time for the CRC to have brought these voices
together in support of the agencies and, collectively, the mode in
addressing the need to:

Adapt to the post-pandemic ridership habits.

Responding to freight operating practices and safety
issues that impact communities through which we travel

Balancing our needs with those of Amtrak's and other
intercity passenger rail initiatives and ensuring that commuter
railroads have equal footing in these discussions.

With respect to our interactions with Amtrak, it would be very
beneficial for the commuter rail industry to have one oversight agency
or administrative body with jurisdiction over issues impacting our
systems to evaluate the sometimes competing priorities and balance
everyone's needs.
Over the course of our long history, commuter railroads have met
many challenges.
I am happy to report that our industry succeeded with one of the
biggest yet--the installation of PTC across all of our systems. The
cost of implementation, with over 90 percent funded with precious local
resources from our capital development budgets, came to roughly $4
Billion for public agencies. And agencies are spending millions of
dollars in ongoing, annual maintenance and upgrades to keep PTC in top
form.
The logistical challenges to implement PTC were equally harrowing.
One of the main hurdles was ``interoperability'': The requirement that
any train operating over another railroad's tracks must be able to
communicate seamlessly with the ``back office'' of that railroad's PTC
system, in addition to its own system. Nowhere was that more difficult
than in Chicago, with its dense rail network that sees 1,300 to 1,400
commuter and freight trains each day. Metra Chicago's PTC system must
work seamlessly with the PTC systems of 12 other railroad companies
including my South Shore Line--and on one of Metra's lines, the
Southwest Service, it has to work with five.
Challenge of Procuring Liability Insurance
Currently we face a challenge to our ability to operate that is
beyond our control, has nothing to do with our operations, and in our
opinion, completely ignores the incredible safety record and commuter
railroads' further safety enhancements, such as PTC. I am speaking
about the challenge we face securing excess commercial liability
insurance up to the federal liability cap. This problem threatens our
ability to operate and will require close collaboration between the
commuter rail industry and Congress. You are likely somewhat familiar
with a similar scenario. The mainstream press has covered the fate of
homeowners with no claims history losing their insurance as carriers
exit various markets ``due to declining profitability.'' (Newsweek,
March 4, 2024)
In September 2023, the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing on
Perspectives on Challenges in the Property Insurance Market and the
Impact on Consumers. The climate the Senate Banking Committee examined
for consumers is similar for commuter railroads. In a ``hardened''
insurance market, insurers are limiting their exposure by reducing
coverage, or pulling out of markets entirely because they have made
profitability calculations based on the range of payouts made to a
broad range of insureds, such as following extreme weather events
(hurricanes, tornados), wild-fires, coastal flooding, Texas grid
failure, and mass-casualty events.
The issues we face in worldwide excess insurance market are
serious. Commuter railroads currently carry $323 million in excess
liability coverage, the federal cap. Under law, the federal cap will be
CPI-adjusted by notice in early 2026, at which time commuter railroads
will have only 30 days to secure the additional coverage. If we are
unable to place this additional coverage, contractors and host
railroads can declare breach of contract, requiring a railroad to stop
running service.
Compounding this issue is the fact that we can only purchase small
amounts of our excess insurance from US insurers; today the maximum we
can purchase from domestic insurance carriers is only $32.5 million per
railroad. Commuter railroads are forced to spend public dollars to
purchase the balance, $300 million in additional coverage, in overseas
insurance markets.
The Coalition's immediate focus, though, involves the need for a
technical correction to modify the 30-day timeframe mandated in law
that provides for an adjustment to the federal cap on passenger and
commuter rail liability. I fear that if this provision is not adjusted
from 30 to 365 days before the next adjustment--currently scheduled for
the first quarter of 2026--we may have to shut down and suspend some or
all of our commuter rail systems.
A bit of background: Limitations (or caps) on rail passenger
liability first appeared in December 1997, as part of Title 49 U.S.C.
Section 28103, when it was set at $200 million. Eight years later, in
December 2015, the cap was incorporated into Section 11415 of the
Fixing America's Surface Transportation (``FAST Act'') and was
increased to $294 million. The FAST Act also indexed the cap to
inflation, to be adjusted every five years.
The largest commuter rail settlement to date occurred in 2010 as a
result of the Chatsworth, California incident in which 25 people were
killed and 135 injured. At that time the liability cap was $200M.
Following that event, Congress mandated the implementation of
positive train control and the improved crashworthiness of passenger
rail vehicles and set the wheels in motion to periodically adjust the
liability cap as indexed by the Consumer Prices Index. No commuter rail
incident of the magnitude seen in Chatsworth has occurred since.
The index methodology ensures that the aggregate allowable awards
to all rail passengers, against all defendants, for all claims,
including punitive damages, arising from a single accident or incident
in the commuter rail or passenger rail industry is based on current
dollars adjusted for inflation.
The cap was last adjusted in February 2021, when the five-year look
back added roughly $26 million to the new liability limits. The
Department of Transportation triggered that increase by issuing a
notice that the statutory adjustment to the rail passenger
transportation liability cap under Section 11415 of the FAST Act would
go into effect 30 days after the day the Secretary's notice was
published in the Federal Register.
The liability cap of $323 million became effective on March 27,
2021. Every commuter railroad in the country raced to acquire the
additional $26 million in coverage in the excess liability market. Many
did not secure this additional coverage until nearly the end of this
30-day timeframe.
The cap is next scheduled to be adjusted in the first quarter of
2026. With the Consumer Price Index as the sole determinant of the
adjustment, the Commuter Rail Coalition anticipates a significant
increase up to and likely in excess of an additional $70 million
dollars.
Due to the state of the domestic insurance market, all commuter
rail agencies and Amtrak must procure a large proportion of their
coverage from overseas insurers. U.S. insurers have, over time, exited
the market for ``excess liability'' coverage, reasoning that they could
deploy their capital in other areas and absorb less risk. The reasons
domestic insurance companies exited the market are varied, but the fact
remains that as public agencies we have no choice but to find this
insurance coverage in foreign markets. Our need to purchase insurance
outside the United States is certainly contrary to the Buy America
initiatives so important to Congress.
Further, no single insurance company is willing to fully insure an
agency for a potentially catastrophic event. Consequently, multiple
excess insurance carriers participate to provide converge up the
federal cap, building layers of insurance from just above our self-
insured retention levels up the top layer of coverage. These layers are
referred to as insurance ``towers'' and are built from the bottom
(highest risk coupled with the highest premiums) to the top (lowest
risk with the lowest premiums). Each insurance company has its own
``appetite'' for varying degrees of risk. This, of course, allows
insurance companies to limit the amount of insurance available and is
how they manage their risk or exposure to any one insured. Some
companies will insure only at the lowest levels of the tower (the so-
called ``working layers'') while others are interested only in the
uppermost (and therefore ``safest'') levels of the tower.
As coverage is built, the individual tower layers themselves are
often further subdivided and can consist of numerous insurance
companies each taking a share of the coverage in that layer. This
framework further spreads the risk for insurers: it is not uncommon for
ten or more insurance companies to participate in a particular layer
with each company committing to provide a portion of the coverage
(typically from $2.5M to $10M). Though increasingly rare, some
companies, if the layer is small enough, will commit to covering the
entire layer, usually in an amount not greater than $20M to $25M.
If you were to examine each commuter railroad's insurance tower,
you would find a distinct reliance on foreign markets, especially
London, and in particular Lloyd's of London, the world's largest
marketplace for excess casualty insurance. Bermuda is the second
largest marketplace for excess casualty insurance, and other dominant
carriers are located elsewhere in Europe.
As mentioned, purchasing excess liability insurance in foreign
markets is not by choice but by necessity. So, taking my experience for
the South Shoreline in Indiana, you would find that I have 22
participating insurers filling 35 slots on my insurance tower, a
majority of the slots are covered by London insurers (many were from
Lloyd's), seven were from Bermuda, and only one from the United States.
In Metra's last renewal, 22 slots were filled by London carriers,
six slots were filled by Bermuda carriers and one slot was filled by a
European carrier. Two additional carriers from London and one from
Bermuda filled slots covering punitive damages. No carriers from the
United States participated in the Metra tower.
Federal Law Does Not Mandate Insuring to the Cap
To be clear, commuter railroads are required to carry coverage up
to the federal cap only as a result of third-party contracts. Federal
law does not mandate that commuter railroads insure up to the federal
liability cap. Rather, third-party contracts--such as trackage rights,
purchase of service and vendor contracts--require that commuter
railroads insure and indemnify those third parties up to the liability
cap.
Many of these third-party agreements state that failure to maintain
excess liability coverage up to the federal liability cap could lead to
a commuter railroad being in breach of contract. As an example, a
commuter railroad's inability to insure to the cap could result in
vendors that supply software for PTC terminating a service that
commuter railroads are federally required to have in place. Without PTC
in place, the likely outcome is that commuter railroads would be forced
to shut down service.
A host railroad can also contractually forbid operation of the
commuter railroad on its tracks without the full limits of excess
liability insurance being in place. And other third-party service
providers could refuse to allow its conductors and engineers to operate
the railroad's rolling stock to transport passengers.
So, while commuter railroads are not federally compelled to insure
up to the liability cap, in all practical purposes, the cap serves as
an existential requirement for our ability to operate service for the
commuting public.
Given the hardened insurance market, recent indications of market
capacity, and inflation's impact on the CPI that will be used to
calculate the next increase in 2026, commuter railroads have a very
real concern that if we are unable to obtain the required insurance
within the 30-day implementation window we could be forced to shut down
our service, likely with little or no warning to our customers.
Simply, if coverage is unattainable, we will be forced into
shutting down until the coverage is obtained or some other type of
financial guarantee is provided to the third-party.
Existing Threats to Securing Coverage
``Market Capacity in the Excess Insurance Industry'' is the
headline you see when you consider the greatest threat to continued
coverage for any one of the commuter rail agencies nationwide. The
number of insurers in the market willing to offer coverage, and those
still in the excess insurance market who have coverage to place has
shrunk over the past ten years and particularly in the past five years,
in terms of the number of participating insurers and the amounts they
are willing to commit for coverage. In December 2023 we were advised
that excess insurance capacity available to the commuter rail industry
stood at just over $400 million.
Why is capacity in the excess market being reduced? It is a complex
set of market conditions that has absolutely nothing to do with
commuter rail safety or commuter rail claims.
The insurance industry is highly cyclical. A ``soft'' market cycle
is defined by lower insurance premiums, a broader appetite to assume
risks and coverages, increased capacity (the availability of high
limits), and greater underwriting flexibility. A ``hard'' market is
characterized by higher insurance premiums, diminished capacity, more
conservative underwriting, and fewer carriers writing certain coverage
lines or insuring certain specific industries.
After 15+ years of a soft market, the insurance industry began
experiencing a hardening of the market in 2018-2019. The effects of the
current market are being seen across most lines of insurance and the
majority of industries. Insurance experts we have consulted predict
that the hard market will continue through this decade and likely
beyond.
This exponentially hardening market is primarily due to greater
frequency of catastrophic weather events, economic and social inflation
\3\, and litigation funding \4\. Coupled with a multitude of excess
claims resulting in astronomically high settlements and verdicts, these
conditions have created a vast imbalance in underwriting financials--a
balance which the markets feel must be corrected for their own
survival. Although these trends are not necessarily new, their impact
is strengthening.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ Social inflation describes the phenomenon when insurance claims
costs are increasing more quickly than the standard rate of inflation.
Social inflation's impact on claim costs ultimately leads to higher
insurance costs for all consumers. Recently, incurred claim losses have
increased much more rapidly in recent years--much more rapidly than in
preceding years and more rapidly than economic inflation would predict.
\4\ Litigation funding is the practice where a third-party
unrelated to the lawsuit provides capital to a plaintiff involved in
litigation in return for a portion of any financial recovery from the
lawsuit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
These challenges really presented themselves in clear terms in 2020
when the commuter rail industry, along with many others, saw
significant rate increases--some as high as 75 percent from prior year
premiums, predominantly at the high excess level. Excess insurers had
suffered significant losses and decided to ``level their losses''.
Again, it is important to note that these ``losses'' in the
insurance market were not the result of losses incurred in the commuter
rail industry. I must underscore here the fact that we have all
implemented PTC, which would have prevented most of the high exposure
accidents over the past 20 years. The losses cited by insurance
providers are the result of hurricanes and wildfires and mass
shootings, as well as trends in auto claims in both frequency and
severity due to a decrease in oil prices (more driving), increased cell
phone and marijuana (distracted and impaired driving), and an increase
in overall technological distractions in vehicles.
This came at a time when insurers had historical underpricing of
premiums, an overall deterioration of reserves due to large payouts,
and a lack of investment for new carriers.
The losses were building at a rapid pace, impacting many markets
where excess liability coverage is used. The following examples
illustrate settlements or verdicts in excess of $500 million across
several industries over the past several years \5\:

Transportation (Rail)
These losses alone, all of which occurred in the United States,
total over $105 billion. It is worth noting that some claims do not
reveal themselves until many years later (i.e., product liability,
sexual abuse, etc.), circumstances for which insurers must hold
adequate reserves.
It is worth noting that commuter rail does not appear on this list.
Nevertheless, while commuter rail, as part of the excess liability
insurance market, benefits from sharing risk with extensive coverage
and low premiums in a soft market, it also suffers the shared
consequences of shrinking coverage and very high premiums in a hard
market fueled by social inflation and large losses.
As noted above, the largest commuter rail settlement to date
occurred in 2010 as a result of the Chatsworth, California incident in
which 25 people were killed and 135 injured. Since then, the commuter
railroads have invested billions in myriad new safety systems and
protocols. No commuter rail incident of the magnitude seen in
Chatsworth has occurred since.
Underwriting Capacity
Even more problematic for commuter rail than exponentially rising
premiums is the issue of ``capacity'' or, simply put, the availability
of enough insurance to satisfy the requirements of all the insureds in
a particular sector or market.
From the perspective of the excess liability markets, underwriting
capacity is the maximum amount of liability that an insurance company
agrees to assume from its underwriting activities. It represents an
insurer's ability to retain risk. It is important for an insurance
company to calculate and maintain its underwriting capacity so it will
be able to pay claims when needed.
An insurance company's potential for profitability depends on its
``appetite'' for risk. The more risk it assumes by underwriting certain
types of insurance policies (or by increasing the number of policies it
writes), the more premiums it can collect and invest. However, the more
risk an insurer accepts through the issuance of a large number of
policies or larger risks, the more the possibility exists that it may
become unprofitable, or worse, insolvent.
For an insurance company, striking the correct balance is essential
to maintaining its financial health. An insurer's maximum amount of
acceptable risk--or underwriting capacity--is a critical component of
its operations.
The goal of good underwriting is to generate premiums that exceed
the insurer's losses and expenses. They do that by underwriting
policies that cover less volatile risks (as commuter rail is perceived
to be), increasing premiums, and decreasing capacity.
Capacity for Commuter Rail
In general, capacity for lead excess insurers who underwrite
commuter rail has greatly decreased over the past ten to twenty years.
Non-lead excess insurers have decreased their capacity as well. The
London and Bermuda excess insurance markets continuously monitor and
adjust the amount of capacity they deploy. As a result of the current
hard market, further capacity withdrawal is expected over the next few
years.
Capacity withdrawal in the insurance industry is especially
problematic when the commuter rail industry is staring at a significant
increase in the federal cap on liability in 2026. Given recent
inflation, we are concerned that the cap could increase by $70 million
or more.
If one considers that 32 commuter railroads each will be competing
for this additional coverage to meet the 2026 cap, it will be
difficult--if not impossible--for all commuter railroads to obtain that
coverage by the current 30-day deadline. Our best opportunity to obtain
the new level of coverage is to have additional time to approach the
excess insurance liability markets and not compete with each other in a
30-day window. We need an immediate change to the 30-day implementation
requirement to provide up to 365 days to place this additional
coverage.
With respect to cost, the upper layers of a tower (for example
$28,000,000 in excess of $295,000,000, bringing coverage up to the
current $323M liability cap) cost an average of $16,000 per million. We
can expect the cost for one commuter railroad to acquire another $70
million in coverage in 2026 would likely be an additional $1,120,000.
In addition to seeking relief on the need to place this coverage
within 30 days of the 5-year liability cap adjustment, we must also
address to the overarching problem of a market with limited capacity
and the need to find alternative arrangements. Needless to say, if the
excess insurance market fails, Congress and the commuter railroads
together will need more than 30 days to put alternatives in place so
that vital transportation services around the country do not grind to a
halt.
What might those options include? One that we are considering is an
industry pool formed by and funded through premiums paid by commuter
railroads. Together, we are open to exploring all of our options, but
are clear-eyed as to the hurdles of establishing such a pool.
Alternative Arrangements
To assume that the current foreign excess liability market can
continue to support the requirements leveled on commuter railroads has
proven to be unreliable. We must search for stable alternatives and we
look forward to working with this committee and the Congress to find
workable solutions.
We are clear-eyed as to the hurdles of establishing an industry
insurance pool. A multi-state agreement to share liability is no small
undertaking, especially when navigating varying state liability caps
and tort immunity protections. We are actively discussing these options
and ask Congress to assist us by supporting studies and, potentially,
federally-supported loans needed for capitalizing a commuter rail
industry liability pool.
To assume that the current market can continue to support commuter
rail's needs has proven to be unreliable. We must search for stable
options that all willing commuter railroads can participate in, and we
look forward to working with this committee and the Congress to find
equitable solutions.
Amtrak and Commuter Railroads
My final point has to do with Amtrak's relationship with commuter
rail agencies and the need for the Surface Transportation Board to
serve as the final arbiter for any disputes that arise between these
two public assets over access rights to each other's property and the
associated costs.
Commuter railroads frequently interact with freight railroads and
Amtrak but have extremely limited access to the dispute resolution
mechanisms afforded by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) given the
current STB authorization language. This lack of a forum puts public
agencies--commuter railroads--at a significant disadvantage when it
comes to issues involving the freight railroads, especially the Class 1
railroads and Amtrak.
As background, in 1970 the Rail Passenger Service Act (RPSA)
provided freight railroads the opportunity to transfer their
chronically unprofitable intercity passenger operations to Amtrak. In
exchange, 22 freight railroads that were party to the agreement were
required to: (1) allow Amtrak ``to operate wherever it wished'' over
their lines; (2) ``grant Amtrak trains preference over their own
freight trains;'' and (3) allow the ICC (now Surface Transportation
Board) to determine compensation for Amtrak's operations if they could
not reach agreement with Amtrak. Freight railroads were also required
to pay some level of compensation to Amtrak.
In short, the RPSA relieved 22 private railroads of their passenger
common carrier obligations in exchange for Amtrak's right to priority
access to tracks for incremental cost. The commuter agencies and
handful of freight railroads were not part of this so-called ``grand
bargain'': they did not transfer passenger operations to Amtrak and
received no benefit from the Rail Passenger Service Act. Yet those who
were not party to the RPSA are held to the quid pro quo that they did
not make.
It is inequitable to continue to subject commuter railroads to only
the burden side of the grand bargain. Non-RPSA parties should not be at
risk of being forced to provide access to Amtrak trains, absent a
mutually acceptable agreement with Amtrak.
In April 2021 Amtrak sent letters to commuter railroads across the
country introducing their vision for Amtrak Connects US. ``We have
developed a vision for the future that involves strategic expansion to
increase train frequencies on some existing Amtrak corridor routes, and
initiate new corridors to connect additional city-pairs, called Amtrak
Connects US.'' The letter I personally received went on to state:
``Some of these additional trains will (emphasis added) operate on
NICTD rail lines.''
Again, commuter agencies were not party to the grand bargain, we
were not relieved of any financial burden assumed by Amtrak, and
therefore, the CRC asserts that commuter railroads should not be
subject to Amtrak's statutory ability to simply enforce it rights over
commuter rail properties. The public assets that are commuter railroads
must be on an equal footing to Amtrak and treated differently from the
22 freight railroads that received the benefit of the RPSA.
Further, commuter rail lines should not be seen as a preferred
alternative from Amtrak's current routes. In the Indiana case, Amtrak
desires to move their route from a freight line to the newly upgraded
South Shore Line. The freight line where Amtrak currently operates in
Indiana was just upgraded for their benefit; it received in excess of
$65 million in state-funded enhancements to improve Amtrak service on
the RPSA host railroad. Seemingly, Amtrak seeks to abandon the line
that was improved by Indiana taxpayers for their benefit in order to
avail themselves of the investments NICTD has secured to improve
service for our own ridership.
Should Amtrak exercise its statutory authority and begin operating
over the South Shore Line, their presence will negatively impact the
capacity and maintenance calculations made to support the federal
investment in NICTD service.
Further, under statute, Amtrak would only be required to pay the
incremental costs of its use of the line. Host railroads have no
leverage to negotiate or force Amtrak to pay anything approaching the
actual cost of their presence on a rail line, meaning, in this case,
that NICTD would be underwriting the cost of Amtrak service through
Indiana.
The equation creates a circumstance that requires commuter
railroads to subsidize the operating costs of Amtrak without fair
compensation.
Conversely, when a commuter railroad operates over Amtrak-owned
tracks, that access is billed at actual cost.
Amtrak has stated that they desire to reach an acceptable agreement
in Indiana, but they have also recently and vigorously defended their
statutory authority over commuter railroads.
Commuter authorities must be permitted to continue to realize the
full, long-term value of the public investment that has been made in
their lines and facilities and to protect the value of those
investments for their own passengers. All railroads not party to the
``grand bargain'' must be protected when Amtrak seeks to exercise its
will. There must be a forum for negotiation between equal parties for
access and compensation.
The Commuter Rail Coalition believes the best approach to ensure a
well-defined process for resolution is to adjust the statutory rights
of Amtrak to require good faith negotiations between Amtrak and
commuter rail systems when either party seeks trackage rights, and
forum to adjudicate disputes. In our view, we believe the Surface
Transportation Board is the right entity to deal with disputes between
Amtrak and commuter railroads and we suggest that the STB be empowered
with the authority to review and determine terms of any agreement
between Amtrak and a commuter rail agency that remains in dispute.
Conclusion
Chairman Nehls and Ranking Member Payne, I want to thank you again
for the opportunity to explain some of the challenges we face in the
commuter rail industry. If there is one message I wish to leave with
you today, it is that commuter railroads face a changing landscape as
our customers modify their travel patterns, and we embrace those
opportunities that allow for us to offer safe reliable and affordable
service. We look forward working cooperatively with you and the
Congress to find the most expeditious, cost-effective solutions to the
issues discussed here today. We all climbed a steep hill to meet the
PTC mandate. The challenges we now face are equally as formidable but
there are pathways to success. We look forward to working towards those
solutions.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mr. Noland.
Ms. Johnson, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF DEBRA A. JOHNSON, GENERAL MANAGER AND CHIEF
EXECUTIVE OFFICER, REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT (RTD),
DENVER, COLORADO

Ms. Johnson. Good morning, Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member
Larsen, Congresswoman Foushee, and members of the subcommittee.
I am pleased to join my industry colleagues to discuss
opportunities and challenges facing commuter rail operators
nationwide.
The face of commuter rail is evolving. This vital public
service is now experiencing a renaissance. Agencies across the
country are delivering service that match needs of a hybrid
workforce, as well as to provide more attractive mobility
options to discretionary customers. To advance these
enhancements, investments are a must.
On March 29, the Federal Railroad Administration released
the Notices of Funding Opportunity for fiscal years 2023 and
2024: $2.4 billion for rail safety and infrastructure
improvements. Amtrak and short line railroads are eligible to
apply, but not commuter rail agencies.
The CRISI program, administered by FRA, funds projects that
improve the safety, efficiency, and reliability of intercity
passenger and freight rail, yet commuter rail priorities are
not eligible for direct funding under the CRISI program. Since
CRISI was first initiated, Amtrak has seen its access to direct
funding grow exponentially while commuter railroads must
compete with all other surface modes for discretionary funding.
There is no existing specific U.S. DOT program that is focused
on commuter rail infrastructure and rolling stock. Commuter
rail agencies seeking Federal assistance to maintain a safe,
efficient, and reliable network have been shortchanged.
Speaking to rail safety, most commuter rail capital needs
are related to safety investments that ensure commuter rail
remains one of the safest mobility options. When agencies
invested over $4 billion to implement Positive Train Control
systems nationwide, this investment came at the expense of
locally prioritized improvements and/or service. Capital
reinvestment projects were postponed or delayed indefinitely,
while operational safety was maintained at a significant but
necessary cost.
As the subcommittee considers future rail safety
legislation, the commuter rail industry welcomes the policies
and practices that may emerge in that legislation. That said,
reliable Federal funding for continued commuter rail safety
investments is paramount for long-term sustainability.
Hazardous materials are frequently transported by freight
railroads across alignments shared by commuter rail. The cost
associated with these inherent risks must be borne by the
freight railroads as a cost of doing business, thus they must
be held accountable for their safety practices.
The Commuter Rail Coalition supports the concepts advanced
in the Senate's proposed Railway Safety Act, legislation
introduced by Senators Brown and Vance last year. That said,
the coalition's primary concern with the legislation is the
significant cost that commuter rail agencies are being asked to
absorb for the benefit of private entities, specifically with
the wayside technology requirements such as hot boxes.
It cannot be overstated that such requirements are for the
freight railroad's sole benefit. Considering that commuter
railroads operate under a much stricter safety regime than
freight railroads, commuter rail operators foresee little, if
any, benefit from the hot box detector introduction on our
rights-of-way. While the Senate bill proposes the installation
cost to commuter railroads be partially offset by a new
reimbursable Federal funding program, coalition members have
significant concerns with this requirement.
First, taxpayers should not shoulder private entity costs
of safely moving freight.
Second, the reimbursement program envisioned in the Senate
bill would neither fully cover the hot box detector
installation costs nor the required ongoing maintenance.
And third, many commuter railroads currently have unfunded
capital projects that are a matter of public necessity.
Diverting public funds for private-sector purpose is not good
Government.
Congress has an opportunity to address these concerns and
several others in any final legislation.
On behalf of the Commuter Rail Coalition, we look forward
to further collaboration.
Mr. Chairman, Congresswoman Foushee, and Ranking Member
Larsen, it has been a pleasure to appear before the
subcommittee today to share concerns as an industry and, most
importantly, to express our support for achieving even greater
safety levels in the commuter rail industry. Once again, I
offer our collective expertise and assistance as you move
forward on safety legislation and, ultimately, the
reauthorization of the surface transportation bill. Thank you.
[Ms. Johnson's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and Chief
Executive Officer, Regional Transportation District (RTD), Denver,
Colorado
RTD Rail Operations
RTD operates light rail and commuter rail lines within its 2,342
square-mile service area. The Denver metro region has long championed
rail transit as a necessary transportation mode. The agency's first
light rail line commenced revenue service nearly 30 years ago.
FasTracks, the agency's transit expansion program, at the time of
approval by voters in 2004, was the largest such program in the nation.
Together with a concessionaire partner, Denver Transit Partners/Denver
Transit Operators, RTD's Commuter Rail operations consist of four
commuter rail lines, one of which is directly operated by RTD. Commuter
rail service spans from Denver International Airport in the east to
adjoining suburbs in the north and west of the metro region. According
to the 2023 Public Transportation Fact Book published by the American
Public Transportation Association, RTD experienced the highest
ridership per mile of track of any commuter railroad in the country.
Commuter Rail Eligibility under the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure
and Safety Improvements (CRISI) Program
The face of commuter rail is evolving. This vital public service,
first established to move a workforce from the more affordable suburbs
into the city center during morning and evening rush hours, is
experiencing a renaissance. More and more, agencies across the country
are introducing service that mirrors a regional rail approach--that is:
bi-directional all-day service to serve the post-pandemic travel
patterns of a hybrid workforce and to provide additional or more
attractive travel options to discretionary customers.
To advance these adaptations, investments must continue to be made
into the essential public assets that are commuter railroads. Prior to
the pandemic, commuter railroads across the US moved approximately half
a billion people annually (as compared to Amtrak's 33 million).
As a transit mode, commuter railroads are accountable to two
different agencies within the Department of Transportation. In certain
congressional circles, there is some debate as to whether commuter rail
should be considered rail transportation or transit with respect to
committee jurisdictional responsibility. Media outlets regularly
conflate ``passenger rail'' as including commuter rail operations when,
typically, this is simply shorthand for ``Amtrak.'' And, remarkably,
the Surface Transportation Board has no authority to intervene when
commuter railroads are party to a dispute with Amtrak.
It is unfortunate, then, that Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and
Safety Improvement (CRISI) Act funds the privately held short-line
railroads' projects along with Amtrak's, while explicitly excluding a
transit mode that moves vastly more people every year in comparison.
The Coalition has a vested interest in working with Congress to correct
this critical oversight.
Earlier this month, the Federal Railroad Administration released
the notice of funding opportunity for the FY23 and FY24 funding: $2.4
billion for rail safety and infrastructure improvements--but none for
commuter rail.
The CRISI program is administered by the Federal Railroad
Administration and funds projects that improve the safety, efficiency,
and reliability of intercity passenger and freight rail, yet commuter
rail priorities are not eligible for funding under the CRISI program.
Authorized by Congress in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation
(FAST) Act, funding under this program has grown significantly since
its inception--from $200 million initially to $1.5 billion in FY2023
and $1.1 billion in the recently enacted FY2024 appropriations bill.
Currently, the CRISI program limits eligibility only to projects
directed by freight rail and intercity passenger rail, specifically
Amtrak in this instance. If a commuter railroad benefits from the
program, it is only as an ancillary partner to another entity's
project, as commuter rail operators are not eligible direct recipients
for CRISI funds.
Since CRISI was first initiated, Amtrak has seen its access to
direct funding grow exponentially, while commuter railroads must
compete with all other surface modes for discretionary funding.
There is no specific program in existence at USDOT, either within
the Federal Railroad Administration or the Federal Transit
Administration, that is focused on commuter rail projects.
Commuter rail agencies must compete for funding in large
discretionary programs at the USDOT that attract competition from all
other surface modes and a wide array of projects. This includes, for
example, pedestrian walkways and bicycle paths, and thus commuter
railroads are at a disadvantage from a significant amount of
competition.
RTD's commuter rail service is relatively new, and the agency does
not currently face the pressure of trying to absorb significant
``lumpy'' investments in the manner that similarly situated agencies
do. However, it will not be very long before RTD, too, must endeavor to
make infrastructure improvements and replacements as well as to begin
rebuilding and replacing rolling stock. These investments often come
along every 10 to 20 years; venturing to find ways for commuter rail
agencies to absorb costs within the confines of the formula funds
transit agencies receive is extremely challenging. What often happens
is that agencies make investments to forestall major makeovers with the
hope that resources will become available at a later date; they may
have no viable options absent other sources of available funding.
Commuter rail agencies could plan much more effectively and would
likely be able to make better economic decisions if they were able to
tap into CRISI funds or a similar capital investment funding source.
Program managers at the USDOT, the Federal Railroad Administration, and
Federal Transit Administration would be able to look at the commuter
rail industry as a whole and better plan for each agency's upcoming
vital capital replacement needs.
There may be disagreement from some, including short-line
railroads, that commuter rail projects should gain eligibility under
the CRISI program; these entities have expressed trepidation regarding
potential competition from commuter rail for funds they would otherwise
benefit from. It must be stated, however, that commuter rail agencies
are publicly funded organizations that rely heavily on state and local
funding for capital needs in order to provide a public benefit, with no
federal program dedicated for offsetting infrastructure and rolling
stock costs. Whether these needs compete with or supersede those of
privately-owned entities who also struggle with capital replacement
demands, it is, of course, Congress' prerogative to decide that
question. The fact remains that commuter rail operators' needs are
great, and allowing them to go unaddressed, while at the same time
funding in large amounts those of private entities, will mean that
commuter rail assets will be allowed to degrade. Agencies and their
customers seeking safe, efficient, reliable transportation solutions
have been short-changed with respect to access to federal funding.
Rail Safety
Most commuter rail capital needs are related to safety investments,
which ensure that commuter rail remains one of the safest
transportation modes available. When agencies invested over $4 billion
to deploy Positive Train Control (PTC) systems nationwide, it came at
the expense of locally prioritized improvements and upgrades. Capital
reinvestment projects were pushed back or delayed indefinitely, while
operational safety was maintained at a significant, but necessary,
cost. Moving forward, as the subcommittee considers future rail safety
legislation, the commuter rail industry stands ready to embrace the
policies and practices that may emerge in that legislation. That said,
reliable federal funding for continued commuter rail safety investments
is needed to ensure long-term sustainability nationwide.
The Commuter Rail Coalition supports the concepts advanced in the
Senate's proposed Railway Safety Act legislation introduced by Senators
Brown and Vance last year. Because some commuter rail agencies host
freight operations carrying hazardous material, the Coalition also
recognizes the important role it must play in the eventual solution.
Commuter rail's safety record speaks for itself, and the industry
stands ready to work with Congress to identify solutions that ensure
the safety of commercial freight movements over shared tracks, while
not placing the safety burden--or risk--on the taxpayer or public
agencies. Safety is of utmost importance to every commuter rail
provider.
The Coalition's primary concern is related to costs. In this case--
as the Senate language is currently drafted--commuter rail agencies are
concerned with being asked to absorb significant costs for the benefit
of private entities only. This is, of course, in reference to mandates
requiring wayside technology, such as hotboxes, and the resulting
responsibility for the high cost for installing and maintaining these
devices. It cannot be overstated that such requirements are for the
freight railroads' sole benefit. Considering that commuter railroads
operate under a much stricter safety regime than freight railroads,
commuter rail operators foresee little if any benefit from the
introduction of hotbox detectors on our right-of-way.
To reiterate, commuter rail operators are held to, and operate at,
a much higher standard in the interest of customer safety. Passenger
railroads are required to inspect rail vehicles at least daily, under
FRA's Part 238 requirements; given the nature of commuter rail
operations, on-board personnel have eyes on equipment each time they
step off the train at station stops.
In contrast, freight railroads do not operate in the same manner,
and are not held to the same inspection standards. For this reason,
freight railroads have in some locations relied on wayside detectors to
be alerted to degraded equipment. Class 1 rail consists can move 1,500
miles or more between visual equipment inspections, whereas commuter
rail operators have much shorter intervals between examination by
maintenance personnel--in most cases fewer than 100 miles.
Hazardous materials are frequently moved by freight railroads
across commuter rail properties. The risks and the cost of keeping
surrounding communities safe must be borne by the freight railroads as
their cost of doing business. And they must be held to account for
their safety practices.
While the Senate bill proposes the costs to commuter railroads of
installing new required technology be partially offset by a new
reimbursable federal funding program, the members of the Coalition take
issue with this requirement on several points. First, taxpayers should
not shoulder the cost of private entities safely moving freight. The
associated cost could be absorbed by freight railroads, who can easily
pass the costs onto their customers. Second, the reimbursement program
envisioned in the Senate bill would neither fully cover the cost of
installation of the required hotbox detectors nor the required ongoing
maintenance. Third, many commuter railroads currently have a myriad
unfunded capital projects that are a matter of public necessity;
diverting public funds for a private sector purpose is anathema to
serving the public good.
Congress has an opportunity to address these concerns and a number
of others in any final legislation.
Excess Liability Coverage
Federal statute directs the Secretary of Transportation to adjust
the cap for excess liability coverage of commuter railroads every five
years by applying the consumer price index.
Commuter railroads have existing liability limits under the law in
each state in which they operate. Rather than being required by federal
law to carry excess liability coverage, however, it is commuter
railroads' contractual obligations to host railroads, PTC system
contractors and suppliers, and other similar entities that require
indemnification and coverage up to the federal limit.
In RTD's case, due to incremental increases in the federal
liability limit, which currently sits at $323 million, the cost of
excess liability coverage has grown tremendously over time and
currently exceeds $1 million annually. Once notice of the increased
limit is publicly posted by USDOT, railroads currently have no more
than 30 days to acquire the necessary additional coverage. Compounding
this challenge is the fact that ever fewer insurers, whether domestic
or international, are willing to take on this level of insurance risk.
This means that, following posting of each new liability cap, commuter
railroad representatives must quickly travel overseas to seek coverage
from the dwindling handful of insurers globally, primarily in markets
in London and Bermuda, that are willing to extend coverage to meet the
federal cap.
If the federal liability limit were to be raised to the level
beyond which these few insurers are willing to offer coverage, commuter
railroads would simply not be able to obtain insurance and would
therefore be forced to suspend operations.
To address this possible market failure, Congress must extend the
window, from the posting date to the effective date of any new federal
liability limit, to a full 365 days. Doing so would allow railroads
sufficient time to seek excess liability coverage and, barring
availability of this coverage in the insurance market, would allow
Congress time to act to intervene while commuter railroads continue to
operate.
Notification to Commuter Rail Agencies for Trains Carrying Hazardous
Materials
Should the House consider a similar hazardous materials
notification requirement such as that contemplated in the Senate
Railway Safety Act, the Commuter Rail Coalition encourages the
inclusion of commuter rail agencies on the list of entities receiving
advance notification of the movement of such materials across their
property. Currently, commuter rail agencies receive no notification of
hazardous materials being transported on their property or their
service territory. Having advance notification would allow commuter
rail agencies to prepare appropriate responses to any occurrence that
may impact customers or employees.
Requirements for Equipment Intended to Prevent Wheel Bearing Failures
The Senate bill as currently structured would require trains
carrying hazardous materials to be scanned by hotbox detectors at a
minimum of every 10 miles to prevent wheel bearing failures and
possible derailments. The Commuter Rail Coalition questions the value
of the outdated technology of wayside detectors, and, if such mandates
are required on property owned by commuter rail agencies, the cost of
installation and ongoing maintenance for any such wayside monitoring
devices should be borne by freight carriers as a cost of their
business, not by the public in the interest of their own safety.
Research through Centers of Excellence for Freight and Passenger
Services
The Commuter Rail Coalition sincerely applauds congressional
efforts to conduct critical research by creating Centers of Excellence
to study not only improvements in operating practices, but also new
emerging technologies that could help address the challenge of trying
to ensure against disasters such as that which took place in Ohio. The
Coalition strongly supports all research efforts that can help improve
vehicle safety, to also include passenger rail vehicles. And while the
legislation will undoubtedly be focused mainly on the transport of
goods, especially hazardous materials, a similar focus should be
applied to research for on-board sensors that alert train crews to
developing mechanical failures; such advancements will benefit both
freight and passenger railroads.
The Commuter Rail Coalition further applauds any additional
research on passenger car designs that can help achieve lighter weight
vehicles with improved safety. Current passenger rail car design
standards are outdated and need to be reviewed and updated,
particularly in light of the positive train control technology required
to be in place across all commuter railroads.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Ms. Johnson.
Mr. Dech, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.
Turn on your little button.
Well, pull the mic closer. It should turn on red. Do you
see a little red?
Maintenance, maintenance. Get on it.
[Laughter.]
[Pause.]
Mr. Dech. Let me try this again. OK, thank you very much.
Mr. Nehls. My apologies.
Mr. Dech. No, no.
Mr. Nehls. All right.
Mr. Dech. I am sure it was my fault.

TESTIMONY OF DAVID W. DECH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SOUTH FLORIDA
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY (TRI-RAIL)

Mr. Dech. Thank you, Chairman Nehls and Congresswoman
Foushee, for the opportunity to testify today before this
subcommittee. My name is David Dech, and I am the executive
director of the South Florida Regional Transportation
Authority, and we provide commuter rail service on behalf of
the Florida Department of Transportation, known as Tri-Rail.
I am here today to talk about two main topics: the benefits
that the commuter rail industry has derived from utilizing
outside private contracted services, and some additional views
on overall rail safety.
But first I would like to add that the additional funding
that we have received through the Federal formula funds and the
new railcar replacement program, both a result of the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, have provided critical
assistance that will allow us to address important capital
replacement needs.
Also, we all recognize that COVID-19 has fundamentally
changed the way we live and work, including altering commuting
patterns. I am very pleased to report that Tri-Rail ridership
has steadily grown over the last few years, and as of the last
couple of weeks, we are exceeding prepandemic ridership
numbers.
Regarding contracted services, the South Florida
Transportation Authority, as well as my previous employer,
Capital Metro in Austin, Texas, rely heavily on private outside
contractors to provide our services. I have worked with both
bundled and unbundled or bifurcated contracts, wherein you
contract with either a single contractor for all of your needs,
or you split those contracts up among different companies.
Either of these strategies can be beneficial, depending on the
needs of the commuter rail agency.
SFRTA has relied on outside contracting since its inception
in 1989. These contracts are competitively procured. Outside
contracting is particularly advantageous when standing up a
relatively new railroad, allowing the agency to leverage the
expertise of the private sector to roll out the service and
maintain it while it matures. While most of the focus is on
large operating and maintenance contracts, there are other
opportunities for specialized competition, as well. Examples
would be PTC maintenance, security fare collection, all the way
to leasing of rolling stock.
We believe that we benefit from competition. There are
seven private contractors who offer a full range of services:
Herzog Transit Services, Keolis, Alternate Concepts
Incorporated, Amtrak, Bombardier/Alstom, RATPDev, and Transdev.
This subcommittee in the near future may consider
legislation to further improve rail safety. As a railroad
operations executive who has served in both the freight and
passenger worlds, I would like to offer a few observations.
But first let me emphasize that the Commuter Rail Coalition
supports the concepts advanced in the Senate's proposed Railway
Safety Act legislation. Where we differ is who should bear the
costs, and whether there are other technologies that may be
useful. Commuter railroads are taxpayer and farebox funded, and
we believe that the installation and operating expenses for
wayside defect detectors or other equivalent technologies
should be borne by the entities benefiting from such
technology, and in this case, that would be the freight
carriers.
Mr. Chairman, please allow me to be clear on this point.
The commuter rail industry fully supports the introduction of
any technology or change in practice that will lead to improved
rail safety. We need to ensure that these changes do not
degrade the quality of our service, and we do have concerns of
the potential impact of an increased number of hot box
detectors on our service levels.
We also fully embrace the funding of the research and
development of new technologies that may meet or exceed the
abilities of existing wayside defect detectors.
Chairman Nehls and Congresswoman Foushee, I again want to
express my thanks for the honor and the opportunity to be part
of this process and share my experience with contract services
and the commuter rail safety act, and I will be here to answer
any questions that you may have. Thank you.
[Mr. Dech's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of David W. Dech, Executive Director, South Florida
Regional Transportation Authority (Tri-Rail)
Introduction
Thank you Chairman Nehls and Ranking Member Payne for the
opportunity to testify today before the subcommittee. My name is Dave
Dech and I am the Executive Director for the South Florida Regional
Transportation Authority--the provider of commuter rail services known
as ``Tri-Rail'' in South Florida, serving three counties--West Palm
Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade. You have heard from my esteemed
colleagues today on the very unique issues and challenges facing the
commuter rail agencies across the nation. Today I wish to focus my
remarks on two important issues: first, the benefits the commuter rail
industry has derived from its extensive use of contracted services with
private contract service providers, and; two, some additional views as
an industry on strategies to improve overall rail safety, especially in
the aftermath of the tragic derailment and fires that occurred in East
Palestine, Ohio earlier last year.
In addition, let me also add that the federal funding we have
received from increased formula funds and the new rail car replacement
program that were both the result of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
have provided critical assistance that has allowed us to address
capital replacement challenges that have been a difficult problem for
several years. We look forward to working with the committee to address
a more predictable and reliable funding sources for capital replacement
needs that the commuter rail industry desperately needs.
During my career leading two commuter rail agencies that utilize
private contract operators, I have gained a unique perspective on the
benefits of contracted services. My current system, Tri-Rail, has
contracted for all services--Train Operations, Maintenance of
Infrastructure and Maintenance of Equipment since its inception in
1989. My prior employer, the Capital Metropolitan Transportation
Authority in Austin, Texas (``Capital Metro'') operates a commuter rail
system throughout the Austin urbanized area also utilizing contracted
services for all functions.
At Tri-Rail, all our services have been competitively procured and
we have contracted with several different contractors over the life of
the agency. We have used what is commonly referred to as ``bundled''
and ``unbundled'' contracts, which is a format whereby agencies decide
if they wish to have one contractor handling all aspects of service--
train operations, maintenance of rolling stock and maintenance of the
right-of-way and facilities and other infrastructure--such as stations.
And while most attention is focused on these larger contracts, we also
contract for many other critical services, such as: train dispatching
services, signals and communication, positive train control
maintenance, station operations and maintenance, security services, to
name a few.
When you look across the entire commuter rail industry, you will
find many agencies contract for direct provision of train services much
in the way Tri-Rail does, as well as many other services. And in some
cases, commuter rail agencies provide a mix of contracted train
operations and maintenance as well as services that are provided
directly by agency employees. An example of this approach is seen in
the commuter system in Chicago, where Metra, since a 1983
reorganization, has continued to utilize purchase-of-service agreements
with freight rail companies--the Union Pacific and the BNSF railroad--
to provide service on three lines; the remainder of their service on
six other lines is provided directly by Metra employees. Metra owns all
the rolling stock and is responsible for all stations along with the
respective municipalities.
Why Contracted Services
The commuter rail industry has a unique history that has offered
ample opportunity to use contracted services wherever possible. When
Tri-Rail commenced service in 1989, thus becoming one of the first new
start commuter rail services in the US in many years, the federal
government strongly encouraged consideration of competitive contracting
wherever possible in the provision of public transportation services.
Tri-Rail saw that by contracting with a service provider, they could
stand up a commuter rail operation in a short period of time by
bringing in the expertise that a contractor could offer. Hiring and
training railroad employees is a skill and process that requires unique
expertise and acquiring that expertise through contracted services
makes economic sense in many cases.
And 35 years later Tri-Rail has found that through this
relationship they can save money and benefit from the innovative
approaches offered by a contract operator. This has allowed Tri-Rail to
be responsive to changing demographics and ridership patterns in South
Florida and I would say has had a hand in allowing us to continue to
respond to growing demand in ridership, even beyond pre-pandemic
levels.
An examination of the commuter rail industry shows contracted
services in more than 14 of the 32 commuter rail operations nationwide,
including: Los Angeles (MetroLink); Virginia Railway Express; MARC; and
many others that utilize various forms of contracted services.
There are approximately seven private contractors offering a full
range of contracted services, including: Herzog Transit Services,
Keolis, Alternate Concepts, Inc., Amtrak, Bombardier/Alstom, RATPDev
and Transdev. There have been other players offering contracted
services to commuter rail agencies in the recent past and vehicle
manufacturers such as Bombardier/Alstom who also offer maintenance of
equipment services.
The question of whether to bundle or unbundle services is one that
each agency makes individually. Some agencies may have the in-house
ability to perform certain functions, such as facility maintenance,
which may provide a more economic solution than contracted services.
Also, agencies have found that it may be of benefit to contract with
individual contractors who offer a certain level of expertise and
qualification in particular areas. As with all things, this unbundling
of contracted services can require additional resources for oversight
and coordination. Again, these are the conditions that each agency
weighs in making this decision.
I can say that during my experience at Tri-Rail and before in
Austin, I have found that contracted services have provided a level of
transparency and accountability that is key to smooth operations and
cost controls. At Tri-Rail we believe that contracted services provide
a level of expertise and stability with economic value that we would
have difficulty maintaining if we provided the service directly with
our own employees. This of course is not to say that directly-operated
services do not have an important place in the commuter rail industry.
Directly operated service provides direct accountability and
greater cost transparency. Plus, there is no profit factored into the
cost of operations and maintenance. Additionally, because contracts are
competitively procured, there can be challenges when a new contract
operator assumes control under a new agreement. Tri-Rail has had
experience in the past with transitions from one contractor to another,
and while I was not in my current position when those transitions
occurred, what I understand is that the transitions were managed very
effectively, mainly because Tri-Rail employees committed the required
time and effort to assure a smooth transition.
The bottom line is that the commuter rail industry has made
extensive use of contracted services and has found great value in the
expertise of contractors. We continue to explore various options and
experiment with differing arrangements and fortunately there has been
strong interest from long time contractors such as Herzog and Transdev,
as well as growing interest from newer players in the market. Our
challenge from an industry standpoint is to work with our federal,
state and local partners to ensure that our contracting process is
streamlined, concise and not exclusionary or overly complex so as to
make potential contractors question the level of effort required to
respond to our solicitations. Most contractors will tell you they often
invest in excess of $100,000 to research, prepare and submit a proposal
for contracted services.
Mr. Chairman, we in the commuter rail industry believe that the
federal government should continue to embrace contracted services
wherever grantees believe it makes sense. Going forward we see new
emerging opportunities to contract with entities who provide rolling
stock and locomotives under lease arrangements and the use of federal
grant monies for this purpose should continue to be allowed and
encouraged. One of the greatest challenges we face is transitioning to
cleaner and more robust equipment and in today's world where procuring
new equipment requires long lead times, leasing with options for
maintenance through a private contractor often makes strong economic
sense.
Rail Safety
This subcommittee in the near term may consider legislation to
improve rail safety. As my colleague Debra Johnson outlined, the
Commuter Rail Coalition supports the concepts advanced in the proposed
Senate's Railway Safety Act legislation introduced by Senators Brown
and Vance, and believes changes to the freight railroad's inspection
practices are necessary to ensure the safety of the communities through
which they travel.
Commuter Railroads, as public entities funded by public tax
dollars, are concerned that the costs associated with any new
requirements for the movement of private commerce on privately-owned
railroads should be borne by those private entities. I am of course
addressing the mandate requiring new infrastructure or wayside
technology, such as hotboxes and where the responsibility for the high
cost for installing and maintaining these devices will fall. It cannot
be overlooked that such requirements are for the freight railroads'
sole benefit and while they often transport hazardous materials over
trackage owned by commuter rail agencies, unfortunately commuter rail
agencies do not derive similar benefits from these wayside detectors.
Mr. Chairman, let me be very clear on this point. The Commuter Rail
industry fully supports the introduction of any technology or changes
in practices that will in any way help to improve rail safety--even in
areas of freight movement where we have no direct input. We just want
to assure that any solutions proposed do not in any way degrade our
quality of service, and we do have significant concerns about the
operating implications for the use of hot box detectors on our rail
territory.
As a current CEO having overseen operations at two commuter rail
agencies and previously as an operating executive for a Class I
railroad, I can tell you that the use of wayside detectors where there
is passenger operations can be quite disruptive due to false positive
readings. I have witnessed numerous occasions where a detector notifies
a train crew of an elevated temperature reading for a particular
journal bearing, only for it to turn out to be an inaccurate reading.
The result is a stopped train on the right-of-way with resulting delays
for all other trains behind it, in particular passenger trains on a
timetable.
The standard operating practice for all railroads that receive an
elevated temperature reading from a wayside detector is to stop the
train and have the on-board crew conduct a visual inspection. And if
the specified area of the reading does not yield the discovery of a
problem, crews are instructed to inspect the 4-5 cars before and after
the identified car. This is a time-consuming process that can cause a
lot of disruption for commuter operations as well as other freight and
intercity movements.
This is the reason for our concern over investing in a technology
that may not have the same reliability as other new emerging sensor
technologies. In comparison to the mandate to adopt PTC, the industry
had many years of research completed and while the technology was being
finalized, its performance and reliability proved to be quite strong.
In the case of wayside detectors, the technology is known to be very
limited, less reliable and quite expensive to install and maintain,
especially in northern climates. Pushing forward to bring new sensor
technologies to the market seems to be an approach that will yield
better results from a safety standpoint, as well as less disruptive to
operations on the corridor.
In addition to concerns about the performance of hotbox detectors,
we are also very concerned that if mandated in any subsequent
legislation, the cost for acquisition will rise exponentially. Supply
capacity for the devices is already limited due to minimal historical
demand. The combination of significant new demand and limited supply
will surely result in cost increases of a large magnitude. And of
course, we are also concerned about the resulting need for additional
maintenance and testing required by commuter agency personnel to assure
these detectors are working properly.
We have raised these concerns during consideration of the Senate
bill and we are very appreciative of inclusion in their bill of a
provision to allay some of the costs for installation. We hope to be
able to continue the discussion as legislation moves forward that will
yield the best results at an affordable cost.
Conclusion
Chairman Nehls and Ranking Member Payne, I want to thank you again
for the opportunity to discuss the experience with contracted services
in the commuter rail industry. I also appreciate the opportunity to add
a bit more detail to earlier testimony on rail safety.
As my colleagues have pointed out in their testimony, commuter
railroads face a changing landscape as our customers modify their
travel patterns. The commuter rail industry believes contracted
services allow us to better respond to these changing dynamics while
controlling costs. And Congress should emphasize the importance of
allowing commuter rail agencies to use all forms of federal assistance
for contracted services and leasing of rolling stock.
We really look forward to working cooperatively with you and the
Congress to find permanent solutions to the issues discussed here
today.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you. I want to get it right. It's Dech,
correct?
Mr. Dech. I have been called much worse. Yes, Dech is
correct.
Mr. Nehls. All right. Thank you, Mr. Dech. I now recognize
Mr. Corbett for 5 minutes, sir.

TESTIMONY OF KEVIN S. CORBETT, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, NEW JERSEY TRANSIT, ON BEHALF OF THE NORTHEAST
CORRIDOR COMMISSION

Mr. Corbett. Yes. Good morning, Chair Nehls, Ranking Member
Larsen, and Congresswoman Foushee. Thank you for inviting me
here to discuss the BIL and its impact not only on the
Northeast Corridor, which serves up to 800,000 rail passengers
every day, but on commuter railroads across the Nation.
I'm speaking today both as cochair of the Northeast
Corridor Commission, which I serve alongside my fellow cochair,
FRA Administrator Amit Bose, in addition to my role as
president and CEO of NJ Transit, the largest statewide transit
system in the country and the third largest overall. I am also
cofounder of the Commuter Rail Coalition, an association of 25
commuter rail agencies acting together to engage and educate
stakeholders on the value commuter railroads bring to the
communities they serve.
As some of you may remember, I testified before this
committee in both 2021 and 2020, where I largely covered NJ
Transit's experience implementing Positive Train Control. We at
NJ Transit remain extremely proud of the herculean effort to
successfully achieve PTC certification by the December 2020
deadline, although, to be clear, significant challenges with
PTC still persist.
For example, there are currently more than five variations
of PTC systems nationwide, which can create significant
interoperability challenges. And of course, there are
significant and ongoing costs associated with upgrades and
maintenance of PTC going forward. NJ Transit alone has spent
more than half a billion dollars on this unfunded mandate, and
this figure will only continue to grow. We continue to advocate
for creation of a more cost-effective, unified, standardized
national system across railroads throughout the country: Call
it PTC 2.0.
While the implementation of PTC represents a significant
step forward in our commitment to safety and operational
efficiency, it also highlights the broader context of the
challenges we face in rail transportation, stemming from
historical underinvestment and the inherent complexities of
balancing the needs of commuter and intercity rail service.
For decades prior to the public takeover of rail transit,
our country disinvested in railroad infrastructure, which left
Amtrak and the commuter railroads with a huge hill to climb, a
burden we still carry on today.
Further exacerbating capital funding challenges, many
agencies continue to face operating budget challenges, as well.
When there is a hole in the operating budget, many transit
agencies are forced to use capital budget dollars to fill the
gap, an insidious practice that ultimately undermines long-term
infrastructure resilience and growth.
Whether our railroad network is in the hands of private- or
public-sector operators, there is no magic wand. We cannot
improve efficiency, reliability, and safety for our customers
without adequate funding for both operating and capital. As
such, I am a strong advocate for commuter rail systems to have
access to the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety
Improvements, CRISI, program, just as intercity rail does now,
or a similar source of such funding.
While the markets we serve may be different, both intercity
and commuter rail systems have significant operating and
capital needs. To be certain, NJ Transit supports Amtrak, and
we have a good working relationship with them, although there
is always a natural conflict, a tension that exists between
intercity and commuter rail, which should not be an
insurmountable barrier, but rather a challenge to be managed
with strategic collaboration and open dialogue.
Speaking more broadly about funding, BIL has been
transformational for both commuters and intercity rail. Thanks
to the work of Congress and the Biden administration on the
BIL, the NEC has its first-ever source of dedicated, multiyear
funding, providing predictability needed to more efficiently
deliver a major capital program. This historic investment weans
us off what I call the ``Transit Hunger Games,'' where agencies
routinely compete against each other for constrained funding
that is never enough to maintain even a state-of-good-repair,
much less the ability to modernize or expand.
In addition to the increase in formula funding for commuter
railroads through the BIL, the FRA and FTA are awarding
billions of additional dollars through various discretionary
competitive grants. These grants are vitally important as we
and other transit agencies pursue sweeping projects that are
beyond the scope of our traditional capital budgets.
Projects such as AI-powered safety systems with light rail
vehicles that are currently being funded by the FTA, for
example, where we are being able to invest in safe
modernization and state-of-good-repair to ensure that our
constituents get safety and service improves out of every
dollar that we spend.
A perfect example of what transit agencies can do when
given necessary Federal resources is New Jersey Transit's $2
billion Portal Bridge replacement project, which is on time, on
budget, and 50 percent complete in just 2 years, with the first
track scheduled to open in 2026. Portal North Bridge, as many
of you know, is a critical single point of failure on the
Northeast Corridor between New Jersey and New York, which is
also a critical link between DC and Boston.
Switching hats for a moment to my role as cochair of the
NECC, it is important to note that the BIL provides a
significant downpayment on Connect NEC 2037, or C37, a 15-year
plan covering 300 projects, along with a comprehensive renewal
program for state-of-good-repair work, including track, signal,
and power systems. With the substantial funding from BIL, we
now have an opportunity to utilize the FRA's Northeast Corridor
Project Inventory effectively. This inventory is crucial, as it
allows us to strategically prioritize projects along the NEC,
ensuring that the investments are made where they are needed
most to enhance safety, efficiency, and reliability along the
whole corridor.
As we approach reauthorization, it is vital to recognize
that NJ Transit, like commuter rail agencies nationwide,
continues to operate with substantial unfunded capital needs.
For example, while we are incredibly grateful for the passage
of BIL, this funding will not be sufficient to bridge the
nearly $5 billion gap between funded and unfunded projects in
our unconstrained $17 billion capital plan.
Reauthorization presents a critical opportunity to secure
the necessary funding to bridge this gap. For this funding to
be effective, it must be guaranteed like the funding provided
in BIL. The guaranteed advance appropriation that BIL provided
was a game-changer for the Northeast Corridor and allowed
agencies to more effectively plan their hiring, purchase
equipment, and sign contracts.
It is also essential to streamline funding mechanisms to
reduce the complexity and increase the efficiency of how
Federal funds are allocated. This also boosts confidence among
manufacturers and contractors and other stakeholders crucial to
our projects.
Infrastructure has historically been a bipartisan issue in
this country, and I am hopeful that this spirit of cooperation
will continue through the reauthorization process, enabling us
to tackle our significant capital needs head-on.
[Mr. Corbett's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Kevin S. Corbett, President and Chief Executive
Officer, New Jersey Transit, on behalf of the Northeast Corridor
Commission
Good morning, Chair Nehls, Ranking Member Payne, Vice Ranking
Member Foushee, and members of the Committee.
Thank you for inviting me to discuss the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act, or IIJA, and its impact not only on the Northeast
Corridor--which serves more than 800,000 rail passengers every day--but
on commuter railroads across the nation.
I'll be speaking today both as co-chair of the Northeast Corridor
Commission, where I serve alongside my fellow co-chair, FRA
Administrator Amit Bose, in addition to my role as President & CEO of
NJ TRANSIT--the largest statewide transit system in the country, and
the third largest overall.
I am also a co-founder of the Commuter Rail Coalition--an

PTC
As some of you may remember, I testified before this Committee in
both 2021 and 2020, where I largely covered NJ TRANSIT's experience

And, of course, there are significant and ongoing costs for the
continuing maintenance and upgrades associated with PTC--NJ TRANSIT
alone has spent more than half a billion dollars on this unfunded
mandate, and this figure continues to grow.
We continue to advocate for the creation of a more cost-effective,
unified, standardized national system across railroads throughout the
country--call it PTC 2.0.
History/``Natural Conflict''
While the implementation of PTC represents a significant step

IIJA
Speaking more broadly about funding, the IIJA has been
transformational for both commuter and inter-city rail.
Thanks to the work of Congress and the Biden Administration on the
IIJA, the NEC has its first-ever source of dedicated, multi-year
funding, providing the predictability needed to efficiently deliver a
major capital program.
This historic investment weans us off what I call the ``Transit

railroads through the IIJA, the FRA and FTA are awarding billions of
additional dollars through various discretionary competitive grants.
These grants are vitally important as we, and other transit
agencies, pursue sweeping projects that are beyond the scope of
traditional capital budgets.
Projects such as AI-powered safety systems on light rail vehicles
at grade crossings to significantly enhance safety, while reducing
accidents at light rail grade crossings and on rights-of-way and other
new investments in safety, modernization, and state-of-good-repair--to
ensure your constituents get safety and service improvements out of
every dollar they spend.
A perfect example of what transit agencies can do when given the
necessary federal resources is NJ TRANSIT's $2 billion-dollar Portal
Bridge Replacement Project, which is on time, on budget, and
50%complete, with the first track scheduled to open in 2026.

the IIJA, this funding will not be sufficient to bridge the nearly $5
billion dollar gap between funded and unfunded projects in our
unconstrained $17 billion dollar capital plan.

Conclusion
In the interests of time, I'll close with this: Multi-year,
predictable funding beyond FY26 is essential to address not just the
Northeast Corridor's state-of-good repair and improvement needs, but
the needs of commuter railroads across the nation--this includes
significant investments in fleet vehicles as well as facilities and
infrastructure.
Let me once again thank you, Chair Nehls, Ranking Member Payne,
Vice Ranking Member Foushee, and all the committee members for giving
me the opportunity to testify before you today.
I invite members of the committee to visit New Jersey to see
firsthand federal dollars at work on our Portal North Bridge project.
Now, I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Corbett.
Mr. Corbett. In the interest of time, I will close.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you, you were great, and we will have time
to ask questions, but thank you so very much for your
attention.
I would like to briefly recognize Mrs. Napolitano, who will
introduce our final witness, Mr. Kettle.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am proud to
welcome Mr. Darren Kettle, CEO of Metrolink, to our committee.
Good to see you again, sir.
Metrolink is a major transportation provider for the
residents and businesses in my district throughout southern
California.
He was appointed in 2021 as Metrolink's CEO. He has more
than 30 years of experience in effective transportation
leadership in southern California, having worked for three of
the five Metrolink member agencies, including my neighboring
San Bernardino County Transportation Authority, Riverside
County Transportation Commission, and most recently, he was
executive director of the Ventura County Transportation
Commission. He has overseen implementation of Positive Train
Control and gone beyond to ensure safety in the next generation
of locomotives.
Mr. Kettle, thank you for being here, and thank you to all
the witnesses for attending, and we look very much forward to
your testimonies.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Nehls. Mr. Kettle, you are now recognized for 5
minutes.

TESTIMONY OF DARREN M. KETTLE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL RAIL AUTHORITY (METROLINK)

Mr. Kettle. Good morning, Mr. Chair. Thank you for having
me here.
Good morning, Ranking Member Foushee. Again, my name is
Darren Kettle. I am the chief executive officer of Metrolink,
southern California's six-county commuter rail system.
As was mentioned during my introduction, I was previously
in Ventura County. I still live in Ventura County, 60 miles
from where my office is in downtown Los Angeles. I am not only
the CEO of Metrolink, I am also a customer of Metrolink. I
regularly take the train.
Metrolink was formed three decades ago by southern
California's transportation agencies, and operates on a
dedicated right-of-way, as well as with active freight lines.
Today, Metrolink has about 20,000 weekday boardings on 142
daily trains, operating on a network of 545 route-miles.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, three-quarters of our riders
held monthly passes. With today's remote and hybrid work
schedules, commuters ride less frequently, and so, commuter
railroads must change our business model to attract new riders.
Two Metrolink initiatives have proven quite successful in
boosting ridership.
The first initiative involved increasing off-peak, evening,
and weekend service frequencies. We call it Metrolink
Reimagined. It has been introduced on one of our lines that
serves Los Angeles County from Los Angeles to the Antelope
Valley, or the high desert of Los Angeles County.
The second initiative offers free fares to every student in
southern California with a .edu web address. College students
and high school students are able to take our trains for free.
Now, nothing is free. It is State grant-funded, so, we are able
to take care of our program and keep our farebox.
These two initiatives boosted our overall ridership by 27
percent on that one Metrolink line in just 4 months. And due to
this success, we are looking forward to implementing this new
schedule throughout our system.
Two historic developments hold promise to permanently
transform rail passenger service in southern California.
First, the Olympic and Paralympic Games, which will be
hosted by Los Angeles in 2028. Expected to attract 3 million
spectators, the games are designated as car-free, meaning that
parking will not be available at the venues for those sporting
events. Southern California's transit system must be prepared
for the unprecedented demand, and Metrolink will provide the
regional backbone transit service to those games from the five
urban counties of southern California.
We have shared with the administration our multiyear
funding needs, which include the operational surge in 2028 and
rolling stock, maintenance facilities, and rail improvements
throughout our system. While the Federal Government provided
crucial transportation funding for prior U.S. games, a
significant funding need still exists for the L.A. games, and
the window of opportunity to complete rail projects and
procurements is rapidly closing. We need congressional and
administrative support to realize the promise of this
transformative moment for public transit in southern California
and our Nation.
The second development is high-speed rail between Las Vegas
and southern California. The first 200-mile-per-hour train in
this country, it is Brightline West. Brightline West is
planning a groundbreaking ceremony next week to start
construction on that high-speed rail line. Metrolink presently
operates a station on the exact same footprint of where the
Brightline's last station stop will be in Rancho Cucamonga in
San Bernardino County. We have coordinated with Brightline West
to ensure that our schedules match up with theirs to ensure a
seamless connection for travelers on both systems.
By attracting those currently traveling by air or by
highway, high-speed rail can significantly boost passenger rail
use throughout southern California. My colleague, Dave Dech of
Tri-Rail, addressed the importance of private-sector partners
in efficiently delivering commuter rail service. Metrolink also
operates on a contracting business model, enabling us to
efficiently ramp up our future operations and maintenance
temporarily for L.A. 2028 and those Olympic Games, but also the
longer term connections for high-speed rail.
Finally, I would also like to echo the testimony of Debra
Johnson of the Denver Regional Transportation District, urging
that commuter rail be granted full eligibility for the CRISI
grant program currently restricted to projects that benefit
intercity and freight rail. Distinctions in Federal statute
between intercity and commuter rail appear increasingly
outmoded, and we join the Commuter Rail Coalition in urging
reform to the CRISI program.
Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Foushee, and subcommittee
members, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look
forward to working with you and your staff in delivering the
vision of transforming passenger rail service in southern
California. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[Mr. Kettle's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Darren M. Kettle, Chief Executive Officer,
Southern California Regional Rail Authority (Metrolink)
Thank you, Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Payne, and members of the
subcommittee, for the invitation to testify today on the many
opportunities and challenges facing our nation's commuter railroads. My
name is Darren Kettle, Chief Executive Officer of Metrolink in Southern
California. I appreciate the opportunity to provide Metrolink's
perspective as operator of the third-largest commuter rail system in
the country and the largest in California.
Metrolink began service in October 1992 and was established to
provide Southern California with safe, efficient, dependable rail
transportation service while offering an outstanding customer
experience, reducing emissions and fostering economic vitality by
connecting jobs and housing in a traditionally car-centric region.
Today, Metrolink is constituted as a joint powers authority under
California law and governed by an 11-member Board of Directors
representing the county transportation agencies in Los Angeles, Orange,
Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties. Metrolink's 545 route
mile system also extends into the northern portion of San Diego County.
As you know, Southern California is a region with some of the most
congested highways in the nation. The population of the six Southern
California counties served by Metrolink is now 21.5 million people,
more than half of California's total population. For those commuting to
work, Metrolink provides the freedom to live in almost any portion of
the region with the option to hop on one of our trains to get to work
or school and to travel to the region's rich entertainment and cultural
destinations. We connect multiple commercial markets, along with urban
and rural areas, to major job centers all over Southern California--the
largest of which is downtown Los Angeles where most of our lines
converge at historic Los Angeles Union Station.
Opportunities & Challenges
Transition to Regional Rail
The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally altered the commute patterns of
many of America's workers. While this has impacted all modes of transit
across the country, none more so than commuter rail. Before the
pandemic, roughly three-fourths of Metrolink's riders held 22-day
monthly passes. The size of this market has plummeted significantly.
Full-time or hybrid remote workers have forced commuter railroads to
evolve to attract new riders.
For the last 30 years, Metrolink has operated service focused on
these commuters, offering peak service in the morning to primary job
centers such as downtown Los Angeles and Orange County and then
returning in the evening, centered around traditional white-collar
office schedules. Today, remote work and hybrid work schedules remain
common, and the white-collar commuter customer group--Metrolink's
historic core market--may never fully ride in the same patterns or
frequencies as they did before the pandemic.
In early 2022, Metrolink began to work on the development of a new
optimized service plan to increase off-peak service levels and support
our transformation from a commuter rail model to a regional rail model.
We started on the path of determining how to serve a broader set of
markets such as leisure travelers and non-office commuters, while
operating more cost-effective service by optimizing crews and equipment
and operating more train miles with fewer train sets.
We have had time to observe changed travel patterns and welcome
some riders back to our system. While peak commuter period ridership
remains below pre-pandemic ridership levels, off-peak ridership has
returned more strongly. We see this on our weekend ridership and off-
peak trains; there is an unmet demand for midday service and desire for
travel across multiple lines. Presently, Metrolink operates a total of
142 trains across all our line segments that are primarily focused on
peak periods. The recommended schedule to transform our system to a
regional rail model would increase service by 36 trains, with 178 total
trains operating in the system, and would spread service across the day
and into the evening. The schedule would promote transfer opportunities
through ``pulse'' scheduling across lines, providing a more competitive
travel time when compared to driving.
We have started to implement this first phase of systemwide service
optimization starting with our Antelope Valley Line, which provides
service from northern Los Angeles County, through the San Fernando
Valley and downtown Los Angeles. In October 2023, we implemented a 58%
increase in revenue train-miles with most of the new service added
during non-commuter hours and doubling weekend service. During this
time, we also launched a pilot student pass program using funds
provided from a State of California grant program that allows all
students to ride at no cost.
For the four months following the expansion of service on the
Antelope Valley Line, total ridership increased by 27% compared to the
same period of the prior year, with students accounting for half of the
new ridership. We expect to see further increases long-term, but the
short-term results are promising. We believe that a full roll out of
optimized service with pulse scheduling and distribution of trains to
cover non-peak times will be a successful model and transform the
transportation landscape for Southern California.
In addition to the promising ridership returns of this expanded
model, we recognize there are two opportunities in the coming years
that hold the potential to provide permanent, transformative impacts to
passenger rail transportation in Southern California for the 21st
century. These are the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games, which will be
held in multiple venues throughout the Southern California region, and
the introduction of high-speed rail passenger service--the nation's
first, true high-speed service--connecting Las Vegas to Southern
California, also scheduled to commence in 2028. I would like to briefly
explain Metrolink's critical role in the success of each.
Olympics
The 2028 Olympic Games are a once in a generation opportunity to
welcome the world to the United States to celebrate our shared humanity
through sports competition. Los Angeles has hosted two successful
Olympic Games in the past, but this will be the first ``car-free''
Olympics to be held in the United States, where spectators and
participants will not be provided parking at sports venues. With an
estimated 3 million people from around the country and the world
expected to attend and support these Games, the public transit system
of the region must be improved and prepared to accommodate that
expected demand. Metrolink's service will provide the regional backbone
of public transit service, connecting people across five counties to
first and last mile connections to reach venues across Southern
California.
Building off the foundation of an optimized schedule and in
anticipation for hosting the world as part of the Olympics in 2028,
Metrolink is also preparing its entire Southern California rail network
to operate more frequent service in all directions. This effort to
improve service through capital investment is part of a more than $10
billion Metrolink capital improvement initiative called the Southern
California Optimized Rail Expansion (SCORE) program. Metrolink has
secured more than $2.5 billion in state, local and some federal funds
to improve capacity by adding new track sidings, grade crossing
improvements, station upgrades, and by revitalizing our fleet. The goal
is to improve our railroad system to accommodate two trains per hour in
both directions of travel on core lines and one train per hour on all
other lines. Such improvements are necessary to accommodate a sizable
portion of regional travel during the Games period in 2028 and to
provide a legacy for the growth of Southern California passenger rail
capacity beyond the Games. Metrolink is on track to complete a first
tier of service improvements before the Games but requires additional
funding for several key projects to round out the program of
investments. Particularly, there is a need to complete the
rehabilitation or replacement of the oldest and most polluting models
in our 55-locomotive fleet. Funds are needed to replace Tier 2
locomotives with the cleanest burning and more reliable EPA-certified
Tier 4 locomotives, which offer significant reductions in smog-
producing emissions and diesel particulates, a key public health goal
in Southern California which far too often ranks as the most polluted
air basin in the nation. We also need federal funds to enhance the
capacities of our facilities to maintain those locomotives as well as
our coach and cab car fleet. Furthermore, Metrolink seeks to secure
agreements with Class I railroads to operate passenger service more
frequently during the Games periods and explore ways to leverage that
experience to support more long-term growth.
We have identified, and shared with the Biden Administration,
Metrolink's specific multi-year funding needs for rolling stock,
maintenance and capital projects, and operational surge. These needs
include additional leased or rehabbed trainsets consisting of up to 13
locomotives and 78 railcars; expansion of our shop/yard maintenance
facilities; relocated station platforms along a key capacity chokepoint
located between Los Angeles and Anaheim, and an operational surge
supplement to ramp up for the Games. In total these costs are estimated
at $651.9 million over three fiscal years leading to the 2028 Games.
In prior U.S. Olympics, including most recently in Atlanta and Salt
Lake City, the federal government provided significant transportation
infrastructure funding to supplement local investment in providing
transportation for the Games. To date, no such investment has been made
for the 2028 Games which will be ``car-free''. The window of
opportunity to complete rail infrastructure projects and rolling stock
procurements is rapidly closing and attention to the transit needs of
the Games is needed from Congress and the Administration. While the
Games are hosted by cities worldwide, it is the national government
which typically takes the lead in providing robust transportation
funding and security coordination for the Olympic Games. It is
important that the U.S. government step up to provide this assistance
to ensure that America again provides an Olympic Games experience that
the rest of the world can aspire to, with legacy benefits to residents
and visitors for decades to come.
The benefits of investing in passenger rail are well-documented,
saving time and expense and improving safety for travelers, enhancing
economic activity while also alleviating the need for investments in
highway systems. Investment also reduces greenhouse gas emissions and
increases independence from imported fuels. According to the American
Public Transportation Association, investment in transit can yield
49,700 jobs per $1 billion invested and offers a 5 to 1 economic
return.
Brightline West
The other truly transformational passenger rail transportation
opportunity on the near-term horizon in Southern California is high
speed rail service between our region and Las Vegas. In December 2023,
the U.S. Department of Transportation awarded $3 billion in grant funds
to Brightline West to construct a privately owned and operated
electrified high-speed passenger railroad between Southern California
and Las Vegas. The fully grade-separated line will operate primarily
within the right of way along Interstate 15 between Las Vegas and
Rancho Cucamonga--where Metrolink currently operates a station. Design
coordination at the Rancho Cucamonga Station is ongoing between
Brightline West and Metrolink staff and is intended to facilitate
passenger transfers between high-speed rail and our commuter railroad
for a seamless passenger connection. We have also agreed that the
service schedule for Brightline West trains and Metrolink's San
Bernardino Line trains will be on an hourly, pulsed schedule, providing
a customer-friendly schedule that is intuitive and reliable.
I am pleased to report that our partnership with Brightline West
has been outstanding and, going forward, we believe that we will
connect our services efficiently with sufficient capacity to provide an
attractive, viable alternative to the millions of people who annually
travel between Las Vegas and Southern California by car and airplane.
The advent of this service holds the promise to truly transform
passenger rail in the region.
It also underscores another topic I would like to touch on that my
colleague, Dave Dech of Tri-Rail in Florida, addressed in his
testimony, and that is our work in partnership with the private sector.
Metrolink, like Tri-Rail, operates on a contracting business model
where most of the maintenance and operations of the railroad are
contracted with private sector partners in the rail industry. We
utilize the services of many, if not most, of the same rail industry
partners that Dave mentions in his testimony. Metrolink has operated on
this model since the beginning, and we have found that it is flexible,
efficient, and responsive to the needs of our railroad in a rapidly
evolving economy and passenger service market. A contracting model of
operations and maintenance will help us ramp up our service temporarily
in preparation for the Olympics and permanently with the advent of
high-speed rail service. We value our partnership with our private
sector partners, whether it is to help operate the railroad or
transform connectivity from our region to Las Vegas.
Retirement of Polluting Fleet
As I previously mentioned, Metrolink has made a concerted effort to
replace older, more polluting locomotives with the cleanest operating
models certified as Tier 4 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Metrolink's acquisition of 40 Tier 4 locomotives, among the largest
fleet of Tier 4s in the nation, allowed Metrolink to decommission all
its remaining Tier 0 locomotives in March 2020. This decommissioning
was required as a condition of state grant funds provided to purchase
the new Tier 4 locomotives. Older locomotives that are replaced are
required to have their engines destroyed or rendered unusable to
improve regional air quality and reduce localized impacts to
communities near maintenance facilities. However, Metrolink's
retirement of two locomotives occurred after about 18 years of service,
before the end of their useful life expectation of 25 years under
Federal Transit Administration regulation. Due to this early
retirement, Metrolink has been required to repay to the FTA the
remaining federal interest in the equipment, for a total repayment
amount of nearly $1.3 million. If the remaining Tier 2 locomotives we
are seeking funds to replace are retired, we estimate that Metrolink
will be required to repay another $3 million to $3.5 million. This FTA
repayment requirement unfairly penalizes agencies like Metrolink
seeking to replace polluting locomotives in an air basin as polluted as
Southern California's, a laudable public policy goal. We urge Congress
to require the repayment be waived when locomotives are retired earlier
than allowed by FTA regulation in a federally recognized pollutant non-
attainment air basin.
Funding--Full Eligibility for CRISI
Finally, I would like to reiterate and amplify the testimony of
Debra Johnson of the Denver Regional Transportation District regarding
full eligibility of commuter rail for the Consolidated Rail
Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) grant program. CRISI was
first authorized in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST)
Act of 2015. The program consolidated five existing FRA funding
programs into one safety and infrastructure funding source. Despite
being administered by the FRA, project eligibility is limited to
intercity and freight rail corridors, and commuter rail-specific
corridors are not eligible. Due to this limitation, much of the
Metrolink railroad network does not qualify to receive program funding.
To ensure the safety and resilience of rail corridors for regional
passenger rail service, we urge Congress to consider including full
eligibility for commuter and regional rail corridors, rolling stock
procurements, and rehabilitation to be eligible for CRISI program
funding.
Conclusion
In my role as Chief Executive Officer, I am committed to ensuring
Metrolink delivers the safest and most convenient passenger rail
service possible. With improved customer service, increased frequency
and reliability, and a paramount commitment to passenger safety,
commuter rail will become an even more compelling alternative to our
nation's most congested roadways. I invite members of this Committee to
visit us in Southern California to see Metrolink's commitment in
action.
The future for our industry depends on an integrated transportation
system that connects all modes with one another in a system that offers
a seamless experience to passengers. In our region and across the
country in metropolitan areas, this begins with commuter rail. We are
modernizing our business practices and delivering services for future
generations. To achieve these goals, we need robust federal support.
Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Payne and Subcommittee Members,
thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today. I look
forward to working with you as we deliver on the vision of
transformative commuter rail service across the nation.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mr. Kettle.
I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter
from the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association
dated April 17, 2024.
Without objection, so ordered.
[The information follows:]

Statement of Chuck Baker, President, American Short Line and Regional
Railroad Association, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Troy E. Nehls
Introduction
As president of the American Short Line and Regional Railroad
Association (ASLRRA), the trade association that represents the more
than 600 Class II and III freight railroads (commonly known as short
line railroads or short lines) and hundreds of suppliers that support
the country's short line freight rail economy, I appreciate the
opportunity to provide a statement for the record for this hearing.
The short line industry is a great American success story, and
short lines are tremendously proud of their vital role in the country's
economy and their work creating jobs in each of your states.
The topic of this hearing is the commuter rail industry, and we
recognize the important role held by our friends in the commuter rail
space. Our worlds overlap to some extent; we share some of the same
track and technology, especially in densely-populated regions where
commuter rail plays an important role in getting people to and from
work, home, school and other critical destinations--sometimes alongside
short line trains hauling important goods and freight to and from
market.
We recognize that the commuter rail industry faces numerous
economic challenges, especially after the Covid pandemic disrupted and
re-arranged once-certain commuting patterns for tens of millions of
Americans. Due to the upheaval and continuing uncertainty facing
commuter rail farebox revenue and overall financing, we understand many
commuter rail agencies are now seeking new economic lifelines. We stand
ready to work with Congress and all stakeholders in the rail space to
ensure the health of our commuter rail partners. Short line railroads,
however, also face economic headwinds due to years of deferred
maintenance that come with inheriting worn-out track and aging
structures. With surface transportation reauthorization on the horizon,
it is imperative that Congress recognize that any solution to help
commuter railroads not come at the expense of the short line freight
rail network. Congress should support the programs, policies and
resources that allow small railroads to upgrade their infrastructure to
modern standards and good condition and to serve thousands of customers
and communities in a safe, reliable, economically efficient, and
environmentally friendly manner.
The Short Line Freight Rail Industry
Short line freight railroads are a vital part of the country's rail
economy. Our members are critical links in the nation's freight supply
chain, and all are vital engines of economic activity. Together, our
members are tied to 478,000 jobs nationwide, $26.1 billion in labor
income and $56.2 billion in economic value-add--providing a service
that more than 10,000 businesses nationwide rely upon to get goods and
products to market.\1\ Short line railroads are particularly essential
to the provision of first- and last-mile service to shippers, typically
serving as the first and final link between suppliers and customers.
Our members provide this connection in many key industries critical to
our country's economic health, including the manufacturing,
agricultural, mining, energy and chemical sectors. For large areas of
rural and small-town America, short lines are the only connection to
the national rail network.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The Section 45G Tax Credit and the Economic Contribution of the
Short Line Railroad Industry, prepared by PWC for ASLRRA (2018).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short lines are an environmental success story. Just as commuter
railroads can take cars off the road, reducing greenhouse gas
emissions, short line railroads are environmental stewards. They
provide a sustainable, low-carbon freight logistics option that is more
environmentally friendly than competing forms of surface
transportation. Short line service keeps 31.8 million heavy trucks off
highways and public roads--preventing costly wear and tear on pavement,
relieving traffic congestion, cutting the emissions of harmful criteria
pollutants and reducing deadly crashes.
Short line railroads face economic challenges from inheriting old,
outdated track. As this panel knows well, the short line industry was
spurred to new life in the early 1980s when smart deregulatory action
by Congress allowed larger, Class I railroads to spin off moribund
track. Short line railroads acquired and revived these marginal lines,
turning them over time into thriving enterprises while preserving
freight rail service for thousands of customers and employees. But even
after decades of investment by short line railroads in upgrading track
and structures--often a third to 40 percent of annual revenue--the
backlog of repairs still looms large. Our industry estimates more than
$12 billion is still needed to allow short line railroads to fully
modernize and meet the country's freight needs.\2\ This number is
likely higher still, considering the hard-hitting impact of inflation
on construction costs in recent years and emergent needs for investment
by short lines in their locomotive fleets.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ PWC report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Competitive federal grants are critical for strengthening the short
line rail network. In 2015, Congress recognized the significant
rebuilding needs of the rail industry and acted, creating the
Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI)
program. Congress was aware at the time of challenges that even then
faced the commuter rail industry but nonetheless explicitly chose to
exclude them from eligibility for this program. Lawmakers limited CRISI
funding eligibility to projects on intercity passenger rail lines, such
as those operated by Amtrak, and to freight rail projects and
specifically to projects on Class II and Class III short line
railroads. The effects of this wise policy choice can be seen at short
line railroads and customers nationwide and in the short line freight
rail network. Since the first CRISI grants were awarded in 2017, short
lines have used CRISI resources to replace track and crossties, add and
extend sidings, rehabilitate bridges, improve drainage and roadbeds,
and upgrade lines to handle industry-standard 286,000-pound railcars,
ensuring national network interoperability. CRISI has allowed short
lines to provide more service, eliminate bottlenecks, and reduce
congestion--and most importantly, improve safety, as upgrading track
helps prevent the top causes of derailments on short lines: old, worn-
out rail, poor crosstie condition, and deficiencies in roadbed and
drainage. Because of the conditions faced by short lines, and the
nature of their service areas, a small CRISI investment can be
transformational to a railroad's operations and the safety and quality
of service to shippers.
Rural and urban economies have thrived because of CRISI. Fiscal
Year 2022's appropriations law brought the first full year of IIJA's
implementation and, with it, new and significant investments in short
line freight rail projects. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
selected 47 projects that were advanced by short line railroads or
short line partners. These projects are found in 36 states. All have
helped improve safety, strengthen network efficiency for shippers,
further minimize short line rail's environmental footprint, and create
new jobs. The next round of IIJA-spurred funding (covering Fiscal Years
2023 and 2024) is now available for competition. Short lines are
inspired and confident in their ongoing ability to put forward smart,
resourceful and competitive grant applications that will bolster the
country's freight rail backbone.
Ill-Conceived Efforts To Alter and Upend CRISI
CRISI's demonstrated ability to bolster the freight rail network
should be protected. Altogether, 48 states have received CRISI awards
since the program's inception. With challenges facing the commuter rail
industry--as evidenced by testimony presented for this hearing--some
are proposing a dramatic undoing of the successful path forged by
CRISI. Some have suggested expanding eligibility within CRISI to allow
funding for commuter rail projects. Any such effort to loosen or expand
CRISI to include a whole other sector of rail would be a dire and
drastic mistake. CRISI is the only competitive grant program for which
short line railroads are directly eligible. Despite the continued
strength and quality of short line projects, adding another mouth--or
dozens of them--at the table could swallow the entire program. This
would snuff out small railroad projects, despite the continued strength
and quality of short line projects. Throwing out the current structure
in favor of commuter rail would counter well-thought, deliberative
Congressional intent reflected in two successive surface transportation
reauthorization bills (both the FAST Act and IIJA) to use CRISI to help
rebuild our freight rail network instead of focusing on regional
commuter rail programs. This uncertainty and upheaval could be
calamitous to the short line freight rail ecosystem.
Vast resources are already available to commuter railroads.
Congress has already wisely provided for commuter rail in substantial,
well-established, and dedicated funding programs. Commuter railroads
can avail themselves of many large-scale competitive grant programs
provided with massive funds by IIJA. For instance, commuter entities
are eligible for department-wide competitive grant programs, like Mega
and RAISE, and programs through the Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) like the Capital Investment Grants (CIG) program. Commuter
railroads are recipients of funding from major pots of formula funds,
like the impressively funded Urbanized Area Formula Grants program.
Commuter railroads that share lines with intercity passenger rail--
especially those along the Northeast Corridor (NEC)--can and have
benefited in recent years from the enormously funded new programs in
IIJA to expand passenger rail service. Commuter railroads can also
avail themselves of Congressionally directed spending unavailable to
most short lines. Commuter properties are eligible for major federal
loan programs like TIFIA and RRIF and have state, local and farebox
revenue, too. Lastly, those seeking to throw out CRISI in favor of a
new, untested framework are doing so on the heels of massive infusion
of resources in several Covid relief packages in 2020 and 2021.
Congress should consider the creation of new resources and
programs, not raiding existing ones. If current resources are
insufficient and Congress wants to explore new pathways for investing
in commuter rail, we will not stand in the way of such a worthwhile
discussion. Many commuter rail operating models are facing new economic
pressures and significant reductions and changes in demand for their
services. This is not a challenge to be addressed by attempting to
temporarily paper over the situation with CRISI funds. In practice,
this funding is not necessarily being sought for capital purposes, but
rather to provide financial flexibility to try to fill in unexpected
operating deficits. Lawmakers should carefully evaluate how to use or
bolster the existing tools they have in the established transit funding
toolkit. Congress needs to determine, with a long-term view, the
federal objectives that are realistic and appropriate to be attained
with federal resources in the commuter rail space given changed
circumstances in recent years.
Short line railroads do not seek to deplete commuter rail
resources. We in the short line rail community are currently urging
Congress to consider authorizing new resources for small railroads
impacted by an increasingly devastating number of natural disasters. We
appreciate the robust bipartisanship evidenced by the members of this
panel who have endorsed important legislation proposed by Rep. Byron
Donalds (R-FL), the Short Line Railroad Relief Act (H.R. 3782), now
before the committee. An authorization for commuter and transit
entities to receive emergency funds already exists and has been used to
provide tens of millions of dollars for commuter rail agencies, which
we do not question nor want to change. We encourage our friends in the
commuter space, rather, to consider modeling their effort on ours--
seeking new authorization and appropriations as necessary instead of
upending current successful and time-tested USDOT endeavors.
Finally, more resources will be needed by short lines to face new
challenges since CRISI's creation. Earlier this year, a new rule went
on the books in California that threatens to impose drastic new
financial obligations on short line railroads. The agency implementing
the rule, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), even admits some
short lines ``would be eliminated'' due to ``the costs of the Proposed
Regulation'' (emphasis added).\3\ Should this rule stand (and even
worse proliferate nationwide) and California be granted the
inappropriate authorization that it has requested from the EPA, short
lines would require ever more resources to ensure they can make
unexpected, massive investments in locomotives, while simply trying to
keep their business afloat. We calculate that this rule could force
California short lines to try to make nearly half a billion dollars in
motive power fleet investments over only a few years. That would be a
step change by multiple orders of magnitude above historical short line
locomotive capital investment levels. We expect the next round of the
CRISI program will see several applications for funding for locomotive
projects from California short lines as they attempt to respond to this
huge and problematic unfunded mandate. Having more entities eligible to
receive CRISI moneys, such as commuter rail, could push already
endangered short lines in California--and those states that could mimic
California's emissions rule--ever close to the brink of bankruptcy.

Conclusion
ASLRRA appreciates the committee's close attention to the items we
have noted in our statement, and we welcome future opportunities to
work together on these matters.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you all for being here and your testimony.
We will now turn to questions from the panel, and I will
recognize myself for 5 minutes.
First question, Mr. Noland, Amtrak asserts that it has a
right of track preference over the commuter lines. How does
Amtrak's use of commuter lines impact commuter rail services?
Mr. Noland. Well, if we have built, which we just did, a
$650 million project to really build up our own commuter
system, we have got schedules that are based upon the
infrastructure we have built, we also have a freight partner
that uses that line. If Amtrak shifts their current service
onto our line, that will use up capacity.
And so, we need to have the ability to have a fair arm's-
length negotiation if Amtrak is going to come to our line and
not simply--and they have not said this, but they have the
power to say, ``Thank you for negotiating, but we have the
right to enter your line. And if we do come on your line, all
we have to pay you is the incremental cost to be there.'' For
us, that seems to be an inequitable circumstance, and we would
suggest that that needs to be balanced with fair and reasonable
adjudication if we can't reach an agreement.
Mr. Nehls. Sure. Mr. Corbett, do you have any thoughts?
Mr. Corbett. Yes. I think, for us, we have a good
relationship with Amtrak, but that Amtrak preference does
have--if there is a train coming hours late on Amtrak, for us,
we are operating 20-plus trains on the Northeast Corridor,
particularly at rush hour, so, we have to wait until that train
comes through. That can hold up 1,000 people on each one of our
trains.
I think the key for us is to be part of the dispatching. We
can live with Amtrak preference if we are part of the
dispatching, which currently we are not.
Mr. Nehls. Sure. And Mr. Noland, at a recent subcommittee
hearing, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy expressed the need to
eliminate the redtape and better communicate with communities
to improve grade crossing safety. How might FRA improve
communication and streamline the application process and grant
distribution with regards to the Rail Crossing Elimination
program?
Mr. Noland. Well, I think everybody on this panel would
agree that wherever we can eliminate a grade crossing, that is
a good result.
We talked about Positive Train Control. It is a great
system. We invested $4 billion-plus into it. It saves lives, it
makes a safer system. But if we collectively look at the
injuries and deaths at grade crossings across the country, it
pales in comparison to what PTC is doing for us. So, we are big
advocates, and anything that we can do to make access to those
funds simpler and easier, we support that.
Mr. Nehls. I agree with that, and that is where the lives
are lost, the injuries are taking place. I think there is about
$500 million, if I am correct, in that program. I believe that
there should be more robust funding into that area, without
question.
Ms. Johnson, RTD-Denver has applied for Federal loans and
grants for rail improvement projects in the past. What has been
RTD-Denver's experience in these application processes?
Ms. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our experience has
been one that has been slightly cumbersome in the sense of
trying to understand fully the rules of engagement. We have
leveraged opportunities by partnering with other jurisdictions
when we have taken advantage of the opportunities to
rehabilitate our Denver Union Station nearly 12 years ago.
And so, as we go forward, basically understanding more in a
straightforward manner would be advantageous for us to take
advantage of programs more holistically.
Mr. Nehls. Yes. This one here, I guess, again for Mr.
Noland, but anybody can.
You touch upon it in your opening statement. We talked
about the issues commuter rail faces with regard to the excess
liability insurance and the 30-day window to obtain the
insurance. You are asking for that 1 year, that 365. Do you
want to just add a little bit more, and then maybe we have a
second or two for some of the others?
So, if you want to, Mr. Noland, if you want to touch upon
it one more time, or----
Mr. Noland [interrupting]. Sure. The excess liability
insurance market is all foreign. So, we are not buying here in
the United States. This is not Buy America. We are going to
London, and we are going to Bermuda.
The prices have skyrocketed, and the market capacity is
shrinking. And I think anybody who has followed the news has
seen that in homeowners or car situations, the insurance is
getting more costly and less available. And we are seeing that
in the excess insurance market. There is approximately $400
million of rail excess market available worldwide. And when the
act is adjusted, when the amount in the cap goes up, we are
going to have difficulty placing that coverage.
Mr. Nehls. Mr. Kettle, do you have any comments on that, or
any point?
Mr. Kettle. I would just echo what Mr. Noland said. When
the increase occurs in 2026, that is when we get real anxious.
For now we are stable; 2026 is an entirely different question.
Mr. Nehls. Yes, it has my attention. And hopefully the
members of this subcommittee, we are going to continue to look
into that, because you should be able to buy that insurance
here someplace in the United States.
All right, I will now recognize Mrs. Foushee for 5 minutes.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you again
to the witnesses for your testimonies today. This question is
for any or all of you: Do your contract partners work with rail
unions?
Mr. Dech. So, I can address that. Yes, our outside
contractor in south Florida, we do deal with the--we are
organized labor both on the transportation dispatching and on
the maintenance of equipment side, as well as maintenance of
way. So, yes, ma'am.
Ms. Johnson. Mrs. Foushee, Debra Johnson, once again. We
are part of a concessionaire agreement. And in reference to the
employees that they have, their signalmen are unionized, but
the conductors and engineers are not.
Mr. Noland. On the South Shore Line, we directly provide
service. We have 300-plus employees who are with five different
national rail unions. We are right now in negotiations, so, we
are no different, really, than a Class I or other commuter
properties that directly provide service. So, yes, we have
union employees.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you. The next question is for Mr.
Corbett.
Mr. Corbett. For us we have 12,000 employees, 10,000 which
are unionized overall. Our rail is fully unionized directly for
us. Our light rail is contracted out, but they are also fully
unionized.
Mr. Kettle. And just lastly--again, Darren Kettle, CEO of
Metrolink--our engineers and conductors are Amtrak contractors.
And in that fashion, they are represented.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you. The next question is for Mr.
Corbett.
Should other regions of the country have similar regional
commissions to the Northeast Corridor Commission?
And if so, what would be the benefits of that?
Mr. Corbett. Thank you. I think we have seen it be very
beneficial. It has been a growth curve, a learning curve since
the commission was created, but we really see that now,
particularly with the funding, we are able to prioritize and
cooperate and work collaboratively with Amtrak.
Sometimes there is a tension. When it was all the
Pennsylvania Railroad, intercity and commuter rail even within
one company, that is a natural tension. But we worked that out.
And I think the success and the progress we have made at the
Northeast Corridor Commission would be a good role model for
some other regions, as well, yes.
Mrs. Foushee. Mr. Dech, do you think the flexibility in the
Senate version of the Railway Safety Act that allows railroads
to submit a plan to the Federal Railroad Administration for
alternate technology options for hot box detectors gets to your
concern on what alternative technologies there might be to hot
box detectors?
Mr. Dech. I think that is a good start. There are
technologies out that are available that, like, I personally--
our agency isn't big enough to kind of leverage those--put that
R&D in. But I know some of the Class I's have been dabbling for
quite some time. And I know there is some grant money out there
for research and development because there are ways that we can
leverage different technology, even existing technologies such
as using fiber optic lines that are along the railroads.
With advances in machine learning, you have the possibility
to map the acoustic footprint of what is a healthy bearing. So,
over time, with enough research, you should be able to map that
out and then be able to pick out an overheating or
malfunctioning bearing, which would be far more effective than
waiting every 10, 15, 20 miles.
Mrs. Foushee. In a March 2023 press release, the
Association of American Railroads stated that they would
immediately install 1,000 additional hot box detectors every 15
miles. What are your thoughts on why they would say that if the
technology is obsolete?
Mr. Dech. The technology is there. It is a sure-fire way to
add a layer of protection. I think that it is a small market.
I am a supporter of the wayside defect detectors. I
installed them in Austin when we didn't have any. We have
upgraded our defect detectors here. I worry about the supply
chain and being able to fulfill those orders, which I think
will affect the cost for all of us, which is, I think, why we
need to look at some alternatives.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize Mr. Kean
for 5 minutes.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want
to thank our witnesses for being here today. I would especially
like to thank Mr. Kevin Corbett, president and CEO of New
Jersey Transit, for traveling south to inform us of the
challenges faced by New Jersey Transit, and also the critical
work they do for the great State of New Jersey.
Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing, as it is
critical for my constituents in the Seventh Congressional
District of New Jersey, which relies heavily on commuter rail
on a daily basis. May that be for commuting eastward into New
York City in the morning, or commuting westward in the
afternoon, or reverse on those routes in the morning and the
evening; the ability to catch a children's sporting event or
other activities; or to access dinner with their families and
on a timely basis, having an efficient rail system is vital for
that to happen. It needs to be predictable commutes, and it
needs to be as easy as humanly possible.
New Jersey Transit is operating efficiently, is vital for
all New Jerseyans. As Mr. Corbett knows, my constituents are
enthusiastic about the Hunter Flyover. It basically constructs
a flyover south of Newark Penn Station to eliminate at-grade
crossings and to reduce conflict between trains, and increases
capacity for New Jersey Transit and for Amtrak alike, enabling
New Jersey Transit to improve Raritan Valley Line service. That
is why I introduced, and this committee and the whole House has
passed, the One Seat Ride Act, which directs the Secretary of
Transportation to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of a one-seat
ride trip versus a transfer trip option during peak hours on
New Jersey Transit's Raritan Valley Line.
This committee and this House should recognize the immense
benefits commuter rail has for the State of New Jersey and the
Northeast Corridor, but also the future benefits to the entire
Nation.
Mr. Corbett, as I know, you are extensively familiar with
the Gateway Project and its benefits not only to New Jersey,
but to the entire region and to the country. Additionally, I
know we have spoken many times regarding the need for a one-
seat ride option on the Raritan Valley Line before the
completion of the overall Gateway Project. As you know, I
worked with one of your predecessors over a decade ago to
secure the first-ever off-peak option for Raritan Valley Line
commuters.
A key part of having a full-time redundant system
throughout New Jersey and throughout the region is making the
Hunter Flyover as a reality. In September of last year, it was
announced that FHWA awarded an additional $425 million in
Federal transportation dollars to NJDOT as part of the Federal
August redistribution process. I know that funding is key for
completion of the Hunter Flyover. Is New Jersey DOT allocating
any of these funds for this project?
And what is currently the status of the Hunter Flyover
completion?
Mr. Corbett. Thank you, Congressman, and thank you for all
your efforts on behalf of New Jersey Transit and for our
regional and national economy in that context.
Hunter Flyover, as you know, a one-seat ride and a smooth
transition, the flex funds that we get from FHWA do not have
that flexibility to cover a Hunter Flyover, because that is
just a pure rail bridge. We did put in for a RAISE grant for
it, a competitive RAISE grant, but that did not make the cut
for a RAISE, and I think that is one of the reasons we are
looking at CRISI, because this would be a kind of bridge that
would be perfect for CRISI. It will improve both Amtrak--
instead of going for a ladder cutting across the Northeast
Corridor, it will bring the Raritan Valley Line over and tie in
right into the corridor smoothly, not disrupting Amtrak or our
Northeast Corridor trains, but be able to tie right in. So, it
is a critical piece of infrastructure.
But that is the challenge. We are in the preliminary design
work for that. But to get the funding to really go to full
design and contracting, we need to--we do not have that
funding. So, that is a critical issue, and that is one of the
things we would like to see--
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. And the--as you know, the one-seat
ride on the Raritan Valley Line can be completed long before
the Gateway Project is completed.
Mr. Corbett. Yes.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. It is vital to my constituents and
needs to be prioritized.
As you mentioned in your testimony, there is always a
natural conflict that exists between New Jersey Transit and
Amtrak. But what are these conflicts? You said they were
managed with strategic collaboration. Specifically, what are
the most common areas of conflict between New Jersey Transit
and Amtrak operations, and how are they usually resolved?
Mr. Corbett. Well, I think, for the purpose of--regarding
the BIL, I think the money that we spend on projects, things
like Elizabeth Station, if they are projects that are
beneficial to us but not necessarily a priority for Amtrak, the
workforce availability has been the biggest cause of delays and
cost overruns when they are not able to provide protection.
And I think one of the things we have done for the
Northeast Corridor as this money is coming in to allow these
projects to move ahead quicker is, for projects where Amtrak
cannot supply their workforce in a timely manner, is for us--we
are doing a pilot program right now for County Yard/Delco Lead
project, where we will do the flagging because it is for our
benefit. Our flaggers we properly trained so that we can do
that, which will free up Amtrak's labor force to be able to
work where they do have their limited resources as they ramp
up. They are adding a lot, but right now they struggle to
provide adequate flagging up and down the corridor.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Perfect. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize a very
valued member of this subcommittee, Mr. Moulton, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Moulton. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. It is an
honor to be here with all of you.
Mr. Chairman, you talked about how more people are working
remotely. We heard that from a number of our witnesses. My
estimation is that this will delay some of the ridership goals
that were laid out before the pandemic, but not ultimately
reduce them. And I was going to brag about how, as of February,
Boston commuter rail ridership had reached 96 percent of
prepandemic levels, but Mr. Dech has already surpassed
prepandemic ridership.
So, congratulations, and I won't pat ourselves on the back
for that.
But the bottom line is that commuter rail systems need to
modernize. In Massachusetts, we are talking about converting
from a commuter rail system to simply taking people in and out
of the city to a regional rail system that will fundamentally
get people around the Commonwealth faster. That's when they are
valuable, if they can get you around faster.
Now, when we have highway hearings, we often talk about EVs
and self-driving vehicles, but most of the clips from this
hearing could be from 1949, because we are fundamentally
talking about technology that is 75 years out of date. Ranking
Member Larsen talked about the contributions of the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law to intercity rail services like Sound
Transit, which, like my MBTA Commuter Rail in Boston, operate
with essentially 1950s technology at 1900s speeds.
By the way, not 1920 speeds, because by 1920, most speeds
were faster. And if you compare commuter rail timetables from
1920 to today, they are mostly faster in 1920. That's pathetic.
Vice Ranking Member Foushee talked about intercity
passenger rail in North Carolina, a great investment. But the
reality is that ridership estimates for this new system are
very low compared to highway or air traffic numbers for one
clear reason: they are too slow.
I am grateful for Mr. Yakym, actually, because he was, I
think, the only Member to discuss actually increasing speeds,
which Mr. Noland is accomplishing on his system.
And, Mr. Kettle, thank you very much for talking about the
importance of high-speed rail, even though there was no
dedicated high-speed rail funding in the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law.
So, one question I have for all of you is, what are you
doing to actually increase speeds to attract riders, because
you can get people faster where they need to go?
There is a 1947 rule that limits speeds to 79 miles per
hour without automatic train stop, based on a crash in 1946.
Where are we with PTC? We have PTC. How many of you are
petitioning to increase speeds on your lines, now that you have
adopted PTC?
I am going to take that for the record, because we have
limited time, but I would very much appreciate your responses.
We also talked a bit about the Senate bill for more hot box
detectors. Hot box detectors are 1960s technology. And sure, we
can put more of them--we could put one every 5 feet, and it
would reduce but never eliminate crashes. Whereas, if you had
onboard technology to actually measure the bearing temperatures
in real time, just like we have onboard technology that we
wear, wearable technology all around, you could actually
eliminate accidents. That should be the focus of our committee:
modernizing.
And so, the big question is, OK, so, why are we so behind?
Why is this? Well, there are a number of reasons, but there is
none bigger than funding. And Mr. Corbett, you talked about
historical underinvestment, decades of subsidizing highways and
driving and airports and airlines. But while we celebrate $100
million for Metra commuter cars in Chicago, you couldn't build
a single highway interchange for that kind of money. We are
talking about PTC here at the same time as we are talking about
next-generation air traffic control. There is one big
difference. Congress pays for it, for the air system, but it is
forcing private railways to pay for the rail system.
Now, we also talk here about increasing fare revenues, but
we never talk about doing that with driving, to actually make
people who drive pay the cost. So, I asked for a study in
Massachusetts to examine the cost of driving. Conclusion: $64
billion annually to the Commonwealth, just in the small State
of Massachusetts. That is $14,000 per person that they are
paying with their tax dollars to subsidize people who drive.
Even if you don't own a car, even if you don't own a car, that
is what we are paying to subsidize driving.
And instead, the MBTA system in Massachusetts is estimated
to save about $15 billion a year because of increased--I'm
sorry, that is just in terms of the highway that we don't have
to build, and the 3,000 acres of parking spaces we don't
require. It also has $11.4 billion in annual economic benefit.
If you look at Massachusetts in terms of airports, it is
the same thing. Terminal E just got a $700 million expansion.
If you look at the number of passengers it will serve, that is
about $130 per passenger investment at the same time we are
repairing the Orange Line with an investment of $3.13 per
passenger.
So, the bottom line is that I am a big fan of America, but
I am not a big fan of our commuter rail systems. We need to
modernize. We need to catch up with the rest of the world. And
what this committee should be doing is pushing commuter rail
systems to move forward. I hope we can accomplish that with
you.
And Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. Mr. Moulton, I appreciate your insight. I now
recognize Mr. Yakym for 5 minutes.
Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Noland, we have talked both about the transformational
impact that the $650 million double track project will have on
the South Shore in our local economy. From an initial concept
to next month's groundbreaking, how long has it taken for the
double track project to come to fruition from concept all the
way through to completion?
Mr. Noland. Well, Samuel Insull thought about it 100 years
ago, but 10 years ago, our board passed a strategic plan. We
started the engineering in 2016. So, from the time we went out
with preliminary engineering and environmental to finishing up
the punch list, which we are doing today, is 8 years.
Mr. Yakym. And there has been a lot of work over the course
of the last 8 years. Is that fair to say?
Mr. Noland. That is fair to say.
Mr. Yakym. Can you briefly walk through how the financing
of this project came together?
Mr. Noland. Well, we have financing from a lot of different
sources: four counties that we operate in each contributed
$18.25 million towards the funding. In two of the counties, it
was split between the county government and the city of South
Bend and St. Joe County, as you know, and $12 million from
Michigan City and the other $6 million from LaPorte County.
We also received funding from the State of Indiana,
tremendous funding from the State. I mentioned Governor Holcomb
is our major champion there. We appreciate that.
And then we went out and received funding from the Capital
Investment Grant process. We have a full funding grant
agreement with the FTA for the balance of our funding.
Mr. Yakym. So, many sources of funding over the course of
the last 8 years to come up with the $650 million.
Mr. Noland. Correct.
Mr. Yakym. So, you and the South Shore Line put in a lot of
blood, sweat, and tears over the last, call it now 10 years
almost, to put together the funding, the contractors, and
everything else to make this double track a reality, which we
are going to open next month. Yet, as I understand it, Amtrak,
which doesn't currently operate on South Shore's track, is
considering essentially inviting itself onto the double track.
Is that correct?
Mr. Noland. Amtrak currently runs parallel to us on the
Norfolk Southern. They have historically indicated they have
issues with their on-time performance and capacity, and I think
they see the opportunity to use the significantly improved
right-of-way. And so, we have had conversations with them, and
they have indicated they would like to strongly consider moving
their operations over to our line.
Mr. Yakym. And if they do that, you would have very little
bargaining power over Amtrak's compensation to you, and it
would be essentially Amtrak that tells you what it believes is
going to be a fair rate for them to come onto your tracks. Is
that correct under current Federal law?
Mr. Noland. Absent an across-the-table negotiation at arm's
length, Amtrak does have the statutory power to come on our
service and only pay incremental cost.
Mr. Yakym. Did Amtrak contribute any money or other
nonmonetary support for the double track project?
Mr. Noland. No, sir.
Mr. Yakym. Mr. Chairman, I hope that we can watch this
space very, very closely. And I will say I have had a very good
dialogue with the CEO of Amtrak, Stephen Gardner in this
hearing room, but also in private in my office. And I want to
make sure that, if Amtrak does go this route, it does so only
after it follows through on its promise and commitment of close
consultation and adequate compensation for the South Shore Line
and the double track project.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, again, for holding this hearing
today, and I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mrs.
Napolitano for 5 minutes.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A question for
Mr. Kettle.
With 500-plus route-miles serving more than 20 million
people, how does Metrolink prioritize investments in
infrastructure or programs that increase access to its service
for underserved communities?
Mr. Kettle. Thank you, Congresswoman. So, as you said, we
service a large market, southern California, 20 million people.
Many of the lines that we operate on originally were freight
railroad lines, and they go through a number of disadvantaged
communities throughout southern California, including your
district, but all over southern California, where we have
residents of lower incomes.
We have established a couple of different programs. One
that we are quite proud of is a program that allows for any
individual with a EBT card to get 50 percent discounts on the
ability to ride our trains, regardless of age. We also have
programs for active military and seniors. And of course, I
mentioned during my opening remarks our ``students ride free''
program that has been tremendously successful across the
region.
As I have said, I ride the train, I see the students, I see
what it is doing to change their lives, and it is growing our
ridership. So, it is a win-win.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you. You mentioned a concerted
effort to replace older, more polluting locomotives with a
cleaner model. Why does Metrolink need to add cleaner burning
diesel locomotives to its fleet?
How many do you have now?
What impact will these newer locomotives have on southern
California?
How many is the agency seeking to purchase?
Mr. Kettle. Our current fleet is a fleet of 55 locomotives;
40 of those are virtually brandnew, Tier 4 locomotives, the
cleanest burning diesel locomotives in the country.
I don't think anybody will question that southern
California has historically had a real challenge when it comes
to air quality. So, it would be irresponsible for us if we
didn't make best efforts to make sure that entire fleet of 55
is the cleanest burning diesel engines you can find. Our goal
is to get to 53 of our 55 to be Tier 4 locomotives. Again, the
oldest ones we have were only introduced into our fleet in
2017, so, they are brandnew.
And then we are going to be testing the market of zero-
emission push-pull locomotives. We received a regional grant
most recently in the amount of $60 million for us to start
looking at exploring zero-emission push-pull locomotives. It
would be the first demonstration of that type of technology in
the country.
And I should mention real quickly we will also be launching
our hydrogen fuel cell multiple unit in the region where we
have some of the dirtiest air in San Bernardino County, between
San Bernardino and Redlands. It will be the first zero-
emission, multiple unit, hydrogen fueled in revenue service in
the United States.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you. California, as in other States,
has a severe housing shortage. How does Metrolink service help
connect people living in more affordable areas of the region
get to their employment centers?
Mr. Kettle. Again, we live in a vast region. Some of our
trips are 70 or 80 miles because that is where the affordable
housing is, whether you work in Orange County or Los Angeles
County, and our trains get there.
We have started working with homebuilders to provide
incentive programs. As new homeowners are purchasing homes in
outlying areas that are more affordable, we are working with
homebuilders to develop programs that get people onto our
trains so they know that the commuter rail system in southern
California can be an option for them besides driving a car.
Mrs. Napolitano. Great. Would you explain a little bit of
what you have done with the Positive Train Control to better
the service?
Mr. Kettle. Positive Train Control, along with all of my
colleagues, it has been something that we have pursued. We were
the first to actually have it in the country in southern
California.
What we have learned with PTC, though, is that it is all
about safety, but we are finding value added in PTC. Most
recently, we have been able to connect Positive Train Control
to ShakeAlert. Everybody knows southern California has an
occasional earthquake. So, now we are set up to the point where
ShakeAlert, through PTC, alerts our engineers. Depending on the
severity of the earthquake, it may entirely shut down that
train if it is within a certain radius of where the earthquake
occurs, or it may simply tell an engineer that an earthquake
has occurred, you need to slow your train or stop it.
So, we are taking the opportunity of this safety
technology, and taking it to a whole other level.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you very much.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize Mr.
Stauber for 5 minutes.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I know we are discussing
commuter rail today. However, I want to discuss crime.
And crime is happening on all modes of public
transportation: buses, transit rail, commuter rail, you name
it. It wasn't always this way, but Minnesota has changed with
our current Governor at the helm. It is now known for leniency
for criminal behavior. There is no better proof than the Metro
Transit in Minneapolis.
Let's start with the ``party car.'' On the three-car light
rail, operators never enter the middle car when the light rail
switches directions. This was quickly noticed by a certain
crowd. The middle car now attracts riders who are more likely
to smoke or break rules, so much that it is conversationally
known as the ``party car,'' that middle car.
So, instead of cracking down on the bad behavior, however,
the Democrats in Minnesota, they took a different approach.
Fare violations are now a petty misdemeanor, a $35 ticket
instead of a $180 misdemeanor charge, and they have replaced
police officers with Transit Rider Investment Program, TRIP,
agents: nonpolice agents who are to ``remind'' criminals of
their behavior. Now it has become so bad that they are
considering reducing the size of the trains, rolling out a two-
car train instead. Instead of punishing the criminals, our
State would rather punish our good citizens who are just trying
to get to or from work.
To our witnesses, I know Minneapolis is not alone in the
fight against crime, but it is clear our State leaders are lost
on this issue. What have your commuter transportation systems
done to ensure the safety of your passengers?
Mr. Kettle.
Mr. Kettle. Thank you, Congressman. As I mentioned in my
earlier remarks, I am a user of our system. I ride the train, I
am a customer. I see what our customers see on a daily basis.
What we have addressed on our system--and generally
speaking, across the country, commuter rails are considered
relatively safe in the transit sector. But that is not enough.
We have Los Angeles County sheriff deputies that ride our
trains regularly. My chief of safety, security, and compliance
ensures that we have strong metrics that then--yes, sir.
Mr. Stauber. So, Mr. Kettle, I appreciate that.
Specifically, if I am on one of your trains, something happens
to me, will there be a sheriff's deputy there?
Mr. Kettle. We do not have sheriff deputies on every train,
no. We target----
Mr. Stauber [interrupting]. OK. So, in that case, Mr.
Kettle, somebody assaults me or one of my children. What do I
do?
Mr. Kettle. On our trains, we make sure there--first of
all, we have conductors on all of our trains that have
immediate access to our security operations center. If
something occurs, our conductors immediately call that into
security.
Mr. Stauber. What is the timeframe?
Mr. Kettle. Well, in a 545-mile system, and sheriff
deputies spread throughout, it can take a couple of train
stations before our sheriff is able to be on our trains.
Mr. Stauber. OK. Mr. Corbett, how about you?
Mr. Corbett. Yes----
Mr. Stauber [interrupting]. If somebody is being assaulted,
tell me the pace at which they could get immediate help.
Mr. Corbett. Congressman, also, we have our own police
force, an extremely proud police force. We do deal with
counterterrorism with the New York-Philadelphia market, so, we
have a lot of experience.
Mr. Stauber. Yes.
Mr. Corbett. We also deal with--you see more drug-related
crimes----
Mr. Stauber [interrupting]. Do you have law enforcement on
every train, in case----
Mr. Corbett [interrupting]. We don't put them on every
train, similar--but what we do have is the next station--we
tell our crews generally not to get involved with the assault,
but we put through legislation we just got passed in New Jersey
2 years ago that allows us to--if you are in assault, we
protect certainly our train crews so that it--we don't have
to--through the court system, that it is--raised it as a
felony. So, it is a serious felony, so, we do that. And then we
are able to ban them from riding the system.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you, Mr. Corbett, thank you.
Mr. Noland, how about you?
Mr. Noland. We have our own police force, but it is not a
large police force, and we are over 90 miles. Our conductors
are trained that if there is an incident on a train, to
immediately get a hold of dispatch, who will get a hold of our
police department. And if they can't be there in a timely
fashion, we work with our local municipalities very
cooperatively so that at the next available train stop we can
handle that situation.
Mr. Stauber. In any of your equations, are you expecting
other commuters to jump in and help?
Voice. No, we are not.
Mr. Stauber. OK.
Ms. Johnson, how about you?
Ms. Johnson. We have a sworn police department. Our second
crewmember actually is contracted out on our concessionaire
agreement platform, and they are armed. And we also have a
transit ride app. If somebody were to see something, they can
say something, and then we will deploy additional support.
Mr. Stauber. Is there law enforcement on every train?
Ms. Johnson. Not sworn, certified police officers, but
armed security.
Mr. Stauber. OK. With no arrest powers, or----
Ms. Johnson [interrupting]. No arrest powers.
Mr. Stauber. Got it. Mr. Dech, you are the last one. I've
got 10 seconds left.
Mr. Dech. We have armed security on our trains, as well as
at our stations. We do randomize those processes. We have
conductors on every train that have access to our PSCC, and we
work very closely with our counties and municipalities for
police to have arrest powers.
Mr. Stauber. Yes, I just--real briefly, Mr. Chair, if you
would indulge me for a minute. The reason I am asking this is,
you talk about safety as your priority. If I am on your 90-mile
train, 45 miles into it, and I get assaulted, or my children or
my wife, the expectation is there will be help as soon as
practical. You are talking 25 or 30 minutes. The assault is
over, the damage is done.
And so, as a former police officer, I know getting there
quicker--and I think you all would agree with this. I
understand the practicality of it. But you know what? I think
that more people would feel comfortable and probably more
ridership if that were to happen, if they saw law enforcement
there with arrest powers. That is a deterrent.
I thank you very much for indulging me, Mr. Chair. Thank
you.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr. Garcia
for 5 minutes.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking
Member, and to all of our witnesses.
As you have heard, a commuter rail is a lifeline for many
people who rely on it for affordable, convenient ways to get to
work, school, and anywhere else they want to go.
With the upcoming surface transportation reauthorization
bill, there are ample opportunities to address some of the
challenges for commuter rail. One such challenge is the
challenge in ridership levels and patterns that has shifted
since the COVID pandemic.
Mr. Noland, I understand that NICTD is building a second
set of tracks between Michigan City and Gary, Indiana, which is
expected to bring more ridership to Chicago, as well. I welcome
that. Amidst a new ridership landscape, what factors went into
deciding to build additional tracks on this route?
And how is NICTD evaluating what projects to fund, based on
the change in ridership?
Mr. Noland. Thank you, Mr. Congressman. The section is a
26-mile section that was largely single track. And Congressman
Moulton mentioned that we are an older technology, and we need
to look at ways to improve our service.
So, one of the things that we have looked at was areas
where we have congestion. We had congestion in that area. By
adding a second track with high-speed crossovers, we are able
to add more express service, reduce our time to and from
Chicago, and that drives ridership. Better performance is an
opportunity to drive ridership.
We are also going to add trains to the off-peak evening and
weekend services so that we are not just that rush hour--that
traditional rush hour--that 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. worker is not
there anymore. We need to service the midday folks, as well.
So, those two things, reducing the time to Chicago and back
and offering the services off peak are huge for us.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Great, thank you.
Another pressing issue for commuter rail and the rail
industry writ large is the lack of regulation around locomotive
emission standards. As of 2016, nearly 50 percent of existing
locomotive emissions were uncontrolled, with no standards for
any pollutants. Mr. Kettle, why has the rail industry, in your
opinion, been so slow to cut emissions, despite the fact that
cleaner engines exist?
Mr. Kettle. Congressman, I think, again, in our system, we
have gone all-in as it relates to finding the cleanest burning
technology utilizing diesel locomotives. Again, we use
renewable fuel. We do not use petroleum diesel.
I think it is a combination of factors I think you are
seeing throughout the country. Commuter railroads are shifting
to cleaner burning, Tier 4 locomotives. We certainly are
committed to that, with a long-term future of getting to zero
emission.
And I think it is a byproduct of just the nature of the
cost of equipment. When you buy a locomotive, you are going to
have that locomotive for 30 years, and I think it takes time
for that public investment to be fully absorbed, at which point
I think other agencies across the country will look towards
cleaner burning equipment.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Well, thank you for that answer.
And just following up on it, the people most harmed by
pollution from these emissions are rail workers and communities
around those railroads, communities like my district, which has
some of the worst air quality in the country. What can we do at
a Federal level to speed up the transition to Tier 4 or zero-
emissions engines?
Mr. Kettle. It really does boil down, Congressman, to
funding. And you have heard my colleagues talk about the CRISI
grant program and our eligibility or lack thereof. I think it
is a question that, as you look towards reauthorization, making
sure that there are opportunities for agencies like ours to
pursue funding for those cleanest burning technologies.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Very well, thank you so much.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr.
Burchett for 5 minutes.
Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Kettle, Metrolink is taking some steps, I believe, to
reform its commuter rail business model. What would ticket
prices be for you to break even?
Mr. Kettle. It is going to take some time for us to play
this all out, Congressman. It is a great question. I think what
we are going to look towards is, by growing the number of
riders, we are hoping to keep our fares exactly where they are
today as we grow our service. It is just going to take time to
see if that generates the ridership that we hope it does,
because we can't keep doing the business the way we have been
doing it.
Mr. Burchett. What is your current deficit?
Mr. Kettle. Well, I think that any commuter railroad in the
country is going to say we are a public transit agency----
Mr. Burchett [interrupting]. That is just----
Mr. Kettle [continuing]. Right now our current----
Mr. Burchett [interrupting]. That is just a simple
question.
Mr. Kettle. All right. Our farebox recovery right now is 13
percent. So, public sources besides our farebox come to that
number of 87 percent that requires additional public support.
Mr. Burchett. So, you don't have an exact number of your
deficit.
Mr. Kettle. I do not. I can provide that to you, sir.
Mr. Burchett. I would like that. You serve a region in
southern California from San Diego to Los Angeles Counties. It
seems to me like it is the State's and counties' responsibility
to subsidize your services, not the Federal Government.
Your request that the Federal Transit Administration would
waive interest on two locomotives because California passed
some very costly and very, very burdensome rail regulations, to
me, is out of touch. Our Nation is already $35 trillion in
debt, and billions in Federal handouts are already available to
rail. California's excessive regulation is a problem, and it's
folks like you that don't--if you all don't speak up at the
State level, it's only going to get worse for everyone else's
sake. The rest of the country shouldn't have to pay for
California's mistakes.
I yield the remainder of my time, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr.
Johnson for 5 minutes.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Today, the
demand to increase accessibility, opportunity, and equity
through infrastructure improvements is more attainable than
ever before because of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act passed by Democrats, along with a few Republicans, Joe
Biden's legislation, which provides $1.1 trillion--I think
probably $200 billion of that going to rail--the largest
investment in the Nation's rail system, probably. Well, I don't
know how long it has been, but it has been a long time, and it
was long overdue. We did it, but we need to do more.
And when finding solutions to the challenges confronting
commuter rail systems, we cannot overlook the critical
necessity of adequate funding for capital projects, service
expansion, and enhancing transit ease of access, particularly
for underserved communities.
Mr. Kettle, you have caught a lot of flak for being from
California today. That is unfortunate. Not that you are from
California, but you are catching flak for being from
California. In your testimony, you discuss Metrolink's
commitment to delivering safe and convenient passenger rail
service, while emphasizing the importance of Federal support
for the commuter rail industry's modernization efforts. How
does Metrolink ensure its service expansions and improvements
benefit all community members, including those living in areas
with little to no transportation access?
Mr. Kettle. Thank you, Congressman Johnson. The Metrolink
system is an expansive system, 545 miles. We go through a lot
of communities, many communities where freight railroads have
long traveled.
As we look to transform ourselves away from just being
about the commuter, but about the user of our system for so
many other purposes--a discretionary trip throughout the
midday, the peak, the evening--that, I think, is something you
are seeing throughout the industry, that we have to change our
business model. That is what is going to ensure equity in
transportation.
If we are built only around the commuter, generally
speaking, we are building for some essential service workers,
but primarily for white collar workers. That is not what we can
be for the long term. And by instituting and implementing more
midday service, evening service, and weekend service, that is
providing equity and mobility that our region has never seen in
a region as large as southern California. So, that is where we
are going full steam ahead to try to make that happen. We see
that as our real opportunity for our future.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Well, it definitely seems like a
viable alternative, particularly as commuter rail passengers'
ridership has declined since the pandemic and the advent of
work from home.
What programs and initiatives can the Federal and local
government implement to mitigate barriers in service for
marginalized groups such as language, mobility, and awareness?
Mr. Kettle. Well, the Metrolink system--the nature of
access to our system, I think it comes back to frequency and
reliability of service for those that use our system.
Access, we can always improve our access at our facilities,
at our stations, on our equipment that is, in some cases, out
of date. So, I think those are areas, as we overhaul equipment,
those are our opportunities.
But I do think, Congressman, the biggest opportunity for us
to make sure that we are providing access is making sure we are
providing frequency and reliability of our trains throughout
our system so that people can count on us when they need us.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. Have you seen
collaboration between Federal, State, and local governments in
advocating for support and funding for transit projects or
programs?
And where do you see the need for improvement?
Mr. Kettle. The very nature of our system--we operate a
five-county system. I work for five counties that make up the
Southern California Regional Rail Authority. We are all about
collaboration. We all come together to fund our system. Our
local--those counties are funding a big part of what we are
doing, it is not all on the Federal Government. But we do come
to the Federal Government and State government to help support
the needs of the region.
So, we are very, very strong in our collaboration at all
levels, including Sacramento, as well, the State capital.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, and that concludes my
time.
And I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr.
Menendez for 5 minutes.
Mr. Menendez. Thank you, Chairman. First, I just want to
let our ranking member, Congressman Payne, know that we are
thinking about him, wishing him a speedy recovery.
I also want to welcome Mr. Corbett, who serves as the
president and CEO of NJ Transit. NJ Transit operates bus, light
rail, and commuter rail throughout New Jersey, carrying
thousands of people every day to work and helping our
constituents move through the region.
NJ Transit provides an essential service to the State and
to our district. Last fall, they sprang into action to take on
additional bus routes after private companies operating in
Jersey City announced the closure of several essential routes.
I applaud NJ Transit for ensuring that our constituents remain
connected to essential resources and preventing gaps in
service.
Mr. Corbett, as your testimony highlights, the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has been a critical
investment for infrastructure across the country. Our district
has received almost $11 billion in grants from the IIJA,
including $6.9 billion for the Gateway Project alone. The
importance of these funds for our district cannot be
overstated. Just yesterday, NJ Transit and Amtrak service was
disrupted along the Northeast Corridor for hours due to
overhead wire problems, disrupting the evening commute for
thousands of people.
Mr. Corbett, what happens when there are issues with
infrastructure on even a small section of the Northeast
Corridor?
Mr. Corbett. Thank you, Congressman, great to see you.
Mr. Menendez. Yes, sir.
Mr. Corbett. We are the most densely populated State in the
Union, as you well know, and we are back--COVID, the days of
COVID--we are packed, our trains, rush hour, you see standing
room only. So, if we have 1,000 people on a train and we have
20-plus trains an hour going into New York, if they are delayed
even 10 minutes, that backs up trains all the way down to
Philadelphia. So, that means thousands, tens of thousands of
commuters are stranded.
Our number-one cause of delays for New Jersey Transit is on
the Northeast Corridor, for our whole statewide system. And
that ties into the catenary and infrastructure. And Amtrak is--
that is what they inherited from the Pennsylvania Railroad. A
lot of that catenary goes back to the 1930s. The signal system,
these are almost 100-year-old systems, as Congressman Moulton
touched on. So, if that is not repaired and brought up to
standard, for us it is important to prioritize that. To upgrade
the catenary and the signal system would be huge.
The other big bottleneck, as you know, is Portal North
Bridge. And certainly, the chairman--we would love to have
anyone from the committee come up. That is a huge bottleneck
that within 2 years will be eliminated. And that is what this
kind of funding provides us and Amtrak to do.
Mr. Menendez. I appreciate you highlighting those points.
It is why it is so critically important that we continue to
provide robust funding for our State and regional partners as
we continue to invest in rail.
I want to just switch quickly to commuter trends. Over the
past couple of years, transit agencies across the country have
been struggling with budget deficits. At the same time, we have
also seen a large shift in commuter trends. And we know that
more people are working from home, which means less folks
commuting into work, which means less fares for public transit
agencies.
Mr. Corbett, about how much of New Jersey Transit's budget
relies on fare?
Mr. Corbett. We rely on, for the operating budget, about 20
percent from Federal money. Our capital plan is over 40
percent.
So, again, our system, we don't--as you saw with Midtown
Direct Service, and as Congressman Kean talked about, having
our service--direct ride, one-seat ride into New York, when you
do that, property values soar in the surrounding communities.
We are a big boom of transit-oriented development. That
generates tremendous wealth, but we don't capture that
ourselves. So, even if we are running at a deficit, we are
generating wealth for the whole economy. So----
Mr. Menendez [interrupting]. But fares go into a large part
of what your operating budget is. And so, if you have less
fares, your operating budget is constrained because less people
are using your services.
Mr. Corbett. That is right, but we do see--on buses, we are
back to pre-COVID levels. On rail we are about 80 percent. I
think in the New York market particularly, people are not
working Fridays. They say they are working from home. The jury
is out on that. So, we do see that pulling down our average
ridership. But weekend ridership, people are using a lot of
weekends. So, the trend is ripe.
But, it was--you couldn't raise the fares during the
pandemic, and now we are having--we are raising our fares, as
you know. But we still need that Federal component to cover--
help us----
Mr. Menendez [interrupting]. Yes, I understand it is a
challenging dynamic. I think that is what we all appreciate
here, and we have talked about it with Secretary Buttigieg. As
you see these new trends, it creates difficulty for planning
purposes, operating purposes for public transit agencies, like
all of yours. And Congress wants to be here to be helpful,
especially this committee. And if you have ways that we can
partner together to make sure that we create that funding on a
go-forward basis so you have dedicated funding to make those
capital improvements, to ensure that we have a quality of
product that is a customer-forward product or commuter-forward
product, that is what we want to do.
Just quickly, Mr. Noland, my in-laws live in northern
Indiana, in Plymouth. So--and my sister-in-law lives in
Chicago. So, I appreciate your work, as well as what all of you
do, but New Jersey and Indiana is special for me. All right,
thank you all so much.
I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr. Ryan
for 5 minutes.
Mr. Ryan. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I appreciate the
opportunity to waive in here on an important topic to my
district. Thank you to everybody here. I represent the Hudson
Valley north of New York City, so, sort of on the other side
of--but have many of the same challenges as you do, Mr.
Corbett, in New Jersey, being part of the Greater New York City
metro area.
So, as you might imagine, the congestion pricing
conversation is very much on the minds of my constituents who,
along with me, are, frankly, very upset--I would say furious--
over this plan. As I am sure you know, the MTA is rolling out
what I think is an unfair, uninformed, and unacceptable
congestion pricing plan which would charge, in my district,
families up to $15 a day, up to $5,000 more a year, to commute
to Manhattan.
The problem there is that this comes with no commitments to
actually improve service in our system. So, you are asking my
constituents to pay a lot more with no guarantees, nothing in
the plan to upgrade service.
I know you all are sort of tangential to the MTA, but I
wanted to sort of get your take on that. And really, as I
understand your system, there are a lot more ride options, a
lot more frequency. So, if you could give any advice to the
MTA, and in my area in particular, and just talk about how you
see that playing out.
Mr. Corbett. Sure. Actually, your colleague, a friend of
mine, Mike Lawler, his district, we actually provide service.
We operate, I would say----
Mr. Ryan [interposing]. In Orange County, yes.
Mr. Corbett. Yes. MTA----
Mr. Ryan [interrupting]. We appreciate that.
Mr. Corbett [continuing]. Their best performance, the MTA
is actually the service we operate for them west of Hudson. So,
it is relevant.
Certainly, there are places in the world where congestion
pricing has worked: Singapore, Oslo, London, whatever. But in
this case, it really is just shifting the problem out without--
and MTA is taking that money, but it is not going to benefit,
for example, our west-of-Hudson MTA service, even. So, we need
to share in that money if it comes, so that we can provide that
service. And we need the capital investments to be able to get
a one-seat ride from Orange and Rockland County through into
Penn Station, New York. And right now, we are getting zero, and
it is just pushing the pollution.
So, we were very disappointed, and Governor Murphy
certainly is fighting, and I know Congressman Lawler is working
with Congressman Gottheimer, for example, to really make sure
that there is an equitable sharing of that funding, if indeed
it does go through.
Mr. Ryan. And I appreciate you being direct, and actually
letting the facts and the reality guide us, rather than some
delusional plan, particularly in the outer boroughs.
And I do want to thank you. Orange County is about half of
my district, so, you all operate that system. And most people
don't realize that west of the Hudson River in New York State,
there is no way to get to New York City without going through
New Jersey, which, no offense to New Jersey, but just doesn't
make a lot of sense. And the fact that zero dollars from this
huge, multibillion-dollar plan are going to go to improve
service to my constituents is incredibly frustrating, and, I
think, a significant public policy failure.
So, I appreciate your continued partnership on this, and I
look forward to working with you and others that, if we are
going to force this through, which it sounds like they are
going to try to do, I would like and will continue to push for
investments in single-seat ride for west of the Hudson for my
constituents and all the residents of the Hudson Valley.
So, that is the main topic that I wanted to bring up, and I
appreciate everybody here and your commitment to all of our
communities.
And I yield back, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr.
LaMalfa for 5 minutes.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it.
Thank you, panelists.
Let me launch right in here. As a Californian here, we have
been observing the debacle that the high-speed rail project has
been for many years. It took several times on the ballot for
voters to even have a crack at whether they wanted to decide to
be bonded by $9.9 billion for the project that was told to be a
$33 billion project. Now the real numbers are out, and it is
well over $120 billion. The project needs at least $100 billion
from some other source that is unknown. Private investment is
not happening. They are not coming in unless you can guarantee
your return, which is prohibited by the initiative that put it
in place. So, you can't guarantee or underwrite high-speed rail
systems.
So, Mr. Dech, I wanted to run this by you here. For what we
could be doing instead of high-speed rail--I call it high-cost
rail--in California, is local rail, commuter rail, using
regular trains that would run a commute distance and adding to
them--there has been a Sacramento to the bay area one--wouldn't
we--for a lot more bang for the buck when we are talking--we
are still short $100 billion--to invest that in private
companies or other, more local possibilities, or enhancing
local possibilities that we would have?
Mr. Dech. I think there is benefit to both. We are in a
unique spot in south Florida, where we are witnessing both of
those. So, we have our railroad, which is public
transportation, commuter rail, and we run just a couple of
miles away from Brightline. And you can see the advantages and
disadvantages to both.
So, I have seen that where the private contractors and
private entities can get things done very quickly, they don't
have some of the restraints that we have when we are spending
public money. So, I do think that there is room in the pool for
both of us, so we are both very successful in south Florida----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Are you talking high-speed
rail, or public----
Mr. Dech [interrupting]. Both. I think there is room for
both. We see Brightline in Florida, they run not quite 200
miles an hour, but they are 125 miles an hour between Cocoa
Beach and----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Now, is that on conventional
tracks?
Mr. Dech. Those are on conventional tracks, yes, sir.
Mr. LaMalfa. All right, because it is horrifically more
expensive to do the high-speed-rail-type tracks that are
capable of 220, the long, elliptical turns, and you have to
just cut through communities and everything else on that basis.
So, it is a lot.
Now, if you are talking something that is a lot more
affordable like that, I would like to see more work--and that
is kind of what I am talking about--more work done on up to
125-mile-an-hour rail on using conventional track and more
conventional trains. That would be a fraction of the cost that
we are talking about.
So, I've got to move quickly here. So, Mr. Kettle and Ms.
Johnson, we are seeing more and more mandates in California on
locomotives done by our--it is known as CARB, the air resources
board. They are constantly ratcheting down numbers of what the
emissions are allowed on locomotives. I see a bit, actually, on
social media about Arizona is opposing it being forced on them,
and even a national mandate emulating California.
I mean, I always tell people, don't do what California
does, it will just cost you.
So, are you--Mr. Kettle, Ms. Johnson, are you aware of the
rule being put in place by California on locomotive standards
being continually ratcheted down and trying to implement new
technology ? It might even end up being complete electric.
Mr. Kettle. Congressman, this is Darren Kettle with
Metrolink in southern California.
I will take this, Ms. Johnson, given that we are dealing
with it real time.
Yes, Congressman. So, when CARB originally came out with
their initial rule, we opposed it because we had concerns about
technology being available for us to be able to run zero-
emission locomotives. Over the course of the rule development,
we negotiated a position to give us time to fully complete our
fleet at Tier 4 locomotives, the cleanest burning diesel.
Mr. LaMalfa. Tier 4?
Mr. Kettle. Tier 4.
Mr. LaMalfa. So, you get to keep diesel, you don't have to
go to electric. Is that----
Mr. Kettle [interrupting]. Correct. We will not have to go
to zero emission for 25 years. It gives us the time, it gives
the industry time to actually develop the technology to get to
zero emission for push-pull locomotives.
Mr. LaMalfa. What do you expect that new technology is
going to look like, batteries that last longer or----
Mr. Kettle [interrupting]. Batteries or hydrogen, sir.
Mr. LaMalfa. Hydrogen?
Mr. Kettle. Hydrogen or batteries. Those are the two zero-
emission fueling sources that are out there.
Mr. LaMalfa. And let's say 20 years from now, when you
start running up against that deadline and you are not anywhere
close, kind of like CARB did in 1990, as I recall, what do you
do then?
Mr. Kettle. We are hopeful that when CARB sees that--if the
technology does not exist at that point, they do have within
their rule an analysis of the technology. So, at that time we
will know more. But again, 25 years buys us some time.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK, thank you.
Sorry that didn't work out, Ms. Johnson. The 5 minutes
flies by. Maybe someone else will open it up for you. But thank
you.
Thank you all, panelists.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize 5 minutes
to another valuable member of this subcommittee, Mr.
DeSaulnier.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And Mr. LaMalfa, this reminds me of our long debates on
this issue 20 years ago, when we debated in the legislature
about extension cords for battery-electric cars. I think you
lost that debate.
But anyway, and as a former member of----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. The cord wasn't long enough, is
what turned out----
Mr. DeSaulnier [interrupting]. Right, right. Anyway, I made
a comment about I would be supportive of that for your district
if the district had electricity, I think, which was unfair, but
it got a good laugh.
Anyway, as a former member of the California Air Resources
Board, I appreciate the--appointed by two Republicans and one
Democrat, and the public health standards were held to under
the Clean Air Act signed by Richard Nixon and the California
Clean Air Act signed by Governor Ronald Reagan. So, more
comment on how the Republican Party has changed vis-a-vis
public health.
Mr. Kettle, I have a district in the San Francisco Bay area
not dissimilar. I am very familiar with your challenges in the
South Coast. Long commutes, I think, between L.A. and the bay
area. We have over half of the mega-commutes in the country, 2
hours or more as people go further away.
So, in that context, in many years of trying to figure out
how our investments in California--very car culture--in
transit, in commuter, intercity and intracity rail, and high-
speed rail, and the challenges of peak trips--so, when I was on
the MTC we had an agreement in one of our RTPs that we would
reach 10 percent of our peak trips. I think we got as high as 6
percent, as opposed to London, 90 percent. New York, I think,
is 20 percent, which is the best of the United States.
So, when all of us deal with these issues about land use
and transportation--and the 405 in West L.A., and induced
demand, and how those HOV lanes were filled up like this, we
know we have to invest in this. And I very much appreciate the
comments in this hearing, because we know that, exurban,
suburban, urban.
But what has changed in the last few years is what has
happened to the economy. Certainly in the bay area, where we
are going through layoffs in Silicon Valley and San Francisco,
we probably have close to 40 percent vacancy in downtown San
Francisco. For my commuters 25 miles east of that, they--
particularly people who are in the tech industry and can do
it--remote work. So, we have a great opportunity.
And of course, not to bore the rest of you with Prop 13 and
initiatives and municipal revenue and transportation revenue in
California, but how do you see your challenges, just when we
were starting to attract more people into traditional peak
commutes that would make that farebox recovery and make more
discretionary opportunities for your governing board?
This is a wonderful opportunity, but it is fraught with
risks and challenges. So, how do we take advantage of this, not
punish people to make them start to go back into work and the
employer doesn't pay for that commute time?
In California, we rely predominantly on sales tax, which is
regressive. So, this is the wonderful opportunity in areas like
yours and mine, but it is fraught with challenges.
Mr. Kettle. Thank you, Congressman DeSaulnier. Good to see
you again, sir.
Yes, so, in southern California right now, the peak has
changed. Four years ago, the world changed. In Los Angeles, our
major urban center where jobs had been plentiful and vacancy
rates were low, we are at about the same as the San Francisco
Bay area and the San Jose area, where, again, two markets that
had large peak commute periods.
The other thing that has really changed is that the peak
has changed. What used to be this 9 o'clock in the morning or 8
o'clock in the morning to 5 o'clock in the afternoon is
fundamentally different. So, we are looking at how do we
reimagine who we are to provide train service at different
times of the day into the evenings and on weekends, because it
can't just be about that commute. And so, that's our push.
It is not for the faint of heart to look at some new
concepts about how we are going to change how we do our
business, but I think it is critical. It is going to be the
only way that we are going to stay sustainable, because we know
continuing business practices the way they are today, just
looking at the standard peak, that's not sustainable long term.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Just briefly, we know that density is very
important in modeling around the world. So, getting those peak
trips and reverse peak trips and getting higher density around
your hubs and transit-oriented development, could you respond
to that?
Mr. Kettle. I completely agree the density is important.
But again, in southern California, where affordable housing is
in the outlying areas, and we still have essential workers that
need to get to urban areas, we have got to make sure we are
getting to some of those less dense areas, as well.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you very much.
Mr. Kettle. Thank you.
Mr. DeSaulnier. I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. We are going to go to a
second round. Mr. LaMalfa has other questions for you, so, we
are going to do that.
So, Mr. LaMalfa, a second round. Go ahead, sir.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you. I just have a retort, too, for my
great colleague from the bay area there. The Republicans didn't
leave those pieces of legislation that Reagan and others have
signed. They left us, OK? They have been weaponized for 50
years and turned against us in court decision on court
decision. We are still all-in for those positive things. But at
this point, you can't even hardly make a move to do simple
things.
And as far as the electricity going all the way up to my
area, it is getting harder when the enviros tear out my
hydroelectric dams up on the Klamath and don't replace the
electricity. So, yes, we do look like we are less electrified.
So, anyway, but he is my good pal. I am not--this is fun
banter here. Anyway----
Mr. DeSaulnier. We have a comedy routine. Bear with us.
I respect your reference to Senator Jeffords.
[Laughter.]
Mr. LaMalfa. OK. Thank you, panelists.
And Ms. Johnson, I am going to throw that question back to
you I had a little bit earlier on the CARB and the technology
and the locomotives, et cetera, that we were talking about.
Ms. Johnson. Yes. Thank you very much, Congressman. I would
like to state for the record I was previously in California,
recognizing I am in Denver, Colorado.
And so, to Mr. Kettle's point that was raised relative to
having more or less a 25-year exemption, recognizing that CARB
had originally put forward the Innovative Clean Transit
regulation for 2040, I don't feel as I could opine, recognizing
that I run the agency in Denver, Colorado, as it relates to
where we are currently.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK, OK. Thank you. Back to Mr. Dech.
When we were talking about local lines, commuter rail, and
such, I have been interested a long time, especially as we
suffered with the super high costs and massive delays on
California's high-speed rail. And I guess if there is good luck
in Florida and they are paying for it themselves, great. I
don't begrudge anybody doing that and having it economically
working out.
But how much more can we benefit from 125-mile-an-hour
trains on regular tracks, and what would it take to raise our
infrastructure, our, you know, rail, the track condition to be
suitable? How much potential is there for a lot more 125-mile-
an-hour tracks in any given area around the whole country, or
regionally, what have you?
Mr. Dech. So----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. And is that a good way to be
able to achieve higher speed without having the hyper-expensive
high-speed rail?
Mr. Dech. So, I will preface this by saying I am by no
means an expert on high-speed rail, but I do know that once you
start getting to those speeds, you really have to worry about
your grade crossings. So, the biggest concern for me is going
at any higher speeds than that is grade separating and making
sure that you don't have the road crossings. When you have a
train going 125 or 200 miles an hour, those grade crossings
become critically important. And that is where you really get
that cost factor that goes in with raising those, is that you
are separating from your conventional road crossings.
Mr. LaMalfa. And if you are talking rural areas, can you
possibly build enough split-level crossings through fields and
farmland and all that stuff?
Mr. Dech. With enough money, anything is possible.
Mr. LaMalfa. Well----
Mr. Dech [interrupting]. That is the answer to that. It's
an investment.
Mr. LaMalfa. Well, every crossing, I hear, is about $40
million. In California it's probably double that at $80
million. And I don't know if you can do that on every little
small bird like I have in my district. And we certainly can't
be taking away all these crossings because they are critical to
small towns and ag areas.
But overall, do you see much potential for--instead of
being hell bent on 220-mile-an-hour, hyper-expensive, is there
a lot of potential for 125-mile-an-hour conventional tracks to
be able to kind of fit that need for higher speed that people
seem to be looking for?
Mr. Dech. I think it depends on the area and the service
and what you want. If you are looking at--like, in particular,
the Brightline West that is going to go from Los Angeles to Las
Vegas, the business model is to get you there faster than a car
in a high-speed train. So, that is a private entity making that
investment that they can do that. So, I do believe that it is a
matter----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Yes, unfortunately----
Mr. Dech [continuing]. Of what the customer----
Mr. LaMalfa [continuing]. It started out as a private
concern, and then recently, I think, $3 billion of Federal
money got dumped in on that. I was very disappointed in that
because it was touted as being private the whole time.
Does anybody else on the panel want to touch on that 125-
mile-an-hour rail topic?
Sir.
Mr. Corbett. The only thing I would say, in New Jersey,
with the dense population we are running with Amtrak, one of
the things is not just hitting a certain X number of miles per
hour, it is the whole trip. So, if you are doing 160 miles an
hour, but then you have got to slow speed because you have
ancient infrastructure that you have a temporary speed
restriction doing 60 or 35 miles, it sort of obviates it. So,
it is the whole system from A to B to make sure that you can
keep a steady higher speed than necessarily be the top, the
Shinkansen or whatever kind of speeds.
Mr. LaMalfa. Yes. I mean, I focus on 125 because that seems
to be where it becomes a quantum jump into rail technology that
has to be hyper more expensive.
So, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your extra time. I yield
back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. Are there any further
questions from any members of the committee?
There being none, this concludes our hearing for today. I
would like to thank each and every one of you. The first
hearing, I guess, we have had in this subcommittee for commuter
rail in 20 years. So, job well done. Great dialogue today.
The committee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:54 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Submissions for the Record

----------

Statement of Fred Craig, Chair, Association for Innovative Passenger
Rail Operations, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Troy E. Nehls
I am Fred Craig, Chair of the Association for Innovative Passenger
Rail Operations or AIPRO. (See Addendum #1--About AIPRO) I also serve
as Chief Operating Officer of Transdev Rail in North America. On behalf
of AIPRO we appreciate this opportunity to present testimony to this
Subcommittee on the potential future of passenger rail in the United
States.
The Case for the Competition Model on Commuter and Intercity Corridors
The prior witnesses at this hearing have made a compelling case
that competitive selection of operators and service providers is a
valuable option when selecting partners for their services. These
commuter agencies are the primary customers for our AIPRO operating
members, which are Herzog, Keolis, Transdev and RATPDev. It should also
be noted that two Rail Labor Organizations the Brotherhood of Railway
Signalman and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees are
active AIPRO members.\1\ Developing strong partnerships between these
agencies and our service providers and rail labor has been the key to
efficient and successful operations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ In addition to AIPRO passenger rail contract operators, the
Railroad Cooperation and Education Trust (RAILCET), representing
unionized rail construction contractors, is also a proponent of the
competition model for expanding commuter and intercity passenger rail
service. RAILCET is comprised of two building trade unions, LIUNA and
IUOE and thirty rail contract companies with whom they have a national
agreement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While this hearing is not focused on the intercity corridors, the
witnesses from SFRTA and RTD presented a compelling case that having
qualified firms bid for their services is the model that works best. In
this written testimony, we argue that the ways commuter agencies select
operators though through competitive processes provide excellent models
for expanding the current and future intercity rail market. The
substantial number of FRA Corridor Identification and Development (CID)
projects now in process make the competitive model completely feasible.
Our primary AIPRO objective is to maintain the forward progress on
competition in the commuter arena while at the same time building a
similar framework for implementation of FRA CID intercity corridors
across America. Today, states/authorities sponsoring intercity projects
have two clear options. One--they may select from the Competitive
Models currently used by commuter agencies which have been so well
articulated in this hearing. Two--they may stay within the Traditional
Amtrak Model which has been the dominant method of contract partnering
between the states and operators for the last half century. We
encourage the Competitive Model to be applied to both the commuter
market and state supported intercity CID corridors where appropriate.
In fact, there is minor difference in the basics of commuter rail
operations, under FTA authority for financial support, and state
supported intercity operations, largely under the authority of FRA.
Both rail services are regulated for safety under the FRA regime. As
Chairman Nehls said, at the opening of this hearing, ``private sector
providers help lower costs, improved services, and increased
ridership.'' In this regard the extensive expertise of the established
commuter agencies and their private sector partners could be of immense
value in the emerging world expanding intercity rail corridors. The
question is how to make it all work together?
The issue of creating a better future for passenger rail falls
squarely within the jurisdiction of this Subcommittee. Since the 2008
PRIIA Act, Congress has laid the foundation for a competition model on
intercity corridors. (See Addendum #2--Congress Encourages the
Competitive Model on Intercity Corridors.) With the opportunity created
by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law it is time to accelerate this pro-
competition trend.
As re-authorization time approaches, we propose your committee
pursue a targeted re-arrangement of railroad passenger law to more
effectively build a robust and cost-effective rail passenger network
that better maximizes the benefits of commuter operations and the
expanding CID intercity corridors. The legislation should encourage
competition for operations and services in both arenas. In this
testimony we will identify specific issues we believe should be
addressed.
The Competitive Direct Access Model for FRA CID Projects
Compared to many regions around the world, America's intercity
passenger network is lacking in many ways. While our country has
neglected its national rail passenger system, the developed world has
created an amazing web of high speed and high-performance rail
passenger service. Now, we are at an inflection point in America. The
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law or BIL has appropriated significant
funding and created a process that gives us new hope. Can we bring home
the dream in the next round?
We suggest BIL's FRA Corridor Identification and Development
Program (CID) is the pathway to constructing a high-performance
intercity passenger network. While advancing high speed rail and long-
distance corridors are important, we suggest a primary early objective
should be a massive commitment to city-pair corridors under 750 miles.
A strong framework is already in place. States and localities must
commit to managing the projects and subsidize the operations. For the
first time states have significant federal-state partnership grants
available for capital related projects. As the CID pipeline progresses,
FRA can become an integral partner and guide implementation of the
national program. Currently there are thirty state supported routes
with sixty-nine new projects being studied through FRA funding. This
model is roughly akin to the Federal Highway Program with federal
oversight and significant funding. This is appropriate.
The Competitive Direct Access Model. Federal law clearly permits
alternative passenger operators and service providers to become
partners with states/authorities in developing intercity corridors
under 750 miles. However, since Amtrak has been the only game in town
for a half century, it takes a new platform to introduce the
competitive model. AIPRO is collaborating hard with stakeholders and is
developing a model based on commercial principles and permitting
competitive options for selecting passenger rail operators and service
providers. We call this the Competitive Direct Access Model. This
provides the states with both the Traditional Amtrak Model and the
alternative Competitive Direct Access Model for expanding and managing
their intercity corridors under FRA guidance.
Our Direct Access Model eliminates statutory operator preferences
over track owners. Access, metrics, and standards, including on time
performance, are negotiated legal contracts. The Model will encourage
competition for services and require early expressions of interest from
potential operators and service providers on any given project. It will
also incorporate fair labor practices designed to produce good jobs.
The goal is a streamlined process.
We do not underestimate the difficulty of the task ahead. The
Traditional Amtrak Model has pretty much been the sole method for
contracts between the states and an operator on an intercity corridor.
It excludes the competitive option. The Competitive Direct Access Model
opens the market to alternative operators and service providers. For
the last year, AIPRO and its allies have been developing a pragmatic
template for this innovative approach. It is based largely on previous
work by a Class 1 railroad and has been used effectively in the
commuter arena. It has been adopted by the Chippewa Rail Commission
which proposes a new Corridor ID service.

The Competitive Direct Access Model is designed under
current law and needs no statutory change (See Addendum #3--Moving to
the Competition Model)
+  On-Time-Performance Metrics and Standards. It positions
projects through commercially negotiated access as well as metrics and
standards including on-time performance.
+  Competition Test. States/authorities will be encouraged to
adopt a formal two-step procedure to evaluate the market for a
competitive option. The Step 1 planning stage will include a simple
solicitation of expressions of interest to determine the viability of a
competition. Assuming there is interest, Step 2 in the project
development stage will include more formal Expressions of Interest and
then later in the process Requests for Proposal. The entire Direct
Access Model needs to be streamlined to assure the delivery of
equipment at the appropriate time in the implementation cycle.

Fair Labor Practices. Achievement of fair labor practices
that will produce good paying jobs while creating flexibility to
achieve success in new vulnerable corridor operations.

Streamlining. This process will be designed to not add
any additional time to make a project operational. The competitive
option will run concurrently with other project activities such as
construction and equipment delivery.

Again--we are advancing the Direct Access Model framework under
current law.
Looking Toward a new Authorization--What Should Congress Do?
With a new BIL authorization on the horizon, we suggest a
restructuring of the passenger rail law is in order. Here are a few
areas that we believe would create a good result.

Promotion of a pro-competitive policy--Legislative
provisions should proactively promote passenger rail innovation and
competition.
+  The statute should require a competitive method for selecting
rail service operators as a condition of grants where practicable.
+  Specific rail programs should require competitive criteria
for applicant states and local agencies.
+  The process should include a requirement for simple
Expressions of Interest in the planning stage to evaluate the
competition option.
+  PRIIA Section 301 grant competitive requirement should be
referenced in the criteria. States can select Amtrak or an Operator
without a competitive process if they meet the following PRIIA 301
test--If the State/Authority does not select the operator competitively
it must ``provide written justification to the secretary showing why
the proposed operator is best, taking into account price and other
factors and that the proposed operator will not unnecessarily increase
the cost of the project.''

Infrastructure and Equipment Funding. There should be a
sustainable funding source available to major providers of rail service
on a fair basis including commuter agencies and states/authorities
sponsoring passenger rail.
+  Commuter agencies should have access to the CRISI.
+  Federal grants should have set-asides to build state capacity
to manage state supported routes.
+  The federal-state partnership program should be available
exclusively to the states and authorities sponsoring corridor
development.
+  Grants available to states/authorities should not be
available directly to competing operators including Amtrak or Private
Operators such as Brightline, Herzog, TransDev, RATPdev or other
operators or service providers.
+  Equipment and Liability--The legislation should address the
insurance shortfall and create an adequate equipment pool available
directly to states and commuter authorities.

Amtrak Reforms--The political reality is such, it will
undoubtedly be necessary to maintain Amtrak's statutory privileges
including access and metrics and standards. These should increasingly
become a fallback last resort. Wherever possible the tilt should be to
the competitive model.
+  Amtrak should not have statutory privileges that increase
their power over commuters or other publicly funded agencies. They
should deal on a commercial basis as equals. STB should be given clear
authority to mediate and resolve disputes between Amtrak and commuter
agencies.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Indeed, the new STB Passenger Rail Advisory Committee (PRAC)
may prove instrumental in making recommendations to the Board and
Congress on how best to use the STB capacity and experience in
developing a pragmatic competition platform for expansion of intercity
corridors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
+  Amtrak Operations should be separated from other functions and
made an independent entity with transparent accounting and
accountability. The planning functions should be separated as an
independent office or transferred to FRA. A level playing field should
be created between Amtrak operations and alternative operators and
service providers with whom Amtrak will compete.

Insurance and Liability--There should be a complete
review on liability and options for coverage of both commuter and state
supported rail operations. (See Addendum 4--Insurance and Liability)
+  The Commuter Rail Coalition proposal for an additional year to
secure insurance when the federal cap is increased should be adopted.
+  Options for reform including pooling arrangements should be
pursued.

Equipment--How can the many needs of the emerging state
supported corridors be met? Amtrak cannot efficiently meet the growing
requirements of the states and/authorities for the 69 CID corridor
projects. Assorted options, including an FRA equipment pool available
to states/authorities should be reviewed in the coming months.

Finally, AIPRO would ask this Subcommittee to consider a future
hearing on the legislative ideas we have put forward as well as those
from other stakeholders. Our immediate goal is a package of reforms
that will streamline relations between the FTA oriented commuter world
and FRA CID intercity corridors to produce the most cost-effective
alternative to produce a high-performance rail passenger network across
America.
Thank you!
ADDENDUM #1--AIPRO and Its Mission
About AIPRO. We are an alliance of independent operators, labor
organizations and associates dedicated to advancing innovative
passenger rail operations in the United States. The organization is
made up of passenger rail professionals including operators, labor,
rail construction contractors, consultants, and other stakeholders. We
share the goal of a transparent and competitive marketplace. The Board
is composed of Transdev; Keolis; Herzog; RATPDev; BRS-BMWE (rail labor)
and McGrath Rail (rail construction). Our Associates include Direx
Consulting and Safe Track. For more than a decade AIPRO has pressed its
goals in a low-key fashion. We believe we are now poised to make a
significant contribution to the creation of an American high
performance passenger rail network.
Today the AIPRO companies play a significant role in the American
passenger rail space. In 2019 Amtrak carried about thirty million
passengers while the AIPRO companies carried eighty million passengers.
Certainly, all passenger rail took a terrible hit in the pandemic. In
2020 Amtrak carried 16.8 million passengers, a 47.4% decrease and the
commuter world saw a similar decline. However, ridership is coming
back. In 2023 Amtrak carried twenty-eight million passengers. Commuter
operations are seeing a similar rebound. In 2023 AIPRO companies
carried about 65.5 million passengers by rail in the US (Transdev 2.1
million; Herzog 17 million; Keolis 30 million; RATPDev 15.4 million).
Globally and in America our members compete fiercely against each
other. They run everything on the rails from streetcars to high-speed
trains. Internationally my company Transdev carries over 608 million
passengers a year. Keolis carries about 470 million passengers. RATPDev
passenger count totals a whopping 1.5 billion annually. Together our
members transport about 2.6 billion passengers by rail each year. This
is the equivalent of carrying every American citizen 7.8 times a year.
AIPRO members have incredible experience and a great deal to offer.
We are anxious to contribute to the creation of an American high
performance passenger rail network in the coming decade.
ADDENDUM #2--Congress Encourages the Competitive Model on Intercity
Corridors
In the late 1950s and 1960's passenger service operated by freight
railroads collapsed. Amtrak was organized in 1971 as a federally
controlled entity that would be managed as a ``for profit'' corporation
that would receive taxpayer subsidies. It was given a monopoly over
intercity passenger train operations as well as special privileges
including forced access to freight rights of way at incremental cost
and a metrics and standards priority to be enforced at the Surface
Transportation Board. At that time no viable passenger operators were
on the horizon.
Over the last half century times have changed. There is now a
robust group of independent passenger rail operators that run tens of
thousands of trains in the United States and carry 2.6 billion rail
passengers internationally. How did this happen? Toward the end of the
20th century new commuter agencies moved to the model of competition
for operations and the current AIPRO members became principal players.
By the end of the last century, Congress began to nudge intercity
passenger rail in the direction of a competitive model. It began to
recognize the growing diverse marketplace for expanding passenger rail
operations and services. By 1997, Amtrak had received more than $20
billion in federal funding and there was no end in sight. Recognizing
the growing number of passenger rail operators in the commuter field,
Congress repealed the prohibition against alternative passenger service
providers operating over intercity corridors without Amtrak's consent.
In the PRIIA Act of 2008, Congress strengthened the role of the
states to manage all intercity corridors under 750 miles. PRIIA,
Section 301 added a new requirement that compelled state grant
applicants to use a competitive process in the selection of an
operating partner. Further a predecessor Coalition to AIPRO (Herzog-
Transdev-NRC) negotiated a provision, also included in PRIIA Section
301, to protect rail labor rights on these intercity corridors in the
event there was an operator change from Amtrak to an independent
operator. Thus, the rail unions became agnostic as to the operator, and
in some cases, are now in active support of the Competition Model being
developed by AIPRO.
PRIIA 2008 encourages intercity passenger service.

Section 209--States, not Amtrak, were made fully
responsible for operating losses on the state supported routes under
750 miles.

Section 301--Established a grant program for the states.
Unfortunately, for assorted reasons, the 301 grants were smothered in
the bureaucracy cradle.\3\ However, these grants available to states
were revived in a big way in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)
and other FRA grant programs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ The Obama High Speed Rail appropriation pumped nearly $11
billion into rail projects outside the PRIIA 301 framework. The PRIIA
grants then died for lack of an appropriation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 301--Requires that as a condition of grants,
states are to select operators competitively. If a state does not, ``it
shall provide written justification to the secretary showing why the
proposed operator is best, taking into account price and other factors
and that the proposed operator will not unnecessarily increase the cost
of the project.'' AIPRO believes this to be a critical provision that
should be strengthened in the next authorization and fully applied by
FRA.

Section 217--Provides that states selecting alternative
operators shall have access to Amtrak facilities, equipment & services
with STB binding arbitration. This provision has never been assessed
but could become important.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ Again, this should be an appropriate issue to be reviewed by
the STB's new Passenger Rail Advisory Committee.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 305--Provides states with responsibility for and
access to Next Generation passenger cars.

Section 205--Created an Alternative Passenger Rail
Service Pilot Program. Again, this program failed in the implementation
and should be revisited.

The FAST Act of 2015 strengthened the PRIIA provisions promoting
competition and enhancing the role of states. Then came the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law (BIL) signed into law in November 2021. In total it
appropriates about $1.2 trillion over 5 years for transportation and
other infrastructure. It appropriated about $39 billion to improve
transit and $66 billion primarily for intercity passenger rail. Much of
this intercity funding is available through the Federal State
Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Program. Here both the states
and Amtrak are eligible for these grants. This includes $36 billion in
advance appropriations. Throughout the BIL the option to pick
alternative operators for intercity corridors is fully protected.
ADDENDUM #3--Moving to Competition Model
Progress to Date. In the pre-pandemic world Amtrak pressed for a
$75 billion trust fund giving Amtrak all the money and the authority to
manage all intercity passenger rail development. This would have
provided complete control over intercity passenger operations. The
infrastructure law, drafted by a bipartisan group in the Senate,
rejected that approach. It placed FRA in charge of design and funding
of the intercity passenger rail network outside the Northeast Corridor.
It provided states with substantial funding for the first time ever,
primarily through the Federal-State Partnership Program. It is
specifically agnostic on the choice by sponsoring states/authorities of
contract operators and service providers. Thus, either Amtrak, an
alternative service operator or a combination can become the contract
partners who operate the passenger service in the intercity corridors.
Specifically, the BIL:
a.  Puts the Federal Railroad Administration in complete charge of
developing the intercity passenger network outside the NEC through the
new Corridor Identification and Development program (CID). This creates
a system of partnering between states, contract operators and service
providers (which may or may not include Amtrak), and FRA. These
operating partnerships then enter the CID funding pipeline. AIPRO is
convinced that vigorous competition for the partnering role will bring
a high-performance rail network to America.

b.  Provides significant grant funding to the states for the first
time. Through the Federal-State partnership and other grant programs
states now have access to more than $66 billion over the next five
years. The USDOT Build America Bureau (BAB) currently has about $110
billion in soft money to lend.

c.  Provides two clear options for the state/authority CID grant
applicants to choose operators and service providers in these emerging
corridors. First, of course, states can deploy the Traditional Amtrak
Model and keep Amtrak as the exclusive partner. Or states have the
alternative option to choose partnering corridor service providers
competitively. In many cases, given the long history, Amtrak will be
the logical partner. They clearly have an essential role in the future
of intercity passenger development. But--there will be circumstances,
particularly on new routes identified under the CID program where the
competitive model will make the most sense. That will be the sweet spot
for AIPRO. We are working to refine that competitive mechanism which we
are calling the Competitive Direct Access Model.
ADDENDUM #4--Insurance and Liability
This is a complicated and critical arena. An insurance solution
must be built into the Direct Access Model so that the cost of claims
does not sink the benefits of competition. AIPRO is looking at a range
of options for the emerging intercity corridors. This includes
everything from property-by-property insurance coverage on the Commuter
model to pooling arrangements, likely through the USDOT, and ``nuclear
type'' coverage. We believe the liability issue needs to be addressed
legislatively in reauthorization.
The liability regime in 49 U.S.C. Sec.  28103, with the ever-
increasing federal cap, makes it extremely difficult for commuter
authorities or states to obtain adequate coverage. The per incident
liability cap is expected to reach $397 million in 2026. Increased
exposure and a shrinking rail insurance market threatens the future of
passenger rail.
Amtrak has tools to address these liability concerns across
intercity passenger routes. Given its direct federal subsidy and
special statutory protections for self-insurance, Amtrak gets a ``head
start'' on the cost of claims. Some states/authorities with their
private operators in the commuter arena have found ways to ``skin the
cat'' on liability--but none are as simple or cost-effective as
Amtrak's federal support and captive off-shore insurer. On intercity
operations, this has already been accomplished on the Hartford Line as
well as the Brightline operation in Florida. We believe similar
arrangements can be crafted on the FRA Corridor ID expansions. We are
optimistic that liability coverage can be arranged for the emerging
intercity corridors as it was on the Hartford Line and Brightline.
To that end, Congress should work to re-level the field. Here are
some options:
(1)  Requiring Amtrak to offer coverage to any intercity operator
or state sponsor through its Passenger Rail Insurance Plan with fair
and reasonable terms and conditions. Disputes could be resolved by the
Federal Railroad Administration or the Surface Transportation Board.

(2)  Enacting a statute that would permit states to extend their
sovereign immunity to intercity passenger rail operators by contract.

(3)  A USDOT solution. The Build America Bureau programs (RRIF)
could be used as a backstop. In another alternative, FRA could provide
a federal ``match'' (akin to the federal appropriation to Amtrak) to a
risk liability pool for intercity commuter rail operators or state
participants that would also contribute and obtain coverage through
that pool; or

(4)  Eliminating Amtrak's ``head start'' by requiring Amtrak to
obtain a bona fide third-party policy--without ``self-insurance'' and
Passenger Rail Insurance Ltd.

Statement of Stephen Gardner, Chief Executive Officer, National
Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), Submitted for the Record by
Hon. Seth Moulton
Introduction
As Amtrak's Chief Executive Officer, I am pleased to submit this
statement for the record following the House Railroads Subcommittee's
April 17 hearing entitled ``Getting to Work: Examining Challenges and
Solutions in the Commuter Rail Industry.'' I thank you for giving me
this opportunity to share Amtrak's views on the important issues
discussed at the hearing that affect Amtrak.
Amtrak and Commuter Railroads
As the testimony at the hearing indicated, until the COVID-19
pandemic, commuter rail service was experiencing a renaissance, with
many new services added and significant expansion of existing services.
Amtrak, working in conjunction with our commuter and state partners,
has played a major role in that renaissance.
Amtrak is the largest host railroad for commuter rail service in
the United States. Since we acquired most of the then decrepit Boston-
to-Washington Northeast Corridor (NEC) from its bankrupt private
railroad owner in 1976, investments to increase NEC capacity and
upgrade infrastructure have allowed the number of commuter trains
operating over the NEC to more than double. In addition to increasing
trains on existing commuter rail services, Amtrak has accommodated many
new and extended commuter rail services on the NEC, the busiest
railroad in the United States; Amtrak's Hartford Line between New
Haven, Connecticut and Springfield, Massachusetts; Amtrak's Keystone
Corridor between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and at
Amtrak's Chicago Union Station, where the number of commuter trains has
also increased enormously since Amtrak acquired control. Each weekday,
approximately 2,000 commuter trains of 10 commuter authorities and
state departments of transportation operate over the Amtrak-owned and
operated portions of the Northeast Corridor and on Amtrak-owned
trackage in Chicago.
We are far from finished with adding commuter rail service on
Amtrak-owned lines. Construction to accommodate new Metro-North
Railroad service between New Rochelle and New York Penn Station on
Amtrak's Hell Gate Line, one of the few segments of the NEC without
commuter rail service, is currently underway. The Hudson Tunnel, on
which we expect construction to begin next year, and other
transformative infrastructure investments that are part of the Gateway
Program that will double capacity between Newark, New Jersey, and New
York City, will allow passengers on NJ Transit's Raritan Valley Line
and other NJ Transit lines who must currently change trains to reach
New York City to enjoy a one-seat ride directly into New York Penn
Station.
In addition to infrastructure access, Amtrak also provides railroad
operations services to commuter railroads around the country. As noted
at the hearing, Amtrak is one of the seven full-service operators of
contract commuter rail services in the United States. Unlike most of
the other operators, we are a U.S.-based company and all of our non-
management employees who provide commuter rail services are members of
one of our 15 labor unions and councils. We operate the Maryland Area
Regional Commuter (MARC) Penn Line service between Washington, D.C.,
and Baltimore and Perryville, Maryland; the Metrolink service provided
by the Southern California Regional Rail Authority (SCRRA) in the Los
Angeles area; and the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT)
Shore Line East service between New Haven and New London, Connecticut.
All of these commuter rail services have experienced tremendous
growth since Amtrak began operating them. For example, the number of
weekday MARC Penn Line trains has increased from six when Amtrak became
the operator in 1983 to 57 today. We also provide equipment maintenance
services for MARC, CTDOT, Sound Transit's Sounder commuter rail service
in the Seattle area, and the Central Florida Commuter Rail Commission
for the SunRail commuter rail service in the Orlando area, as well as
some services for the Virginia Railway Express service in Washington,
D.C. and NJ Transit.
Amtrak's Statutory Access Rights
Amtrak strongly favors collaboration rather than an adversarial
approach in all of our dealings with stakeholders. We were therefore
disappointed that we did not learn of the proposals of the Commuter
Rail Coalition (CRC) to diminish Amtrak's statutory access rights for
operation of our trains over commuter railroad-owned lines from CRC
itself. Instead, we found out about CRC's proposals when the Surface
Transportation Board (STB) posted on its website an ex-parte letter CRC
sent to STB members last December.
CRC's letter urged that commuter railroads, and other railroads not
relieved of obligations to provide intercity passenger rail service by
the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (RPSA) that created Amtrak, ``be
treated differently'' by the STB should Amtrak seek access to their
lines. The letter ignored the fact that the pertinent statutory
language, codified at 49 U.S.C. 24308, applies equally to all railroads
and commuter rail authorities, as the STB and its predecessor, the
Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), have repeatedly recognized. At
the Subcommittee's recent hearing, one of the witnesses representing
CRC urged that commuter railroads be given a complete veto power over
the operation of Amtrak trains on their tracks, stating that commuter
railroads ``should not be . . . forced to provide access to Amtrak
trains, absent a mutually acceptable agreement.''
The testimony at the hearing by witnesses representing CRC made it
clear that CRC has a fundamental misunderstanding of Amtrak's statutory
access rights.
First, Amtrak trains do not have statutory preference or priority
over commuter trains. Section 24308(c) of title 49 gives Amtrak trains
only ``preference over freight transportation'' (emphasis added).
Second, the statutory provisions that govern Amtrak's access to
freight and commuter railroads already require what CRC's witnesses
claim it is seeking: ``good faith negotiations'' before a dispute can
be brought before the STB and ``protect[ions] when Amtrak seeks to
exercise its [rights].'' The STB and ICC have always interpreted 49 USC
24308(a), which gives the STB jurisdiction if Amtrak and a host
railroad ``cannot agree,'' as requiring good faith negotiations before
a dispute can be brought before them. The parallel statutory provision
that governs STB resolution of disputes regarding commuter railroad
operations over Amtrak-owned rail lines, 49 U.S.C. 24903(c)(2),
contains a virtually identical requirement that the parties must ``not
agree'' before the STB's jurisdiction can be invoked.
Section 24308 already provides numerous protections for all host
railroads when Amtrak seeks an STB order allowing it to initiate or
continue operations over their lines. For example:

Section 24308(a)(2)(A) empowers the STB to issue orders
granting Amtrak access only if the STB finds that is ``necessary to
carry out'' the purposes of Amtrak's governing statutes.

Section 24308(a)(2)(A)(ii) requires the STB to
``prescribe reasonable terms and compensation.'' The STB has held that
Amtrak's payments must compensate the host railroad for all incremental
costs attributable to Amtrak's operations, and that Amtrak (or its
state partners) may be required to provide funding for capital
investments to increase rail line capacity, or to upgrade tracks and
other infrastructure, to accommodate new or additional Amtrak trains if
the Board deems this necessary.

Section 24308(a)(2)(B) authorizes the STB to award
compensation in excess of incremental costs that is based upon quality
of service, as the ICC and STB have consistently done.

Given these safeguards, there is no basis for any of the major
changes in and exceptions to Amtrak's longstanding statutory access
provisions that CRC is seeking. Nor is there any factual support for
CRC's purported concerns that Amtrak will run roughshod over commuter
railroads to force its way onto their lines. As the testimony at the
hearing indicated, Amtrak has made no attempt to do that. Moreover,
under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the United
States Department of Transportation, acting through the Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA), is tasked with leading efforts to expand
and increase intercity passenger rail service. The FRA-led Corridor
Identification and Development (Corridor ID) Program the IIJA
established will determine what corridors will be prioritized and
awarded FRA grants for infrastructure and other capital investments
required to accommodate new or increased service. The addition of new
short-distance (under 750 miles) routes and trains will also continue
to be dependent upon state funding support. What this means is that FRA
and states, rather than Amtrak, will play the lead role in determining
where expansion of intercity passenger rail service will occur.
In the 53 years since enactment of the RPSA, Amtrak has brought
only seven cases before the ICC or STB seeking access to a railroad's
lines for new or rerouted services. None involved a commuter railroad.
The only case under what is now Section 24308 in which a commuter
railroad was a party pertained to compensation for the operation of
existing Amtrak services.
While Amtrak has reached negotiated agreements with host railroads
in the vast majority of cases in which it has added new routes or
trains, Amtrak's statutory access rights are absolutely essential. If
they no longer applied to all freight and commuter-railroad owned
lines, a single railroad that owned just a couple of miles of track on
a route could arbitrarily preclude Amtrak from initiating a new
service, or force Amtrak to discontinue service on an existing route
when the contract governing Amtrak's operations expired. Twelve of
Amtrak's 15 long distance routes, and many of its state-supported
supported routes, operate in part over commuter railroads or on
railroad lines that in 1971 were owned by railroads not relieved of
their intercity passenger rail service obligations.
Finally, there is no basis for special treatment for commuter
railroads when it comes to compensation for Amtrak's operations over
their lines. All of the commuter railroad-owned lines that Amtrak
operates over were acquired by their present owners after Amtrak was
created in 1970, with full knowledge of Amtrak's statutory rights. It
also bears noting that, outside of the NEC, state-supported trains
primarily funded by Amtrak's state partners account for nearly 85% of
Amtrak train miles on commuter railroads. This means that states would
have to provide funding for the vast majority of the additional
compensation that CRC seeks for its members. We see no reason why
Amtrak and our state partners should be obligated to pay more merely
because of changes in the ownership of rail lines over which our trains
operate, most of which occurred many decades ago.
Commuter Rail and Amtrak Eligibility for Federal Grant Programs
As indicated by the testimony at the hearing, capital projects that
solely benefit commuter rail service are not eligible for Consolidated
Rail Infrastructure and Safety Investment (CRISI) grants awarded by the
Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). There is a good reason why
projects that only benefit commuter rail service are not eligible for
the FRA-administered federal grant programs for ``rail'' projects:
commuter railroads are considered ``transit'' services, which makes
them eligible for the federal grant programs administered by the
Federal Transit Administration, primarily funded through the Highway
Trust Fund, for which Amtrak is ineligible. While CRISI received $5
billion in advance appropriations in the IIJA and an additional $1.4
billion in annual appropriations since its enactment, the federal
transit programs for which commuter railroads are eligible received
$107 billion in guaranteed funding in the IIJA.
While the vast majority of CRISI grants are awarded to short line
and regional freight railroads, CRISI is an important source of funding
to Amtrak for safety, job training and other projects that in many
cases are not eligible for other competitive grant programs. Although
projects that solely benefit commuter rail service are ineligible for
CRISI grants, states and regional transportation authorities can
receive CRISI grants for projects, such as the proposed Hunter Flyover
on the NEC mentioned at the hearing, that benefit intercity as well as
commuter rail service. (Amtrak supported NJ Transit's 2022 application
for a CRISI grant for the Hunter Flyover.) Many CRISI grants have been
awarded for projects that benefit both commuter and Amtrak service. For
example, SCRRA received a CRISI grant for a project to make track,
signal and safety improvements on one of its lines in Burbank,
California that was eligible for CRISI funding because Amtrak also
operates over the line.
Needless to say, making projects that solely benefit commuter rail
service eligible for CRISI grants would reduce the relatively small
amount of federal funding that Amtrak and short line and regional
railroads receive through federal ``rail'' grant programs, and
exacerbate the longstanding disparity between federal funding for
Amtrak and the funding provided for transit and highways. Were Congress
to make commuter rail-only projects eligible for CRISI grants, it
should also repeal the statutory provision, codified at 49 U.S.
5302(15)(B)(1), that prohibits federal transit funds from being used
for intercity passenger rail service provided by Amtrak.
Effective Date of Increase in Statutory Cap on Passenger Liability
Amtrak supports the recommendation of the witnesses at the hearing
that the effective date of the adjustment for inflation in the
statutory cap on passenger rail liability that occurs every five years
be extended from 30 to 365 days after USDOT announces the new cap. As
those witnesses testified, the availability of passenger liability
insurance for rail has significantly decreased since the statutory
provision requiring the inflation adjustment was enacted in 2015. Some
insurance carriers have left the rail insurance market, while others
are reducing the lines of coverage they provide or increasing premium
costs. Needless to say, the suspension of Amtrak service if a commuter
railroad over which Amtrak operates is unable to increase its insurance
coverage to the level of the adjusted cap by the current, relatively
short, statutory deadline would have a major adverse effect on Amtrak
and its passengers.
Additionally, many would be surprised to learn that commuter
railroads--unlike Amtrak and virtually every other form of passenger
transportation--are not required by federal law to maintain any
liability insurance. Many commuter railroads also have sovereign
immunity under state law that significantly limits their liability for
personal injury claims in the event of an accident, and their ability
to honor contractual indemnification obligations. If Congress extends
the effective date for increases in the statutory cap on liability for
rail passenger claims, it should also amend 49 U.S.C. 28103, which
requires Amtrak to maintain a minimum level of liability insurance, to
make that requirement applicable to commuter railroads as well. Since
the testimony at the hearing indicated that all U.S. commuter railroads
are contractually obligated to maintain liability insurance with
coverage limits in excess of the level specified in Section 28103,
making this a statutory requirement should not adversely impact any
commuter railroad. However, creating consistency in the application of
the law will ensure the many agencies around the United States
considering new commuter rail operations understand from the outset
what is necessary regarding liability insurance, which could help
minimize negotiations over this topic with railroads over which they
seek to operate.
Amtrak and Commuter Railroads: The Opportunity for Collaboration
As discussed at the hearing, the work of the NEC Commission
established by the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of
2008 demonstrates what can be accomplished when Amtrak and commuter
railroads work together to plan, secure funding for and carry out
infrastructure investments. The comprehensive, 15-year, CONNECT NEC
2037 capital investment plan the NEC Commission has developed will
maximize the benefits of the IIJA funding made available for the NEC by
prioritizing the projects for which there is the greatest need and that
will provide the largest benefits to NEC commuter, Amtrak and freight
operations. Another outstanding example of Amtrak, commuter rail, state
and freight railroad collaboration is the Transforming Rail in Virginia
program, which is advancing unprecedented investments that will improve
and increase capacity for commuter, Amtrak and freight rail service
throughout Virginia.
We strongly believe that Amtrak and commuter railroads should work
together to improve their service and infrastructure and serve more
passengers to help make the case for the increased, sustained federal
funding that both need. We view commuter railroads as collaborators
rather than as competitors for existing track capacity and the small
portion of federal transportation spending that currently goes to
passenger rail.
Amtrak has recovered nearly all of the ridership we lost as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Fiscal Year 2024 ridership through
February was only 2% below our ridership during the same pre-COVID
period in Fiscal Year 2020, and we are projecting that we will end this
Fiscal Year ahead of our pre-pandemic ridership and revenue levels. As
indicated by the testimony at the hearing, commuter railroads have not
been as fortunate, as most are still carrying significantly fewer
passengers than they did before the pandemic due to increases in hybrid
and remote work. To respond, many commuter railroads are looking to
grow ridership by attracting more passengers who are traveling off-peak
and for purposes other than work commutes.
One way that can be accomplished is through greater collaboration
and improved, more seamless, connectivity between their services. Last
year, 24.5 million Amtrak passengers began or ended their trips at just
six Amtrak stations--in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City,
Philadelphia and Washington--that are also hubs of those cities'
commuter rail systems. Millions more Amtrak passengers boarded or
deboarded at the many other stations throughout our network where
Amtrak trains connect with commuter trains. Collaborative efforts by
Amtrak and commuter railroads, facilitated by advancements in
technology and investments in infrastructure, can help break down the
barriers, such as uncoordinated schedules and separate ticketing
systems, that discourage passengers from connecting between Amtrak and
commuter trains today. That would enable both Amtrak and commuter
railroads services to attract much needed new passengers and help the
public gain more utility out of these respective systems funded by
their tax dollars.
Needed in Reauthorization: Multi-Year Funding
The significant multi-year funding the IIJA has provided through
advanced appropriations has been, as one hearing witness stated, a
``game-changer for the Northeast Corridor.'' That funding is allowing
Amtrak and its commuter rail partners to at last commence construction
of vital NEC infrastructure projects, including the Hudson Tunnel, the
Frederick Douglass Tunnel in Baltimore and the Susquehanna River
Bridge. Completion of these projects will ensure continuity of NEC
operations, enhance reliability and performance, and provide much
needed capacity for expansion of high-speed, intercity and commuter
rail services along our nation's most important transportation artery.
IIJA funding is allowing Amtrak and its commuter, state and local
partners to advance much needed infrastructure investments on our
National Network, such as the Chicago Hub Improvement Program that aims
to transform Amtrak and commuter rail service at Chicago Union Station
and enhance rail infrastructure used by Amtrak trains throughout the
Chicago area.
Of all of the issues discussed at the hearing, the most important
is ensuring that substantial, assured, multi-year funding like that the
IIJA provides through advance appropriations continues when a new
surface transportation bill is enacted. Without that, the enormous
progress that Amtrak and commuter railroads have made in advancing
joint benefit infrastructure projects on the NEC, in Chicago and
elsewhere on our National Network will not continue.
Conclusion
Amtrak looks forward to continuing to work with our commuter
railroad partners to ensure that Amtrak and commuter rail service
realize their full potential. Expansion of both commuter rail and
Amtrak service should be encouraged rather than impeded. We see many
untapped opportunities for improving collaboration on infrastructure
projects and enhancing connectivity between Amtrak and commuter rail
services, and for joining together to make the case for increased
funding for all passenger rail services.

Questions to Michael Noland, President, Northern Indiana Commuter
Transportation District, and Chairman, Commuter Rail Coalition, from
Hon. Valerie P. Foushee

Question 1. Your statements at the hearing seemed to indicate that
you believe Amtrak has a statutory right to priority scheduling on
commuter railroad-owned tracks. Amtrak has shared with the Committee
that it does not believe it has this right of preference on commuter
railroad-owned track, but does have a statutory right of access.
Could you please clarify what you meant by this/these statement(s)?
Answer. 49 U.S.C. Sec.  24308(c) gives Amtrak statutory preference
to operate its service over that of freight transportation. Amtrak has
interpreted the statute to include preference for Amtrak trains over
freight trains operating on lines owned by commuter railroads. For
example, in response to questions by the late \
\ Donald M.
Payne, Jr. in 2021, Amtrak's Chief Executive Officer, Stephen Gardner,
replied as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Editor's note: Representative Payne died on April 24,
2024.

``Question 12. Does Amtrak believe it has superior statutory
rights over commuter railroads as it does over the lines of
freight railroads? If yes, explain the grounds for this claim.
ANSWER to 12 & a. Amtrak's statutory right to preference over
freight transportation (49 U.S.C. 24308(c)) does not give
Amtrak trains preference over commuter trains. It does give
Amtrak trains operating over commuter-railroad owned lines
preference over freight trains operating over those lines.''
(Emphasis added.) \1\

\1\ Plans for Expanding Intercity Passenger Rail, Remote Hearing
before the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous
Materials of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House
of Representatives, 117 Cong. 37 [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/
CHRG-117hhrg47413/pdf/CHRG-117hhrg47413.pdf] (Dec. 9, 2021), Appendix
(Questions from Hon. Donald M. Payne, Jr. on behalf of Hon. Eddie
Bernice Johnson to Stephen Gardner, President, National Railroad
Passenger Corporation).

However, because neither 49 U.S.C. Sec.  24308(c) nor any other
statutory provision also gives commuter railroads similar rights over
freight transportation, commuter railroads are often at a disadvantage.
Because they have no statutory right of preference, both Amtrak and
freight railroads that dispatch commuter operations often place
commuter operations in a position where they effectively yield their
operations to both Amtrak and freight trains, even if a delayed Amtrak
or freight train could disrupt the on-time service of the commuter
operations. The resulting reality leaves commuter railroads at a
distinct disadvantage and compromises the reliability of their service.
Moreover, as owner of certain corridors and facilities used by commuter
railroads, Amtrak's control over dispatching in an environment where
the commuter carriers have no statutory protection of either first or
equal priority, gives Amtrak the ability to give its trains priority
over commuters even where its trains are delayed and will cause
disruption to commuter operations.
Of note, in contract negotiations with commuter railroads, Amtrak
repeatedly requires commuter operators to provide Amtrak with
dispatching priority over that of commuter railroads, often citing its
statutory rights of access \2\ as leverage over the commuter railroads
in its negotiations. This statutory right of access, a right that can
be enforced by the Surface Transportation Board, and the terms of which
can be set by the Board if the parties cannot agree on a governing
contract, places Amtrak in a distinctly advantageous position.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ 49 U.S.C. Sec.  24308(a).

Question 2. Have you ever been unable to come to a contractual
agreement with Amtrak? Are you currently in active negotiations with
Amtrak regarding new or expanded intercity passenger rail service on
Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District-owned lines?
Answer. Given Amtrak's statutory access rights under 49 U.S.C.
Sec.  24308(a), Amtrak has a disproportionate advantage in contract
negotiations over commuter railroads. The agency uses this authority to
secure the right to operate on tracks owned, controlled, operated or
managed by commuter railroads, enjoying the public capital investments
made by state governments without providing sufficient value to
compensate for its access. When possible, for example, Amtrak chooses
to operate over commuter-owned railroads over freight lines because the
commuter lines are already improved to benefit passenger operations and
will not require the same level of investment by Amtrak to make them
suitable for Amtrak's use.
In Northern Indiana, for example, the State of Indiana has invested
hundreds of millions of dollars into the Northern Indiana Commuter
Transportation District (``NICTD'') to improve its lines by double
tracking and adding other capacity enhancements designed to increase
and both frequency and reliability of sits service offerings into
Chicago. Amtrak already has a route into Chicago on the lines of
Norfolk Southern, but despite the investments the federal government
has made to improve service on the NS corridor, Amtrak has expressed
interest in moving its service onto NICTD. While they have advised that
they would only do so if they could negotiate an agreement for use of
the NICTD corridor, because of Amtrak's statutory right, NICTD cannot
refuse to negotiate. In addition, Amtrak has the statutory right to
access and is only obligated to pay the incremental costs of its
service on NICTD's line. These rights put NICTD, or any other publicly
funded commuter line at significant disadvantage in the negotiating
process, and are subject to Amtrak's unilateral decision whether or not
to enforce its rights. In short, Amtrak's statutory rights put the
commuter industry at risk of losing the benefit of the service
enhancements made possible by its substantial investment in its system
if it is required to allow Amtrak to take up capacity for commuter
service, and receive minimal, inadequate, and as a result unfair
compensation for providing Amtrak access.

Questions to Michael Noland, President, Northern Indiana Commuter
Transportation District, and Chairman, Commuter Rail Coalition, from
Hon. Seth Moulton

Question 1. Is increasing speed a goal on your commuter rail
system? How does the implementation of Positive Train Control
contribute to efforts to increase network speeds?
Question 2. Has your system created initiatives to attract more
riders? If so, have you seen the results of these initiatives?
Answer. Thank you for providing the opportunity to expand on my
April 17 testimony in front of the Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure's Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials
subcommittee. Indeed, the industry's thoughts on improving commuter and
passenger rail operations in the United States exceed what could be
covered in a single hearing.
Commuter and regional passenger rail is one of the safest and most
efficient modes of public travel and plays an important role in the US
transportation network. Passenger rail provides direct and indirect
economic value to a region, promotes economic investment in communities
along its corridors, and provides an unparalleled capacity to move
people and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
As an industry, we pride ourselves on our safety initiatives,
always looking to augment our safety-first culture. Positive Train
Control (PTC) has further enhanced already safe commuter and passenger
rail operations and provides a platform for the industry to further
improve. This multi-billion dollar initial capital investment, and the
on-going annual operating and capital funds needed to maintain the
system--almost entirely resourced with local funding--are now part of
our everyday operating environment.
The deployment of PTC was complicated, and the federally mandated
timeframe required the industry to focus its efforts on standing up the
system as efficiently as possible to meet the required deadlines. We
have since discovered PTC's shortcomings: decreased operational
performance, caused by both system reliability issues and lower overall
train speeds. These operating performance impacts are a byproduct of
both the maturity and limitations of the technology, and the
conservative nature in which it had to be developed and deployed to
meet the implementation deadline. Similar to the investments into Next
Generation (NextGen) Air Traffic Control systems, continued investment
in PTC and related technologies will provide railroads an opportunity
to not only address these impacts, but also improve operational
performance and efficiencies by extracting value out of system and the
initial investment the industry has made.
PTC's impact on train handling and resulting operational
performance come in various forms, but the most prevalent are related
to technology reliability, PTC technology performance trade-offs
associated with implementation timelines, and how operating crews
interact with the technology. The first two are byproducts of the
nature in which PTC was implemented, where certain limitations in
capability and performance were accepted as a necessary trade-off in
order to implement the systems in the timeframe required. Limitations
to Global Positioning System (GPS) accuracy and reliability, as well as
the use of conservative enforcement algorithms that approximate
performance of several vehicle types are examples of known limitations
that have an impact on operational performance \1\. While the industry
is working with its PTC suppliers to improve these elements, this
requires continued research well as continuous investment to update
both the hardware and software deployed across the system.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Additionally, certain PTC technologies that utilize traditional
cab-signal track circuit codes to enforce speeds are limited by the
number of electrical signals that can be sent through the rail without
interference. In practice, if the safe design speed of a curve is 55
mph, but the PTC system only has speed codes for 30 and 60 mph, the
operating speed for the entire track circuit that includes that curve
is limited to 30 mph (a 25 mph difference).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As noted above, the implementation of PTC has also changed how
train engineers operate their trains, including impacts on train
handling. Our train crews, seasoned conductors and engineers, have
provided great insight into the daily performance restrictions that
have resulted under this new safety overlay system. As an example, when
an engineer is operating a train and their speed is approaching the
track speed limit, warning alarms sound in the operating cab of the
train to alert the engineer that a braking enforcement is imminent. To
avoid risking a PTC braking enforcement (a computer-enforced train
stop), engineers keep their trains well below authorized track speeds,
and likewise, begin braking far in advance of what is actually
necessary to safely operate the train.
To be clear, we are not advocating that engineers operate their
trains in excess of authorized track speeds but have observed that PTC
often indirectly compounds the safety margins that were already present
in railroad operating rules and regulations. If a train is authorized
to travel over a segment of track at 50 mph, the engineer will often
operate their train at 2-3 mph below the authorized track speed to
avoid the potential of PTC enforcement by the nature in which PTC was
implemented. Reduction in available track speed can result in a loss of
3%-4% of safe and approved operating speeds. This loss of operational
performance translates directly in to longer travel times for our
riders, reduced efficiency and increased energy consumption, and
reduced capacity on the overall rail network. By extension, this loss
also is a diminution of the capital investment our industry has made in
the rail system's infrastructure.
To define this issue and identify opportunities to safely improve
operating performance, we suggest that the Railroads, Pipelines and
Hazardous Materials Subcommittee consider instructing the Department of
Transportation to undertake a detailed study of the impact of PTC on
railroad operating performance. As part of this study, it would be
helpful to understand the level of investment required to continue to
make the technological improvements required, and if there are any
regulatory modifications that could be made to improve passenger
railroad operations with PTC. This will help the industry further
maximize the investment made in the technology and support the
passenger rail industry in delivering the competitive transportation
solution that rail provides.
An example of what could be considered is the speed limits set for
classification of track \2\. Under FRA rules, track speeds are set to
ensure safe operating performance with associated levels of maintenance
and grade crossing warning protection. These standards have been in
place for many decades and have not been examined in relation to how
railroads operate today, with technologies such as PTC and current
railroad operating practices. Class IV track, for example, has a
maximum authorized speed of 80 miles per hour (mph). We know our
equipment, maintenance and inspections practices have greatly improved
since this standard was put in place. Can FRA Class IV track speeds be
adjusted from 80 mph to 85 mph safely? By holistically examining the
safety margins in place, and the flow-down effect of how different
regulatory requirements translate to operating a modern passenger
railroad today, the industry would be better positioned to mitigate the
unintended operational restrictions imposed by compounding
requirements, such as PTC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Maximum authorized operating speeds are governed by track
safety standards contained in 49 CFR Part 213.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We know from studies, surveys and rider feedback that our customers
demand greater schedule frequency--especially outside of the
traditional morning and evening peak periods--reduced time to and from
their destinations, more reliable service, and amenities such as wi-fi
on-board our trains. The challenge is how we meet these customer
expectations, maintain stable operating budgets, and provide the
necessary investments to deliver the service that our customers demand.
We believe that the opportunity to study the impact of PTC (and
associated operating regulations) on railroad operations has the
ability to deliver improved performance without compromising any aspect
of safety, and at little or no additional cost. When aligned with long
term and continued investments in infrastructure and improved PTC
capability and functionality, Congress can help ensure that commuter
railroads can reach they full potential as an essential transportation
mode, just as it has with highway and air travel (e.g., dedicated long-
term funding programs).

Question to Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and Chief Executive
Officer, Regional Transportation District (RTD), Denver, Colorado, from
Hon. Valerie P. Foushee

Question 1. Why is it important for passenger rail agencies to know
when hazmat is being transported on their property?
Answer. RTD does not share trackage with freight operations but
does operate parallel to freight. Emergency response is best served
with increased time to prepare and respond. Early notification of
potential hazards allows crews to be on alert. This is similar to
having personnel on high alert, for example, when a credible threat is
made against an organization.

Questions to Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and Chief Executive
Officer, Regional Transportation District (RTD), Denver, Colorado, from
Hon. Seth Moulton

Question 1. Is increasing speed a goal on your commuter rail
system? How does the implementation of Positive Train Control
contribute to efforts to increase network speeds?
Answer. Increasing the speed of commuter rail system is not
currently an RTD goal. Several factors contribute to this assessment:

RTD's rail network has a significant amount of single-
track sections. Increasing speeds only to reach a control point or
interlocking and having to stop to wait for an opposing train operating
in the opposite direction diminishes the return on any time gained
through faster speeds.

To effectuate increased speeds, RTD would need to
reconfigure its existing Positive Train Control system, including the
highly complex wireless grade crossing technology currently in place.
Implementation of the existing system was an extensive and complicated
effort that is still being perfected. Reconfiguring the system to
accommodate increased speeds and maintaining this new system would be a
costly and time-intensive endeavor.

The proximity and number of stations reduces the
effectiveness for potential high speeds, as trains need appropriate
distance to attain that speed and then appropriate distance to slow
down and stop at the next station.

Question 2. Has your system created initiatives to attract more
riders? If so, have you seen the results of these initiatives?
Answer. RTD has implemented several initiatives aimed at
incentivizing transit use, including but not limited to the following:

In August 2022 and July and August 2023, RTD offered zero
fares across its entire system as part of the Zero Fare for Better Air
initiative. The collaborative, statewide initiative was made possible
by a grant program administered by the state. The grant program was
designed to reduce ground-level ozone by increasing the use of public
transit. The zero-fare periods aligned with Colorado's highest ozone
months. While ridership increased significantly during these periods,
staff has not determined whether the program influenced commuting
behaviors in the long-term.

In September 2023, RTD launched Zero-Fare for Youth, a
one-year pilot program that aims to enhance the lives of RTD customers
and communities by reducing transportation costs for families. By
inviting individuals 19 years of age and under to use the system at no
cost, the agency removed barriers to education and employment, while
creating access to destinations across the metro Denver region. While
the overall success of the program will be evaluated closer to the
conclusion of the pilot period, reports from local school districts,
most notably Denver Public Schools, indicate that the program has had a
considerable positive impact on truancy rates. The agency will continue
offering zero-fare youth transit in future years through state funding.

Following an industry peer review of RTD's transit
policing model conducted in 2021, RTD shifted its transit network
security operations toward a community policing model, bolstered by
sworn police officers, with a corresponding reduction in the agency's
reliance on contracted security personnel. Responses to customer and
agency employee surveys indicate that respondents now have a higher
perception of personal security both utilizing transit and waiting at
stops and stations. Staff believes this enhanced perception of security
will yield a sustained increase in ridership.

Questions to David W. Dech, Executive Director, South Florida Regional
Transportation Authority (Tri-Rail), from Hon. Seth Moulton

Question 1. Is increasing speed a goal on your commuter rail
system? How does the implementation of Positive Train Control
contribute to efforts to increase network speeds?
Answer. We do not currently have any projects planned to increase
the maximum authorized speed of our railroad, We have a MAS of 79 mph.
We have 19 stations and rarely would have an opportunity to run over 79
mph given the spacing between our stations.
If we were to plan on increasing the speed, PTC upgrades would be a
significant factor in evaluating the cost vs. benefit as this would
necessitate almost a complete overhaul of the software and braking
algorithms.

Question 2. Has your system created initiatives to attract more
riders? If so, have you seen the results of these initiatives?
Answer. We have added our first ever set of express trains as part
of a pilot program to increase ridership. These trains only have 5
stops instead of 19. We are still evaluating but the program has had
moderate success with ridership around 400 passengers per day on the
set and growing.
We have added two additional trains in the late evening hours in an
effort to capture increased ridership from our airports. We met with
airport leadership, airport unions, and surveyed employees to find the
times that best fit. The results thus far have been mixed. We have
ramped up our marketing and outreach.
We have increased the trains that we will run for special events,
Taylor Swift, Ultra Music Festival, etc., in an effort to expose our
system to new riders. These trains have been very successful.
We sent teams to Miami to court local businesses as well as low-
income area to advertise our discount programs.

Question to Kevin S. Corbett, President and Chief Executive Officer,
New Jersey Transit, on behalf of the Northeast Corridor Commission,
from Hon. Valerie P. Foushee

Question 1. What does the development of the Northeast Corridor
Inventory, as required in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, mean for
the projects on the Northeast Corridor, many of which are 100+ years
old?
Answer. The creation of the Northeast Corridor (NEC) Inventory is
providing greater certainty for the advancement of NEC projects. The
NEC Inventory includes a list of projects that have been consistently
documented and tracked in the NEC Commission's multiple planning
publications. This vetting and documentation, which is being done as
part of the NEC Commission's routine annual processes, now allows the
Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to have a convenient, valid, and
predictable menu of options to choose from for its grant programs that
have been funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
The NEC Inventory and NEC Commission processes are a ``win-win''
for all parties, as the FRA now has a stronger knowledge base and
greater familiarity with details for all of the projects, resulting in
a faster and more efficient review of grant applications, while NEC
rail operators have more confidence regarding whether and when their
projects will move forward. Such progress is critical to replace and
improve and upgrade the NEC 's aging infrastructure that, as noted, has
been in place for more than a century.

Questions to Kevin S. Corbett, President and Chief Executive Officer,
New Jersey Transit, on behalf of the Northeast Corridor Commission,
from Hon. Seth Moulton

Question 1. Is increasing speed a goal on your commuter rail
system? How does the implementation of Positive Train Control
contribute to efforts to increase network speeds?
Answer. Yes, increasing speed if safely feasible is a goal.
However, it must be noted that implementation of Positive Train Control
(PTC) has arguably made the actual work to increase speeds more
complicated as the onboard and wayside equipment configurations have to
be modified in order to make changes to speed limits. If the speed
change is equipment specific, such as with particular types of
locomotives, all of those locomotives need to be boarded and have the
speed change done manually by the appropriate personnel from NJ TRANSIT
or the vendor of the PTC system. For changes to track speeds the
transponders on the rights-of-way need to be reprogrammed with new
speeds, and adjustments must be made to the overall design of the
transponder sequence as braking distances increase if speeds are
increased. This would involve design work by a vendor and then the
changeout of the transponders located between the rails in the affected
area by NJ TRANSIT personnel--all of which carry significant costs.

Question 2. Has your system created initiatives to attract more
riders? If so, have you seen the results of these initiatives?
Answer. There are a number of initiatives NJ TRANSIT has undertaken
to attract more riders, all of which collectively have had positive
impacts as evidenced by our rail ridership coming back at a strong and
steady pace. These initiatives include:

FLEXPASS--This was a creative pandemic-era ticket pilot
program that was extremely popular and attracted riders, both current
and new, who traveled several days a week, and so did not need a
monthly pass.

Four seasonal marketing campaigns targeting first-time
riders, as well as those who haven't ridden for six or more months.

Effective communication campaigns to reinforce the
customer experience improvements, safety and the reliability of our
system, including ``While You've Been Away,'' ``Ride Kind,'' and
``Daily Dose of Progress,'' among others.

Mobile App Enhancements to improve customers' travel
experience, including Station Arrival Alerts, How Full is My Train/Bus,
and more--4.8 stars with 217,000+ reviews in the Apple App Store.

Special Promotions to attract riders during events,
including discounts and special offers for Valentine's Day, Earth Day,
Fleet Week, Take Your Children to Work Day, the North 2 Shore Festival,
and more.

Marketing Activations at high visibility events,
including the Atlantic City Airshow, events at major colleges &
universities, and at the busy Secaucus Junction Rail Station during
concerts & sporting events at MetLife Stadium, among others.

Question to Darren M. Kettle, Chief Executive Officer, Southern

Question 1. You shared that Metrolink service linking with
Brightline West, once constructed and operating, is scheduled to run
hourly, independent of the regular commuter schedule.
How will this impact other Metrolink operations?
Answer:
Added Maintenance Capacity
Because Brightline West intends to connect its Las Vegas service
with Los Angeles via the Metrolink Rancho Cucamonga station, its
opening is forecasted to significantly increase the number of Metrolink
customers. As such, Metrolink is increasing maintenance capacity
overall within its system and growing its vehicle fleet to accommodate
future service growth. Specifically, the agency intends to build a new
maintenance facility in Orange County that includes additional service
and inspection tracks, a locomotive and passenger railcar heavy
maintenance shop, and a permanent materials storage building.
Pulse Scheduling
Metrolink will also ``pulse'' its schedule to provide customers
with seamless connections to the high-speed rail service. An intuitive,
reliable, hourly service between Rancho Cucamonga and Los Angeles Union
Station will sync with the private operator's schedule, thereby
ensuring little down time for customers looking to get to and from Las
Vegas.

Questions to Darren M. Kettle, Chief Executive Officer, Southern
California Regional Rail Authority (Metrolink), from Hon. Seth Moulton

Question 1. Is increasing speed a goal on your commuter rail
system? How does the implementation of Positive Train Control
contribute to efforts to increase network speeds?
Answer. Increasing system speed and travel time competitiveness is
dependent on several factors, including track design, signal spacing,
track infrastructure, and signal and crossing design and
infrastructure. Increasing speeds is a goal but one that requires
addressing one or more of these factors.
Positive Train Control (PTC) is a safety overlay system which is
intended to enforce the existing and underlying speed limits, whether
track, signal, or authority based. Some speed limitations are dependent
on track and signal geometry, design, infrastructure, or operating
rules and PTC can't be used to increase these speeds.
However, there are some instances where PTC can be used to increase
the capacity of the system. Industry efforts are underway to leverage
PTC to accomplish Quasi-Moving Block (QMB) and Fully-Moving Block (FMB)
methods of train control, which would allow higher throughput of
trains. Metrolink will be initiating a feasibility study and possible
implementation plan for Higher Reliability/Capacity Train Control
(HRCTC). HRCTC is the next generation of train control that leverages
PTC to deliver options like QMB technology.

Question 2. Has your system created initiatives to attract more
riders? If so, have you seen the results of these initiatives?
Answer. Metrolink has several initiatives underway to earn back
pre-pandemic riders and attract new customers.
Student Adventure Pass
Metrolink launched its Student Adventure Pass, a state grant-funded
pilot program that enables K-12, college, and trade school students
throughout Southern California to take the train at no cost. Between
October 2023 and April 2024, more than 209,000 riders took advantage of
the program. The share of Metrolink's total riders that are students
grew from 17% to 25%. Today, 34% of these students are new riders, an
indication Metrolink is successfully integrating our service into the
lifestyles of the next generation of riders.
Partnerships for Special Events
For the past two years, Metrolink and Insomniac Events have teamed
up to offer late-night trains for music festival goers, particularly
for events at the NOS Events Center in San Bernardino. These special
trains provide safe and convenient transportation for attendees, mainly
in the 18-35 age range, to get home without needing to drive. This
partnership aims to enhance the festival experience, reduce traffic and
parking problems, and provide increased revenue to Metrolink.
Metrolink is also offering special round-trip service to select Los
Angeles Angels home games during the 2024 baseball season. Adult
roundtrip tickets are $10 per person, and up to three kids ages 17 and
under can ride free with each paying adult, making the Angels Express
an affordable option for families. Metrolink's Anaheim stop at the
Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center (ARTIC) is adjacent
to Angel Stadium, allowing for a short walk to the ballpark.
Additionally, in partnership with the X Games, Metrolink has
extended service on the Ventura County Line to provide X Games Ventura
attendees an affordable and convenient transportation alternative to
driving. Special service to the event-adjacent Ventura-Downtown/Beach
Station, which is normally only serviced through Amtrak, reduces car
reliance while helping to familiarize infrequent or new riders with
public transit. Metrolink offered this enhanced service in 2023 and
will again be providing extended service in 2024.
Mobility-4-All
Mobility-4-All provides a 50% discount on any Metrolink ticket for
those who qualify via their California Electronic Benefit (EBT) card.
Since launch of this program in September 2022, monthly ridership by
low-income riders has grown by more than 30% year-over-year. More than
1,000 new low-income riders take advantage of the program each month
and low-income fares account for nearly one in ten Ticket Vending
Machine transactions.
$15 Summer Day Pass
On weekdays between the Memorial Day and Labor Day, Metrolink
offers a $15 Summer Day Pass. The seasonal promotional fare is designed
to attract infrequent or first-time riders and out-of-town visitors by
offering unlimited rides at a fixed price. In 2022, the first year the
pass was offered, nearly half of all passes (48%) were purchased by new
customers.
Free Fare Days
Metrolink's free fare days (Transit Equity Day, California Clean
Air Day and Earth Day) regularly result in record ridership levels by
encouraging those who do not normally take the train to try the
service. The highest ridership days this fiscal year were:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date                 Ridership
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clean Air Day............  10/4/2023               26,077
Earth Day................  4/22/2024               25,906
------------------------------------------------------------------------

More off-peak trains
For the last 30 years, Metrolink service has catered to 9 to 5
commuters, offering peak service in the morning to primary job centers
such as downtown Los Angeles and Orange County and then returning in
the evening. Today, as remote work and hybrid work schedules remain
common, travel patterns have changed. To respond, Metrolink has
announced it intends to transform its operations to meet weekend and
off-peak demand, which has returned more strongly than peak ridership.
The recommended schedule to transform our system to a regional rail
model would increase service by 36 trains per day, with 178 total
trains operating in the system, and would spread service across the day
and into the evening. The schedule would promote transfer opportunities
through ``pulse'' scheduling across lines, providing a more competitive
travel time when compared to driving.
The initial implementation of regional rail service occurred on the
northern Los Angeles County Antelope Valley Line in October 2023 with a
58% increase in revenue train-miles and demonstrated exciting results.
Most of the new service was added during non-commuter hours. For the
four months following the expansion of service on the Antelope Valley
Line (accompanied by systemwide roll out of free student fares in the
same month), total ridership increased by 27% compared to the same
period of the prior year. We expect to see further increases in the
long-term, but the short-term results are promising. We believe that a
full roll out of optimized service with pulse scheduling and
distribution of trains to cover non-peak times will be a successful
model and transform the transportation landscape for Southern
California.
