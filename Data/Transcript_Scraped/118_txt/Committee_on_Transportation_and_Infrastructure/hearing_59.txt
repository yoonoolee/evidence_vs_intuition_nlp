II. BACKGROUND

ABOUT PHMSA

PHMSA was created under the Norman Y. Mineta Research and
Special Programs Improvement Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-426) (2004
Act). Prior to enactment of the 2004 Act, DOT's Research and
Special Programs Administration administered the DOT's pipeline
and hazardous materials safety programs.\1\ PHMSA's mission is
to protect people and the environment by advancing the safe
transportation of natural gas and hazardous liquids through
roughly 3.4 million miles of pipelines, which account for the
transportation of 65 percent of the energy commodities consumed
in the United States.\2\ PHMSA also is charged with the safe
and secure movement of over one million daily shipments of
hazardous materials by all modes of transportation.\3\

The first statute regulating pipeline safety was the
Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, which Congress amended
in 1976.\4\ Congress added hazardous liquid pipelines to the
statute in the Pipeline Safety Act of 1970.\5\ Recent enacted
legislation regulating the safety of natural gas and hazardous
liquid pipeline facilities and that reauthorize pipeline safety
programs at PHMSA include the Protecting our Infrastructure of
Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016, and the Protecting
our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES)
Act of 2020.\6\ The current authorization for PHMSA's pipeline
safety programs expired at the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 on
September 30, 2023.\7\ The Consolidated Appropriations Act,
2024 (P.L. 118-42) provided PHMSA with $371.2 million in total
budgetary resources for FY 2024.\8\ PHMSA requested $400.6
million in its FY 2025 request.\9\

PHMSA sets Federal minimum safety standards for pipeline
safety functions, including developing, issuing, and enforcing
regulations for the safe transportation of natural gas
(including liquefied natural gas) and hazardous liquids by
pipeline through the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS).\10\
Pipelines are one of the safest and most efficient methods of
transportation for gas and hazardous liquids, and account for
some of the lowest greenhouse gas emissions in the
transportation sector.\11\ However, according to PHMSA data, in
the past 20 years 12,722 pipeline incidents, 278 fatalities,
and $11.4 billion in property damage have occurred.\12\ The
Agency's regulatory programs are focused on the design,
construction, operation, and maintenance or abandonment of
pipeline facilities, and in the construction, operation, and
maintenance of LNG facilities.\13\ PHMSA has jurisdiction over
transportation-related facilities; not drilling, siting, or
production facilities.\14\

III. H.R. 6494, THE PIPES ACT OF 2023: KEY PROVISIONS

The PIPES Act of 2023 reauthorizes PHMSA's Office of
Pipeline Safety for four years through FY 2027.\25\ The bill
supports the reliability and safety of American energy
infrastructure and PHMSA's pipeline safety mission through
rulemaking direction, studies, and programs that increase
pipeline safety, transparency, and stakeholder engagement.
These provisions will improve the performance and safety record
of the United States natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline
network.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\25\ PIPES Act of 2023, supra note 17, at Sec.  2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS AND SUPPORTING PHMSA'S MISSION

The pipeline safety program at PHMSA is responsible for
carrying out a National program to ensure the safe, reliable,
and environmentally-sound operation of the Nation's natural gas
and hazardous liquid pipeline transportation system.\26\ The
PIPES Act of 2023 supports and improves upon these efforts.
Section 24 of the bill directs PHMSA to establish a voluntary
information sharing system that encourages pipeline operators
and stakeholders to share pipeline safety data through a
confidential platform to be analyzed and reported, so that
pipeline safety lessons learned can be shared with
stakeholders.\27\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bill also works to reduce the number of excavation
damage incidents, which, according to PHMSA data, in the past
20 years accounted for over 1,400 incidents, 66 fatalities, and
$665.5 million in property damage to pipelines, representing 11
percent of all pipeline incidents.\28\ Section 18 of the PIPES
Act of 2023 updates the assessment criteria for State Damage
Prevention programs and requires adoption of leading practices
for state one-call programs.\29\ These best practices include
requiring states to limit exemptions to one-call program
participation and increasing the use of commercially available
technology to locate underground facilities.\30\ The bill
ensures PHMSA and state pipeline safety programs have necessary
resources to conduct pipeline safety oversight, including $56
million over four years for increases to state pipeline safety
program budgets.\31\

INCREASES TRANSPARENCY

The PIPES Act of 2023 works to improve pipeline safety by
promoting information sharing among pipeline safety
stakeholders. It requires PHMSA to review industry safety
standards every four years and incorporate into existing
regulations as needed and improves public access to such
standards.\32\ Section 7 of the bill directs PHMSA to report on
its inspection and enforcement priorities, as well as report on
the number of inspections completed and violations found.\33\
Section 8 of the bill requires PHMSA to provide notification to
Congress of the reasons when it does not to follow the
recommendations of the external technical safety standards
advisory committees.\34\ Further, Section 29 directs PHMSA to
assess how pipeline operators engage and share information with
the public and state or local emergency response organizations
and issue updated guidance if necessary.\35\

EMERGING FUELS AND TECHNOLOGIES

PHMSA is responsible for setting and enforcing safety
standards for the safe operation of the Nation's gas and
hazardous liquid pipelines, including those that may transport
new and emerging fuels, such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide
pipelines.\36\ As such, the PIPES Act of 2023 supports these
efforts so PHMSA can provide efficient regulatory oversight of
the transportation of any such fuels. Section 20 of the bill
requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study
existing natural gas pipelines systems that blend hydrogen at a
volume greater than five percent and use that information to
inform rulemaking if necessary.\37\ Additionally, Section 14 of
the bill requires PHMSA to study the potential and existing use
of pipelines constructed with composite materials to safety
transport hydrogen and hydrogen blended with natural gas, and
issue a rulemaking allowing for the use of such materials
following the completion of the study.\38\ Lastly, the bill
directs PHSMA to update its regulations that govern the
transportation of carbon dioxide, including the requirement
that operators utilize dispersion modeling in high consequence
areas.\39\

IV. OUTSTANDING MANDATES

Pipeline safety reauthorization legislation provides
legislative authority to the pipeline safety programs at PHMSA
and typically includes Congressional mandates to issue
regulations to improve pipeline safety. PHMSA has experienced
delays meeting the mandates included in previous pipeline
safety reauthorization laws.\40\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/2024-03/
2024%20March%20PIPES%20Act%20Chart.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The PIPES Act of 2023, permanently continues the
requirement that PHMSA publicly post the status of each
outstanding mandate and includes authorization increases to
address PHMSA's workforce needs.\41\ The current status of
outstanding mandates can be found here: https://
www.phmsa.dot.gov/legislative-mandates/pipes-act-web-chart. At
the time of this SSM's publication, PHMSA has five outstanding
rulemaking mandates from previous reauthorization laws, with
the longest outstanding mandate originating from the Pipelines
Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011.\42\

ENSURING SAFETY AND RELIABILITY: EXAMINING THE REAUTHORIZATION NEEDS OF
THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION

----------

TUESDAY, MAY 7, 2024

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous
Materials,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:21 a.m. in
room 2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Troy E. Nehls
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Nehls. The Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and
Hazardous Materials will come to order.
I ask unanimous consent that the chairman be authorized to
declare a recess at any time during today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the Members not on the
subcommittee be permitted to sit with the subcommittee at
today's hearing and ask questions.
Without objection, so ordered.
And as a reminder, if Members want to insert a document
into the record, please email it to
[email protected]
.
Before we discuss today's hearing, I would like to take a
moment to remember our colleague, Congressman Donald Payne,
Jr., who passed away a few weeks ago. It was a privilege to
work with Donald as my counterpart on this subcommittee. It was
clear to all who knew him how strong his commitment to public
service was and to his constituents. I am grateful for the
opportunity to have worked alongside Donald, especially with
his leadership in putting together our bipartisan pipeline
safety legislation. He will be deeply missed here on the
committee, and I want to send my condolences and prayers to his
family, friends, and staff as they deal with this great loss.
I will now recognize myself for the purpose of an opening
statement for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TROY E. NEHLS OF TEXAS, CHAIRMAN,
SUBCOMMITTEE ON RAILROADS, PIPELINES, AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Mr. Nehls. In today's hearing, we will examine the need to
reauthorize the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration, or PHMSA, including providing it new direction
and authority over emerging energy sources.
This past fall, myself, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member
Larsen, and Ranking Member Payne introduced H.R. 6494, the
Promoting Innovation in Pipeline Efficiency and Safety Act of
2023, or the PIPES Act of 2023. Last December, the committee
passed H.R. 6494 out of committee on a bipartisan basis. In
crafting this bill, the committee solicited input from a wide
range of parties and, in turn, received about 90 priorities, 90
of them, from Members and over 100 requests from pipeline
safety stakeholders. I am grateful for the support from members
of this committee in putting together this important piece of
bipartisan legislation.
In our country, roughly 3.3 million miles of onshore
pipelines safely and efficiently carry natural gas, crude,
hydrogen, hazardous liquids, and other energy sources vital for
our Nation's energy independence, making it of the utmost
importance for Congress to ensure PHMSA is focused on its core
mission of advancing the safe transportation of these
resources.
The PIPES Act of 2023 reauthorizes PHMSA for 4 years and
provides the necessary resources and direction for the agency
to fulfill its pipeline safety oversight responsibilities in an
efficient and effective manner. The bill contains several
provisions to accomplish this, including an authorization for
additional pipeline safety technical experts to complete
outstanding congressional mandates.
Over the past 20 years, more than 1,400 excavation damage
incidents have occurred. H.R. 6494 includes measures to
strengthen State programs to reduce the number of excavation
damage incidents, promoting the public's safety.
The PIPES Act of 2023 will also support PHMSA's efforts to
oversee the safe transportation of new and emerging fuels by
directing PHMSA to update regulations for the safe
transportation of carbon dioxide and to study the use of
hydrogen blending in natural gas. These and other provisions in
the PIPES Act of 2023 will ensure the safety and reliability of
the United States pipeline network and the transportation of
our critical energy resources.
It is more important than ever for PHMSA to receive a
regular reauthorization from Congress. This will provide both
the agency and regulated community much needed certainty in
Federal pipeline safety policy and also provide legislative
direction to addressing pressing areas of concern in pipeline
safety.
I want to thank our witnesses for being here today and
sharing their perspectives on pipeline safety reauthorization
and what it means for PHMSA, the industry, and the communities
where the transportation of our energy products take place.
I will also note that my colleagues on the House Energy and
Commerce Committee have also passed pipeline safety
reauthorization legislation through committee based on their
jurisdiction. Despite such action in the House, we have yet to
see any movement in the Senate from Leader Schumer and his
majority. As the House has shown, it is possible to legislate
in a bipartisan manner in the name of pipeline safety. I call
on the Senate to follow suit, and I hope to work with them in
the near future.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON OF FLORIDA,
RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON RAILROADS, PIPELINES, AND
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you, Chair Nehls, for holding
this hearing today. And thank you, Ranking Member Larsen, for
your faith in me.
It is with a heavy heart that I take on the role of ranking
member of this subcommittee. Congressman Donald Payne, Jr., was
not just a colleague, but a cherished friend whose legacy I am
dedicated to honoring and advancing. His exemplary leadership
on the railroad subcommittee sets a standard of excellence that
I am committed to upholding and building upon.
For many years, we were soldiers in the army to uplift
Black men and boys, whether that be Trayvon Martin or fighting
for health disparities among Black men and boys.
He fought the good fight to bring back our girls from
Africa. I sat next to him in committee for years, and we were
table-mates every year at the Congressional Black Caucus gala,
and he shared many memories with me.
He was so proud to be the father of triplets and to let me
know that he married a Florida girl.
I will miss him, and I am committed to honoring his legacy
and continuing his work on this committee.
As we all know, part of his mission was to ensure the
safety of all people, and he had a goal of never wanting to
miss a vote, regardless of his health, and speaking every day
on the floor to honor his constituents. He loved his
constituents. He was a man for all seasons, and we will miss
him dearly.
Before coming to Congress, I was a school principal, and
nothing is more important to me than the safety and education
of our children. I do not want to see any pipeline incidents,
but I am particularly concerned when they occur at or near a
school. At least two recent incidents in the last year happened
at or near schools. One was near an elementary school in
Conway, Washington, and another was at a school in the
Mississippi Delta in Merigold, Mississippi.
Yes, believe it or not, just last month in Merigold, there
was a pipeline explosion at Hayes Cooper Center, a pre-K
through eighth-grade school. Although no children were injured,
two school staff members were injured and taken to the hospital
for treatment.
I want to know how pipeline operators work with communities
and schools to prevent such incidents. Are they working with
the impacted schools for additional tutoring or student support
for those children's lost instruction time? What about their
mental health? How does having to evacuate impact students'
learning?
With regard to the PIPES 2023 bill, I supported the bill
because it has essential provisions that Mr. Payne championed,
and I associate myself with his work on these efforts. Among
them, the bill includes increased funding for the Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to support the Office
of Pipeline Safety for its critical safety mission. I am proud
that this bipartisan pipeline safety bill strongly focuses on
pipeline safety.
This bill also makes changes to the Competitive Academic
Agreement Program to provide funding for academic research and
develop the pipeline safety workforce of the future. The
changes will help most Historically Black Colleges and
Universities and other minority-serving institutions
participate in the program. These are positive changes, and I
urge Congress to adopt them.
Lastly, I want to say to Mayor Kaag of West Reading, who is
leading her city through the aftermath of the deadliest
pipeline explosion the country experienced in 2023, thank you
for watching today. I am so sorry for your loss. Seven people
died after showing up for work to make chocolate, 10 people
were injured, and I understand in your volunteer firefighting
capacity, you also showed up to help with the immediate
emergency response. We hear you, we see you, and we will never
forget.
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today, and I
yield back my time.

for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair Nehls, for
calling this hearing on pipeline safety and for your kind words
about our colleague and friend, Representative Donald M. Payne,
Jr. And we continue to mourn today after his death just 2 weeks
ago.
Don was a leader on the PIPES Act of 2023 that our
committee voted unanimously to advance in December. He strongly
supported ensuring PHMSA and the State pipeline safety programs
have the funding they need to do their work. Don also helped
lay the groundwork for strong rail funding in the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law. Because of Don's work, we will see
replacements of century-old rail bridges and tunnels on the
Northeast Corridor, including the suite of Gateway projects.
He was a friend and advocate for rail workers, supporting
their bid for sick leave, higher wages, and improved working
conditions. His efforts helped support a historic agreement
that would strengthen the safety and quality of life for
essential rail workers. Don's work to advance rail safety
legislation, especially in the wake of the derailment in East
Palestine, will remain an important part of his legacy that
Congress must continue to realize.
On June 10, 1999, an Olympic pipeline explosion in
Bellingham, Washington, in my district claimed the lives of two
10-year-old boys and an 18-year-old young man. The explosion
also released 237,000 gallons of gasoline into a creek that
flowed through Whatcom Falls Park in Bellingham. This explosion
at the time spurred my commitment, which has been steadfast for
over 20 years, to the highest level of pipeline safety. For my
entire tenure in Congress, I have fought to reduce the risk of
pipeline incidents, promote transparency of pipeline safety
information for local communities, and increase accountability
for pipeline operators.
According to PHMSA data, in the past 20 years, there have
been 12,722 pipeline incidents claiming 278 lives and causing
$11.4 billion in property damage. So, while we work on the
PIPES 2023 bill, the pipeline industry continues to experience
deadly accidents causing damage to the environment.
According to the Pipeline Safety Trust, 2023 was the
deadliest year for pipelines in two decades.
On March 24, 2023, a UGI pipeline explosion in West
Reading, Pennsylvania, killed 7 people, injured 11, displaced 3
families from a neighboring apartment building, and evacuated
many more from the area.
In November 2023, as well, Third Coast Infrastructure
released 1.1 million gallons of crude oil from an underwater
pipeline into an ``unusually sensitive area'' in the Gulf of
Mexico about 20 miles southeast of Venice, Louisiana.
More recently, in January 2024, two homes less than 1 mile
from each other in Jackson, Mississippi, exploded 3 days apart
from Atmos Energy pipeline leaks. The first home explosion
resulted in one fatality and one injury. The resulting fire
from the second explosion spread to a neighboring home. These
incidents happened after Atmos had identified leaks in their
pipelines in the area, but failed to repair them.
Putting safety first means greater oversight and
accountability of the activities of pipeline operators. It also
means greater transparency for local communities and the
public. PIPES 2023 accomplishes this by creating an Office of
Public Engagement, an idea championed by my Washington State
colleague, Representative Strickland. It requires PHMSA to
review operator emergency management response plans.
Improving safety means preventing incidents. PHMSA and the
State pipeline safety programs need the resources and staff to
inspect pipelines, conduct investigations when incidents occur,
and take appropriate enforcement actions. PIPES 2023 does this
by increasing the authorizations for both PHMSA and State
pipeline safety organizations. I am pleased that our bill
includes $56 million for State pipeline safety programs over 4
years.
I appreciate each of our witnesses being here today to talk
about the PIPES Act of 2023. I want to welcome PHMSA Deputy
Administrator Tristan Brown, who visited my district to tour
the Olympic pipeline site in Bellingham, and Bill Caram of the
Pipeline Safety Trust, whose organization was created in
response to that tragedy and is headquartered in my district in
Bellingham.
I also want to thank PHMSA and their response to the
Conway, Washington, pipeline leak that happened last year. And
cleanup continues, but nears the end for that.
In addition to its safety initiatives, the BIL created the
first-ever Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and
Modernization grant program. PHMSA has announced $588 million
for 167 projects from the $1 billion made available to
municipalities and community-owned utilities to repair or
replace natural gas pipelines and help reduce incidents and
improve safety.
Pipelines play a critical role in the Nation's
infrastructure and the daily lives of Americans. We are here
today to make sure the national pipeline network safely
delivers energy across the country.
I look forward to today's discussion.
And with that, I yield back.

Don also helped lay the groundwork for strong rail funding in the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). Because of Don's work, we will see
replacements of century-old rail bridges and tunnels on the Northeast
Corridor, including the suite of Gateway projects.
He was a friend and advocate for rail workers, supporting their bid
for sick leave, higher wages and improved working conditions.
His efforts helped support a historic agreement that would
strengthen the safety and quality of life for our essential rail
workers.
Don's work to advance rail safety legislation, especially in the
wake of the derailment in East Palestine, will remain an important part
of his legacy that Congress must continue to realize.
On June 10, 1999, an Olympic pipeline explosion in Bellingham,
Washington, in my district, claimed the lives of two 10-year-old boys
and an 18-year-old young man. The explosion also released 237,000
gallons of gasoline into a creek that flowed through Whatcom Falls Park
in Bellingham, Washington.
This explosion spurred my commitment, which has been steadfast for
over 20 years, to the highest level of pipeline safety.
For my entire tenure in Congress, I have fought to reduce the risk
of pipeline incidents, promote transparency of pipeline safety
information for local communities and increase accountability for
pipeline operators.
According to PHMSA data, in the past 20 years there have been
12,722 pipeline incidents claiming 278 lives and causing $11.4 billion
in property damage.
While we work on the PIPES 2023 bill, the pipeline industry
continues to experience deadly accidents causing damage to the
environment.
According to the Pipeline Safety Trust, 2023 was the deadliest year
for pipelines in two decades.
On March 24, 2023, a UGI pipeline explosion in West Reading,
Pennsylvania killed seven people, injured 11, displaced three families
from a neighboring apartment building and evacuated many more from the
area.
In November 2023, Third Coast Infrastructure released 1.1 million
gallons of crude oil from an underwater pipeline into an ``unusually
sensitive area'' in the Gulf of Mexico about 20 miles southeast of
Venice, Louisiana.
More recently, in January 2024, two homes less than a mile from
each other in Jackson, Mississippi, exploded three days apart from
Atmos Energy pipeline leaks. The first home explosion resulted in one
fatality and one injury. The resulting fire from the second explosion
spread to a neighboring home.
These incidents happened after Atmos had identified leaks in their
pipelines in the area but failed to repair them.
Putting safety first means greater oversight and accountability of
the activities of pipeline operators. It also means greater
transparency for local communities and the public.
PIPES 2023 accomplishes this by creating an Office of Public
Engagement--an idea championed by my colleague Representative
Strickland--and requires PHMSA to review operator emergency response
plans.
Improving safety means preventing incidents. PHMSA and the state
pipeline safety programs need the resources and staff to inspect
pipelines, conduct investigations when incidents occur, and take
appropriate enforcement actions.
PIPES 2023 does this by increasing the authorizations for both
PHMSA and state pipeline safety organizations. I am pleased our bill
includes $56 million for state pipeline safety programs over four
years.
I appreciate each of our witnesses being here to talk about the
PIPES Act of 2023.
I want to welcome PHMSA Deputy Administrator Tristan Brown, who
visited Washington's Second District to tour the Olympic pipeline site
in Bellingham, and Bill Caram of the Pipeline Safety Trust whose
organization was created in response to that tragedy and is
headquartered in my district in Bellingham. I also want to thank PHMSA
and their response to the Conway, Washington pipeline leak that
happened last year. Cleanup continues but nears the end for that.
In addition to its safety initiatives, the BIL created the first
ever Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and Modernization
grant program.
PHMSA has announced $588 million for 167 projects from the $1
billion made available to municipalities and community-owned utilities
to repair or replace natural gas pipelines and help reduce incidents
and improve safety.
Pipelines play a critical role in the nation's infrastructure and
the daily lives of Americans. We are here today to make sure the
national pipeline network safely delivers energy across the country. I
look forward to today's discussion.

Mr. Nehls. Mr. Larsen yields.
Thank you, sir. I would like to welcome our witnesses and
thank them for being here today. Briefly, I would like to take
a moment to explain our lighting system to our witnesses.
There are three lights in front of you. Obviously, green,
go; yellow, you are running out of time; and red is conclude
your marks, please.
I ask unanimous consent that the witnesses' full statements
be included in the record.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record of today's
hearing remain open until such time as our witnesses have
provided answers to any questions that may be submitted to them
in writing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 days for any additional comments and information
submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in the record
of today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
As your written testimony has been made part of the record,
the subcommittee asks that you limit your oral arguments to 5
minutes.
Mr. Brown, I appreciate you handing me the book, the ``2024
Emergency Response Guidebook,'' 2 million of these going to
first responders. Well done, but I have an issue. And before I
recognize you for 5-minute testimony, I would like to take a
moment of personal privilege.
Without objection, so ordered.
The committee notified you on April 15 of 2024--that is 21
days ago--that today's hearing was taking place. You also have
been asked for feedback on the PIPES Act far longer than that.
And we, on a bipartisan basis, re-asked for this on February 7,
so that is 90 days ago, 3 months. Yet, you were unable to
provide your written testimony to this committee in a timely
fashion, denying all of the members of this subcommittee the
ability to adequately review your testimony. Your agency was
also unable to share feedback on the bill until last night
after 10 p.m. I find it completely, completely unacceptable and
inexcusable.
Now, due to your delay on both fronts, many Members may
have questions following the hearing, as well, and I want to
make sure it expects a full answer. We want a full answer from
you to all Members' questions today.
I would also like you to commit to responding to all
Members' questions for the record. So, give me a reasonable
expectation here. Can you commit to providing an answer, what,
2 weeks, 3 weeks? Could you give me a number?
Mr. Brown. Well, as you may know, both the TA and the
testimony does go through an interagency review process, which
does take time. So, I will commit to working as fast as
possible.
Mr. Nehls. Two weeks or three weeks? Just kind of--come on,
give me an idea.
Mr. Brown. You----
Mr. Nehls [interrupting]. OK, so, we are not going to--OK,
here we go.
I look forward to your responses. We here on the
subcommittee are interested in what you have to share. You
can't come up with a time. I look forward to a productive
hearing. I hope we can have a productive hearing.
With that, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Go ahead, sir.

TESTIMONY OF TRISTAN BROWN, DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR, PIPELINE AND
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF

OPERATIONS, ENGINEERING, AND SECURITY, AMERICAN GAS
ASSOCIATION; ROBIN RORICK, VICE PRESIDENT OF MIDSTREAM POLICY,
AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE; AND BILL CARAM, EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR, PIPELINE SAFETY TRUST

TESTIMONY OF TRISTAN BROWN, DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR, PIPELINE AND
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
TRANSPORTATION

Mr. Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ranking
Member Wilson, Ranking Member Larsen, members of the
subcommittee, for the invitation to discuss the Office of
Pipeline Safety at PHMSA and our work, as well as the
reauthorization legislation that you have put together.
I just wanted to start by echoing the sentiments and
condolences to the Payne family to those of you who were
colleagues, to those of you who were friends, to the Payne
office and staff members who I know were all as saddened as I
was to learn of his passing. It is a testament to his legacy
that he worked across the aisle this past year to help advance
legislation to improve pipeline safety and to keep his
constituents and all Americans safe from hazardous materials
transportation.
As I testified last year before this subcommittee, safety
is and remains the top priority of the Department of
Transportation and of PHMSA. Specifically, PHMSA is responsible
for overseeing the safe transport of hazardous materials
through pipelines and via other modes of transportation. That's
trucks, trains, planes, vessels, automobiles, drones, among
others. We oversee the safe design, operation, and maintenance,
as the chairman mentioned, of nearly 3.3 million miles of
pipelines, as well as nearly 1 in 10 goods that are classified
as a hazardous material transported commercially in the United
States, everything from nuclear waste to lithium-ion batteries
to spacecraft being transported to spaceports around the United
States and around the world.
Nearly two-thirds of the energy we consume in the U.S. is
transported via pipeline, and over the past few decades,
especially the last few years, in conjunction with America's
red hot economic growth, energy production in the United States
has continued to increase to record levels. Concurrently, U.S.
transportation of these products has necessarily increased, and
exports of energy products have also reached record levels.
This means heightened demand on our pipelines and refined
product storage infrastructure, as well as export facilities,
liquefied natural gas terminals, which PHMSA also regulates.
The volume of work before PHMSA and the challenges in
carrying out our safety and environmental mission have never
been greater. Aging infrastructure requires more maintenance
and greater safety scrutiny. A significant portion of the
cross-country pipeline infrastructure was built shortly after
World War II, meaning pipelines are over 80 years old. There
are even a few gas distribution segments that were installed
during the Civil War era, more than 150 years ago, which,
thanks to the President's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are
finally modernizing through our first-of-its-kind, as the
ranking member mentioned, natural gas modernization grant
program that we stood up last year, which included grants in
multiple districts of multiple members of this subcommittee.
With the increasing challenges and broader demands on our
agency, clear direction and resources from Congress are
important, and particularly as we close out the final few
congressional mandates from the 2020 PIPES Act. PHMSA is
grateful for the work that this subcommittee has done in
advancing bipartisan legislation, including increased
authorization levels.
In closing, I would like to thank you again for the
opportunity to discuss with you the critical issues facing our
agency, as well as our State partners, in the largest, most
sophisticated pipeline system and hazardous materials
transportation system in the world.
Each of the areas I outlined in the written testimony are
areas in which the rest of the world looks to America for
leadership: leadership in the marketplace of products for which
we are the most efficient in the world; leadership for
establishing safety rules that countries around the world have
told me they often adopt in whole to improve their own pipeline
safety and environmental protection; leadership in the rule of
law when it comes to disputes and compliance; leadership in
research, innovation, and new technologies to improve safety
and environmental performance that are sold domestically and
exported around the world; leadership in transparency and
engagement with affected communities which other countries also
look to as a new standard; and leadership in efficiencies for
all the work that we do.
This work is the result of our collaboration with the
congressional committees that authorize and fund our agency, as
well as the stakeholders represented here. But the kudos, most
of the kudos, for all the achievements of our agency go to the
nearly 650 full-time Federal employees and nearly 200
contractors that make up what I always say is the most unsung
agency in the Government.
Thank you for your efforts to advance bipartisan
reauthorization legislation. I look forward to working with you
and your colleagues as Congress considers a pipeline safety
reauth bill and honors the efforts of your colleague, Mr.
Payne. I look forward to your questions.
[Mr. Brown's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Tristan Brown, Deputy Administrator, Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, U.S. Department of
Transportation
Introduction
Good morning, Chairman Nehls, and members of the Subcommittee. Let
me begin by expressing my sincere condolences to the Payne family, to
those of you who were friends and colleagues of Ranking Member Payne,
and to his office and staff members, who I know are all as saddened as
I was to learn of his passing. It is a testament to his legacy that he
worked across the aisle this past year to help advance legislation to
improve pipeline safety and to keep his constituents and all Americans
safe from hazardous materials transportation.
Thank you for inviting me to testify today on the U.S. Department
of Transportation's (DOT) Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration's (PHMSA) pipeline safety program. As I testified last
year before this Subcommittee--Safety is, and remains, the top priority
for DOT and PHMSA. Specifically, PHMSA is responsible for overseeing
the safe transport of hazardous materials--through pipelines and also
via other modes of transportation--aviation, rail, motor carrier, and
marine. PHMSA oversees the safe design, operation, and maintenance of
the Nation's nearly 3.3 million miles of oil, gas, and other hazardous
materials pipeline and storage facilities, including for hydrogen,
carbon dioxide, and other emerging fuels. Additionally, PHMSA's
oversight of hazardous materials transport via other modes includes
nearly 1 in 10 goods that are transported commercially in the U.S.,
everything from nuclear waste to lithium-ion batteries, to spacecraft
being transported to spaceports around the world.
Nearly two-thirds of the energy we consume in the U.S. is
transported via pipeline. Over the past few decades--and especially
over the last few years in conjunction with America's red-hot economic
growth--energy production in the United States has continued to
increase to record levels. Concurrently, U.S. transportation of these
products has necessarily increased, and exports of energy products
have--according to the Energy Information Administration--also reached
record levels. This means heightened demands on our pipeline and
refined products storage infrastructure, as well as export facilities,
such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, the safety and
environmental risks over which PHMSA also oversees.
Put simply: the volume of work before PHMSA, and the challenges in
carrying out our safety and environmental mission established by
Congress, have never been greater. Aging infrastructure requires more
maintenance, and, greater safety scrutiny. A significant portion of the
cross-country pipeline infrastructure was built shortly after World War
II--meaning many pipelines are over 80 years old. Furthermore, there
are even a few gas distribution segments that were installed during the
Civil War era, more than 150 years ago--which, thanks to the
President's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are finally modernizing
through our first-of-its kind community natural gas modernization grant
program.
With increasing challenges and broader demands on our agency, clear
direction and resources from Congress are important, particularly as we
close out the final few congressional mandates from the 2020 PIPES Act.
PHMSA is grateful for the work that this Subcommittee has done in
advancing bipartisan legislation--particularly increased authorization
levels--and I look forward to providing additional feedback on the
reauthorization needs of the agency during this hearing.
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Grant Program
After enactment of the PIPES Act of 2020, Congress also enacted the
2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. So as PHMSA has worked to implement
the 2020 PIPES Act, PHMSA has also awarded three rounds of funding for
our first-ever infrastructure grant program--a substantial undertaking
for our agency. Congress created the Natural Gas Distribution
Infrastructure Safety and Modernization (NGDISM) Grant Program,
providing $1 billion over five years to improve the safety of high-
risk, leak-prone, legacy natural gas distribution infrastructure with a
specific emphasis on benefiting disadvantaged rural and urban
communities. Municipality- or community-owned utilities are eligible,
and funds are available to these entities seeking assistance in
repairing, rehabilitating, or replacing high-risk, leak-prone natural
gas distribution infrastructure, or acquiring equipment to assist in
identifying and reducing natural gas incidents and fatalities. This
grant funding is helping communities of all sizes make their
infrastructure safer, creating good jobs, reducing heat-trapping
methane from the atmosphere, and saving residents and businesses money
on their energy bills. As previously mentioned, there is plenty of
aging infrastructure across the country that can benefit from this
program. For example, PHMSA awarded funding to multiple projects--in
both Massachusetts and Nebraska--where the pipeline systems date back
to the 1890s. Additionally, for the past two funding rounds,
Congressman Burlison's district was awarded a total of over $30 million
for the City Utilities of Springfield to acquire methane leak detection
equipment, as well as to replace over 38 miles of legacy plastic
natural gas lines and around 3,400 legacy plastic gas services and
meter sets. Communities neighboring Congressman Burchett's district
also received funds this year totaling over $4 million for pipe
replacement and equipment needs. Congressman Troy Carter joined Senator
Cassidy and me in his district to announce more than $27 million for
community owned systems throughout Louisiana last year. We have been
delighted to see the interest and excitement from grant applicants and
recipients and are happy to say that the NGDISM program is working.
During our first year of project solicitations, the program attracted
nearly $1.8 billion worth of applications for $200 million in funding.
We had similar interest when we announced the FY23 and FY24 round of
funding. This year we were able to issue grants to Texas, North
Carolina, Kentucky, and New York (among others) for the first time.
Last year we issued first-time grants to Kansas, Tennessee, Georgia,
Indiana, Massachusetts, and Florida (among many others). And this week,
we are issuing another Notice of Funding Opportunity for the FY25 round
of funding, which I know applicants are eager to apply for.
Although the program is funded through 2026, PHMSA anticipates the
work in carrying out and overseeing the infrastructure projects from
the NGDISM program won't be completed until 2033. In anticipation of
this, and to address burdens on underserved community applicants, PHMSA
has streamlined its National Environmental Policy Act review process--
establishing a first-of-its-kind, tiered approach to conduct
environmental assessments of these important projects. Utilizing the
administrative funding granted to us by Congress in the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, PHMSA took on the financial and administrative
burden of conducting a tier 1 programmatic review of potential
environmental impacts from this new grant program--instead of placing
that burden on grant recipients. PHMSA, along with our partners at the
Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in Massachusetts, as well
as the White House Council on Environmental Quality, created a tier 2
template that community grant recipients can use to identify project-
specific impacts for these pipe repair/replacement projects and
streamline the project-specific environmental review process--saving
months of time, as well as saving communities and taxpayer money that
would otherwise need to be spent on these potentially lengthy reviews.
PHMSA was honored to be asked by the White House Council on
Environmental Quality to present our work last year as an example for
other agencies to replicate to help get projects completed faster and
more efficiently, without sacrificing important environmental values.
Rulemaking
As I noted in my March 2023 testimony before this Subcommittee, our
regulatory agenda over the past several years has been extraordinarily
full. In addition to closing out a record number of long-awaited rules
related to National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and U.S.
Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommendations, and older
congressional mandates, we've also published two important new proposed
rulemakings from the 2020 PIPES Act and issued a final rule for
Periodic Updates of Regulatory References to Technical Standards and
Miscellaneous Amendments.
The 2020 PIPES Act directed us to address the methane leak
detection and repair rule, which covers both gas and hazardous liquid
pipelines, in an effort to improve public safety and protect our
environment. The broad bipartisan support in Congress for this new
directive, as signed into law by President Trump, demonstrated that
America is serious about addressing methane emissions. The private
sector has shown, too, that America is the leading innovator when it
comes to methane mitigation and we have a workforce of pipeline workers
and skilled tradesmen who are the most skilled and efficient in the
world at finding and fixing methane leaks--keeping Americans safe,
reducing harmful and costly pollution, and ultimately saving consumers
money when a valuable commodity is not leaked into the atmosphere.
The consequences of failing to address methane leaks can be tragic.
Just a few weeks ago, I joined Congressman Bennie Thompson and NTSB
Chair Jennifer Homendy for a community meeting in Jackson, MS, where
the community is still recovering from a tragic pipeline leak on Atmos
Energy Corporation's gas distribution system that led to the death of a
beloved community member, Ms. Clara Barbour. PHMSA is a party to and
supporting the NTSB's investigation into this matter. The NTSB's
preliminary report indicated that ``Before these explosions, Atmos
identified and classified leaks on their distribution system near
locations 1 and 2. The leak nearest to location 1 was discovered on
November 11, 2023, and classified as a grade-2 leak, meaning that it
was nonhazardous but would require repair in the future. The leak
nearest to location 2 was discovered on December 1, 2023, and was
classified as a grade-3 leak and therefore nonhazardous. Neither leak
was repaired before the explosions.'' In addition to PHMSA being a
party to the NTSB investigation, Atmos Energy recently, and
voluntarily, agreed to an independent safety review by PHMSA of their
processes and operations--which NTSB and our state partners are also
participating in. We anticipate sharing the results of this review with
the public.
Last May, PHMSA proposed the Gas Pipeline Leak Detection and Repair
Rule (LDAR Rule), which seeks to enhance public safety and lower
methane emissions and other air pollution by significantly improving
the requirements for the detection and repair of leaks from natural gas
distribution, gas transmission, and gas gathering pipelines. The Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) updates decades-old, Federal leak
detection and repair standards in favor of new requirements that add an
additional layer of safety by deploying commercially available,
advanced technologies to find and fix gas leaks that previously may
have gone unrepaired in perpetuity. This rule would ensure that leaks--
each of which involves a loss of pipeline integrity--are discovered and
repaired before they can degrade into more serious ruptures or
explosions and to limit the atmosphere's exposure to methane. This rule
also encourages innovation in technologies that help keep natural gas
in our pipes instead of leaking into the atmosphere, which can be
unsafe, costly for consumers, and harm our environment.
PHMSA held a Gas Pipeline Advisory Committee (GPAC) meeting on the
proposed LDAR Rule in November of 2023, and held a second public
advisory committee meeting on the proposed rule in March 2024--after
the initial meeting extended beyond the full scheduled week of day-long
discussions. PHMSA is in the process of considering and addressing all
GPAC recommendations, and will address comments received within the
comment period, prior to finalizing this rule. In addition to
discussing the LDAR NPRM at the November meeting, PHMSA also planned to
address the proposed Class Location Change rule--of interest to many
members of this Subcommittee. Due to the extended proceedings on the
LDAR rule, the Class Location Rule was taken up at the March 2024 GPAC
meeting and recommendations were completed and received from the GPAC.
At the request of many stakeholders representing entities directly
affected by the Class Location Rule, PHMSA has granted an extension of
comments for that rule, which we will review upon submission to inform
our final rulemaking.
The PIPES Act of 2020 also directed PHMSA to promptly complete the
``Safety of Gas Distribution Pipelines and Other Pipeline Safety
Initiatives'' Rulemaking. This NPRM was published in September 2023,
and received comments from over 200 commenters. The NPRM proposes to
require operators of gas distribution pipelines to update their
distribution integrity management programs, emergency response plans,
operations and maintenance manuals, and other safety practices as
envisioned in the Leonel Rondon Pipeline Safety Act, and which is
informed by NTSB recommendations aimed at preventing catastrophic
incidents resulting from overpressurization of low-pressure gas
distribution systems similar to that which occurred on a gas
distribution pipeline system in Merrimack Valley on September 13,
2018--tragically taking the life of young Leonel Rondon. In this rule,
PHMSA has also proposed codifying use of its State Inspection
Calculation Tool, which is used to help our state pipeline inspection
partners determine the base-level amount of time needed for inspections
to maintain an adequate pipeline safety program. Further, PHMSA
proposes other pipeline safety initiatives for all part 192-regulated
pipelines in this NPRM, including gas transmission and gathering
pipelines, such as updating emergency response plans and inspection
requirements. We are currently preparing for a future GPAC meeting on
that NPRM.
In addition to Congressionally mandated rules, many of PHMSA's
rulemakings underway address important recommendations from NTSB,
resulting from safety issues identified during investigations in the
aftermath of some tragic accidents. PHMSA's rules also address
recommendations from the GAO, the DOT Inspector General, and the
agency's own safety findings. As a result, PHMSA continues to work on
updates to the LNG facilities regulations, and we also recognize the
need to address emerging issues, like the design and operation of
pipelines transporting carbon dioxide in different physical states. We
understand that these priorities are in line with this Committee's
expectations, based on the Promoting Innovation in Pipeline Efficiency
and Safety (PIPES) 2023 bill that was introduced and moved through
Committee on a bipartisan basis by Chairman Graves, Ranking Member
Larsen, Chairman Nehls, and the late-Ranking Member Payne.
Enforcement and Compliance
While the number of PHMSA's administrative enforcement cases has
remained relatively steady, continued diligence of PHMSA staff to hold
responsible parties accountable has resulted in the agency setting
records for our civil penalties in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2023, PHMSA
issued over $12.5 million in proposed civil penalties against operators
who violated safety regulations. Additionally, recognizing that timely
enforcement is important to increase deterrence and shorten the time
unsafe conditions are allowed to persist, PHMSA has substantially
expedited its enforcement processes. From 2019 to 2023, for
administrative enforcement cases involving civil penalties or proposed
compliance actions, PHMSA reduced its average time to initiate and
fully close an enforcement case by approximately 40 percent.
Additionally, as a mandate of the PIPES Act of 2020, PHMSA
inspected implementation of the Act's self-executing mandate requiring
operators to update their inspection and maintenance plans to address
the elimination of hazardous leaks and minimizing releases of natural
gas (including intentional venting during normal operations) from their
pipeline facilities. In 2022, PHMSA conducted 380 inspections of
operators' plans, covering 803 PHMSA-identified pipeline inspection
systems, 39 Federally inspected gas distribution systems, 37 Federally
inspected LNG units, and 178 Federally inspected underground natural
gas storage facilities, to ensure they addressed the congressional
directive to assess the need to replace or remediate pipeline
facilities that are known to leak based on their material, design, or
past operating and maintenance history. In addition to the number of
PHMSA-performed inspections, PHMSA's state partners conducted an
additional 4,724 inspections. This is the first time PHMSA completed
inspections of each operator that it regulates within a calendar year--
and was a tremendous undertaking by our dedicated field personnel
across the country and the dedicated field personnel of our state
partners.
Additionally, sections 205(a) and (b) of the PIPES Act of 2020
directed PHMSA to assess the implementation of Pipeline Safety
Management Systems (PSMS) by gas distribution operators and provide
guidance and recommendations to encourage voluntary implementation of
PSMS by gas distribution pipeline operators. PHMSA conducted a
voluntary information collection among gas distribution operators on
the current state of PSMS implementation. To collect this data
efficiently, PHMSA designed a new information collection form and
online reporting portal. PHMSA and our state partners encouraged
operators to submit their PSMS data and, though it took longer than
anticipated, we received a statistically adequate number of responses
to allow for reasonable inference to the entire gas distribution
operator community. The accompanying report to Congress is expected to
be completed and transmitted to you and shared publicly on our website
in the coming months. In the meantime, PHMSA continues to work with
regulated entities in promoting the use of PSMS, as also directed by
section 205(c), and notes that further evaluation of PSMS frameworks
will commence following issuance of the report. It's also worth noting
that PSMS was included in a recent NTSB recommendation, so we look
forward to working with NTSB to address the relevant aspects of their
recommendation as well.
Research, Development, and Inter-Agency Efforts
While PHMSA continues to advance pipeline safety by strengthening
its regulations and enhancing its inspector training, inspections, and
enforcement programs, research and technological innovation is
essential to aid in the design, construction, operation, and
maintenance of pipelines and to address the root causes of incidents.
PHMSA's Pipeline Safety Research Program works with academia, the
regulated community, private research consortiums and Federal partners
to sponsor research and development (R&D) projects focused on providing
near-term solutions for pipeline transportation infrastructure issues
that will improve safety, reduce environmental impact, and enhance
reliability. PHMSA periodically holds public R&D forums to help
generate a national research agenda that identifies technical
challenges and fosters solutions to improve pipeline safety and protect
the environment. PHMSA's most recent forum was held in the fall of
2023, and included five working groups focusing on carbon dioxide,
hydrogen, leak detection/monitoring, threat prevention, and anomaly
detection and repair. The forum discussions regarding both carbon
dioxide and hydrogen drew extended interest as more projects are being
proposed for CCUS and hydrogen blending of natural gas pipelines. Both
of these research areas are necessary and timely as we look towards
transportation of gaseous carbon dioxide and varying hydrogen blending
of natural gas pipelines, both of which may involve additional
rulemaking efforts at PHMSA.
PHMSA issued its solicitations for its Cooperative Academic
Agreement Program (CAAP) on March 18, 2024, and it Core Program on
April 15, 2024. PHMSA's solicitation topics included Carbon Dioxide and
Hydrogen Safety, Leak Detection, Liquefied Natural Gas, Threat
Prevention, Anomaly Detection and Characterization, and Hazardous
Liquids Tanks. Based on PHMSA's review of data and trends, there is a
continued need to fund research activities intended to evaluate and
mitigate threats to prevent damage to our Nation's infrastructure. The
most present risks center around geohazard monitoring, data
integration, and corrosion control, all of which are included in the
research solicitations for 2024. Of note for the Subcommittee--PHMSA's
2023 appropriations bill directed PHMSA to utilize a significant
portion of its existing research funding as part of the creation of a
National Center of Excellence for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). PHMSA
has been working to partner with other Federal agencies in the creation
of this National Center of Excellence--to leverage broader Federal
resources to advance LNG safety.
Hydrogen/Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
In FY 2023, PHMSA awarded approximately $4 million in research
investments on hydrogen projects. Specifically, under the Core Program,
PHMSA awarded two projects: 1) to Investigate Damage Mechanisms for
Hydrogen and Hydrogen/Natural Gas Blends to Determine Inspection
Intervals for In-Line Inspection Tools, and 2) to Investigate the
Integrity Impacts of Hydrogen Gas on Composite/Multi-Layered Pipe. In
addition, PHMSA entered into an Interagency Agreement with the
Department of Energy (DOE) to ``Establish the Technical Basis for
Enabling Safe and Reliable Underground Hydrogen Storage Operations.''
PHMSA currently has twelve active hydrogen projects from FYs 2021,
2022, and 2023 awards, totaling approximately $11 million in research
investments. These projects will research how to safely transport and
store hydrogen and hydrogen blends by repurposing existing
infrastructure used for natural gas transport and underground storage,
improving hydrogen leak detection, and characterizing hydrogen specific
pipeline integrity threats.
PHMSA also collaborates with the DOE's Office of Fossil Energy and
Carbon Management to establish partnerships on R&D and safety
associated with the transport of carbon dioxide via pipelines.
Currently, PHMSA has four active projects involving the potential
impact radius for carbon dioxide, innovative leak detection methods,
and material testing and qualification for repurposing pipelines and
underground storage facilities for carbon dioxide transport and
storage. The results of these may help inform a current rulemaking
related to carbon dioxide pipelines.
PHMSA's limited funding for its Pipeline Safety-related R&D program
is divided between pipeline and LNG research. For 2023 and 2024, PHMSA
was provided $12.5 million for research, and the 2025 President's
Budget requests a total of $14 million for these important research
activities.
In terms of PHMSA's efforts on carbon dioxide (CO2) infrastructure,
while PHMSA does not have siting authority, it is PHMSA's
responsibility to help make sure that newly approved pipeline
facilities are designed, constructed, operated, and maintained with a
high level of safety. In an effort to further a one-Federal-government
approach to the oversight of decarbonization infrastructure, PHMSA
continues to seek ways to enhance its coordination with other Federal
agencies in the overall carbon capture, utilization, and storage space
to help track projects, anticipate safety and environmental risks, and
provide more public-facing information. PHMSA is in the process of
developing a specific CO2-focused website that will provide cross-
references to other agencies in an effort to help clarify the roles the
various agencies play in oversight of CO2 transportation and storage.
While most proposed CO2 pipeline projects are dense phase pipelines,
some proposals are considering converting existing natural gas
transmission pipelines to transport gaseous CO2. As noted in my
response to your letter on the subject last year, Mr. Chairman, PHMSA
is working to issue a proposed rule on CO2 pipeline safety as soon as
possible, as updated on a monthly basis in our public rulemaking chart.
Liquefied Natural Gas
Global fluctuations in natural gas supplies and its availability
continue to spark investments in LNG. Currently, there are eight LNG
export terminals with a total LNG production capacity of approximately
14 billion standard cubic feet per day (bcf/d) in the United States.
There are also 17 new facilities expected to be built within the next
five years and seven more currently seeking Federal approval, according
to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the agency which oversees
approval and siting of these facilities) \1\. As the demand is expected
to continue to increase, PHMSA continues to fund LNG safety-related
research projects; with eleven completed/closed and five currently
active projects, all totaling $5.7 million.

existing-approved-not-yet-built-and-proposed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As I noted, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 provided up
to $8.4 million to PHMSA for the creation of a National Center of
Excellence for LNG Safety (the Center), as authorized in Section 111 of
the PIPES Act of 2020. The Center aims to ensure United States remains
the leader and foremost expert in LNG operations, globally--including
safety and environmental performance, and to improve collaboration
across Federal agencies and with relevant stakeholders. For the last
few months, PHMSA has been working to engage other relevant Federal
agencies with the goal of establishing a center that leverages
agencies' expertise to address the most pressing issues and ensure we
continue to raise the bar for the global LNG sector when it comes to
safety and environmental performance. We have thus far received broad
interest from other relevant agencies.
Increased Engagement with the Public
PHMSA is committed to enhancing all stakeholder engagement and has
increased the number of public meetings and information briefings it
hosts--holding three major public meetings and information briefings in
2023, as well as the week-long November GPAC meeting that was open to
public participation. As mentioned before, in March 2024, PHMSA held
another week-long GPAC meeting that was open to public participation.
Personally, I have visited community members and victims, on-site,
where pipeline facilities have failed (e.g., Marshall, MI; Bellingham,
WA; Satartia, MS; Freeport, TX, and Jackson, MS). In March 2024, I met
with stakeholders in Bent Mountain, Virginia, near Roanoke, to listen
to concerns about the impact that the Mountain Valley Pipeline
construction project has had on their community.
PHMSA has also increased its engagement with public interest
groups, in addition to the Pipeline Safety Trust, to include pipeline
worker labor unions, and environmental groups, as well as relevant
trade associations actively participating in conferences and meetings
to hold a two-way dialogue on important pipeline safety issues,
emphasizing that pipeline safety is a shared responsibility.
In 2023, PHMSA's Community Liaisons participated in nearly 195
public meetings, events, and conferences to educate our stakeholders on
pipeline safety and damage prevention initiatives and to address
questions about the Federal pipeline safety regulations or concerns
about pipeline-related matters. Of the 195 events, 56 events were held
in transportation disadvantaged and underserved communities which
included Tribal Nations, and 16 were engagements with individual
landowners and local community representatives. In addition to engaging
with Tribal Nations to exchange information and address questions,
PHMSA continues to perform advanced communications with Tribes prior to
performing inspection activities that may take inspectors through
Tribal lands. PHMSA continues to promote the Call 811 Program through
participation in events as well as through social media and digital
campaigns encouraging safe digging practices.
With increased production and transportation of energy products, we
have also seen an increase in engagement from the public in both the
work our agency performs as well as the operations of the facilities
that we oversee. Currently, there are no requirements in PHMSA's
governing statutes for operators to engage the public with information
after a major incident occurs. This has often meant that PHMSA
personnel have had to fill the gap by explaining what our agency is
doing to address safety risks but leaving the public eager to better
understand what operators are doing to mitigate risk in the wake of an
incident. PHMSA has worked with representatives from the regulated
community, public interest organizations like the Pipeline Safety
Trust, and industry representatives from the American Petroleum
Institute to advance a recommended practice for pipeline public
engagement (RP 1185)--which was recently adopted. But more work is
necessary to ensure the public receives information about safety and
environmental risks--especially in the aftermath of a major incident.
Efficiencies in Oversight, Taxpayer Stewardship, and Focus on Employees
From 2020 to 2022, the number of PHMSA safety regulated miles for
gas distribution, gas transmission, hazardous liquids, and carbon
dioxide pipeline systems increased by 36,000 miles, and an estimated
400,000 miles of gas gathering lines are newly regulated. PHMSA also
has increasing responsibility for LNG facilities, as new facilities are
proposed and come online, and underground natural gas storage.
Consequently, PHMSA continues to strive to operate effectively and
efficiently to our expanded universe of regulated facilities. We are
grateful for the congressional authorities given in the PIPES Act of
2020 to improve efforts to attract and retain a talented pool of
professionals. PHMSA has undertaken new recruitment and retention
efforts--in coordination with the Office of Personnel Management--
including, developing new tuition reimbursement efforts and utilizing
new online recruitment methods, expanding the pool of colleges and
universities from which we recruit, engaging alma maters of our
existing team members, and broadening the public outreach of our
agency. New special pay rates for pipeline inspectors were approved in
2023 and PHMSA continues to implement programs to take advantage of all
available hiring flexibilities, to continue to try to meet Congress'
hiring directives.
Although PHMSA faces fierce hiring competition from the private
sector and other Federal agencies who are also competing with the same
limited talent pools, PHMSA is focused on increasing the number of
vacancies filled in inspection and enforcement roles. PHMSA continues
to explore ways to continue to improve the agency's hiring and
recruitment to make it both more efficient and effective in recruiting
and retaining talented applicants, including obtaining approval from
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in April 2023 of a new Special
Rate Table covering PHMSA 0801 Engineering series employees in various
locations; using Direct-Hire Authority to quickly employ qualified
candidates; and promoting the use of student loan repayment benefits,
as appropriate. Just last year, PHMSA onboarded a new Human Resources
director who has implemented several changes to attract the best
qualified candidates. PHMSA has actively used recruitment, relocation,
and retention incentives for the most qualified employees. PHMSA's
Student Loan Repayment Plan has been created and will be ready for
implementation in the next 60-days and employees have also taken
advantage of the generous student loan forgiveness program. PHMSA
employees has sent over 200 letters to their alma maters inviting their
engineering students and alumni to apply for open positions. In the
last several months, our team has engaged with the Department of
Veterans Affairs and OPM to continue to staff our positions with
veterans and their spouses. Moreover, the team has implemented a multi-
channel marketing plan that includes LinkedIn, Handshake, X (Twitter),
and email to engage with schools of engineering and college career
centers. Additionally, in the past few months, the team has visited
approximately 25 schools designated as Minority Serving Institutions
and Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and participated in
the Federal government's Workforce Recruitment Program, and other
Federal events dedicated to hiring staff with disabilities--all to
expand our pool of potential hires beyond where we've recruited
historically.
Looking Forward: Promoting Innovation in Pipeline Efficiency and Safety
Act of 2023
PHMSA has followed with interest the efforts of all of its
congressional oversight committees as they craft reauthorization
language for our pipeline safety program, and particularly the
Promoting Innovation in Pipeline Efficiency and Safety (PIPES) Act of
2023. I applaud the work of the Committee and Subcommittee leadership
and staff in working to reach a bipartisan consensus on important
safety topics that move pipeline safety, accountability, and
information sharing efforts forward.
State Oversight
As previously mentioned, our universe of pipelines that are subject
to state and Federal jurisdiction continues to expand. To accomplish an
ever-expanding mission, PHMSA relies heavily on its extremely important
partnership with state pipeline safety programs. New pipeline safety
regulations and new--or newly regulated--infrastructure (such as
certain gas gathering lines) have required state pipeline safety
programs to increase staff to handle the additional infrastructure
oversight responsibilities--or in many cases simply expanded the
obligations of existing state pipeline inspection teams, which are
already lean. These state pipeline safety programs employ approximately
450 inspectors who are responsible for inspecting over 85 percent of
the Nation's pipeline infrastructure through certification with PHMSA.
State programs experience nearly all of the same challenges PHMSA has
experienced in terms of hiring inspectors--but they usually have fewer
resources to deal with such challenges.
Therefore, as reflected in the President's Budget, we very much
appreciate the efforts of this Subcommittee to increase the vital
funding that goes to PHMSA to support state pipeline inspection
programs. While statute allows PHMSA to reimburse up to 80 percent of
the total cost of the personnel, equipment, and activities reasonably
required by the state agency for the conduct of its pipeline safety
program during a given calendar year, for fiscal years 2021 to 2023
State Base Grant Federal funding covered less than 70 percent of the
actual total state program costs. The 2023 Federal funding is estimated
to be only 56 percent of the total state program costs--due, in part,
to the increasing workload placed on states because of the increase in
regulated pipelines and expansion of pipeline safety regulations. The
2024 appropriation, consistent with the 2024 President's budget,
included an additional $21.50 million for State Pipeline Safety Grants
to increase the reimbursement rate to states to nearly 80 percent of
their pipeline safety program cost, in order to address this need and
more robustly support States' vital role in implementing many of the
new regulations previously discussed--representing a bipartisan
consensus for this need. The 2025 President's Budget once again
requests a total of $82 million for State Pipeline Safety Grants, which
would continue to reimburse state pipeline inspection programs at the
authorized level. We are very much supportive of this Subcommittee's,
and the President's, effort to increase funding to the states
commensurate with the increase in their and our oversight
responsibilities.
Resource Levels
For this same reason, PHMSA appreciates the action of this
Subcommittee in allowing an increase in personnel for the Office of
Pipeline Safety to support development and implementation of pipeline
safety policies and regulations, and to fulfill existing congressional
rulemaking mandates. As I have testified previously, it takes a broad
group of personnel to complete our rulemaking efforts, including
engineering subject matter experts but also economists, attorneys, and
environmental staff to ensure compliance with governing laws. To this
point, we have provided technical assistance asking the Subcommittee to
consider clarifying this allowance for an increase in personnel to
ensure the 30 positions specified can include the variety of experts
required to carry out our program who work at PHMSA, although they may
not be within the Office of Pipeline Safety. This is to ensure we are
authorized to hire the personnel needed to focus on the directive to
develop pipeline safety policies and regulations, and to fulfill
existing congressional rulemaking mandates.
Emerging fuels and opportunities.
As has been mentioned throughout this testimony, the anticipated
expansion of pipeline infrastructure to transport CO2 has made PHMSA's
update of current CO2 pipeline regulations a top priority for the
agency. PHMSA's proposed rule on Carbon Dioxide and Hazardous Liquid
Pipeline Safety will aim to cover operational and maintenance safety
issues relevant to different phases (e.g., supercritical, gaseous,
etc.) of CO2 transportation via pipeline--and to address each of the
issues identified by PHMSA in its investigation and enforcement
activities involving its investigation of the 2020 pipeline failure in
Satartia, Mississippi.
Additionally, PHMSA is appreciative of this Subcommittee's efforts
to understand more about the pipeline industry's use of hydrogen and
natural gas blending and the safety impact to existing gas pipeline
infrastructure. As previously noted, PHMSA has been studying this
topic, and other hydrogen blending related safety impacts for several
years, spending approximately $4 million in research investments on
hydrogen projects in 2023. Importantly, PHMSA recently published in the
Federal Register a draft information collection to allow PHMSA to
collect and identify trends related to the blending of hydrogen gas and
natural gas within gas pipelines from operator-reported data.
PHMSA understands the Committee's interest in the implementation of
a voluntary information-sharing system (VIS) comprised of PHMSA, other
Federal and state agencies, the regulated industry (i.e., pipeline and
facility owners and operators), and general public safety or
environmental advocacy organizations. The VIS concept is one that is
used successfully in other industries, particularly in the aviation
field. PHMSA has worked for years on developing a VIS concept for the
pipeline sector since the initial congressional mandate in the PIPES
Act of 2016 to study the feasibility of such a system. PHMSA looks
forward to Congress's guidance for implementing a program that seeks to
encourage collaborative efforts to improve information sharing with the
purpose of improving natural gas, hazardous liquid, and carbon dioxide
pipeline facility integrity and safety.
Conclusion: Continued Exceptional American Leadership in Pipeline
Safety
In closing, I would like to thank you again for the opportunity to
discuss with you the critical issues facing PHMSA, our state partners,
and the largest, most sophisticated hazardous materials transportation
system in the world. Each of the areas I outlined above are areas in
which the rest of the world looks to America for leadership: leadership
in the marketplace of products for which we are the most efficient in
the world; leadership for establishing safety rules, that countries
around the world have told me they often adopt in whole to improve
their own pipeline safety and environmental protection and harm
mitigation; leadership in the rule of law when it comes to disputes and
compliance; leadership in research, innovation, and new technologies to
improve safety and environmental performance that are sold domestically
and exported around the world; leadership in transparency and
engagement with affected communities, which other countries also look
to as a new standard; and leadership in efficiencies, for all the work
that we do.
This work is the result of our collaboration with the congressional
committees that authorize our agency and fund our agency, but the kudos
for all of the achievement of our agency go to the nearly 650 full-time
Federal employees and nearly 200 contractors that make up what I always
say is the most unsung agency in the Federal Government.
Thank you again for your efforts to advance bipartisan
reauthorization legislation. I look forward to working with you and
your colleagues as Congress considers a pipeline safety reauthorization
bill that honors the efforts of your colleague, Mr. Payne.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you.
Next, Ms. Sames, you are recognized for 5 minutes for your
testimony.

TESTIMONY OF CHRISTINA SAMES, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, SAFETY,
OPERATIONS, ENGINEERING, AND SECURITY, AMERICAN GAS ASSOCIATION

Ms. Sames. Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Wilson, and
members of the subcommittee, I am Christina Sames, senior vice
president for safety, operations, engineering, and security at
the American Gas Association.
Prior to AGA, I worked in research and development at
Pipeline Research Council International and spent 12 years in
public service working for DOT's Office of Pipeline Safety. I
get to officially retire next month after a 34-year career
dedicated to pipeline safety. I am proud to have made a
difference, and I guess I should thank you all for this
retirement gift of putting me in front of a hearing. Thank you.
AGA represents more than 200 utilities that deliver natural
gas to 74 million customers. Natural gas pipelines deliver
essential energy to 177 million Americans through 2.5 million
miles of pipeline system, including 2.2 million miles of local
distribution system operated by natural gas utilities. The
natural gas utility distribution pipelines are the last
critical link in the delivery chain that brings natural gas
from the wellhead all the way to the burner tip.
So, basically, AGA's members are the face of the industry.
They live in the communities that they serve. They interact
daily with their customers and State regulators who oversee
pipeline safety. And their customers are their neighbors, their
family, and their friends. As such, pipeline safety is and must
be our number-one priority.
The primary safety tool that gas distribution operators use
is DIMP, Distribution Integrity Management Program. DIMP is a
regulatory process that allows an operator to develop a safety
plan that addresses the unique operating characteristics of the
individual pipeline system and prioritizes the work to
strengthen that particular system.
Upgrading distribution pipeline systems is also an
important pipeline safety component. Currently, 43 States and
the District of Columbia have expedited pipeline replacement
programs, and in just the last 17 years, these replacement
programs have allowed operators to reduce the amount of cast
iron and bare steel by over 50 percent, replacing those lines
with plastic which will increase safety, reliability, and limit
methane release.
The natural gas distribution industry has proven it can
simultaneously increase natural gas delivery and improve
safety. But more needs to be done. AGA believes that the
provisions within the committee-passed bipartisan Promoting
Innovation in Pipeline Efficiency and Safety, PIPES, Act of
2023 will substantially improve pipeline safety by limiting
deaths, serious injuries, property damage, and environmental
impacts caused by unintended excavation damage; strengthening
criminal penalties for those who sabotage and intentionally
damage pipeline operations; studying how natural gas, hydrogen
blending, and distribution systems worldwide are safely
operated; creating a voluntary information safety system to
collect and share best practices and lessons learned with
sufficient legal and regulatory safe harbors to guarantee
industry participation; and establishing a 4-year
reauthorization period so that PHMSA and the industry have
sufficient time to complete work authorized in previous
reauthorizations.
While not in the bill, AGA strongly supports creating a
regulatory process to identify technology alternatives that, if
utilized, will meet the intent of existing pipeline safety
regulations and provide equal, if not greater, levels of
safety.
AGA and its members support fact-based, reasonable, and
practical updates to pipeline safety legislation that build
upon the lessons learned and the evolving technologies. And in
that spirit, AGA looks forward to our continued work with this
committee, as well as the House Energy and Commerce Committee
and the Senate Commerce Committee, to finalize pipeline safety
reauthorization.
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this
hearing.
I look forward to your questions.
[Ms. Sames' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Christina Sames, Senior Vice President, Safety,
Operations, Engineering, and Security, American Gas Association
The American Gas Association (AGA) is pleased to provide our input
for the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's Subcommittee on
Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials pipeline safety hearing
on May 7, 2024. AGA shares the same goals as safety advocates, the
public, pipeline sector industry partners, and Congress: Ensuring
America's pipeline system remains the safest, most secure, and most
reliable in the world. To that end, we applaud the Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee's bipartisan work to draft, negotiate, and
pass the Promoting Innovation in Pipeline Efficiency and Safety (PIPES)
Act of 2023 (H.R. 6494). We look forward to working with the Committee,
and all other House and Senate congressional partners, as pipeline
safety reauthorization makes its way through the legislative process.
AGA, founded in 1918, represents more than 200 local energy
companies that deliver clean natural gas throughout the United States.
There are more than 77 million residential, commercial, and industrial
natural gas customers in the U.S., of which 96 percent--more than 74
million customers--receive their gas from AGA members. AGA advocates
for natural gas utility companies and their customers and provides a
broad range of programs and services for member natural gas pipelines,
marketers, gatherers, international natural gas companies, and industry
associates. Today, natural gas meets more than one-third of the U.S.'
energy needs. Natural gas pipelines are an essential part of the
nation's energy infrastructure. Indeed, natural gas is delivered to
customers through a safe, approximately 2.7-million-mile underground
pipeline system, including 2.3 million miles of local utility
distribution pipelines, 100,000 miles of gathering lines, and 300,000
miles of transmission pipelines providing service to more than 189
million Americans.
Our Number One Priority: Pipeline Safety
Distribution pipelines are operated by natural gas utilities, or
``local distribution companies (LDCs).'' The gas utility's distribution
pipes are the last, critical link in the natural gas delivery chain
that brings natural gas from the wellhead to the burner tip. AGA member
utilities are the ``face of the gas industry,'' embedded in the
communities they serve, and interact daily with customers and the state
regulators who oversee pipeline safety locally. The distribution
industry takes very seriously the responsibility of continuing to
deliver natural gas to our families, neighbors, and business partners
as safely, reliably, and responsibly as possible.
The domestic shale revolution has resulted in an abundant supply of
clean, affordable, and reliable natural gas. This robust supply has
translated into stable natural gas prices and an increasing number of
utility customers who use this resource for residential and commercial
applications like cooking, space and water heating, and manufacturing.
Last year alone, natural gas utilities added 730,000 customers and
20,700 miles of pipeline to serve these new customers. Alongside this
tremendous opportunity comes the absolute necessity of operating safe
and reliable pipeline infrastructure to help ensure dependable natural
gas delivery to homes, businesses, and essential facilities like
hospitals. Every year, the industry invests $33 billion on the safety
of our natural gas pipeline systems. Unquestionably, pipeline safety is
our industry's number one priority, and through critical partnerships
with state and federal regulators, legislators, and other stakeholders,
AGA members are constantly working to improve pipeline safety,
integrity, and resiliency.
Integrity Management
LDCs use ``Distribution Integrity Management Programs'' (DIMP) to
manage systems that consist of many different types of material, of
different ages, at different pressures, and in different environments.
DIMP is a comprehensive and risk-based regulation that provides an
added layer of protection to the prescriptive federal regulations,
state regulations that go beyond federal regulations, and voluntary LDC
operated safety programs. DIMP takes into consideration the wide
differences that exist between natural gas LDCs and allows an operator
to develop a safety plan that is appropriate for the unique operating
characteristics of its individual distribution delivery system. DIMP
requires all LDCs to understand their system (design, material,
operating conditions, environment, maintenance, operating history,
etc.); manage the threats that could affect the integrity of the system
(excavation damage, corrosion, natural force damage, material defects,
etc.); assess, prioritize, and mitigate risks; evaluate and alter as
necessary program standards to ensure effectiveness; and report on
performance to regulators.
DIMP helps LDCs prioritize pipeline replacement work and other
measures that strengthen gas system safety. Industry, state regulators,
commissioners, and the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline &
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) have collectively
prioritized pipeline replacement. Currently, 43 states and the District
of Columbia have established rate mechanisms that allow operators to
replace pipe faster. As a result, in the past 17 years alone, cast iron
pipeline use has declined nearly 60 percent, and cathodically
unprotected and bare steel pipelines have decreased over 50 percent.
These systems have been replaced by modern plastic pipelines which
provide increased gas utility system safety, resiliency, affordability,
and environmental protection.
LDCs have demonstrated they can increase natural gas delivery while
simultaneously improving safety. PHMSA data shows that significant
distribution incidents, those resulting in death, injury or significant
property damage, and serious incidents, those that result in a death or
injury, have declined over the past 20 years. Significant incidents on
natural gas distribution pipelines have declined 41 percent and serious
incidents have declined nearly 47 percent. Notably, the primary cause
of these incidents is excavation damage, which accounted for 34 percent
of significant incidents and 25 percent of serious incidents in the
past 20 years. While we have seen improvement, one incident is one too
many. We look forward to working with all relevant partners to enhance
pipeline safety and further reduce incidents.
Pipeline Safety Management Systems (PSMS)
LDCs are at the forefront of voluntarily implementing PSMS, a
``Plan-Do-Check-Act'' cycle that helps operators continuously and
comprehensively track and improve their safety performance within 10
specific areas. These actions help the industry drive towards its zero-
incident goal. Operators that implement PSMS have better information on
the safety of their systems, learn where they can improve safety, and
measure their progress toward improved safety performance. Industry and
other stakeholders, including PHMSA, believe that voluntary adoption of
PSMS will enhance pipeline safety and improve safety culture. AGA
supports the voluntary adoption of PSMS and the development of systems
that promote self-disclosure and a collaborative culture between
regulators and operators. The AGA Board of Directors has recommended
that all AGA members implement PSMS in their organizations.
AGA provides various resources to help operators in their PSMS
journey. This includes a PSMS Executive Steering Committee, PSMS
Discussion Group, PSMS annual workshop, PSMS Portal which contains
materials and lessons learned from incidents and near misses, an
Operational Risk Data Committee, Quality Management technical
committee, and an annual Operations Conference. AGA also has various
initiatives related to PSMS. This includes AGA's in-person Peer Review
Program and Virtual Assessment Program which allows natural gas
utilities to observe their peers, share leading practices, and identify
opportunities to better serve customers and communities. Each review
involves AGA staff and subject matter experts from member utilities who
are dedicated to helping the host utility improve.
Demonstrated Commitment to Safety
Safety is a joint effort which engages customers, regulators, and
policymakers at every level. The natural gas industry invests over
$60,000 every minute to enhance the safety of natural gas distribution
and transmission systems. Furthermore, AGA and its member companies
have adopted a Commitment to Enhancing Safety, a public declaration
that LDC's are committed to collaborating with federal and state
officials, emergency responders, excavators, consumers, safety
advocates and the public to improve the industry's already longstanding
record of safe, reliable, and efficient operation. This document
reflects LDCs' willingness to make safety an intrinsic part of their
core business functions, including pipeline design and construction,
operations, maintenance and training, and more public facing programs
like workforce development, pipeline stakeholder engagement, and first
responder outreach. Implementing these priorities has enhanced pipeline
safety, improved LDC operations, lowered utility costs (particularly on
low-income customers), increased public accountability, and reduced
greenhouse gas emissions. Overall, our commitment underscores the steps
LDCs take every day to ensure America's 2.3 million miles of natural
gas distribution pipeline operate safely and reliably.
Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Priorities
AGA and its members support fact-based, reasonable, flexible, and
practicable updates to pipeline safety regulation that build upon
lessons learned and evolving improvements to pipeline safety and
related programs and technology. In that spirit, AGA wishes to
highlight 5 high-level principles, 4 of them included in the Promoting
Innovation in Pipeline Efficiency and Safety (PIPES) Act of 2023 (H.R.
6494), as the House-Senate reauthorization process continues.
Support Limiting Pipeline Excavation Damage Incidents (Section 18).
Excavation damage is the primary cause of distribution pipeline
incidents. According to PHMSA data, in the past 20 years, excavation
damage incidents on all pipelines have resulted in 66 deaths, 248
injuries, and $666 million in property damage. 42 of these deaths, 199
of the injuries, and $269 million in property damage was due to
excavation damages on distribution pipelines. These often tragic
incidents are preventable. States that have healthy excavation damage
prevention and enforcement programs typically experience lower rates of
damages to pipelines. AGA supports directing PHMSA to incentivize
states to adopt One Call program leading practices, derived from the
best state excavation damage programs, and condition their grants to
State One Call programs based upon adoption of these best practices. We
are confident this program will save lives.
Support Pipeline Technology Alternatives. Modern pipeline safety
technologies--not contemplated when many pipeline safety regulations
were first implemented--can, if deployed, meet the intent of these
older existing regulations and improve the overall safety of the
natural gas, hazardous liquid, underground storage, and liquefied
natural gas infrastructure. For example, satellite technology has
advanced to the point where it can be used comply with leak detection
regulation and breakaway meter technologies and excess flow valves can
stop the flow of gas if a meter is hit, eliminating the need for
physical meter protection barriers. AGA supports a PHMSA regulatory
process to identify technology alternatives that, if utilized, will
meet the intent of existing pipeline safety regulations and provide an
equal or greater level of pipeline safety. This concept is not
addressed in H.R. 6494 and we hope it will be included at a later
stage.
Strengthen Criminal Penalties for Damage to Pipelines (Section 21).
Natural gas utilities are experiencing an uptick in criminal attacks to
property, equipment and facilities. These activities range from
gunshots targeting pipeline equipment, IEDs placed on gas delivery
equipment, and the damaging of facilities and equipment necessary for
safe natural gas delivery. These activities are not only hazardous to
the safety and property of the public and member company employees,
they threaten an LDC's ability to deliver natural gas to thousands of
homes, hospitals, schools, government and military facilities, and
other critical infrastructure customers. AGA supports increased
criminal penalties on bad actors who intentionally damage, destroy or
impair pipelines and pipeline facilities, including those under
construction.
Hydrogen-Natural Gas Blending R&D Study (Section 20). Hydrogen is
an emerging solution for achieving gas LDC energy storage and
decarbonization goals. Natural gas projects in North America and
worldwide demonstrate successful blending of hydrogen into the existing
natural gas distribution network, or utilizing natural gas that has a
naturally occurring higher hydrogen content. Hawai'i Gas has
successfully utilized a natural gas hydrogen blend of 15% for decades
and many systems overseas are operating at approximately a 20% blend.
It is important to understand how companies operating natural gas
distribution systems with a higher hydrogen content are operating these
systems safely. As such, we suggest GAO conduct a review of natural gas
distribution systems worldwide that utilize hydrogen-natural gas
blending applications, or utilize gas with a higher hydrogen content,
to identify processes, materials, and standards the operators have
implemented to operate safely. The results of this study will help
underpin the safety of ongoing domestic hydrogen R&D and blending
operations.
Authorize a Pipeline Safety Voluntary Information-Sharing System
(Section 24). Congress should authorize a Voluntary Information-sharing
System (VIS) based on the recommendations of the public advisory
committee formed pursuant to the 2016 pipeline safety reauthorization
law. A VIS will engage multiple stakeholders (e.g., government,
industry, and pipeline safety NGOs) to collect and share best practices
and lessons learned, promote improved pipeline safety, and will
importantly include sufficient legal and regulatory safe harbors for
information sharing to guarantee industry participation. VIS will
support industry's implementation of Pipeline Safety Management Systems
by encouraging information sharing and facilitating understanding and
management of pipeline safety risks.
4-Year Reauthorization for PHMSA's Pipeline Safety Program (Section
2). PHMSA's Pipeline Safety program was reauthorized most recently in
the PIPES Act of 2016 and PIPES Act of 2020. With PHMSA's Pipeline
Safety program expiring again in 2023, the frequency of reauthorization
has been squeezed to just 3 years. This interval is inappropriate given
the significant time it takes to conduct studies, publish reports, and
move reauthorization priorities from legislation to Proposed
Rulemaking, address comments, and develop and publish Final Rules. In
acknowledgment of the time required to conduct studies, publish
reports, and develop a feasible, reasonable, cost effective, and
practical rulemaking (including stakeholder input), and in keeping with
reauthorization intervals that preceded the PIPES Act of 2016 (1996,
2002, 2006, 2011), Congress should reauthorize PHMSA's Pipeline Safety
program for not less than 4 years.
Conclusion
America's gas utilities' commitment to pipeline safety relies on
sound engineering principles and best in class technology, a trained
professional workforce, effective community relationships, and a strong
partnership with state pipeline safety authorities and PHMSA. As
pipeline safety reauthorization legislation is drafted this year, AGA
encourages Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to move reasonable
and consensus changes to pipeline safety law and regulation, support
PHMSA's primary role as pipeline safety regulator, and recognize the
great strides in pipeline safety engineering and operating practices
that pipeline companies are putting into practice across the country.
Pipeline sector companies and their trade associations stand ready to
assist in this process with real world operations, engineering and
safety data and experience. Please use us as a resource.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you.
Mr. Rorick, you are recognized for 5 minutes for your oral
testimony.

TESTIMONY OF ROBIN RORICK, VICE PRESIDENT OF MIDSTREAM POLICY,
AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE

Mr. Rorick. Thank you, Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member
Larsen, Ranking Member Wilson, and esteemed members of the
subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify this
morning.
I would like to start by offering my condolences on the
loss of Ranking Member Payne. My thoughts are with his family.
My name is Robin Rorick, and I am the vice president of
midstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute. On behalf
of API, we appreciate the opportunity to testify as part of
this important hearing addressing pipeline safety and the
reauthorization of the Department of Transportation's Pipeline
and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.
Every day, our Nation's network of more than 500,000 miles
of transmission pipelines transports the oil, natural gas,
refined product, and low-carbon energy that fuel American life.
America has led the world in reducing carbon dioxide emissions
over the past two decades, even as our industry has made the
United States the world's leading producer of oil and natural
gas.
The air Americans breathe is cleaner because of innovative
improvements to the way energy is produced, transported,
refined, and consumed. But we need pragmatic, bipartisan energy
policies that support the reasonable development of our
Nation's oil and natural gas resources, including policymaking
that encourages investment in critical energy infrastructure
like pipelines.
Pipelines, one of the safest, most environmentally
responsible ways to transport energy to consumers, are in every
U.S. State, and our industry is committed to zero incident
safety culture. Even as barrels delivered in pipeline mileage
continues to increase, this strong safety record is improving.
Over the last 5 years, total liquid pipeline incidents
decreased 23 percent, with 87 fewer incidents in 2023 compared
to 2019, while incidents impacting people or the environment
decreased 7 percent. We welcome effective policymaking to
continue to build upon this progress and further improve
pipeline safety.
We applaud this committee's passage of a comprehensive
bipartisan bill, the Promoting Innovation in Pipeline
Efficiency and Safety, or PIPES, Act of 2023. The bill the
committee passed in December of last year contains many
important policy measures that API is confident will make our
Nation's pipeline network safer and more reliable.
In particular, we are pleased the bill requires PHMSA to
execute a more timely and frequent review process for industry
standards that are incorporated by reference into PHMSA
regulations. There are more than 650 references to API
standards in Federal regulations. These standards are revised
and improved every 5 years, at a minimum, through API's
American National Standards Institute-accredited process, and
regulators struggle to keep pace with the advances in pipeline
safety, technology, and modern engineering practices that are
regularly incorporated into these standards.
Today, approximately 50 percent of the instances where
PHMSA cites API standards are out of date and do not reference
the most recent edition. If passed, this bill would ensure that
PHMSA is responsive to industry standards updates to maximize
safety and ensure regulations keep pace with advances in
engineering and technology.
The bill also directs the Secretary of Transportation to
allow pipeline operators to establish storage tank inspection
frequency on risk-based engineering principles, advances
pipeline safety through the creation of a voluntary
information-sharing system, strengthens protections for
pipeline infrastructure by criminalizing activities that cause
a defect in or disrupt operation of a pipeline, and encourages
innovation and investment in a cleaner energy future by
requiring PHMSA to promulgate rulemakings for CO2 pipelines, as
well as the safe use of composite pipe materials.
The bill also recognizes the important conservation efforts
that pipeline operators have embraced.
API believes this bill would make our Nation's pipelines
safer and more reliable, but we know you share jurisdictions
with other committees, and conversations on reauthorization are
ongoing. We urge you to continue advocating for the provisions
I have mentioned, but also to consider supporting language
introduced by other committees that would reauthorize the
technology pilot program and provide clarity as to what agency
regulates in-plant piping at refineries.
As a final matter, our industry is actively engaged in the
regulatory process to help PHMSA craft a workable final leak
detection and repair rule, but we believe the initial proposal
went beyond the scope of what Congress intended. We appreciated
the letter Chairman Graves and Chairman Nehls sent to PHMSA
last year, raising many similar concerns. And as we await the
final rule, I urge you to continue to conduct oversight of this
process. This rulemaking demonstrates the significance and
impact of the reauthorization process, and we appreciate the
opportunity to participate in the discussion of the bill on the
table today.
In closing, let me stress that pipeline safety is not a
partisan issue, and our industry needs effective legislation to
meet the challenge of answering ever-growing energy demand
while advancing safety and leading the world in emissions
reductions. API appreciates the opportunity to engage in
today's hearing and the committee's important work to advance a
bipartisan pipeline safety bill.
Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Larsen, Ranking Member
Wilson, and members of the subcommittee, this concludes my
prepared statement, and I look forward to the conversation that
we are going to have today.

Prepared Statement of Robin Rorick, Vice President of Midstream Policy,
American Petroleum Institute
Introduction
Chairman Graves, Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Larsen and esteemed
members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify
this morning. My name is Robin Rorick, and I am the Vice President of
Midstream Policy at the American Petroleum Institute (API). On behalf
of API \1\, we appreciate the opportunity to submit testimony as part
of this important hearing addressing pipeline safety and the
reauthorization of the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ API represents all segments of America's oil and natural gas
industry, which supports more than 11 million U.S. jobs and is backed
by a growing grassroots movement of millions of Americans. Our nearly
600 members produce, process, and distribute the majority of the
nation's energy, and participate in the API Energy Excellence 
program, which is accelerating environmental and safety progress by
fostering new technologies and transparent reporting. API was formed in
1919 as a standards-setting organization and has developed more than
800 standards to enhance operational and environmental safety,
efficiency, and sustainability. Through the API Climate Action
Framework and related initiatives such as The Environmental
Partnership, significant efforts are being conducted by the oil and
natural gas industry to balance the increasing demand for affordable
and reliable energy products with environmental performance and
stewardship.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every day, our nation's network of more than 500,000 miles of
transmission pipelines transports the energy products we rely on. The
oil, natural gas, refined products and low carbon energy transported by
pipelines fuel modern life. America has led the world in reducing
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over the past two decades--even as our
industry has made the United States the world's leading producer of oil
and natural gas. The air Americans breathe is cleaner because of
innovations to the way energy is produced, transported, refined and
consumed. These improvements have driven significant declines in
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and criteria air pollutants, including
nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. We are also
tackling the methane challenge head on. But we need pragmatic,
bipartisan energy policies that support the responsible development of
our nation's oil and natural gas resources, including policymaking that
encourages investment in critical energy infrastructure like pipelines.
Fully harnessing American energy, including bringing the benefits
of oil, natural gas and low carbon energy to all parts of the country,
depends on new and existing infrastructure. Pipelines--one of the
safest, most environmentally responsible ways to transport energy to
consumers--are in every U.S. state, totaling roughly three million
miles of largely underground gathering, transmission and distribution
pipelines. Our industry is committed to achieving an operating standard
of zero incidents through comprehensive safety management systems and
robust safety programs, including the deployment of advanced inspection
and leak detection technologies. Over the last five years, total
liquids pipeline incidents decreased 23%, with 87 fewer incidents in
2023 compared to 2019, and liquids pipeline incidents impacting people
or the environment decreased seven percent. Operations and maintenance
incidents impacting people or the environment declined 54% between 2019
and 2023. Total equipment failure incidents impacting people or the
environment decreased 50% between 2019 and 2023. These safety
improvements come as our country has built more pipelines and moved
more energy resources, with liquids pipeline mileage and barrels
delivered both increasing five percent since 2018.\2\ As our industry
continues to work with federal, state and local policymakers and
regulators to protect the environment and communities where we live and
work, we welcome effective and efficient policymaking to help
continuously improve pipeline safety while unleashing the power of
America's oil and natural gas.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
API Applauds the Bipartisan PIPES Act of 2023
As Congress considers the reauthorization of PHMSA and pipeline
safety programs over the coming year, we encourage policymakers to
enact legislation that maximizes our industry's investments in people
and technology to effectively advance pipeline safety. To that end, we
applaud this Committee's passage of a comprehensive, bipartisan bill,
the Promoting Innovation in Pipeline Efficiency and Safety (PIPES) Act
of 2023.The bill the Committee passed in December of last year contains
many important policy measures that API is confident will make our
nation's pipeline network safer and more reliable.
Importantly, the bill requires PHMSA to execute a more timely and
frequent review process for industry standards that are incorporated by
reference into PHMSA regulations. Since 1924, API has been the leader
in developing voluntary, consensus-based, internationally recognized
standards covering all segments of the oil and natural gas industry.
Our standards are the most widely cited petroleum industry standards by
state regulators, with 240 API standards cited over 3,800 times in
state-based regulations. There are more than 650 references to API
standards in federal regulations.\3\ These standards are revised and
improved every five years at a minimum through API's American National
Standards Institute-accredited process, and regulators struggle to keep
pace with the advances in pipeline safety technology and modern
engineering practices that are regularly incorporated into these
standards. Today, approximately 50% of the instances where PHMSA cites
API standards are out of date and do not reference the most recent
edition. Thus, critical regulations do not reflect advances in safety,
technology and engineering, and pipeline operators must comply with the
often-antiquated practices referenced in federal regulations. If
passed, this bill would ensure that PHMSA is responsive to industry
standards updates to maximize safety and ensure regulations keep pace
with advances in engineering and technology.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ OGP Report No. 426, Regulators' Use of Standards, March 2010
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bill also directs the Secretary of Transportation to allow
pipeline operators to establish storage tank inspection frequency on
risk-based engineering principles. Current regulations cite outdated
practices and industry standards, requiring internal inspections to be
conducted more often than may be necessary to maintain them safely.
This unnecessarily puts workers in harm's way, generates undesirable
emissions, requires operators to take tanks out of service and fails to
reflect current industry leading approaches. Directing PHMSA to update
its regulations concerning tank inspections will maintain the current
level of safety while minimizing safety risks for workers and
environmental impacts.
The legislation will also help improve pipeline safety through the
creation of a voluntary information-sharing system operators can use to
gather incident data and share lessons learned in a confidential
environment. We appreciate the information protections established in
the bill, which are critical to encourage operator participation, so
the voluntary system can function as Congress intends. The Act also
strengthens protections for pipeline infrastructure by criminalizing
activities that cause a defect in or disrupt operation of a pipeline.
Finally, the bill encourages innovation and investment in a cleaner
energy future by requiring PHMSA to promulgate a rulemaking within one
year of enactment on pipeline transportation of carbon dioxide, which
is critical to our energy future, and directing PHMSA to complete a
study and rulemaking on the safe use of composite pipe materials. The
unique properties of composite pipeline materials could be useful for
retrofitting existing systems for conversion of service from
transporting hydrocarbons to new fuels as well as to support the
buildout of new infrastructure, but PHMSA must allow for broader
acceptance and application without requiring use of the special permit
program. We commend the Committee for taking these critical steps.
In addition to these important pipeline safety policy measures, API
appreciates the Committee's recognition of the important conservation
efforts that pipeline operators have embraced. Many API members are
using non-traditional methods, such as conservation and habitat
management programs, to support pollinators and native species while
maintaining their pipeline rights of way. Clarifying in statute that
these alternative approaches to maintaining pipeline rights of way are
safe and encouraged could lead to broader adoption.
Proposals to Further Improve Safety and Reliability
This legislation is a strong starting point, but we also encourage
members of this Committee to consider supporting additional provisions
as you work towards final passage of a bill. In particular, we would
like to note two provisions that are included in other pipeline safety
legislation passed by your counterparts at the Energy and Commerce
Committee, which we believe will complement your draft bill and work to
improve pipeline safety.
API encourages this Committee to consider supporting language
clarifying who has jurisdiction over short segments of pipe within gas
processing and refining facilities, also known as ``in-plant'' piping.
These pipelines are operated by plant personnel, run between facility
buildings and are less than one mile in length. Liquid in-plant piping
is regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) through its Process Safety Management program as directed by
Congress in statute. However, Congress failed to provide similar clear
instructions when it comes to gas in-plant piping. Historically, PHMSA
has deferred to OSHA as the primary regulator given its expertise on
the liquid side, but the lack of statutory clarity has created a vacuum
that certain regional PHMSA offices have tried to exploit to expand
their jurisdiction. This regulatory grey area has led to confusion
among pipeline operators who need certainty when it comes to what
standards apply and what inspection schedule to follow. We recommend
the Committee create an exemption for gas processing facilities that
mirrors the one for liquid pipelines to provide operators with
regulatory certainty and consistency while still ensuring safety.
API also urges this Committee to support efforts to reauthorize
PHMSA's technology pilot program, which was created by the PIPES Act of
2020. The program was intended to give operators a chance to
demonstrate and apply proven technologies and engineering practices
through a time limited process distinct from the special permit
program. Unfortunately, no operators have applied since the program was
created because PHMSA imposed numerous application requirements that
made the process too burdensome to warrant participation. Reauthorizing
the program with clarifying language to ensure it is run as Congress
intended and gives operators the opportunity to prove the use case for
new technologies could produce significant safety benefits by proving
out new technologies for broader use.
As the Committee works with other authorizers towards a final bill,
we encourage you to support inclusion of these important provisions
that would complement your bill.
Related Critical Pipeline Safety Issues
As Congress considers legislation to reauthorize PHMSA, we urge
this Committee to conduct diligent oversight of the agency's efforts to
issue new regulations related to leak detection and repair (LDAR). In
particular, ensuring PHMSA conducts a thorough analysis of the costs
and benefits of its regulations is critical to sound policymaking.
While API supports PHMSA's goal of addressing methane emissions--our
industry is constantly innovating and investing in new technologies to
prevent leaks and reduce our emissions--we believe the current proposed
rule was written such that the benefits in certain instances do not
justify the costs. Our industry is actively engaged in the regulatory
process to help PHMSA craft a workable final LDAR rule that is more
effective and efficient by considering the latest technology and
management systems to reduce emissions. However, as written, there are
significant hurdles that must be overcome to reach that result.
This rulemaking is a direct result of the Protecting Our
Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act, a
pipeline safety bill Congress passed in 2020. Unfortunately, PHMSA
chose to go beyond the scope of what Congress originally intended by
extending the application of LDAR requirements to gas gathering lines
in Class 1 locations and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities,
setting the leak detection threshold so low as to risk being triggered
by emission sources unrelated to the pipeline system.
PHMSA's attempt to expand their proposed LDAR rule to include
gathering lines illustrates the importance of PHMSA conducting accurate
cost-benefit analyses. In the rulemaking process, PHMSA relied on a
flawed cost-benefit analysis that failed to include significant
compliance costs that would be imposed on the industry resulting in a
highly inaccurate justification for the proposed rule. If enacted,
these regulations would result in limited emissions reductions in
comparison to the billions of dollars in compliance costs on the
gathering line industry, costs disproportionately borne by small
companies that operate some of the lowest risk pipelines in the U.S.
API supports the agency's desire to make gathering lines safer, but
PHMSA should be obligated to consider more practical alternatives that
would still achieve the stated pipeline safety objectives and would
remain true to Congressional intent. Section 113 of the PIPES Act of
2020, which directed PHMSA to issue an LDAR rule, does not apply to
Type C gathering lines in Class 1 locations. These gathering lines only
recently became subject to the basic leak survey and repair
requirements in Part 192. API remains committed to maintaining
gathering line safety through a risk-based approach, but we believe the
decision to include gathering lines in the LDAR rule was premature and
goes beyond the scope of what Congress directed the agency to do in the
PIPES Act of 2020. In addition to failing to consider all the rule's
costs, PHMSA failed to demonstrate any benefits that could justify some
portions of the rule. PHMSA has not offered a legitimate safety or
environmental rationale for establishing a highly conservative and
overly burdensome leak detection threshold that could potentially be
triggered by non-pipeline, human-caused sources of emissions. This
dovetails with PHMSA's decision to conflate all leaks with hazardous
leaks. The proposed leak detection standards impose a detectability
threshold far more conservative than comparable EPA requirements under
the New Sources Performance Standards, prohibit the use of many proven
technologies and do not advance safety or environmental protection.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ As explained in the comments submitted by API and other
industry stakeholders, PHMSA's preliminary risk assessment for the LDAR
rule contains many of the same defects that led to the invalidation of
the rupture-mitigation valve requirements for gathering lines in GPA
Midstream Ass'n v. United States Dep't of Transp., 67 F.4th 1188 (D.C.
Cir. 2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHMSA' s current efforts to promulgate an LDAR rule provide
multiple lessons for its authorizing Committees to consider as work
continues on a reauthorization bill. PHMSA has held two meetings of its
Gas Pipeline Advisory Committee to discuss this important rule, but
industry has seen little indication that the final rule will take into
account the feedback that API and other stakeholders provided to make
the final rule more aligned with the agency's statutory mandate. It is
vital that Congress offers as much clarity as possible for PHMSA when
directing them to issue regulations to ensure that the final outcomes
are achievable and implementable. In addition, PHMSA must continue to
be held accountable for complying with the cost-benefit requirements
included in the risk assessment provision of the Pipeline Safety Act to
ensure the agency's rulemakings are implementable and achieve the
intended improvements in safety.
With the LDAR example in mind, API urges the Committee to pay close
attention to the agency's CO2 pipeline safety proposal, which is
currently under review at the Office of Management and Budget. Your
bill includes important guidance and guard rails for the contents of
such a rule, but it appears likely that PHMSA will publish an NPRM
prior to passage of the bill.
Currently, there are more than 5,000 miles of CO2 pipeline
nationwide, transporting approximately 80 million metric tons of CO2
each year. Industry has been operating CO2 pipelines safely for more
than four decades, with no fatalities associated with a CO2 pipeline
incident. This safety record is possible because of the comprehensive
existing regulatory framework for CO2 pipelines. 49 CFR Part 195
regulates the design and construction, operation and maintenance, and
corrosion prevention and mitigation of supercritical CO2 pipelines. In
addition to these regulations, there are many existing industry
standards and response guidance documents that can be applied by CO2
pipeline operators. Last year, API and the Liquid Energy Pipeline
Association, with input from the National Association of State Fire
Marshals, published an emergency response guide for first responders.
Research and standards development are ongoing as industry looks to
build out CO2 pipeline infrastructure to help reach climate goals.
Given CO2 pipelines' safety record and the robust existing body of
regulations and best practices, API recommends that this new rulemaking
focus on expanding the existing regulatory program to encompass gas
phase transportation of CO2 as well as supercritical. PHMSA should also
ensure that the rule is technically feasible, risk based and scalable
to reflect the diverse range of CO2 pipeline projects and applications
that operators are considering.
Carbon capture and sequestration will play a critical role in
reducing emissions and meeting climate goals. Pipelines to transport
captured CO2 will be integral, and PHMSA's rulemaking should support
rather than hinder the buildout of additional infrastructure. API will
provide comments and engage in the rulemaking process, and we urge
PHMSA's authorizing committees to engage in this process as well to
ensure the rule is fit for purpose and aligns with policymakers' goals.
Safely Maintaining America's Energy Leadership
The United States is now the largest producer of oil and natural
gas, which are critical energy resources here at home as well as for
our allies abroad. And we continue to lead the world in reducing
emissions.
These advances come not from government intervention but through
industry innovation and investment. For America to seize upon this
moment of energy leadership with its abundant natural resources,
Congress must enact pipeline safety policy that is fit-for-purpose and
based on sound science and engineering principles. Pipelines are an
essential cog in the energy supply chain. They have enabled our
country's record-breaking energy production by transporting oil,
refined products, low carbon energy sources and natural gas in one of
the safest and most environmentally friendly modes possible. While the
industry is proud of its safety record, it remains committed to
continual safety improvements as it strives to meet the shared goal of
zero incidents.
Pipeline safety is not a partisan issue, and API is eager to
partner with legislators and regulators at both the state and federal
levels to ensure pipelines are regulated effectively and operated
safely. Importantly, though, any regulations must be balanced to ensure
that the industry can achieve these objectives while continuing to
bring affordable, reliable energy to American families and businesses
to meet growing energy demand, support our domestic economy and provide
good-paying jobs. Only with effective legislation like the Promoting
Innovation in Pipeline Efficiency and Safety Act of 2023 can our
industry meet the dual challenge of answering ever-growing energy
demand while leading the world in emissions reductions.
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member and distinguished members of the
Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement. I look forward to
the continued bipartisan efforts to address critical issues of pipeline
safety that I have outlined today, and I would be happy to answer any
questions you may have at this time.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you.
Mr. Caram, you are recognized for 5 minutes for your
testimony.

TESTIMONY OF AND BILL CARAM, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, PIPELINE
SAFETY TRUST

Mr. Caram. Thank you, Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member
Wilson, Ranking Member Larsen, and members of the subcommittee,
for inviting me to speak today.
I also want to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of
Ranking Member Payne. Representative Payne was a great leader
with whom I feel lucky to have worked. He will be missed, and
my heart goes out to his family, friends, and colleagues.
My organization was formed after the Olympic pipeline
tragedy stole the lives of three boys in Bellingham,
Washington, in 1999. The U.S. Justice Department was so aghast
at the negligence of the pipeline company and the lack of
oversight from the Government that they asked the courts to set
aside money from the settlement to create the Pipeline Safety
Trust as an independent national watchdog. Our vision is for no
other community to endure the senseless grief that Bellingham
had to experience from a pipeline tragedy, though sadly, there
have been many pipeline tragedies and disasters since
Bellingham.
Since this subcommittee held its last pipeline safety
hearing about 14 months ago, 24 people have died from pipeline
failures in the United States. In fact, 2023 was the deadliest
year for pipeline safety in America in at least a decade. I
stated before this subcommittee that we were not making
progress on pipeline safety, and I repeat that statement today.
Total fatalities, total incidents, and significant incidents
show a statistically flat trend line with no real progress. I
would like to share a few stories of recent pipeline failures
that highlight some of the roadblocks towards safer pipelines.
In Bellingham, Washington, we are planning, along with the
families of the three boys who died in the Olympic pipeline
tragedy almost exactly 25 years ago, a commemoration of that
horrendous day. Just a few months ago, amid this planning, the
pipeline failed again, this time spilling 25,000 gallons of
gasoline just 500 feet from an elementary school. Thank
goodness it wasn't during school hours and didn't ignite. The
failure was likely due to corrosion, which an effective
integrity management program should eliminate.
Over the past 20 years, regulators and industry have
focused on reducing failures through integrity management in
high-consequence areas. The theory is sound: focus efforts
where the most harm to people and the environment could occur
by identifying all potential risks in those areas, and mitigate
those risks. Unfortunately, integrity management programs do
not seem to have lived up to their promise. Incident rates
within high-consequence areas are as high or higher than those
outside HCAs.
Just last month, the same carbon dioxide pipeline that
ruptured in Satartia, Mississippi, and sent nearly 50 people to
the hospital in 2020 failed again, this time in Sulphur,
Louisiana. Luckily, this happened when residents who live less
than 500 feet from the failure were not home, or this could
have been another tragic story. It took Denbury, now owned by
ExxonMobil, more than 2 hours to arrive and close the manual
valves, which is entirely too long.
Beyond the regulatory shortfalls of carbon dioxide
pipelines, which I included in my previous testimony, this
incident raises another important pipeline safety priority:
rupture mitigation valves and the ability to promptly close
valves. The NTSB began calling for rupture mitigation valves in
1970, continuing with a formal recommendation after the fatal
PG&E pipeline tragedy in San Bruno, California, in 2010, and
that recommendation remains open today because PHMSA is unable
to require existing pipelines to upgrade their equipment due to
congressional limitations.
Congress needs to require operators to install these valves
in high-consequence areas. There have been many pipeline
failures turned to tragedies by an operator's inability to
close valves promptly.
And just weeks after last year's hearing on pipeline safety
before this subcommittee, a pipeline explosion at a chocolate
factory in West Reading, Pennsylvania, killed 7 people,
hospitalized 11. According to a preliminary report by the NTSB,
the point of failure was likely a service tee made from DuPont
Aldyl A plastic. The NTSB published a report highlighting
problems with Aldyl A plastic service tees in 1988. PHMSA
listed these problematic components in a voluntary advisory
bulletin in 2007. At what point do we go beyond voluntary
recommendations and make it explicitly illegal for this
material to be part of our Nation's pipelines?
The common theme among the pipeline disasters I have shared
today is Congress and the regulators leaving too much up to
voluntary or performance-based efforts. It is important to
offer flexibility to enable industry leaders to make new
advancements. However, the regulations also need to ensure that
the entire industry is operating safe pipelines.
Please remember the 24 people who have died from pipeline
failures since the last time I testified before this
subcommittee 14 months ago, and think of the empty seats at
their family dinner tables. I can tell you from working with
the families in Bellingham who lost their sons in 1999, the
pain never goes away. Thank you.
[Mr. Caram's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Bill Caram, Executive Director, Pipeline Safety
Trust
Good morning, Subcommittee Chair Nehls, Committee Chair Graves,
Committee Ranking Member Larsen, and members of the Subcommittee. Thank
you for inviting me to speak today on the vital subject of pipeline
safety. My name is Bill Caram, and I am the Executive Director of the
Pipeline Safety Trust.
I want to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of Ranking
Member Payne. Representative Payne was a great leader with whom I feel
lucky to have worked. He will be missed, and my heart goes out to his
family, friends, and colleagues.
The Pipeline Safety Trust was created after the Olympic Pipe Line
tragedy in Bellingham, Washington in 1999. That entirely preventable
failure spilled nearly a quarter-million gallons of gasoline into a
beautiful salmon stream in the heart of our community which eventually
ignited and killed three boys. The U.S. Justice Department was so
appalled at the operations of the pipeline company and equally appalled
at the lax oversight from the federal government, that they asked the
federal courts to set aside money from the settlement to create the
Pipeline Safety Trust as an independent national watchdog organization
over the pipeline industry and its regulators.
We work to ensure that no other community must endure the senseless
grief that Bellingham has had to experience from a pipeline tragedy.
Sadly, there have been many senseless pipeline tragedies and disasters
since Bellingham. I am here today, hoping that we can continue to work
together to help move towards our shared goal of zero incidents.
Since this subcommittee held its last pipeline safety hearing,
about 14 months ago on March 8, 2023, at least 23 people have died from
pipeline failures in the United States. In fact, 2023 was the deadliest
year for pipeline safety in America in 20 years. I stated before this
subcommittee 14 months ago that we were not making progress on pipeline
safety, and I repeat that statement today.
[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

While everyone on today's panel supports the goal of zero
incidents, unfortunately, we have a long way to go. Total fatalities
for all systems show a mostly flat trend line going down very slightly.
Total incidents for all pipeline systems also show a trend line going
down very slightly--a basically flat line with no real progress over
the past thirteen years.
Filtering for only those incidents deemed ``significant'' by PHMSA,
we see a trend that is slightly increasing. For all the progress the
industry touts on technological advancements and safety management
systems, we are not moving towards our target of zero incidents.

Also of concern is the fact that approximately two-thirds of all
incidents and significant incidents are from causes that are under the
operator's direct control such as corrosion, incorrect operations,
equipment failures, and problems with materials, welds, and equipment.

I'd like to share a few stories of recent pipeline failures, each
of which occurred after the last Subcommittee hearing on pipeline
safety March 8, 2023, that highlight some of the roadblocks toward
safer pipelines.
Olympic Pipeline Spill in Conway, WA
A failure of Integrity Management
In my town of Bellingham, WA, the community, along with the
families of the three boys who died in the Olympic pipeline tragedy 25
years ago, are planning a remembrance of that horrendous day--June
10th, 1999. And just a few months ago, the pipeline failed again, this
time spilling 25,000 gallons of gasoline, just 500 feet from an
elementary school and into a tributary of a critical salmon river.
Thank goodness it wasn't during school hours and didn't ignite. This
failure was likely due to corrosion, a cause that an effective
integrity management program is supposed to eliminate.
Over the past twenty years, regulators and industry have focused on
reducing pipeline incidents through Integrity Management (IM) in High
Consequence Areas (HCAs). The theory behind Integrity Management
programs makes perfect sense--focus efforts in those areas where the
most harm to people and the environment could occur, identify all
potential risks in those areas, put into place programs to test for and
mitigate those risks, and implement a continuous improvement program to
drive down the number of failures.
Unfortunately, for both hazardous liquid and gas transmission
pipelines these Integrity Management programs do not seem to have lived
up to their promise. Incident rates within High Consequence Areas as
compared to outside HCAs continue to climb in the case of hazardous
liquid pipelines and generally do no better with regards to gas
transmission pipelines. However, it's important to note that 2023 was a
very strong year for gas transmission pipeline safety in HCAs and we
hope this is the start of a string trend. However, one year does not
yet make a trend. These two graphs, generated from PHMSA's Integrity
Management Data, demonstrate our concern with current IM programs. Some
in the industry argue that older, prescriptive class location rules can
now be relaxed because of the implementation of Integrity Management,
but as the graphs show: It is too early to go to a performance-based
Integrity Management system until the industry can prove that Integrity
Management works as it should over a meaningful length of time.

Denbury/ExxonMobil Carbon Dioxide Pipeline in Sulphur, LA
Require prompt closure of valves
Just last month, the same carbon dioxide pipeline that ruptured and
sent nearly 50 people from the town of Satartia, MS to the hospital in
2020 failed again. This time, in Sulphur, LA. Luckily, this happened
during the day and the residents who live less then 500 feet from the
failure site were not home or this could have been another tragic
story. According to initial reports Denbury was unaware of the failure.
It was the residents in the area who discovered the plume. It took
Denbury, now owned by ExxonMobil, more than two hours to arrive on site
and close the manual valves, which is entirely too long. A shelter-in-
place order was largely communicated via Facebook. We hoped that
Satartia would be a wake-up call for Denbury, but initial reports from
Sulphur show many operational shortcomings have not yet been addressed
to ensure the safety of those who live around its pipelines.
Beyond the regulatory shortfalls of carbon dioxide pipelines which
I included in my previous testimony, this incident raises another
important pipeline safety priority--Rupture Mitigation Valves (RMVs)
and an operator's responsibility to promptly close valves and shut in a
pipeline in and near High Consequence Areas (HCAs). The NTSB began
calling for rupture mitigation valves in 1970.\1\ It continued with a
formal recommendation \2\ after the investigation into the fatal PG&E
pipeline tragedy in San Bruno, CA in 2010. That recommendation remains
open \3\ because PHMSA is unable to require existing pipelines to
upgrade their equipment due to Congressional limitations. There have
been countless pipeline tragedies and disasters made worse by an
operators' inability to close valves and shut-in the pipeline quickly.
While PHMSA now requires new and replaced pipelines to have RMVs, it is
the existing, aging pipelines that need this safety technology the
most.

A recent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
(National Academies) report recommended PHMSA leave the decision up to
operators' Integrity Management (IM) programs. With due respect for the
National Academies Committee and its process and rigor, I believe this
gives the effectiveness of IM programs too much credit and it's time to
set a definitive standard. The National Academies report points out
many of the shortcomings of IM under the current regulatory regime yet
does not convince me that the suggested improvements would lead to
better results with regard to RMVs. I believe the best path forward
towards safety involves requiring operators to install RMVs in and near
HCAs. In cases where that might not be practical, establishing a
minimum requirement that the operator demonstrate the ability to close
valves within 30 minutes of a failure. Looking back at some of the
worst pipeline tragedies and disasters in recent history, this safety
standard would have gone a long way in mitigating the loss and damage
suffered.
UGI Utilities Factory Explosion in West Reading, PA
Ban problematic materials
Just weeks after last year's hearing on pipeline safety before this
subcommittee, an explosion at a chocolate factory in West Reading,
Pennsylvania killed seven people, injured 11 people, displaced three
families, destroyed one building, caused significant structural damage
to several others, and forced the evacuation of many people. According
to a preliminary report by the NTSB, the cause of the explosion was a
leak from a natural gas pipeline distribution system. The point of
failure was likely a service tee made from Dupont Aldyl A plastic. This
pipe material has been known to be susceptible to failure for decades.
In 1988, the NTSB published a special investigative report on
``Brittle-Like Cracking in Plastic Pipe for Gas Service,'' \4\ which
included information pertaining to Aldyl A and other polyethylene pipe.
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)
added Aldyl A service tees to a list of pipe materials with ``poor
performance histories relative to brittle-like cracking'' in a
voluntary advisory bulletin on September 6, 2007. Pipeline industry-
developed standards also call attention to the integrity problems with
this particular type of service tee, though these standards are also
voluntary. A recent PHMSA Notice of Proposed Rulemaking would
specifically add Aldyl A pipe to distribution pipeline operator's
integrity management programs, asking operators to consider the risk of
the presence of this material in their system. At what point do we go
beyond recommending operators remove problematic materials from their
systems and make it explicitly illegal for this material to be part of
our nation's pipelines? Please remember that there are 7 dinner tables
have had an empty seat since that day. And that's just one of the 24
serious pipeline failures that led to fatalities or serious injuries
last year.

The common themes among the pipeline disasters I've shared today
are Congress and the regulators leaving too much up to voluntary or
performance-based efforts from the industry. It's great to offer
flexibility for industry leaders to demonstrate how to accomplish
pipeline safety and make new advancements. However, the regulations
also need to ensure that the industry's laggards are also operating
safe pipelines.
Please, remember the 23 people who have died from pipeline failures
since the last time I testified before this subcommittee 14 months ago.
I can tell you, from working with the families in Bellingham who lost
their sons in 1999, the pain never goes away.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you. I would like to thank you all for
your testimony. We will now turn to the panel for questions. I
will recognize myself for 5 minutes.
Last December, this committee passed the PIPES Act of 2023
on a bipartisan basis, which provides PHMSA with a 4-year
authorization and congressional direction for Federal pipeline
safety policy. Unfortunately, while we continue to work to
advance this legislation, the authorization for PHMSA expired
in September of 2023.
Can you each briefly describe the effects of a lack of
authorization, and what benefits does reauthorization provide?
And I will start with you, Deputy Administrator Brown, and
then we will go down the panel.
Mr. Brown. I will be real brief, just to make sure you get
to everybody. There are no direct effects. But obviously,
having the requisite resources to oversee the additional
product moving that we oversee and the direction that we get
every few years of what is most important to this body, this
subcommittee, and the larger Chamber and body of Congress is
very important to our work.
Mr. Nehls. Ms. Sames?
Ms. Sames. Thank you. In my opinion, not putting forward
reauthorization actually limits PHMSA in some regards. They are
in a holding pattern, waiting to see what occurs with
legislation, and I believe are a little hesitant to move
certain things forward until they get the full direction of
Congress.
There are some great things in reauthorization, at least
that this committee proposed, that I truly believe will improve
pipeline safety, especially in regards to excavation damage
prevention and additional grant funding that will incentivize
States to enact leading practices.
I think, with the change of direction, PHMSA can continue
its great role of moving pipeline safety forward. We are hoping
it comes soon.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you.
Mr. Rorick?
Mr. Rorick. Similarly, we hear from our members regularly
that certainty is absolutely critical so that they can make the
investments that they need and then operate their businesses.
Having regular reauthorizations and making sure that PHMSA
fulfills the obligations from past authorizations provides that
level of certainty so that our companies know where to invest,
what kind of technologies to invest in, what kind of practices
to invest in.
So, providing that certainty and that clarity is critical
to ensuring that we have the reliability and efficiency that
customers expect from us.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you.
Mr. Caram?
Mr. Caram. Well, prompt reauthorization of the agency is,
of course, important. I think what is more important is the
safety advancements that are made in that legislation, more
than the promptness of the reauthorization.
Mr. Nehls. I think it is fantastic. The House did their
will. I mean, we had a bipartisan bill that has been sitting on
Chuck Schumer's desk for months, and he has done nothing with
it, and I don't know when he is going to do anything, if
anything at all. They seem to be very dysfunctional over there.
So, I would probably--I would like to ask--excuse me--where
is my--Ms. Sames, we talked a little bit about the PIPES Act of
2023, and you mentioned it a little bit about the--reduce the
excavation damage incidents. Talk about that. What is the
impact of excavation damage incidents on the gas distribution
systems?
Ms. Sames. It is the leading cause of our incidents. Well,
that and vehicles hitting pipelines, if you look at the
statistics. And unfortunately, excavation damage, it is going
in the wrong direction.
Mr. Nehls. Yes.
Ms. Sames. So, if I look at, like, the 20-year trend for
serious incidents: 20-year trend, we were at 24.6 percent of
all incidents being excavation damage. If I jump to the 3-year
trend, it goes up to 28 percent. If I go to significant
incidents, the 20-year trend is 33.6 percent. If I jump to 3
years, it is now 42.4 percent.
So, for the distribution industry, our focus is really on
how do we reduce these excavation incidents. I believe PHMSA
has done a great job with helping to create the Common Ground
Alliance, and implementing 811 Call Before You Dig, and
providing grants, but it is not enough.
So, we really need some additional incentives for States to
adopt leading practices. And then honestly, we need really good
enforcement at the State level for those that aren't--where it
is cheaper for them to hit the pipeline instead of calling
before digging.
Mr. Nehls. And I agree with you, and I think the PIPES Act
of 2023 addresses some of those issues.
Thank you, I yield back. I now recognize the ranking member
for 5 minutes for questions.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you.
Mr. Caram, do you think that pipeline operators are doing a
good job of supporting the communities where there are
accidents and incidents?
Mr. Caram. No operator wants their pipeline to fail, and
so, nothing is intentional. But I think, when we look at the
long-term trends, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, on
fatalities, on total incidents, on significant incidents, and
the fact that those trend lines are statistically flat, I don't
think that we are making sufficient progress in keeping our
communities safe.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Do you know how they engage with
schools and other members of the public?
Mr. Caram. Yes. There is--I think public engagement has
been an area where the industry, the regulators have all fallen
a bit short. But there has been progress made recently. There
has been a new recommended practice on public engagement that
was put together by a working group under API. And it has just
recently been adopted, and it outlines some great best
practices for operators to share information in how to engage
with the people around the pipeline, with schools, and everyone
affected by the pipelines.
I hope that operators will incorporate that, and that we
will see an improvement in public engagement. But right now, I
think we are seeing a lot of poor public engagement across the
country.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. OK. The National Transportation
Safety Board identified that at the tragic UGI pipeline
explosion in West Reading, Pennsylvania, there was an older
service tee erroneously still in use made from a material,
Aldyl A, that PHMSA identified in 2007 as having a poor
performance history. Is this PHMSA's way of saying that
pipeline operators should get rid of pipelines with that
material?
Mr. Caram. Yes, yes, but it is a voluntary advisory
bulletin, and it was also recently incorporated into a proposed
rule on distribution systems to look at Aldyl A's service tees
in the DIMP program, in the Distribution Integrity Management.
But again, that is performance-based and leaving it up to
operators, so, there has been a lot of encouragement to find
all of the Aldyl A in systems and the service tees and remove
them, but it has not been mandatory.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Do you know what operators said they
would do about using this material, and what have they done
about it?
Mr. Caram. I think operators have been looking for it. This
product was installed in pipelines many decades ago, and
recordkeeping may not have been what it is required to be now.
And so, there is a challenge in finding every instance of this
service tee in a system. But I believe it is the operator's
responsibility to find it and remove it.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you.
Mr. Brown, Mr. Caram outlined the devastating personal
impact to the loss of life from pipeline incidents and
accidents. What is the economic impact to communities where
there are pipeline accidents and incidents?
I am particularly thinking of West Reading, where the
chocolate factory was one of the town's largest employers. That
loss will have a severe long-term economic impact to the
community. What is the economic impact?
Mr. Brown. Well, I know everybody here has seen the tragedy
that can occur like the one that you referenced, and the
impacts can be myriad. Of course, first and foremost, is the
impact on families and loved ones and community members.
I was just in Jackson, Mississippi, with Congressman
Thompson and meeting with the community there that was affected
by a tragic fatality. There is a lot of concern, and people
wonder if their systems are safe. Businesses can lose access to
energy supplies. The impacts are myriad.
So, I applaud the committee's work in trying to identify
those impacts. Certainly, when we see a loss of a system that
people rely on for energy, there are many direct and indirect
impacts.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize my
colleague from the great State of Texas, Mr. Babin, for 5
minutes.
Dr. Babin. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I want to
thank the witnesses for being here.
Deputy Administrator Brown, PHMSA is far behind schedule in
completing the idle pipeline rulemaking which, as you know, is
required by Congress to be promulgated by the end of December
of 2022. PHMSA should not continue to regulate idle and fully
active pipelines the same. Idle pipes do not carry hazardous
materials, as you know, and they are disconnected from sources
that allow for transporting hazardous materials. So, the
regulations should be appropriately tailored to reflect the
reduced risk of incident. Regulating idle pipelines the same as
active pipelines means that PHMSA is directing precious and
limited resources here, when the funds could be much better
used implementing other regulations.
So, you joined us, Administrator Brown, for a hearing on
reauthorization last year. And in your responses to questions
for the record, you indicated that PHMSA intends to issue a
proposed rule in the first quarter of this year. This has come
and gone. I ask you, why has PHMSA still not completed this
rule?
Is there an updated timeline for completion that you might
be able to share with us?
Mr. Brown. Yes.
Dr. Babin. Briefly.
Mr. Brown. At the committee's direction and the Congress'
direction, we update on a monthly basis all of our rulemakings
from the 2020 PIPES Act. I believe that one is slated for later
this year.
I will be perfectly honest with you, though. We have got--
you gave us 36 mandates in the last reauthorization bill. That
is compared to 19 mandates in the previous reauthorization
bill. So, we had almost double the number of directives from
you. And so, we continue to triage the directives with the
highest safety impact to reduce safety risk to the American
people first. And so, that one is on the list of priorities, it
is just lower than the high-risk rulings that we are working
through.
Dr. Babin. Mr. Rorick, would you elaborate on the impact
that the idle pipe rule will have on our industry and is having
on our industry?
Mr. Rorick. Yes, sir, and we have been very vocal as an
association, and you have heard quite a bit from our industry,
I am sure, Representative Babin, about the challenges
associated with permitting for new pipelines, even doing some
work on existing pipelines. Those permitting challenges are not
going away.
This--being able to--right now there are two categories, as
you pointed out, active and abandoned pipe, and that abandoned
pipe has to be pulled out. Getting this classification for idle
pipe would allow companies to leave the pipe in the ground so
that they can come back and use it together.
From a safety perspective, they purge the line, they clean
it, they fill it with inert gas so that it rests there
harmless. And it is monitored, but it doesn't take the same
required resources that you pointed out earlier.
But if we are going to continue to operate this
infrastructure in this country without building more, then we
are going to need all the pipe that we have gotten.
Dr. Babin. Amen. Thank you.
One more question for you, Mr. Brown. In the 2020 PIPES
Act, Congress mandated that PHMSA update its safety regulations
governing large-scale LNG export facilities. The last time you
appeared before us here at the committee, you mentioned that it
was a high priority, and yet the proposed rule has still not
been released yet. Again, timeliness seems to be a problem with
you and PHMSA.
Why has PHMSA still not completed this rule, and what is
the status of this regulation?
Mr. Brown. Well, I would echo my earlier answer, but I will
just add that in your home State, we had one of the largest
exporters of LNG experience a 400-foot-high fireball, an
explosion at that facility. Luckily, no one was killed. We want
to learn what went wrong there and include it in the updates.
And that is part of the reason we are continuing our
investigation of that incident. But we want to include the
lessons learned from that incident in that rulemaking.
Dr. Babin. OK, last question. As you know, PHMSA may
reimburse States for up to 80 percent of costs incurred by
States in enforcing pipeline safety laws and regulation. Given
that Texas is far and away the leading State in terms of total
pipeline miles, we are spending more than any other State to
meet these safety standards.
Unfortunately, Texas is receiving significantly less than
the authorized 80-percent reimbursement. I just want to put
this on your radar as an issue if you are not already aware of
that. I would also like to encourage your team to work with
both the Railroad Commission of Texas and Texans on this
subcommittee, myself and Chairman Nehls, to ensure that we can
get this fixed with a long-term solution that doesn't leave the
Nation's number-one energy producer in an unsustainable
financial situation.
And so, if you can get in touch with our team, send us the
requested information about the things that I have asked, I
certainly would appreciate it.
Mr. Brown. Yes, sir.
And Mr. Chairman, if I can just respond with a thank you to
Congress, just a few weeks ago, the fiscal year 2024
appropriations bill included a big boost for the State program
grants. So, we anticipate getting a boost in funding to the
State of Texas, along with the rest of your States. So, thank
you for that.
Dr. Babin. Thank you, and I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize a valued
member of this subcommittee, Mr. Moulton, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Moulton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Back in May of 2018, the Merrimack Valley, homes just
started exploding across several towns. The gas pipeline was
overpressurized, dramatically overpressurized, and literally,
explosions started coming out of people's houses. An 18-year-
old, Leonel Rondon, was killed. And I worked with my
Massachusetts colleagues to update pipeline regulations.
My colleague from Texas has just made the same point, but
why is it taking so long to just get these rules finalized? I
mean, any day another accident could happen. You just talked
about a 400-foot fireball in Texas. Why the delay?
Mr. Brown. We follow the Administrative Procedure Act, and
then we also follow the statutes that govern us, which includes
an additional advisory committee review which includes five
public interest representatives, five industry representatives,
five State government representatives. That takes an extra many
months to work through the highly technical issues involved in
these regulations.
The other thing is that we regulate thousands of operators,
each with unique systems. So, creating a one-size-fits-all rule
is very difficult. It usually means we end up in the courts
because one entity doesn't like what we do, or a small group of
entities doesn't like how we are directing operators to
operate.
So, those are just a few of the big challenges we have. But
the obvious one is resources that--we had--we started off with
two regulatory attorneys working on rules like the one that you
directed us to do, Congressman. We have doubled that as soon as
the administration took office, and we have set a record number
of rules in the first year that we got here. But there is still
a backlog. And so, we appreciate this committee's support for
additional resources for additional rulemaking team members.
Mr. Moulton. OK. The last PHMSA reauthorization included a
provision requiring the Secretary of Transportation to submit a
report to Congress about the need for an independent pipeline
testing facility under DOT. My understanding is that PHMSA is
the only--essentially, pipelines are the only major mode of
transportation that does not have a dedicated research,
testing, and evaluation facility.
Has PHMSA finalized the report, and do you know when it
will be delivered to Congress?
Mr. Brown. We are part of the way through in that report.
It has not been finalized. We do fund nonprofits that do some
of that pipeline research testing through the funds you
authorize, as well.
Mr. Moulton. Can you give us any idea of what the timeline
is? Because partway through does not sound encouraging.
Mr. Brown. Yes, I would suggest a matter of months. We have
had discussions with folks on both sides of the aisle in
multiple committees on that, and I think there is varying
interest in the subject of creating a facility.
But we look forward to getting you that report.
Mr. Moulton. Can you give us some indication of what the
findings or recommendations will be?
Mr. Brown. I have not seen a draft yet.
Mr. Moulton. That is not encouraging.
Mr. Brown. But I will be glad to provide you an update as
soon as we can.
Mr. Moulton. OK. Shifting topics for a second, integrity
management programs are the primary tool that pipeline
operators use to ensure the safety of their pipelines. Does
this work? Is it a good system?
Mr. Brown. We have got thousands of operators, and it is
certainly working well with some, and I think certainly not
with others. And so, coupled with our push, this committee's
push, the stakeholders here's push for pipeline safety
management systems where you are constantly looking and
challenging your own presumptions in where risks may be, I
think there is a lot of promise.
I think we heard some--we welcome the constructive
criticism of where it might not be working. That is really
fundamental to a safety management system, is that you are
always looking for, well, what are we missing here? And with
integrity management, because systems are so different, it is
hard to write a single rule, prescriptive rule for the
disparate systems across the country.
Mr. Moulton. Do you feel that it is the right approach, or
should we be taking an entirely different approach?
Mr. Brown. I would say all--that is just one approach that
we have, but we are investing in research. We issue safety
advisories, we issue directives when--emergency orders when
needed. So, I think there is promise. It is what--I think the
rest of the world does use a lot of this--a similar
nonprescriptive regulatory scheme, but we want to use just any
tool in our toolbelt to address safety risks.
Mr. Moulton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr. Rouzer
for 5 minutes.
Mr. Rouzer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Brown, with regard to the leak detection and repair
rule, when will the agency release the final rule, do you
anticipate?
Mr. Brown. Our monthly update suggests, I think, by the end
of the year.
Mr. Rouzer. Will the White House and CEQ be involved in
reviewing this rule, the rulemaking?
Mr. Brown. Through the interagency process, every agency
will have an opportunity to provide feedback in doing that. In
the proposal stage, I think there was minimal involvement.
Really, the input comes at the advisory committee stage, where
we have got input from a lot of the stakeholders here to try to
build consensus around that rule, which we have largely been
able to do.
Mr. Rouzer. Is the agency working with the EPA to harmonize
this rule with new EPA methane regulations, since there will be
overlapping requirements?
Mr. Brown. Yes, we did that at the proposed rule stage. As
you know, sometimes the rules don't align perfectly from a time
standpoint, where you have a proposed rule that you might be
working on but you are waiting on another agency to propose
their rule. So, we are harmonizing, though, to try to minimize
overlap between our agencies.
Mr. Rouzer. Yes. Is it the position of the agency that all
leaks are hazardous?
Mr. Brown. I was just in Jackson, Mississippi, where a
nonhazardous leak resulted in the death of Clara Barbour. So,
we are highly concerned about the potential for a nonhazardous
leak to become hazardous. But not all nonhazardous leaks are
hazardous.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Rorick, in your written testimony you
highlight concerns that API and the industry have with the
PHMSA's leak detection and repair notice of proposed
rulemaking. Specifically, I noted that your testimony explained
that PHMSA exceeded the scope of the language in section 113 of
the 2020 PIPES Act. Can you elaborate on that?
Mr. Rorick. So, we believe that PHMSA, in the proposed
rule, went beyond what Congress mandated them to do,
specifically going into rural gathering lines in LNG
facilities, in those two particular areas.
And then consequently, by doing that, particularly for the
rural gathering lines, you are pulling in areas that would then
dilute--someone mentioned the concern earlier about PHMSA
diluting their limited resources. That would certainly do it.
And there is a potential of missing more significant releases
in more densely populated areas.
Mr. Caram. May I address that question?
Mr. Rouzer. Sure, absolutely.
Mr. Caram. Briefly? Thank you very much. I just want to add
that at the advisory committee meeting just last month, there
was a unanimous vote on the inclusion of those rural gathering
lines that included the industry vote, and with a lot of nuance
around how that would impact those lines.
Mr. Rouzer. I note that PHMSA is required to conduct a
cost-benefit analysis for all its rulemakings. Any comment on
how you think that will play out?
Mr. Rorick. Yes, sir. If you look at both--and I think that
we would probably disagree with the Deputy Administrator a
little bit on the overlap with EPA. Where EPA looks at flow
rate, this proposed rule would look at concentration threshold.
So, there is some conflict there with the EPA rule.
But if you add in the low threshold, it would effectively
remove a lot of the opportunities that current operators use to
maintain and look for these leaks. So, they would effectively
have to walk their lines with handheld meters. And then, if you
pull in those rural gathering lines, that is an extra cost and
burden there. And I don't know that their cost-benefit analysis
looked at the safety and environmental benefits associated with
items such as those.
Mr. Rouzer. With that, I will yield back. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr. Garcia
for 5 minutes.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking
Member, for holding this very important and timely hearing.
I, too, want to take a moment to recognize the passing of
the former ranking member of this subcommittee, Congressman
Payne. I hold the utmost respect for him and his leadership
displayed time and time over the years. He will be missed.
Moving to the topic of today's hearing, we have heard from
my colleagues about the importance of pipeline safety. Indeed,
safety should be the number-one priority when transporting
materials like CO2 and odorless asphyxiant that can be deadly
if improperly managed. And that is exactly what we should be
concerned about as we look to the future, especially as
industry looks to dramatically expand our network of carbon
dioxide pipelines.
Mr. Rorick, American Petroleum Institute's testimony boasts
about the safety of pipelines. Your testimony states that the
industry `` . . . has been operating CO2 pipelines safely for
more than four decades, with no fatalities . . .'' But a CO2
pipeline rupture in Satartia, Mississippi, caused 45 people to
be hospitalized from CO2 poisoning, where people lay on the
ground shaking and unable to breathe. It was lucky that this
tragedy didn't end worse.
Mr. Rorick, yes or no, does that sound safe to you?
Mr. Rorick. There are certainly risks associated with that,
it was a tragic incident. No, that is an incident that we would
like to have avoided, sir. I would like to go into more
details, but you asked for a yes or no.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you. Let me give you another
example. Just a month ago in Sulphur, Louisiana, an estimated
107,000 gallons of CO2 leaked from a pipeline owned by
ExxonMobil. Local police and firefighters could do nothing than
set up roadblocks and wait for the pipeline's owner to repair
it. It took more than 2 hours to repair, and many residents
were never notified of the leak. Yes or no, does that sound
safe?
Mr. Rorick. The incident occurred, but that doesn't
necessarily mean the pipeline wasn't safe, sir.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. My final question, Mr. Rorick, how
much do CO2 pipeline developers stand to profit from these
pipelines?
Mr. Rorick. I am not in a position to answer that, sir. You
would have to ask those individual operators.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Well, since you are not sure, I
will tell you that in the Midwest, Summit Carbon Solutions, the
largest proposed network of CO2 pipes in the Nation, could be
eligible for up to $18 billion in tax benefits for their
project. That is just one company.
It is apparent that there are dangerous gaps in Federal
regulations that keep people safe, and huge economic
motivations for the companies that want to see these pipelines
built. Leak notification systems, detection methods for
odorless CO2, and emergency response plans are nowhere near
built out. We should be putting a moratorium on all CO2
pipelines until we can ensure that people, especially ones in
vulnerable communities where these are built, will be
protected.
Thank you, and I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr.
Stauber for 5 minutes.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Brown, the class location rule allows pipeline
companies to employ modern inspection technologies to prove the
safety of existing pipelines when population changes occur
nearby instead of outdated, expensive, and environmentally
unhelpful methods.
We have talked about the Gas Pipeline Advisory Committee
that convened a meeting on the class location rule and voted
overwhelmingly to meet again on the rulemaking within 12
months. Can PHMSA commit to holding the next GPAC meeting on
the class location rule before March of 2025?
Mr. Brown. We were able to hold that meeting, Congressman,
a few weeks ago, and we completed the work on that rule.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you. So, Mr. Brown, how many barrels of
oil--I am from Minnesota--how many barrels of oil do we produce
annually in Minnesota?
Mr. Brown. I am not familiar with the State level of that.
Mr. Stauber. Zero. That was--I just wanted to share with
you something that concerns me.
How many total miles of pipelines in the United States,
totally?
Mr. Brown. Roughly a little over 3 million.
Mr. Stauber. How many miles of those pipelines are
involving oil and gas?
Mr. Brown. Involve oil or gas? Roughly 3 million.
Mr. Stauber. Total?
Mr. Brown. Total.
Mr. Stauber. So, if the Biden administration gets their way
of removing the oil and gas industry, would that be down to
zero pipelines, then?
Mr. Brown. I am not sure I follow. Could you repeat the
question?
Mr. Stauber. If the Biden administration gets their way of
removing oil and gas industry from the United States, would we
be down to zero pipelines?
Mr. Brown. I am not familiar with any proposal to do such a
thing. And in fact, the number of pipelines has increased, I
believe, 17 percent in the transmission space over just the
last few years, 13 percent overall in just the last few years.
So--and then, with record investments in new, emerging
technologies--hydrogen, CO2--there is potentially a continued
expansion there.
Mr. Stauber. Right. You have a very impressive background.
So, would you say the technology in the pipeline safety and the
enhancements thereof have done very well in the last 10 years?
Mr. Brown. Absolutely. The technologies are incredible.
Mr. Stauber. Ms. Sames, congratulations on your retirement.
Ms. Sames. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Stauber. This may be one of your last meetings with
testifying but, again, thanks for your service and thanks for
your knowledge.
Would you agree that the--because, really, the safety for
the pipelines is a bipartisan issue, and we want that--would
you agree that the technology involving the safety within the
pipelines has greatly been enhanced in the last 10 years?
Ms. Sames. It has greatly enhanced over the decades I have
been in service.
Mr. Stauber. Mr. Rorick?
Mr. Rorick. Yes, sir, by leaps and bounds.
Mr. Stauber. Mr. Caram?
Mr. Caram. Yes, there has been a lot of great technological
advancement on pipeline safety.
Mr. Stauber. So, one of my concerns I have is we always
talk about pipeline safety on both sides of the aisle. And we
have what I would say are unlawful people, valve turners trying
to damage pipelines and what have you. Does everybody on the
panel agree that those terrorists that damage pipelines and
cause union members to be in danger and the public to be in
danger, do you all agree that they should be prosecuted to the
full extent of the law because of the danger they are putting
us all in?
Mr. Brown, and we will just go right down the line.
Mr. Brown. Should--terrorists who threaten or damage
pipelines should be prosecuted.
Mr. Stauber. To the full extent of the law?
Mr. Brown. To the full extent of the law.
Mr. Stauber. Ms. Sames?
Ms. Sames. I absolutely agree.
Mr. Stauber. Mr. Rorick?
Mr. Rorick. Oh, we would absolutely agree, sir.
Mr. Stauber. Mr. Caram?
Mr. Caram. Yes, we don't support any creation of an unsafe
condition like that on a pipeline.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you very much. And I just want to thank
you all for coming and sharing your testimony. Being on the
full committee of T&I, this really--a lot of these issues are
bipartisan. And I think that we need to recognize the safety
issue. It affects us all. And I am really thankful that the
chairman brought this meeting together today to talk about the
safety issue, which is the number-one issue that we are
discussing today.
And Mr. Chair, I thank you for your leadership and I yield
back.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you, sir. And just for note, our bill that
we passed here does strengthen the penalties for those that
want to create that terrorist act on our pipelines.
So, the gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr. Huffman, Mr.
Huffman for 5 minutes.
Mr. Huffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank
the witnesses.
Thank you in particular to Mr. Caram for speaking some
important truths about the inherent dangers and risks of this
spider web of combustible infrastructure that we rely on to
power the fossil fuel economy.
I think there is too much fossil fuel business as usual in
this country, certainly in this conversation about continuing
to build out this system that is, frankly, a disaster waiting
to happen every day, and it does happen just about every day. I
heard about a fireball in an LNG facility just now that I had
never heard about before. It pretty much doesn't even make news
because it is just the cost of fossil fuel business as usual
that we have come to accept. I feel like, by passing a bill
that doesn't do nearly enough to acknowledge this, much less do
anything about it, we are sleepwalking further into the climate
crisis and further and further into tragedies and disasters.
Now, you don't have to look far to find examples of this.
Over the last 12 years, the Keystone pipeline has had 22
oilspills, including 2 large spills between 2017 and 2019. Then
again in 2022, it spilled an estimated 14,000 barrels in
Nebraska. And because of these issues, the GAO issued a report
in July of 2021 regarding Keystone pipeline's safety record,
which included a shocking revelation. The Keystone, with this
terrible record, was not an outlier. It has about the same
safety level, on average, as pipelines all over the country.
This, taken with Mr. Caram's testimony showing that 2023
was the deadliest year for pipeline safety in America in 20
years, should be a red flag. It is a clear sign of how
concerned we should be by the state of our pipeline
infrastructure, and especially by this increased build-out that
we are sleepwalking toward in this committee and in this
Congress.
Now, sadly, another example of the significant threat
pipelines pose can be seen with the failure of the Denbury gulf
coast pipeline in 2020. This exposed the community of Satartia,
Mississippi, to dangerous levels of CO2. When it ruptured, it
took just a few minutes for residents to feel the effects.
Fifty of them went to the hospital. A significant number are
still suffering effects today.
Now, these accidents and failures are not outliers. We are
continuing to see the same problems from the same entities
everywhere we look. Just last month, there was another CO2
pipeline leak from a pipeline owned by Denbury, this time in
Sulphur, Louisiana.
So, Mr. Brown, after Satartia and that CO2 pipeline
disaster, PHMSA found that Denbury made a lot of mistakes. They
significantly underestimated the size of the affected area, did
inadequate monitoring, took too long to notify officials. One
would hope that Denbury would have been closely monitored and
scrutinized by PHMSA to make sure that these findings were
corrected for. But sadly, it appears that many of the same
failures occurred with the Sulphur, Louisiana, leak.
Apparently, Denbury was unaware of the failure, took hours to
arrive on scene. And if this leak had occurred when residents
were in the area during the day, it could have been
catastrophic.
So, are there any failures or lessons learned that PHMSA
identified and informed Denbury about--now they are owned by
ExxonMobil, of course--to correct after Satartia?
And in reviewing the aftermath now of the second incident
in Sulphur, Louisiana, which of these seem to have gone ignored
or unaddressed?
Mr. Brown. I can note that there are numerous directives
that we provided to Denbury after the first incident. We are
still in the investigative phase of the second incident, which
can take some time.
We also applied those lessons learned, which I know you had
asked me the last time I was here about, to a proposed rule
that we hope to have out in the next few weeks to create the
strongest standards for CO2 pipeline----
Mr. Huffman [interrupting]. Right, I think we all look
forward to seeing that rule.
Look, we have only about 5,000 miles of CO2 pipelines right
now, most of it in rural areas. Thankfully, when something
terrible happens, as it will continue to do, we have not yet
seen major population centers affected. However, there is
tremendous pressure now to build out this network. I think it
is inevitable that incidents like Satartia and like Sulphur,
Louisiana, are coming to more populated areas in the near
future. And this committee, unfortunately, is sleepwalking into
that fate.
With all of this pipeline boosterism not only worsening the
climate crisis but taking us further to these tragedies, we
haven't even talked about the blending of hydrogen into natural
gas pipelines. I don't have time to go into it, but there is
far more that needs to be talked about, that needs to be
addressed, and we need to be worried about in this committee if
we are going to be serious about pipeline safety.
With that, I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr.
Johnson from South Dakota.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Brown, as you know, the PIPES Act of 2020 implemented a
new technology pilot program. This was to allow people to try
some new technological innovations, obviously, to increase
safety. I can imagine all kinds of situations where inline
inspection or leak detection innovations, we would want those
brought to market or to the field, rather, in some sort of a
pilot program.
When you were here last, I thought we had a good,
productive conversation. I just want to pick up where we left
off there. It is my understanding that we still don't have
anybody utilizing that pilot program. So, have you all had any
applications?
Mr. Brown. Yes, well, thank you for your constructive
question last time and directive, really, and offer to work
together. We had some constructive discussions after that with
stakeholders.
The goal is to get new technologies deployed that produce
environmental benefits. We have laws that still apply to us--
unless you tell us they don't apply--to consider environmental
benefits. As far as I have heard, there is no interest in
avoiding consideration of environmental benefits, right?
Everybody wants that because new technologies tend to produce
environmental benefits. So, the--really, it is just making sure
the laws align and how to do it efficiently to consider those
environmental----
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota [interrupting]. So, do we have
any applicants to use the pilot program?
Mr. Brown. Well, the program hasn't changed. We sought
feedback from the public. We didn't get feedback from the
public, but we did get feedback in this committee that said,
you know what, from stakeholders we don't find this sufficient
because we have to consider the National Environmental Policy
Act analysis in the utilization of that program.
And so, really, we are just discussing, well, is there
another way to consider those environmental impacts so that we
can more quickly adopt technologies? We are glad to work with
you to address that.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. So, you are saying that the
pilot program, as currently outlined in law, does not provide
any meaningful benefits to operators.
Mr. Brown. Nobody has used it yet, correct.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. So, what do we need to--I
mean, we know that there are these innovations. Presumably, we
would want to test them in the field in a pilot program so we
could get good data about their efficacy. How do we get that
done, if not through this pilot program?
Mr. Brown. Well, I think I would leave it up to some of my
colleagues here to answer, but our goal is the same goal that
you have. We don't want to just use the American people as
guinea pigs here, right? We want to make sure there is an
equivalent level of safety, and that there are not new
environmental costs to the public, right?
So, I think everybody is on the same page of what we are
trying to get at, and the question is just how to do it. We----
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota [interrupting]. So, how--I
mean, and again, that is why it is great we have got this panel
of experts.
And Mr. Rorick, I will go to you next to kind of get a
sense from you, number one, if innovations do exist, and number
two, how best for us to deploy them in a manner as Deputy
Administrator Brown said.
But Mr. Brown, so, how do we get that done? You said that
is the question. That is the question I am asking.
Mr. Brown. Well, how you currently do it is you demonstrate
an equivalent level of safety to us, and then we could issue a
special permit that would allow you to deviate from existing
standards or regulations. So, there is actually a current way
to do it, and then Congress devised a third way, which is this
pilot program.
But using that pilot program, you still have to analyze the
potential environmental impacts.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Sure.
Mr. Brown. Right? And the question was, well, do you have
to analyze those environmental impacts? And I think we heard--
and maybe Mr. Rorick's testimony says, no, you don't have to
examine the environmental impacts.
Well, actually, I think most of your members say, well, we
want positive environmental impacts----
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota [interrupting]. So, you talked
about people making these filings to be able to get clearance
to put into place a new practice. How common are those filings
with PHMSA?
Mr. Brown. They vary widely. So----
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota [interrupting]. I mean, would
they be monthly, quarterly, annually?
Mr. Brown. For specific technologies? They are not
frequent.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. OK. Mr. Rorick?
Mr. Rorick. So, I think that, right now, the way the
program is designed is just too onerous and too cumbersome for
companies to participate. So, if we are going to be able to
bring these technologies into the testing phase, as you
identify, Representative Johnson, I think we are going to have
to--Congress is going to have to provide a pathway for PHMSA to
deviate away from their special permit process so that we don't
get bogged down in NEPA and some of these other procedural
processes that PHMSA currently has with the program.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. I would just say this--and
thanks for the colloquy, sir.
But Deputy Administrator, I mean, for 4 years, Congress has
been saying that they want to make it--that they want these new
technologies brought to bear so that we can get a safer and
better system. The fact that for 4 years PHMSA has not figured
out a way to work with partners to get that done obviously
means we have got some work to do. And I guess I would ask for
urgency within the agency and within the Hill for us to get
that done.
And with that, I would yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. Mr. Kean, you are
recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank
you to all of our witnesses for being here today.
And before I begin, I just want to add my voice to those
who mourn the loss of Congressman Payne. He was a tremendous
leader on this subcommittee and also for all things New Jersey.
So, my prayers are with him and with his family.
My first question is to Ms. Sames. Pipeline safety
technology is continually adapting and improving. However,
sometimes it takes a while for Federal agencies to catch up and
allow new operations or technology to be used. What challenges
have you seen with getting new technology approved?
Ms. Sames. Well, I think we just discussed some of them.
With the current program at PHMSA, it is unbelievably
burdensome for new operators to apply for the use of new
technology.
The other issue that I see, though, is when a new
technology comes to the market and is proven, but isn't allowed
due to the current regulations. Let me explain, and I will give
an example.
So, right now, PHMSA's regulations require an operator to
put a bollard or, basically, a device in front of a meter to
protect that meter. And that was appropriate back in the 1970s,
when the regulations were created. However--and the reason you
put that in place is so that, if the meter is hit, it doesn't
release gas. You don't want gas to be released.
But we now have breakaway technologies that--and excess
flow valves that, if that meter is hit, it immediately shuts
off the flow of gas. But an operator can't use that technology
because PHMSA's current regulation requires an obstacle be put
in place to protect the meter. I would love to see PHMSA look
at how can current technologies really be used to meet the
intent of a regulation in a different way. Use these new
technologies. They are already proven.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you.
Deputy Administrator Brown, the PIPES Act of 2020 required
PHMSA to issue safety regulations for pipelines considered in
an idled pipeline status by December 2022. Now, the PIPES Act
of 2023 follows up on this mandate and requires its completion
within 180 days. What is the status of this regulation, and
when does PHMSA anticipate completing this ruling?
Mr. Brown. Congressman, we provide monthly updates on the
status. I believe that one is slated for the end of the year.
But as I stated earlier, we have more rules than we have
people working on them. We had twice the number of directives
in the PIPES Act of 2020 than we had in 2016. So, the
additional resources in the bipartisan legislation you are
considering will be very helpful in helping us get that rule
completed.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Do you believe that an updated
idled pipeline rule will increase pipeline safety?
Mr. Brown. I think we had some good commentary that
addressed that. I have not looked at--we haven't--I can't
really comment on a rule we haven't written yet. We would have
to lay out that justification.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Mr. Rorick, the PIPES Act of 2023
includes authorization of a voluntary information-sharing
system at PHMSA. From your perspective, how much participation
would a VIS system see from pipeline operators?
Mr. Rorick. If designed appropriately, Congressman, which
means proper information protections, providing a system where
companies can submit information and there is no reach-back
authority in a punitive fashion, I believe companies would
actively participate in it. I think this committee was wise to
design a program that was modeled after other successful
programs like the program that exists for pilots and with the
FAA. So, I think you would get good participation, sir, if
designed appropriately.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. And what pipeline safety outcomes
do you envision once a VIS system is established and
operational?
Mr. Rorick. Yes, sir. We do a lot of work right now looking
at data, whether it is prevention data or what have you,
investing in technologies. This would provide some data of both
incidents and near-misses that may occur so that we can, as an
industry and working with the regulator, monitor trends, but
then also look at individual reporting data to see what sort of
learnings we can gain from those, as well.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr.
Menendez for 5 minutes.
Mr. Menendez. Thank you, Chairman. I want to join my
colleagues in recognizing the loss of our colleague, Donald
Payne, Jr. He was an incredible warrior for the city of Newark,
the county of Essex, the State of New Jersey, and for so many
across this country. To me, he was not just a colleague, not
just a friend, he was a mentor and a big brother on both T&I,
on Homeland Security, and in this institution. And I will miss
him dearly. And I trust that our colleague, Representative
Wilson, will do an incredible job picking up the torch and
carrying it forward, as we will all strive to do on the work
that my friend had done for so long. So, I just appreciate that
opportunity.
Today marks 3 years since the ransomware attack on Colonial
Pipeline. This attack led to a temporary disruption in the
delivery of gasoline and other petroleum products across a
large swath of the country. As cyber attacks continue to become
more sophisticated, the need for a strong, coordinated effort
to reinforce our Government and key asset cybersecurity remains
a top priority. We have a particular interest in this topic, as
we also say on the cybersecurity subcommittee of the Homeland
Security Committee.
Mr. Caram, can you discuss how cyber attacks impact our
pipeline network, the safety of our pipelines, and the security
of our country overall?
Mr. Caram. Yes, thanks for the question. I will say that
cybersecurity, I think, poses more of a risk to reliability
than safety, but there are safety issues at play any time a
system is taken over by someone outside the operator who can
close valves, which leads to pressure waves and things like
that. It could create unsafe conditions.
Mr. Menendez. And would you want to elaborate on the
reliability component that you mentioned?
Mr. Caram. Well, reliability is outside the scope of the
Pipeline Safety Trust. I think the operators could probably
speak to reliability better than I could.
Mr. Menendez. Fair enough. And just expanding on that, how
can Congress ensure the security of our Nation's pipeline
network, specifically with respect to cybersecurity?
Mr. Caram. Sure. I mean, there are a lot of best practices
out there, and agencies doing that kind of work.
Again, it is beyond the scope of the Pipeline Safety Trust
to work a lot on cybersecurity, but it does, as I mentioned,
pose safety risks, and so, we are concerned. But yes, I believe
there are agencies out there outlining best practices, and we
would hope that they are regulated in that way.
Mr. Menendez. Sure, thank you.
Mr. Brown, last time you testified before this committee,
we discussed PHMSA's coordination with other agencies, such as
TSA, to address cyber threats. You mentioned that PHMSA was
seeking to hire cyber experts, despite the lack of jurisdiction
over cybersecurity. How has that process been going in terms of
onboarding, hiring cybersecurity experts?
Mr. Brown. Yes, we do train the TSA. We actually engage at
a senior leaders level. In fact, we have an upcoming meeting
with the TSA Administrator and leadership from CISA, as well as
the pipeline sector leadership.
We don't have specific authorization--so, that may be
something worth considering for the committee--to hire in that
space, but that is something that we would like to continue to
make sure we are on top of. Even though we don't have direct
jurisdiction in cybersecurity, it obviously--the nexus, really,
is that a cyber incident can affect operations, or it has the
potential to.
And so, as you mentioned the Colonial incident, that was
what we were most worried about, both on the startup or restart
of the pipeline, as well as in the current--when a pipeline is
already operating. In that case, they voluntarily shut down.
So, we provide that training to the TSA and provide input
on their directives, and we just want to continue to work as
closely as possible. I am glad to work with you, if that is
something of interest to the committee as you consider
reauthorization.
Mr. Menendez. Great, thank you. And is PHMSA pursuing any
additional steps to ensure our pipeline network is prepared for
future attacks?
Mr. Brown. We engage on a voluntary basis with the
regulated entities to discuss--we do regulate control room
management, which are highly IT-focused operations. And so, we
have robust engagement post-Colonial Pipeline incident.
Mr. Menendez. I appreciate that.
Thank you, and I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr.
Burchett for 5 minutes.
Mr. Burchett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I, too, miss our
friend who has passed away. I always enjoyed being down and
doing my 1 minute, and he was always there, dressed very
dapper, and I told him multiple times if I had his wardrobe, I
would have burned mine. So, he will be missed.
Mr. Brown, would you agree that pipelines are the safest
mode of transportation for natural gas and petroleum products?
Mr. Brown. When you factor in the volume of product moved,
I would say so. Obviously, the discussion here today involved a
lot of tragic incidents. And so, for those individuals, it
certainly is not. But when you just talk about it in the
context of volume.
Mr. Burchett. Overall, yes, sir. I mean, there is an
immense number that is moved. Would you agree that these
pipelines provide a lot of jobs and opportunities for some very
hard-working Americans?
Mr. Brown. There are a lot of jobs associated with the
pipeline sector.
Mr. Burchett. And it is hard work. It is not an easy kind
of thing. Would you agree with that, as well?
Mr. Brown. Could you repeat that?
Mr. Burchett. I said--yes, they shut the door on me. They
do that a lot of times on me.
Would agree that this is very hard work?
Mr. Brown. It is very hard work, yes. I have been out
there, and we have got the best workers in the world.
Mr. Burchett. Yes, we do, and thank you for saying that.
According to the Liquid Energy Pipeline Association,
pipelines are the most environmentally protective way to
deliver energy. Earlier this year, the Biden administration
halted new export permits for liquefied natural gas because of
climate change. Did you or anyone at the Department of
Transportation tell President Biden this was an unwise
decision?
Mr. Brown. I did not have any involvement in the pause that
the Department of Energy recently announced.
Mr. Burchett. Would you say that is not you all's
responsibility at TDOT?
Mr. Brown. We do not have any jurisdiction in that space,
no.
Mr. Burchett. OK, I said TDOT, I am used to saying that,
Tennessee Department--I always----
Mr. Brown [interposing]. Yes.
Mr. Burchett. That is where I usually direct most of my
anger.
According to DOT's website, you serve on President Biden's
Carbon Dioxide Capture Task Force. Moving forward, when the
Federal Government makes decisions regarding liquefied natural
gas, I hope that we put American people first and not these
ridiculous climate initiatives.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I will yield back 2 minutes and 34
seconds. Please use it wisely.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr.
DeSaulnier for 5 minutes.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for
this hearing. I will start with Mr. Brown and transition to
anyone else who would like to address this. It is sort of a
good segue for my colleague.
In the context of the times changing, I represent an area
in the San Francisco Bay area that is the densest in terms of
hazardous materials, because of refineries and chemical plants
in the proximity of one of the few deepwater ports on the west
coast. So, it is changing, and a lot of it is because of our
policy in California that I firmly support and have been
leading for many years. But we don't focus as much
collectively, I don't think, on your issues around the
transportation, around the refineries and the chemical plants.
And my question, Mr. Brown, is of those--it used to be six
refineries, there are now five, one of them shut--two of them
have been shut down for an extended period of time to
transition to biofuels, as the California Renewables Portfolio
Standard continues to be implemented, and the market changes
for their product. So, how do we work with the private sector
and anticipate? And to your point about resources and
transparency, how do we make these numbers as transparent as
possible, and the oversight and inspections as transparent as
possible so that we actually are more efficient as we look at
the marketplace change?
Not a comment on--well, our energy resources in California
are changing dramatically. We are leading the country. We are
proud of that. It is more efficient, if you ask me, even
separate from the issues of the damage to the planet. So, how
does your agency--and I will leave these--we have a diverse
panel to talk about that, about being fairly agnostic as to
what my colleague was just talking about, but also being driven
by evidence-based research on how we transition--allow the
local community transition as they see fit, consistent with
State statute?
And again, if you look at a map of the area I represent,
there are just red lines of hazardous materials pipelines all
over. And then, compared to rail and truck transport for these
facilities--and a lot of them think they are going to be
producing hydrogen for many decades to come, so, they are going
to still need that infrastructure. But the transition, it seems
to me, if we get it right, would be really efficient and
transparent, and everyone could follow it. But if we don't,
there is going to continue to be risk to the public and to the
national economy.
And again, lastly, as a Pacific Rim part of the dynamic,
our competitors to the--in China, as they change more
dramatically than we do when they have certain advantages in
their access to raw materials, how do we look at the
comparisons and the global changing thing in terms of
transport? We get a lot of our fuel that is refined in the bay
area still from the North Slope, which is very heavy crude and
requires transport that is specific to that product, both going
into the plant and coming out of it.
Mr. Brown. Well, I couldn't agree more that transparency is
really critical at this stage, and we are in an age of data
where there is just so much data that didn't exist years ago,
and so, voluntarily sharing that information, that is something
our agency tries to do. We report on our website all of our
incident data, enforcement data, which is somewhat unique for
Government agencies.
But also, we recently mapped incidents across the country,
and we are continuing to do that to provide direct data on the
types of incidents that are occurring so that academics or the
public can engage in--I know the Pipeline Safety Trust has
been--that has been a big focus of theirs.
As part of the reauthorization legislation and voluntary
information-sharing system, we have voluntarily tried to create
a space for, when an incident occurs, a sharing of that
information so that other operators can learn from that. I know
Ms. Sames' organization provides an audit of companies
voluntarily.
But basically, opening the books, and sharing information,
and acknowledging where risks exist helps us all try to tackle
those risks collectively.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Mr. Rorick, could you respond, having
worked with the Western States Petroleum Association?
And they described it once as a love-hate relationship.
That may have changed more to the latter. Your industry is
changing a lot.
Mr. Rorick. It is, and we very much view ourselves as both
part of the solution for technological advances for current
activities that we are doing on oil and natural gas, but then
also in the transition. We are going to be part of that, as
well.
I could agree with the Deputy Administrator that regular
engagement, transparency, wherever we can--it doesn't mean we
agree all the time, but certainly the collaboration and the
coordination wherever we can is absolutely critical.
I think you appropriately identified the interaction, the
dependency, if you will, that you have on the North Slope
crude. So, it has to be more than just pipelines. We have to
make sure that we recognize that the infrastructure system is
intertwined and complicated. So, coordination across Federal
agencies and even between the States is critical, as well.
Mr. DeSaulnier. And transparency.
Mr. Rorick. Yes, sir.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Nehls. You bet. The gentleman yields. I now recognize
Mr. Molinaro for 5 minutes.
Mr. Molinaro. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am glad Mr. Brown
referenced the need to share data as it relates to safety
concerns.
One provision that we were able to include in the PHMSA
reauthorization from this body--and I am very grateful--in a
bipartisan way again, this committee produced an outcome--the
House, of course, produced an outcome, and we are still waiting
on the Senate to take action, which, for many of us, is not
only concerning, it is just a consistent waste of time and
resources when there are major advancements that need to
happen.
But one provision we did include that I helped draft in the
reauthorization bill passed in December with my colleague, Mr.
Cohen, was the creation of a voluntary information-sharing
system. This would allow and encourage the sharing of pipeline
safety data and information. We did that with the industry. And
Mr. Brown referenced the value of this kind of sharing of data.
I was not going to start with this question, but it seems
to me, if any of the other witnesses could speak to the value
of that, it would, I think, highlight the need to move the bill
forward.
Mr. Rorick. So, we--the voluntary information-sharing
system, as we discussed a little bit earlier, it could be
incredibly valuable if it is designed appropriately. And what I
mean by that is, so long as the information that is submitted
to the Federal agencies is protected, and then the information
is used in such a manner where it would allow companies a level
of comfort that that information--there is no reach-back
authority in a punitive fashion----
Mr. Molinaro [interposing]. Of course.
Mr. Rorick [continuing]. Then you would get great
participation. It would give us a great dataset to not only
look at trends, but then also identify individual reportings so
that we can share the lessons learned more broadly across the
industry.
Ms. Sames. And I fully agree. I mean, we do something
similar within the American Gas Association. We have a plastic
pipe database. It has over 150,000 failures. It is evaluated by
Government and industry and manufacturers. And we create a
status report about three times a year showing what we know
about failures. And it works.
So, if this is done correctly, it now gives you this wealth
of information that the industry and Government can utilize to
improve safety. On the other hand, if it is done incorrectly,
if there are fines and penalties for the submission, no one is
going to submit.
Mr. Molinaro. Agreed. And another provision I drafted and
we were able to secure in the reauthorization with my
colleague, Mr. Allred, directs PHMSA to complete a study and
rulemaking on how operators can use composite pipe safely to
transport new fuels like hydrogen. That will help us meet some
of our climate goals.
Mr. Rorick, could you just speak to the potential uses for
composite pipe and why it is important to get this rulemaking
accomplished?
Mr. Rorick. Yes, sir. So, as we discussed with
Representative DeSaulnier, we were part of the solution going
forward, and we certainly see hydrogen as having a role there.
Composite pipe has been used for decades now for repair jobs
and sleeves, et cetera, so, that piece of technology in
particular stands to be of particular benefit as we talk about
moving greater quantities of hydrogen.
Mr. Molinaro. Thank you. Thank you both.
Just to shift gears slightly, I have spent my entire life
in the Hudson River Valley, which means just by birth, we are
natural resource conservationists. But it always strikes me as
a bit comical that there are those who oppose the construction
of pipelines for the safe transportation of CO2 and natural gas
and other fuels, given that greenhouse gas emissions are
avoided altogether, transporting via pipeline rather than other
more traditional transportation methods.
Mr. Caram, could you just speak a little bit to that? I
always like to remind my friends back in New York why some of
the regulatory restrictions in New York for pipeline and the
distribution via pipelines is probably not the best policy.
Mr. Caram. I am sorry. Could you repeat the question?
Mr. Molinaro. Rather than--so, rulemaking in States like
New York limit--and of course, there are those who oppose the
use of pipeline for transportation of CO2, natural gas, instead
relying on the alternative transport options, which usually
lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions.
Mr. Caram. Got you. Yes, I think there are certainly lower
incident rates on pipelines per mile, as Deputy Administrator
Brown referenced earlier.
I think one thing that gets missed in that data is just how
devastating a failure can be from a pipeline just because of
the quantity that is released when there is a failure on a
pipeline. And so, I think that needs to be taken into account.
But my organization works very hard on ensuring the safety
of pipelines that are in the ground, and making sure that the
pipeline that is in someone's backyard is as safe as possible,
and that the community around it can feel that--not live in
fear of a failure.
Mr. Molinaro. Thank you.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr.
Graves, who does not serve on this committee, but he was waived
on this subcommittee.
So, you have 5 minutes, Mr. Graves. Good to see you.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. You, too. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you all for being here today.
Mr. Brown, I want to follow up on Congressman Burchett's
question. The National Research Council did an evaluation
looking at different modes of transportation, and Congressman
Burchett asked you a question related to that. So, I just want
to make sure I understand. Are pipelines the safest mode of
transportation when compared to other modes?
Mr. Brown. It is sort of a complicated question, but I
think, to your point, as far as the fewest number of incidents,
if you look at the volume, you would say yes, you would say
yes. But to Mr. Caram's point, the severity of an incident can
be tragic and, obviously, very severe.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. I absolutely agree with that.
Mr. Brown. Yes.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. I just--I want to make sure I
understand my reading of the National Research Council's
evaluation that, compared to truck and train and barge and
other things, it is the safest mode of transportation.
Mr. Brown. Yes. Those----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. We should never
stop striving to further and further improve safety. I want to
be clear on that.
Do you agree that the State of California uses oil and gas?
Mr. Brown. Yes, I have used it in the State of California.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Yes, I thought so. I am not sure I
understand why some folks will sit here and talk about
pipelines as this evil. Whenever their State uses it, science
shows it is the safest mode of transportation.
Let me be clear. I agree that we need to continue striving,
using technology, get better and better at safety and
perfecting this. But let's compare this to alternatives. I was
just looking up--I pulled up an article. Just for the city of
New York--just for the city of New York--according to the Fire
Department of New York, in 2023, lithium-ion batteries caused
267 fires, 150 injuries, and 18 deaths. That is just in New
York, just in 2023.
We can't sit here and pretend like--that by stopping
pipelines, there are all these other alternatives that are that
much better. That doesn't even include the fact that many of
the energy solutions that my friends from California are
talking about include mining--that have been proven, as Mr.
Stauber has talked about, slave labor, child labor, safety
infractions, deaths across the globe.
So, I think we need to be very thoughtful and careful about
pretending as though there are all of these other safer, better
options out there, and instead focus on what math and science
shows are the safest options, and make sure we are continuing
to learn from successes and failures, and continue to perfect.
Is that fair?
Mr. Brown. That is exactly what our agency does, because we
also regulate the hazardous materials transportation via truck,
train, plane, vessel, automobile, and drone.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. It sounds like it is the first
time you have ever said that. Thank you, I appreciate it.
Mr. Rorick, I would like to ask you a question. PHMSA
hasn't really made substantial changes in some of the class
location regulations in over 50 years. Can you talk a little
bit about how perhaps some updates or modernization there could
result in actual better safety outcomes?
Mr. Rorick. Yes, sir. So, the class location rules, or the
way they are currently designed in an outdated fashion,
essentially says that once a population, a certain population
is reached, that companies automatically have to pull those
pipelines out, regardless of whether or not they are safe or
they need to be pulled out.
First and foremost, we look out for the workers of the
communities in which we--we look out for the safety of the
communities in which we operate in, but also for the workers
that do our work. So, if we can avoid doing work where we don't
have to, particularly with heavy machinery, we want to do that.
Secondly, if we can use existing technologies, integrity
management technologies to maintain the same level of safety
and oftentimes find pipelines that don't need to be pulled out,
we don't need to purge that gas and spend hundreds of millions
of dollars pulling out pipe unnecessarily that we can then
redivert to integrity management programs.
And then lastly, sir, I would say that if we--that
annually, the amount of gas that occurs from blowdowns just to
do these pipe replacements exceeds 800 million standard cubic
feet of natural gas a year, which is the same amount of gas
that 10,000 homes use. If we can avoid that and still maintain
the same level of safety----
Mr. Graves of Louisiana [interrupting]. It could prevent
the emissions.
Mr. Rorick. That's true.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Another quick question, and I
apologize I am running out of time, but could you talk briefly
about the regulation of in-plant pipelines, as opposed to those
external to the boundaries?
Mr. Rorick. Yes. So, when the statute was originally
created, it was very specific in giving PHMSA the authority to
waive its authority over in-plant piping for liquid pipelines,
but it didn't provide the same level of clarity for natural gas
pipelines.
What we would look to see, or hope to see, is a
harmonization so that PHMSA has that same level of authority to
let OSHA, which currently manages the refineries, have that
same authority over the natural gas.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. In some cases we are seeing
regional PHMSA managers exercise jurisdiction whenever PHMSA
has headquarters, effectively----
Mr. Rorick [interrupting]. Yes, sir, and it is starting to
create some confusion in the industry.
Mr. Graves of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I am out of time,
but I just want to thank you.
Mr. Brown, I am concerned about what Mr. Rouzer brought up
about some of the deadlines in the law. I don't think your
agency has the discretion to determine when they are going to
complete something. If we write a law, our citizens don't have
the ability to choose when they are going to comply and when
they don't. And I think we need to work on better strategies to
actually comply.
I am out of time, I apologize and yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr.
Johnson for 5 minutes.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for
holding this very important hearing, and thank you to the
witnesses for appearing today.
Mr. Brown, pipelines often route hazardous materials
through densely populated areas, which can become public safety
emergencies in the event of a pipeline failure. In some events,
communities are not made aware of pipelines until something
goes wrong.
What obligation do pipeline operators have to inform the
public about location and likely risks of pipelines?
Mr. Brown. We have a host of requirements that we impose on
those operators to inform. So, there are signs, signage
requirements, there's emergency planning requirements,
emergency notification requirements, and those we are
constantly updating. Just last year--I am sorry, in 2022--we
updated those, we are working on further updates, as well. So,
that is something that we stay very focused on for precisely
the reasons you mentioned.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. Are pipeline operators
required to hold public meetings after a pipeline incident?
Mr. Brown. No, and that is something we have really taken
on as an agency. When the public doesn't have the information
and a serious incident occurs in their community, we have tried
to provide information that we have, but of course, we don't
operate the pipeline. We only oversee the operations. And so,
that is something that I think an operator, when there is an
incident that affects a community, that they should communicate
to the community and give a chance to the community to ask
those types of questions.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you.
Mr. Caram, the bipartisan pipeline safety reauthorization
bill focuses on the safety of the millions of miles of gas and
hazardous liquid pipelines that are currently in use and the
new pipelines required for hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The
bill asks for a study by the Government Accountability Office
on the need and ability to create a localized emergency alert
system in the event of pipeline accidents.
What information is needed for first responders when
responding to a pipeline incident?
Mr. Caram. Yes. The type of pipeline that failed, the
product that was in the pipeline that failed, the potential
impacted area of that failure, which homes and places could be
impacted by that failure. What kind of emergency efforts are
best? Is it shelter in place? Is it an evacuation?
And I think the need for such a system is made even more by
CO2 pipelines, because they can move so far away from a
pipeline, the plume after a failure, because sometimes people
should evacuate and sometimes maybe they should shelter in
place. And it is not a kind of a one-size-fits-all. The weather
affects what direction it could move, things like that.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Is the information needed by first
responders that you just outlined, is that information always
readily available? And where is it obtained from?
Mr. Caram. It is not always readily available. Some of that
information about the type of pipeline it is and some physical
characteristics of the pipeline and the location can be found
on the National Pipeline Mapping System, but other information
that might be particular to that specific failure would not be.
And first responders would need to rely on communication
from the operators to get that kind of information, and I think
that the two Denbury failures, one in Satartia and one in
Sulphur, shows what can happen when there is a breakdown there.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. Engaging with local
communities and stakeholders is crucial to raising awareness
about pipeline safety risks, and also building trust in
pipeline operators and regulators. The PIPES Act of 2023 even
creates a new Office of Public Engagement to educate local
governments, public safety organizations, pipeline operators,
and the public about pipeline safety, best practices, and
regulations. The goal is to ensure access to information by
facilitating conversations and addressing community concerns.
To promote transparency and accountability, how are you
able to bridge the gaps between industry stakeholders,
including public safety officials, smaller companies, and local
communities?
Mr. Caram. Well, I think there is still a big need for
public engagement, especially after failures. I think PHMSA has
made some real improvements there over the last few years, and
has visited communities both after a failure and where there is
a proposed new project, and that has been great to see. But I
think there is a lot of progress still to be made, and there is
definitely an appetite for it from the public.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, and I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. Are there any further
questions from any members of the committee that have not been
recognized?
Seeing none, this concludes our hearing today. I want to
thank you all for being here today.
I look forward, Mr. Brown, any questions that need to be
answered, I hope you can be timely with that in the next couple
of weeks. You should be able to do so.
This committee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:18 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Submissions for the Record

----------

Statement of Rob Benedict, Vice President, Petrochemicals and
Midstream, American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, Submitted for
the Record by Hon. Troy E. Nehls
The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) is a trade
association representing high-tech American refiners, petrochemical
manufacturers, and pipeline operators. AFPM members produce and deliver
the fuels and petrochemicals that make modern life possible and enable
people and the U.S. economy to thrive.
AFPM members rely on pipelines to transport feedstocks to their
facilities and products to consumers. Liquid fuel and natural gas are
the lifeblood of the American economy, pipelines are the veins.
Pipelines continue to be the safest and most efficient means of
transporting natural gas and petroleum products. The safety and
security of pipelines are important not only to the American economy,
but to the men and women who work to keep America moving. AFPM supports
the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration's (PHMSA)
mission ``to protect people and the environment by advancing the safe
transportation of energy and other hazardous materials that are
essential to our daily lives.''
Enhancing pipeline safety and security continue to be top
priorities for AFPM. We encourage efforts to ensure our nation's
pipeline system continues to operate safely and efficiently and
appreciate the Committee's introduction and passage of H.R. 6494, the
Promoting Innovation in Pipeline Efficiency and Safety (PIPES) Act of
2023. AFPM stands ready to support the development of this five-year
reauthorization of PHMSA's pipeline safety programs as it continues to
move through the legislative process.
We believe that H.R. 6494 could be improved with the creation of a
``safety zone'' around pipeline construction and repair operations to
protect pipeline workers and the general public. The pipeline safety
authority in Chapter 601 of title 49 does not contain any authority
concerning worker and public safety where pipeline construction or
repair activities are occurring, which could lead to potentially unsafe
conditions.
AFPM supports strengthening penalties and clarifying PHMSA's
existing authority for damaging, destroying, or impairing the
operations of pipeline facilities. Under current PHMSA authority, there
are inadequate penalties for vandalism of pipeline facilities, and
those in place are unused by PHMSA. Pipelines are critical assets that
must be protected.
Additionally, we support PHMSA establishing a voluntary information
sharing (VIS) system to gather, evaluate, and quantify critical
pipeline safety data and information to improve safety. This type of
system has proven beneficial in other sectors. Importantly, any VIS
system must include appropriate safe harbor provisions, that ensure
data are only used for the intended purpose of improving pipeline
safety.
While current federal pipeline safety standards already regulate
the design, construction, operation, maintenance and emergency response
for CO2 and hydrogen pipelines, the regulations could be updated to
ensure they reflect industry advancements. PHMSA should ensure these
regulations address specific safety concerns for these materials but
not be so burdensome that they stifle development of this critically
important infrastructure. Carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) has
been demonstrated to be an effective tool in reducing CO2 emissions.
Hybrid capture systems employed at ethanol facilities in the Midwest
can capture CO2 from the bioprocessing stream as well as from the heat
production stream to achieve further lower emissions. For CCUS to reach
its potential, we must have a modern regulatory framework.
Lastly, AFPM supports increased frequency of meetings of the
Technical Safety Standards Committees and the development of pipeline
safety enhancement programs. Technical Safety Standards Committees are
integral to the advancement of pipeline safety and have proven to
result in good policy. AFPM has long been a supporter of pilot programs
as they are important in testing the efficacy of safety innovations and
advanced technologies. Though they can be useful, it is important that
pilot programs are not overly restrictive, and that they encourage
industry to use them.
We appreciate your leadership on this critical issue and look
forward to working with lawmakers as the legislative process moves
forward.

The Honorable Frederica S. Wilson,
Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials, U.S.
House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chair Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, Chair Nehls, and Ranking
Member Wilson:
Thank you for your continued leadership and work to make our
nation's systems of pipelines safer and more reliable. In March 2023,
my community experienced the devastating natural gas-fueled explosion
at the R.M. Palmer Company chocolate factory in West Reading,
Pennsylvania, which took the lives of seven workers, injured eleven
people, displaced three families, and destroyed property. On account of
this tragedy, I am writing in follow up to the Subcommittee on
Railroad, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials' May 7th hearing on the
reauthorization of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration (PHMSA). Specifically, I want to emphasize testimony
regarding action that Congress must take to regulate ``Aldyl A,'' which
is the pipeline material identified by the National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB) to have leaked natural gas at the West Reading
explosion site. Accordingly, I urge you to take requisite action to
protect lives from future Aldyl A-related incidents as outlined in
bipartisan legislation I have proposed as you advance your Committee's
pipeline safety reauthorization legislation.
As you know, the NTSB is conducting a comprehensive investigation
into the R.M. Palmer factory explosion. On May 2, 2023, NTSB issued its
preliminary findings report, which indicated ``that natural gas was
leaking from a DuPont Aldyl A service tee that was installed in 1982.''
\1\ Unfortunately, this is not a new issue. In 1999, 2002, and again in
2007, PHMSA identified Aldyl A as a pipe material with ``poor
performance histories relative to brittle-like cracking.'' \2\ It is
far past time that Congress take action to regulate this dangerous
material to prevent any future loss of life and devastation to our
communities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the May 7th Subcommittee hearing, key testimony was given to
emphasize the importance of action to regulate Aldyl A.\3\ In his
written testimony, Mr. Bill Caram, Executive Director of the Pipeline
Safety Trust, stated, ``Pipeline industry-developed standards also call
attention to the integrity problems with this particular type of
service tee, though these standards are also voluntary. A recent PHMSA
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking would specifically add Aldyl A pipe to
distribution pipeline operator's integrity management programs, asking
operators to consider the risk of the presence of this material in
their system. At what point do we go beyond recommending operators
remove problematic materials from their systems and make it explicitly
illegal for this material to be part of our nation's pipelines? Please
remember that there are 7 dinner tables have had an empty seat since
that day.'' \4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
While we cannot fix the past, Congress has a responsibility to take
action to prevent disasters like the one in my community from ever
happening again. That is why I introduced my bipartisan legislation,
the Aldyl A Hazard Reduction and Community Safety Act (H.R.5638) \5\,
with my fellow Berks County colleague Rep. Dan Meuser. If enacted, our
bill would direct PHMSA to require operators in high consequence areas
to identify existing Aldyl A and then submit documentation about its
usage to PHMSA. It directs PHMSA to issue standards for the removal of
Aldyl A at pressurized locations in high consequence areas within 5
years, including consideration for minimizing costs and service
disruptions. This will undoubtedly save lives and help prevent another
deadly Aldyl A-related tragedy.

I appreciate your attention to the critical testimony on the
circumstances surrounding the tragic explosion in West Reading
delivered during the Subcommittee hearing. Once again, I urge you to
take action to prevent another Aldyl A-related incident and stand ready
to work with you to advance my bipartisan legislation.
Sincerely,
Chrissy Houlahan,
Member of Congress.

Appendix

----------

Questions to Tristan Brown, Deputy Administrator, Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, U.S. Department of
Transportation, from Hon. Troy E. Nehls

Question 1. Deputy Administrator Brown, your written testimony for
this hearing was not provided to Members until after 10:00 p.m. the
night before the hearing, denying Members of this Committee time to
adequately review your testimony in preparation for this hearing.
Question 1.a. Why did PHMSA take so long to provide the testimony
to Members of the Committee?
Answer. Preparing testimony involves an extensive departmental and
interagency review process. These steps are essential to ensure the
accuracy and comprehensiveness of the information included in the
testimony of a witness from the Executive Branch. Unfortunately, this
took longer than anticipated for my testimony, affecting the timeliness
of its submission to the Committee.

Question 1.b. Given the extremely late submission of your
testimony, do you commit to providing responses to Members' questions
for the record in two weeks?
Answer. It is always PHMSA's intent to provide information
requested by individual members of Congress and our oversight
committees within the timeframes specified. As stated during the
hearing, PHMSA is also available and responsive to requests for
information via phone calls, briefings, and email to ensure Congress
has the information it needs to complete its legislative activities.
Responding to Questions for the Record involves an extensive
departmental and interagency review process. These steps are essential
to ensure the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the information
included in responses from an agency within the Executive Branch.
Unfortunately, this took longer than anticipated, affecting the
timeliness of submitting these responses to the Committee.

Question 2. Adequate staffing for PHMSA has always been a concern
for Congress. That is why the PIPES Act of 2020 mandated PHMSA maintain
a certain number of pipeline inspectors on staff.
Question 2.a. Has PHMSA met these numbers?
Answer. As noted in my testimony, with a red-hot economy and
historically competitive job market, PHMSA faces fierce hiring
competition from the private sector and other Federal agencies who are
also competing with the same limited talent pools. In 2023, 43% of
pipeline inspection and enforcement job offers were declined and in
2024, the percentage increased to 44%. PHMSA's safety inspections
require engineers or technical staff that are willing to spend up to
50% of their time traveling to remote parts of the U.S. and perform
physically demanding work. Regardless, PHMSA continues to explore ways
to continue to improve the agency's hiring and recruitment to make it
both more efficient and effective in recruiting and retaining talented
applicants.
PHMSA is grateful for the PIPES Act of 2020, which supported the
use of incentives to improve efforts to attract and retain a talented
pool of professionals. PHMSA has undertaken new recruitment and
retention efforts--in coordination with the Office of Personnel
Management--including developing new tuition reimbursement efforts and
utilizing new online recruitment methods. Specifically, special salary
rates were implemented in 2023 and PHMSA continues to implement
programs to take advantage of all available hiring flexibilities.

Question 2.b. How many pipeline inspectors are currently employed
by PHMSA?
Answer. As of June 3, there are 224 inspection and enforcement
staff onboard with an additional 10 candidates going through the
security process.

Question 3. The PIPES Act of 2023, which this Committee passed on a
bipartisan basis, authorizes PHMSA to hire up to 30 additional
employees who have advanced technical expertise to complete rulemakings
and Congressional mandates. How might these additional positions
address PHMSA's backlog of outstanding rulemakings?
Answer. The additional positions could enable PHMSA to develop and
implement rulemaking mandates more expeditiously. Effective rulemaking
requires many different technical skills. Engineers and Physical
Scientists provide technical support and analysis in support of
rulemaking and improvement of reliability and serviceability of the
pipeline transportation network. Transportation Specialists perform
research and analysis related to the development of regulatory changes
and interpretation of regulations, as well as in the development of
proposed and final rulemaking documents, including environmental
reviews and economic impact statements, evaluation of public comments,
and incorporation of legal input on proposed regulatory changes.
Attorneys provide legal advice in the development of rulemaking,
implementation guidance, and defense of the same from administrative
and appellate litigation. Economists conduct economic research to
understand economic and industry trends that influence risks to
pipelines, transportation of hazardous materials, and related
industries, as well as develop data models to evaluate safety risks and
assess costs, benefits, efficiency, and impacts of PHMSA's regulatory
and safety programs. Technical Writers provide writing and editorial
support in the development of materials to respond to congressional
reports, mandates, and rulemaking requirements. All of these positions
work together to ensure rulemakings are technically sound and are
developed in consideration of existing regulatory requirements, will
achieve the desired result, and are defensible against litigation.
PHMSA could utilize additional positions to address outstanding and
upcoming rulemakings as expeditiously as possible.

Question 4. In May 2023, PHMSA published a proposed rule on leak
detection and repair requirements for pipeline operators. What is the
status of this proposed rule and when does PHMSA expect it to be
published?
Answer. In order to meet its statutory obligation, PHMSA held two
gas pipeline advisory committee (GPAC) meetings on the proposed rule
for leak detection and repair requirements. Following the last GPAC
meeting in March 2024, stakeholders were given 30 days to provide
public comments on the GPAC proceedings related to the proposed rule.
The comment period for the proposed rule closed on April 29, 2024, and
PHMSA is now working to consolidate and respond to all GPAC
recommendations and public comments received and is on track to publish
the final rule by January 2025. The schedule for all outstanding
congressionally mandated rulemakings can be found on the PIPES Act 2020
Web Chart, located on PHMSA's website.

Question 5. Please detail how PHMSA has worked with the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to harmonize its proposed Leak
Detection and Repair Rule with similar regulations at EPA.
Answer. PHMSA has met with different offices within EPA to better
understand their published leak data associated with pipeline
infrastructure and the technology solutions they considered to address
methane abatement in order to synchronize our rulemakings and to
minimize or eliminate all inconsistencies and duplication.
PHMSA also notes that this rulemaking is subject to the interagency
review process set forth in Executive Order 12866. As part of that
process, PHMSA provided briefings on the NPRM for personnel from EPA
and other agencies on the content of the rulemaking and responded to
multiple rounds of comments on the draft rulemaking package from
Executive Branch agencies (including, but not limited to, EPA). Further
opportunity for input from EPA and other agencies will be provided as
part of the Executive Order 12866 review of the final rule.

Question 6. The proposed Leak Detection and Repair Rule includes a
requirement for gathering line operators to participate in the national
pipeline mapping system (NPMS), despite the PIPES Act of 2020 providing
no such authorization.
Question 6.a. Please detail where in the PIPES Act of 2020 PHMSA
draw its authorization for including gathering lines in the NPMS.
Answer. In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for the Gas
Pipeline Leak Detection and Repair rulemaking (RIN2137-AF51), PHMSA
states that it has statutory authority pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 60117(c)
to extend NPMS reporting requirements at 49 CFR 191.29 to offshore,
Type A, Type B, and Type C gas gathering pipelines so as to better
inform PHMSA's regulatory oversight of those facilities. See 88 FR at
31946-47, 31964-65. PHMSA also notes that, insofar as the NPRM
identifies safety and environmental benefits from its proposed
extension of the NPMS to those gas gathering facilities, PHMSA's broad
safety authority at 49 U.S.C. 60102 could provide an alternative
statutory basis for such an extension. See 88 FR at 31946-47.

Question 6.b. Does PHMSA intend to keep this directive in the final
rule?
Answer. PHMSA has received numerous comments--both in opposition to
and in support of--its proposed extension of NPMS reporting
requirements at 49 CFR 191.29. PHMSA is carefully reviewing the
entirety of the administrative record on this issue in evaluating
whether to codify this proposal in its forthcoming final rule in the
Gas Pipeline Leak Detection and Repair rulemaking (RIN2137-AF51).

Question 7. PHMSA's authority to administer the NPMS is codified at
49 U.S.C. Sec.  60132. Subsection (a) of Sec.  60132 states that ``the
operator of a pipeline facility (except distribution lines and
gathering lines)'' shall submit geospatial data and other information
to the NPMS. Do you believe this statute gives PHMSA authority to
require gathering and distribution operators to submit information for
the NPMS?
Answer. Section 60132(a) does not give PHMSA authority, it is a
self-executing mandate requiring operators of certain pipeline
facilities to submit geospatial information to PHMSA ``[n]ot later than
6 months after the date of enactment of this section.'' Section
60132(a) does not preclude PHMSA from requiring operators of
distribution or gathering facilities to submit geospatial data under
Sec.  60117(c).
As explained in response to Chairman Nehls' question 6(a), PHMSA
understands it has the authority under several provisions of the
Pipeline Safety Laws to extend NPMS reporting requirements at 49 CFR
191.29 to gas gathering pipelines. Similarly, PHMSA understands that
neither of the statutory provisions referenced in that earlier response
prohibit PHMSA from extending the NPMS to gas distribution lines as
well if PHMSA determines such an extension is necessary for public
safety or environmental protection (49 U.S.C. 60102) or to ensure
compliance with standards or orders issued by PHMSA (49 U.S.C. 60117).

Question 8. Since the creation of the NPMS, has PHMSA ever required
distribution or gathering lines to submit information for the NPMS? If
so, please detail when PHMSA collected that information.
Answer. PHMSA has never required operators to submit geospatial
information for gas distribution or gas gathering pipeline facilities
but does require submission of NPMS data for regulated rural onshore
hazardous liquid gathering lines.
PHMSA first regulated hazardous liquid gathering pipeline
facilities in Docket PHMSA-RSPA-2003-15864, RIN 2137-AD98, Protecting
Unusually Sensitive Areas from Rural Onshore Hazardous Liquid Gathering
Lines and Low-Stress Lines. In the 2008 final rule, operators of
regulated rural onshore hazardous liquid gathering lines were required
to comply with 49 CFR part 195 subpart B reporting requirements no
later than January 3, 2009. In Docket PHMSA-2010-0026, RIN 2137-AE59,
Miscellaneous Changes to Pipeline Safety Regulations, a 2015 final rule
amended PHMSA regulations to require operators of hazardous liquid
pipeline facilities to submit geospatial data to PHMSA each year by
June 15. The earliest date PHMSA required operators of regulated rural
onshore hazardous liquid gathering lines to submit geospatial data was
June 15, 2016.

Question 9. 49 U.S.C. Sec.  60117(c) states that ``The Secretary
may require owners and operators of gathering lines to provide the
Secretary information pertinent to the Secretary's ability to make a
determination as to whether and to what extent to regulate gathering
lines.''
Do you believe 49 U.S.C. Sec.  60117(c) gives PHMSA authority to
require gathering lines to submit information to the NPMS? Please
explain your position.
Answer. As explained in the response to Chairman Nehls' question
6(a), PHMSA understands it has the authority under several provisions
of the Pipeline Safety Laws to extend NPMS reporting requirements at 49
CFR 191.29 to gas gathering pipelines, including 49 U.S.C. 60117(c).

Question 10. Do you believe PHMSA would require new statutory
authority to require gathering and distribution lines to submit
information to be included in the NPMS? Please explain your position.
Answer. As explained in responses to Chairman Nehls' questions 6(a)
and 7, PHMSA understands it has the authority under several provisions
of the Pipeline Safety Laws to extend NPMS reporting requirements at 49
CFR 191.29 to gas gathering and distribution pipelines.

Question 11. Do you believe the PIPES Act of 2020 provides
authority to PHMSA to include liquified natural gas (LNG) facilities to
be included in the proposed Leak Detection and Repair rule? If so,
please detail where in the PIPES Act of 2020, or in statute, this
authorization is located?
Answer. In its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for the Gas
Pipeline Leak Detection and Repair rulemaking (RIN2137-AF51), PHMSA
states that several of its proposed amendments to 49 CFR part 193
requirements governing liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities codify a
self-executing statutory mandate within section 114 of the PIPES Act of
2020 for operators of those and other gas pipeline facilities to update
their inspection and maintenance procedures to ``minimize releases of
natural gas.'' See 88 FR at 31947-48. PHMSA also has broad authority
under 49 U.S.C. 60102(a) (reinforced in 49 U.S.C. 60103(d)) to
promulgate operating and maintenance safety standards for LNG
facilities, including the enhanced leakage survey standards proposed in
the NPRM.

Question 12. PHMSA held two Gas Pipeline Advisory Committee (GPAC)
meetings in November 2023 and March 2024 on the Leak Detection and
Repair proposed rule. GPAC meetings are required by statute to help
provide PHMSA guidance on writing highly technical rules. Given the
length of these meetings and complicated nature of this proposed rule,
will PHMSA provide an extension of the comment period? If not, please
justify PHMSA's position.
Answer. PHMSA provided the public a 90-day comment period after
publication of the Leak Detection and Repair proposed rule. The public
had close to 150 additional days to comment following the GPAC meeting
in November of 2023, where the most difficult issues relative to the
rulemaking were addressed. PHMSA believes that the 30 days provided for
the public to comment following the March 2024 GPAC meeting was ample
time to comment on the issues discussed at that meeting.
Additionally, PHMSA received comments from the public opposing the
extension of the comment period for GPAC proceedings pertaining to the
Leak Detection and Repair NPRM. Noting that the rule is urgently needed
to improve safety and reduce methane emissions across the millions of
miles of pipelines in the Unites States and that the Protecting Our
Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 directed
PHMSA to finalize advanced leak detection and repair standards by
December 2021, commenters urged PHMSA to swiftly finalize the proposed
measures to improve public safety, arguing that extending the comment
period for GPAC proceedings pertaining to the Leak Detection and Repair
NPRM could further delay PHMSA's finalization of that rule.

Question 13. After Congress reached bipartisan agreement on a
technology pilot demonstration program in the PIPES Act of 2020,
additional conditions PHMSA imposed through guidance subsequently
resulted in no technology pilots proposed or undertaken.
Question 13.a. What changes or actions has PHMSA taken since our
last hearing to improve this program?
Answer. As mandated by 49 U.S.C. 60142(c)(2), the Pipeline Safety
Enhancement Program (PSEP) expired three years after enactment of the
PIPES Act of 2020, December 2023. Prior to expiration of the program,
PHMSA expressed a willingness, including at the March 2023 T&I hearing,
to work with committee members and stakeholders to improve the
application process. However, no applicants came forward to participate
in the program prior to its expiration. PHMSA stands ready to work with
operators to advance modern technological advancements which can
continue to be explored through the special permit process and through
other provisions of the pipeline safety regulations using 49 CFR part
192.18.

Question 13.b. Pipeline safety deserves the benefits of modern
technological advances. What can PHMSA do to reduce barriers to
demonstrating the benefits of pipeline safety technology?
Answer. PHMSA agrees new technologies can improve pipeline safety.
However, use of unproven technology cannot be allowed to expose the
public or the environment to unreasonable risk.
49 U.S.C. 60142 authorized PHMSA to allow testing of innovative
technologies and operational practices and required under subsection
(d) that any testing program approved must provide more robust
protection of public safety and the environment than the existing
Federal pipeline safety regulations. PHMSA followed congressional
direction by utilizing the review process of the existing special
permit (waiver) program (see 49 U.S.C. 60142(d)(2)(A)), and PHMSA
remained amenable to working with interested operators to alleviate
some of the application requirements while ensuring that an equivalent
level of public and environmental safety was being maintained by any
new technologies or operational practices being implemented on in-
service, or active, pipelines.
PHMSA remains open to working with interested operators to
establish the safety of modern technological advances.

Question 14. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
advanced a pipeline safety reauthorization bill, H.R. 6494, that
contains an important provision that will increase pipeline safety and
reduce methane emissions. The provision would address maximum allowable
operating pressure records for older pipelines. Please elaborate on the
importance of this provision, given its safety and environmental
benefits.
Answer. In October 2019, PHMSA issued the Pipeline Safety: Safety
of Gas Transmission Pipelines: MAOP Reconfirmation, Expansion of
Assessment Requirements, and Other Related Amendments. This rule,
addressing several congressional mandates from the Pipeline Safety,
Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, requires operators
of certain onshore steel gas transmission pipeline segments to
reconfirm the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) of those
segments where the records needed to substantiate their current MAOP
are not traceable, verifiable, and complete. Records to confirm, or
reconfirm, MAOP include pressure test records or material property
records that verify the MAOP is appropriate for the pipeline. Having
accurate and reliable asset data (records) is important to ensuring
safe and reliable operations.
PHMSA has worked with stakeholders on determining a process to
address the issues regarding identifying acceptable records for older
pipelines. PHMSA has worked collaboratively with stakeholders on this
process since implementation of the rulemaking and continues to do so.

Question 15. Is PHMSA considering an update to the potential impact
radius, which remains a highly effective tool to prioritize risk and
ensure the safety of our Nation's natural gas pipeline system, as
reported by Government Accountability Office (GAO) earlier this month?
Question 15.a. Did the agency hold a public meeting on the
potential impact radius (PIR) in December 2022 where PHMSA reaffirmed
its efficacy and application?
Answer. PHMSA conducted a public meeting on December 13-15, 2022,
that included discussion of the PIR. More details about the public
meeting can be found on PHMSA's website at this link: https://primis-
meetings.phmsa.dot.gov/archive/MtgHome.mtg@mtg=161.html

Question 15.b. What new data or engineering analyses support a
change in the PIR?
Answer. During PHMSA's December 13-15, 2022, public meeting
(https://primis-meetings.phmsa.dot.gov/archive/
MtgHome.mtg@mtg=161.html) in Houston, Texas, there were two
presentations that touched on and provided information related to
potential impact radius (PIR), including one related to the National
Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) recommendation for PHMSA to
consider a revision to the calculation methodology used in the pipeline
safety regulations to determine PIR (see NTSB Safety Recommendation P-
22-001); and a second presentation that provided information on the
background for development and validation of the PIR.
Following the public meeting PHMSA established a team to review the
current potential impact radius (PIR) calculation methodology, the
available accident data, and the human response data to determine if
revisions to the pipeline safety regulations are required. PHMSA has
completed its review of data and is in the process of discussing
options regarding methodology to respond to the NTSB's recommendation.
If a rulemaking initiative is established, all data reviewed by PHMSA's
team will be included in the docket.

Question 16. Section 25 of H.R. 6494, the PIPES Act of 2023
includes direction for PHMSA to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(NPRM) on the transportation of gaseous state carbon dioxide by
pipeline and includes other direction for such rulemaking.
Question 16.a. PHMSA is in the process of issuing an NPRM on carbon
dioxide transportation. Does the NPRM incorporate provisions of H.R.
6494? If so, which provisions? Are there any provisions excluded?
Answer. PHMSA notes that its draft Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(NPRM) for its Safety of Carbon Dioxide and Hazardous Liquid Pipelines
rulemaking (RIN2137-AF60) is currently in interagency review pursuant
to Executive Order 12866. PHMSA is therefore constrained by regulation
(49 CFR part 5.5) and Departmental policy (see https://
www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2022-04/Guidance-on-
Communication-with-Parties-outside-of-the-Federal-Executive-Branch-
%28Ex-Parte-Communications%29.pdf) from disclosing the content of that
forthcoming NPRM to persons outside the Executive Branch.

Question 16.b. Assuming this legislation is enacted into law, how
will PHMSA incorporate the bill's direction into a NPRM or Final Rule?
Answer. PHMSA seeks to comply with applicable law and will
endeavor--consistent with the procedural requirements of the Pipeline
Safety Laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.) and the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. 500 et seq.)--to reconcile the contents of its
forthcoming NPRM and any final rule with Congressional statute.

Questions to Tristan Brown, Deputy Administrator, Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, U.S. Department of
Transportation, from Hon. Frederica S. Wilson

Question 1. For the record, could you state what has been the
leading cause of serious, significant, and all pipeline incidents over
the last 20 years, and the last 3 years? Where do excavation damage
incidents rank among leading causes?
Answer. Excavation damage is a leading cause of serious pipeline
incidents for all pipeline system types, as of 6/18/24. Below is a
breakdown for all incidents. Serious Incidents are the most impactful
to people and include fatalities or injuries requiring inpatient
hospitalization. Significant incidents are a broader category of
incidents, including all serious incidents and events with additional
economical or environmental consequences. More specifically,
significant incidents include the following:
1. Fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
2. $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
3.  Highly volatile liquid releases of 5 barrels or more or other
liquid releases of 50 barrels or more

Questions to Tristan Brown, Deputy Administrator, Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, U.S. Department of
Transportation, from Hon. David Rouzer

Question 1. How long has PHMSA investigated both thermite and
thermite technology?
Answer. PHMSA began formally investigating thermite and thermite
technology on September 27, 2018, with the first Task Order to
Southwest Research Institute. Although PHMSA had previously received
questions relating to thermite classifications dating back to when the
agency was the Research and Special Projects Administration (RSPA), the
impetus leading to formal research efforts was an email PHMSA received
from one of our third-party explosive testing agencies on March 4,
2016. Subsequently PHMSA had discussions with other explosive testing
agencies, Federal agencies including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the Department of Defense (DOD), and
international transport regulators regarding how thermites should be
considered under the definitions for explosives and pyrotechnics and
ultimately how such materials should be classed.

Question 2. On September 22, 2023, PHMSA released an interim
thermite policy stating it does not have the force and effect of law.
Why did PHMSA not follow the Administrative Procedure Act when
generating this policy?
Answer. On September 22, 2023, PHMSA issued a Notice of Explanation
of how it has reviewed and classified previous thermite mixtures. Since
initiating its research into thermite classification, PHMSA has sought
to provide regulatory relief by reclassifying certain thermite
substances, which meet PHMSA's definition of Class 1 explosives, as
Division 4.1 flammable solids pursuant to the Associate Administrator's
existing authority under 49 CFR Sec.  173.56(i). This notice explained
what data PHMSA has analyzed and found convincing when reclassifying
thermite substances. This notice was only intended to provide clarity
for how PHMSA has treated and reviewed previous requests while we
complete the ongoing research to determine proper testing and criteria
required to address the safe transportation of thermite formulations.
While PHMSA did not issue its policy through the notice and comment
period, its actions were still consistent with the Administrative
Procedure Act.

Question 3. Will domestic manufacturers of thermite be held
accountable for the policy?
Answer. PHMSA applies the same standards for classification of
explosives, including the thermite policy, to all applicants, whether
domestic or foreign.

Question 4. Why would PHMSA, with the September 2023 Safety
Management Service (SMS) research, state that all thermites are
provisionally considered explosive?
Answer. Thermites meet the regulatory definition of an explosive
under the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) at 49 CFR 173.50(a) and
the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods
Section 2.1.1. The SMS research report confirmed this, stating ``It is
the recommendation of SMS that thermite powders, which are manufactured
with the view to producing a pyrotechnic effect, be classed into Class
1 in the condition and form in which they are offered for transport . .
.''
As noted above, PHMSA has also been engaged with other foreign
competent authorities to promote an internationally harmonized approach
toward thermite regulation. In discussion with several of these
competent authorities, it was the unanimous opinion that thermite
materials are appropriately placed within the class of explosives
(Class 1) as they meet both of the HMR and UN definitions of
explosives.

Question 5. If you believe thermites meet the definition of a
pyrotechnic substance, wouldn't this necessitate all Class 4 flammable
solids also meet the definition ( . . . create light, heat, smoke . .
.)?
Answer. While pyrotechnic substances and flammable solids are both
capable of creating light, heat, smoke, etc., they differ in that
pyrotechnic substances contain a combination of both fuel and oxidizer
and are thus self-sustaining and will continue to react without an
external oxygen source, whereas flammable solids are merely fuels that
require external supplies of oxygen to sustain combustion. Once
thermites are initiated, they cannot be extinguished by most
traditional means.

Question 6. If a thermite manufacturer can produce a stable mixture
that can be proven through UN testing, why are you penalizing
innovation over a definition (pyrotechnic substance)?
Answer. PHMSA is not penalizing any manufacturer of pyrotechnic
substances, only seeking to apply the hazardous materials
transportation regulations safely andconsistently. All substances that
have a pyrotechnic effect remain in Class 1 by definition unless they
are diluted or desensitized from their pure state. This approach has
been harmonized internationally across foreign competent authorities to
ensure accurate, fair, and consistent classification of explosives.
Under the current PHMSA interim thermite policy, manufacturers of
certain thermite substances that have been properly examined can
request regulatory relief to be shipped as a Division 4.1, flammable
solid.

Question 7. Why did you allow a foreign company (SPEX), which does
not conduct business in the U.S., to impact your view of thermites when
you have domestic manufacturers with decades of experience?
Answer. No single company influenced PHMSA's view of thermites or
their classification. In February 2022, SPEX reached out to PHMSA
technical staff to discuss thermite classification, testing, and the
relationship of the interim policy and the published letters of
interpretation. SPEX received responses to their inquiries on how
explosive definitions and testing schemes apply to thermite substances
and articles that were commensurate with how PHMSA regularly responds
to outside stakeholders requesting insight or guidance on how the HMR
applies to specific situations. SPEX's inquiries did not impact PHMSA's
technical opinion or guidance, and PHMSA did not provide information to
SPEX specific to any particular manufacturer or product. PHMSA has also
had informational meetings with domestic manufacturers (i.e., MCR Oil
Tools, Chammas Plasma Cutters, Goldschmidt, etc.) to discuss their
process, materials, and articles.

Question 8. How many injuries and/or deaths have occurred in the
U.S. due to commercial thermites within the last 30 years?
Answer. PHMSA only collects data on incidents involving the
commercial transportation of hazardous materials. Of those, there are
approximately 10 transportation incidents per year involving thermite
or thermite-like materials, each causing on average about $7,000 in
damages. Ninety percent of these incidents occurred on the highway, and
none in the last thirty years resulted in injury or death.

Question 9. Only 3 of the 8 mixtures were commercial products in
the SMS report about thermites. Do you believe it's a sound decision to
make a blanket ruling on thermite technology based on test results of
non-commercial grade thermites?
Answer. The SMS research included some worst-case scenarios for
thermite formulations to delineate how particle size, morphology,
packaging, and chemical composition impact behavior. Their results
confirmed the ability for some thermite formulations to detonate, and
it was important that SMS design the study materials to explore how
these variables interact in either accelerating or slowing the relative
reactivity for those thermite formulations. SMS also performed several
large-scale tests with commercially produced thermites in shipping
containers and aircraft fuselage to understand the behavior and hazards
of palletized transport of thermites subjected to credible accident
scenario initiation methods (e.g., external fire).

Question 10. Have you contacted the U.S. manufacturers of thermite
technology to understand how a Class 1 explosive classification would
affect their business and industry?
Answer. The agency does routinely, and frequently, engage with
regulated stakeholders through public meetings, industry trade groups,
specialized consultants, and by request from individual stakeholders.
The agency also provides letters of interpretation, on request, on how
the regulations should be interpreted to specific cases and takes
consideration of public comments made on all rulemakings. PHMSA has
also had informational meetings with domestic manufacturers (i.e., MCR
Oil Tools, Chammas Plasma Cutters, Goldschmidt, etc.) to discuss their
processes, materials, and articles.

Questions to Tristan Brown, Deputy Administrator, Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, U.S. Department of
Transportation, from Hon. Bruce Westerman

Question 1. Mr. Brown, my understanding is the Gas Pipeline
Advisory Committee met in March to discuss PHMSA's proposed leak
detection and repair rulemaking. The GPAC recommended several changes
to the proposed rule to ensure it is technically feasible, reasonable,
cost-effective, and practicable.
Will you commit to the Committee that you and your staff will
seriously consider the GPAC's recommendations as you revise the
proposed rule?
Answer. PHMSA will consider all of the GPAC's recommendations and
the comments received during the open comment periods, as we prepare
the final rule.

Question 2. The EPA has finalized several rules recently that apply
to emissions in the oil and natural gas sector. I am concerned that
inconsistent regulations between EPA and PHMSA will place undue burden
on the industry and smaller independent companies in particular.
At the very least, will you commit to ensuring consistency between
EPA's regulations and PHMSA's ultimate leak detection and repair final
rule?
Answer. PHMSA is committed to ensuring consistency between EPA
regulations and our final rule. PHMSA also notes that this rulemaking
is subject to the interagency review process set forth in Executive
Order 12866; as part of that process, PHMSA provided briefings on the
NPRM for personnel from EPA and other agencies on the content of the
rulemaking, and responded to multiple rounds of comments on the draft
rulemaking package from the Office of Management and Budget, and
diverse Executive Branch agencies (including, but not limited to, EPA).
Further opportunity for input from EPA and other agencies will be
provided as part of the Executive Order 12866 review of the final rule.

Questions to Tristan Brown, Deputy Administrator, Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, U.S. Department of
Transportation, from Hon. Tracey Mann

Question 1. Representative Pete Stauber (R-MN) asked Deputy
Administrator Brown during the hearing about PHMSA holding an
additional Gas Pipeline Advisory Committee (GPAC) meeting regarding the
Class Location Rule. Deputy Administrator Brown answered that the GPAC
had already completed its work on the rule. However, Representative
Stauber was referencing a consensus reached during the March 2024 Class
Location GPAC meeting where the advisory committee voted by
supermajority threshold to meet again on the rulemaking within one
year.
Question 1.a. Can PHMSA commit to holding the next GPAC meeting on
the Class Location Rule before March 2025?
Question 1.b. If not, what is preventing PHMSA from doing so?
Question 1.c. Will this second GPAC meeting require a supplemental
notice and comment period?
Answer to 1.a., 1.b., & 1.c. During the Class Location GPAC meeting
in March 2024, the GPAC provided the following recommendation to PHMSA:
i  PHMSA should continue to review the class location change
requirements for possible future rulemaking action.
ii  PHMSA, within 12 months, hold a GPAC meeting on the concepts
and history of the class location change requirements and how they
interact with 49 CFR subpart O.

The meeting request from the GPAC was not directly related to the
notice of proposed rulemaking discussed during the advisory committee
meeting, ``Pipeline safety: Class Location Change Requirements.'' The
request was, however, related to the concepts and history of the class
location change requirements and how they interact with existing
regulatory requirements. PHMSA fully intends to adhere to the GPAC
request and hold a meeting.

Question 2. Industry recently calculated that the Class Location
Rule will reduce 28 times the amount of released methane as the
proposed Leak Detection and Repair Rule would across the gas
transmission sector. In addition to eliminating up to 800 million cubic
feet of natural gas releases annually due to class change pipe
replacements, the rule will significantly increase safety by applying
integrity management, the highest standard of care, to thousands of
miles of additional pipe.
Question 2.a. What assurances can PHMSA provide that the agency is
prioritizing completion of this important rulemaking, which advances
safety and environmental objectives?
Question 2.b. How soon can the agency issue a final rule?
Question 2.c. With the significant improvement in safety and
environmental impacts, why isn't the Class Location Rule being
prioritized over other rulemakings?
Answer to 2.a., 2.b., & 2.c. The 2020 PIPES Act had nearly double
the number of mandates as the 2016 PIPES Act. Nevertheless, PHMSA has
swiftly worked to complete these directives. A final Class Location
Rule needs to be very carefully considered to provide protection
against risks to life and property posed by pipeline transportation.

Question 3. Representative David Rouzer (R-NC) asked Deputy
Administrator Brown during the hearing several questions about the Leak
Detection and Repair (LDAR) proposed rule. Please provide more detail
regarding the following questions.
Question 3.a. Deputy Administrator Brown stated that the agency
will likely complete the rule at the end of the year. Can PHMSA please
be more specific on timing? Are there certain milestones PHMSA is
working to achieve?
Answer. PHMSA is on track to publish a final rule by January 2025.
As shown in the PIPES Act Web Chart (see: https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/
legislative-mandates/pipes-act-web-chart), PHMSA anticipates delivering
the final rule to the Office of the Secretary of Transportation this
summer and to the Office of Management and Budget by the fall.

Question 3.b. Deputy Administrator Brown stated that the White
House and the Council on Environmental Quality had minimal involvement
in the proposed rule but expected the standard interagency review
process for other governmental bodies to provide feedback on the final
rule. Can PHMSA please share who will be reviewing the final rule
including, but not limited to the following agencies and offices: the
Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of the Secretary, the Office
of Management and Budget, the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, the Council on Environmental Quality, and the White House?
Answer. Consistent with Department of Transportation Order 2100.6A
and the interagency review process established in Executive Order
12866, PHMSA expects its forthcoming draft rulemaking package for the
Gas Pipeline Leak Detection and Repair rulemaking (RIN2137-AF51) will
be reviewed by personnel in the DOT Office of the Secretary (OST), and
across the Executive Branch--including (but not limited to) personnel
from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of
Management and Budget, and other Executive Branch offices and agencies.

Question 3.c. On April 15, 2024, PHMSA recently denied a reasonable
request from the entire gas pipeline industry to extend the comment
period following the GPAC meeting for the LDAR rule. Given that this is
one of the largest rulemakings PHMSA has undertaken in years and
considering there were only about two weeks to review all the required
materials from the recent GPAC meeting on the LDAR Rule, can PHMSA
please explain this decision? Is PHMSA concerned about the potential of
substantive errors with the final rule since it appears the comment
process was being rushed and the rulemaking expedited? If PHMSA is not
concerned, what is the basis?
Answer. PHMSA provided the public a 90-day comment period after
publication of the Leak Detection and Repair NPRM. The public was
provided nearly 150 additional days to comment following the GPAC
meeting in November of 2023, where the most difficult issues relative
to the NPRM were addressed. PHMSA believes the 30 days provided for the
public to comment on the March 2024 GPAC meeting was ample time to
comment on the issues discussed at that meeting.
Additionally, PHMSA received comments from the public opposing the
extension of the comment period for GPAC proceedings pertaining to the
Leak Detection and Repair NPRM. Noting that the rule is urgently needed
to improve safety and reduce methane emissions across the millions of
miles of pipelines in the United States, and that the Protecting Our
Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 directed
PHMSA to finalize advanced leak detection and repair standards by
December 2021; commenters urged PHMSA to swiftly finalize the proposed
measures to improve public safety, arguing that extending the comment
period for GPAC proceedings pertaining to the Leak Detection and Repair
NPRM could further delay PHMSA's finalization of that rule.

Question 3.d. Deputy Administrator Brown stated that PHMSA has been
working with EPA to harmonize the LDAR rule from the proposal stage to
the final stage with new EPA methane regulations since there will be
overlapping requirements. Can PHMSA please share the dates of all
meetings between PHMSA and EPA, including the names of the EPA offices,
for each meeting? Please list other agencies and other stakeholders who
may have been included in these meetings as well.
Answer. PHMSA primarily met with representative from EPA's Office
of Air and Radiation. PHMSA also notes that this rulemaking is subject
to the interagency review process set forth in Executive Order 12866;
as part of that process, PHMSA provided briefings on the NPRM for
personnel from EPA and other agencies on the content of the rulemaking,
and responded to multiple rounds of comments on the draft rulemaking
package from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the
Office of Management and Budget, and diverse Executive Branch agencies
(including, but not limited to, EPA). Further opportunity for input
from EPA and other agencies will be provided as part of the Executive
Order 12866 review of the final rule.

Question 4. Representative Seth Moulton (D-MA) asked Deputy
Administrator Brown about PHMSA's perspective on integrity management
programs. Deputy Administrator Brown responded that integrity
management is working for some operators and not others. Additionally,
when asked if integrity management was the right approach, Deputy
Administrator Brown discussed other PHMSA programs without mentioning
the efficacy of the integrity management regulations.
Question 4.a, According to an industry review of PHMSA gas
transmission incident data in high consequence areas from 2010-2023,
there have been zero incidents due to external corrosion in 10 of 14
years, there have been zero incidents due to internal corrosion in 12
of 14 years, and there have been zero incidents due to stress corrosion
cracking in 12 of 14 years. These three threats are directly managed by
integrity management programs. Does PHMSA agree that these statistics
show that integrity management programs have made a positive impact on
safety in high consequence areas?
Answer. PHMSA is not familiar with analysis of incidents the
question refers to and is unable to provide comment on the analysis
without seeing it. In general, integrity management programs are
comprised of many individual measures and responses. Over the past
decade, the mileage of integrity assessments has increased, and we have
observed a decrease in all types of corrosion incidents across both gas
transmission and hazardous liquid pipelines for high consequence areas
(HCAs) and non-HCAs. Additionally, during the same period, there has
been a steady reduction in the number of repaired leaks and known leaks
scheduled for repair in gas transmission pipeline across all areas and
zones. It is encouraging to see the positive trends, but we remain
vigilant in our focus on how to improve integrity management.

Question 4.b. Given the statistics above, does the agency support
the expansion of integrity management principles on the nation's
pipeline systems beyond high consequence areas and moderate consequence
areas?
Answer. PHMSA supports consideration of initiatives that improve
pipeline safety, including consideration of the expansion of integrity
management principles beyond currently covered pipelines. It should be
noted that the Pipeline Safety Laws establish the minimum federal
pipeline safety regulations, operators are able to expand integrity
management principles to pipelines outside of their identified HCAs as
part of their safety programs without approval from PHMSA, and some
currently do so.

Question 4.c. Does the agency have measures or metrics, other than
incident reports or enforcement actions that it uses to track and
evaluate safety performance?
Answer. PHMSA uses a variety of measures to evaluate the safety
performance of operators. Incident rates (e.g., number of incidents per
1,000 miles) and enforcement actions are important measures, but PHMSA
has many others. Leaks and repair rates are used to track operator
issues that do not rise to the level of reportable incidents. PHMSA
also tracks miles of pipe composed of higher risk materials such as
cast iron, wrought iron and bare steel that merit additional scrutiny.
In addition, PHMSA evaluates operators' implementation of integrity
management, including the types and miles of in-line inspection tool
runs conducted each year and the results of those tool runs.
Serious incidents, onshore significant incidents in HCAs, and
additional metrics normalized per miles assessed by operator are also
analyzed and shared publicly on the PHMSA National Pipeline Performance
Measures page available to the general public here: https://
www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/national-pipeline-
performance-measures. Based on input from stakeholders, including
industry and public advocacy groups, PHMSA is considering revisiting
these measures and potentially adding others.
Besides these standard measures, PHMSA inspectors consider
information specific to overall company performance as well as
individual pipeline segments when preparing and conducting inspections.
This information varies based on the specific segment, but can include
factors such as special permits, river crossings, natural force
threats, time since last inspection, any operational changes, and
attached components.

Question 5. Recently, PHMSA informed the Government Accountability
Office (GAO) that the agency is considering regulatory changes to
improve the accuracy of its potential impact radius (PIR) formula.
Question 5.a. Why is PHMSA considering an update to the PIR, which
remains a highly effective tool to prioritize risk and ensure the
safety of our nation's natural gas pipeline system, as reported by GAO
earlier this month?
Question 5.b. The agency held a public meeting on the PIR in
December 2022 where PHMSA and the developer of the methodology (CFER)
reaffirmed its efficacy and application. The PIR was developed to
systematically define reasons to apply integrity management. It was not
intended to be a model for accurately determining the extent of damage
from a rupture. Can PHMSA please share why after the December 2022
meeting the agency is considering a shift in its belief that the
current PIR is an effective tool in prioritizing work to manage safety
threats?
Question 5.c. Can you please share the data, research, or analysis
that supports a change in the PIR?
Answer to 5.a., 5.b., & 5.c. On August 15, 2022, the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued Safety Recommendation P-22-1
to PHMSA. NTSB recommended that PHMSA ``Revise the calculation
methodology used in your regulations to determine the potential impact
radius of a pipeline rupture based on the accident data and human
response data discussed in this report.'' In response to NTSB's
recommendation, PHMSA conducted a public meeting December 13-15, 2022,
in Houston, Texas. There were two presentations that touched on and
provided information related to potential impact radius (PIR): one
related to the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB)
recommendation for PHMSA to consider a revision to the calculation
methodology used in the pipeline safety regulations to determine PIR
(see NTSB Safety Recommendation P-22-001); and the second was
information on the background for development and validation of the
PIR.
Following the public meeting PHMSA established a team to review the
current potential impact radius (PIR) calculation methodology, the
available accident data, and the human response data to determine if
revisions to the pipeline safety regulations are required. PHMSA has
completed its review of data and is in the process of discussing
options regarding methodology to respond to the NTSB's recommendation.
If a rulemaking initiative is established, all data reviewed by PHMSA's
team will be included in the docket.

Question 6. In prior presidential election years, DOT, including
PHMSA, has barred major rulemaking activity and grant awards from being
released several months prior to a presidential election.
Question 6.a. Will DOT and PHMSA be under a similar prohibition
this year?
Answer. PHMSA is not aware of any historical prohibitions along the
lines of those suggested. Rather, in advance of the most recent
presidential election, PHMSA issued a final rule on LNG by Rail
(RIN2137-AF40) in late July 2020, and a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
on Class Location (RIN2137-AF29) in October 2020. Similarly, before the
2016 presidential election, PHMSA issued each of the following
rulemaking actions: a final rule on FAST Act Requirements for Flammable
Liquids and Rail Tank Cars (RIN2137-AF17) in August 2016; a final rule
on Expanding the Use of Excess Flow Valves in Gas Distribution Systems
to Applications Other Than Single-Family Residences (RIN2137-AE71) in
October 2016; and an Interim Final Rule on Enhanced Emergency Orders
for Pipelines (RIN2137-AF26) in October 2016.

Question 6.b. If so, what dates will DOT and PHMSA bar major
rulemaking activity and grant funding from being released?
Answer. PHMSA is not aware of any prohibitions for either
rulemaking activity or grant funding in the nature described.

Question 7. Concerns have been raised about instances of certain
PHMSA inspectors, in several regional offices, acting in an
unprofessional manner during audits and inspections.
Question 7.a. Can the agency please provide details on what
trainings and/or programs PHMSA institutes to ensure its inspectors are
acting professionally and abiding by the Department of Transportation's
Standards of Ethical Conduct? Are any of these programs recurrent?
Answer. PHMSA's Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) takes the conduct
of our staff very seriously. We encourage all operators to bring issues
to the Region Directors and PHMSA/OPS leadership. Every year OPS
leadership conducts a planning meeting with the Region Directors and
Operations Supervisors. In the most recent two planning meetings we
have invited representatives from the regulated community and other
public interest stakeholders to come in and speak freely about their
observations on topics ranging from regulatory oversight and newly
issued regulations to inspection conduct. The attendees have not raised
the topic of federal inspector conduct as a concern in these meetings.
Additionally, several operators meet with PHMSA and OPS leadership
throughout the year, usually at their request. If a conduct issue were
to be raised, it would be investigated thoroughly.
With regard to training, every new inspector goes through an
``orientation'' with their supervisor. During this time the new
inspector is introduced to the various programs and policies at OPS.
The supervisor and new inspector discuss the various program objectives
and expectations. One policy in particular is the ``Conducting
Inspection Policy.'' Within this policy is section 3.2.2 ``Practical
and Behavioral Guidance for OPS Inspectors'' which describes OPS's
expectations for inspector conduct and behavior. PHMSA provides an
ethics orientation to every new employee during onboarding that reviews
the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch.
Additionally, PHMSA also provides ethics training annually for all its
employees.
Additionally, our inspectors are trained on performing an
inspection exit briefing with operator personnel. Our inspectors are
required to identify potential noncompliances to personnel who may face
company chastisement for failing to ensure the company meets minimum
safety requirements. These exit briefings are constructive, and
inspectors are trained to identify the issues as potential, not final
findings. Potential findings are discussed with Operations Supervisors
and Region Directors. Region Directors make the final determination of
whether an enforcement case will be initiated.
Continuing on with the new inspector's training and development,
all inspectors attend several formal classroom training classes at
OPS's Training and Qualification center in Oklahoma City, OK. In their
initial class PL1250 Introduction to Pipeline Safety Inspections, there
is a block of instruction ``Standards of Ethical Conduct'' which
discusses conducting inspections in a professional manner and about
their interactions with operators.
Finally, OPS is continuing to improve its programs and
communication. Underway in 2024 is the updating and improvement of
OPS's On-the-job Training (OJT) policy. Within this update we are
emphasizing the introduction or orientation of new inspectors to better
ensure the culture of OPS is introduced to new staff from the beginning
of their career with OPS. Continuing with the inspectors' OJT, all
inspectors are evaluated as they progress through OJT. Their supervisor
will accompany them on inspections to observe their performance. A
specific portion of that evaluation is the behavior and conduct of the
inspector.

Question 7.b. If none have been created, can PHMSA commit to
holding nationwide training for its inspection personnel in 2024?
Furthermore, can PHMSA establish a frequency with which inspectors must
be re-trained?
Answer. OPS believes it has adequate policies and programs to
address the conduct and behavior of its inspection staff and conducts
ongoing training for its inspection staff on various topics including
required annual PHMSA ethics training. OPS leadership holds regular
meetings with inspection staff throughout the year, and this topic is
one that will be raised to continue to impress on staff the importance
of ethical and professional behavior.

Question 7.c. How does PHMSA address reports from operators that
inspectors have acted unprofessionally and/or violated the DOT's
Standards of Ethical Conduct? What measures does PHMSA have in place to
ensure that no retaliation occurs against an operator for making such a
report?
Answer. PHMSA encourages operators to contact PHMSA management with
any concerns about the performance or conduct of its inspectors; PHMSA
cannot act to correct behavior it is not informed of. While conduct
complaints are rare, allegations are taken seriously and thoroughly
investigated. If possible and appropriate, PHMSA will maintain the
anonymity of the complainant. All reports related to misconduct are
immediately elevated throughout the PHMSA management chain for
appropriate follow-up action.

Question 7.d. Concerns have also been raised about instances where
PHMSA audits can take months to complete when they are scheduled to be
completed in one week. Can PHMSA please explain why this occurs?
Answer. Pipeline inspections are rarely, if ever, scheduled to be
completed in one week. A routine inspection will include a 1-2 day
virtual scoping meeting with the operator, followed by a week or two of
preparation as inspectors review operator incident data and compliance
histories. This is generally followed by several days (or weeks
depending on the size of the system) reviewing company procedures,
maintenance manuals and records, and when appropriate, some of the
procedural and record review are performed virtually. Some companies
operate only a few hundred miles of pipeline and others many thousands
of miles. A typical pipeline inspection includes evaluation of hundreds
of pipeline miles and associated facilities, hundreds of pages of
procedures and multiple years of records. PHMSA physically inspects the
system's compressor or pump stations, overpressure protection devices,
manifolds, breakout tanks, as well as drive hundreds of miles verifying
adequate cathodic protection (corrosion prevention) readings and right-
of-way maintenance. Inspecting this quantity of facilities and
materials generally occur over many weeks. In consideration of the
impact to company staff, PHMSA will often spread the inspection weeks
out over multiple months. For example, PHMSA may schedule a one-week
inspection along an operator's right-of-way and then return a month
later for a one-week examination of the operator's records at its
office. Additionally, if an inspector identifies safety concerns, they
may request additional information to better understand the
circumstances. If this occurs, a scheduled inspection timeframe may be
extended.

Question 7.e. What can PHMSA do differently to ensure that audits
are completed efficiently going forward?
Answer. PHMSA crafts each inspection to focus on the known risks of
the pipeline based on the company and pipeline history--as well as
other risk-based factors. This means that all other things being equal,
pipeline companies with better safety and compliance histories, as well
as those that are situated in lower risk areas (e.g., not near schools,
population centers) will experience relatively fewer inspections topics
and a potentially shorter inspection time. During each of the last two
years, PHMSA has invited stakeholders to its annual inspection planning
meeting and asked they provide insight into what PHMSA is doing well in
its inspection program and what can be improved. In 2024, PHMSA will
again seek input from the regulated industry on ways to improve our
efficiency and effectiveness.
As resources are available, PHMSA will explore opportunities to
leverage machine learning to enhance our ability to focus inspection
resources on the riskiest aspects of pipeline systems and perhaps
lessen time spent evaluating less risky aspects. However, our number
one priority continues to be the safe operation of the nation's 3.3
million miles of regulated pipelines that we oversee.

Question 7.f. Ensuring consistent auditing and understanding of the
code is important to avoid ambiguity, misinterpretation, and confusion
during PHMSA audits. How is the agency working to ensure that PHMSA
inspectors are objectively and consistently auditing to the code
language as opposed to incorporating their opinions or interpretations
of the code?
Answer. As noted previously, PHMSA requires all federal and state
inspectors to undergo rigorous training, provides continuous
opportunities for various training, and is enhancing its OJT program to
help ensure national consistency. PHMSA also provides its inspectors
training and enforcement guidance, as well as access to agency
decisions, interpretations, and consensus standards--many of these
resources are also made publicly available by PHMSA.
Inspectors are not authorized to independently determine non-
compliance and all proposed enforcement actions are reviewed by at
least one supervisor and a region attorney prior to issuance. As
mentioned, Region Directors make the final determination of whether an
enforcement case will be initiated. This ensures that the enforcement
action is not based on inaccurate or inconsistent interpretations of
the pipeline safety regulations.
If a company disagrees with an enforcement action, it has a
multitude of response options, including requesting a hearing,
settlement discussions, and petitioning for reconsideration of any
final order. Ultimately, a challenge to a final PHMSA determination may
be brought in federal court. PHMSA works to be clear and effective in
its oversight and companies have many opportunities to contest PHMSA
citations in both informal and formal settings.

Question 8. Representative Dusty Johnson (R-SD) asked Deputy
Administrator Brown about PHMSA's technology pilot program and why the
agency has not made modifications to it since, to date, no industry
members have applied. In Deputy Administrator Brown's testimony, he
stated that PHMSA sought feedback from stakeholders prior to the
program being finalized, as well as after it was determined the program
needed modifications.
Question 8.a. In testimony to the Committee on May 7, 2024, Deputy
Administrator Brown stated PHMSA gathered public comment on the
Pipeline Safety Enhancement Program (PSEP) before it issued program
guidance. On what date(s) prior to February 2, 2022, did PHMSA request
public input on the PSEP and how did it make this request?
Question 8.b. On February 2, 2022, PHMSA issued a Notice (87 Fed
Reg 5939) outlining how PHMSA would review and process PSEP requests.
The Notice makes no mention of PHMSA gathering public comments or
description of how PHMSA incorporated public comments into the Notice.
How did PHMSA reflect in the February 2, 2022 Notice any public
comments it may have gathered?
Question 8.c. In testimony to the Committee on May 7, 2024, Deputy
Administrator Brown stated PHMSA gathered feedback from stakeholders
after the Committee's 2023 hearing and questioning on this topic. On
what dates did PHMSA meet with stakeholders to discuss PSEP
improvements? With which groups did PHMSA meet?
Question 8.d. What actions has PHMSA taken to make changes to its
PSEP request review process to improve program participation?
Answer to 8.a., 8.b., 8.c., & 8.d. 49 U.S.C. 60142 authorized PHMSA
to allow innovative technologies and operational practices that may
provide more robust protection of public safety and the environment
than the existing Federal pipeline safety regulations. PHMSA issued
program guidance on February 2, 2022, and on February 9, 2022, met with
representatives of the industry (i.e., Association of Oil Pipelines) to
discuss possible improvements to the PSEP process. During the hearing
it was mentioned that PHMSA did not receive any public comment
regarding the PESP process.
Prior to the issuance of a Federal Register notice (Notice)
regarding the establishment of the PSEP (87 FR 5939), PHMSA held
virtual gas and liquid pipeline advisory committee meetings, and the
industry submitted comments to the docket for PHMSA's consideration in
the development of the PSEP guidance materials. Following the issuance
of the Notice, PHMSA met with industry representatives to discuss
potential candidates for participation; however, none of the projects
moved forward.

Questions to Christina Sames, Senior Vice President, Safety,
Operations, Engineering, and Security, American Gas Association, from
Hon. Troy E. Nehls

Question 1. The PIPES Act of 2023 includes authorization of a
voluntary information sharing system (VIS) at PHMSA. I understand the
American Gas Association (AGA) has its own internal confidential
reporting system.
Question 1.a. What are the benefits of PHMSA establishing such a
program compared to AGA's internal system or separate system created by
industry?
Answer. AGA's voluntary information sharing program only collects
data from AGA members and is only available to AGA's members. If PHMSA
is authorized to create a VIS, it (or a designated organization) could
collect information from all of its regulated pipeline operators, as
well as others willing to share pipeline safety data and lessons
learned from events. It could also collect information broader in scope
than that currently collected by AGA, such as pipeline integrity threat
and risk analysis information. This would provide a more wholistic view
of pipeline safety challenges, remediation measures, and lessons
learned from incidents, near misses, and other events.
Standing up a VIS under PHMSA's purview could also leverage the
data entry interface that the agency already uses for incidents and
other mandatory reporting. A familiar user interface could help drive
data consistency and encourage participation from operators.

Question 1.b. From your perspective, how much participation would a
VIS system see from pipeline operators?
Answer. I believe that it will depend on how the VIS is set up and
managed. I believe that operators will voluntarily submit data to the
VIS only if the VIS is created with the proper legal protections and
assurances of confidentiality, if PHMSA is clear on how it will collect
the data and protect the confidentiality of those submitting the data,
if PHMSA and state regulators make it clear that data submitted to the
VIS cannot be used as evidence for enforcement or litigation (unless
there is evidence of a criminal violation), and if PHMSA is clear on
how it will utilize the data to work with others to improve pipeline
safety. If any element is missing, I believe that operators will be
hesitant to submit information. AGA believes there may be value in
contemplating an independent organization to collect this information
on behalf of the industry.

Question 1.c. What pipeline safety outcomes do you envision once a
VIS system is established and operational?
Answer. The VIS provisions in the T&I bill are similar to voluntary
information collection systems AGA has established. As an example, one
of the voluntary collection systems AGA manages is the Plastic Pipe
Database. The database contains approximately 150,000 reports on
plastic pipe failures and the data is analyzed several times each year
by a group of representatives from government (PHMSA, the NTSB, state
regulators and commissioners) and industry (natural gas operators and
manufacturers). After each meeting, the committee publishes a status
report of its analysis. These status reports have been used by--

Natural gas distribution operators when they are revising
their distribution integrity management programs, determining if
changes need to be made to pipeline replacement practices or risk
models, and for safety updates to employees and field crews

Manufacturers to determine if changes need to be made to
their installation instructions

Contractors to help identify materials they encounter
when conducting pipe repair and replacement

Government when analyzing data from incidents, conducting
audits, or issuing advisories

I envision that the VIS reports will be used in a similar fashion,
highlighting potential trends or findings that enable industry
stakeholders to make more informed decisions that can lead to improved
pipeline safety.

Questions to Christina Sames, Senior Vice President, Safety,
Operations, Engineering, and Security, American Gas Association, from
Hon. Frederica S. Wilson

Question 1. For the record, could you state what has been the
leading cause of serious, significant, and all pipeline incidents over
the last 20 years, and the last 3 years? Where do excavation damage
incidents rank among leading causes?
Answer. Over the last 20 years, based on PHMSA data \1\ analyzed 5/

Questions to Robin Rorick, Vice President of Midstream Policy, American
Petroleum Institute, from Hon. Troy E. Nehls

Question 1. The PIPES Act of 2023 includes authorization of a
voluntary information sharing system (VIS) at PHMSA.
Question 1.a. What are the benefits of PHMSA establishing such a
program compared to a system created by industry?
Answer. A government run Voluntary Information Sharing (VIS)
program is a proven model that has had success at the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) and shown positive results in safety performance
for the aviation industry. This committee has wisely chosen to take a
similar approach. The VIS program is intended to be a new paradigm for
analyzing pipeline safety data that is separate and apart from, but
complementary and additive to, existing PHMSA pipeline safety programs,
which is why it is important that PHMSA play a leadership role. PHMSA
has an Accident Investigation Division (AID) that is well positioned to
lead this effort and build on the current programs and initiatives
being implemented at AID.
Like the program established for the airline industry, a federal
agency-led initiative will provide a vehicle for operators to safely
and securely submit any related safety information. This information
can then be aggregated and redistributed back out to the industry for
consideration and, where appropriate, action.

Question 1.b. From your perspective, how much participation would a
VIS system see from pipeline operators?
Answer. If designed properly to ensure the information is protected
and not used punitively, as is the case with your bill, API believes
that its member companies that operate pipeline systems are likely to
participate in the program. However, participation would be more likely
if there is a robust process for data transfer and management and
appropriate confidentiality protection is provided for all information
submitted to the VIS. Without such assurance and incentives, operators
would be concerned that the information could be used punitively, and
therefore operators would be less inclined to voluntarily share
information. Using the information punitively would inhibit the shared
objectives of industry, government and public advocacy groups to
advance safety and reach our goal of zero pipeline incidents.
The model established for the aviation industry, which this
language reflects, provides appropriate levels of information
protection and has seen great success with regard to information and
data submittal.

Question 1.c. What pipeline safety outcomes do you envision once a
VIS system is established and operational?
Answer. As an industry, we are constantly working to improve our
safety record. Having access to as much information and data as
possible helps ensure that the industry can take appropriate action to
accurately target potential threats or risks of incident.
The VIS program's collaborative approach to collecting and
analyzing safety-related information has the potential to further
enhance safety through timely and meaningful sharing of trends and
potential risks across our industry, while enhancing safety management
systems and strengthening safety culture.
Ultimately, proactively reducing and eliminating pipeline releases
will minimize personal injuries and damage to the environment while
ensuring that the industry can continue to deliver the benefits of
affordable and reliable energy to the public.

Questions to Bill Caram, Executive Director, Pipeline Safety Trust,
from Hon. Troy E. Nehls

Question 1. Does the Pipeline Safety Trust support this Committee's
bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the pipeline safety programs at
PHMSA?
Answer. The Pipeline Safety Trust appreciates the bipartisan spirit
in creating this legislation and does not oppose the bill. But because
we still have a long way to go to eliminate the hazards from our
nation's pipelines, we hope the Senate can produce legislation that
includes more of our priorities that will lead to more progress on
pipeline safety. We are a long way from our shared goal of zero
incidents, and much more must be done to make meaningful progress.
Strong legislation is a powerful and resilient path towards that goal.

Question 2. Does the Pipeline Safety Trust support the creation of
a voluntary information sharing system (VIS) at PHMSA?
Answer. The Pipeline Safety Trust does not oppose the creation of a
voluntary information sharing (VIS) system, though we do have concerns
with the makeup of the governing board as outlined in the legislation.
Specifically, we have concerns with ``public safety-focused research
institutions'' being included in the public caucus rather than the
industry caucus.

Question to Bill Caram, Executive Director, Pipeline Safety Trust, from
Hon. Frederica S. Wilson

Question 1. Integrity management programs are the primary tool that
pipeline operators use to ensure the safety of their pipelines. For the
record, is integrity management working as intended?
Answer. The Pipeline Safety Trust does not believe the Integrity
Management (IM) program is working as intended. IM asks operators to
identify all potential threats in High Consequence Areas (HCAs) and
create and implement a plan to mitigate against those threats.
Regulations do not require operators to perform IM on pipelines outside
of HCAs. We would expect, after about 20 years of IM, to see lower
incident rates within HCAs versus outside HCAs if the program was
working effectively. However, we generally see the exact opposite.
PHMSA itself has pointed out problems with IM regulations. The NTSB
has detailed the issues. A recent NAS report on rupture mitigation
valves detailed problems with IM. We don't believe the program needs to
be thrown out, but stakeholders need to figure out what is and isn't
working, create an improvement plan, and implement that plan.
