Director of Passenger Operations at CSX; Stacey Mortensen,
Executive Director of The San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission;
Lee Ohanian, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution; and Mayor
Kirk Watson of Austin, Texas. The witnesses will discuss issues
and opportunities for United States intercity passenger rail,
including opportunities for private sector competition, working
with freight railroads to improve service, and how best to
approach building new intercity passenger rail corridors,
including high-speed rail.

II. FEDERAL FUNDING FOR INTERCITY PASSENGER RAIL

Congress authorizes and appropriates funding for Federal
discretionary grant programs to support intercity passenger
rail service, some of which are described below.

CONSOLIDATED RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS (CRISI) GRANT
PROGRAM

The Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety
Improvements (CRISI) grant program was initially authorized in
the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act in 2015
(P.L. 114-94) and reauthorized in the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act (IIJA) (P.L. 117-58) in 2021.\1\ CRISI's purpose
is to provide funding for freight and intercity rail projects
including those that ``improve railroad safety, efficiency, and
reliability; mitigate congestion at both intercity passenger
and freight rail chokepoints to support more efficient travel
and goods movement . . . and lead to new or substantially
improved Intercity Passenger Rail Transportation corridors.''
\2\ Eligible applicants include states (and the District of
Columbia), Federally-recognized Indian tribes, public agencies,
Amtrak or other rail carriers providing intercity passenger
rail transportation, and Class II and Class III freight
railroads.\3\ The Federal cost share of a CRISI grant award
cannot exceed 80 percent of the project cost, with the
remaining funding comprising state/local government or private
sector funding.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The IIJA funded CRISI at $5 billion over five years and
subsequent annual appropriations bills have also included
funding for this program.\4\ In September 2023, the Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA) announced fiscal year (FY) 2022
CRISI awards totaling over $1.4 billion for 70 projects, 10 of
which fund intercity passenger rail projects.\5\

FEDERAL-STATE PARTNERSHIP FOR INTERCITY PASSENGER RAIL GRANT PROGRAM

Sections 22106 and 22307 of IIJA authorize the Federal-
State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail (FSP) Grant
Program.\6\ This grant program was created specifically for
intercity passenger rail and provides funding for capital
projects that reduce the state of good repair backlog, improve
service performance and improve existing or establish new
intercity passenger rail service, including privately operated
passenger rail service.\7\ Eligible projects include projects
to replace, rehabilitate, or repair infrastructure, equipment,
or facilities used for providing intercity passenger rail
service to bring assets into a state of good repair or to
improve intercity passenger rail service performance; expand or
establish new intercity passenger rail service; or for the
planning, environmental review, and final design of an eligible
project or group of projects.\8\ Eligible recipients include:
an individual or group of states, including the District of
Columbia, an Interstate Compact, a public agency or publicly
chartered authority established by one or more states, a
political subdivision of a state, Amtrak, a Federally
recognized Indian Tribe or any combination of these
entities.\9\

Because the IIJA designated the majority of the advance
appropriated funds for FSP for the Northeast Corridor and set
out specific requirements for funding projects in this region,
the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) issued two separate
notices of funding opportunity (NOFO) to break out the
Northeast Corridor funding from National Network funding.\10\
The FY 2023 FSP NOFO amounts for the Northeast Corridor and
National network intercity passenger rail projects was $9
billion and $4.566 billion, respectively.\11\ On November 6,
2023, FRA announced awards of roughly $16.4 billion for the
Northeast Corridor, including $7.4 billion in phased funding
agreements authorized and advance appropriated in the IIJA.\12\
FRA expects to issue the FSP-National awards by the end of this
year.\13\ While the NEC funding is open to entities besides
Amtrak, the majority of the Northeast Corridor is owned by
Amtrak and 12 of the 25 selections were awarded to Amtrak.\14\
Some states, freight railroads and commuter rail systems also
receive benefits in conjunction with Amtrak.\15\

RESTORATION AND ENHANCEMENT GRANTS

The Restoration and Enhancement Grant program was
authorized in Section 11303 of the FAST Act.\16\ IIJA
authorized $50 million over five years for the program, which
provides operating assistance grants to initiate, restore, or
enhance intercity rail passenger transportation for up to six
corridors.\17\ Eligible entities include states or their
political subdivisions, groups of states, interstate compacts,
public agencies or publicly chartered authorities established
by one or more states, Amtrak or other intercity passenger rail
carriers, rail carriers in partnership with any eligible
government entities, or a combination.\18\ For FY 2018 through
FY 2020, the Restoration and Enhancement grant program awarded

III. ILLUSTRATIVE CORRIDOR DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS

CSX AND PASSENGER RAIL

In December 2019, Virginia and CSX freight railroad reached
an agreement to improve passenger and freight rail service in
the Commonwealth.\20\ The agreement represents a $3.7 billion
investment by Virginia and Amtrak in CSX that includes building
a new bridge across the Potomac River with track for exclusive
passenger rail use, acquiring over 380 miles of railroad right-
of-way and over 200 miles of track, and making 37 miles of
track improvements for passenger service.\21\ Per the
agreement, over ten years, Virginia Amtrak trains would double;
Amtrak service between Washington, D.C. and Richmond would
double; and Virginia Railway Express (VRE) service would
increase by 75 percent in some areas.\22\ The agreement,
finalized in March 2021, benefits CSX, Amtrak, VRE, and
Virginia, and will increase capacity for freight and passenger
rail.\23\

CALIFORNIA_SAN JOAQUIN CORRIDOR

The California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA) is the
Nation's largest state transportation agency responsible for
maritime, highway, transit, and rail systems planning,
investment, and oversight.\25\ California has three long-
standing intercity passenger rail corridors currently led by
joint powers authorities serving markets in the San Diego-Los
Angeles area, San Joaquin Valley to Bakersfield, and Oakland to
Sacramento.\26\

CALIFORNIA HIGH-SPEED RAIL PROJECT

The proposed California High Speed Rail (CAHSR) project
began in 2008 when California voters approved a bond issue to
construct high speed passenger rail service between the cities
of Los Angeles and San Francisco.\34\ At the time, the project
was estimated to cost $33 billion and was to be completed in
2020.\35\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding costs, the Congressional Research Service (CRS)
notes that ``few, if any, high-speed rail lines anywhere in the
world have earned enough revenue to cover both their
construction and operating costs, even where population density
is far greater than anywhere in the United States.'' \36\ Much
like the Federal investments made by the United States
Government in highways, aviation, and transit, foreign
governments have generally contributed to the cost of
construction and in many cases the operating costs of high-
speed rail as well.\37\

TEXAS TRIANGLE

The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) submitted
proposals to the FRA's Corridor ID Program in the Spring of
2023 to link the Texas Triangle of Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston,
and San Antonio metropolitan areas with short-distance
intercity passenger trains.\40\ The Dallas-Fort Worth-Houston
Corridor would connect the two biggest metropolitan areas in
Texas, and the Houston-Dallas-Fort Worth-San Antonio region
contains more than 18 million people and 77 percent of the
state's economic output.\41\ The San Antonio-Dallas-Fort Worth
route would also connect with the state capitol in Austin and
six of the eight largest cities in the Texas Triangle.\42\ The
Texas Triangle has been identified as part of the Amtrak

GETTING ON THE RIGHT TRACK: NAVIGATING THE FUTURE OF INTERCITY
PASSENGER RAIL IN AMERICA

----------

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 2023

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous
Materials,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 11 a.m., in room
2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Troy E. Nehls
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Nehls. The Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and
Hazardous Materials will come to order.
I ask unanimous consent that the chairman be authorized to
declare a recess at any time during today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the Members not on the
subcommittee be permitted to sit with the subcommittee at
today's hearing and ask questions.
Without objection, so ordered.
As a reminder, if Members wish to insert a document into
the record, please also email it to
[email protected]
.
I now recognize myself for the purpose of an opening
statement for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TROY E. NEHLS OF TEXAS, CHAIRMAN,
SUBCOMMITTEE ON RAILROADS, PIPELINES, AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Mr. Nehls. Today's hearing will discuss the state of
intercity passenger rail with a focus on how to develop this
mode in a way that is safe, efficient, cost effective, and that
meets the demands of consumers. Investments and innovation in
our rail infrastructure are essential to building a robust and
competitive American transportation system. We must ensure that
Federal policies and spending are balanced with a realistic
analysis of consumer demand for passenger rail and best use of
taxpayers' dollars.
There is no better example, not a better example of
completely ignoring these important considerations, than the
high-speed California rail project originally proposed to run
between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The venture, once
estimated to cost $33 billion and to be completed in 2020, is
now projected to cost over $128 billion and counting, with an
estimated completion date still over a decade away with no
solid path forward.
The project has been plagued by a failure to account for
actual costs and work associated with obtaining the land to
build the track, eminent domain issues, environmental concerns,
permitting redtape, and whether low consumer demand will
require permanent and costly Government subsidies to operate
the line.
While the California high-speed rail project shows the
failures of poor planning and Government incompetence, there
are promising opportunities to promote intercity passenger rail
responsibly. Encouraging competition, removing these burdensome
Government obstacles, focusing on areas of high demand, and
involving the private sector have proven effective ways of
managing intercity passenger rail, and today, we will hear from
witnesses about those promising efforts.
I look forward to discussing both the challenges and the
opportunities for intercity passenger rail, as well as how
Congress can provide robust oversight and safeguard taxpayer
dollars that support these projects.
I would like to thank all of our witnesses. Thank you all
for being here today.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Troy E. Nehls, a Representative in Congress
from the State of Texas, and Chairman, Subcommittee on Railroads,
Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials
Today's hearing will discuss the state of intercity passenger rail
with a focus on how to develop this mode in a way that is safe,
efficient, cost effective, and that meets the demands of consumers.
Investments and innovation in our rail infrastructure are essential
to building a robust and competitive American transportation system.
We must ensure that federal policies and spending are balanced with
a realistic analysis of consumer demand for passenger rail and best use
of taxpayer dollars.
There is no better example of completely ignoring these important
considerations than the disastrous California High-Speed Rail project
originally proposed to run between Los Angeles and San Francisco.
The venture, once estimated to cost $33 billion and be completed in
2020, is now projected to cost over $128 billion and counting, with an
estimated completion date still over a decade away and no solid path
forward.
The project has been plagued by a failure to account for actual
costs and work associated with obtaining land to build the track,
eminent domain issues, environmental concerns, permitting red tape, and
whether low consumer demand will require permanent and costly
government subsidies to operate the line.
While the California High-Speed Rail project shows the failures of
poor planning and government incompetence, there are promising
opportunities to promote intercity passenger rail responsibly.
Encouraging competition, removing burdensome government obstacles,
focusing on areas of high demand, and involving the private sector have
proven effective ways of managing intercity passenger rail, and today
we will hear from witnesses about those promising efforts.
I look forward to discussing both the challenges and the
opportunities for intercity passenger rail, as well as how Congress can
provide robust oversight and safeguard taxpayer dollars that support
these projects.
Thank you to all our witnesses for being here today.

Mr. Nehls. I will yield back the balance of my time, and I
will now recognize our Ranking Member Payne for 5 minutes for
an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, Jr., OF NEW JERSEY,
RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON RAILROADS, PIPELINES, AND
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Mr. Payne. Good morning, and thank you, Chairman Nehls,
Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, and our four witnesses
for being with us today.
Intercity passenger rail is on the brink of transformation,
thanks to the $100 billion in funding for rail projects in the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Over $4.6 billion is soon to be
awarded across the Nation through FRA programs, including the
Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Grants
and the eagerly awaited Corridor ID Program, with 92 proposals
from 33 States under consideration. Announcements for awards
are expected by yearend.
Earlier this month, the FRA awarded over $16 billion in
funding for projects along the Northeast Corridor, including
funding for the Gateway Program. Almost $4.5 billion of that
funding would directly impact my constituents in New Jersey's
10th Congressional District. This influx of funding for
intercity passenger rail projects would not be possible without
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which was passed by this
Chamber and signed into law by President Biden this month 2
years ago. This funding is already enabling Amtrak and local
governments to focus on sustainable, long-term projects rather
than short-term patches.
While project funding is crucial, it's equally vital to
secure operational and network maintenance funding. It was
unfortunate to see a majority of my colleagues across the aisle
either vote to cut funding to rail programs by 57 percent, or
completely axe funding for Amtrak's national network as we
considered the fiscal year 2024 Transportation, Housing and
Urban Development appropriations bill earlier this month.
The bill was already flawed, with a 64-percent cut in
funding to Amtrak, including a 35-percent cut to the national
network and a staggering 92-percent--92-percent--cut to the
Northeast Corridor. If these funding levels were adopted,
Amtrak would likely significantly cut service across the
national network, disconnecting passengers in both rural and
urban communities who are reliant on Amtrak to go visit family,
travel for work, or attend an event in another city.
The bill also eradicates funding for crucial programs like
the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail
Grants, vital for capital improvements and establishing new
routes.
And if those cuts weren't enough, the bill also had a 50-
percent cut in funding to the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure
and Safety Improvements Program, which is used to fund safety
improvement projects for both intercity rail and freight rail
projects. Fortunately, these drastic cuts were too severe to
pass the House, allowing the Senate to pursue a more balanced
bill aligned with the success of the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law.
Mr. Chairman, while I am glad to see your interest in
intercity passenger rail, and I am thrilled that we have had
multiple hearings on this issue this Congress, I want to note
that today marks the 300th day since the Norfolk Southern
derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and this subcommittee has
yet to have a hearing on freight rail safety. We have had a
representative from the CSX freight railroad in this room to
talk about passenger rail, but not to talk about how a small
town in Kentucky was evacuated last week due to a CSX
derailment involving molten sulfur. Instead of being at home to
celebrate Thanksgiving with family, these families were forced
to spend part of their day in a middle school gymnasium.
There is a freight rail derailment practically every day in
this country, and every day we go without addressing this issue
here in Congress is another day communities across the country
are at risk for a preventable catastrophe.
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses how the $100
billion in funding for rail projects in the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law will benefit our Nation's communities.
And with that, I yield back.

TESTIMONY OF ANDY DALY, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF PASSENGER
OPERATIONS, CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC.; STACEY MORTENSEN,
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SAN JOAQUIN JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY; LEE E.
OHANIAN, Ph.D., DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, UCLA, AND
SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION, STANFORD UNIVERSITY; AND
HON. KIRK WATSON, MAYOR, CITY OF AUSTIN, TEXAS

TESTIMONY OF ANDY DALY, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF PASSENGER
OPERATIONS, CSX TRANSPORTATION, INC.

Mr. Daly. Yes, sir. Good morning, Chairman Nehls, Ranking
Member Payne, and members of the rail subcommittee. Thank you
for the opportunity to speak to you today.
I am Andy Daly, senior director of passenger operations at
CSX and a fourth-generation railroader. I have been with CSX
for 23 years. For the past 6 years, I have served as senior
director of passenger operations. As part of my duties, I serve
as the point person for all performance and contractual
relationships with our passenger operation partners across
CSX's 20,000-mile network.
Like other Class I railroads, CSX operates almost
exclusively on infrastructure we own, build, and maintain.
About $0.40 of every dollar earned in the railroad industry
goes back to the upkeep of our railroads, making us one of the
most capital intensive industries in the Nation. Despite this
challenge, the American Society of Civil Engineers gives rail
infrastructure the highest grade for our infrastructure
conditions as compared to all other U.S. transportation modes.
Over the last 5 years, CSX has invested $10 billion into our
network, with $2.3 billion in 2023 alone.
When working with Amtrak or other passenger rail operators,
CSX endeavors to create a safe, well-planned, cost effective,
and transparent partnership. CSX runs 5.5 million train-miles
on CSX per year, which is one-quarter of Amtrak's train-miles
in the United States. On average, 60 Amtrak trains operate on
our tracks daily. The volume of Amtrak trains, along with 159
trains operated by our commuter rail partners like VRE, MARC,
and MBTA, make CSX among the most passenger-intensive freight
railroads in the United States.
Thanks to the hard work of many at CSX, we achieved the
best contract on-time performance in our history of hosting
Amtrak in 2022. We closed out the year with 94.8 percent on-
time performance, which was a 2-percent improvement over the
prior year.
CSX looks at four pillars when discussing passenger rail
expansion or new opportunities.
Number one, safety. The addition of new passenger service
cannot impact the safety of our customers, employees, existing
passenger commuter service, or surrounding communities.
Number two, capacity. There must be adequate capacity to
meet our current and future customer needs.
Number three, compensation. CSX must be fairly compensated
for the use of our infrastructure, as well as maintenance
costs.
And four, liability. CSX cannot take on additional
liability when additional passenger services are brought onto
our network.
These four pillars are critical to the health of our
Nation's supply chain and the safety of our communities. CSX's
recent transaction with the Commonwealth of Virginia is an
example of how strong adherence to these pillars can pave the
way for introduction of enhanced passenger operations. The
series of construction projects included in the transaction are
currently underway between Washington and Richmond. This
project is a result of a tremendous amount of effort by
Virginia, CSX, and Amtrak, and will result in significant
expansion of VRE and Amtrak services while also preserving our
ability to meet current and future freight demand. Importantly,
it shows the demand for both freight and passenger rail service
can be respected and protected when the parties work together
in an open and honest format.
In 2021, CSX acquired Pan Am Railroad, operated through New
England. CSX is working with the Northern New England Passenger
Rail Authority on several projects that will improve both the
reliability and pave the way for an increase in Downeaster
service. We are also in ongoing planning with the Massachusetts
Department of Transportation and pursuing a thoughtful way to
expand passenger rail operations in the Commonwealth between
Boston and Springfield.
On behalf of our president and CEO Joe Hinrichs and those
of us in leadership at CSX, we want to emphasize with the
members of the committee that our company initiative, called
ONE CSX, prioritizes teamwork across all levels, all
departments, and all locations. The transformative shift in our
workplace culture is foundational to the way we work together;
operate as one team; and where employees feel valued, included,
appreciated, and are able to contribute to our business
objectives to safely and reliably serve our customers. We are
optimistic about our ability to partner with passenger rail
operators where it makes sense and where we can plan ahead.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.
[Mr. Daly's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Andy Daly, Senior Director of Passenger
Operations, CSX Transportation, Inc.
Good morning Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Payne, and Members of
the Rail Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you
today.
I am Andy Daly, Senior Director of Passenger Operations at CSX and
a fourth generation railroader. I have been with CSX for 23 years. I
hired on with the railroad straight out of college as a union employee
working in Lima, Ohio. From there I entered into a front line
management position as a Manager of Train Operations in Toledo, Ohio.
After four years in Toledo, I moved to Chicago as a Director of Train
Operations working in the dispatch center in Chicago. From there I went
back in to the Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as a Terminal
Manager overseeing operations in three different yards, as well as line
of road operations. After my time in Philadelphia, I returned to
Chicago to run the dispatch center as a Superintendent of Train
Operations, a position I held for seven years. This brings me to my
current role that I have held for six years as the Senior Director of
Passenger Operations. As part of my duties, I serve as the point person
on all performance and contractual relationships for all of our
passenger operations partners across CSX's 20,000 mile network.
CSX's rail network is an essential part of the nation's supply
chain, spanning over 20,000 route miles, connecting to 70 ports, and
serving nearly two-thirds of the population east of the Mississippi
River in 26 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian
provinces of Ontario and Quebec. With an annual payroll over $2
billion, CSX has over 22,500 employees (including subsidiaries) of
diverse backgrounds and skillsets. In 2022, CSX averaged moving one ton
of freight 537 miles on a single gallon of fuel, which is 3-4 times
more fuel-efficient than moving one ton of freight by truck.
Like other Class 1 railroads, CSX operates almost exclusively on
infrastructure we own, build, and maintain. About 40 cents of every
dollar earned in the railroad industry goes back into the upkeep of our
railroads, making us one of the most capital intensive industries in
the nation. Despite this challenge, the American Society of Civil
Engineers gives rail infrastructure the highest grade for our
infrastructure conditions as compared to all other transportation
modes. In 2023, CSX will have invested $2.3 billion, with $1.7 billion
going to CSX bridges, track and signals. Over the last 5 years, CSX has
invested almost $10 billion into its infrastructure.
When working with Amtrak or other passenger rail operators, CSX
endeavors to create a safe, well-planned, cost-effective, and
transparent partnership. On average, we host a quarter of Amtrak's
train miles in the United States. Amtrak runs 5.5 million train miles
on CSX per year. On average, 59 Amtrak trains operate on our tracks
daily. The volume of Amtrak trains, together with the 159 trains
operating on CSX by commuter rail providers like VRE, MARC, and MBTA,
makes us among the most passenger-intensive freight railroads in the
United States. Thanks to the hard work of many at CSX, in 2022, CSX
achieved its best Contract On-Time Performance in our history of
hosting Amtrak service. We closed out the year with 94.8% on-time
performance, which was a 2% improvement over the prior year.

Thanks to the hard work of many at CSX, we have good relations with
each of these passenger rail partners and their various operators. We
recognize Amtrak, at the direction of Congress, has focused on customer
on-time performance (Customer OTP) to gauge the quality of customers'
ridership experience on a service route level. Every Amtrak route that
involves CSX operates on track used by at least one other railroad, and
sometimes as many as five other railroads. CSX focuses on meeting its
contractual on-time performance (Contract OTP) standards as it is a
measure of CSX's individual performance as a host and is the negotiated
service metric between CSX and Amtrak.
Today, CSX is providing record-breaking service to Amtrak. In 2022,
CSX achieved its best Contract OTP in our history of hosting Amtrak
service. We closed out the year with 94.8% Contract OTP, a 2%
improvement over the prior year. This year (2023) is shaping up to be
our second best year as Contract OTP is currently at 94.3%. Since 2019,
CSX's Contract OTP has been above 90%, and CSX has been able to reduce
Amtrak delays per 10,000 miles by 23% since 2018. The following graph
illustrates CSX's success in improving Amtrak service quality on its
network.

CSX looks at four pillars when discussing passenger rail expansion
or new opportunities:
Number 1--Safety: The addition of new passenger service cannot
impact the safety of the line for our customers, employees, existing
passenger/commuter service, or surrounding communities.

Number 2--Capacity: There must be adequate capacity to meet our
current and future customer needs.

Number 3--Compensation: CSX must be fairly compensated for the
use of our infrastructure as well as maintenance costs.

And Number 4--Liability: CSX cannot take on additional liability
when additional passenger service is brought onto our freight corridor.

These four pillars are critical to the health of our nation's
supply chain and the safety of our communities. CSX's recent
transaction with the Commonwealth of Virginia is an example of how
strong adherence to these pillars can pave the way for the introduction
of enhanced passenger operations. The series of construction projects
included in the transaction are underway between Washington and
Richmond. This project is the fruit of a tremendous amount of effort by
Virginia, CSX and Amtrak and will result in a significant expansion of
VRE and Amtrak services while also preserving our ability to meet
current and future demand. Importantly, it shows that demand for both
freight and passenger rail service can be respected and protected when
the parties work together in an open and honest format that values the
interests of all parties.
Traveling through the Washington region has its challenges.
Currently there are 5.5 million Americans living and working in DC,
Maryland, and Virginia (DMV) and the DMV region is expected to grow by
another 1.5 million in the next two decades. Virginia has long sought
transportation solutions to better move both freight and people,
whether at the ports, on the highways, or over rail.
As part of its congestion planning, the Commonwealth began to
support freight projects that would add capacity by increasing road
clearances to allow double stack freight rail operations. When
completed, the route allows for double stack trains versus more train
frequency with single-stacked daily freight trains. At the same time,
the number of VRE and Amtrak trains operating on the CSX I-95 line
increased to 71 weekday trains. However, both VRE and Amtrak wanted to
double that number in the near future, and of course, CSX desires to
grow our freight traffic as well.
Freight rail, passenger rail, and governmental stakeholders found a
solution to balance these various transportation priorities. In 2019,
CSX signed a rail agreement selling Virginia 384 miles of CSX right-of-
way and 223 miles of track in freight rail corridors paralleling I-95,
I-64, and I-85. The Commonwealth purchased half of the CSX corridor
between Washington, DC and Petersburg, VA and all of the CSX owned
right-of-way between Petersburg and Ridgeway, NC, and agreed to build
new capacity on the entire corridor. As Virginia officials testified
last Congress before this Committee, this rail line purchase cost less
than adding a lane to the highway. The plan currently being implemented
will separate passenger and freight rail into parallel corridors, while
preserving access for both during maintenance or other incidents that
render a track temporarily inoperable. This way, freight and passenger
rail operators can support one another and avoid frequent conflicts
that can arise on shared-use track. The agreement also preserves
freight access to CSX's customers--now and in the future--on either
side of the corridor.
In 2020, Virginia created a new, independent state agency dedicated
to managing and funding passenger rail services. Congress also acted,
led by delegations from VA, DC, and MD, transferring NPS property
rights to DC and VA needed for a new passenger rail bridge over the
Potomac River. The corridor deal was announced in 2021, and through
dedicated funding from Virginia, investments from Amtrak, and federal
grants, the Commonwealth has begun projects to add capacity from DC to
Richmond, including that new passenger rail bridge.
Another great example of CSX's four pillars serving both freight
and passenger interests can be found in North Carolina. For the past
decade, CSX has partnered with North Carolina to expand freight rail
capacity in the state. We enhanced freight movements from Wilmington to
Charlotte and along our I-95 corridor. The state has also worked with
us on intermodal terminals in Charlotte and Rocky Mount. Those
terminals helped provide inland port solutions for congestion at ports
along the East Coast during recent supply chain challenges, as well as
an intermodal solution for the growing Raleigh metropolitan region and
Eastern North Carolina.
North Carolina has long expressed an interest in acquiring a
portion of CSX's S-Line, north of Raleigh, to better connect passenger
rail service in the state of North Carolina to Virginia and ultimately
Washington, DC and points north. As part of CSX's Virginia transaction
and to underscore the cooperative partnership with the state of North
Carolina, Virginia acquired a portion of the S-Line in North Carolina.
CSX has a signed, non-binding letter of intent with NC DOT based on
CSX's core passenger principles for NC DOT to purchase approximately 55
miles of the S-Line north of Raleigh. CSX has supported NC DOT's FY
2020 and FY 2021 CRISI applications, which were awarded to the state to
aid in buying the corridor and to begin preliminary engineering. NC DOT
is currently working with the state legislature to provide sufficient
liability protections and indemnification. We continue to work with NC
DOT on ways to improve their passenger rail opportunities, while
growing safe and efficient freight traffic.
One other example merits mentioning. In 2021, CSX acquired the Pan
Am Railroad operated throughout New England. CSX is working with the
New England Passenger Rail Authority on several projects that will
improve both the reliability and pave the way for an increase in the
Downeaster service. We are also in ongoing planning with the
Massachusetts Department of Transportation and pursuing a thoughtful
way to expand passenger rail operations in the Commonwealth between
Boston and Springfield.

On behalf of our President and CEO, Joe Hinrichs, and those of us
in leadership at CSX, we want to emphasize with Members of the
Committee that our company initiative called ONE CSX prioritizes
teamwork across all levels, all departments and all locations. This
transformative shift in our workplace culture is foundational to the
way we work together--operating as one team where all employees feel
valued, included, appreciated and able to contribute to our business
objectives to safely and reliably serve our customers who touch every
aspect of the public. We are optimistic about our ability to partner
with those in passenger rail services where it makes sense and where we
can plan ahead. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak to you
today.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mr. Daly.
Ms. Mortensen, you are recognized for 5 minutes for your
testimony.

TESTIMONY OF STACEY MORTENSEN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SAN JOAQUIN
JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY

Ms. Mortensen. Thank you. Good morning, Chairman Nehls,
Ranking Member Payne, and the members of this esteemed
subcommittee. My name is Stacey Mortensen. I serve as the
executive director of two different agencies. One oversees the
San Joaquins intercity service operated by Amtrak. The other
oversees the ACE commuter rail service to the bay area operated
by Herzog Transit Services. Both of these are in the major
northern California area.
Through this experience, I am asking you today to consider
thinking about different angles and different ways of State-
supported Amtrak services. In the new vision for passenger rail
service that the chairman and vice chairman talked about, a
one-size-fits-all approach is not going to work. So, let me
begin first by thanking quickly several of our local
representatives who take care of our service region:
Congressmembers Duarte, DeSaulnier, and LaMalfa.
California funds three of the largest intercity passenger
rail services operated by Amtrak. These three routes carried
over 3.2 million riders last year post-COVID, and that
accounted for about 40 percent of the Nation's State-supported
trips.
Eleven years ago, California passed a bill giving one of
our agencies the responsibility to protect and improve the
service for the San Joaquin Corridor and the riders. It cost
nearly $100 million per year and covers almost 400 miles, and
the service also includes connecting thruway bus, one of the
biggest in the country, to give access to residents who aren't
right near the rail line.
This service has proven critical to a very challenging
demographic within the San Joaquin Corridor. Passenger
household incomes are some of the lowest in the country, and
yet a majority of those passengers continued to ride during the
COVID pandemic shutdown when trains were limited. It proved to
us over time this was the only option these people had. And San
Joaquins have recovered probably one of the best of all
services under Amtrak operation.
Twenty-five years ago, I was also part of the startup of
the ACE commuter rail service, and experienced more of a
bootstrap method for getting rail service implemented using
local and county revenues and a very competitive process.
Herzog is our operator and has been our operator on that
service for 25 years.
One of the few things that the San Joaquins and the ACE
train have in common is we operate on the Class I freight
railroads. We have learned over this time that, to be
successful with these partners, we need to understand the
freight business goals, we need to commit to funding capacity
improvements that move both freight and passenger trains, and
we need to learn to coexist. And I think that is important in
this new vision for additional rail.
Our host rail lines, Union Pacific and BNSF, they have been
consistent allies with us in our planning process for more
service. But a key factor in maintaining those relationships
has been another shared aspect between the two services, and
that is collaborative governance. While each agency I represent
has its own elected board with its own constituents, each
governing board agrees to assume the roles that they are
strongest at.
To avoid duplication, play to their strengths, streamline
decisions, and respond quickly to changing conditions that we
see, they delegate decisionmaking to each other, which is a
little bit rare, but it makes the most sense. And I think the
railroads appreciate this approach because it recognizes that
accommodating passenger rail service on their lines can be
difficult, and we work in good faith to accomplish those goals.
But at the national level, there are processes and
legislation that can set back those hard-earned gains.
Sometimes expansion efforts, especially nationalized, are
plagued with long delivery times. Centralized decisionmaking
often means those who are ready have to wait for those who are
not. These national processes and changes to those processes
are geared towards national expediency, which sometimes
Congress does ask Amtrak to achieve, but it comes at the cost
of protecting and improving the services for the passengers
that rely on them. These people who truly pay for the service,
they don't understand the labyrinths that we have to go through
to make improvements and to add trains. They just want to get
on board. They just want to take their trip.
We do, however, have a few bright spots. We have some new
models emerging that I hope you take into account. They are
through discussions with Amtrak, host railroads, FRA, and the
State, and it figures out a way to right-size the roles. It
plays to the strengths of each of the parties: Who can do what
best, who can do what most efficiently, and who can reach down
to the constituents who ride the trains and make sure their
input is incorporated.
I am asking the members of this subcommittee to be
supportive of a new and improved effort. I hope the advocacy
will lead to the option to customize appropriate paths forward
for each unique situation or region, something that's a little
impossible today.
Honestly, right-sizing today will allow us to get it right
tomorrow. Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Stacey Mortensen, Executive Director, San Joaquin
Joint Powers Authority
Introduction
Good morning, Chairman Nehls, Ranking Member Payne, and Members of
this esteemed Subcommittee. My name is Stacey Mortensen and I am the
Executive Director of the San Joaquin Joint Powers Authority (SJJPA),
which oversees a state-supported Amtrak route known as the San Joaquins
service. I also serve as Executive Director of the San Joaquin Regional
Rail Commission (SJRRC) which oversees the Altamont Corridor Express
(ACE) commuter rail service. Both services run through California's
Central Valley and into the metropolitan areas of Sacramento and the
San Francisco Bay Area. Through these two roles, I have been fortunate
to experience the ins and outs of passenger rail service from many
different angles. Today, I am asking you to consider thinking about the
state-supported Amtrak services in a different way going forward
because in the new vision for expanded passenger rail throughout the
country, one size does not fit all.
Let me first begin by thanking several of our local representatives
on this Subcommittee. They are the information pipelines between our
communities and the complex decision-making process at the national
level. I had the pleasure of getting to know Congressman Duarte during
his recent tour of our Stockton Rail Maintenance Facility. He continues
to express his desire to fully understand the transportation issues in
our region of California and be a thoughtful advocate in Congress. I
would also like to express my appreciation of the tremendous leadership
of Congressman DeSaulnier, who is our longtime, valued resource on all
transportation issues affecting the greater San Francisco Bay Area. We
are honored to have the opportunity to serve his constituents on both
the ACE and San Joaquins services. Finally, although not a member of
this Subcommittee, we would like to thank Congressman Harder, who has
been a tremendous advocate for increased rail service around the
greater Stockton area and continues to work with us on potential
legislative solutions to ensure efficient and cost-effective passenger
rail in the Central Valley.
California is home to the nation's largest state-supported
intercity passenger rail network operated by Amtrak. The Pacific
Surfliner, the Capitol Corridor, and the San Joaquins intercity
services make up the top three highest ridership services in the United
States outside of the Northeast Corridor. Even in the post-COVID
environment that has crippled most transit and passenger rail services,
these three routes carried over 3.2 million riders this last year,
which accounts for nearly 40% of all state-supported passenger
trips.\1\ And by ``state-supported,'' I must emphasize that this means
our passengers and our state taxpayers fully cover the entire operating
and capital costs for the service. We do not receive any annual federal
funding.

California's intercity rail system connects the major populated
areas of San Diego, Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Bakersfield,
Stockton, Oakland, San Jose, and Sacramento. Additionally, our
extensive thruway bus services provide connections to an additional 122
destinations throughout the state.
Over the last four decades, California has invested nearly $8
billion in improving its intercity passenger rail network. Our state
maintains a proven track record of planning, delivering, and expanding
both passenger rail and freight rail projects. We owe much of our
success to sustained advocacy in Sacramento and the consistent state
funding support of our rail programs by our state legislature and state
rail staff.
Intercity Passenger Rail in California & CIRCLE
In 2021, we consolidated the advocacy efforts for the Pacific
Surfliner, Capitol Corridor, and San Joaquins to form California's
Intercity Rail Corridor Linking Everyone (CIRCLE). This coalition
focuses on uniting policymakers and partner agencies on the need to
preserve the past passenger rail investment and continue strategic
future investment throughout the state. These discussions continue to
include strong partnerships with the Federal Railroad Administration,
Amtrak, Class I railroads, and labor groups. We also encourage
innovation and flexibility in service delivery as the expectations in
California and throughout the nation clearly dictate that one size does
not fit all. We look forward to being an ongoing resource to this
Subcommittee.
While I am not here to testify specifically about the California
High Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA), I know this topic is of great
interest to the Subcommittee. I serve as a member of the Peer Review
Group established by California Law AB 3034 and can discuss the
findings and conclusions highlighted in the March 23, 2023 report that
specifically impacts SJPPA's role as a provider of intercity passenger
rail service in the Central Valley \2\.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background on San Joaquins
In 2012, the California legislature passed AB 1779 to protect and
improve existing rail service throughout the San Joaquin Corridor. The
corridor runs up the Central Valley from Bakersfield to Stockton and
then splits to take riders to Sacramento or Oakland. The route spans
365 miles, includes 7 daily round trips (6 currently running post-
pandemic), provides 18 stations, and has been entirely funded by the
state for many years. Even when factoring in the state-supported routes
within the Northeast Corridor, the San Joaquins are Amtrak's fifth-
busiest service. The San Joaquins also include the most extensive
connecting bus program in the country at $20 million per year, which is
as big or bigger than many of the other state-supported rail routes.
During Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, the San Joaquins carried 1.1 million
passengers and the state provided over $50 million in subsidies. During
the pandemic, the San Joaquins were reduced to 5 roundtrip trains, but
had the highest ridership in the nation over many months. In this last
Fiscal Year with 6 out of 7 roundtrips running at 85% of full service,
ridership reached 850,000, or 79% of pre-COVID levels. This indicates
that the San Joaquins have a strong elasticity despite other negative
impacts in the larger environment. This is particularly worth exploring
further because the San Joaquins riders have some of the lowest
household incomes nationwide.
Background on Altamont Corridor Express (ACE) Service
I was part of the start-up of the ACE commuter rail program in 1998
and learned the `boot strap' method of funding and delivering a
passenger rail program through local revenues and competitive
procurement. The ACE service provides 4 weekday trains in the peak
period and runs over an 86-mile route between the Central Valley and
Silicon Valley, with Herzog Transit Services as our operations and
maintenance contractor. Pre-pandemic, ACE trains handled 6,500 daily
passenger trips and over 1.5 million annual riders. However, as the ACE
passengers are primarily peak period commuters, pandemic related remote
work models have had a significant impact on ridership. Ridership is
currently at 50% of pre-COVID levels but has been steadily increasing.
The federal COVID relief transit operating funding passed by Congress
in the CARES Act (P.L. 116-136), CRRSA (P.L. 116-260), and ARPA (P.L.
117-2) was a lifeline that kept trains running at minimum levels for
essential workers--and we thank you for making that tough decision.
We are working closely with Central Valley, Sacramento, and Bay
Area Economic Councils to monitor the evolution of the new hybrid work
models and the changing commuting patterns. Flexibility in responding
to these factors could make or break the success of future passenger
rail services.
Critical Collaboration
The San Joaquins and ACE trains both operate on Class 1 railroads.
To have a successful partnership for existing and expanded passenger
rail service, a public agency must understand freight company business
goals and commit to fund network capacity improvements that keep
freight and passenger trains moving. Union Pacific and BNSF have been
consistent allies in planning for our service expansion. A key factor
in maintaining these relationships is the efficient governance models
between the elected boards for ACE and San Joaquins services. Rather
than duplicate the governance effort and create potentially competing
interests, the two boards share one consolidated staff and one vision
for providing passenger rail between the Central Valley, Sacramento,
and Bay Area. Each board assumes the roles that play to their
strengths. The San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission that oversees the
ACE service focuses on ground game--day-to-day operations and
maintenance, engineering and construction, negotiations with the host
railroads, and rolling stock procurement. The San Joaquin Joint Powers
Authority focuses on planning in the larger geographic area and
communicating the opportunities and challenges to the state for overall
rail network integration. This board is also responsible for
negotiations with the state and the California High Speed Rail
Authority to operate an interim service on the new high-speed
infrastructure in the Central Valley. This shared governance model is a
departure from the usual agency oversight and has saved time, money,
and has streamlined the coordination effort between the numerous
service partners. Such efficiencies will be required to advance new
state and national passenger rail goals.
One Size Does Not Fit All
I want to share a few examples that show where a national approach
to state-supported passenger rail programs can be flawed. Over the past
few years, California and the current Federal Railroad Administration
have committed unprecedented levels of funding to new and improved
passenger rail service and the transition toward zero-emission
trainsets. These visions have been percolating for a while, but with
serious money on the table, there are serious expectations of
simultaneous advancement in many corridors and across many fleets. And
yet, the general intercity passenger rail environment has not been a
place of speedy transition or evolution. Under the current framework,
the dreams of more accessible rail service to more populations could
take decades or stall altogether.
Timely innovation efforts in a highly regulated industry with a
centralized national railroad will inevitably face numerous barriers.
Recent service expansions and new service have been plagued with
excessively long planning, negotiation, procurement, and delivery
times. Centralized decision-making often means those who are ready have
to wait for those who are not. Equipment procurements or modifications
can be bogged down waiting for over two dozen parties (and their
attorneys) to agree on excruciating details. When there are national
processes in place, changes to those processes can be geared toward
centralized expediency (which Congress has often pressured Amtrak to
achieve) rather than protecting and improving the services for the
passengers who rely upon them.
Last year, I was the sole state vote against the new State-Amtrak
Intercity Passenger Rail Committee (SAIPRC) cost model required by the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). It is likely that I will
once again vote against the upcoming standardized cost rate for
service. This time, however, I may not be the only one. It is not about
whether the costs are higher or lower under the model, but rather
because the 2019 cost data, which is used as the baseline in the new
cost allocation rate, were grossly inaccurate due to Amtrak's inability
to provide clear back up for the inflated expenses. Again, the national
interests were pushed forward to meet a deadline, but our San Joaquins
service continues to suffer on account of these inaccurate cost
allocations that cannot be explained. This significantly hampers our
ability to sustain and grow the service.
Ironically, when a service change negatively impacts California, it
does significant harm to the largest Amtrak cost center outside of the
Northeast Corridor. The double irony for our San Joaquins service is
that we receive no federal funding. Our state and our riders pay all
the operations and maintenance costs, which are now nearing $100
million per year. National decisions have crippled our service without
justification, and yet, the established Passenger Rail Investment and
Improvement Act of 2008 (PRIIA) framework sticks us with the check, and
we are left with no other option but to foot the bill.
In fact, even when Amtrak acknowledges that there is a problem in
this arena and attempts to make changes, as was noted in the January
2022 Amtrak OIG report, the vast majority of state partners continue to
have lingering distrust with the new national data. This further
demonstrates that the one size fits all national approach set up by
Section 209 of PRIIA is fundamentally broken.\3\

Right Size--Right Place
Another example where one size does not fit all relates to the
state's desire for a more rapid deployment of zero emission
technologies for trainsets. Demonstration programs are being developed
for battery, hydrogen, and various hybrid solutions for rail
applications. Rail corridors have different requirements based upon
grades, curvature, station stops, and length of route. We are part of
several different demonstration efforts for locomotive-hauled and
multiple unit trainsets. These will require close coordination and
nimble response to host railroad feedback in specific corridor-by-
corridor discussions. Integration between the San Joaquins and ACE
service with the interim high speed rail service will also be a complex
process. We can appreciate the general benefits of a national,
standardized fleet transition for emission reductions, but also know
the pace of such an effort and the standardized outcome, much like the
cost allocation formula, may not result in an outcome that is
beneficial for the San Joaquin corridor.
California owns the fleet for the San Joaquins and Capitol Corridor
in the northern part of the state. The state has resolute goals for
fleet modernization, emissions reductions, and improved passenger
experience. This cannot be accomplished in the expected timeframe
through a national framework, particularly when there are so many plans
for new services and expansion around the country. Each region in
California may require different approaches depending on geography,
demographics, and connections to other transportation options. The same
is true for the state's equity objectives. Local and regional nuances
will dictate the most effective and meaningful strategies. The creation
of the three interregional Joint Powers Authorities (JPAs) was a
concerted effort to drive oversight and decision-making down from the
state level closer to communities and the passengers. True
transformation will require flexibility and adaptability that the
historic national model has not offered.
There are, however, a few bright spots. A new model is emerging
from our discussions with Amtrak, host railroads, FRA, and the state.
The parties are evaluating the rightsizing of national and state level
efforts on the San Joaquins and assigning responsibilities that make
sense. This extends the reach of each player and allows more progress
to be accomplished toward state and national goals simultaneously. We
have the expertise to focus on advancing our equipment strategies and
Amtrak has the turnkey expertise to get the new services on the ground
quickly.
California has detailed plans for unique rolling stock modification
and rehabilitation of our state-owned fleet to reflect the regions and
communities that are served. The interior mock-ups we have done with
the state give passengers a connection to their rail service beyond the
utility of connecting from ``point A to point B.'' We want the journey
to be as important as the destination, including the connecting bus
trips, which currently feel like a lesser experience than the train
trip. While California is also pursuing aggressive goals for electric
and autonomous vehicles, the highway gridlock is predicted to worsen
and moving people by train and connecting bus becomes increasingly
important. Under the historical national maintenance model, these train
equipment modifications would be difficult, if not impossible, to
achieve. But, under a new strategic model with Amtrak and FRA, a more
localized workforce effort would address these equipment needs, and the
national workforce effort would focus on the impending expansion
efforts throughout the nation.
In closing, having experienced both the failure of what I call the
national one size fits all policy and the success managing regional
service with a localized decision-making model, we have clearly seen
what a path forward looks like for successful intercity passenger rail
policy. This experience informs us that now is the right time and place
to rectify the efforts to build passenger rail service that is demanded
of us for the future and I ask that the members of this Subcommittee be
supportive of this effort. I suspect that other services across the
country have shared similar experiences. My hope is that our advocacy
will lead to an outcome that will provide us all with the flexibility
to rightsize and customize the appropriate path forward for each unique
route, something that is impossible today. In short, rightsizing today
will allow us to get it right tomorrow.
I look forward to answering any questions the Subcommittee may have
about our program and experiences managing the two publicly funded
passenger rail services.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Ms. Mortensen. I now recognize Dr.
Ohanian.
Am I saying that correctly?

TESTIMONY OF LEE E. OHANIAN, Ph.D., DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR OF
ECONOMICS, UCLA, AND SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION,
STANFORD UNIVERSITY

Mr. Ohanian. Chair Nehls, Ranking Member Payne, committee
members, thank you for inviting me to testify today. I am Lee
Ohanian. I am a professor of economics at UCLA and a senior
fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution.
High-speed rail, which I will refer to as HSR, poses
challenges regarding costs and project delays. My comments
today will focus on addressing these problems, drawing on
lessons from California's HSR experience. I will frame my
testimony around four issues: one, understanding the large
risks and uncertainties accompanying these projects; two, the
value of third-party evaluations to provide independent
assessments; three, reducing HSR construction costs; and four,
the promise of private-sector HSR.
As a Californian, I wish I could tell you we have made
significant HSR progress. We haven't. The project is extremely
delayed, and its 2008 budget has increased by a factor of 4 to
about $128 billion. Some of this reflects mistakes in
management and accountability, but it also reflects the failure
to identify and mitigate the risks and uncertainties with
projects of this size.
This failure dates back to 2008, when California's
nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office reviewed California's
HSR business plan and found it lacking in the following areas:
failure to describe how funding would be secured; failure to
describe how costs would be allocated, failure to provide a
break-even point, failure to present the methods used to
forecast ridership, failure to provide environmental review
completion dates, and failure to describe how these and other
risks would be mitigated.
Put differently, California HSR began its life with $10
billion in voter-approved bond funding, but without a
legitimate business plan. The legislative analysts were
prescient, as the deficiencies that they identified have
negatively impacted HSR from its beginning.
The California High-Speed Rail Authority should have
focused on identifying risks and their mitigations and should
have been more forthcoming about these issues. The project is
now roughly 20 years behind schedule, and its budget has
ballooned from about $33 billion to about $128 billion.
The lessons from California are clear: Projects should
provide a comprehensive and detailed business plan that itemize
all identifiable risks; that provide cost-effective, doable
mitigations; and that build in a sizable cost buffer to address
the unforeseen problems that frequently occur in such large
capital investments.
Acknowledging risk also means using a higher discount rate
for the purpose of cost-benefit analyses, which are the
foundation of capital investment project evaluation.
California's HSR benefit cost study uses a 7-percent discount
rate. In my opinion, this discount rate is too low, given the
project's risky history and given our current interest rate
environment.
The second recommendation is using third-party evaluations
of HSR proposals. The State's Legislative Analyst's Office was
not alone in identifying California's HSR deficiencies. Others
include the Reason Foundation and the Cato Institute. Both
expressed concerns about ridership forecasted levels and
forecasted costs, both of which they viewed as unrealistic.
These concerns were dismissed, however. If they had been heard,
I suspect we could have managed HSR in California more
effectively.
Third-party analyses are equally valuable today, as
California builds a $35 billion, 171-mile segment between
Bakersfield and Merced in California's Central Valley. The
California High-Speed Rail Authority projects this segment
would reduce State driving only by about one-twentieth of 1
percent by 2030. These statistics raise concerns. Utilizing
third-party assessments by disinterested experts would be
valuable in evaluating the viability of California HSR and
other projects.
California's high construction costs, now over $200 million
per mile, highlight the problem of U.S. railway costs more
broadly. Some recent European HSR projects cost about half as
much. Our high costs were acknowledged by Secretary Buttigieg 2
years ago, but the causes of our high costs remain unknown.
Some evidence points to lengthy and costly environmental
reviews that significantly delay U.S. projects. We need to
prioritize bringing construction costs down so that our
projects are economical and conserve Federal funding.
My fourth point is about building private-sector HSR.
Brightline Holdings is set to build a 228-mile HSR route
between southern California and Las Vegas. Despite being 50
miles longer than the State's Bakersfield-Merced segment,
Brightline's projected $12 billion cost represents a 64-percent
savings compared to California HSR, and Brightline's expected
completion is just 4 years away.
Private-sector HSR is incentivized to find routes where
there is substantial demand, which is what we all want, and
they are also incentivized to build efficiently, which is what
we all want. This suggests significant potential for private-
public HSR partnerships.
I hope this testimony is informative, and I look forward to
your questions. Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Lee E. Ohanian, Ph.D., Distinguished Professor of
Economics, UCLA, and Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution, Stanford
University
Challenges in Implementing High Speed Rail:
Lessons From California's Experience
Chair Graves, Chair Nehls, Ranking Member Larsen, Ranking Member
Payne, and members of the Transportation and Infrastructure
Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials, thank
you for inviting me to testify at the hearing ``Getting on the Right
Track: Navigating the Future of Intercity Passenger Rail in America.''
My testimony today will focus on our existing and potential future
investments in High-Speed Rail (hereafter HSR). The goal of HSR is
laudable: Provide an alternative transportation mode that offers a
combination of transportation time, cost, and convenience that is
competitive with auto and air travel. However, implementing HSR has
been challenging in the U.S. in terms of cost and construction delays,
both of which reflect the large number of risks that can accompany
large-scale projects. I will discuss these challenges with a focus on
California's problematic experience with building an HSR system, an
experience that provides key implications and cautionary evidence for
other HSR investments.
California's Problems in Building HSR
California began the process of building HSR 30 years ago, with the
creation of California Intercity High-Speed Rail Commission in 1993.
This commission was replaced in 1996 by California's High-Speed Rail
Authority (hereafter CHSRA), which continues to manage California's HSR
project.
California's HSR project has little to show over this 30-year
period. The project is significantly delayed, and its budget has
increased to about four times its initial cost. Some of this is due to
mistakes in planning, management, oversight, and accountability. But
other factors reflect more endemic challenges in building HSR,
including limitations in understanding the scope and size of the
problems and risks that can arise in such a major infrastructure
project.
While the magnitude of California's problems is perhaps unique, the
nature and characteristics of these problems provide lessons for other
HSR investments, which I will describe below.
The Importance of Identifying and Accounting for Risk and Uncertainty
California's HSR was plagued by significant problems from its
inception. An early problem was inadequate planning. The CHSRA had 12
years to create a business plan before California voters approved a
2008 $9.95 billion ballot initiative bond measure as seed money to
begin the process of building an 800-mile system that would connect Los
Angeles to San Francisco, and California's central valley to the coast,
at a cost of about $33 billion. Completion for the key route--San
Francisco to Los Angeles--was expected around 2020.
The project's initial business plan was judged to be deficient by
California's Legislative Analyst's Office \1\, a non-partisan state
agency that advises the state legislature on implementing cost-
effective and efficient budget policies. Their evaluation of the plan
found that it did not present information on several key issues,
including train capacity, forecasts of segment service levels, how
funds would be secured, how costs would be distributed by system
segment, an operating break-even point, what analytical methods were
used to forecast ridership, expected completion dates for environmental
reviews, and how risks would be mitigated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ https://lao.ca.gov/handouts/transportation/2010/
2009_High_Speed_Rail_01_12_10.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The plan was legally required to have been delivered to the
California Senate in September 2008, about two months prior to the
state's general election. However, the plan was not provided until
after the election. Had it been presented to state senators on time as
legally required, then the project's planning deficiencies and
omissions could have been identified and this information could have
been provided to Californians before they voted on whether to approve
bond funding. And that information may have been enough to change the
outcome of the $9.95 billion bond issue, which passed with 52.6 percent
of the vote in the general election.
The omissions and deficiencies in the 2008 business plan are
significant and unacceptable. But at the same time, one can imagine
similar omissions/mistakes occurring with other HSR systems,
particularly issues such as the failure to address the mitigation of
risks. One reason is because there are so many risks involved with such
a large project that it becomes nearly impossible to itemize and
address them, including some that may simply be unknown.
This is not an excuse for CHSRA's failure to address the
fundamental issue of risk mitigation. Rather, it is an acknowledgement
that the substantial uncertainties and risks associated with such
massive projects should be communicated to stakeholders, which in my
opinion was not done by the CHSRA.
It now seems clear that such a large-scale project should not have
been pursued. The first hint of this can be seen in the Legislative
Analyst's report, which identified not just omissions in the original
business plan, but a plan that realistically could not provide what was
needed. The project was too big, with far too many uncertainties and
risks to address, and with too many forecasts that may have been little
more than assumptions.
An important lesson from California's experience is that the
uncertainties and risks of a project need to be soberly confronted and
built into how such a project is discounted regarding its present value
evaluation. However, honestly acknowledging these risks and
uncertainties will be resisted by those who are advocates of such
projects, because once stakeholders understand the enormous
uncertainties that accompany these investments, they may no longer be
willing to commit resources to them.
Note that a reasonable acknowledgment of risks--which was omitted
from California's HSR business plan--may reverse the conclusion of
standard benefit-cost analyses that use discount rates that are too low
for such risky/uncertain projects. California's HSR necessitates a
higher prevent value discount rate, which in turn reduces the value of
its benefits, because project benefits are not realized until well into
the future, while the bulk of project costs are paid up front.
The Importance of Third-Party Project Evaluations
The evolution of California's HSR in the last 15 years illustrates
how projects of such size and scope can be significantly delayed and
can substantially exceed their budgets. The significant concerns
expressed by California's Legislative Analyst's Office roughly 15 years
ago regarding risk mitigation, lack of funding sources, and lack of
details about key aspects of the project, have proven to be remarkably
prescient in understanding why California's HSR is so delayed and why
costs have increased so much. To date, not one train segment is close
to completion, and the system's delay is accompanied by a roughly four-
fold increase in the system's projected cost, which now likely exceeds
$120 billion, and which pencils out to over $200 million per mile.
To put California's HSR delays and cost increases in perspective,
the projected cost of building a 171-mile segment between the towns of
Bakersfield and Merced, the latter of which has a population of around
90,000 (California's 86th largest city) exceeds the 2008 projected cost
of the entire system. Moreover, the projected completion date for this
first segment may extend to 2033, roughly 25 years after voters passed
the $9.95 billion bond issue.
A $35 billion, single HSR route between Bakersfield and Merced
would have been rejected by voters in 2008. Yet this is the status of
California's HSR today, with well over $30 billion to be invested in a
single route that is far from a priority transportation corridor within
the state.
California's HSR system did not break ground until 2016, eight
years after the bond issue, and 20 years after the formation of CHSRA.
Construction delays reflect delays in acquiring land, delays in
environmental reviews, and several lawsuits. All these problems were
explicitly or implicitly recognized by the Legislative Analyst's Office
in 2008. By the time construction had begun in 2016, the cost for the
system had already doubled. Today, the cost has nearly quadrupled, and
will almost certainly rise in the future.
Lack of funding, another key deficiency identified by the
Legislative Analyst's Office, has also turned out to be a major problem
with California HSR. The original vision of the project marketed to
Californians was that the system would attract considerable private
funding, which in turn would help pay for the up-front capital costs.
To date, there has been no private funding and there appears to be no
current possibility of private funding.
The system's funding deficiency is a key reason why California is
building Bakerfield-Merced route first, a segment that is far from a
priority route, because construction costs on that segment are
relatively low. This route is flat, and thus construction does not have
to deal with tunneling, building viaducts, and other high-cost features
that are present on other routes, including the Los Angeles-San
Francisco route, which includes the complication of considerable
seismic issues.
This is the consequence of forcing a project when it should never
have been initiated. And if there was any doubt about its viability
when it was initiated, it could have been stopped long ago when it
became apparent that it was not economically sensible. The forcing of
HSR after bond approval has been in place since at least 2013, when a
judge ruled that he would not validate the bond because the project did
not have a valid financing plan, which was required under the bond
measure. Michael Tennenbaum, the first chair of CHSRA noted just last
year ``I was totally naive when I took the job . . . I (ultimately)
realized the system didn't work. I just wasn't smart enough. I don't
know how they can build it now \2\.''

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The failure to develop a funding pathway for this project was a key
error on the part of California's political leaders, and a violation of
voter trust. However, funding deficiencies, and the challenges
associated with such deficiencies, could arise even for HSR projects
that have funding pathways, but that may confront higher costs than
planned. This important issue is connected to an honest assessment of
risks and uncertainties that can delay a project or increase project
cost.
Other third-party studies of California HSR expressed significant
concerns about the project around the time of the bond issue, including
an analysis performed by the Reason Foundation \3\. The Reason study
identified a separate set of concerns to those raised by the
Legislative Analyst's Office. These include overly optimistic ridership
projections, underestimated cost projections, overestimated impact on
greenhouse gas emissions, overstated average travel speeds, and
overestimated profitability.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the most striking points made by the Reason study is the
remarkably optimistic CHRSA assumptions regarding ridership intensity
(passenger miles/route mile) for California HSR. Specifically, CHRSA
assumed that ridership intensity would substantially exceed that in
Japan and Europe, countries that make far greater use of rapid transit
than the U.S., which have less auto ownership, and which have more
densely populated cities. The ridership intensity forecast also
exceeded that of Amtrak's Acela line, one of the highest speed lines in
the country, by a factor of nearly 40. It is noteworthy that since the
original business plan, CHSRA has scaled back projected ridership by
about 25 percent.
Another key point in the Reason study was addressing the amount of
greenhouse gas emission reductions resulting from California's HSR. The
challenge with any argument made for a project based on greenhouse gas
emissions must confront the fact that greenhouse gases are a global
issue, with China now contributing about 30 percent of the global
total. California contributes less than one percent of global
emissions. There is virtually nothing that California on its own can
feasibly do to move the carbon emissions needle. The Reason study
calculated that if implemented, California HSR would reduce California
carbon emissions by less than two percent. This means that California
HSR would have a miniscule impact on climate change.
More broadly, the California economy has evolved in ways that could
not have been predicted back in 2008, and these evolutions suggest that
HSR may be considerably less important now. This includes the state's
mandate that only electrical vehicles will be sold after 2034, that the
state's population is shrinking, and the rising importance of remote
work, which now accounts for about 30 percent of employees \4\.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Independent, third-party analyses are important, yet the Reason
study and other analyses raising concerns about California's HSR were
largely dismissed at the time. It is critical that qualified experts
who express concerns about such projects be given due consideration.
U.S. Rail Construction Costs Need to Be Reduced
California's 2008 $33 billion cost estimate for the entire state
HSR project was far too low, but this cost estimate was used to attract
voter and other political support for the project. The cost now is
about four times as high as the original estimate. This is perhaps not
surprising, because building rail transportation in the United State is
extremely costly, and we should understand why this is the case so that
projects can be built much more cost effectively. Secretary Buttigieg
acknowledged the high cost of U.S. railroad construction, but offered
no explanation, noting that the issue needed further study \5\. It is
imperative we understand this cost discrepancy between the U.S. and
other countries.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

america
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The U.S. railway cost record compared to that of other countries
suggests that there is substantial room for improvement. We rank as the
sixth most expensive country out of 58 countries in terms of railway
infrastructure costs, measured per kilometer of distance. Moreover, the
five counties that are more expensive that the U.S. build about 80
percent of their railway infrastructure using the very costly process
of tunneling. In contrast, only about 37 percent of U.S. railways are
constructed using tunneling. Moreover, many countries that use
tunneling much more extensively than the U.S. have much lower costs
than the U.S. This includes Spain, Portugal, Finland, and South Korea,
all of which have railway construction costs that are on average 80
percent less than U.S. costs.
Comparing costs of specific projects between the U.S. and Europe
drives home the importance of identifying what the U.S. can do better
to build railway more efficiently. This includes New York's Second
Avenue Subway, at $2.6 billion per mile, San Francisco's Central Subway
at $920 million per mile, and Los Angeles's Purple Line at $800 million
per mile, which stand in sharp contrast to projects in Copenhagen,
Paris, and Madrid with costs of $323 million per mile, $160 million per
mile, and $320 million per mile, respectively \6\.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ Op. Cit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Potential of Private Sector HSR Projects
Private sector HSR projects may offer a substantial benefit, in
conjunction as partners with the public sector. Brightline Holdings,
Inc. is scheduled to begin building a 228-mile route between Southern
California and Las Vegas, Nevada soon. Despite a route that is more
than 50 miles longer than the State's HSR leg between Bakersfield and
Merced, the projected cost of the Brightline route is about $12
billion, representing a 64 percent savings compared to California HSR.
The project is expected to be completed in early 2027, less than four
years after breaking ground.
Key positives regarding private sector projects is that they are
incentivized to find routes where there is substantial demand. This is
important because Americans have generally been reluctant to take mass
transit, despite decades of state, local, and federal subsidies for
this transportation model. To put this in context, the Urban Institute
notes that since 1970, the U.S. economy has added about 77 million
workers, but during this same 50-year period, transit commuters have
only increased by one million riders.\7\ One projection by HSR
proponents was that President Obama's 2009 national HSR project would
have carried fewer than 0.5 percent of U.S. passenger miles.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/us-public-transit-has-
struggled-retain-riders-over-past-half-century-reversing-trend-could-
advance-equity-and-sustainability
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This suggests that it is imperative to identify the routes that are
truly valued by consumers and businesses, and no agency is better
incentivized to do this than private operators. The private sector is
similarly incentivized to build efficiently, at reasonable costs. This
is evidenced by Brightline's 2/3 cost savings compared to California's
HSR. This discussion suggests that private-public partnerships may be a
very effective approach to strategically picking HSR where it is
desired, and where it can be built efficiently.
Conclusions
Your committee provides important stewardship over our existing
transportation networks and their future evolution. The goal of our
future transportation investments is to provide cost-effective
transportation enhancements that are highly valued by U.S. households
and businesses alike, enhancements that will significantly reduce the
costs of moving people and goods across our country and between our
cities. These investments have historically played a key role in
facilitating America's economic growth, investments ranging from the
roads, turnpikes, railroads and canals of the 1800s, to the more recent
interstate highway and airport investments.
Congress has a remarkable historical record in identifying
fundamentally needed transportation infrastructure and facilitating the
efficient construction of that infrastructure. Your record reflects the
guiding principles of identifying investments that will deliver the
greatest benefits, at reasonable costs. The investments cited here
changed the face of the American economy. It is unlikely, however, that
HSR will have nearly the same impact as any of these earlier
investments. Indeed, California's record in trying to create a
statewide HSR system provides important evidence for what can go wrong.
This does not mean that HSR can't play an important role in
targeted areas where high consumer and/or business demand exists for
HSR, and where construction costs can be reduced to levels much lower
than they are today. Partnering strategically with the private sector
appears to offer the greatest promise in realizing the benefits of HSR,
as the private sector is maximally incentivized to identify routes
where HSR can make the greatest impact, and to create HSR in the most
efficient way. Thank you for this opportunity to contribute to your
important mission. I look forward to your questions.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Doctor. I now recognize Austin Mayor
Watson.
Thank you for being here from the great State of Texas.
Welcome, welcome. You are recognized for 5 minutes, sir.

TESTIMONY OF HON. KIRK WATSON, MAYOR, CITY OF AUSTIN, TEXAS

Mr. Watson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Ranking
Member and members of the subcommittee. As indicated, my name
is Kirk Watson, and I am the mayor of Austin, Texas. And I want
to thank you for the opportunity to testify here today and
provide the perspective of a local elected official on this
important issue.
My written testimony goes into significant detail about
several items related to intercity passenger rail, including
support for the significant investment made by the IIJA and
Amtrak's plans for using that funding. So, I am going to focus
my oral testimony on our local view and the value that could be
obtained.
At the broadest level, I am eager to do anything I can to
support improved intercity passenger rail in Texas. Texas and
its cities are leading the Nation in growth, and we desperately
need to improve multimodal mobility between our cities and
metropolitan areas that are the bedrock of our State's thriving
economy.
When Austin's tiny Amtrak station was built in 1947,
Austin's population was just over 100,000. Today, our
population is nearly 10 times that amount, making Austin the
10th largest city in America. Austin has been the fastest
growing metropolitan area since 2010. The metropolitan area
population now exceeds 2.4 million people. And of course, other
Texas cities and metropolitan areas are experiencing similarly
robust growth. Austin is planning a multibillion-dollar
investment in our rapidly growing airport, in transit, and
roadway improvements, and the Texas Department of
Transportation and other Texas local governments are investing
tens of billions of dollars more on highways, local roads, and
transit.
However, the highways and airports connecting Texas cities
simply can't keep up with the demands of our State's economy
and the mobility needs of its people. And so, I am glad that
Federal agencies and Amtrak and TxDOT and Texas cities and
counties are looking to improve intercity passenger rail
service in Texas and, more specifically, in what we call the
Texas Triangle.
The three transportation corridors in Texas that are
anchored by Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio are
often referred to as the Texas Triangle. The cities and
metropolitan areas of the triangle are home to 21 million
people, account for 70 percent of all Texans, and 74.2 percent
of the Texas economy. It's experiencing rapid population
growth, accounting for 88 percent of Texas' population growth
between 2010 and 2020.
Austin is located along the western leg of the triangle
that links San Antonio, Austin, Fort Worth, and Dallas. Those 4
cities along the 310-mile western leg are all, all 4 of them,
among the 13 largest cities in the United States, with an
additional 800,000 people living along that leg in the Waco and
Killeen-Temple area. By contrast, only 2 of the 13 largest U.S.
cities, New York City and Philadelphia, are located along the
Boston-to-Washington Northeast Corridor.
I would argue that the Texas Triangle is the lowest hanging
fruit in the Nation for improving intercity passenger rail
service. Projections show that the developing passenger rail
service in that triangle will produce robust ridership, with a
relatively modest capital investment because of the population,
the density of that population, the economy, and the
demographics.
For example, the San Antonio to Dallas-Fort Worth corridor
has all of the attributes that you would think would apply to
the demand for passenger rail service: four major metropolitan
areas with rapidly growing populations, severe highway
congestion, and travel distances that are really too short to
fly and an often unpleasantly long drive.
Think about these numbers. Dallas-Fort Worth to San Antonio
is 310 rail-miles; San Antonio to Houston is 210 rail-miles;
Houston back up to Dallas-Fort Worth is 297 rail-miles. There
is only one rail trip to Austin, Texas, from Dallas, and that
is the Texas Eagle, and it takes 6\1/2\ hours, and that is if
it's on time when it leaves. And believe it or not, there is
even less passenger rail service on the other two legs of the
triangle.
Developing the intercity passenger rail service for the
Texas Triangle is going to require cooperation and financial
support at all levels of Government: Federal, State, and local.
And I am pleased that TxDOT and other Texas leaders are seizing
that opportunity. I fully support TxDOT's recent application
under the Federal Railroad Administration's Corridor
Identification and Development Program to lay the groundwork
for improved intercity passenger rail on the Texas Triangle.
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, thank you all very much for
giving me the opportunity to talk about the value I think that
could be obtained.
[Mr. Watson's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Kirk Watson, Mayor, City of Austin, Texas
Introduction
Chair Nehls, Ranking Member Payne, Chair Graves, Ranking Member
Larsen, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity
to testify.
I am pleased that the Subcommittee is holding this hearing. It is
certainly timely. We are now just over two years into the five years of
surface transportation investments authorized and appropriated by the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), including record levels
of federal investment in intercity passenger rail.
At the broadest level, I am eager to do anything I can to support
improved intercity passenger rail in Texas. Texas and its cities are
leading the nation in growth, and we desperately need to improve
multimodal mobility between the cities and metropolitan areas that are
the bedrock of our state's thriving economy.
When Austin's tiny Amtrak station was built in 1947, Austin's
population was just over 100,000. Today, our population is nearly a
million, making Austin the tenth largest city in the United States.
Austin has been the fastest growing metropolitan area since 2010; its
metropolitan area population now exceeds 2.4 million. Other Texas
cities and metropolitan areas are experiencing similarly robust growth.
Austin is carrying out a multibillion-dollar investment in
transportation infrastructure, including in our rapidly growing airport
and, working with TXDOT and Texas local governments, we are investing
tens of billions of dollars more in highways, local roads, and transit
such as a voter approved rail system. However, at the end of the day,
the laws of physics make it a simple fact that the highways and
airports connecting Texas cities cannot keep up with the demands of our
state's economy and the mobility needs of its people.
That is why I am glad federal agencies, Amtrak, TXDOT, and Texas
cities and counties are looking to improve intercity passenger rail
service in Texas, and more specifically on the Texas Triangle. These
potential investments will provide an attractive and convenient option
for travel between Texas cities. Just as or even more importantly, I
firmly believe they will lay the foundation for future service
expansion and improvements.
My testimony focuses on six primary topics:

IIJA's intercity passenger rail investments;

National and state plans for improving intercity
passenger rail;

The need to invest in a multimodal transportation system
connecting the cities of the Texas Triangle;

TXDOT and local government efforts to leverage items 2
and 3 above;

The importance of intercity passenger rail on-time
performance; and

The impact of the pandemic on transportation, how we can
adapt, and the lessons it provides.
IIJA Intercity Passenger Rail Investments
As this Subcommittee knows, the IIJA authorizes and appropriates
record levels of federal investment in intercity passenger rail. IIJA
authorizes $137 billion for intercity passenger rail programs and
provides advance fiscal years 2022-2026 appropriations of $66 billion
for those programs, a 140% increase over funding provided under the
FAST Act. In addition, Congress has provided regular, annual
appropriations for many of those programs, which I hope you will
continue to do in the coming years. Investments in intercity passenger
rail are also eligible under several of IIJA's other surface
transportation grant programs. Altogether, these investments provide a
window of opportunity for Amtrak, other intercity passenger rail
providers, and state and local governments to improve intercity
passenger rail in the coming years.
The $66 billion that IIJA appropriates for rail is more than the
total federal funding provided for Amtrak over the past 52 years. (For
those people who are quick to point out Amtrak's faults but shy to
offer solutions: at the end of the day, you get the transportation
system you pay for, in terms of both mode share and quality.)
Of that $66 billion, $22 billion is for Amtrak to focus on
improving and upgrading Amtrak's assets and $44 billion will flow
through Federal Railroad Administration discretionary grant programs.
The $22 billion for Amtrak to modernize their assets (fleet,
accessibility, infrastructure state of good repair, major stations)
will:

Modernize stations, enhancing the customer experience
with improved design, technology, and connections to other
transportation services,

Replace and repair infrastructure such as bridges,
tunnels, and facilities, many that are over a century old to better
support Amtrak, commuter, and freight service,

Buy new rolling stock to replace all of Amtrak's 20th
Century equipment and accommodate improved and expanded service,
including locomotives and passenger cars (which are also an investment
in American-made equipment, and helping the country grow more well-
paying jobs).

The $66 billion will allow Amtrak, states, and local governments to
make investments that will improve both intercity passenger rail and
freight rail.
In short, Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Administration will be
spending a lot of money on infrastructure improvements, facility
improvements, and new rolling stock in the coming years. As the Mayor
of Austin and a resident of the Texas Triangle, I want some of that
money to be spent on Texas tracks and Texas stations, and I want some
of those shiny new trains running in Texas and providing Texans with a
much-needed and long-overdue mobility option.
National & State Plans for Intercity Passenger Rail Improvements
So I am pleased that in the wake of the enactment of IIJA, there
are exciting plans at the federal and state level to improve intercity
passenger rail. As I look at these plans, I am not only convinced that
our nation and Texas should make these investments, but that we cannot
afford to miss this opportunity.
I am especially interested in the successful model implemented by
states such as California, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, and
Virginia to leverage federal, state, and local funds to improve
intercity passenger rail service on corridors that are in the ``sweet
spot'' for intercity passenger rail service. In general, those
corridors serve densely populated areas and connect cities less than
500 miles apart.
Investments in corridors like these in the nation's most densely
populated areas have the potential to:

Create redundancy in regional transportation systems,
relieving stress on overburdened airports and highways, and providing
the traveling public with an alternative to flying or driving,
especially for those people who are unable or simply prefer not to
drive

Meet latent and growing demand for intercity passenger
rail travel, especially among the young adults and seniors who often
prefer rail travel,

Improve mobility,

Reduce car crashes and the accompanying injuries and
fatalities, and

Increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions.

Experience shows that investment in regional intercity passenger
rail corridors pays dividends because they address the basic math and
physics problem facing regional mobility in the nation's megaregions,
where airports and highways are struggling to meet current demand, much
less future growth.
Compiling and combining quotes from several recent studies:

``While our infrastructure may be standing still, traffic has
continued to grow. Travel on the nation's Interstate highways
is increasing at a rate nearly triple the rate that new lane
capacity is being added. Between the turn of the century and
2016, total highway vehicle miles traveled (VMT) have increased
more than 15%. That means the frustrating congestion drivers
experience on urban interstates today, where 47% of highway
miles are congested during peak periods, will become the norm
between major cities as well. The increases are heavily
concentrated in urban areas, where VMTs grew more than 33%
between 2000 and 2016, further straining the transportation
infrastructure at the point where capacity increases were most
limited.\1\ The Federal Highway Administration projects that
vehicle miles traveled on U.S. highways will increase 22% above
2019 levels by 2037 an increase that will translate into
greater emissions and higher costs to consumers--who will
derive no corresponding benefit from sitting in traffic. While
autonomous vehicles are on the horizon, they're unlikely to
have a material impact on highway congestion in a world where
travel demand continues to grow, and additional road capacity
is limited. Amtrak will continue to study and review this
topic.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the aviation sector, the picture of projected growth
combined with static or falling capacity is very similar. The
Federal Aviation Administration projects that the number of
domestic airline passengers will grow 56% above 2019 levels by
2048.\2\ However, although domestic air travel has been growing
overall, the number of short-distance flights has fallen. There
are fewer passengers and fewer flights in most short distance
city pairs due to the unfavorable economics of short distance
flights and the disproportionate impact of enhanced security
screening and other delays on shorter trips.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A study by aircraft manufacturer Bombardier found that air
passenger trips in city pairs separated by fewer than 500 miles
fell 30% from 2000 to 2016. By contrast, when offered frequent,
efficient rail service, travelers have shown they prefer it.
During the 2000-2015 period, ridership on Amtrak's state-
supported short distance trains increased 70%. During 2019,
Amtrak carried more than three times as many riders between
Washington, DC, and New York City than all of the airlines
combined, and Amtrak carried more riders between New York City
and Boston than all of the airlines combined. Continued
capacity constraints and delays are likely to accelerate this
trend, resulting in less air service and higher airfares in
short-distance markets.'' \3\

I am especially impressed with the investments that Virginia, North
Carolina, and the states of the upper Midwest have made over the past
15 years to improve intercity passenger rail service along heavily
traveled corridors that, like the Texas Triangle, have rapidly growing
populations and congested interstate highways with no room to
accommodate projected future growth.
Looking to Virginia, the investments started under a Republican
Governor and continued by his Democratic and Republican successors to
improve intercity passenger rail travel have paid big dividends. These
investments extended the reach of the Northeast Corridor to additional
cities, increased frequencies, and reduced travel times. As a result,
ridership on state-supported corridors in Virginia has more than
tripled over the past decade.\4\ The same thing has happened in North
Carolina: ridership on its Charlotte-to-Raleigh Piedmont route has
increased nearly 350% in the past 15 years due to investments made
during the administrations of both Republican and Democratic governors,
and has broken ridership records in the past year.\5\ Just as
importantly, these state investments made with bipartisan support have
attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants and laid
the groundwork for additional investments that will further increase
service and reliability and drive additional ridership and economic
growth.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
My hope is that Texas can use these models to leverage IIJA to
improve intercity passenger rail service between communities along the
Texas Triangle.
Beyond domestic comparisons, looking to intercity passenger rail
service between the major Texas cities and those of Germany or another
Western European country further bolster the case for investment in the
Texas Triangle and other similar corridors.
Across Europe, nearly $1 trillion has been invested in rail since
2000 and Germany spends about 4 times as much as the US annually on
intercity passenger rail. Again, at the end of the day, you get the
transportation system you pay for, in terms of both mode share and
quality.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ 2000-2019 data from ``Data Analysis: Trains remain underfunded
in Europe,'' Investigate Europe, 19 Nov 2021, https://www.investigate-
europe.eu/en/2021/despite-public-support-for-rail-trains-remain-
underfunded-in-europe/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Germany is Europe's largest rail system in terms of annual
passengers. While the nation is roughly half the size of Texas, and its
population of 83 million is barely a quarter of the U.S. population,
its total network size is equal to Amtrak's but with 5 times as many
trips, 151 million in 2019.

Germany has strategically developed high-speed segments
to speed up certain city pair and international routes, while investing
in what are called ``conventional'' routes--or trains that are
typically moving at around 80-100 mph--to bring them up to 100 to 150
mph standards, achieving overall trip times competitive with driving
and flying.
+  Only 6% of Deutsche Bahn's network operates at speeds above
155 mph, yet the network serves as the primary mode of intercity travel
for many because it is a comprehensive, integrated, and convenient
travel network.

The example of Germany also easily counters perhaps the laziest and
most poorly thought-out argument against improving intercity passenger
rail in our nation: that we are too large and spread out for intercity
passenger rail to be successful. As outlined in the comparison of
Germany to Texas, that argument misses the point that 70% of Americans
live in 11 `megaregions' with dozens of city pairs that all have room
for improved intercity passenger rail as part of a balanced, multimodal
regional transportation system.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/
public/documents/corporate/reports/Amtrak-2021-Corridor-Vision-
060121.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Germany also illustrates that while investments in high-speed rail
are important, especially in corridors that meet the criteria for it to
succeed, investments in conventional-speed intercity passenger rail can
also pay big economic, mobility, and quality-of-life dividends. In
addition, they can be a steppingstone or building block toward high-
speed rail while providing mobility improvements and economic benefits
in the meantime.
While much of my testimony is focused on improving regional
corridor service, I want to convey that I am fully supportive of
Amtrak's long-distance network, and not just because it is the only
service we now have in Austin (only for the time being I hope). I also
support it because it helps bind our nation together and provides an
invaluable transportation service to hundreds of small communities
throughout our nation that, absent Amtrak long-distance service, would
have no other non-automobile connection to the rest of the country.
Meeting national goals such as improving mobility for smalltown America
is one of the main reasons we have a federal government, and it is
entirely appropriate for the federal government to support Amtrak's
long-distance network. That is why Amtrak's long-distance service
enjoys such strong support from local elected officials of all
political stripes across the nation. I also strongly believe that
investments in these megaregion corridors can complement and bolster
the long-distance services that are so important to hundreds of
communities throughout our nation.
The Texas Triangle
The three transportation corridors anchored by Dallas/Fort Worth,
Houston and San Antonio are often referred to as the ``Texas
Triangle.''
The Texas Triangle certainly fits the bill for improved intercity
passenger rail service. Indeed, I would argue that it is the lowest
hanging fruit in the nation for improving intercity passenger rail
service. That is why I am glad that federal agencies, Amtrak, and TXDOT
are looking at intercity passenger rail investments in the Texas
Triangle. They will provide an attractive and convenient option for
travel between Texas cities. Just as importantly, I firmly believe it
will lay the foundation for future service expansion and improvements.
Preliminary projections show that developing passenger rail service
in the Texas Triangle will produce robust ridership in return for
relatively modest capital investments. Given the population, population
density, economy, and demographics of the Texas Triangle, that really
should not come as a surprise. Even without such formal projections,
the need for improved intercity passenger rail in the Texas Triangle is
self-evident, and I would argue dire. The only political question is
the question of political will. This should not be a partisan issue,
and I hope that it will not be.
The Texas Triangle is home to 21 million people, 70% of all Texans,
and is experiencing rapid population growth, accounting for 88% of
Texas population growth between 2010 and 2020 \8\. The region is
expected to continue to grow rapidly in the coming years and decades.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Austin (1 million people), Dallas (1.3 million people),
Houston (2.3 million people), Fort Worth (956,709 people), and San
Antonio (1.4 million people) are all among the 15 largest cities in the
nation by population \9\.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ All population figures are from the United States Census
Bureau.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington Metropolitan Statistical
Area (7.9 million people) and the Houston-Pasadena-The Woodlands
Metropolitan Statistical Area (7.3 million people) are the 4th and 5th
largest metropolitan areas in the nation, with the San Antonio-New
Braunfels Metropolitan Statistical Area (2.6 million people) and the
Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos Metropolitan Statistical Area (2.4 million
people) ranked 24th and 27th.

All of these metropolitan areas are among the fastest growing
metropolitan areas in the nation, accounting for the bulk of Texas'
population growth. Indeed, the cities and metropolitan areas of the
major Texas cities stand out among the nation's 175 metropolitan
statistical areas for growth. Among metropolitan statistical areas, for
the two-year period ending last year:

The Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos Metropolitan Statistical
Area grew by 6%, 16th fastest in the nation,

The Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington Metropolitan Statistical
Area grew by 4%, the 50th fastest rate in the nation,

The San Antonio-New Braunfels Metropolitan Statistical
Area grew by 3.8%, the 53rd fastest rate in the nation, and

The Houston-Pasadena-The Woodlands Metropolitan
Statistical Area grew by 3%, the 71st fastest rate in the nation.

To provide more context for population growth in our state's larger
regions, note that U.S. population growth during this two-year period
was 0.7 percent.
Beyond its five `top 13' cities and their metropolitan areas, the
other cities and metropolitan areas located on the Texas Triangle make
it an even more obvious choice for investments in improved intercity
passenger rail. Indeed, in many states, those cities and their
metropolitan areas would be their state's largest and most dominant.
They all provide a strong population base for ridership along with
institutions, such as universities, military bases, and health care
facilities that would be natural trip generators for improved intercity
passenger rail service.
In addition, all those metropolitan areas are also experiencing
impressive population growth. For the two-year period ending last year:

The Killeen-Temple Metropolitan Statistical Area
(496,228) grew by 4.4%, the 39th fastest rate in the nation,

The College Station-Bryan Metropolitan Statistical Area
(277,824) grew by 3.5%, the 57th fastest rate in the nation, and

The Waco Metropolitan Statistical Area (302,582) grew by
2.3%, the 92nd fastest rate in the nation.

The Texas Triangle is also one of the most economically dynamic and
vibrant regions in the nation. Over the past decades, we have
diversified and grown our economy and attracted new employers from
throughout the nation and the world. According to The U.S. Conference
of Mayors most recent US Metro Economies report \10\, Texas
metropolitan areas account for 88.9% of the Texas economy. The cities
and metropolitan areas of the Texas Triangle account for 74.2% of the
Texas economy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The icing on the cake of the argument for investing in improved
intercity passenger rail service is that all this population and
economic activity--again 70% of all Texans and 74.2% of the Texas
economy--is concentrated along the three corridors of the Texas
Triangle that most experts agree are the ideal distance for intercity
passenger rail.
Austin is located along the western leg of the Triangle that links
San Antonio, Austin, Fort Worth and Dallas. Those four cities along the
310-mile western leg are all among the 13 largest cities in the United
States, with an additional 800,000 people living along that leg in Waco
and Killeen-Temple. By contrast, only two of the 13 largest U.S.
cities--New York City and Philadelphia--are located along the Boston-
to-Washington Northeast Corridor.
As noted above, one of the benefits of intercity passenger rail is
its ability to connect a wide range of destinations. Improving
intercity passenger rail service on the Texas Triangle will not just
improve mobility between major cities, it will improve mobility for
every town with a station. People traveling between Dallas and Houston
or Austin and San Antonio will certainly benefit, but people traveling
from College Station to Fort Worth, from Waco to Dallas, or from Temple
to San Antonio will also benefit.
Austin's only interstate highway, Interstate 35 runs along the San
Antonio to Dallas/Fort Worth Corridor. The portion of I-35 through
Austin is one of the most congested highways in Texas. Austin-Bergstrom
International Airport handled over 21 million passengers last year.
That's nearly double the number in 1999, the year the airport opened.
Each day, there are 80 airline flights along the San Antonio to Dallas/
Fort Worth Corridor. Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, a less than 200-mile
flight from Austin, is the most popular air destination from both the
Austin and San Antonio airports. There aren't any flights between
Austin and San Antonio because the distance is too short.
The San Antonio to Dallas/Fort Worth Corridor has all the
attributes that drive demand for passenger rail service--four major
metropolitan areas with large and rapidly growing populations, severe
highway congestion, and travel distances that are too short to fly and
an often unpleasantly long drive. The distance from Austin to Dallas is
nearly identical to the distance from Washington to New York City. But
while travelers between Washington and New York City can choose from 30
trains a day, including Acelas that make the trip in less than three
hours, there is only one train from Dallas to Austin, the Texas Eagle.
The Texas Eagle is a long-distance train that begins in Chicago and
ends in San Antonio. It takes more than six and a half hours to travel
the 230 miles from Dallas to Austin. That's if it's on time--the Texas
Eagle, which travels over 1,300 miles on freight railroad lines before
it gets to Austin, is often late. And although the Texas Eagle stops in
downtown Austin just a few blocks from Sixth Street, the entertainment
district that has made Austin the Live Music Capital of the World and
draws millions of visitors a year, most Austin residents don't even
know that there's a train serving their city. Last year, Austin's
Amtrak station handled fewer than 33,000 passengers.
Believe it or not, there is even less passenger rail service on the
other two legs of the Texas Triangle. From San Antonio to Houston,
there is a single long-distance train that operates just three times a
week. And between Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth, the fourth and fifth
largest metropolitan areas in the United States, there is not any
Amtrak service at all. (Train advocates will often post on social media
that every flight between city pairs such as these is a policy failure.
It may be easy to mock these statements as hyperbole, but a little
reflection can only lead to the conclusion that they have a point.)
We can do better. Every other nation in the world approaching our
GDP (and indeed many that are not even close to our GDP) has invested
in their intercity passenger rail system, in many cases to the point
that it is the preferred or even default method of traveling between
cities that are less than 500 miles apart. Even in the United States,
in the places where we have made half-hearted upgrades to legacy
systems, most notably the Northeast Corridor, intercity passenger rail
accounts for a major share of the intercity mode share, even though
those investments lag well behind those of our peer nations.
For the more than thirty million residents of Texas, the nation's
second largest state, they need and deserve more passenger rail
service. Our population is now growing much faster than the rest of the
country and is projected to continue at this pace. In fact, the
population of the Austin Metropolitan Area is expected to nearly double
by 2060. Texas's overcrowded highways and many of its airports are
unable to handle current travel demand, let alone the enormous
increases in travel that increased population will produce. Adding
enough new highway lanes to accommodate all the people who will need to
travel isn't even feasible, let alone desirable. There is no reason why
Austin and the rest of Texas shouldn't have the benefits that passenger
rail service provides in other regions of the country.
TXDOT and Local Government Efforts
Developing the intercity passenger rail service for the Texas
Triangle will require cooperation between and financial support from
federal, state, and local governments. I do not doubt that our nation
and our state have the resources to implement this plan. I just hope
that we have the political will to do so.
On both fronts, I am pleased that the Texas Department of
Transportation (TXDOT) and other Texas leaders have worked in a
bipartisan and intergovernmental manner to seize the opportunity
presented by IIJA to lay the groundwork for improved intercity
passenger rail service between Texas cities.
I fully support TXDOT's recent applications under the Federal
Railroad Administration's Corridor Identification and Development
(Corridor ID) Plan to lay the groundwork for improved intercity
passenger rail on the Texas Triangle. In addition to TXDOT's efforts to
leverage IIJA's historic levels of investment in intercity passenger
rail and Amtrak's vision for the Texas Triangle, I also appreciate
their partnership with local governments on this issue. I look forward
to continuing to work with the Federal Railroad Administration, Amtrak,
and TXDOT in a bipartisan and intergovernmental manner to support
intercity passenger rail investments that improve mobility and support
our state's economy.
At the local level, Texas local elected officials have taken
several steps to support Amtrak and TXDOT's vision for the Texas
Triangle. In June, I had the opportunity to meet with Amtrak CEO
Stephen Gardner and his team. Later this past summer, Travis County
Judge Andy Brown and I gathered a bipartisan group of local elected
leaders from along the Austin-San Antonio corridor to discuss Amtrak's
thinking and gain input. We invited Texas County Judges, County
Commissioners and other officials attending the Convention of the
National Association of Counties that was held in Austin. Presentations
were made, including by Amtrak.
On-Time Performance
I know that this Subcommittee has spent a considerable amount of
time on the issue of the on-time performance of intercity passenger
trains and how it can best be addressed by statute, by regulation, and
by everyday operating practices, and that there has been robust debate
on it. I am not an expert on this issue, but I would be remiss if I did
not address it in my testimony.
At the most basic level, intercity passenger trains must
demonstrate reliable on-time service to fully meet their potential as
part of a multimodal regional transportation system. This is especially
important in communities with infrequent service or trains that are
scheduled to arrive and depart overnight.
Unfortunately, the Texas Eagle, the long-distance train that serves
Austin, has what can only be described as dismal on-time performance.
This situation is largely a product of forces beyond Amtrak's control.
Outside of the Northeast Corridor, the on-time performance of Amtrak
intercity passenger trains relies on the state of good repair and
cooperation of freight railroad hosting those trains.
I appreciate the importance of our freight rail network to our
economy. However, experience in other nations and indeed here in the
United States shows that intercity passenger trains can run on time
without unduly impacting freight operations. As Amtrak CEO Stephen
Gardner told the nation's mayors at The U.S. Conference of Mayors
Annual Meeting this past June, Amtrak's Empire Builder and Hiawatha
services running on Canadian Pacific tracks boast enviable on-time
service. As Mr. Gardner said to us:

``We have the largest rail network in the world, more than
50,000 miles more than the 2nd place network--China. We believe
we can and should do more to with this incredible network so
that it serves both people and freight better.''

I support Amtrak's efforts to address on-time performance via
existing statutes and regulations via proceedings at the Surface
Transportation Board, and I encourage this Subcommittee to similarly
support Amtrak on-time performance. The good news is that the
investments unleashed by IIJA have the potential to improve the
reliability and efficiency of both passenger and freight rail if we do
them correctly.
I would conclude this section by noting that even with only one
train per day in each direction that almost always runs behind
schedule, ridership at Austin's Amtrak station increased by 11.19% in
FY 2023 over FY 2022. Imagine our ridership numbers if we had several
trains per day that ran on time.
The Impact of the Pandemic on Transportation, How We Can Adapt, and the
Lessons It Provides
This is perhaps the trickiest part of my testimony because I am not
sure that I or any person has fully absorbed the impacts of the
pandemic on transportation, nor fully developed a plan to address the
lessons it provided.
However, one clear lesson is the need for redundancy and resilience
in all our systems, including transportation.
Another lesson is to remain focused on the long-term and not let
current headlines, especially alarmist ones, lead to rash decisions.
Two years ago, we were told that cities are dead, downtowns especially
so, and that the nation's white collar work force had permanently
decamped to the exurbs, the mountains, and the beach, never again to be
seen in cities and metropolitan areas. Well, it turns out that cities
and downtowns are pretty resilient places, and that foot traffic and
activity is has come back strong. That said, a lot of this new activity
is not necessarily focused on office workers, many of whom will likely
continue to work remotely, at least a few days a week.
In cities, that means we may have to continue to refocus our
transportation system away from rush hour to more multimodal streets
that better accommodate residents and intra-neighborhood travel, and,
given the increase in remote shopping, better accommodate delivery
vehicles. Regionally, it almost certainly means that there will be
increased demand for regional intercity travel.
As outlined above, pandemic or not, the Texas Triangle is primed
for increased and improved regional intercity passenger rail service.
The seeming permanence of remote work, at least for some days of the
week, likely means even more demand for increased and improved regional
intercity passenger rail service. I envy those regions in our nation
that already have a strong baseline from which to increase and improve
regional intercity passenger rail service and am eager for my region to
catch up.
Returning to earlier statements about math, physics, and comparison
to Europe, our economy is making demands on our regional mobility
system that are driven by population growth, economic growth, and
demographic changes. At the end of the day, we cannot expand our
airport capacity soon enough. We all witnessed our overburdened
airports last week. It led the news coverage in nearly every market. It
is easy to make fun of breathless media coverage of Thanksgiving travel
woes, but there is no question that there was plenty of agony there
this Thanksgiving holiday, with more to come.
But intercity rail is an option in the near term, with significant
potential to add new travel capacity at less cost. As stated above,
there is strong latent demand for it, and it is an untapped resource.
Let me illustrate this untapped capacity.
Austin is one of the fastest growing cities and metropolitan areas
in the nation, driven by several factors but mostly due to our
emergence as one of the nation's top technology centers. I looked at
comparable technology areas in Europe for a comparison. The Amsterdam
Metropolitan Area is nearly identical in population to the Austin
region. Amsterdam's Central station serves nearly 200,000 passengers
daily on 22 domestic routes and 8 international ones, with hundreds of
daily trains. And, it is not even the busiest station in Holland.
Austin will certainly never be Amsterdam, nor Texas the
Netherlands, but it is also true that we have the potential to serve
many more people in Texas with expanded intercity passenger rail
offerings to meet their travel needs.
Conclusion
The rural Texas of myth and popular imagination is a Texas I love.
It is a core part of our history, culture, and identity. However, the
Texas of 2023 is an urban and suburban state with a diverse, modern
economy centered on the Texas Triangle. As an elected official, I am
duty bound to focus on the mobility needs of the real-world Texas of
2023 and beyond.
That is why I am pleased that IIJA provides historic levels of
investment in intercity passenger rail, that federal agencies, TXDOT,
and Amtrak are looking at investments in the Texas Triangle, that the
Federal Railroad Administration is moving forward with its Corridor ID
Program, and that state and local officials in Texas are working
together to leverage both to finally bring increased and improved
intercity passenger rail to the Texas Triangle. If we can work in a
bipartisan, intergovernmental manner and succeed, we will provide
immediate benefits to Texans and the Texas economy. Just as or even
more importantly, I firmly believe it will lay the foundation for
future service expansion and improvements that will allow our state and
its cities and metropolitan areas to be one of the most dynamic and
successful places in the nation and the world.
In closing, I would be remiss if in addition to thanking the
Subcommittee, I did not thank USDOT and the Federal Railroad
Administration, Amtrak, TXDOT, other Texas state and local officials,
and Texas Rail Advocates and other citizens working in support of
improved intercity passenger rail service in Texas.
Thank you again for this opportunity to testify and for your
attention to and work on this important issue.

Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mayor Watson. Thank you all, all
four, for your testimony.
I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a
statement from Ian Jefferies, president and CEO of the
Association of American Railroads, dated November 29, 2023.
Without objection, so ordered.
[The information follows:]

Statement of Ian Jefferies, President and Chief Executive Officer,
Association of American Railroads, Submitted for the Record by Hon.
Troy E. Nehls
Introduction
On behalf of the members of the Association of American Railroads
(AAR), thank you for the opportunity to submit this statement for the
record.
AAR's freight railroad members, which include the six major U.S.
Class I railroads plus several regional railroads and short line
railroad holding companies, account for approximately 85 percent of the
line-haul mileage, 93 percent of the employees, and 98 percent of the
revenues of all freight railroads in the United States.
The U.S. freight rail system is the best in the world. America's
freight railroads--the overwhelming majority of which are privately
owned--operate almost exclusively on infrastructure they own, build,
maintain, and pay for themselves. Over the last 15 years, freight
railroads have invested, on average, more than $24 billion of their own
capital each year into improving and maintaining their networks. To put
this in perspective, that is $1 billion more than the historic
investments Congress made in rail and multimodal programs in the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). America's manufacturers,
retailers, miners, farmers, and others all rely on America's best-in-
the-world freight railroads to succeed in the intensely competitive
global marketplace.
Amtrak is also a member of AAR, as are several commuter railroads
that account for more than 70 percent of U.S. commuter rail trips.
Passenger railroads play a key role in alleviating highway and airport
congestion, decreasing dependence on foreign oil, reducing pollution,
and enhancing mobility.
America can, and should, have a safe, efficient passenger rail
network and a safe, productive freight rail system. Mutual success for
passenger and freight railroads requires cooperation between
stakeholders and recognition of the challenges that railroads face.
Policymakers should continue to balance the country's need to move both
people and goods safely and efficiently.
Freight and Passenger Rail Partnerships: Decades in the Making
Well into the 20th century, railroads were the primary means to
transport people and freight throughout the United States. However, by
the late 1950s, the dramatic expansion of America's highway system and
the development of commercial aviation meant private railroads were
losing $750 million annually (around $5.9 billion in today's dollars)
on passenger service.\1\ At the time, a noted transportation scholar
wrote,``[I]t is no exaggeration to say that by 1958 railroad passenger
service had demonstrated itself to be the most uneconomic activity ever
carried on by private firms for a prolonged period.'' \2\ These massive
losses continued for many years largely because government regulators
made it extremely difficult for railroads to discontinue unprofitable
passenger rail service. The losses drained a rail system that was also
facing unrelenting pressure on its freight side from subsidized trucks
and barges.

Deficit, Report Proposed by Howard Hosmer, Hearing Examiner, Assisted
by Robert A. Berrien, Fred A. Christoph, and Raymond C. Smith, attorney
advisers,'' Docket No. 31954, 1958.
\2\ George W. Hilton, The Transportation Act of 1958, Indiana
University Press, 1969, p. 13.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 1970, Congress passed, and President Richard Nixon signed into
law, the Rail Passenger Service Act (RPSA), which created Amtrak. The
RPSA was a response to the real possibility that the United States
would soon have no intercity rail passenger service at all and a
recognition that financial losses from rail passenger service were a
serious threat to the viability of freight railroading.
Given the huge financial drain of passenger rail, railroads
generally welcomed the opportunity to exit the business and provided
the backbone of the newly-formed Amtrak system. Freight railroads
initially helped capitalize Amtrak by providing cash, equipment, and
services; these payments to Amtrak totaled around $1.2 billion in
today's dollars. Freight railroads were also required to provide
preference to Amtrak service on their lines. That requirement exists to
this day. In turn, Amtrak was required to pay only incremental costs
when operating on a host railroad's tracks, with no requirement to
support capital investment for improving and expanding infrastructure
capacity.\3\ Amtrak's low track usage fees remain a major indirect
subsidy provided by freight railroads to Amtrak.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ Provisions in agreements between Amtrak and freight railroads
(discussed below) pertaining to financial incentives related to
performance can also count as being compensatory to the host freight
railroad.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Freight railroads still provide the infrastructure for most
passenger rail. Amtrak owns around 623 route-miles (primarily in the
Northeast) and operates, maintains, and dispatches another 229 route-
miles in Michigan and New York. The vast majority of Amtrak's remaining
21,400-mile system operates on tracks owned and maintained by freight
railroads. More than 70 percent of the miles traveled by Amtrak trains
are on tracks owned by others, primarily freight railroads.
In addition, approximately half of the nation's commuter rail
systems also operate at least partially on tracks owned by freight
railroads, and most of the higher speed and intercity passenger rail
projects under consideration nationwide rely on freight railroad-owned
facilities.
Commuter railroads do not enjoy the same automatic preferential
treatment and automatic access to freight rail tracks as Amtrak. Before
operating on freight-owned property, commuter railroads must reach a
voluntary agreement with the host freight railroad governing the
relationship, including hours of operation, access and number of
trains. These partnerships have led to significant growth in commuter
rail, which increased from around six commuter rail systems 40 years
ago to close to 30 systems today.
Principles to Guide Passenger Rail Operations on Freight-Owned
Corridors
While each project involving passenger and freight railroads should
be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, certain overarching principles
must be followed to ensure both the long-term success of passenger rail
and a healthy freight rail system that shippers all over the country
can rely on every day.
First and foremost, safety must be a priority. Railroads are an
extremely safe way to move people and freight. Freight railroads invest
in advanced technologies, employee training, effective operational
strategies, and community engagement to maximize the safety of their
networks. These investments have led to a safety record of which the
railroads are proud. The train accident rate in 2022 was down 23
percent from 2000, and the employee injury rate was down 47 percent.
Passenger rail projects must likewise be designed and executed around
safety as the first priority.
Second, current and future capacity needs of both freight and
passenger railroads must be properly protected. Today, freight
railroads carry far more freight on far fewer miles of track than they
did when Amtrak was created. This volume growth is the result of
significant investments--on average more than $24 billion per year over
the last 15 years--freight railroads have made in their networks.
Despite these massive investments, rail capacity is not unlimited. In
fact, in some places, it is tightly constrained. Plans to expand
passenger railroad use within freight rail corridors must be balanced
with the need to provide safe, reliable, and cost-effective freight
service to present and future customers.
To ensure this balance, host freight railroads must be part of the
planning process for new or expanded passenger services from the very
beginning. This principle is especially important when considering
programs to plan new intercity passenger rail corridors, like the
Corridor Identification and Development Program (CIDP) created by the
IIJA. Congress recognized the importance of including freight railroads
in the process and stipulated that consultation with host railroads be
considered when awarding grants under CIDP. In subsequent notifications
about the program, however, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
did not include consultation with host railroads in its initial plans.
Thankfully, through productive conversations with the FRA, freight
railroads expect to be more involved in the planning and development of
these new corridors going forward, ensuring that the program works for
freight and passenger railroads and the communities they serve.
Third, proper funding is necessary, especially as Amtrak looks to
improve or expand service offerings. The process of expanding existing
passenger service, or improving existing passenger service reliability,
is complex and requires detailed planning and significant additional
infrastructure capacity investment. Freight railroads should not be
expected to bear the costs of building and maintaining new
infrastructure upgrades necessary to accommodate additional passenger
trains.
Nor is it reasonable to expect Amtrak to plan, build, and maintain
a network that provides optimal transportation mobility and
connectivity when it faces excessive uncertainty regarding its funding
from one year to the next. The IIJA includes $66 billion in rail
funding, the vast majority of which is for passenger rail and Amtrak.
This funding will go a long way to ensuring Amtrak can operate safely
and effectively. It is crucial that this funding be spent where it has
the biggest positive impact. Freight railroads are committed to working
with Amtrak, state agencies, government officials, and others to meet
that goal.
Fourth, all parties must recognize that the preference given to
Amtrak's trains over freight trains does not mean delays to Amtrak
trains will never happen. Just as traveling in an HOV highway lane does
not guarantee a motorist will not experience traffic, Amtrak could
experience delays due to weather, unexpectedly high freight volumes, or
other issues that are unavoidable and beyond the freight railroad's
reasonable control.
This is not an exhaustive list of principles that should be applied
to passenger rail projects. For example, liability and tax issues will
also come into play. However, as policymakers and stakeholders consider
the expansion and improvement of passenger rail service on freight
rail-owned infrastructure, these are the top priorities and issues that
must be kept in mind.
On-Time Performance (OTP) Metrics
Since its creation, Amtrak and freight railroads have worked
together to establish and implement the rules and procedures governing
how passenger and freight railroads interact. Most of these rules and
procedures are spelled out in formal bilateral operating agreements
negotiated between Amtrak and its host railroads. These agreements
often provide incentives and penalties for freight railroads to help
ensure Amtrak trains meet specified on-time targets. Operating
agreements that came into force years ago may be outdated and, in some
cases, no longer appropriate.
More specifically, some Amtrak long distance train schedules have
not been properly adjusted in response to the tremendous growth in the
U.S. economy and related freight volumes and other changes in the
railroad operating environment over the past decades. Outdated
schedules that do not properly account for changed conditions (e.g.,
seasonality, necessary track work, and ridership patterns or needs) can
result in misleading performance measurements or unrealistic
expectations for on-time performance.
AAR has long been a participant in the FRA's efforts to develop
appropriate metrics and standards for measuring Amtrak's performance.
This cooperative process was specifically envisioned in FRA's November
2020 final rule on metrics and minimum standards for measuring the
performance and service quality of intercity passenger train
operations. The rule established a customer OTP metric and customer OTP
standard, which are measured against published train schedules. The
rule also recognized that Amtrak's current schedules are not aligned
with the new metric or standard. FRA stated that, historically,
Amtrak's published train schedules have not been designed with a
customer OTP metric in mind, and that alignment may require additional
time as schedules will need to be adjusted.
While many schedules have since been aligned with the new customer
OTP metric, for those that are not, it is crucial that Amtrak, host
railroads, and other key stakeholders work in good faith to design
schedules that are realistic and achievable and resolve differences to
meet the shared goal of timely service based on achievable schedules.
The Surface Transportation Board (STB) likewise has a role to play in
investigating disputes over the on-time performance of passenger rail
service. It is imperative that schedules be properly aligned with the
metric prior to the initiation of an STB investigation, as ``accurate
schedules are an essential element'' in assessing on-time performance
matters.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ Comments of the STB, Metrics and Minimum Standards for
Intercity Passenger Rail Service, Docket No. FRA-2019-0069, at 3 (June
1, 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keeping Amtrak, commuter, and freight trains running on time is
tremendously complex. When Amtrak was created, freight railroads had
significant excess capacity. Since then, most of this excess capacity
has disappeared, and the freight rail industry has invested over $780
billion of its own money to maintain and add new capacity in response
to market needs. While additional capital investments may be necessary
to add passenger capacity, improving on-time performance will also
require appropriate Amtrak schedules. Freight railroads and Amtrak,
working together, are in the best position to determine how these
operating agreements should be structured and evolve over time.
The day-to-day reality of safely operating and maintaining freight
railroads' nearly 140,000-mile network can also impact OTP. For
example, freight railroads temporarily reduce operating speeds on
stretches of track when conditions, such as maintenance activities or
adverse weather events, call for it. These ``slow orders'' are
imperative for safety and can delay trains of all types, including
Amtrak trains. Similarly, necessary track and signal maintenance may
result in unavoidable, short-term delays for freight and passenger
trains but improves service reliability and enhances safety in the long
term. The application of OTP standards should not make it more
difficult or expensive for freight railroads to perform necessary
maintenance or take appropriate steps to ensure the safety of crews and
communities where they operate.
A one-size-fits-all solution will not work on a network as complex
and as crucial as our nation's rail system. Host railroads and Amtrak
must undertake periodic reviews of reasonable and realistic schedules
and of meaningful OTP metrics while complying with private, bilateral
contracts that consider the unique circumstances of particular routes.
Conclusion
Having safe, effective passenger railroads alongside safe,
productive freight railroads remains our shared goal. Freight railroads
look forward to working with policymakers and other stakeholders to
achieve it. I am confident that, together, freight railroads and Amtrak
can work together in ways that benefit all parties.

Mr. Nehls. We will now turn to questions for the panel. I
will recognize myself for 5 minutes.
Dr. Ohanian, the Biden administration's aspirations for
high-speed rail fail to account for several realities,
including the lack of customer demand, economic viability, and
the impact on existing rail infrastructure. So, how can
Congress best safeguard taxpayer dollars when considering
support for high-speed rail and other projects discussed today?
Mr. Ohanian. Chairman, important question and multiple
parts to that.
To conserve Federal funding, we should prioritize projects
on the basis of the amount of return that they can deliver to
Americans.
My testimony tried to provide sort of a four-step process
that could be a blueprint for evaluating these types of
projects and where they have gone wrong in the past,
particularly in California. The business plan has to be
detailed, and it really has to bring into account costs and
risks.
And fundamentally, what I see from where I sit as an
academic is just the riskiness of these projects has just been
so avoided. And that is something that really, I think, is to
the detriment of us as Americans.
Mr. Nehls. And in your testimony, you talk a little bit
about Brightline--is it the Vegas to California--and how that
private-public partnership and how Brightline can do it for
less cost. Explain that.
Mr. Ohanian. Yes, yes. So, Brightline is building a 228-
mile route from southern California to Las Vegas, at a
projected cost of nearly two-thirds less than California's
high-speed rail project. So, that is very striking because it
shows that it can be done much more economically, and it can be
done much more economically when the right incentives are in
place, which is, of course, what happens with the private
sector.
So, I think when it comes to high-speed rail, we have to
really temper the idea of finding the routes and segments where
there is sufficient demand, and finding routes where there is
relatively few risks, and where we can build it at a reasonable
cost.
Mr. Nehls. If the California high-speed rail project was
initiated as a true public-private partnership, where the
private sector would assume more of the financial risk in the
construction and operating of that system, how different would
things look today if the California high-speed rail----
Mr. Ohanian [interrupting]. Well, I suspect it would be
very different. You know, in the private sector one can't
imagine not delivering revenue for 15 years----
Mr. Nehls [interposing]. Yes, yes.
Mr. Ohanian [continuing]. And going over budget by a factor
of 4. It just boggles the mind.
Mr. Nehls. In your testimony, it talks about that plan, the
rail plan for California high-speed rail, and that was legally
required. And the plan wasn't out there, and then it went to
the bond, and the voters voted on it. Did anybody go to jail
for that?
Mr. Ohanian. I do not know.
Mr. Nehls. To me, they misled the voters.
Mr. Ohanian. In my opinion, yes.
Mr. Nehls. Yes. Thank you again for being here.
Ms. Mortensen, Texas is considering the development of
high-speed passenger rail service between Dallas and Houston.
What lessons can Texas and Federal policymakers learn from
California's high-speed rail experience?
Ms. Mortensen. Well, I think in the event we are working on
Class I rail lines, I think a lot of cooperation upfront and a
real business understanding of what the risks will be.
When we use someone else's right-of-way, we need to partner
and we need to respect that they have rights and assets that
they have built over time.
Where we are building outside of that right-of-way, I think
really understanding the risk that is involved in right-of-way,
and the optics of purchasing right-of-way that might sit for a
long period of time and may disrupt family industries that have
been around for generations.
And so, I think some of those risks may not have been at
the forefront, but those kind of things do need to be thought
about upfront and really mitigated before the process starts.
Mr. Nehls. Mayor Watson, I am on the record supporting
high-speed rail. I like the idea of that rail line between
Houston and Dallas. I see the congestion on I-45 and everything
else. How do you feel about that project and what do you know
about that project?
Mr. Watson. Well, I don't know as much as maybe I should
know about it, but what I do know is that I like the idea of
when you don't have anything in terms of rail going between
Dallas, that metroplex, and the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex,
and the Houston area metroplex, which are the fourth and fifth
largest metroplexes in the country, we need to have more there.
I also like the idea that there may be some competition
in--I think that is a good thing. But I agree that what is
going to be required is upfront collaboration, upfront
recognizing the risks and analyzing those completely, so that
people go into it trying to mitigate those risks as opposed to
learning about that after they start.
I think the opportunity that Amtrak also provides as part
of that is one that we ought to clearly look at because of what
could be done perhaps more rapidly.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. My time is expired. I now recognize
Ranking Member Payne for 5 minutes.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, Chairman Nehls. I would like to ask
unanimous consent to submit a letter from the States for
Passenger Rail Coalition addressed to the House and Senate
Appropriations Committees expressing deep concern regarding the
cuts proposed in the House's fiscal year 2024 THUD
appropriations bill and the drastic impact these cuts would
have on short-distance intercity rail.
Mr. Nehls. Without objection.

Letter of November 29, 2023, to Chairs and Ranking Members of the
Senate and House Appropriations Committees, from Jeremy Latimer, Chair,
States for Passenger Rail Coalition, Submitted for the Record by Hon.
Donald M. Payne, Jr.
November 29, 2023.
The Honorable Patty Murray,
Senate Appropriations Committee,
Chair, United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510.
The Honorable Susan Collins,
Senate Appropriations Committee,
Ranking Member, United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510.
The Honorable Kay Granger,
House Appropriations Committee,
Chair, United States House of Representatives, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Rosa DeLauro,
House Appropriations Committee,
Ranking Member, United States House of Representatives, Washington, DC
20515.
Dear Chair Murray, Ranking Member Collins, Chair Granger, and
Ranking Member DeLauro,
On behalf of the States for Passenger Rail Coalition (SPRC), which
represents 27 state departments of transportation and passenger rail
authorities across the U.S., we would like to thank you for your work
on the Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24) appropriations process and express our
support of funding for intercity passenger rail. We understand the
current fiscal challenges you face, and we greatly appreciate your
commitment to working on transportation funding.
SPRC members work closely with Amtrak on issues affecting Amtrak's
national long-distance service and the 29 state-supported Amtrak
routes. Sustained funding for Amtrak is necessary to not only maintain
current service but also enhance services to meet rising demand and the
needs of a modern transportation network. Through partnership with
Amtrak and the U.S. Department of Transportation, our state intercity
rail programs are the building blocks for the future of intercity
passenger rail in the United States.
We are grateful for the funding under the IIJA, which supports
overcoming a backlog of state of good repair and enabling expansion of
service. These are vital investments in America's transportation
economy. However, the funding levels contained in the House FY24 THUD
bill, H.R. 4820, would create additional burdens to SPRC members' state
transportation programs, affecting both state-supported Amtrak routes
and Amtrak long-distance services. Amtrak has stated that at these
funding levels, they would be forced to reduce or suspend service,
furlough employees, and defer critical capital projects.
According to Amtrak, the first 11 months of FY23, state-supported
routes contributed $782.4M toward Amtrak expenses:

$404.7M was in the form of ticket revenue from state-
supported trains

$377.7M was in the form of state payments to Amtrak.

With states already contributing significantly to Amtrak's budget,
the proposed federal funding cuts would disproportionately impact state
transportation budgets as they try to make up this delta and maintain
adequate service levels.
SPRC appreciates the challenges Congress faces, and we are grateful
to have leaders in Washington who support passenger rail. SPRC
respectfully asks Congress to ensure sufficient funding levels for
Amtrak services in the final FY24 budget to avoid national service
disruptions.
Sincerely,
Jeremy Latimer,
Chair, States for Passenger Rail Coalition,
Virginia Passenger Rail Authority.

Speaker Mike Johnson, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries

Mr. Payne. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Watson, once again, thank you for being here. And I
have recently seen articles about how the growth both in Austin
and San Antonio could lead to a mega-metro of sorts.
Mr. Watson. Yes.
Mr. Payne. How would an increase in intercity passenger
rail between these two cities impact the quality of life for
the residents in your region?
Mr. Watson. Well, I appreciate that question. I would say
two things.
First of all, for those that don't know, Austin and San
Antonio are only roughly 100 to 110 miles apart from each
other. And the only way, the only really straight way to do it,
to get there back and forth, is Interstate 35, which is the
only interstate highway that runs through Austin and San
Antonio, and it is very congested. That being said, I will give
two quick examples.
One is that we know that workforce goes back and forth
between our two cities. Both of those thriving economies of
Austin and San Antonio, they rely upon each other for
workforce. The numbers that we have indicate that about 20,000
people leave Bexar County every morning and go to Travis
County, which is Austin, and about 28,000 go the other
direction and work. So, in terms of work and careers and the
quality of life of people, it would make a difference.
Mr. Payne. Excellent. In your interactions with mayors from
smaller cities such as Temple and College Station, have they
expressed support for increased intercity passenger rail?
Mr. Watson. Yes. In fact, during the National Association
of Counties convention in Austin, we convened a group of
locally elected officials to talk about passenger rail, and
there is a lot of support because of the difference they see it
making for their people.
Mr. Payne. And how would these smaller communities benefit
from increased service?
Mr. Watson. Well, first of all, people can live in those
small communities and maybe work in other places. They also can
have quality of life issues in that they may be able to attend
and go to different things.
But the other part that I would indicate is it ties our
State and our country together, which is--one of the really
great roles of the Federal Government is making the kinds of
investments that keep us bound together and tie us together.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
Mr. Daly, thanks for being here today. The FRA program, the
Confidential Close Call Reporting System modeled after the
successful FAA initiative, allows rail workers to
confidentially report near misses, improving the safety of the
industry as a whole. Do you believe a program such as this
could improve both intercity passenger and freight rail in
terms of safety?
Mr. Daly. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question.
Yes, CSX has drafted our own Confidential Close Call
Reporting MOU. We have shared that with SMART and BLET, and I
have a meeting set up here hopefully within the next month with
the FRA also included in that discussion to see if that is
something that we can advance forward, independent of the
broader Class I AAR contingency.
Unfortunately, that is about the extent of my knowledge of
this. I can definitely have one of my colleagues that is more
well versed in this matter get with you after the hearing.
Mr. Payne. OK, thank you. I would be glad to hear what is
the holdup with CSX joining this program.
Chairman Nehls, I would like to ask unanimous consent to
submit a letter from the Association of American Railroads
dated March 2, 2023, into the record.
Mr. Nehls. Without objection.
[The information follows:]

Letter of March 2, 2023, to Hon. Pete Buttigieg, Secretary of
Transportation, U.S. Department of Transportation, from Ian Jefferies,
President and Chief Executive Officer, Association of American
Railroads, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Donald M. Payne, Jr.
March 2, 2023.
The Honorable Pete Buttigieg,
Secretary of Transportation,
U.S. Department of Transportation, West Building--1200 New Jersey Ave.,
SE, Washington, DC 20590.
Dear Secretary Buttigieg:
I am writing on behalf of the freight rail industry to inform you
that all seven Class I railroads have agreed to join FRA's voluntary
Confidential Close Call Reporting System (C3RS), as requested in your
February 27, 2023 letter to the Class I CEOs. The industry absolutely
shares your commitment to establishing effective mechanisms to help
prevent future accidents like the derailment in East Palestine. You
will hear from each of the railroads individually in response to your
letter as well. I write to provide important history and context
regarding railroad use of close call reporting, hopefully to pave the
way for working with you, FRA, and our employees to develop an even
better system.
It was two Class I railroads--Union Pacific and Canadian Pacific--
that actually initiated the first C3RS pilot programs with FRA in 2007.
All Class I railroads have longstanding programs in place that allow
employees to provide confidential feedback on safety issues. These
programs range from establishing and using anonymous reporting hotlines
to processes that incorporate peer review teams and root cause
analysis, much like C3RS. The railroads value receiving this type of
close call information in a timely manner because it allows them to act
quickly and proactively to address safety issues before they lead to an
accident. The Class I railroads expect to continue to operate these
internal confidential reporting programs in addition to their voluntary
participation in C3RS.
As you know, some railroads currently participate in FRA's C3RS
program while others that formerly participated dropped out of the
program because it was viewed as less effective than their existing
programs. We want to work with FRA to make the C3RS program better and
more effective. In that spirit, we are identifying certain aspects of
the current FRA program that have historically led to railroads
declining to participate in favor of their own internal programs. We
believe these matters can and should be improved. Our interest is in
seeing a streamlined process that maintains important confidentialities
for both reporting employees and carriers while also efficiently
sharing high quality safety information so that railroads can quickly
take appropriate action to address legitimate safety issues. More
specifically, areas for improvement include:

Quality of reporting: The information provided by
employees is currently routed through NASA's reporting system. As noted
by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), often the
information received is insufficient for railroads to act on because it
does not contain enough detail to develop practical corrective
actions.\1\ NASA staff, who are understandably not familiar with
railroading, face difficulties with gathering the needed additional
information. We believe these issues can be easily addressed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ GAO Report, ``Better Communication of Safety Information Could
Improve the Close Call System,'' pg. 20-21. https://www.gao.gov/assets/
gao-23-105287.pdf

Speed of reporting: Feedback on a close call that did not
result in an accident takes a long time to reach the railroad. Indeed,
NASA's procedure requires it to wait at least 30 days before it reports
to the railroads, which makes a quick response impossible. This too,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
should be addressed.

Confidentiality: There are concerns that FRA may have not
always kept close-call reporting data confidential. Protocols that
protect the confidentiality of the information will ensure continued
and robust participation. The Federal Aviation Administration has such
protocols in its Aviation Safety Reporting Program (ASPR), and we
believe similar protocols should be adopted by FRA.

Addressing repeated unsafe conduct: Typically, the person
reporting a close call is exempt from the internal disciplinary process
that would otherwise apply in the case of a violation of safety rules.
AAR recognizes that protection as a necessary feature of the program in
the vast majority of circumstances. However, in the rare situation in
which an employee is misusing the system to prevent his or her unsafe
decisions or actions from being addressed by the railroad, the program
should permit the railroad to address that repeated misconduct with the
employee. This is needed for the safety of the railroad, its other
employees, and the public.

Sharing of information: To the extent the information
collected by the program is useful in improving safety practices and
policies, it should be shared with the wider industry and in a timely
fashion. GAO has made this recommendation and AAR agrees.

As you know, FRA had already scheduled a Railroad Safety Advisory
Committee (RSAC) Meeting for March 14, 2023 to address this program.
AAR's members look forward to participating in that meeting to provide
their perspectives on the opportunities and challenges related to close
call reporting.
We are committed to continuing the 20-year trend of continuous
safety improvements in the rail industry. We look forward to working
with you and with FRA on these critical issues.
Sincerely,
Ian Jefferies,
President and Chief Executive Officer, Association of American
Railroads.

Mr. Payne. In this letter, all Class I railroads commit to
joining the Department's Confidential Close Call Reporting
System.
Mr. Daly, how has the historic funding for rail allowed for
improvements to CSX's network?
Mr. Daly. I am sorry, I couldn't catch the last part of
that question.
Mr. Payne. How has the historic funding for rail allowed
for improvements to CSX's network?
Mr. Daly. Yes, absolutely, we have partnered with many
States and different entities that applied for various grants,
signed on letters of support, and looking forward to those
coming through the process and coming to fruition to benefit
us. CSX ourselves is not able to be a direct beneficiary or
applicant for any of these awards, so, we partner with other
interested parties and support their applications.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
And Mr. Chairman, I will yield back.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you sir. I now recognize Mr. Babin for 5
minutes.
Dr. Babin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank all the
witnesses here, as well. I appreciate it. Just some little
aside reasons and maybe reasons to build, to not build high-
speed rails.
The COVID pandemic changed a lot for our country. And
unfortunately, a lot of these changes appear to be here to
stay. And commuter rails certainly appear to be a very popular
way to get from home to work in many urban and suburban parts
of our Nation. However, according to the U.S. census, the
number of people working remotely has now more than tripled--
more than tripled--during the COVID pandemic.
And while some businesses and employers are now bringing
employees back into the office, many pundits seem to think that
as technology develops, more and more folks will skip the
office and work remotely. And while I personally take issue
with that for some sectors--look at Washington, DC, where
Federal employees are still at home, many in their sweatpants,
instead of coming to the office and doing their jobs--I leave
it up to the individual businesses to do what works best for
them.
But when it comes to publicly funded transit, however, I do
take issue with putting the American taxpayer on the hook for
expensive transit projects that may become a highly funded
relic in just a few short years if we were working more and
more from home. To clarify, I am talking about commuter rails
that are supposed to get folks to and from work.
And this question is for anyone who really would like to
respond on the panel. Please give us your thoughts about the
data that you have seen on commuter rail utilization in the
telework era, or a thought on how future of work mixes with the
future of transit. Who would like to take a stab at that?
Mr. Ohanian. Well, Mr. Congressman, your point about remote
work is very prescient. Your concerns, I think, are very
reasonable.
Right now, about 30 percent of U.S. workers are engaged in
some type of remote work. It is projected by some economists to
rise to 40 percent. In my State of California, 34 percent of
workers are working at some point remotely. One in four are
working full-time remotely. So, that is very significant, and
that obviously has important implications for transit and for
congestion and for general commuter paths.
Dr. Babin. Thank you very much, and I have got another
question.
I want to say welcome, Mayor Watson, thank you for being
here today.
Mr. Watson. Thank you.
Dr. Babin. As a Texan and a former student at UT, Austin is
a great town, with a lot of fond memories in my heart and mind.
The Texas high-speed rail efforts have certainly changed a
lot over the last 35 years, since the former Texas Lieutenant
Governor, with a handful of lobbyists and investors, first
tried to make this happen in the late 1980s. Since then we have
seen various iterations of the project come and go with foreign
investors as well as Americans. We have seen the project
renamed, new maps, a whole lot of change with who is pushing
this project.
And while this project was once declared to be--this is
something concerning to me--100 percent privately funded, it
now appears that many of these proposals--in fact, most of
them--are now asking for taxpayer funding for the projects.
And you have been in government for about 30 years, Mayor,
as a State senator and other--you have worn lots of hats, which
is long enough to cover the entire lifespan of the California
high-speed rail. So, I was going to ask you to please tell us
what lessons you have learned watching and observing
California's challenges with their high-speed rail project, and
how those lessons are being applied to what is happening in
Texas.
And then tell me why you think that the current high-speed
rail effort in Texas is different from former attempts.
Mr. Watson. Well, as you know, I left the senate back in
2020, and so, I haven't been in the senate for a while, so, I
have not followed closely all that is going on right now with
the high-speed rail plan. But there are a couple of lessons
that we know ought to be learned.
One is--we have talked a little bit about them here today--
one is what mistakes were made on the front end that aren't
being taken into account as you move forward on this, including
potential risk.
The other is that we need to recognize that pretty much all
systems worldwide, when you are talking about rail, all systems
worldwide, even the very successful ones, they end up needing
some sort of public help in much the same way that we deal with
our roadways and our airports as other transportation.
So, I don't think that we should rule out high-speed rail
because it has not met some people's expectations in other
places. We can learn from those mistakes, and I think we ought
to look at ways that we make sure it works well, even if it
requires supplement.
Dr. Babin. OK. Thank you very much.
And I am out of time, so, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mr. Babin. I now recognize the
ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Larsen, for 5
minutes.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thanks
for this hearing. It is a great hearing.
I think one of the first lessons as Members of Congress we
should learn is anyone who comes to our office and says that
this rail line, this system is going be 100 percent privately
funded, we should just tell them to stop and start over because
they are wrong. And they are either--they were mistaken or they
were not telling you the truth.
In the 2000s, when there was an attempt to privatize
Amtrak, it was only going to be privatized by giving all the
taxpayer money that we currently give to Amtrak to a private
entity in order to do it. So, that is not actually privatizing
Amtrak, either. There is always going to be this mix of private
and public.
That said, I do think that because of the BIL, it created
the opportunities to actually do partnerships, true
partnerships with the private sector in providing rail lines,
and we should embrace that along with Amtrak. There shouldn't
be a conflict there at all here on the committee for that.
And with that, Mr. Ohanian, I wanted to ask you because
this is a little bit new for us, a little bit, I wanted to make
sure we are comparing apples to apples and apples to oranges,
and that when it comes to Brightline's L.A. to Las Vegas, which
is a great idea and great concept, right now you said they have
the projections, but they haven't built anything. So, if that
goes a dollar over the projection, should we be angry and upset
with that or not? Like, how should we judge the success of a
private-public effort versus just a singular public effort on
rail?
How should we assess the value of that dollar being used?
Have you thought through that?
Mr. Ohanian. Thank you. Well, I think one metric would be
on the basis of construction costs. Another metric would be on
the basis----
Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. You mean
comparing, like, a per-mile cost, for instance?
Mr. Ohanian. Yes, per-mile cost.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Per-mile cost.
Mr. Ohanian. Another metric would be on operating costs. We
are not there yet, obviously, with Brightline.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Nowhere near, right.
Mr. Ohanian. But that would be another metric.
Another metric would be in terms of successfully
identifying passenger demand. So, is it a route that people
really highly value? Is ridership intensity high or load
factors high? So, that would be another metric to judge.
And so, delays, costs, construction costs, operating costs;
are you serving a large market? I think those are all
reasonable metrics in which you can use to evaluate any segment
put together by any operator, whether it is public, private,
private-public partnership.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, sure. OK, thanks.
Mayor, good to see you again. We were in Austin earlier
this year. We had a chance to talk about a lot of things----
Mr. Watson [interposing]. Yes.
Mr. Larsen of Washington [continuing]. I-35 and
reconnecting communities and local transit efforts, as well as
rail.
And one of the things, with all the infrastructure
investment you are doing in Austin, around the Austin area, one
of the issues that you all brought up was workforce, the
availability of the workforce. And can you help us understand
maybe specific to passenger rail development--or anything else,
frankly--how you have come along since we talked last in terms
of ensuring not the number of jobs created for the operating
side, but how you are developing the workforce to be able to do
this work?
This is an issue that we have all over the country,
frankly, no matter what we are building.
Mr. Watson. Yes, I really appreciate that question. And
also, thank you for the time you spent in Austin.
A couple of things. We have about $20 to $25 billion worth
of infrastructure projects related to mobility that are in play
right now. One is a voter-approved rail system. One is the
airport, Interstate 35, and working with TxDOT on Interstate
35, and multiple others.
What we have done is, we have actually done studies to
determine: Do we have the workforce available to do all of that
work? And we have determined that we are going to need to
dramatically increase the number of people we put into career
paths to do that.
So, we have already begun the process of creating what is
going to be a mobility and infrastructure workforce academy so
that what we are doing is focusing as early as maybe late
middle school and high school to get people into career paths.
In fact, 2 weeks ago, I was here in Washington, DC, looking at
an infrastructure academy so that we could replicate the good
parts of that and make it a difference. So, we have made it a
focus.
I have visited with the mayor of San Antonio to see if we
can do parallel things so that we don't cannibalize each other
on this, and we actually put more people into the career path.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, that is, I think, an
important point, a lesson we are learning through BIL
implementation and every mode of transportation. So, I
appreciate that.
With that I yield back. Thank you.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. I now recognize Mr. LaMalfa for 5
minutes.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate this
hearing and your expertise you brought to it. This is going to
be for my colleague from the bay area, Mr. DeSaulnier: Like a
deja vu all over again, right, sir? Anyway, see you, pal.
So, we have heard a lot already about the California high-
speed rail. I call it high-cost rail, and we will go into it
more. But jumping from a pricetag the voters were shown back in
2008 of $33 billion to, only 1 year later, $42 billion with a
new estimate, and then when I was in the State senate there it
went up to $98.5 billion only 3 years later in a 2011 hearing
we had. And now we see $128 billion and skyrocketing, $128
billion. So, they are projecting every mile will cost $200
million--for 1 mile. A good track runner can do that in 4
minutes, yet this is taking many, many years.
So, I would like to ask Ms. Mortensen. At some point, it
seems like it is just an inexcusable waste of money for people,
especially with other projects in California, our crumbling
roads. You ought to see the right lane on I-5 for a good part
of my district, the water storage we need in the State, so many
other infrastructure things we could be doing.
I put it this way. If you were sold--instead of $33
billion, let's say you had a bid on reroofing your house for
$33,000. And then they come back when they show up to do the
work, oh, that has gone up from $33,000 to now $128,000.
Wouldn't you be looking for a new bid? Wouldn't you be looking
at, hmm, maybe I would like to do this over again? I actually
attempted that with a bill when I was in the State senate to
put it back on the ballot when we saw the price had tripled.
Didn't get very far, but at least we got the point out.
Ms. Mortensen, at what point do we cut this burning boat
loose?
Ms. Mortensen. Well, thank you for the question, and it is
a tough one, especially being in California, being a
constituent, being in the area that could be served. So, I have
straddled various positions on this issue.
I think we are overseeing what, for us, is a large program.
And given this current bid environment, we are experiencing
things many industries are, and we have had to take a step back
and think about: Can we deliver everything that we had planned
pre-COVID when the estimates were done?
So, I think at some point a step has to be taken backward.
I know there is extreme pressure on the California High-Speed
Rail Authority to keep moving forward, to keep solving the
problems, to keep finding the money. But I think taking a step
and assessing what can really be done that has the benefit----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Oh, we recall, though, that the
original $9 billion was supposed to be supplemented by private-
sector money coming in and investing in it like Brightline that
we heard talked about today. That private money is not to be
found. They are running away from this project.
Ms. Mortensen. It is not, and that----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. And, of course, subsidies are
disallowed for the ticket price, too. So, go ahead.
Ms. Mortensen. So, as Members have mentioned here about the
risk; contractors, because their livelihood depends on it, are
very keenly looking at where they will take risk. And they will
take it, as you see with Brightline. But I think that
opportunity in the high-speed rail program was not fully vetted
at the right time to let contractors come in at the right time.
So, they haven't, and I think----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. I am going to turn to Dr.
Ohanian on that. That is a great point because the initial
business plan that the voters would have seen some part of in
2008 really didn't--obviously, it was only a year later it
jumped from $33 billion to $42 billion. They didn't even have a
plan for where the route was going to be, including the all-
important boring through the Grapevine, if that is what they
decide to do.
How are they even going to get over the top from the
Bakersfield area into Los Angeles? Is there any idea? What does
the plan look like for the route as well as the money?
Mr. Ohanian. I don't know the details of the route at this
point, but----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. I don't think they do, either.
Mr. Ohanian. I think the project remains--it was obviously
risky in 2008. The project remains risky today for some of the
same reasons it was 15 years ago and for some new reasons,
including the important reason to--you are stewards of Federal
funding. There is an enormous backlog of transportation and
infrastructure maintenance and depreciation needs to be taking
place.
And if we look at what is going on right now, the
Bakersfield-to-Merced route is $35 billion. And I know that
people in the Central Valley are delighted to have those
dollars coming in, but I think if they were given the option of
having a $35 billion check to spend as they would like on
various types of public projects----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Water storage?
Mr. Ohanian [continuing]. Versus having--water would be
very, very important.
The California Policy Center has estimated that $128
billion would be enough to retrofit the Diablo Canyon Power
Plant, to build two new powerplants of the same size, and to
pretty much guarantee water security for California, a State,
as you know, that is chronically hit with droughts and the
challenges and issues that come with water rationing.
Mr. LaMalfa. At $4 billion per dam you could build 30 dams.
We only need three or four.
I better yield back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mr. LaMalfa. I now recognize Ms.
Wilson for 5 minutes.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you, Chair Nehls and Ranking
Member Payne, for this important hearing.
Navigating the future of intercity travel is a critical
issue in my district. My community of south Florida is one of
the most congested urban areas in the Nation. Miami is the
eighth most congested city in the world, and my neighbors are
losing over 100 hours a year in bumper-to-bumper traffic.
As one of the five cosponsors of President Biden's landmark
infrastructure bill, investing in the future of rail is
critical. My district has over a half dozen railroads,
including Tri-Rail and Brightline, servicing Dade, Broward, and
Palm Beach counties. A robust intercity rail system will not
only ease congestion, but also provide residents with more
transportation choices. When folks take more rail, fewer cars
will be on the roads, allowing residents to get to places
faster along with reducing carbon emissions. We must protect
our environment.
Now, when we discuss intercity rail, we must also address
rail safety. I am proud we included $5 billion in CRISI funding
in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. We must utilize these
rail safety funds to directly address rail safety in our cities
to ensure we have a robust passenger rail system that includes
high-speed rail that is safe for the people in the community.
I call myself the champion of rail safety, and I will
continue to urge for additional funding to address rail
crossing improvements and other deterrents to ensure that
intercity rail and citizens can coexist safely and harmoniously
in our communities and stay alive. With that, I have a few
questions for the witnesses.
Mr. Daly, the benefits of passenger rail for mobility and
the environment have been well documented. Today, we discuss
both successful and less successful projects. What should
communities consider when discussing a new passenger rail
project to ensure success?
Mr. Daly. Yes, absolutely. Thank you for the question.
When evaluating any potential new service, you have to look
at the benefits of that. Is the ridership there to support it?
Clearly, in your district, it appears it is.
The other side is that you don't create a new problem by
solving the initial one. With beginning some passenger service,
if you have a pretty good ridership where you have got
approximately 200 people on a train, you get 200 cars off the
roads. If for some reason the proper planning is not put into
place to protect the rail service in the area where the rail
service now becomes unreliable and causes additional trucks to
go onto the roads, you are creating a problem worse than what
you started with.
One boxcar equals about three trucks. So, protecting the
level of business that you have in that area today, and also
protecting the ability for those businesses to grow into the
future is really critical in balancing the interests of both
passenger and rail, and the health of the overall line.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. OK. In my district, CSX has an
operating agreement with the South Florida Regional
Transportation Authority for the Tri-Rail commuter rail
service. And Tri-Rail, because of that, is reporting a 25-
percent increase in ridership this year. Can you discuss how
partnerships like these with CSX have worked with local
communities nationwide?
Mr. Daly. Yes, absolutely. Our partnership with the SFRTA
has been very beneficial. They have been a great partner in the
region. We are excited to continue to work with them on
additional opportunities, as well as, the TPO in Miami has been
having discussions with us, as well, about other opportunities
that they have looked at, and we are cooperating and working
with them on whatever vision they do ultimately decide on.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. OK. Thank you.
Mayor Watson, in your testimony, you talked about how the
Texas Department of Transportation is working to address
intercity rail in the Texas Triangle. In south Florida, we have
private high-speed rail already connecting the State's three
most populous counties. Can you discuss the importance of
intergovernmental commitment to improving mobility and
supporting local economies?
Mr. Watson. Yes, and thank you for that question. I think
it is paramount, if we are going to meet the needs of the
people of this country, that there be bipartisan,
intergovernmental cooperation. The Texas Department of
Transportation has applied under the corridor planning program
for funding, grant funding.
And I am very supportive of that because I believe that
will allow the local governments along these--particularly in
the Texas Triangle, along those corridors--to work directly
with the Texas Department of Transportation and other
governmental entities to try to come up with the best way for
Amtrak and others to be involved in that. There is just no way
we can do this without that cooperation.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. I yield back. Thank you.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Ms. Wilson. I now recognize Mr. Kean
for 5 minutes.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I
would like to thank the witnesses for being here today.
Passenger and commuter rail travel is vital for the
Northeast Corridor, and specifically for New Jersey.
Specifically, Amtrak and New Jersey transit play a key role in
New Jersey residents traveling to and from work, and families
seeing each other during holiday seasons.
Additionally, Federal discretionary grant programs that
support intercity passenger rail travel, like the CRISI program
and the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail
Grant program, provide for good jobs, increased economic
viability, and safer rail travel.
We must have a clear and consistent coordination between
the Federal Government, State and local governments, and
private industry to ease our supply chains to relieve rail
choke points and make sure that passengers get to their
destinations on time. This committee's goals in overseeing
passenger rail travel should be safety, security, and
predictability, meaning on-time departures and arrivals in a
responsible manner.
Finally, my bill, H.R. 1547, the One Seat Ride Act, which
passed this committee in July, focuses on passenger and
commuter rail. This bill would go a long way to allow Seventh
Congressional District residents along the Raritan Valley Line
of the New Jersey Transit to commute more efficiently and to
travel to see family more often by rail.
Mr. Daly, you mentioned in your written testimony that
about $0.40 of every dollar earned in the railroad industry
goes back into the upkeep of our railroads, and that the
American Society of Civil Engineers gives rail infrastructure
the highest grade for infrastructure conditions, as compared to
all other transportation modes. How do the Federal
discretionary grant programs help CSX maintain their lines, and
how do those programs aid in CSX working with entities like
State-sponsored rail lines like New Jersey Transit and Amtrak?
Mr. Daly. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question, and thank
you for your support on Point-No-Point Bridge.
Yes, I mean, CSX is, obviously, not able to be an applicant
for any sort of Federal grants, but we do partner with many of
the local entities or other lines that are applicants, and work
with them and support them in their requests for funding, which
can benefit multiple parties for their requests.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you.
Mayor Watson, you mentioned in the first topic in your
testimony that the investments in Amtrak go to improving and
upgrading Amtrak's assets and fleets. But often forgotten are
the other improvements that Amtrak may implement with adequate
funding, such as the modernization of stations, the
installation of technology stations that keep passengers safe,
like security cameras, and connections to other transportation
services.
Can you tell me how investing in Amtrak and these other
Federal grant programs can help improve the customer
experience?
Mr. Watson. Sure, and that is a very important part of
this.
The fact that there has been a significant amount of money
put into this program, if spent right and done right, will
address, for example, on-time service. We have to demand that
the trains run on time, if you will. And that is one of them.
The stations, including ADA compliance, will be a very
important part of how this money is spent. Upgrading those
stations so that they actually provide service, as opposed to
just being a building where you gather before you get on a
train or get off a train, those sorts of things will make a
difference and will increase the ridership.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you, Mayor. I agree with your
sentiment and your statements.
Mr. Chairman, I now yield the remainder of my time to the
gentleman from California, Mr. LaMalfa.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Kean, I appreciate that.
Dr. Ohanian, following up, did you say earlier what the
speed you thought was going to be for the route from Merced to
the orchard somewhere near Bakersfield? How fast would the
train be going on that route, on average?
Mr. Ohanian. Well, the----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. It was supposed to be 220 miles
an hour for the whole system.
Mr. Ohanian. Yes, there is a large difference between
maximum speed and average speed. And of course, average speed
is what is relevant for travel time.
I don't know the current projected speed. What I do know is
that earlier business plans seem to have overpredicted average
speed by, potentially, a considerable amount. They were higher
than any average speed that was being attained in high-speed
rail systems in Europe and Japan.
Mr. LaMalfa. Because the bond the voters were promised, a
220-mile-an-hour rail would get from S.F. to L.A. in about a
little over 2 hours, and it doesn't appear attainable.
Therefore, it would disqualify the bond from actually being
accurate or legal.
Mr. Ohanian. The original estimate was 2 hours and 40
minutes. I believe the current estimate now is a little over 3
hours. That still seems quite optimistic about an average
speed. And of course, average speed is fundamentally connected
to how many stops will be on the route----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Thank you. I had better yield
back, sir. Thank you.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you.
To note, Mr. Daly, your on-time performance for Amtrak is
over 90 percent. I read that in your testimony. I said you
continue to improve that. That is a very good job.
OK, I now recognize Mr. Moulton for 5 minutes.
Mr. Moulton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It is
striking to me that here we are, having a hearing on passenger
rail in the United States, and we don't even have a single
witness to talk about high-speed rail, someone who really
understands high-speed rail, which just shows how behind the
world we are.
Japan has had a high-speed rail network since 1964. They
have had zero fatalities. I don't think we can say that about
our highways or our airlines. You can travel all over Europe on
high-speed rail. You can go to Paris from London for dinner and
be back in time to go to bed. And yet we can't rely on Amtrak
to get to New York in a couple of hours.
Some people refer to the Northeast Corridor as high-speed
rail but, as Dr. Ohanian pointed out, what really matters is
average speed, not top speed. The top speed on the Northeast
Corridor is 150 miles per hour. That doesn't even qualify as
high-speed rail in the rest of the world. And the average speed
on the Northeast Corridor is below 100 miles per hour.
Now, we are rightly celebrating what Brightline has done
with private-sector investment and innovation in Florida, and
so far, the success has been impressive. For those of you who
are skeptical as to whether people will ever ride trains,
specifically high-speed rail, you might look at what is
happening in Florida, where simply having new trains, faster
trains, great customer service, and convenience is attracting
significant numbers of riders, and those trains go 110 miles
per hour, 110 miles per hour. That is half the speed of trains
in China.
What other thing does America do that we say China can do
it twice as good as we can, they can do twice as well as we
can? Is there anything that we just throw up our hands and say,
nope, China is just literally twice as good as us? And yet that
is what we are apparently doing with high-speed rail.
Now, Mr. LaMalfa, a perennial critic of California high-
speed rail, brought up the fact that the average--that the
travel time from L.A. to San Francisco has gone up from 2 hours
and 40 minutes to a little over 3. Now, there are a lot of
reasons for that embedded in California politics and the
engineering that has been made to accommodate California
politics. But the bottom line is this: 3 hours is enough to get
people to take the train over flying.
There are countless ridership studies, but even more actual
experience across the world that shows that if you can get by
train somewhere in even 4 or 5 hours, you are more likely to
choose it than flying. I mean, even look at the experience on
the Northeast Corridor, where Amtrak is not exactly known for
great customer service, and yet 75 percent of the business
travel market between Washington and New York is on Amtrak's
Acela. So, when you look at the Northeast Corridor, when you
look at Florida, I think it's pretty hard to argue that no one
is going to take this train if the high-speed rail line gets
built.
Now, Dr. Ohanian has said that we just can't do big
infrastructure projects in America. They cost too much.
Dr. Ohanian, let's just say the State of California were to
embark on a project to build, well, say, 4,000 lane-miles of
highway and 91 new airport gates. Do you think that that
project would come in on time and on budget, or would you
expect cost overruns for a project of that scale?
Mr. Ohanian. Our experience with large-scale projects
typically does involve significant delays and cost overruns----
Mr. Moulton [interrupting]. OK, because that is what
California would have to do if they don't build high-speed
rail: Build 4,000 lane-miles of highway and 91 new airport
gates. And at the end of that, they would be able to meet 2050
travel demand.
But you would not be doing anything to serve any of the
cities in between L.A. and San Francisco, so, it would solve a
problem for L.A. and San Francisco, but it would do nothing for
any of the stations in between, it would do nothing to improve
the traveler experience. For everyone who still chooses to
drive, they would actually be going slower than they do today
because adding lanes adds congestion. Instead, you could build
California high-speed rail.
Now, we agree that the project has been mismanaged. We
agree that there have been eminent domain and environmental
approval issues. We agree that we should do better than
California. But you can't just say California is terrible
because it hasn't been well run. You have to look at the
alternatives, and we are not doing enough of that in America.
Mr. Chairman, I hope we can do more of that in the future.
Thank you.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mr. Moulton. I now yield 5 minutes to
Mr. Burlison.
Mr. Burlison. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Ohanian, in your testimony you write about how the
California rail is currently a failure. The project has taken,
obviously, longer than expected, and it has been more expensive
than originally thought. It now costs taxpayers $120 billion,
and basically has empty promises. That is a whopping $200
million per mile on this project.
Would you say that has failed because--as was mentioned
before, there are projects, Brightline, private investment
projects that are successful. Would you say that this is a
failure because it is a government-run project?
Mr. Ohanian. It certainly seems that way. It is hard to
reach a conclusion other than that, given 15 years of delay,
given the cost overruns, given the obvious problems that
plagued the system from the get-go, including a business plan
that didn't identify how funding would be secured, that didn't
identify a break-even point, that didn't provide expected
environmental review completion dates. It was just very, very
lacking.
In the private sector, there is an incentive to provide a
competitive return to your investors. And we can't say that has
happened with California high-speed rail.
Mr. Burlison. Yes, and in order to do that, you have to
provide a value to the customers who want to actually purchase
the product. Do you see the demand?
I mean, it has been talked about that California would need
thousands of highway-miles to replace the traffic. Is that
demand--I mean, is that accurate, that people want to pay, that
there is a demand?
Because my thought is, if there is a demand, if people want
to pay for it, there is probably a private business that would
be willing to step forward to make a profit.
Mr. Ohanian. Yes, the very striking issue is that the
private sector is incentivized to find routes where people
really want the service. Government not so much.
And to get back to a couple of the statements Mr. Moulton
made, at the end of the day, it is all about: Can the costs
come close to justifying the benefits? And the projected
ridership on California high-speed rail was noted by both Cato
and the Reason Foundation as being far too optimistic,
including ridership intensities that exceeded those in Japan, a
country with much more densely populated cities and much less
auto ownership.
So, I personally just don't see how those numbers came
about. The Legislative Analyst's Office criticized this
business plan for not providing the forecasting methodology. I
still haven't seen the forecasting methodology provided, 15
years later.
Mr. Burlison. So, the project is $120 billion at this time.
And how many miles of rail is it?
Mr. Ohanian. We are now looking to build 171 miles at a
cost of $35 billion between Bakersfield, which is a city of
about, I believe, 400,000 people, and then Merced, which is a
city of only about 90,000 people.
Mr. Burlison. So, compare that. In the State of Missouri,
the legislature just approved a $2.8 billion expenditure to add
six lanes, or to make I-70 six lanes all the way from Saint
Louis to Kansas City, 250 miles for $2.8 billion, and yet this
project is costing over $100 billion.
Mr. Ohanian. Yes, it is about 50 times as much as the
number you just cited.
Mr. Burlison. Yes, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield the rest of my time to my
colleague from California, Mr. LaMalfa.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Burlison.
If we talk about adding 4,000 lane-miles in California, you
could put an extra lane on I-5 both directions and on Highway
101 both directions and get a lot of traffic through there.
Plus, it hits every town along the way between L.A. and San
Francisco. So, that is an interesting fact.
Ms. Mortensen, we know that under the original bond the
voters passed by a narrow majority that subsidies are
disallowed for the ticket prices. Otherwise, it disqualifies
the bond and there is a lot of people in a lot of trouble. What
do you expect that--I mean, with your experience with Amtrak,
which--I like Amtrak, I like riding the train, whether it's
Baltimore to here after I fly in, or up and down on a trip we
made here recently. I like the east coast train, but it's bang
for the buck, like Dr. Ohanian was saying.
What's the ticket price going to have to be if it's not
subsidized in order to ride California's high-speed rail with
your experience of what Amtrak costs are?
Ms. Mortensen. Well, if I come at it from a private
perspective, the pricing is going to be adjustable, flexible.
So, you would figure out peak period times where a lot of
people wanted to go, and you could probably lower the pricing.
You could also play a little bit with through service. And
I know it sounds silly on a 171-mile corridor, but you could
have through service, express service that you could charge
more for.
So, I think it would be a flexible system with perhaps
ticket prices somewhere around $40 for smaller trips or lower
pricing fare windows, and it could be up to over $100 for
people that might want to pay for an express trip. And I
think----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Those are Amtrak prices,
though. But for the rail, the high-speed rail, in order to have
to cover its much higher costs, what do you think the ticket
price would have to be for that?
Ms. Mortensen. It depends. Some of the models show
different what I would call underlying base costs than the
Amtrak Northeast Corridor. They are projected to be lower. We
could debate whether or not that comes true because a lot of
things are not coming true. But under that model, you could do
flexible pricing, you could do flexible train times, which are
different than what are currently in the plan.
Mr. LaMalfa. Yes, I am going to have to cut you off here, I
am over again. But----
Ms. Mortensen [interposing]. Got it.
Mr. LaMalfa [continuing]. There are a lot of things that we
do not know that--we are way off on projections. Like, 1
million jobs, for example, was being sold years ago.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your indulgence. I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. Yes, sir. I now recognize Mrs. Foushee for 5
minutes.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the
witnesses for being here today. I am happy to be here to talk
about an issue that is top of mind for my district and the
State of North Carolina.
North Carolina's Fourth Congressional District is one of
the fastest growing areas in the entire country, home to world-
class research universities and community colleges, vibrant
small businesses, community-oriented nonprofits, and the
Research Triangle Park, which is the largest research park in
the Nation. The Triangle region is expected to expand by nearly
80 percent in the next 40 years, and North Carolina has the
third highest population growth, according to the U.S. Census
Bureau. But we are struggling to keep up with the demands that
come with the rapid growth in an area, and this is,
unfortunately, reflected in our transportation infrastructure.
So, my first question is to you, Ms. Mortensen. You have
considerable experience starting up new passenger rail service
and managing legacy services. Do you have recommendations for
communities like mine who are looking to expand existing
service or start new service?
Ms. Mortensen. Well, thank you for the question.
I think I would suggest really listening to the people on
the ground. I am sort of your bootstrap ground representative
here. And listening to the people--and what the people say
changes over time. So, having an ability to sort of predict a
system that can roll with how people's attitudes will change.
Certainly, yes, commuting is less these days. But people are
moving further away and new people are commuting, so, we are
offsetting some of those commute losses. So, I think listening
to the ground game of the people.
And then, if you are operating on the Class I railroad,
really sitting down upfront, there are ways to work together.
Maybe your optimal window isn't available to run a train, but
maybe half an hour earlier, half an hour later. Just the
flexibility, taking out some of the more high-level politics
from it, trying to make sure the ground game works, and then
building up the ground game.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you for that.
And Mr. Daly, thank you for highlighting in your testimony
the good work my State, North Carolina, has done to improve
intercity passenger rail service in coordination with CSX.
North Carolina has also been a regional leader in working to
coordinate service from the Southeast region. We are perhaps
lucky to have freight rail right-of-way in the S-Line that we
are now looking to repurpose for intercity passenger rail.
That, along with the strong support from my predecessor for
Federal investment in the S-Line purchase.
My first question to you is: How can we continue that good
work? Specifically, how did you work with multiple stakeholders
across Democratic and Republican Governors in Virginia, and how
do you see that model applying elsewhere?
Mr. Daly. Yes, ma'am. Thank you for the question.
I would say North Carolina is on to a great start. You have
got a very solid NCDOT there, with Jason Orthner as your
director of rail that does a great job, and we have a great
relationship with him that we value very much.
In addition to that, the S-Line, we signed a letter of
support for that application to get the funding for that
purchase, and we are looking forward to continuing to work
closely with NCDOT on their desires and the applications that
they have made with the FRA Corridor ID Program, as well.
One issue that we still have to overcome--and we are
working on it--is one of the four pillars I had mentioned, the
liability aspect, something that was not able to get through
the State--the legislature last year. I understand it is coming
back up this year, and it seems to have much stronger support,
so, we are excited for that.
To the second part of your question, working with different
stakeholders and things like that, I think, really, NCDOT, our
relationship with them is very much like VPRA and the Northern
New England Passenger Rail Authority up in New England, where
you have a strong State partner that has a true vision, and the
focus to get there, and the recognition that--not only freight
preservation, but the ability to grow and the introduction of
passenger service, to do that in a way that allows both parties
to be successful. It really gets across any party lines or
anything else. It is looking at a problem in a feasible way,
and looking for the best solution for all parties because, as I
mentioned previously, adding some passenger service in there in
a low-cost, quick way to only have a detrimental effect on your
freight business is going to create a much larger problem that
is much more difficult to fix at a later time.
So, really going in with the eyes wide open, having a
strong plan and a strong partnership is the best way that I
have seen.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you.
And Mr. Chairman, that is my time. I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentlelady yields. I now recognize Mr.
Westerman for 5 minutes.
Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the
witnesses for being here today.
I have been in Congress since 2015, and I think we have
been talking about high-speed rail projects since then. There
doesn't seem to be a lot of real positive progress that's being
made. But I am very intrigued with high-speed rail.
Conceptually, it seems like it should work, it seems like a
great solution to a lot of problems.
And Mayor Watson, I have said that if we can't make it work
in Texas, I don't know where you could make it work. When you
look at the terrain, the topography, the population centers, it
seems like almost a perfect fit, if you can make high-speed
rail work, that Texas would be the place to do it.
I know Florida offers a lot of those similar features, and
even some of the innovations out there, like what Elon Musk had
proposed, which is--I don't know if you would call it high-
speed rail, but the vacuum tubes with the cars that are
levitated above the rail. When you get into the details of
that, and look at Federal regulations, it is more like airlines
than it is rail in a lot of ways, with the speeds that you are
talking about and the all the complexities of that. We know it
works other places in the world.
But I want to talk about a subject that really hasn't been
brought up today. There has been a lot of talk about the
economics of high-speed rail, how do you make that work, the
cost of high-speed rail. But when we look more broadly at
infrastructure projects, we have a hard time in this country
approving and building major infrastructure projects.
There was a report that came out in 2015 by an organization
called Common Good, where they looked at the cost of delays due
to NEPA. At that time, they said a 6-year delay was costing the
U.S. $3.7 trillion--that is with a ``t''--and they attributed
$1.22 trillion of that to the rail sector. So, I don't know
that much about this organization, I was just doing that
research when we were looking at NEPA reforms in the Lower
Energy Costs Act earlier.
And we actually implemented some reforms that said that you
could only have 2 years to do an environmental impact
statement, 1 year to do an environmental assessment short of
the--or reduce the number of pages that could be in each of
those from 75 to a maximum of 300.
Also, during testimony from the American Public Works
Association in hearings we're having on NEPA, the president of
the APWA testified that ``While the Federal Government does
appropriate funds for projects like these across the country,
some communities are deciding against applying for Federal
funds due to the onerous nature of permitting requirements,
including NEPA. In my experience, any time Federal funds are
introduced into a project, we immediately added at least 25
percent to the project budget. However, the final cost could be
significantly higher than that.''
So, we are still trying to figure out the technology and
how to make these things economically viable. And maybe we can
start with Mr. Daly and just go down the line. How important is
permitting reform to building any kind of rail project?
Mr. Daly. Yes, sir. Thank you for your question.
It is not something that I am personally very involved in.
I am aware that it does cause some significant changes to
initial timelines when we have them. So, I am sure I have
colleagues that are much better versed to speak to you on the
matter, and we can definitely follow up with you, as well.
Ms. Mortensen. Thank you, and I would be happy to. I have a
very painful example. We have what I call a mega-project, a
$400 million project, ready to go out to bid. And we have gone
through the NEPA and CEQA processes. We are cleared. We had a
permitting issue that arose in what I would call a dry slough
that hasn't had water for years, but we are struggling to make
improvements so that it could be fish habitat, which is fine,
making those mitigations for someday when that happens.
But the project was delayed now because there needs to be a
review and approval process after we are all done and ready.
And where that really impacts is the back end of the project.
This project, every month delayed is 3 percent; 3 percent on
$400 million is a lot of money. So, we start racking that up
because we can't move. And so, any improvements in that process
would be very welcomed from the ground side of things.
Mr. Ohanian. I am glad you brought up this important point
because, in my experience, permitting delays are a huge
deadweight on the U.S. economy right now.
To give an example in California, 30 years ago,
developers--and this is not related to rail--but developers
proposed to build a new city just outside of Los Angeles. It
would be a community of about 60,000 people. California
politicians on both sides say they want nothing more than more
housing to reduce housing costs. Thirty years later, not one
house has been built. There may not be ever a house built in
this new community, which is called Tejon Ranch, about 40 miles
outside of Los Angeles, and it is all because of environmental
delays regarding permitting.
How can anyone ever take a risk to create something big
when they face the real, very real possibility of just becoming
completely bankrupted by the political permitting process?
So, thank you for bringing up this important point.
Mr. Watson. We are over time, but I will be quick in
answering.
At the local level, we are, in fact, at the city of Austin,
going through a very detailed process to review our permitting
process, because as we deal with the needs for affordable
housing, we can't get in our own way. That ought to be the
first rule.
But Government has to play a role in making sure things are
safe, making sure things aren't going to have unintended
consequences, and it ought to play a role in making sure that
it provides the system and funds the system to make sure that
the permitting can be done right. It is not just enough, I
think, to say, well, permitting may be getting in the way, so,
let's just do away with permitting. It serves a real role, and
then it is going to require Government to say, let's know what
our purpose is, and let's fund it well to make sure it works.
Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Nehls. I now recognize Mr. Johnson for 5 minutes.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank
you, witnesses, for your time and your testimony today.
For decades, Americans have cried out for infrastructure
policy in this country. And for decades, those cries fell on
deaf ears of Congress. However, last Congress, we got our act
together, and along with the vision of President Biden, we
passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the IIJA,
which is a once-in-a-generation investment in our Nation's
infrastructure and competitiveness.
And although my colleagues on the other side of this
subcommittee, on the other side of the aisle in this
subcommittee and all but one of them on the full committee
voted against the IIJA, I am proud to see that they and their
constituents are benefiting greatly from it.
My State of Georgia has already begun to see the fruits of
the passage of the IIJA in rail alone. The $2.5 billion in
Federal funding for rail projects in Georgia has enabled the
expansion of healthy, sustainable transportation options.
Mayor Watson, the Texas Department of Transportation has
submitted three proposals to the FRA's Corridor ID Program for
segments linking the Texas Triangle of San Antonio, Houston,
and Dallas. Your testimony mentions the Texas Triangle, and you
discuss how developing passenger rail service there will
produce robust ridership in return for relatively modest
capital investment. How would this regional hub serve as a
model for intercity passenger rail?
Mr. Watson. Thank you for the question. A couple of things
very rapidly.
One is, it has a dense population and has a growing
population. It is the center, if you will, of the State of
Texas' economic growth and economic development. And the
metropolitan areas that we are talking about are located,
really, within about 300 miles of each other so that it
provides the ideal, if you will, of being a little bit too far
to drive on congested roadways, but too short for airplane
flights. And I could go into detail on that.
I think it would, because of the latent demand, it would
show a success. And because of the projections of what you are
going to have in future demand, it would continue to grow that
success.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. Could you speak to how
the completion of a proposed expansion of the Amtrak Crescent
route from Atlanta, Georgia, to Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, would
further benefit the triangle and in particular, the
economically disadvantaged communities, both inner-city and
rural areas, that this project would run through?
Mr. Watson. Well, one of the values of these projects is
that it will--it is not just for the beginning and the end. It
is not just for Atlanta and just for Dallas-Fort Worth. It
benefits all of those cities and communities along the way that
otherwise don't have, for example, air service. They would have
to go someplace else in order to get an airplane.
And the cost that is involved in that, this ought to be the
redundancy that would get built into something like this. Not
just roads and not just airports, but the redundancy of having
the potential for rail would benefit a greater, I believe,
number of people and, in many instances, those people that
otherwise might not be able to afford to travel.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Now, Dr. Ohanian does not care for
the regulation of environmental impacts on economic
development, but I am sure that there are some environmental
benefits that would accrue from expanding intercity passenger
rail and allowing thousands of people to travel every day
without needing to drive a car. Can you comment on that?
Mr. Ohanian. Yes, I will make two brief points. One is
that----
Mr. Johnson of Georgia [interrupting]. Well, that question
was for Mr. Watson, but since you are----
Mr. Ohanian [interposing]. Oh, I am sorry.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia [continuing]. Since you are in it,
go ahead.
Mr. Ohanian. My apologies.
Mr. Watson. I thought I heard you say his name, too.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Go ahead, Professor. Well, I said--
I just commented on the fact that the professor does not really
care for costs associated with environmental regulation, but I
was asking what----
Mr. Watson [interrupting]. One of the real goals that can
be achieved is by reducing the amount of mobile source
emissions with regard to cars, reducing the amount of need for
air travel--well, not reducing it, but providing an alternative
to those things--should make a difference and will make a
difference with regard to emissions that contribute to climate
change.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you.
And I am over my time, so, I will yield back.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Garcia for 5
minutes.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Chairman Nehls and
Ranking Member, for holding this hearing today.
Accessible public transit is a matter of justice. It can
mean the difference between getting to school on time, keeping
a job, or having access to basic needs. For example, in
Chicago, the IIJA helped us fund the Red Line Extension
Project, which will finally connect the far South Side to
downtown Chicago. This project was promised 50 years ago; the
IIJA has helped deliver it.
Cities that have previously been disconnected from other
regional hubs can benefit from increased access to businesses,
healthcare centers, and jobs if they are connected by intercity
rail. Expanding passenger rail is not only an efficient and
sustainable transportation choice, it is also one that can help
enable economic opportunity and racial equity, as well.
Mayor Watson, as your testimony states, intercity passenger
rail can fill a gap in regions that are only otherwise easily
accessed by car. How does intercity rail bring us closer to our
climate goals, and why is this especially important for the
vast regions like Texas?
Mr. Watson. Congressman, I would say two things in response
to your statement.
One is, as I indicated, I believe that by providing an
alternative means for travel that doesn't produce additional
mobile sources that we see from vehicular travel and from
airplanes, you have a positive environmental impact.
Second, with regard to your comment related to justice, one
of the things that I would see is a real value related to
having intercity passenger rail, for example, in the triangle,
is that you would allow students that need to get through
community college training or otherwise to engage in career
paths. They might be able to attend schools at different
places, but they can't do that right now because of
transportation issues that hopefully would be reduced if not
eliminated if you had better intercity passenger rail.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Great. Thank you for that,
especially the workforce emphasis.
Similar to the Texas Triangle, I have been supportive of
the Chicago Hub Improvement Program in my home State, which
would invest $1.1 billion to revitalize Chicago rail
infrastructure and connect it to surrounding States like
Michigan. It would reduce a major bottleneck in southwest
Michigan and cut travel time between Chicago and Detroit, as
well.
Mayor Watson, can you elaborate on how projects like these
could benefit riders?
How specifically does the Texas Triangle project plan to
service previously disenfranchized communities, including low-
wealth and individuals with disabilities?
Mr. Watson. Certainly, I have two quick reactions to that.
One is, as I indicated a little bit earlier, these kinds of
programs don't just benefit the major city, if you will, the
San Antonio, the Austin, the Dallas-Fort Worth. If you look at,
for example, that leg of the triangle, you have about 800,000
people that live in the Killeen-Temple area. And you have Waco
along those ways. You have communities that it would then allow
them maybe not to live in the major metropolitan area because
of cost or otherwise, but still be able to participate in those
economies.
The second thing that I would say about that is that
careers that allow people to move from one city to another--
let's say mobility and infrastructure and the construction that
goes along with that--it might allow people to work in other
places.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Very well, thank you so much. And
finally, my last question for Mr. Daly.
As CSX is working with the Commonwealth of Virginia to
build capacity for freight and passenger rail between
Washington, DC, and Richmond, your testimony mentions that the
route will allow the double stack freight trains, while VRE and
Amtrak simultaneously want to double the number of passenger
rides along the same corridor. What is CSX doing to ensure that
safety is prioritized during this increase in rail capacity and
ridership?
Mr. Daly. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question. We are
working extremely closely with Virginia, VPRA, at all levels.
Our engineering departments meet on a regular basis to go over
the track work. Obviously, whenever there is any work going on
on the track, we have safeguards in place: blocking, taking
tracks out of service, locking them out, whatever is necessary
to provide safety to the employees performing that work. And
obviously, a significant amount of coordination with our
partners there.
Like I said, on the engineering side, operations speaks
regularly. There is an executive performance management team,
as well, that gets together regularly and talks about all the
projects, report-outs from the other committees, and talks
about what we have going on, and making sure that we can
achieve our goals together.
Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you for that.
Mr. Chairman, thank you for your indulgence, I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr.
Stauber for 5 minutes.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
In Minneapolis, the Southwest light rail is being
considered a boondoggle of historic proportions. In 2011, the
Federal Transit Administration approved the Metropolitan
Council's application to pursue funding for Southwest light
rail through a Federal grant program. In that year, the council
projected that the line would cost $1.25 billion, and that it
would begin service to the public in 2018. Since 2011, the
Metropolitan Council has increased its estimate of the
project's cost several times. By March of 2022, the council's
projected budget for the line was approximately $2.74 billion
for an opening in 2027. According to the Associated Press, this
is one of the most expensive public works projects in
Minnesota's history.
Mr. Ohanian, passenger rail projects seem to meet shocking
price challenges and massive delays across our country. What
can Congress do to avoid these transportation boondoggles and
more wisely invest taxpayer dollars?
And what might the private sector be able to contribute to
these projects?
Mr. Ohanian. Well, there are some data points that suggest
the private sector can do this much more effectively, much more
efficiently, much more quickly, for example, based on
Brightline's project in California. So, that appears to have
some potential and promise for you to consider as stewards of
Federal funding for these types of projects.
Honestly acknowledging risk is so fundamentally important
because, as you noted, these projects historically are
substantially delayed, they have substantial cost overruns. And
I suspect that if we do require these projects to provide a
plan based on realistic risk assessments, I think a lot of them
just won't pencil out in terms of costs and benefits.
Obviously, you need to prioritize a wide number of
projects, and that can be important information to you in your
decisionmaking process.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you. Prior to me entering Congress, I
was a police officer for 23 years, and I want to talk about
crime.
A November 2022 article from the American Experiment states
that the Metro Transit light rail system in Minneapolis has
consistently operated as one of the most dangerous light rail
systems in the country since 2014. According to the Federal
Transit Administration, 40 percent of all personal security
events that occurred on America's 22 light rail systems in 2019
happened on Metro Transit.
Mr. Daly, in your opinion, what makes passenger rail so
vulnerable to crime, and what has CSX done to improve the
safety?
Mr. Daly. Yes, sir, thank you for your question.
CSX has a robust PSCC department that works actively with
local and State officials with the safety on our yards, our
trains, our tracks. I know they also coordinate very closely
with Amtrak and their own police department and the activities
that they partake in their stations and on their trains.
As far as the Amtrak or passenger side, how they handle the
safety, is something that--probably a better question for them.
I am not particularly----
Mr. Stauber [interrupting]. But from your experience, why
do you think it's so vulnerable to crime?
Mr. Daly. It's a fair question. I mean, some of the
stations are in isolated areas. Some of them may not be as
well-lit as, say, clearly an airport, but other modes of
transportation.
There is not particularly the security of TSA on boarding
onto passenger trains. So, I am sure that is a factor that
plays in, as well.
Mr. Stauber. So, in your opinion, do you think there needs
to be more law enforcement presence?
Mr. Daly. I can't think of a situation where safety
wouldn't be improved with additional law enforcement presence.
Mr. Stauber. You can't think of a situation?
Mr. Daly. Where an additional presence of law enforcement
would not equal into more safety.
Mr. Stauber. I just--Mr. Daly, I want to be sure that I
heard you right, and I may have misunderstood you. Are you
saying that more law enforcement presence wouldn't make crime
decrease?
Mr. Daly. No, sir.
Mr. Stauber. I misunderstood you, then, OK.
Mr. Daly. Yes, yes. Additional law enforcement presence
would equal into additional safety.
Mr. Stauber. That is right.
Mr. Daly. Yes, sir.
Mr. Stauber. I appreciate that question because I agree
with you very much.
Mr. Chair, I see my time is up. Thank you, I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize my good
friend out of California, Mr. DeSaulnier, for 5 minutes.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I really want
to start my comments, as I have told you personally--Mr.
LaMalfa, thank you for taking us down memory lane, when we both
voted the same way on authorizing the funding for high-speed
rail. The second time I was the only Democrat in the
legislature, even though I chaired the committee.
But to this, I think there is a real opportunity to have
the right mix, so, the proper Federal oversight for projects
like that and others. And, Ms. Mortensen, I want to start with
you, because I have so much history with your project, starting
in local government, when my party affiliation was different
many years ago, and we were working with the bay area with 7\1/
2\ million people in the 10 counties that surrounded it. They
were becoming this mega-region that, to your point, is very
geographically challenged in terms of access.
So, we worked well with multiple counties, multiple
transportation entities, local government, the State, and
private sector. So, you have got the fourth busiest port in the
United States, one of the busiest export ports for agriculture.
All of that worked, but it took a lot of work, but we still had
proper oversight and shared risk with pretty good modeling,
both for the freight side and the commercial side, even though
the dynamics of that corridor were changing so dramatically as
Silicon Valley all of a sudden appeared, and we had the
opportunity for the private sector actually to fund the
Dumbarton Bridge all the way across there.
So, speak about--just briefly, because I really want to
talk to the other Californian on the panel--about cost and
being realistic about it, and apples to apples, not apples to
oranges. Just speak a little bit about our experience: land
use, transportation funding, Prop 13. All of those conspired to
make your project so difficult, but also how it interconnects
to the valley and prospectively to Los Angeles.
Ms. Mortensen. Well, I think interconnection is a key word.
We are not just looking at a transportation mode, a line on a
map. So, it is interconnected with land-use visions for each of
the communities. And what is done in San Francisco and Oakland
and San Jose may be different than what is done in Stockton and
Manteca and Modesto.
But we fought through. We fought, and it got very hard, but
we stayed with it. And so, I think while we end up with bruises
at the end, we come out with a product that the people can
trust. And sometimes I think today we get to where it's really
hard, and then there's a faction that wants to kill something,
there's a faction that wants to throw their hands up. But I
think staying with it across different perspectives and really
fighting to get it done, you will get the best product at the
end because you have the view of both sides and many angles.
And I'll stop there.
Mr. DeSaulnier. And in your case we went through the
existing cumbersome process.
Ms. Mortensen. We did.
Mr. DeSaulnier. But we had to work with multiple MPOs.
Ms. Mortensen. We did.
Mr. DeSaulnier. And local government and the State
transportation agencies. And when you throw cap and trade in
there, you had to deal with the air regulators. But we did it.
Dr. Ohanian, I really appreciate your comments, but I would
hope you would agree that just going to public-private doesn't
solve the problem, either. We have got plenty of examples
around the country and the world. The first big project of
then-Governor Schwarzenegger was Doyle Drive in San Francisco,
which proportionately was as bad a project, but it was that
idea that public-private will save the world.
As you know, in your studies, getting the risk associated,
whether it is a fully funded public project or a public-private
partnership around the world--and we have examples in South
America, where public-private partnerships were awful--getting
that risk assessment is so important. So, could you speak a
little bit to that?
Brightline may work, but if it is public-private, it could
be a disaster, as well, if the contractual relationships aren't
thoughtful.
Mr. Ohanian. Yes, my comments were to indicate that various
kinds of models could be used to create high-speed rail. Their
cost numbers look very favorable right now. Of course, they
seem to be ready to break ground soon, so, we will have to see
how that plays out.
A separate issue is that America is just a very high-cost
producer of railway, whether it is high-speed rail or subway
systems. I looked to some data that compared costs across
countries for high-speed rail, and France and Germany are doing
it at about half the cost that we are. And I hope that at some
point we can get to the bottom of why our cost differences are
so big.
Secretary Buttigieg noted this 2 years ago----
Mr. DeSaulnier [interrupting]. But, Doctor, excuse me,
because I only have limited time--and I would love to continue
this conversation--some of that is a function of culture, but
it is also how they are subsidized.
I mean, the best model that I have seen in the world--and I
have been all over the world looking at this--is in Japan. But
both culturally and density and how the funding is--and the
mayor will understand this, every State being different--all of
that is different.
So, we had to do our modeling for high-speed rail in
California, to begin with, to compete with Southwest from L.A.
to San Francisco. That's subsidized, too.
So, Mr. Chairman, I will stop there. I am sorry to
interrupt, but I would love to continue the conversation
because I think there is a real opportunity here to get this
right. Texas is searching. We need to have rail. We need to
have rail, passenger rail and freight rail. We would have to
have better accountability. And that should be nonpartisan.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Williams for 5
minutes.
Mr. Williams of New York. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I direct
my first question to Mr. Daly.
CSX has made a bid in Virginia, an investment in Virginia.
Can you describe some of the metrics that were used to identify
that as an attractive venture? I am trying to get to: What are
the building blocks of that kind of decision?
Mr. Daly. Yes, I mean, it was a request that came from
Virginia, who we have been in partnership with for decades,
ever since we started, many, many years before my tenure. There
has been a continued growth and desire for additional passenger
services, so, it's something that has been discussed ongoing
for many, many years.
We performed many studies over the years to evaluate the
potential to introduce additional passenger services, and we
had a pinch point there with the bridge. The Long Bridge was at
capacity, running 98 percent prior to this agreement that we
entered into, which is going to build an additional bridge
across the Potomac to allow for additional passenger services.
So, once we really put together a full-vision plan for how
this looks for the next 30, 40 years is when we were able to
put all the pieces together to not only validate the additional
services, but also the investment for the bridge and property
acquisitions and additional trackage rights, as well.
Mr. Williams of New York. And the property acquisitions
were fairly small compared to, like, California, that has to
get an entire new--or Texas, even--that has to get an entire
new right-of-way. Is that right?
Mr. Daly. That's correct. Yes, sir.
Mr. Williams of New York. OK. And in terms of your study,
do you know some of the key metrics, the go/no-go decisions
there?
Mr. Daly. The RTC study that was performed previously on
the bridge was just looking at throughput initially. Studies we
have done since then as we started working through the planning
process looked at the current level of on-time performance,
future growth of the freight network in the area, and the
impacts of adding in the additional passenger trains, looking
at delay metrics primarily.
Mr. Williams of New York. OK, thank you. I am trying to
understand why the east coast seems to have figured out the
secrets to rail, even something like Brightline, where there
were tracks, but not necessarily a culture of rail traffic, at
least not in the last 50, 60 years, not that much.
Expanding in Virginia; we have Amtrak where I live,
upstate, it gets the Empire Line. And I have actually lived all
over the country, so, I know the California geography and the
Texas geography quite well.
And I am wondering, what are the metrics for success that
get evaluated in the Virginia case? And what are those in, for
example, the California or the Texas case? And why is there
such a discrepancy between what seems like a pretty viable
culture of rail on the east coast, and yet it seems very
difficult to replicate anywhere else?
It is a sincere question. There is no political gotchas at
the end of it. I am actually trying to understand what are the
metrics for success and trying to use Virginia. So, we just
have a short amount of time, but if any of you can throw out
any ideas, I would appreciate it.
Ms. Mortensen. Well, I think California is a bit ``wild
West.'' We really overemphasized the car, probably more so than
any State, and we are paying some of the consequences of that.
Not that we don't need highways, we do. We have got multiple
ports, we have goods movement all over the place. At some
point, that may be all the highways carry because we have that
much goods movement.
But I can say from my own personal example, it does feel
harder in California. It does feel like there are delays that
come up at the last minute that can't be predicted. And I think
we have to look at the root model of what's causing those
issues before we start the projects. Perhaps we haven't done
that as well in the past as we should.
Mr. Williams of New York. Well, it seems like politics is
big. The fact that BART doesn't connect to Caltrain is a
disaster, and it was a decision made in the, what, 1970s or
whatever.
Any other thoughts?
Mr. Watson. I think that we ought to be learning from
Virginia and North Carolina and some of the things that are
happening there. And some of the metrics that we will see there
is population, the density of that population, the potential
growth of that population, demographics, and the economy, and
how, in the case of intercity passenger rail like we are
talking about in the Texas Triangle, how near those entities
are so that people are incentivized to use that because their
alternatives are not that great, either it be on a congested
roadway or a very short flight that costs a lot of----
Mr. Williams of New York [interrupting]. I have driven them
all, and also appreciate Southwest Airlines.
One last quick question is: $128 billion, it looks like, in
the California project. Do you think Texas could build that
railway for less than $128 billion? Anybody?
Mr. Ohanian. I certainly think they could.
Mr. Williams of New York. I think so, too. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. Thank you. Hey, I would like to thank the panel.
I know we are approaching 2 hours here. I think this has been
just a wonderful conversation. I think a lot of great points
have been made, either from the questions that have been asked
by this panel, but we have a few Members who would like to go
to a second round. Do you feel that you could hang out for
another 10, 15 minutes so we can finish this?
I would like to recognize Ranking Member Payne.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank the
panel for obliging us. Just one question I have for Ms.
Mortensen.
Congressional Republicans have proposed cutting funding to
Amtrak's national network by nearly 35 percent. There was even
an amendment 2 weeks ago to eliminate national network funding.
What impact would that have on your San Joaquins Amtrak route?
Ms. Mortensen. Well, I will answer it a couple of ways.
California funds the entirety of their services. So, we pay
100 percent of the Capital Corridor, LOSSAN Corridor, and San
Joaquins. What I am hopeful of is it is sparring, positioning
to sort of get to the right-sized allocation, and that it sorts
itself out. Because I think operating funding that is predicted
and relied upon needs to be maintained. And so, I am hopeful
this is the moves on the chessboard that get to that allocation
that is necessary for operations.
And I do think Amtrak's IIJA process, while I didn't always
agree with their tactics, they did get a lot of public input.
And so, the public is built into some of those capital project
expectations. But I will leave it at that. Thank you.
Mr. Payne. OK, thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields. I now recognize Mr.
LaMalfa.
Mr. LaMalfa. I am back. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman.
Ms. Mortensen, what is the highest speed conventional
Amtrak train? Is it about 120 miles an hour if they are on the
highest grade track?
Ms. Mortensen. Yes.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK.
Ms. Mortensen. Yes.
Mr. LaMalfa. All right, and I did some math on that. It's a
little rough, but for the segment we are talking about from
Merced to an almond orchard near Bakersfield, about 165 miles,
so, I had it that if--given estimates of real-world speed for
high-speed rail in the area maybe being around 150 miles an
hour versus a 120-mile-an-hour Amtrak on its own rails, you
would save 16 minutes. So, I have to wonder what the value is
for the amount of investment just in that segment there of $35
billion.
Now, if you managed to run it at 220 miles per hour, it
could be down as low as 45 minutes. But it doesn't sound like
220 miles per hour is practical.
So, is it practical to have more 120-mile-an-hour Amtrak
trains if we eliminated a few more at-grade crossings, more
overcrossings, and upgrade the tracks we need to, probably for
a fraction of the price?
Ms. Mortensen. It does, and it could.
The issue of safety has been brought up, and one of the
real benefits for the forever future is a dedicated corridor
that gets rid of the at-grade crossings. And so, I know we
can't always achieve the ideal, but I think that is the ideal
more from a safety standpoint.
I think the reality of that first segment is that the train
sets will be geared towards a max speed of 150, but the average
speed, as has been mentioned, would probably be down closer to
100, 130----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. For the high speed?
Ms. Mortensen. For that initial segment.
Mr. LaMalfa. Yes, so, you are really not achieving a heck
of a lot more than what Amtrak conventional is available. But
let me jump to Dr. Ohanian.
We go from what we saw in 2008, a $33 billion project for
S.F. all the way to L.A., and what we are getting right now
seems to be $35 billion for about one-fourth, maybe one-third
of that. Do you think the voters would approve a $35 billion
Merced to an orchard near Bakersfield project?
Mr. Ohanian. I don't believe so. I don't see how that would
be practical for most voters. It wouldn't be a wise use of
public investment.
Mr. LaMalfa. And there doesn't appear to be a plan to get
through the bay area. I think they are going to have to link to
an existing project to go from San Francisco to south San Jose,
which is--they are not going to have high speed, it appears.
And getting into L.A., as we mentioned earlier about the
Grapevine, how are they going to even get it into L.A.?
So, it is not going to fulfill the goal for anywhere near
the price. Can the voters ask for a refund for that $9 billion
bond?
Mr. Ohanian. That is----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. That is a rhetorical question.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Ohanian. Yes.
Mr. LaMalfa. I won't make you answer that.
Mr. Ohanian. I agree, voters need some answers.
Mr. LaMalfa. But so much success with Brightline--or what
appears to be with the gambler special to Vegas and a couple
other locations. So, what model was Brightline bringing that is
not bringing investors or anybody for--again, we have $9
billion for California from the bond, $3.5 billion from the ERA
funding back in the stimulus package of 2009--2009, I say, it
is 14 years ago--and then they have been able to come up with
carbon taxes and auctions and get a billion here, a billion
there. So, they are going to maybe come up with $20 billion out
of the $128 billion, unless they come begging here for more.
What broke down with the California model versus what
Brightline can do with the gambler special to Vegas or the
other locations we are talking about?
Mr. Ohanian. Well, I think Brightline was very prescient in
being able to build low cost in terms of the land they were
able to acquire. That has been different relative to other
systems where there are disputes, eminent domain issues come up
over acquiring private land.
And kudos to Brightline. Assuming that it comes together,
as we all hope, they were able to identify a route with
substantial demand and be able to--look like--build it at a
very, very low cost. And both of those aspects, on the demand
side and the cost side, those are things we want to see.
Mr. LaMalfa. Yes.
Mr. Ohanian. And as you face a long laundry list of
infrastructure and transportation projects, I know you are
concerned about making sure that the funding goes to where it
should in terms of high rates of return. I wish I had better
things to say about my home State----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Well, me too. I better stop
there, but thank you.
We heard earlier, though, the assertion that if China can
do it, why can't the U.S.? Well, China, when they built the
Three Gorges Dam, they just built it. They didn't ask
permission, they didn't get permits. And the people that lived
in the flood space were told, well, I guess you better move.
Same thing. Can you imagine taking a couple of D11s and
going from here up to Boston to try and make a wider track? You
don't get to do that here. You have to go through permits. You
have to be respectful of property rights and all that. We don't
get just to pound through in this country. So, China is not
much of a model.
So, with that, Mr. Chairman, thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. I now recognize Mr. DeSaulnier for--go ahead.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This really is
sort of interesting. So, I want to go back to real examples. I
think this idea that having proper oversight at a Federal level
and incentivizing good performance in terms of risk assessment,
but you have got to--everything is different.
Brightline, what is so significant for Brightline--and I
support the idea, Doctor, as you mentioned--is the right-of-
way. It is there, it is largely existing, and the modeling for
the Inland Empire, there has been huge land-use growth there,
so, we can use regional like we do with the Valley to get
people out to these new exurbs.
So, it's just being consistent in getting the right
modeling and looking at high-speed rail in California and other
examples, including public-private projects that didn't work.
So, I understand that this is a political poster child,
perhaps. If we had gone down highway Interstate 5, as
originally proposed with high-speed rail, the cost assessments
would have been very different, would they not, Dr. Ohanian?
If we look back and look at Brightline now and the cost
driver in terms of right-of-way, and look at going down
Interstate 5 30 years ago, which was the original proposal, it
would be a very different cost benefit, would it not?
Mr. Ohanian. Very possible. Acquiring private land has
proven to be just a real bugaboo in these types of projects.
So, as you consider these types of proposals, that is an
important component to be very wary of.
Mr. DeSaulnier. And if you look at the Japanese model,
their JR lines, they start with a spine from Tokyo to Okinawa,
and then they go out. We could have done the same thing in
California. We could have gone down Highway 5 and then gone
out.
The bigger challenge, as I understand it in the history,
talking to people who have done these projects, is to hatch a
piece at that rate. To do 220 miles an hour, on average,
through the whole system was not an engineering feat that
anyone else had done at that grade. Is that your understanding,
Doctor?
Mr. Ohanian. That is my understanding. And I believe there
is still significant seismic----
Mr. DeSaulnier [interposing]. Right.
Mr. Ohanian [continuing]. Tunneling and viaduct issues to
consider in the system.
And at the end of the day, as an economist, I want to give
you the best advice possible. And it boils down to: Do the
benefits warrant the costs involved? And if they do, that's
terrific. And if they don't, then we should honestly assess
that and consider alternative projects that have a lot of
merit.
Mr. DeSaulnier. So, we have got this investment where it
is. I have got good friends who administer high-speed rail who
I disagree with--and people on that board--how best to take
that investment and still use it.
And so, Mr. LaMalfa mentioned this, getting into the bay
area now is where they have pivoted to, we have got population
decline right now in California because of the cost of housing
and because some of our businesses are moving to the mayor's
jurisdiction, and now you are having some of the same issues we
have. But learning from the past and still getting the vision
that we want is something that I think is very doable.
Ms. Mortensen, you are an example of that investment
potentially still being used to create the larger statewide
investment.
Ms. Mortensen. Yes, I think the decision point will be
coming soon where people will have to talk about what do we do
with what we have right now, and how do we make the best of it.
And we get a bit of a restart to sit down with the partners
again. The original vision that got sort of politically
shifted, is now difficult to achieve, but what can we achieve
that makes sense for the people that we are trying to serve
right now?
And I think dialogues like we talked about, that is the way
forward with the railroads, with the third-party experts who
know how difficult these things are on the ground, and then
with our State and Federal funding partners.
Mr. DeSaulnier. And lastly, the fiscal models change
because the cost to take the shuttle, whether it is Southwest
or United or Alaska, has also risen, if you went back and
looked at that.
I just want to finish with the mayor, because having come
from local government, we talked about telecommuting. In San
Francisco, we've got a 40-percent vacancy rate. People from my
district are not--if they are software engineers, they are
staying at home. It's a good thing. But we've got lots of old
government agencies in your area and our area that don't work
very well. So, this is an example. Could you speak to that in
Austin just for a minute or a few seconds, whatever the Chair
will allow?
Mr. Watson. Sure. First of all, we are seeing a number of
people--yes, you are seeing more remote working, and I think
some of that remote working is there to stay, but I don't think
it is as dire as some see, if ``dire'' is the right word. I
think it's not as extreme as some people see it. And certainly,
that has not been our case, including with our downtown, for
example.
I think in areas that are growing, even if they are doing
more remote working, you are still seeing the need for people
to be able to get from one place to another, and that demand is
there. Otherwise, you wouldn't have congested roadways,
otherwise you wouldn't have the airlines doing the way they are
doing. And so, we have to address that.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This has been a great hearing.
Mr. Nehls. Yes, sir. The gentleman yields. We have one
other Member just arrived. Mr. Duarte, you are recognized for 5
minutes.
Mr. Duarte. First of all, Ms. Mortensen, good to see you
here in DC. Thank you for your time spent near the district in
your Stockton office. Tell me--one dialogue we have had here in
this committee, in this subcommittee, over the year has been:
What are the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
requirements insofar as carbon-neutral, social justice,
diversity, equity, inclusion, American sourcing, doing to our
ability to spend that money in a way that gives American
taxpayers a bang for their buck?
A lot of these things load costs in that may or may not be
optimal.
Ms. Mortensen. Well, coming from the ground game, as I have
discussed, when there is something built into legislation,
either State or Federal, the language is somewhat generic and
oriented towards gains. But when we get down to the project
level and we want to talk about which specific emissions--
because they are tackled in different ways--and which
particular areas that are disadvantaged--because those are
tackled in a different way--so, there is not a monolith
approach, not a one-size-fits-all approach to driving these
goals down into the projects.
And so, we get there and we are not clear, and then the
reviewing agencies are not clear. And so, we can't know if we
are doing it right. And so, I think a better establishing of
expectations that are clear, that can be driven down into
communities and contractors is needed. And I feel like we have
a gap in the middle right now.
Mr. Duarte. So, do you think you are losing time? Like,
does a 1-year project become a 2-year project? Or what does
that do to your timing?
Ms. Mortensen. Well, in this particular day and age, with
inflation the way it is and cost risk that is now being applied
by contractors, every month you delay has a sizable impact on
the project. And so, you get 12 months in a row, 1 year could
be a staggering difference on project costs in this
environment.
Mr. Duarte. Thank you.
Dr. Ohanian, I really enjoyed your notes. I am from
California, and a big part of my district has the high-speed
rail through it, and I am not a supporter of high-speed rail. I
have seen it go over budget. I have seen it fail to perform. I
have seen it for 30 years now be a bit of a pipedream.
One aspect of it I haven't seen studied that I would like
to see if you have information on is: What is the carbon impact
of construction of the high-speed rail alone, and has anybody
studied what the ridership assumptions would have to be so that
we end up net carbon neutral or better by constructing the
high-speed rail versus driving on highways and building the
highways we need?
Mr. Ohanian. Right. So, building high-speed rail requires
cement and concrete, which is carbon intensive, and so, that is
a net negative. Off the top of my head I don't know the break-
even point, but what I do recall is that California's
contribution to global carbon emissions is less than 1 percent.
High-speed rail would reduce carbon emissions in terms of
moving people out of cars or airplanes and into high-speed rail
about 1.5 percent. So, you are looking at 1.5 percent of 1
percent is not really moving the needle.
Mr. Duarte. And does your 1.5 percent--I am sorry, does
your 1.5 percent estimation include the construction load and
carbon emissions? That is only the operating----
Mr. Ohanian [interrupting]. That is just the operating.
Mr. Duarte. So, we are building $128 billion carbon
emissions-laden project to save 1.5 percent of 1 percent of
global carbon emissions.
Mr. Ohanian. That's correct.
Mr. Duarte. And that would take a long time to offset if
there were substantial carbon emissions in the construction
alone.
Mr. Ohanian. Yes, it would. And of course, high-speed rail
was planned when the world was a very different place, before
California would only be selling electric cars by the year
2035. That was never taken into account in the planning, as
well, and that would make the project somewhat less desirable.
Mr. Duarte. So, would anyone that contends that California
high-speed rail is a project that will lead to lower carbon
emissions, net of its construction load, be fantasizing?
Mr. Ohanian. Based on the information I have and the
statistics I have seen, I just don't see it as moving the
needle whatsoever.
Mr. Duarte. Thank you very much. I yield back.
Mr. Nehls. The gentleman yields.
Before we conclude, I would like to point out that in your
testimony, Mr. Daly, it says that CSX averaged moving 1 ton of
freight 537 miles on a single gallon of fuel. I think that's
important to note, which is three to four times more fuel
efficient than moving 1 ton of freight by truck. I think that's
fantastic.
Listen, I don't think there are any other members on this
committee that have any questions. Seeing none, this concludes
our hearing for today.
I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here. Your
testimony was very insightful.
The committee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 1:20 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Submissions for the Record

Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen of Washington, Ranking Member,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
Thank you, Chairman Nehls and Ranking Member Payne, for holding
today's hearing on improving intercity passenger rail across the
country.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) was a monumental
achievement that supercharged our nation's investment in rail. Congress
supported $102 billion in planned funding for rail in the BIL.
The BIL boosted investment in transportation and infrastructure
that are creating jobs and growing our economy.
For intercity passenger rail, the BIL guaranteed multi-year funding
for state of good repair investments and corridor development.
It makes possible, for the first time ever, dedicated, reliable
federal funding--dispersed over five years--to improve and expand
intercity passenger rail.
The BIL is already investing in over 700 rail projects.
Earlier this year, the first round of competitive rail grants from
BIL was announced.
Among the recipients was the City of Burlington, Washington, in my
district, which was awarded a $2 million planning grant to identify
which one of its 16 at-grade crossings is most suitable for grade
separation, a critical investment that will help reduce congestion and
improve safety.
Burlington Mayor Steve Sexton brought the idea of improving at-
grade crossings in the city to me nearly a decade ago, and I am pleased
to see the City is able to move forward with this project, thanks to
BIL funding.
Earlier this month, the FRA announced funding for 25 projects along
the Northeast Corridor totaling over $16.4 billion dollars. These
investments include new bridges, tunnels, and track improvements over
the busiest passenger rail route in the nation.
I expect great results for communities will come from this grant
and the additional rail funding to come.
I look forward to the National Network funding and the Corridor
Identification announcements expected by the end of this year. These
grants will build on the investments states across the country have
been making for years.
The States, Amtrak and the FRA can now enact long-term plans for
passenger rail expansion and improvement, secure in the knowledge that
the funding will be there in future years.
I'm looking forward to hearing from our witnesses today about the
difference this budget certainty has made for them in developing and
sustaining programs, and how this will ultimately improve service for
rail passengers.
This funding is not only intended to improve existing rail service,
but to expand it. Cities and counties across the nation want more
frequent and more reliable passenger rail service, and increased access
to the national network.
Local leaders know that this will help their communities grow and
thrive and provide a cleaner and greener way to move people.
The communities that have rail service want better service. The
communities that do not, want service to start.
The FRA's Corridor Identification Program received more than ninety
applications, including two from the State of Washington, demonstrating
the need for additional service.
This Committee is committed to helping communities get the regular
and reliable passenger rail service that they want.
I will continue to push for Congress to fully fund its intercity
passenger rail commitments to create more jobs, grow regional
economies, reduce congestion and carbon emissions, and build a cleaner,
greener, safer and more accessible transportation network.
The BIL is also an investment in our workforce. Federal rail
funding will grow a well-trained, diverse workforce to build, operate
and maintain a national intercity passenger rail network.
The transformational investment in the BIL is a great start, but
Congress needs to build on this by ensuring reliable funding for
intercity passenger rail in the future.
At a minimum, we need to ensure that rail service is not hurt by
reckless cuts in appropriations negotiations.
Beyond that, highways, transit, airports and harbors all have
access to dedicated funding streams, enabling them to fund their long-
term major capital projects without being subject to the ups and downs
of the annual appropriations process.
Providing steady funding for intercity passenger rail will allow
states and communities the certainty they need to plan and deliver more
and better rail service.
I look forward to hearing from witnesses today who will provide the
Committee with useful perspectives on what it takes to run intercity
passenger rail, the outstanding demand for passenger rail, and the
benefits rail brings to communities nationwide.

Questions from Hon. Troy E. Nehls to Stacey Mortensen, Executive
Director, San Joaquin Joint Powers Authority

Question 1. There appear to be growing signs of problems in the
private insurance marketplace that provides insurance coverage for both
intercity and commuter rail agencies. This ``excess liability
insurance'' marketplace currently offers coverage only through overseas
insurers, and those insurers have been for the past several years
reducing overall capacity--or in other words--the levels for which they
are inclined to provide insurance. Most intercity and commuter rail
agencies insure up to the federal liability cap--currently $323
million. Has your organization experienced this tightening of coverages
and do you envision taking other measures to try and address the
inadequacy of coverage?
Answer. Rail liability insurance risks are generally underwritten
by the carriers based upon the individual merits and loss record of the
agency/service. Agencies viewed as high-risk have difficulty getting
the coverage limits. New agencies have difficulty as well. In an ideal
world for our agency which has operated service for over 25 years, our
``cap'' (which really means minimum insurance coverage) would be based
on our unique risks and safety record. An ever-increasing insurance cap
has a few negative unintended consequences:

Plaintiff's attorneys will sue to the maximum amount of
commercial limits. With a few unique exceptions, in a catastrophic
incident when the maximum coverage was $100M, plaintiff attorneys sued
for $100M. When it was $200M of insurance, they sued for $200M, and so
on.

The higher liability cap for all rail services also
creates excessive `ventilation' amongst the insurance layers needed to
get to the max limit. Where one carrier may have taken a $25M layer in
the tower under the lower limits, that layer may now be broken up among
2-3 carriers at $5M-$10 each instead with the higher cap. Each new
layer adds a cost to the program and in some ways, degrades the
program.

To provide this level of growing coverage capacity,
carriers under this new model of increasing caps have instituted
something referred to as ``double-double-half''. This means the fees
for the new layer are double, the deductible is now double what it was
and the coverage is half of what it was.

Ongoing cap increases are not correlated to the actual
rail service situations and market conditions.

Smaller rail services will have difficulty affording the
higher limits.

We would ask Congress what effect the full implementation of PTC
was supposed to have on minimizing or reducing insurance limits. The
limit was originally instituted because PTC was not in place at the
time of the Metrolink incidents.
We propose the index is reconsidered from CPI to be related to the
insurance market conditions, or a cost per passenger, or tailored to
the estimated risk related to the actual service. If there is a
catastrophic event, maybe there could be a federal fund to backstop
whatever exceeds the agency limit. This would be far cheaper than
requiring every passenger rail agency to purchase max limits unrelated
to their risk, and additional expenses would only be paid when
successful claims were proven.

Question 2. Current federal statute provides for the federal cap on
liability for all passenger rail claims to be adjusted every five
years. We have heard that when the federal cap is adjusted next in
2025, if the 30-day compliance provision is left unchanged, it will
cause problems across the entire passenger rail industry and could
jeopardize their ability to secure adequate coverage. Having 30+
commuter agencies, as well as intercity passenger rail providers
simultaneously seeking tens of millions of dollars in additional
coverages appears to be more than the current insurers can digest. The
Commuter Rail Coalition has proposed a modification to current statute
so that coverages would be adjusted to the new cap at the next
regularly scheduled policy renewal. Do you agree this change is
necessary?
Answer. Absolutely and we are supportive of the change and will be
asking our congressional delegation for their support (see above answer
for additional details).

Question 3. Currently the CRISI Program is only open to projects
that provide a direct benefit for intercity passenger rail and freight
rail. Commuter Rail agencies do not have a similar discretionary
program focused on passenger rail of which they can avail themselves.
This program provides significant assistance to privately-owned mostly
Class II and III railroads: it seems unusual that public tax dollars
are used to support mostly private entities while at the same time
denying public entities access to these funds. Would you support
broadening of the CRISI Program to make all commuter rail projects
eligible for funding under this program?
Answer. We have a unique perspective given that our agency manages
both ACE (commuter rail agency) and San Joaquins (intercity passenger
rail service), so we can look at the issue without a bias. The original
intention of the CRISI program was to establish a new federal funding
program for intercity passenger rail and freight railroads (mostly the
short lines). Commuter railroads already receive significant funding
through a long history of large dollar FTA programs. Broadening CRISI
would defeat the well thought out purpose of providing the only
reliable and competitive federal funding source for intercity rail
service.

Question 4. If this bill were to pass in the current Senate form,
it would have a significant impact on intercity passenger rail and
commuter railroads and could lead to notable in-service problems that
would threaten operator focus and concentration while not providing any
additional safety benefits to passenger operations. Under the proposed
requirements of the bill, there will not only be significant new
unfunded mandates, but it appears that the requirements could be
disruptive to passenger rail traffic. Does your organization share
these concerns?
Answer. If you are referring to the RSA bill/S.576, it does not
impact our operations. We would defer to our Class I partners on their
thoughts.

Questions from Hon. Marilyn Strickland to Hon. Kirk Watson, Mayor, City
of Austin, Texas

Question 1. How will the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law impact rail
service for your city in Texas?
Answer. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) authorizes and
appropriates record levels of federal investment in intercity passenger
rail. IIJA authorizes $137 billion for intercity passenger rail
programs and provides advance fiscal years 2022-2026 appropriations of
$66 billion for those programs, a 140% increase over funding provided
under the FAST Act. In addition, Congress has provided regular, annual
appropriations for many of those programs, which I hope you will
continue to do in the coming years. Investments in intercity passenger
rail are also eligible under several of IIJA's other surface
transportation grant programs.
These investments provide Austin with a window of opportunity to
work with USDOT, Amtrak, other intercity passenger rail providers, the
Texas Department of Transportation, other Texas local governments, and
the private sector to improve intercity passenger rail between Texas
cities.
My goal, and that of the City of Austin's local and regional
partners, is to make sure we leverage the opportunity presented by BIL.
Simply put, Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Administration will be
spending a lot of money on infrastructure improvements, facility
improvements, and new rolling stock in the coming years. As the Mayor
of Austin and a resident of the Texas Triangle, I want some of that
money to be spent on Texas tracks and Texas stations, and I want some
of those shiny new trains running in Texas and providing Texans with a
much-needed and long-overdue mobility option.

Question 2. As you know, major infrastructure projects can take
years to complete, much longer than most terms in office. How can you
ensure continuity between the state and local authorities when there is
turnover in office?
Answer. In Texas, we are developing a broad-based coalition of
state government, county governments, local governments, and the
business community to support the infrastructure investments we will
need to improve intercity passenger rail on the Texas Triangle.
Such a coalition is critical to ensuring Texas can leverage BIL's
historic levels of investment in intercity passenger rail to improve
mobility between Texas cities. A robust coalition will also help ensure
that the effort continues through changes in leadership.
I would add that we can address continuity in Texas. However, BIL
expires at the end of FY 2026. That may seem like a long time, but it
is probably not too early for me to begin advocating for the next
surface transportation bill to continue providing robust federal
investment in intercity passenger rail, so that we continue to have a
strong federal partner.

Question 3. As a former mayor, I know that incorporating local
voices is vital. How do we continue to ensure that local communities'
voices are part of the decision-making process at the state DOTs?
Answer. Robust metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) are
critical to empowering local elected officials to make surface
transportation investments that meet the needs and desires of their
communities.
Looking ahead to the next surface transportation bill, I encourage
the Committee to increase the power of MPOs to make decisions about how
to invest federal surface transportation funds, including increasing
funding for the Surface Transportation Block Grant and the
Transportation Alternatives Program, and the Carbon Reduction Program
and increasing the percentage of each program suballocated to MPOs. I
would also encourage the Committee to extend suballocation to the
PROTECT Formula Grant Program and the Congestion Mitigation and Air
Quality Program. All of these programs fund the types of surface
transportation investments that are best made at the local level.

Question 4. Congressional Republicans have proposed cutting funding
to Amtrak's national network by nearly 35 percent. Amtrak has stated
that would likely cease long-distance trains on the national network,
and Washington State Department of Transportation has told us that it
would likely increase costs for state-supported services. What would
the impact of these cuts be on your city or other communities across
the country?
Answer. They would hurt the momentum we and other communities
throughout the nation have developed. Austin is only served by two
long-distance trains per day, one northbound and one southbound. The
loss of that service would be a major setback just as we are on the
cusp of finally improving intercity passenger rail between Texas
cities. The 50 years of Amtrak history clearly illustrate that
eliminated routes are hard to bring back.
The entire history of federal surface transportation funding also
clearly illustrates that the federal program drives state and local
spending. When the federal government spent (and continues to spend)
tens of billions of dollars per year on highways, states responded (and
continue to respond) by building highways. Now that the federal
government is spending money on intercity passenger rail, many states
are looking to leverage those federal funds and spend money on
intercity passenger rail.
As I state in my written testimony, you get the transportation
system you pay for, in terms of both quality and mode share.
My understanding of BIL investments in all categories of
infrastructure is that they were intended to be in addition to, not a
replacement for, regular annual appropriations, in recognition of the
need to bolster our nation's aging infrastructure. I appreciate that
the federal government faces fiscal constraints, but cutting regular
annual appropriations for infrastructure would be penny wise and pound
foolish.
