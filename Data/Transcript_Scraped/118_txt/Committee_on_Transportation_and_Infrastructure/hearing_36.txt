SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Water Resources and
Environment
FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Water Resources and
Environment
RE:      LSubcommittee Hearing on ``Water Resources
Development Acts: Status of Past Provisions and Future Needs''
_______________________________________________________________________

I. PURPOSE

The Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment of the
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will meet on
Tuesday, December 5, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. ET in 2167 Rayburn
House Office Buildings to receive testimony at a hearing
entitled ``Water Resources Development Acts: Status of Past
Provisions and Future Needs.'' The hearing will provide Members
with an opportunity to review implementation of United States
Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) projects and policies that were
included in previous Water Resources Development Acts (WRDAs),
including WRDA 2022, and hear Administration testimony and
proposals for WRDA 2024.

II. BACKGROUND

THE UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS_CIVIL WORKS

The mission of the Corps is to ``deliver vital engineering
solutions, in collaboration with [their] partners, to secure
our Nation, energize our economy, and reduce disaster risk.''
\1\ The Corps is the Federal Government's lead water resource
development and management agency.\2\ Its water resource
program dates back to 1824 when it was established for the
purpose of improving river navigation.\3\ The role of the Corps
has evolved and expanded since then to include other main water
resource responsibilities.

\3\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today, the Corps' primary civil works responsibilities are
to support coastal and river navigation, address flood risk
management and storm damage, and protect and restore aquatic
ecosystems.\4\ Specifically, through its eight divisions and 38
district offices, the Corps manages 14,000 miles of levees, 740
dams, 12,000 miles of inland intracoastal waterways, 218 lock
chambers, and 13,000 miles of navigation channels.\5\

Nation/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Corps also provides outdoor recreation opportunities,
offers water supply storage to state and local partners,
assists in emergency response, and is a leading producer of
hydropower in the United States.\6\ In fact, the Corps is the
largest owner-operator of hydroelectric power plants in the
United States, which produce approximately 25 percent of the
Nation's total hydropower output.\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Corps' infrastructure portfolio is currently valued at
$206 billion.\8\ This valuation is referred to as its ``capital
stock'' and includes all water resources infrastructure built
by the Corps since 1928.\9\ The estimated capital stock value
increased $6.6 billion on average each year until 1982, when it
peaked at $357 billion.\10\ The Corps has reported that
deterioration, general wear and tear of infrastructure assets,
and asset retirements have contributed to a decline in the
value of the capital stock.\11\ Furthermore, the Corps has a
construction backlog exceeding $100 billion, in addition to
various authorized but unfunded studies and operation and
maintenance activities.\12\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To achieve its civil works mission, the Corps plans,
designs, and constructs water resources development projects,
typically in partnership with, and utilizing the financial
support of, non-Federal interests, commonly referred to as
project sponsors. The Corps' planning process seeks to balance
economic development and environmental considerations as it
addresses National, regional, and local water resources issues.

WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACTS

Congress generally authorizes Corps' studies, projects, and
programs and makes changes to agency policies through
legislation referred to as Water Resources Development Acts
(WRDAs). Congress has developed and enacted WRDAs
intermittently since the 1980s and has biennially enacted a
WRDA since 2014.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authorizing provisions in WRDAs can be project-specific,
programmatic, or general directives for the Corps. Project-
specific authorizations most often fall into one of three broad
categories: project studies, construction projects, or
modifications to existing projects. Furthermore, water resource
projects typically require two types of Congressional
authorization: (1) authority to study the feasibility of the
project and (2) authority to construct (and operate and
maintain, as applicable) the project.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\14\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IDENTIFYING WATER RESOURCE NEEDS

Generally, the first step in developing a project through
the Corps is to study the feasibility of the proposed project,
which typically requires Congressional authorization. Once
authorized, the Corps enters into a cost-sharing agreement with
a non-Federal project sponsor to initiate the feasibility study
process. The cost of a feasibility study is usually split
evenly between the Federal Government--which is subject to
appropriations--and the non-Federal project sponsor.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\15\ CRS Report IF113322, supra note 4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since February 2012, the Corps' feasibility studies have
been guided by the ``3x3x3 rule,'' which states that
feasibility reports should, generally, be produced within three
years; with a Federal cost of no more than $3 million; and
involve all three levels of Corps review--district, division,
and headquarters--throughout the study process.\16\ This
concept, enacted as section 1001 of the Water Resources Reform
and Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014, also allows for a waiver
of the 3x3x3 process for project studies determined to be
complex based on size, scope, or significance.\17\

available at https://planning.erdc.dren.mil/toolbox/library/smart/
SmartFeasibility_Guide_highres.pdf.
\17\ 33 U.S.C. 2282c.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the feasibility study phase, the Corps' district
office prepares a draft study report containing a detailed
analysis on the economic costs and benefits of carrying out the
project and identifies any associated environmental, social, or
cultural impacts. The feasibility study typically describes,
with reasonable certainty, the economic, social, and
environmental benefits and detriments of each project
alternatives being considered, and identifies the engineering
features, public acceptability, and the purposes, scope, and
scale of each.\18\ It also contains the views of other Federal
and non-Federal agencies on project alternatives, a description
of non-structural alternatives to the recommended plans, and a
description of the anticipated Federal and non-Federal
participation in the project.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\18\ Id.
\19\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
After a full feasibility study is completed, the results
and recommendations of the study are submitted to Congress in
the form of a Report of the United States Army Corps of
Engineers Chief of Engineers (more commonly referred to as a
Chief's Report).\20\ If the results and recommendations on the
proposed project are favorable, then the next step is
Congressional authorization for construction of the project,
which is typically given in a WRDA.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADDITIONAL CORPS AUTHORITIES

Congress has granted the Corps programmatic authorities--
Continuing Authorities Programs (CAPs)--that enable the Corps
to undertake small-scale projects with limited scope and cost
without requiring project-specific Congressional
authorization.\21\ These projects typically require a cost-
share with a non-Federal project sponsor.\22\

III. WRDA 2022

WRDA 2022 was signed into law as Division H of the James M.
Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023
(P.L. 117-263) and authorized 25 new projects, six
modifications to existing projects, 94 new studies, 12 project
modification studies, and 155 EI projects.\34\ This legislation
was principally focused on local priorities and projects, but
also included some broader policy and programmatic changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Specifically, WRDA 2022 authorized additional resources to
increase coastal resiliency, improve flood mitigation, and
respond to flooding events. For example, it increased the CAP
Federal project cost limit for streambank and shoreline erosion
projects from $5 million to $15 million.\35\ It also expanded
the scope of eligible work when repairing non-Federal flood
control projects (levees, dunes, beaches, dams) to include work
that increases resilience and addresses deficiencies of the
assets, in addition to repairing damage.\36\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\35\ Id. at Sec.  8103.
\36\ Id. at Sec.  8102.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This legislation also focused on improving the delivery of
water resource projects and meeting water resource needs in
communities across the United States. For example, it contained
provisions designed to analyze how long water infrastructure
permitting takes.\37\ It also directed the Corps to expedite
the completion of 25 authorized feasibility reports, two Post-
Authorization Change Reports (PACRs), two authorized watershed
and river basin assessments, one determination related to the
maintenance of a Corps navigation project, and modifications to
the scope of five authorized feasibility studies.\38\ In
addition, WRDA 2022 established two separate committees: one
for state and local partners to provide guidance to the Corps
on how to more efficiently and effectively complete projects,
and another to provide advice and recommendations to the Corps
on water resource assistance to Indian Tribes and other
economically disadvantaged communities in rural and urban
areas.\39\

WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACTS: STATUS OF PAST PROVISIONS AND FUTURE
NEEDS

----------

TUESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 2023

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:01 a.m. in
room 2167 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. David Rouzer
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Rouzer. The Subcommittee on Water Resources and
Environment will come to order.
I ask unanimous consent that the chairman be authorized to
declare a recess at any time during today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that Members not on the
subcommittee be permitted to sit with the subcommittee at
today's hearing in order to ask questions.
Without objection, so ordered.
As a reminder, if Members wish to insert a document into
the record, please also email it to
[email protected]
.
Again, that's
[email protected]

I now recognize myself for the purposes of an opening
statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID ROUZER OF NORTH CAROLINA,
CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON WATER RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT

Mr. Rouzer. First, I want to thank our witnesses for being
here today. And I want to apologize for the quick adjournment
of the subcommittee a few weeks ago when we had a few things
going on outside of all of our control. But in any event, I'm
very grateful to have you with us today as we begin work on the
2024 Water Resources Development Act.
It is helpful for the committee to hear directly from the
Army Corps at the beginning of the WRDA process because these
bills are the primary way Congress guides the Corps' projects
and priorities.
And as we all know, the Corps is the Federal Government's
lead water resources development and management agency. Next
year will mark the bicentennial anniversary of its first Civil
Works mission, which was to improve the safety and navigability
of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Over the past 200 years,
the Corps has expanded its primary missions to include flood
mitigation, coastal protection, emergency response, and
ecosystem restoration.
Whether urban or rural, inland or coastal, meeting the
water resources needs in communities across the country is
vital to our security, safety, and economic stability. Well-
functioning and reliable navigation systems allow for the
movement of more than 2 billion tons of cargo each year, levees
and dams help protect communities and critical industries from
flooding, and coastal restoration projects address erosion and
minimize the impacts of storm damage on seaside communities,
which is particularly important for my constituents in North
Carolina's Seventh Congressional District.
For example, in Brunswick County, the Corps is undertaking
a study to address beach nourishment needs for the next 50
years in Oak Island and Holden Beach. In Wrightsville Beach,
the renourishment project is set to finally move forward this
month thanks to the Corps' emergency exception allowing them to
use the historic Masonboro Inlet borrow site for sand.
Additionally, the town of Surf City anticipates receiving its
overdue beach nourishment upon the Corps' approval of funding.
By authorizing projects and studies and providing direction
on programmatic changes, WRDA has better enabled the Corps to
achieve its key Civil Works missions. Since 2014, Congress has
enacted a WRDA bill every 2 years with strong bipartisan
support, and we are going to continue that. This consistency
during the past decade has allowed Congress to respond to local
water resources needs more effectively. It also imparts
confidence that we can address water infrastructure needs that
may arise in the future, regardless of partisan discord that we
my find here in Washington.
Through these bipartisan bills, Congress has authorized new
projects and studies across the country. We have also
streamlined processes at the Corps, improved project delivery,
expanded opportunities for non-Federal project sponsors to
develop and execute water resource projects, and enhanced the
Corps' ability to respond to emergencies and disasters, to name
a few.
For my district, in WRDA 2022, we were able to authorize
the North Carolina National Coastal Mapping Study to map inland
and coastal waterways and identify potential hazards, such as
debris and sedimentation, that can lead and most often does
lead to increased flood risk. This study will lead the way in a
larger nationwide effort to invest in flood resilience, and I
am pleased funding for such was included in the House Energy
and Water Appropriations bill.
Additionally, it is important to emphasize that the success
of previous WRDAs is due in large part to the strong
participation from all Members, not just of this committee, but
throughout the House. Coordination with the Corps and
constructive feedback from non-Federal partners, as well as
other stakeholders, has been critically important as well. I
look forward to continuing this bipartisan tradition with WRDA
2024.
So, it is in that spirit that we are very, very pleased to
have Assistant Secretary Connor and Lieutenant General Spellmon
here before the subcommittee today to discuss their efforts to
implement WRDA 2022, as well as other priorities, as we move
towards WRDA 2024.
[Mr. Rouzer's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. David Rouzer, a Representative in Congress
from the State of North Carolina, and Chairman, Subcommittee on Water
Resources and Environment
I'd like to first thank our witnesses, Assistant Secretary Connor
and Lieutenant General Spellmon, for joining us today as we begin work
on the 2024 Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). It's helpful for
the Committee to hear directly from the Army Corps at the beginning of
the WRDA process because these bills are the primary way Congress
guides the Corps' projects and priorities.
As we all know, the Corps is the federal government's lead water
resource development and management agency. Next year will mark the
bicentennial anniversary of its first civil works mission, which was to
improve the safety and navigability of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.
Over the last 200 years, the Corps has expanded its primary missions to
include flood mitigation, coastal protection, emergency response, and
ecosystem restoration.
Whether urban or rural, inland or coastal, meeting the water
resource needs in communities across the country is vital to our
security, safety, and economic stability. Well-functioning and reliable
navigation systems allow for the movement of more than two billion tons
of cargo each year, levees and dams help protect communities and
critical industries from flooding, and coastal restoration projects
address erosion and minimize the impacts of storm damage on seaside
communities, which is particularly important for my constituents in
North Carolina's Seventh Congressional District.
For example, in Brunswick County, the Corps is undertaking a study
to address beach nourishment needs for the next 50 years in Oak Island
and Holden Beach. In Wrightsville Beach, the renourishment project is
set to finally move forward in November thanks to the Corps' emergency
exception allowing them to use the historic Masonboro Inlet borrow
site. Additionally, the Town of Surf City anticipates receiving its
overdue beach nourishment upon Corps approval of funding.
By authorizing projects and studies, and providing direction on
programmatic changes, WRDAs better enable the Corps to continue working
to achieve its key civil works missions. Since 2014, Congress has
enacted a WRDA bill every two years with strong bipartisan support.
This consistency over the last decade has allowed Congress to respond
to local water resource needs more effectively. It also imparts
confidence that we can address water infrastructure needs that may
arise in the future, regardless of partisan discord in Washington.
Through these bipartisan bills, Congress has authorized new
projects and studies across the country. We've also streamlined
processes at the Corps, improved project delivery, expanded
opportunities for non-federal project sponsors to develop and execute
water resource projects, and enhanced the Corps' ability to respond to
emergencies and disasters, to name a few.
For my district, in WRDA 2022, we were able to authorize the North
Carolina National Coastal Mapping Study to map inland and coastal
waterways and identify potential hazards, such as debris and
sedimentation, which can lead to increased flood risk. This study will
lead the way in a larger nationwide effort to invest in flood
resilience, and I am pleased funding for such was included in the House
Energy and Water Appropriations bill.
Additionally, it's important to emphasize that the success of
previous WRDAs is due in large part to the strong participation from
Democrat and Republican member offices, coordination with the Corps,
and constructive feedback from non-federal partners and other
stakeholders. I am proud to have played a role in many of those bills
and look forward to continuing this bipartisan tradition with WRDA
2024.
In that spirit, we are very pleased to have Assistant Secretary
Connor and Lieutenant General Spellmon here before the Subcommittee
today to discuss their efforts to implement WRDA 2022 and other
priorities as we move towards WRDA 2024.

Mr. Rouzer. I now recognize my great friend and colleague,
Ranking Member Napolitano, for 5 minutes for her opening
statement.
Mrs. Napolitano.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO OF CALIFORNIA,
RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON WATER RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT

Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you for your kind words and for holding today's hearing.
Through the biennial enactment of Water Resources
Development Acts, WRDA, this committee is addressing the water-
related needs of our States and local communities. All the
WRDAs are a shining example of how Congress can efficiently and
effectively meet the bipartisan needs of our communities when
we decide that we can work together rather than apart.
I look forward to continuing my relationship with you, Mr.
Chairman, with Chairman Graves, and Ranking Member Larsen to
get it done. I also want to thank Assistant Secretary Connor
and General Spellmon for their testimony, and I also want to
give a welcome to Mr. Connor's daughter, Gabriela.
The Corps plays a critical role in addressing the water
resources challenges of the Nation, protecting our communities
from flooding, restoring our environment and ecosystems, and
maintaining our Nation's economy by supporting ports and
harbors.
Timely implementation of past WRDA provisions can help make
communities more resilient to stronger storms and higher seas
and, of course, longer droughts. And this is especially true
related to the water supply and water conservation needs of
this country.
Over the past decade, I have championed several provisions
to enhance the WRDA authority and flexibility of the Corps to
address the local water supply and water conservation needs
while balancing the efforts with other authorized purposes of
Corps projects.
For too long, we have seen the Corps revert back to the
position that water supply and water conservation are not
primary missions of the Corps, meaning that these objectives do
not get the same attention and budgetary priority as other
mission areas.
The Corps restates that arbitrary stance in its report on
water supply and conservation that I requested in WRDA 2020 and
was submitted to Congress in September. I ask unanimous consent
that this report be included as part of today's hearing record.
Mr. Rouzer. Without objection.
[The information follows:]

Report, ``Water Resources Development Act of 2020, Section 221--Study
on Water Supply and Water Conservation at Water Resources Development
Projects,'' by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, August 2023, Submitted for
the Record by Hon. Grace F. Napolitano
The 22-page report is retained in committee files and is available
online at https://usace.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getfile/collection/
p16021coll5/id/37142.

Mrs. Napolitano. Mr. Chairman, much of the country is now
facing similar water supply challenges that we have long felt
in the West. In my view, that necessitates rethinking the role
the Corps can play to help communities facing water
insecurity--not to supplant State and local water efforts, but
to support them.
If the Corps or the Office of Management and Budget is
using arbitrary, policy-level factors to shut down the
consideration of congressionally authorized water supply and
water conservation elements in water resources projects, we
should all be concerned. If the Corps or OMB is using
artificial barriers to exclude from consideration worthy
projects with substantial State and local support, then
Congress needs to revisit how authorized water supply and water
conservation elements are ranked among the historic priorities
and missions of the Corps. This is an issue that I have
followed for a long time and something I want to continue to
discuss with stakeholders and partners in Congress as we
develop a new WRDA bill for 2024.
We will all see on the news the challenges of dividing up
the Colorado River water and efforts made by the States and the
Federal Government to find solutions for the future. With water
supply as mission area, the Corps should be part of the
solution as well.
In WRDA 2022, Congress also authorized provisions to ensure
the Corps was forward-thinking in addressing the challenges of
climate change. For example, I coauthored the Managed Aquifer
Recharge Study--that is a word--to direct the Corps to conduct
a national assessment of managed aquifer recharge projects.
WRDA 2022 also directed the Corps to prioritize the update
of water control manuals--my favorite subject--for the Corps'
projects that include water supply or water conservation as
authorized purposes. These are commonsense measures that help
States like California prepare for the world of climate change
and severe drought.
I am also particularly thankful that in WRDA 2022, we were
able to make a commitment to address the needs of Tribal and
disadvantaged communities, building on similar provisions from
2020. Full implementation of these provisions is critical to
address legacy challenges faced by Tribal and disadvantaged
communities in seeking assistance or partnering with the Corps
to address local water resource challenges.
The Corps has great resources and technical expertise, and
we must ensure that all communities are able to access their
assistance.
Mr. Chairman, this is a WRDA which will be the sixth
biennial bill since the committee returned to regular passage
of WRDA bills in 2014. I look forward to continuing to work
with you and all of our bipartisan colleagues on another
successful WRDA this Congress.
And I yield back.
[Mrs. Napolitano's prepared statement follows:]

This is an issue that I have followed for a very long time, and
something I continue to discuss with stakeholders and partners in

Mr. Chairman, the last few WRDAs included significant policy wins
for how the Corps develops and implements projects.
For example, in WRDA 2022, Congress directed the Corps to be more
forward-thinking in addressing the challenge of climate change.
For example, I co-authored the Managed Aquifer Recharge Study to
direct the Corps to conduct a national assessment of managed aquifer
recharge projects.
WRDA 2022 also directed the Corps to prioritize the update of water
control manuals for Corps' projects that include water supply or water

I am also particularly thankful that in WRDA 2022 we were able to
make a commitment to address the needs of tribal and disadvantaged
communities, building on similar provisions from WRDA 2020. Fully
incorporating these changes into the Corps' culture is critical to
address the historic challenges faced by Tribal and disadvantaged
communities in working with the Corps.
The Corps has great resources and technical expertise, and we must
ensure that all communities are able to access their assistance.
Mr. Chairman, the next WRDA would be the sixth biennial bill since
the Committee returned to regular passage of WRDA bills in 2014. Last
Congress, we worked together with friendship and collegiality through
hearings and meetings for a bipartisan accomplishment.
I look forward to working with you on another successful WRDA this
Congress.
Let's get to work, and I yield back.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentlelady.
I now recognize the ranking member of the full committee,
Mr. Larsen, for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair, thank you,
Ranking Member Napolitano, for holding this hearing. I want to
welcome back the panel as well, and thanks for your flexibility
in coming back.
Since 2014, this committee has honored its commitment to
meet local water resource needs around the country, carried out
by the Army Corps through the bipartisan and biennial enactment
of the Water Resources Development Acts. Predictable WRDA
enactment supports projects that address local water resource
challenges, creating jobs in construction and supporting
industries and the businesses that benefit directly from Corps'
projects.
Regular enactment of WRDAs also allows for the
implementation of critical and timely policy reforms that
improve the function and flexibility of the Corps to respond to
local water resources challenges, including section 214, of
which I will have a question for you on its implementation.
WRDA 2022 provides a good blueprint for future WRDAs. This
legislation successfully authorized the construction of 25 new
projects covering every facet of the Corps' missions, as well
as almost 100 new feasibility studies for future water resource
development projects.
WRDA 2022 also authorized a historic total of more than
$6.5 billion in environmental infrastructure assistance for
community-driven projects, including $200 million for water and
wastewater infrastructure requested by local officials in
western Washington State. These Federal, State, and local
partnerships are critical to help address the growing water and
wastewater infrastructure needs throughout the country.
Lastly, WRDA 2022 continued to expand America's
navigational capacity, strengthen its supply chains, ensure our
communities are resilient to the challenges posed by climate
change, and increase the coordination between the Corps and
Tribal, minority, and economically disadvantaged communities.
Beyond the regular enactment of WRDAs, Congress also needs
to provide sufficient funding for project planning,
construction, and operation and maintenance so communities can
quickly realize the benefits of water resource improvements.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a great example of how
this should work. The BIL provided a massive downpayment, a
total of about $17 billion, for critical WRDA projects. The
Corps has shown exactly how and where they spent that money.
Nearly all of it has been allocated. These BIL dollars are hard
at work, making a positive im--American jobs--and the U.S.
economy.
Now the Congress must ensure the seamless implementation of
critical water resource development projects while providing
the Corps with sufficient funds to carry out its missions.
So, I look forward to the continued partnership with Chair
Graves, Chair Rouzer, and Ranking Member Napolitano as well, in
developing a new bipartisan WRDA 2024. And I welcome the
leadership of the Corps here today as part of that discussion.
With that, I yield back.
[Mr. Larsen of Washington's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen, a Representative in Congress

bipartisan WRDA 2024, and welcome the leadership of the Corps here
today as part of that discussion.

Mr. Rouzer. I thank the gentleman.
I would now like to again welcome our witnesses. I really
appreciate you coming back today. Your testimony is critically
important to us as we move forward.
So, we have the Honorable Michael L. Connor, Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, and then, of course,
Lieutenant General Scott Spellmon, Chief of Engineers and
Commanding General of the United States Army Corps of
Engineers.
So, we all are familiar with the lighting system. I won't
belabor that. Obviously, green means go, yellow means running
out of time, and red means try to conclude your remarks.
And a little advisory to the Members. I anticipate we are
going to have a number of Members come today representing both
sides of the aisle, and to make sure we can accommodate
everybody in a timely manner, try to keep your questions to 5
minutes. And if you ask a final question with no time left, I
am going to gavel you down, so, just know that upfront. So,
think about how many questions you have and how long it takes
to get them answered, and use your time to your best advantage.
I ask unanimous consent the witnesses' full statements be
included in the record.
Without objection, so ordered.
I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing
remain open until such time as our witnesses have provided
answers to any questions that may be submitted to them in
writing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 days for any additional comments and information
submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in the record
of today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
As your written testimony has been made part of the record,
the subcommittee asks that you, the witnesses, limit your oral
remarks to 5 minutes.
With that, Assistant Secretary Connor, you are recognized
for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. MICHAEL L. CONNOR, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE
ARMY FOR CIVIL WORKS, DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY; AND LIEUTENANT
GENERAL SCOTT A. SPELLMON, CHIEF OF ENGINEERS AND COMMANDING
GENERAL, U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS

TESTIMONY OF HON. MICHAEL L. CONNOR, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE
ARMY FOR CIVIL WORKS, DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY

Mr. Connor. Thank you.
Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, distinguished
committee members, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the
implementation of WRDA 2022 and the administration's priorities
for WRDA 2024.
The Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works program is the
Nation's largest water resources program. It serves three
primary missions: flood and storm damage risk reduction,
commercial navigation, and aquatic ecosystem restoration. The
program also addresses a host of other missions authorized and
funded by Congress, including regulatory permitting,
recreation, hydropower production, water supply, disaster
response, and radiological cleanup, the FUSRAP program.
This is a massive set of responsibilities, and the Civil
Works program contributes significantly towards the Nation's
well-being, supporting the economy, and protecting and
improving the lives of Americans. We appreciate the substantial
resources now in hand through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
disaster supplementals and annual appropriations to advance the
President's Investing in America agenda.
The water resources challenges of today and tomorrow are
not like those of yesterday. Climate change-driven weather
extremes are increasingly the norm, creating risk to
communities, the economy, and natural systems. As a result, the
Army's Civil Works program needs to continue to evolve,
modernize, and partner with sponsors and communities in
different ways to effectively meet its mission responsibilities
and new challenges.
We look forward to working closely with Congress in
developing the next WRDA to ensure we have the tools,
processes, and resources in place to, one, better assess risks
and innovate our approach to effectively address those risks;
two, improve our processes to appropriately and equitably serve
a broader set of communities; and three, develop projects for
consideration by Congress that provide multiple benefits, have
community acceptance, and include well-developed cost
estimates.
Before elaborating on evolving needs, we know the community
is focused on implementation of recent WRDAs. Following the
passage of WRDA 2022, the Army and Corps of Engineers gathered
public input on implementation of its provisions. Army Civil
Works and the Corps are developing implementation guidance for
12 of those provisions. In the past week, I finalized and
signed three of those guidance documents.
There are also several provisions in WRDA 2022 to address
droughts. I will continue to work with the Corps to develop
meaningful near-term activities to address drought-related
issues while advancing long-term drought resilience. We are in
the water availability business even while others provide
direct supply.
I should note that drought is not just an issue impacting
the arid West. This is the second year in a row the Mississippi
River has experienced extreme low water due to severe drought
across parts of the central United States. The Corps has been
continually dredging to keep the channel open in the
Mississippi River for safe navigation to support the Nation's
supply chains. We have also been working closely with the State
of Louisiana to provide emergency drinking water systems for
the State's southern residents impacted by saltwater intrusion
as a result of those low flows.
Now, as we look to a WRDA 2024, the Corps is committed to
help communities improve their resilience to the evolving set
of challenges we see in water resources management. Key tools
include our technical assistance programs and water resources
projects, and it goes without saying that much of the Army's
work can only be accomplished through a foundation of
partnerships between the Corps and local communities, as well
as the States.
As highlighted earlier, the Army is committed to advancing
the President's Investing in America agenda, including
advancing environmental justice and delivering on the Justice40
initiative to ensure Federal investment funds are provided to
marginalized communities impacted by years of underinvestment.
The Corps has increased partner engagement through its Planning
Assistance to States, Flood Plain Management Services, and
Tribal Partnership Program, as well as studies for flood and
coastal storm risk management and aquatic ecosystem
restoration.
My office is also working to improve our nation-to-nation
consultations to ensure Tribal nations have meaningful
involvement on Federal actions which affect their interests. We
welcome the tools provided in recent WRDAs to make better use
of these programs and will continue to be engaged with Congress
as new needs emerge.
I will also continue to implement innovative and modernized
authorities to carry out measures to address sea level rise,
beneficial use of dredge material, natural and nature-based
solutions, and deliver on the growing demand for environmental
infrastructure and multipurpose projects.
Thank you for the opportunity. I look forward to addressing
your questions.
[Mr. Connor's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Michael L. Connor, Assistant Secretary of
the Army for Civil Works, Department of the Army
Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, and distinguished
members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here
today to discuss the implementation of the Water Resources Development
Act (WRDA) of 2022 and the Army's priorities for WRDA 2024.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works Program is the
Nation's largest water resources program. It serves three main
missions: flood and storm damage reduction, commercial navigation, and
aquatic ecosystem restoration. The Civil Works Program also addresses a
host of other water resource and infrastructure needs as authorized and
funded by Congress. Our civil works projects have contributed
significantly toward the Nation's well-being, supporting the economy
and protecting and improving the lives of Americans with innovative
water management processes to facilitate commercial navigation and
address flood risk and drought.
The Army works with our Nation's coastal ports to maintain their
channels; operates and maintains the inland waterways of commerce;
supports Tribal, state, and local flood and coastal storm damage risk
management reduction activities; restores significant aquatic
ecosystems; and operates and maintains multipurpose dams, as well as
the reservoirs behind them. There are about 250 million day-visits a
year for recreation at Corps' lands and reservoirs, making the Corps
one of the top Federal recreation providers.
The infrastructure that the Army maintains includes 13,000 miles of
coastal navigation channels (including the channels of the Great
Lakes), 12,000 miles of inland waterways, 715 dams, 241 locks at 195
navigation sites, 14,700 miles of levees, and hydropower plants at 75
locations with 353 generating units. These projects help provide risk
reduction from flooding in our river valleys and along our coasts,
facilitate the movement of approximately two billion tons of waterborne
commerce, and provide up to 24 percent of the Nation's hydropower.
It's important to note that the water resources challenges of today
and tomorrow are not like those of yesterday. Weather extremes are
increasingly the norm, creating risk to communities, the economy, and
natural systems. As a result, understanding vulnerabilities and
increasing our preparedness is of paramount importance.
Following the passage of WRDA 2022, and as required by WRDA 2014,
the Army and the Corps held a 60-day public comment period as well as
four listening sessions, one which was focused on Tribal Leaders, to
gather input on implementation of all provisions. Army Civil Works and
the Corps are developing implementation guidance for 12 provisions and
working with appropriate Corps teams to guide implementation of project
specific provisions, such as Section 8155 (Continuation of
Construction) and Section 8106 (Scope of Feasibility Studies) of WRDA
2022. The implementation guidance is in the final stages of review, and
I anticipate issuing the guidance soon.
Through the 94 feasibility studies and 25 construction projects
authorized in WRDA 2022, the Corps can continue to address water
resources challenges and critical infrastructure needs within the
commercial navigation, flood and storm damage reduction, and aquatic
ecosystem restoration mission areas.
WRDA 2022 also calls for the standing up of four federal advisory
groups to the Secretary. The groups include:

Managed Aquifer Recharge Working Group (Section 8108)

Tribal and Economically Disadvantaged Communities
Advisory Committee (Section 8115)

Non-Federal Interests Advisory Committee (Section 8150)

Western Water Cooperative Committee (Section 8158)

To date, significant progress has been made in developing the plans
to stand-up the committees. Three advisory committees have been
identified by the Department of Defense (DoD) as being subject to the
Federal Advisory Committee Act and a determination on the fourth
committee is under DoD review.
I recognize the opportunities provided through WRDA 2022 to address
drought, and I will continue to work with the Corps to develop
meaningful near-term activities to address drought-related issues while
advancing long-term drought resilience through robust forward-thinking
actions. This legislation strengthens the Nation's capabilities and
challenges posed by drought. This is the second year the Mississippi
River has experienced severe low water after a summer of intense heat
and lower-than-average rainfall which has triggered drought across
parts of the central U.S. The Corps is working to keep the channel open
for safe navigation to support the Nation's economy and maintain a
robust supply chain to move goods to market.
Also, Section 8311 (Acequias Irrigation Systems) of WRDA 2022
changes the non-Federal cost share for a Tribal community as well as
supports research, development, and training for innovative management
solutions, including those for controlling invasive aquatic plants that
affect acequias. This will ensure greater resiliency and address
threats from changing hydrological and climatic conditions.
As we look to a WRDA for 2024, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is
committed to the national effort to help communities improve their
resilience to extreme weather events, through its technical assistance
programs and water resources projects, a mission of increasing
importance with our changing climate. Much of the Army's work can only
be accomplished through a foundation of partnerships between the Corps
and local communities, which allow us to work together to help develop,
manage, restore, and protect the Nation's water resources and the
environment.
Moving forward, my priorities are:

to maintain the Nation's inland waterways and coastal
ports to support supply chains and economic growth,

to build innovative, climate-resilient infrastructure to
reduce risk to communities and aquatic ecosystems,

to modernize the civil works' programs to better serve
the needs of our Nation, including tribal and disadvantaged
communities,

to invest in research and development to deliver water
resource solutions, and

strengthen communications and relationships to solve
water resource challenges.

The Administration is focused on developing and implementing
programs and projects that increase infrastructure and ecosystem
resilience to climate change and decrease climate risk for communities
based on the best available science and promoting environmental justice
for disadvantaged, underserved, tribal and rural communities and
creating good paying jobs that provide the free and fair chance to join
a union and collectively bargain. We believe in smart investments that
maximize the resiliency and durability of our water management
resources; moving into a more sustainable posture by investing in
infrastructure that delivers benefits across our Nation. This can be
accomplished through authorizations that address the effects of climate
change.
Through the President's Investing in America agenda, the Army Corps
of Engineers is advancing environmental justice and delivering on the
Justice-40 Initiative, which is focused on ensuring 40 percent of the
overall benefits of certain federal investments are reaching
disadvantaged communities that have been marginalized by years of
underinvestment. The Corps has increased stakeholder engagement through
its Planning Assistance to States, Floodplain Management Services, and
the Tribal Partnership Program, as well as areas such as studies for
flood and coastal storm risk management and aquatic ecosystem
restoration. My office is also working to improve our Nation-to-Nation
consultations to ensure Tribal Nations have meaningful involvement on
federal actions which have Tribal implications. We are also making a
concerted effort to strengthen our Tribal relationships through
partnerships in programs and projects, especially under the Tribal
Partnership Program. I issued a policy clarification memorandum to the
Corps to ensure they deliver the Tribal Partnership Program to the
fullest extent allowed under the current authority. My office recently
hosted webinars with Tribes and engaged in consultation to discuss our
efforts and why we are developing comprehensive guidance on the
program.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has advanced actions to promote
climate resilience and environmental justice and strengthening the
supply chain. These investments are helping Americans in many
communities across the Nation.
The Corps Water Infrastructure Financing Program (CWIFP) will
enable local investment in non-federal dam safety infrastructure by
offering credit assistance in the form of direct loans and loan
guarantees for non-federal dam safety projects to maintain, upgrade and
repair dams identified in the National Inventory of Dams. Priority will
be given to projects serving economically disadvantaged communities
through fee waivers and project financing up to 80% of the total
project costs. This is a significant milestone for the Corps and
represents a new and innovative way for the Army to support the
Nation's investment in infrastructure.
I also am working to support local efforts to respond and adapt to
sea-level rise, and to increase the beneficial use dredged material and
incorporate natural and nature-based solutions where appropriate.
In closing, the Army Civil Works Program is using its significant
capabilities in an equitable manner to address longstanding
environmental justice concerns; boost the Nation's economy through
navigation; and tackle climate change impacts.
Thank you, Chairman Rouzer, Chairwoman Napolitano and Committee
Members. I look forward to answering any questions you or other Members
of the Committee may have.

Mr. Rouzer. Thank you.
General Spellmon.

TESTIMONY OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL SCOTT A. SPELLMON, CHIEF OF
ENGINEERS AND COMMANDING GENERAL, U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS

General Spellmon. Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member
Napolitano, Ranking Member Larsen, and distinguished members of
the subcommittee, I am honored to testify before you today, and
thank you for the opportunity to discuss implementation of past
Water Resources Development Acts and future water resources
needs.
This past fiscal year, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
obligated $40.7 billion, $18 billion of which went to
implementing our Civil Works mission. This is the second
highest program year in our 249-year history, and this could
not have happened without the tools and authorities given to us
by this committee and Congress.
I believe we have good momentum heading into fiscal year
2024 as well. For example, the Everglades program, we
anticipate awarding over $1 billion into restoration work for
fiscal year 2024. On the research and development front, we are
working to enhance our knowledge in new and powerful
technologies, such as crowdsourced bathymetry, and achieving a
better understanding of the sources and control for events like
harmful algal blooms, and many, many other initiatives.
Specifically, we want to thank this committee for
authorization of an R&D account for the Corps. Many other
Federal agencies enjoy this benefit, and once this is in place,
it will bring greater transparency, cohesion, and much more
visibility to our research and development efforts in the Corps
and to the Army's overarching modernization efforts.
In our regulatory program, we currently employ 1,300 staff
members. In fiscal year 2023, these professionals processed
just over 43,000 section 10 and 404 permits. We rendered just
under 32,000 of those permit decisions, or 74 percent of them,
on time. We know that is not good enough.
We continue to seek ways to improve our metrics with
further investments in our regulatory viewer and regulatory
request system. These improvements will help applicants better
understand permitting requirements and assist our regulators in
their field analysis so they can make more timely and efficient
decisions.
I want to thank the subcommittee for your continued support
of the Civil Works program. Your commitment to passing biennial
WRDAs since 2014 has provided the authorizations and tools
necessary to advance our Civil Works mission and enable
critical policy transformations to address the Nation's
changing water resource infrastructure needs.
In WRDA 2022, Congress authorized 25 new construction
projects, 94 new feasibility studies, and 131 new environmental
infrastructure projects. When funded, these initiatives will
strengthen the supply chain, address the changing climatic
conditions we are seeing across our project footprints, advance
environmental justice, invest in Tribal nations, and provide
much-needed water resource projects to traditionally
underserved communities.
WRDA 2022 and prior WRDA authorizations, as well as the
2024 budget and other recent funding, provides the Corps with
what the Secretary calls a transformational opportunity to
deliver water resource infrastructure projects that will
positively impact communities across our great Nation. I am
confident WRDA 2024 will build on this progress.
I will conclude by saying that we do not accomplish
anything on our own. Delivering successful Civil Works projects
is a shared responsibility with our non-Federal sponsors,
project stakeholders, and Congress. In other words, it is a
team sport. I look forward to continuing our great
collaboration as we face the challenges of today and tomorrow.
Thank you again, Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member
Napolitano, Ranking Member Larsen, and members of the
subcommittee. I look forward to answering your questions.
[General Spellmon's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Lieutenant General Scott A. Spellmon, Chief of
Engineers and Commanding General, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, and distinguished
members of the Subcommittee. I am honored to testify before you today
along with the Honorable Michael Connor, Assistant Secretary of the
Army for Civil Works, regarding implementation of previous Water
Resources Development Acts (WRDA) and future water infrastructure
needs. Most importantly, I look forward to continuing to work with this
committee, the Congress, and the Administration to help address the
Nation's water resources challenges.
Through the Army Civil Works program, the United States Army Corps
of Engineers (Corps) works with other Federal agencies, States, Tribes,
and local governments, as well as others, to develop, manage, restore,
and protect water resources, primarily through the study, construction,
and operation and maintenance of water-related infrastructure projects.
The Corps also regulates development affecting waters of the United
States, including wetlands, and works with other Federal agencies to
help communities respond to, and recover from, floods and other natural
disasters.
The authorizations and funding provided to us by Congress will
allow us to advance our three main missions of commercial navigation,
flood and storm damage reduction, and aquatic ecosystem restoration, as
well as support related project purposes, such as water supply,
hydropower, and recreation. The Civil Works program is performance-
based and focuses on high-performing projects and programs within these
three main mission areas. The Corps uses its engineering expertise and
relationships with project sponsors and stakeholders to develop
innovative approaches to address some of the most pressing water
resources challenges facing the Nation. Since 2014, the WRDA has
provided the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with biennial authorizations
to advance the Corps Civil Works missions by enabling critical policy
transformations to address the changing needs of the Nation's water
resources infrastructure.
WRDA 2022 provided the Corps the flexibility to design projects
that respond to a wider suite of impacts associated with climate
change. WRDA 2022 also provided flexibility to address the water
resources needs of urban and rural communities with environmental
justice concerns. This is a high priority goal of the Administration.
An important next step for Army Civil Works will be the adoption of
procedures implementing the Water Resources Principles, Requirements,
and Guidelines. In partnership with the Assistant Secretary for Army
for Civil Works, we expect to formally initiate a rulemaking process on
this issue later this year. This rulemaking will include a focus on
securing environmental justice and spurring economic opportunity for
disadvantaged communities that have been historically marginalized,
underserved, or overburdened by pollution, and may have been left
behind in the past in terms of infrastructure development.
The Corps Tribal Nations Program enables the Army to partner with
Federally recognized American Indian and Alaskan Native tribal
governments to identify solutions to their water resources challenges,
which will substantially benefit the people who live in Indian Country
or in Alaska Native villages. The Corps works with Native American
Tribes as cost-share partners on Civil Works projects through its
Tribal Partnership Program, under its Planning Assistance to States
Program, as well as through specifically authorized Civil Works
projects. WRDA 2022 supports our trust commitment to Tribal Nations by
enhancing the breadth and reach of the Tribal Partnership Program,
strengthening tools to provide Tribal assistance, as well as
establishing a framework for an advisory committee to further
facilitate delivery of water resources projects to Tribal Nations. The
Corps reaffirms its commitment to engage in regular, meaningful, and
robust consultation with Tribal officials in the development of water
resources projects and on regulatory actions that have Tribal
implications.
WRDA 2022 also included an authorization for the Army Civil Works
research and development (R&D) program. Through R&D, we are making
investments to tackle future water resources challenges and advance
related technological development in support of the three Army Civil
Works main missions. This investment demonstrates the Administration's
commitment to engineering innovation to deliver enduring water resource
solutions for the Nation. This investment will allow the Corps to
continue addressing the most pressing knowledge gaps that our
practitioners face while doing their jobs in the field, such as
operational, data-driven methods to improve navigation channel
maintenance, the beneficial use of dredged material, and flood and
storm risk management modeling. Investments proposed by the President's
Budget for Fiscal Year 2024 include funding to advance longer-term
research and development by accelerating the Forecast-Informed
Reservoir Operations Assessment, which will further our understanding
of atmospheric river impacts on flood risk management, water supply,
and other water uses; as well as funding to inform and improve our
overall asset management strategy, with a focus on work that has the
potential to achieve significant cost savings in the Civil Works
program. Knowledge gained by the further development of such water
management tools and strategies will inform the Corps' ability to
respond to severe climatologic conditions, including adaptation for sea
level rise and persistent drought.
In September 2023, we issued our Notice of Funding Availability for
the Corps Water Infrastructure Financing Program authorized under the
Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014. This program allows
the Corps to accelerate non-federal investments in water resources
infrastructure by providing direct loans and loan guarantees to
creditworthy borrowers in order to maintain, upgrade, and repair non-
federal dams. It is the Corps' first ever loan program and enables
local investment in infrastructure projects that enhance community
resilience to flooding, promote economic prosperity, and improve
environmental quality.
WRDA 2022 also represents Congress's continued commitment to the
communities you serve by authorizing numerous projects and studies,
including those within your districts. Congress authorized 25
construction projects, 94 feasibility studies, and 131 New
Environmental Infrastructure projects. Through our studies and
projects, the Corps evaluates the benefits and costs of options to
strengthen the supply chain, address the climate crisis, advance
environmental justice, invest in Tribal Nations, and assist
traditionally underserved communities.
My top priorities include identifying the highest priority
potential investments for the Army Civil Works Program, starting with
the maintenance of our existing infrastructure, and ensuring that we
deliver studies and finish quality projects safely, on time, and within
budget. I am focused on delivering projects that will contribute to the
effort to enhance the Nation's resilience to climate change. These
priorities will ensure a better return on taxpayer investment and
improve the lives of all Americans.
Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and Members of the Subcommittee. This
concludes my statement. I appreciate the opportunity to testify today
and look forward to answering any questions you may have. Thank you.

Mr. Rouzer. Well, thank you both for being here again, and
thank you very much for your testimony.
We will now turn to questions for the panel, and I
recognize myself for 5 minutes.
Mr. Connor, first, before I get into WRDA, I want to touch
base quickly on WOTUS. We continue to hear concerns from
stakeholders on the lack of clarity from the Corps on
implementation of the revised WOTUS definition. I am aware the
Corps, along with EPA, recently published some additional
guidance. And although the Sackett decision emphasizes
relatively permanent waters, it remains quite unclear how this
new rule will be interpreted regarding ephemeral streams.
Does the Corps plan to provide additional clarification on
this? And if so, when would that be?
Mr. Connor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are now back in the
jurisdictional determination business with the issue, and so,
the conforming rule as of September 8. So, the first stage of
the implementation aspect of the conforming rule is to move
forward and start making those jurisdictional determinations. I
believe we have made 631 approved JDs since the issuance of the
rule. We have got a backlog of over 4,000.
Those processes are informing what will ultimately be a
guidance process, which I think is what you just asked
specifically about. Will we have guidance ultimately on
implementing continuous surface connection? Yes, we will, but
right now, the focus is on working through those jurisdictional
determinations.
Most of them that have been done haven't been
controversial, haven't resulted in any significant discussion
between ourselves and the Environmental Protection Agency. Some
of them are. And that is going to inform us as we further
define what the Supreme Court meant through the continuous
surface connection test.
So, bottom line to all of that is: Jurisdictional
determinations first, do our lessons learned, continue to
engage with the public, and then look as we get into next year
doing guidance documents. That is the game plan as it exists
right now.
Mr. Rouzer. Well, wouldn't the jurisdictional
determinations be determinant based on your guidance at the
national level rather than the other way around?
Mr. Connor. It's a chicken or the egg type of situation,
Mr. Chairman. I think we will apply the test, go through as it
was laid out. It's pretty much a new test that the Supreme
Court has provided us in the Sackett decision. So, we need to
dissect all the elements of that opinion as we go through those
jurisdictional determinations and inform ourselves as we seek
more long-term guidance.
Mr. Rouzer. Well, it sounds like very muddy water to me,
but I have got to move on.
The committee is currently in receipt of three Chief's
Reports. The committee has not yet received any Post-
Authorization Change Reports from the Corps. How many Chief's
Reports and PACRs should we expect for potential inclusion in
the 2024 WRDA?
General Spellmon. Mr. Chairman, we are on track to submit
15 Chief's Reports for Congress' consideration in WRDA 2024 and
1 Post-Authorization Change Report.
Mr. Rouzer. Well, as you know, we really need those in
order to do our work and do it properly.
Mr. Connor, Surf City, North Carolina, is currently waiting
to begin a critical beach nourishment project that has been
long overdue, as you know, and will serve to protect this
coastal community for decades to come. The Chief's Report for
Surf City and North Topsail Beach project was completed in
2010. It was authorized in WRRDA 2014. Project construction was
funded through the 2019 Disaster Relief Act. Topsail Beach
ended up withdrawing from the project in 2021, triggering the
need to authorize a new Surf City-only project in order to use
those 2019 funds.
Currently, investigations funds that would ultimately lead
to construction are waiting for your approval. When can we
expect Surf City to get this funding and move forward?
Mr. Connor. Yes, Mr. Chairman. We need to make a decision
with respect to Surf City. We are going through that process
within the administration. It's time to ensure that we have the
resources to do the general reevaluation report.
So, I will go back and make sure that there is clarity that
we need to get those funds to move forward. So, hopefully in
the very near future, I can provide you the specific answer to
your question about specifically when.
Mr. Rouzer. Well, I think, as we all know, every day that
these projects are delayed is another day that these
communities are at risk, particularly coastal communities. We
saw that when Hurricane Ian hit Wrightsville Beach last year.
And I know you are both very familiar with Wrightsville Beach,
and I greatly appreciate your work to help get that issue
straightened out, but that renourishment should have been done
2 years ago. And so, we must take seriously the timeliness of
these requests and the need to continue protecting the life and
property of our coastal areas and our coastal citizens.
With that, I have 2 seconds left. My time has expired.
I will now yield to Mrs. Napolitano.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Assistant Secretary Connor, when you last appeared before
the subcommittee, I asked you about the implementation of the
set-aside for 12 percent of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund
for donor ports from the WRDA 2020 bill, yet there has been no
action on this issue.
The authority for expanded use of donor ports is of
critical importance to me and the ports in my region in Los
Angeles and Long Beach. The ports of L.A. and Long Beach
collect over $200 million a year in harbor maintenance funds
but only receive 5 percent back for their projects. Incredibly
unfair, and that is why we negotiated improvements for donor
ports in WRDA 2020.
What is the Corps doing to address the inequity and follow
Congress' direction regarding targets set in WRDA 2020 for
donor ports?
Mr. Connor. Thank you, Ranking Member Napolitano. I don't
know that I have had a discussion of any issue more than I have
with respect to donor ports, so, I recognize the importance
across both the House and the Senate with respect to the
interest in that provision and the provisions of WRDA 2020 that
were negotiated and enacted into law.
So, the answer to your question is we did not include
funding in our 2024 budget for donor ports. That was the one
part of the 2020 legislation that was left out. We understand
the importance it has to you and a whole host of other Members.
So, we have solicited from those donor ports their needs, how
they would use funding. We want to be prepared should there be
workplan money in 2024 that we can look to, allocate resources
towards some of those needs, and we certainly have this under
consideration given its priority for Congress as we develop our
next 2025 budget.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you.
In the water supply and water conservation report submitted
to Congress in September, the Corps highlights that, regardless
of congressional authorization, ``priority would remain
primarily with core authority areas for flood risk management,
aquatic ecosystem restoration, and navigation, rather than
water supply, water conservation and other allied purposes.''
With all the potential benefits of enhanced water
conservation efforts, can this internal budgetary
prioritization result in potentially beneficial water supply
actions not being pursued?
Mr. Connor. Ranking Member, I think we are pursuing water
supply in many different ways, and I think important ways. So,
a few examples I will just identify real quickly. As I
mentioned to you, looking at our projects for the variety of
benefits that they can provide is incredibly important. We
can't just do a flood control project without thinking of water
supply and environmental restoration.
We recently did that, as an example of what I mentioned to
you earlier, which is, we have Prado Dam and Whittier Narrows
Dam as flood control projects. Earlier this past year, we had
this strange event in August, Hurricane Hilary, that was coming
up the west coast. We were prepared to do significant flood
control actions.
It ended up being a little bit of a lesser storm, so, we
pivoted and we operated under our deviations for Prado and
Whittier Narrows, and we turned it into a water supply event,
where we metered out the water that did come in so we could
provide it to the local providers for their managed aquifer
recharge systems, 19,000 acre-feet that they stored
underground.
That is an example of how we can think about holistically
our projects in a way that we are ensuring we are doing all we
can to enhance water availability so that water suppliers can
ensure that they have drought resilience in their systems.
We are going to continue to have water supply contracts. We
are looking in other places that are drought stricken how we
can get water under contract that is not currently under
contract but through environmental restoration, flood control/
water supply/managed aquifer recharge, as well as direct
contracts. I think we have got an array of tools to address
water supply, and that is a priority for the Corps of
Engineers.
Mrs. Napolitano. Is the dredging part of it so that there
would be more catch, dredging of the dams?
Mr. Connor. I am sorry. Can you repeat the question?
Mrs. Napolitano. Well, we have long known that sometimes
the dams get sediment, and the dredging is part of keeping them
ready for more captured water. My question is: Where are we in
the projects with the dam dredging?
Mr. Connor. I believe there was an authorization in WRDA
2022 with respect to looking at the prospects of removing
sediment. I am not sure exactly where we are, other than I
think we are preparing if we have resources to undertake that
study.
General Spellmon?
General Spellmon. Ma'am, real quick. I will tell you, we
are about to take to the Secretary--another example, to just
highlight what Mr. Connor mentioned, reallocation studies. So,
we have got a great one here for Stockton Lake in Missouri we
will take to the Secretary in March. We are finalizing our data
now. And just some really new R&D initiatives to help us better
understand sedimentation in our reservoirs.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you very much.
I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentlelady yields back.
Mr. Webster, you are recognized.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
A lot of things have been discussed about the availability
of products and so forth because of the supply chain, and I
know navigation and freeing channels and so forth is an
important part of that, I believe it is, to move the cargo.
What are the highest challenges that you face--I ask this
to the lieutenant general--in the mission that you have to
improve that navigation? What would be the, I don't know,
biggest challenges?
General Spellmon. Yes, sir. I will start out by saying I am
responsible for maintaining 577 Federal navigation channels
across the country at 1,208 ports. The funding and authorities
that this committee and Congress have given us have been
extremely helpful. We greatly appreciate, I will add, the
provision that allows increased draws from the Harbor
Maintenance Trust Fund to allow us to get after more channels
and, specifically, more low-use channels.
This year, at the end of fiscal year 2023, the Harbor
Maintenance Trust Fund had an end-of-year balance of $10.3
billion, and we appreciate Congress' direction to allow us to
have increased draws on that account moving forward.
Mr. Webster of Florida. So, how are you addressing these
challenges that exist? Is that just the money? Is that what is
needed?
General Spellmon. No, sir. I wouldn't say it is just the
money. We have--given the investments that Congress has made in
our navigation program, it has forced us to take scheduling
with the dredge industry to a whole new level. I think you are
aware that there are 19 hopper vessels in the United States of
America working today. Four of them belong to the Army Corps of
Engineers. I mentioned 577 navigation channels. You can imagine
the scheduling exercises that we go through.
We have great, great partners in the dredging industry. We
have just got to take our scheduling game to the next level.
Mr. Webster of Florida. So, in your testimony, I think you
talked about performance-based and focusing on high-performing
projects. What are the markers you look for to make something a
high-performing project?
General Spellmon. Yes, sir. So, in that case, we are
looking at the amount of cargo that may come in to a port, the
amount of traffic that transits these navigation channels on a
monthly, on an annual basis. That is generally what we mean
when we say performance-based.
Mr. Webster of Florida. But in a high-performing project
would be, how does it get to that point? How do you move from a
performing project to a high-performing project?
General Spellmon. Yes, sir. And I am happy--I can share
with you all of our metrics that we use for high-use ports,
medium-use ports, and low-use ports, how we measure that.
Mr. Webster of Florida. So, there are three rankings?
General Spellmon. Yes. Yes, sir.
Mr. Webster of Florida. OK. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. Larsen.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Secretary Connor, the BIL provided a downpayment of about
$17 billion for backlog of construction, and you said that
these historic Civil Works funds strengthen the supply chains
and so on.
Earlier this year, the Corps announced the obligation of
most of these funds for ongoing projects. Do you have
preliminary estimates of the number of jobs created or
benefited by BIL?
Mr. Connor. Lots. I wish I had better metrics as far as the
specific jobs that are anticipated based on the level of
investments. We can do a little deeper dive on the----
Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. That would be
really helpful for us.
Mr. Connor. Absolutely.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. It helps us to continue to make
the case that we are just not doing investments for their own
sake, but in addition to flood control or mitigation or coastal
resilience, we are putting women and men to work as well.
Mr. Connor. Absolutely. It deserves a deeper dive.
Obviously, we are keeping all of the contractors, major
construction entities, skilled laborers busy. But the reality
is, is these are significantly time-consuming projects that are
going to go out in a decade, and we need to have the next
generation of those skilled laborers in place.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. That's right. And these
investments from the BIL address the growing backlog of
authorized construction projects. But how have they helped you
deal with lingering operation and maintenance obligations as
well?
Mr. Connor. I will take a threshold cut at that. I know the
O&M on aging infrastructure is just tremendously significant.
The ongoing need for moving dredge material--for dredging and
then moving dredge material, we got in quite a deficit
situation. So, between the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,
disaster supplementals where we get a little bit ahead of that,
it has been game changing.
And then you combine that with what General Spellmon
mentioned where we coordinate outages with industry partners
because we have resources that we can plan these outages and
major rehabilitations, we get our work done quicker. We get it
done in partnership with industry, and it allows us to plan for
and do things much more smoothly and keep the economy moving,
quite frankly.
Is there anything you would add?
General Spellmon. Ranking Member Larsen, I would just add
that, for example, forced outages at our hydropower plants is
declining. Unscheduled maintenance at our locks, at our gates
are declining, and I am happy to share those metrics with you,
but this is making a difference, and I know the Nation and we
greatly appreciate the investment that is being made.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. It takes money to do those
things. Let's keep that in mind as we move forward on whatever
the next version of BIL is or whatever funding approach we are
going to take in the future.
In WRDA 2022, we expanded the section 214 authority, which
I think we started the 214 authorities probably in 2000, if I
am not mistaken, and have consistently been reauthorized. We
made it permanent a few years back, and now we expanded the
authority to expedite review of entities' permit application,
to include the evaluation of mitigation banks.
Can you talk a little bit about how that authority has been
used? And if so, has it led to faster processing times for
mitigation bank permits?
General Spellmon. Yes, sir, I will start.
This is a very regional problem set. We have some corners
of the country where there is plenty of mitigation bank space--
--
Mr. Larsen of Washington [interrupting]. I am not
surprised, in that section 214 was first started by Brian Baird
from Washington State, because it is very regional.
General Spellmon. Yes, sir.
I will start at 30,000 feet.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Sure.
General Spellmon. Very varied availability across the
country for mitigation banks. In some corners, we have plenty
of space. In others, as in Washington State, we are fighting to
get more options on the table, and what we are doing in Puget
Sound is a good example of that.
Mr. Connor. Could I just add, with respect to mitigation
banking, I think, given the loss of jurisdiction at the Federal
level, what we do with respect to reinvigorating the rules that
we have under the 2008 rule of looking at jurisdictional,
nonjurisdictional wetlands as appropriate mitigation, I mean,
the goal is to protect and restore wetlands, and I think we can
do a better job through our mitigation program. So, post-
Sackett, we are looking at those opportunities now.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. All right. Well, I hope Sackett
doesn't mess up section 214 implementation too much or at all.
I have 16 seconds left. I will follow up with a question
about Federal assumption of maintenance at the Port of Everett
for the record.
Thanks a lot.
Mr. Rouzer. Without objection.
Mr. Mast.
Mr. Mast. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Good morning, General.
General Spellmon. Good morning, sir.
Mr. Mast. How are you doing?
You and I end up talking about Lake Okeechobee every time.
I don't think today will be any different. I appreciate your
opening remarks, talking a little bit about reducing algal
blooms and things like that.
A little bit more open-ended conversation this morning. Can
we just talk a little bit about where we are at with NMFS? What
is going on there? What do they want? What do you guys want out
of it? What is going on between that and the new Lake
Okeechobee System Operating Manual?
General Spellmon. Sir, thank you for the question. In
short, we are not where we want to be. We do not accept the
biological opinion that was given to us for the Lake Okeechobee
system.
Mr. Mast. Just lay that out first, the opinion, as we are--
--
General Spellmon [interrupting]. Of why, sir? Why?
Mr. Mast. A short ``what it is that they are saying'' and
``what is not accepted.''
General Spellmon. Yes, sir. So, we don't accept the BiOp on
both its scientific and legal foundation. I will start with the
legal foundation.
The biological opinion that science take on listed turtles
to the Corps based on pollution levels in Lake Okeechobee and
the surrounding waterways. As you know, Congressman Mast, I
don't have any discretion on water quality. I do on flows and
releases. So, that is the legal foundation.
On the science side, they have tied Lake Okeechobee
releases to red tide events on Florida's gulf and Atlantic
coast specific to Lake Okeechobee releases. And so, our
question, we just asked to see the analysis and the data. How
do you separate Lake Okeechobee water from the rest of the
runoff from Florida's 35 coastal counties or Florida's other
waterways? That is what we have asked to see. We did not make
progress with our Jacksonville District. We have elevated this
decision to the Secretary for his consultation with the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
Mr. Mast. How would you separate it?
General Spellmon. I wouldn't separate it.
Mr. Mast. Just to elaborate on how--to give one example of
how I could see it, maybe not how you guys would see it or how
NMFS would see it, right. But you know my coast. You know the
canals and tributaries to some degree. I might say you might
separate it by a man-made canal, freshwater versus brackish or
saltwater. Those would--and I have argued that, that those seem
like different things to me, and I think scientifically you
could have that argument. Maybe somebody could argue on the
other side.
How would you do it if that is the game that you have to
play with NMFS? And do you have to play that game with NMFS? If
you don't play that game with them, does LOSOM just go away?
General Spellmon. No, Congressman Mast, LOSOM does not go
away. We are invested. We think--as you know, we believe it is
a significant improvement from where we have been with LORS. I
don't know how to separate it. I don't think it should be
separated. Again, it is not the flow. They are tying it to the
pollution levels in the lake. And as I mentioned, I don't have
any discretion on the pollution levels in the lake and the
impact on red tide and then the subsequent effect on sea
turtles. Again, that is the primary reason why we don't accept
this biological opinion.
Mr. Mast. You do have input on pollution levels if we
authorize you to do so. That would be correct?
General Spellmon. Sir, we would follow the direction of
Congress.
Mr. Mast. That is good to have that out there.
Mr. Connor, I saw you nodding your head. Did you have
something to add to this?
Mr. Connor. The ball is in my court now to engage at the
policy level with our friends at NOAA Fisheries. But I do think
this is a very significant issue that has broader implications,
and I know the most important thing now is we have got to get
LOSOM done because it has benefits across the board.
But I have been in a lot of ESA discussions over my career,
and not accepting the Corps' view of its discretion about how
it operates that facility is problematic, quite frankly, and I
have never had a situation before where that has not been
accepted, that ``here is the limits of our discretion.'' So,
that is the issue we have to have.
Yes, there is a scientific issue about the contribution of
Lake Okeechobee to potential red tide and those impacts, but we
will move forward expeditiously, Congressman, because it is an
important issue for everybody.
Mr. Mast. I appreciate that.
I would just make this one other, I guess, observation or
statement. This administration treats carbon like it is a
pollutant. Maybe some could argue or agree with that, but I
think they treat it similar to a pollutant in the way that they
regulate it and want to penalize it, want to tax people for use
or production of carbon. It is treated like a vice. If that is
the case, then I think looking at the quality of water should
not be a far stretch for the Corps of Engineers.
We don't have any more time, but I appreciate you all
engaging in the dialogue with me. Thank you.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Mrs. Sykes.
Mrs. Sykes. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you for being here. Good to see you after our
canceled meeting in October.
I am going to jump right in because I have got a lot of
questions for you. This is a big deal in Ohio's 13th
Congressional District where I represent, and I specifically
want to talk about one of the communities in my district in
Massillon.
There is a project in which the Army Corps of Engineers has
been working on. You just wrapped up a $22 million levee safety
investment at the dam there, which is very much needed and for
the safety of our community, and I want to thank you for all
the work that you have done for the people of Ohio 13 so far.
But we had one snag here, and I am hoping you can help me
get some answers. This year, when we were working with
Massillon, we discovered that the Corps could not help fund a
gate replacement for their dam. Part of this is because of the
unique contract where the city and the Corps split the
maintenance funding 50/50.
The last water resources bill through WRDA 2022 gave you
all authority to help repair certain dams if the right
conditions were met, but, unfortunately, one of the problems
that cropped up in our conversations was that your office
hasn't put out any guidance related to your new section 8152
authority that the WRDA 2022 gave to the Corps for the first
time.
So, Assistant Secretary Connor, I just want to ask if you
and your team are working to get that guidance out the door,
and when we can expect it so we don't run into issues like this
again in the future?
Mr. Connor. Congresswoman, we are doing guidance on 12
provisions in WRDA 2022, but I don't believe section 8152 is
one of those provisions. That is something I am going to have
to look into more closely. I know it has been an issue in your
district, but at this point in time, we are not preparing
guidance on that particular provision.
Mrs. Sykes. Thank you so much for that answer, and we will
certainly be in contact and remain in contact with you so we
can settle this once and for all.
I do want to talk a bit about one of the points that you
made about your projects being very longstanding, 5-, 10-, 15-,
20- to 30-year-long projects, and one of those specifically in
Ohio's 13 was--maybe not your project but one in which you
helped with--the removal of the Gorge Dam in Cuyahoga Falls
into Akron.
I want to mostly talk about the pipeline of talent that you
have working with you and alongside you and how you are
developing folks to be prepared to work on those projects that
exist longer than 10, 15, 20 years.
General Spellmon. OK, ma'am, if I understand the question,
it is on project duration based on personnel and manning?
Mrs. Sykes. Yes.
General Spellmon. Yes. So, ma'am, I mentioned we just had
our second highest program in our 249-year history. Today we
are also at our highest workforce level in the Army Corps of
Engineers in the past two decades. This morning, just under
38,455 personnel.
And you are absolutely correct. We don't do this by
ourselves. We do it with great partners at the State and local
level, and there is a great information sharing and great
cross-development of all these talented STEM professionals in
each and every one of these projects and certainly something we
want to do more of.
Mrs. Sykes. Thank you, sir, for that answer.
And I want to direct your attention to some of the remote
personnel that you have suggested. And if you could discuss how
not having onsite personnel will impact your work emergency
situations if a lot of this work is being remotely supervised
and monitored.
General Spellmon. OK. I think this is a remote work
question. Congresswoman, post-COVID, the Corps never left work.
We may have done it from different locations, but we never left
the workplace. In fact, at the height of the pandemic, we were
working in nearly every major city across the country and
building alternate care facilities to help the hospital staffs
have greater facilities.
Yes, our districts may look a little different. I know my
headquarters looks different today than it did 3 years ago. It
is just that people are working from different locations, other
headquarters. We are just taking advantage of all the tools
that Congress and the administration has given us to continue
delivering our program.
Mrs. Sykes. And with my final 30 seconds, I am going to
give you an easy one here. Can you just talk to us about how
important funding these infrastructure programs are for the
work that you do and for communities like mine in Ohio's 13th
Congressional District?
General Spellmon. Ma'am, I think it makes a huge
difference. I just mentioned a couple of examples before on the
hydropower plants. We are seeing fewer forced outages. We are
seeing fewer unscheduled maintenance periods on our locks. On
dredging in the State of Ohio, we are getting after those
channels in a more consistent and timely manner. It has been
immensely helpful for our program.
Mr. Connor. If I could just add real quickly, I think the
biggest value is, we are building capacity. We are building new
restoration efforts. So, we are not just maintaining the
systems which we have that are very valuable to many
communities, but we are building capacity particularly to take
our ports, harbors, inland waterway system where that is
America's competitiveness. That is where we can produce more
jobs and create more opportunities. And so, these resources are
just invaluable for that effort.
Mrs. Sykes. Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentlelady yields back.
Mr. Burlison.
Mr. Burlison. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Table Rock Lake is extremely important to southwest
Missouri. When I was campaigning, I realized that as I was
interacting with the community leaders. And I want to work well
with you all on how we can make sure that we have access,
recreational access, make sure that landowners and resorts are
working seamlessly together, and making sure that the lake is
kept beautiful as well.
But I will say that I am surprised at how many phone calls
that I get. I get a lot of phone calls. Probably next to
passport renewals, this is--from issues at the lake from
individuals is one of the top phone calls that our office gets.
Now, in fact, one constituent is here in this room today
because he flew up to our Nation's Capital to have a meeting
with me to address concerns related to his home and his
neighbors' homes and a septic tank that is barely, barely on
Corps land and has been apparently allowed. It was approved
decades ago, but the Corps is now telling them that they have
to remove that septic tank.
Now, look, I know that septic tanks are not that big of a
deal to you, but to the constituent who is willing to fly to
their Nation's Capital because just moving that septic tank
will cost four homeowners $250,000. It's not affordable. And
then ecologically, I would be hard-pressed to explain the place
where they would have to move it to, how that would somehow
improve the quality of the lake. And so, I don't know if you
want to address that.
General Spellmon. Sir, first of all, thank you for the
comments and your constituent who flew here to share his
concern.
We have encroachments all over the country. My direction to
our Southwestern Division regional commander was stop writing
letters to the landowners where we have encroachment issues.
Let's knock on doors and talk to people face-to-face. And we
want to work with everyone. We have resolved a number of these
already. We have 356 to go, solved 76 recently, and we are just
going to work through these one by one.
I agree with you. Does it make sense to move a septic tank?
Sharing the detail that you just shared with me now, no, it
doesn't. What we are concerned about is public safety. We want
to keep homes from being inundated, and that is why we just
want to have a home-to-home, family-to-family conversation with
everyone.
Mr. Burlison. One of the things that I have been trying to
address is try to figure out a solution to this on a broad
scale, so that there is a bright line so that individuals who
are adjacent to the Corps property have options or flexibility
with the Corps and that it's not this perceived perception that
their neighbor is getting a better deal than they are getting.
Are there any kind of changes that we could do in policy
that would make it sure that it's across the board fair for
everybody?
General Spellmon. And thank you for that, sir. And we can
and we will do better on the communication front.
Mr. Burlison. OK. The other thing I would say is that one
of the concerns is, we have parks where the infrastructure has
been declining over the years. Several of the parks that are
controlled and managed by the Corps, the bathroom facilities,
they're just not being kept up-to-date, and that's not for lack
of trying. Obviously, there are financial reasons and needs.
Are there any thoughts on how we can maybe address it
through designating some funds for these kind of improvements
at a lake?
Mr. Connor. Congressman Burlison, thank you for your
advocacy on behalf of our recreation facilities.
First of all, we have, over the last couple years,
increased our budget for recreation facilities. I mean, we are
the second largest recreation provider in the Federal
Government, more camp sites than the National Park Service,
which surprises a lot of people. So, we have got to take care
of these facilities. I have been out to many of them. The staff
are doing all they can, going to extraordinary means to
maintain bathrooms to make them more user-friendly and just
attractive, quite frankly.
So, there is a fundamental lack of parity with respect to
the resources available to reinvest from recreation fees into
facilities. I know there is legislation. I can't comment on
legislation in this context, but I think that particular
provision and bringing the Corps' recreational program on
parity with other Federal agencies is really important to look
at, and we are open to that conversation and to working with
you all as you try and work through those issues.
Mr. Burlison. Thank you. Thank you.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. Stanton.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
A major component of the recent WRDA bills has been
authorization for environmental infrastructure assistance,
including in my State of Arizona. And I expect environmental
infrastructure assistance will continue to be supported in the
2024 WRDA.
In Arizona, more than $37 million in EI funds have been
allocated to 23 projects to help our communities and Tribal
nations use wastewater more efficiently, recharge area
aquifers, and improve water delivery and conservation through
new wells and pipelines. And we anticipate more projects will
be funded in 2024. Yet, to date, not one of these projects,
some of which were funded nearly 2 years ago, have been able to
break ground.
General Spellmon, I appreciated our meeting last week and
your commitment to improving the delivery of these EI funds to
Arizona's communities as they work to mitigate the impacts of
the ongoing drought.
Given the continued focus and interest on EI by Members on
both sides of the aisle, how is the Corps working to ensure
that EI projects funded by Congress get out the door to
communities in a timely and efficient manner?
General Spellmon. Yes, sir. And, sir, thank you for your
time last week in meeting with us.
I share your frustration, as I told you last week, and I
rightfully have taken some bruising from my boss sitting next
to me on our inability to deliver this program. You have given
us $38 million for 17 projects, and I have got 1 project
partnership agreement to show for it.
What we are doing, specifically to Arizona, as I shared
with you last week, we have hired a program manager and two
project managers, and we are starting twice weekly calls with
each of these project sponsors to move them along in the pipe.
We are working with new partners. They are working with us for
the first time. We are going to get better.
Mr. Stanton. I appreciate that.
WRDA 2022 included several provisions that I authored to
enhance the Corps' ability to tackle drought, wildfire, and
other natural hazards that impact the Corps' infrastructure and
water management. Specifically, these provisions directed the
study of nature-based approaches to minimize risk to Corps'
water supply facilities in the West, expansion of managed
aquifers recovery efforts, and an assessment of opportunities
to partner with non-Federal entities to reduce wildfire risk.
Can you provide updates on the specific studies and efforts
to enhance the Corps' ability to proactively respond to these
disasters and what additional authorities could be beneficial
to consider in addressing these challenges given the reality of
climate change and the ongoing drought throughout the West, in
particular the Colorado River Basin?
General Spellmon. Sir, I will begin. We have some limited
success in this field with some work that we have been doing in
California. I have got to do a better job at my level in
sharing these best practices across our enterprise where we can
get greater application, say, in Arizona. I don't think I have
adequately used all the authorities that you have already given
me, and we just need to step on the gas and get more of these
types of features in the ground complementing our traditional
steel, concrete, compacted dirt construction.
Mr. Stanton. I appreciate that.
And, finally, I want to touch upon an important project to
me personally, a passion project, I have been working on it a
long time, and that is the Tres Rios Ecosystem Restoration
project. And I have been working on that since I was a city
councilman in the city of Phoenix, subsequently mayor of the
city of Phoenix, and now in my time as Congressman.
Can you assure me that the Post-Authorization Change Report
and cost update for this project are on track for completion to
be included in 2024 WRDA?
General Spellmon. Congressman Stanton, yes, we are on track
to have that PACR ready for Congress' consideration in WRDA
2024.
Mr. Stanton. All right. Can you ensure me that it will be
ready on time for that? Again, I only reiterate that because we
have been here a long time waiting for that.
General Spellmon. Congressman, we are set to turn that
assessment in in May, the month of May, fiscal year 2024.
Mr. Stanton. All right. I appreciate that. I will be
looking forward very much to receiving that report so we can
move swiftly forward with including Tres Rios in WRDA.
With that, I yield back. Thank you.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. LaMalfa.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Appreciate you being here from Army Corps. Thank you.
General Spellmon, first I want to say thanks. We had a
question, it would have been in October, about extra credits
left over from the Sutter Butte Flood Control Agency in
northern California from the projects there that we were
wondering if that was going to be able to transfer those excess
credits, and at this point, you have already done so. So,
appreciate that for other projects in our State of California.
Thank you for knocking that out.
A quick question on something I heard a little bit earlier
in the committee. There's going to be 15 Chief's Reports issued
this year. Is that what you said?
General Spellmon. Congressman, that is correct, 15.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK. Remind me, does a Chief's Report have one
project card or some have more than one project in them?
General Spellmon. Sir, one project per Chief's Report.
Mr. LaMalfa. One per. OK. All right. We always want to move
the pace and scale up here, so, 15 per year. We have got a lot
to do.
I am very concerned, in northern California, as you know,
we have talked about in the past, with the ability to capture
water and the amount of water that is flowing out of our State
and our watersheds. Even in drought years, we have a tremendous
amount of water that gets away from us.
So, this year, for example, in mid-January, we had a
tremendous rain and snowpack. Ninety-five percent of the
precipitation that was coming towards the delta went straight
on out to the Pacific Ocean, 95 percent. And what Californians
are facing is that some municipalities are going to ration
people down to 42 gallons per day per person. And that is not
even enough to fill your pet's little wading pool you have in
your yard. And so, we have a real juxtaposition of issues here
when we have had such abundant water, almost record snowpack
this year and then just a few years ago, and yet they continue
rationing and cutting down to such a minimal level what people
can use in urban and city settings, as well as agriculture,
which is being decimated in the San Joaquin Valley and got hit
really hard in 2022 in northern California as well. And then
just recently here in mid-October, 77 percent of the water was
still flowing into the delta straight out to the ocean.
So, we hear about, well, we can make desal. Well, it takes
so much energy. Why not capture the water when it is still
fresh instead of taking it? And then they don't want to give
the desalination projects, as we saw in the Poseidon down there
in, what, Huntington Beach, after 20 years. They turned that
down. So, there is no solution for some of these people.
So, improvements in what is known as the FIRO, which is
known as forecast-informed reservoir operations, we have talked
about this, improved weather runoff forecasts more modernized
instead of from manuals from the seventies. We can potentially
keep water in the reservoir sooner and longer above the
conservation levels that are currently in place.
So, the Yuba-Feather FIRO was released in December 2022,
having the final assessment out in 2023 and hopefully
implementation in this WRDA year in early 2024. How are we
doing on that?
General Spellmon. Sir, FIRO in short is a game changer. I
know you are aware of the success that we experienced at Lake
Mendocino. Now that we have a template, we are sharing that
with the other projects that are undergoing the FIRO viability
assessments and that will accelerate our implementation.
I would just add----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. I am sorry. I am running short
of time. I hate to do that.
What do we see on this--on this particular one on timeline?
General Spellmon. Sir, I am sorry. Is this Mendocino?
Mr. LaMalfa. No, no. Yuba-Feather.
General Spellmon. Oh. So, sir, on New Bullards Bar, final
viability assessment this September. If we find it viable--we
believe we will--we are going to operate that reservoir on a
deviation just like we are doing Mendocino while we take up the
NEPA on the water control manual.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK. So, we can see that during this rainy
season we are about to enter here this year?
General Spellmon. September of next year, sir, we will
complete the--September of 2024, we will complete the viability
assessment.
Mr. LaMalfa. Wow, doggone it. All right. I guess we are
getting there.
So, on the Sackett decision v. EPA, the WOTUS rule 2023,
which became effective in September, we have been--landowners
are waiting to hear from the Corps or EPA or somebody on
implementation guidance. So, the rule became effective, was
sent to district staff.
Can this committee have a copy of this implementation
guidance for States that are adhering to the conforming rule in
the pre-2015 preliminary--excuse me--regulatory regime? Pre-
2015 regulatory regime. Is that something we can get
immediately for this committee and help inform our people out
there?
Mr. Connor. We have the conforming rule which we issued in
September. We are now working through the jurisdictional
determinations. We do not have new regulatory guidance at this
point in time. We will be in the process, over the next months
and the next year, of developing that guidance. Certainly, that
will be a public process----
Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. So, where does that leave
people that are caught in limbo on what the Sackett ruling had
been to them, on decisions they will make on ponds or building
on their land or raising--anything they would be doing that has
an effect here?
Mr. Connor. Well, there is clarity in the rule now with
respect--we don't have a significant nexus test. We don't have
a former definition of adjacent wetlands. We have had to revise
that as a result of the rule. We no longer include wetlands
just because of their interstate process. So, we have adjusted
the rule to be clear in conformance with the Sackett decision.
So, that provides clarity in and of itself.
We are working through AJDs. We will publish all the AJDs--
jurisdictional determinations--we do that will provide factual-
based decisionmaking for people to understand. And we are
moving through--we have done about 634 of these jurisdictional
determinations since September, so, that's providing a database
to give clarity for people working through this effort.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK. I appreciate that, because they need to
have clarity because they can't get caught in limbo here. And
would you make sure the Sacramento office understands that,
because that is where some of the biggest problems have been in
the past at least, like in Tehama County, on enforcements that
have been just really out of line, OK?
Mr. Connor. We are making sure everybody is going to be in
alignment.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you so much.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Ms. Norton.
Ms. Norton. I thank the chair and ranking member for
holding today's hearing.
The District of Columbia is wholly dependent on the Potomac
River for its drinking water, but natural man-made events could
render the river unusable for drinking water. This poses a
grave risk both to the operations of the Federal Government and
to DC residents.
The federally owned and operated Washington aqueduct
produces drinking water from the Potomac River for DC and parts
of Virginia. However, the aqueduct maintains only a single day
of backup water supply.
The Water Resources Development Act of 2022 contained my
provisions authorizing the Army Corps to conduct a feasibility
study on a secondary drinking water source and additional
drinking water storage capacity or capability for the DC area,
but it is my understanding that the Army Corps has had
difficulty finding a non-Federal sponsor to share the costs of
the study, which is understandable because the study affects
multiple jurisdictions.
Given the importance of this study to the operations of the
Federal Government and the cross-jurisdictional nature of this
study, I will be submitting a provision for inclusion in the
Water Resources Development Act of 2024 that would require the
Army Corps to fund 100 percent of the cost of this study.
Lieutenant General Spellmon, does the Army Corps support
funding 100 percent of this study?
General Spellmon. Congresswoman Norton, I would state it
this way. This is a unique Civil Works project. It does not
receive any Federal funding. The Washington aqueduct receives
its resource by local ratepayers through three water suppliers:
DC Water, Arlington County, and Fairfax Water.
And I would just give you one update. We do have a very
talented and willing non-Federal sponsor to help us with this
study once funds are in receipt, and it is the DC Metropolitan
Council of Governments. So, we are ready to step off. We just
needed a new start authority or funding, and we are ready to
move out. And I agree, this is a much needed investigation.
Ms. Norton. So, you do support 100 percent funding of this
study?
General Spellmon. Yes, ma'am.
Ms. Norton. I will close by noting that I am deeply
concerned about the multiple World War I-era munitions found in
the National Park Service-owned Fort Totten Park in the
District of Columbia which is located in a residential
neighborhood and is regularly used. An unexploded ordnance was
uncovered on the Fort Totten trail in 2020, and two more metal
canisters were discovered in a different location in Fort
Totten Park on August 18, 2023.
I thank the Army Corps for publicly announcing, along with
the National Park Service, that it is seeking funding to
conduct a comprehensive investigation of Fort Totten Park for
munitions and any resulting environmental damage.
On November 16, 2023, I wrote a letter requesting that
funding for this important investigation be included in the
President's fiscal 2025 budget. I urge the administration to
include this funding.
And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentlelady yields back.
Mr. Ezell.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I am glad to be part of this process and to support the
important projects that are going on and been authorized in my
district by the Water Resources Development Act. Today, I want
to continue talking about the Lower Mississippi River study
which was authorized by previous WRDA in response to the 2019
Bonnet Carre spillway openings.
Mr. Connor, I am glad we are here to see you again today,
and your staff have been very, very excellent to work with. I
also want to thank you for your commitment at a previous
hearing to include Mississippians as stakeholders in the Lower
Mississippi River study which will be run by the New Orleans
District. The local leaders, fishermen, and business owners of
the Mississippi gulf coast really deserve a seat at the table.
And I understand that the lower river study will take about 5
years to complete and will be quite complicated. Hard to
believe that.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Ezell. So, really it is important to get it started as
soon as possible.
Do you have any updates on the study?
General Spellmon. Congressman, yes, I do. So, we are in the
scoping phase now. We have engagements that are ongoing at the
moment with all seven States. What we are working is lining up
the State agencies that will partner with the New Orleans
District in advancing this work. I want to thank the committee
for the authority and the funding that we have received. We
have all we need at the moment to continue moving.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
Mr. Connor. Can I just add?
Mr. Ezell. Sure.
Mr. Connor. It is incredibly important. This is the one of
the highest priorities we have. This is the most dynamic river
system in the country. And the thought that we are going to
continue to operate exactly as we have without updating the
science, the interactions with the stakeholders, the interests;
we can't continue to do that. So, it is an incredibly high
priority. I just wanted to assure you of that, Congressman.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you very much.
Do you have any idea when the stakeholder hearings will
start and if that will be public?
General Spellmon. Congressman, once we have our agencies
lined up at the State level, then we will start the public
scoping meetings with those partners in the room with us. So, I
expect that to be later in the spring.
Mr. Ezell. Oh, great. Thank you.
I kind of want to change the topic just a minute.
Continuing to hear about how the contractors that are working
on Civil Works projects are already facing a lot of redtape
which slows them down on these important water-related
projects. There is a newly proposed policy that would force
project developers to guarantee that they have checked every
material and method before beginning a project.
I assume your engineers who understand construction are
already doing this and making good choices about the material
that is being used. Is that correct?
General Spellmon. Yes, Congressman. I am not certain I am
familiar with the specific instance that you are referring to,
but absolutely, that's a part of our checks.
Mr. Ezell. OK. We hear so much about it takes so long
because we have got to check so many boxes. We really need to
move along. And I know it is a priority, and I appreciate that.
So, we just want to make sure that some of these new
regulations do not slow down our construction, and I would
appreciate any and all the support and help we can get for
that.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. Garamendi.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to bring up three important issues for California.
First of all, we have had several discussions about water
supply already. However, water supply is not an authorized
project for the Corps of Engineers, at least in reclamation
States.
Mr. Connor, would you support adding water supply to the
authorization for the Corps of Engineers' projects?
Mr. Connor. I do support adding water supply, yes, sir. I
think it is incredibly important that we look at all of our
facilities and try and secure as many benefits and purposes out
of them. So, flood control is going to be first, but that
doesn't mean we can't look at water supply as we talked about
with respect to forecast-informed reservoir operations.
Mr. Garamendi. Well, then let's get a new law and, for the
committee members, let's add it to this year's WRDA.
Permit reforms. Much discussion about permitting, the
length of time for permitting and the rest. For the State of
California, we already allow the State CEQA, California
Environmental Quality Act, to substitute or to be equivalent to
NEPA for several kinds of projects; for example, airports and
ports themselves, but not for the Army Corps of Engineers'
dredging programs.
Would you support legislation that would allow in
California the CEQA program, which is equivalent and, in some
cases, stronger than NEPA, to be the single requirement for the
environmental review?
Mr. Connor. I certainly support that in concept. We need to
be as efficient as we can in our permitting processes. Even as
we are trying to be more comprehensive and engage more with the
public and stakeholders, we need to be more efficient. If we
can use other products, I think that is great.
Mr. Garamendi. Well, if the CEQA program, that is the
California Environmental Quality Program, is allowed to be a
substitute for NEPA for some projects, for some Federal
projects, we need to add the dredging programs to this so we
can get on with it more quickly and not have to do duplicate
work.
Finally, there is an authorized program for San Francisco
Bay, the Stockton Channel project. This program has been in
existence since 2007. The continuation of it is dependent upon
two things. First of all, the identification of a local
sponsor. We are working diligently to accomplish that; and,
secondly, that it not be rescinded.
Now, each and every year, the Corps is required to go
through projects that are not moving along. This could be
considered one such project because of the removal of the
previous local sponsor. However, if we want to have a real
brawl, just bring to this committee the termination of this as
a project. So, please don't do that. We don't need another
brawl. What we need to do is to work diligently to replace the
local sponsor. So, heads up, looking forward to avoiding a
fight here in the final WRDA.
I thank you for all the work you do on so many different
projects. I will let it go at that. Thank you very much.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. Owens.
Mr. Owens. Thank you.
The Great Salt Lake is one of Utah's most iconic and
important ecosystems. Our own State capital is named after the
lake. Unfortunately, water levels in the lake have been
declining in recent years. In 2022, we saw the lake at record
low elevation. These declining water levels threaten economic
activity, public health, and the great ecosystem.
The Great Salt Lake provides Utah with the highest density
of wetland habitat for plants, brine shrimp, reptiles,
amphibians, mammals like the iconic bison, and birds.
Additionally, the economic output of the Great Salt Lake is
$1.2 billion annually and provides over 7,700 jobs. It also
provides significant amounts of magnesium, salt, and other
minerals. Nearly 2 million tons of minerals are extracted from
the lake every year. As you can see, this is why it is so
important for me and the entire State of Utah.
This year, Utah saw record amounts of snowpack in our
beautiful mountains which helped our water levels across the
State. However, just 1 year is not enough. We need at least a
decade of record snowpack to help us through our drought and
the water levels throughout our State. That is why we need to
work with our Federal, State, and local partners to help
preserve the important ecosystem and to allow Utah to continue
to be the fastest growing State in the Union.
In the last WRDA bill, we began working on this
partnership, and I want to continue this partnership in the
most innovative ways. We need to have the Corps recognize the
importance of the lakes, especially the Great Salt Lake.
For both of you two gentlemen, first of all, I thank you
for being here again. I have heard from our State partners that
we have been informed that it will take nearly a decade for
funding from the Corps to reach the Great Salt Lake. This is,
frankly, unacceptable.
How can we work together to expedite this process?
Mr. Connor. Thank you for the question. First of all, I
share your perspective. I had an opportunity last January on a
very cold day to get out with your director of the Department
of Natural Resources and spent some time talking about this
very issue. And at that point in time, that was before the
hydrology had given us a year's reprieve. But I share your
views that time is of the essence here given the challenges.
So, we have entered into a Planning Assistance to States
agreement with the State of Utah I think a couple of months
ago. And the idea here is there are several different
authorities, not just for the Corps but also Bureau of
Reclamation and other agencies, and what we are trying to do is
work with the State Department of Natural Resources to figure
out the best game plan and how we can use our respective
authorities, reclamation, the State, and the Corps of
Engineers.
So, the Planning Assistance to States agreement will help
us do that, make use of the tools that have been enacted in the
most recent WRDA bills, combine that with the Bureau of
Reclamation Basin Study that is going on now where they have
engaged a bunch of stakeholders, and that is the idea. So, we
are in the planning, development, organization stage, but we
are going to make use of those authorities ultimately,
Congressman.
Mr. Owens. That being said, is there any way that we can
have some seat at the table as you guys have this conversation?
Particularly Utah, I would love to know more what you are doing
here. Anything we can do to kind of help facilitate that or be
part of that process?
Mr. Connor. Absolutely. I think the key is to keep the
delegations informed. We would be happy to provide ongoing
updates as part of the process.
Mr. Owens. I would appreciate if you do that. I think we
definitely have an interest in that.
I have heard from the Sacramento District in the State of
Utah that they are still waiting for headquarters to provide
Planning Assistance to States funding for these projects. Is
that what we are dealing with right now then?
Mr. Connor. Yes. We have got the agreement in place, and I
know we have resources provided by the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law. So, we can follow up on that, Congressman.
Mr. Owens. OK, OK.
The 2022 WRDA included a monitoring and assessment program
for saline lakes like the Great Salt Lake in the Great Basin.
What is the current status of that program?
Mr. Connor. I think that is one of the authorities that
exists that we are trying to figure out how to best use that
authority. And the planning process is how we are going to get
to that. I know we don't have any resources specifically
allocated for that study yet. That is kind of a next phase of
this whole effort.
Mr. Owens. OK. I would like to do this. I would like to
make sure our team is in touch with you guys. The Utah
delegation would love to be part of this conversation, and I
think we are innovative enough to impact the rest of the
country to figure it out. So, I look forward to working with
you on that.
And with that, I yield back. Thank you.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. Huffman.
Mr. Huffman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Assistant Secretary Connor and Lieutenant General Spellmon,
thank you both for your time today. I also want to thank the
Corps for its inclusion of an environmental infrastructure
project in my district in the 2023 workplan. It is for the
Tolowa Dee-ni' Nation, and it is very important. It is going to
help the Tribe and surrounding community replace aging
wastewater infrastructure that serves low-income residents on
the Tribe's land, and we very much appreciate that.
I look forward to working with the Corps on other
environmental infrastructure projects in my district. One that
I want to highlight is the Marin Municipal Water District in
Marin County. Marin was one of the first to declare a water
supply emergency during the terrible 2021 drought. And this is
a district that serves about one-quarter million people, came
really close to simply running out of water. It was quite dire.
And so, we have been working since then on some commonsense
plans that can make us much more resilient and prepared for the
next drought. And I would urge the Corps to include the
district's Soulajule Reservoir project in the 2024 workplan. It
will help increase water yield and provide much needed
operational flexibility.
I also want to thank you for your timely dredging of
Humboldt Bay in my district. The Corps recently repaired and
rebuilt jetties in the harbor, and the community is very
thankful for that.
I am very excited that one of our Nation's first offshore
wind leasing areas on the west coast--this will be floating
offshore wind--is going to be on the Humboldt County coast in
my district. It is going to mean local jobs, clean energy,
really wonderful developments, but the components that will be
coming into port will require major updates to the harbor Heavy
Lift Terminal. That harbor is going to be a very busy place for
the assembling of these floating platforms and turbines, and we
are going to need much more regular dredging.
So, we hope you will continue to be attentive to the needs
of Humboldt Bay. And, sadly, when we think about those needs, I
am focusing on the challenge that we face because the Corps has
only one deep channel dredge in the entire Pacific, the
Essayons, and it has to serve all deep channel dredging for
California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska, and Hawaii. That is
a heavy burden for any piece of equipment, but it is a
particular concern for the Essayons because it is now over 40
years old.
We included a provision in the 2022 WRDA for the Corps to
submit a report to Congress on current and future dredge
capacity and the availability of those assets to meet dredging
needs nationwide. This provision also included an analysis of
the Corps' fleet for each region.
So, I want to just ask you, what is the status of that
report? And can you share how the Corps plans to handle what
will surely be expanded dredging needs in the Pacific with just
this one lonely, aging dredge?
General Spellmon. Sir, I will check on where we are with
the review of our work. This is not a surprise to us. As I
mentioned earlier, we are responsible for 577 Federal
navigation channels, many of them on the west coast.
As I shared, we have got, in the Corps, to take our
scheduling to a higher level just given the limited amount of
deep draft harbor Federal navigation channel assets that we
have, about 19 hopper dredges in the United States of America.
We are working. We have great partners in the dredging
industry. We just have to improve our scheduling.
Mr. Huffman. All right. Well, I look forward to hearing how
you intend to tackle that challenge. I think any way you cut
it, the Corps is going to have to build a new dredge for the
Pacific region to replace the Essayons. And we look forward to
providing you whatever support you need to get that done.
I want to talk about Coyote Valley Dam in my district as
well. We have included language in a bunch of different WRDAs
to direct the Corps to study raising Coyote Valley Dam in
Mendocino County, and yet it never seems to happen. Right now,
the Corps is in reconsultation to try to come into compliance
with the Endangered Species Act. It has got a terrible
turbidity problem. Many experts believe the only way you are
going to solve that problem and come into compliance with the
ESA is to go ahead and raise Lake Mendocino so that you could
have different outfalls and fix some of the infrastructure
limitations there.
Can you just give me a sense of the status of consideration
of this thing we keep urging you to study that would also be a
great way to come into compliance with the Endangered Species
Act?
Mr. Connor. For all the reasons you just mentioned, this
should be a priority, but yet we don't have funding identified
yet, and we don't have a new start. But given the imperative of
water supply plus the environmental aspects of a dam raise,
certainly if funding would be made available, this will be a
priority to get going and work with your folks on seeing what
we can do about a dam raise at Coyote.
Mr. Huffman. All right. Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. Babin.
Dr. Babin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And good morning, General Spellmon and Assistant Secretary
Connor.
I represent Texas' 36th Congressional District, home to
some of the Nation's most critical ports and waterways, really
unmatched numbers of chemical plants, refineries, and a number
of communities that are sensitive to natural disasters that we
have seen over the years, notably hurricanes.
General Spellmon, I know you are familiar with my district.
I hope that we will get you back down there soon to see some of
the good things that are happening and the work we are doing
there in the Houston Ship Channel in southeast Texas.
I would like to thank both of you for your commitment to
protecting and improving our Nation's water resources and
infrastructure. As my district relies heavily on the Army
Corps, we greatly appreciate everything that you do.
I have a few questions, and I would like to hear from both
of you, if that is OK.
First off, I am sure you have spent many hours working on
and thinking about what we call the Ike dike Texas coastal
spine project. I'm not going to ask you to get into specifics,
but I was hoping you could provide us with a very brief 30,000-
foot view of how the project is developing in your perspective.
General Spellmon. Yes, sir. I recently had the opportunity
to visit our team out there. This is a bold plan that would
represent the largest single investment in the Army Corps of
Engineers' history. To me it is a great example of combining
traditional concrete, steel, compacted dirt with natural and
nature-based features.
During my visit with the non-Federal sponsors and our
partners in the room, I challenged the team to develop what we
call an integrated delivery schedule like we have in the
Everglades, another very large program, to show how we would
sequence this work over time and inform the associated funding
decisions. That integrated delivery schedule, sir, is underway,
and I look forward to sharing that with you soon.
Dr. Babin. Super. Thank you very much.
The critical infrastructure there for our national
security, aviation fuels, jet fuels, anything that is energy,
this is the epicenter of energy. So, we need the protection.
Really do.
OK. I would also encourage you on both the coastal spine
project and many other vital projects in and near my district
is to work closely with the local communities in addition to
local stakeholders as well. That includes towns of all sizes,
like Beach City, Pearland, Baytown, Beaumont, Houston, et
cetera. My constituents are paying very close attention to how
projects might impact their communities and their quality of
life, so, please leave no stone unturned and please listen
closely to their concerns.
My next few questions are about the Army Corps of
Engineers' nationwide permitting program which was designed to
allow infrastructure projects with minimal effects to proceed
with a general permit after streamline review.
Does the Army Corps support meaningful Federal permitting
reform legislative initiatives to safeguard the security,
reliability, and affordability of energy infrastructure,
including natural gas pipelines? And if so, how is the Corps
working with Congress or planning to work with Congress to make
the nationwide permit program general permit process more
consistent and more effective?
Secretary.
Mr. Connor. Thanks. I will take a cut at that first.
Dr. Babin. Yes, sir.
Mr. Connor. Absolutely. Permitting efficiency and
competence to work with all the interested parties is the
biggest challenging issue I think facing the Army Corps of
Engineers. We are a regulatory agency. We want to get
infrastructure moving. We want to do in it in a way that
doesn't end up in the courts for decades, quite frankly.
Nationwide permit program, perfect example, broad support.
We strongly support that effort. We move permits efficiently
through that process, through the 56 nationwide permits. We are
currently just beginning the process for the next year 5-year
permitting program. For the 56 permits that we have in place
now, they are good for 5 years, and then we have to start the
process all over again. Certainly, energy infrastructure is a
part of that message. We want to be efficient with respect to
pipelines. We are looking at particularly nationwide permit 12.
We haven't made any decisions about whether or not to revisit
some of the aspects of that permitting, but rest assured the
nationwide permit program is viewed very favorably, and we are
very strongly supportive of it.
Dr. Babin. Thank you.
And how does the Corps plan to address litigation over the
agency's issuance of the nationwide permit program which
continues to frustrate linear infrastructure development? The
repeated legal challenges seem to make it seem like there is
not much certainty or predictability in the permit process.
Would you agree? And what is going on there?
Mr. Connor. Well, I know there has been litigation with
respect to the need to follow NEPA. There has been litigation
or concerns about endangered species aspects of those. We think
we have had an effective path forward in the past, but we are
going to take a look at that as part of this new review as we
start the process for the next 5-year cycle.
Dr. Babin. Yes, sir. Thank you very much.
And I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Ms. Scholten.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair. And thank you
to both of our witnesses for being here today. WRDA is,
obviously, one of the cornerstone areas of jurisdiction for
this subcommittee, and this is a very necessary hearing.
I can't believe I only have 5 minutes to get into
everything we need to cover about beautiful Michigan's Third
Congressional District. My district covers miles of gorgeous
Lake Michigan shoreline, including ports in Muskegon and Grand
Haven. It is really hard to overstate the importance of these
harbors to the overall Great Lakes ecosystem and the larger
Great Lakes economy. But to put a few numbers on it,
commodities handled by Grand Haven's harbor alone support over
$3.9 billion in revenue, over 23,000 jobs, and $1.2 billion in
labor income.
In addition, if this harbor was not maintained, commodities
that typically travel by water on ships, including sand,
gravel, salt, cement, manufactured goods, all those things that
keep our roads running would then have to be transported by
train or truck, which would increase annual emissions rates by
over 10.5 million pounds of harmful particulate matter. The
cost to our economy, workforce, and environment in west
Michigan truly cannot be overstated.
I will have two questions. First, which either of you or
both of you can chime into, and then my last question in
particular is for you, Lieutenant General.
So, I understand that the Army Corps is currently doing
quite a bit of work in Grand Haven to repair the breakwaters
and pier heads damaged by high lake levels. Do you see this as
something the Corps will have to do more often due to climate
change moving forward? And if so, how can we ensure that these
structures are regularly maintained?
General Spellmon. Congresswoman, thank you for that. And on
top of all the challenges you just maintained, we are seeing
increased shoaling in many parts of this port. This used to be
a 3- to 5-year dredging cycle. We now believe it is going to be
an annual dredging cycle requirement. And what are we going to
do? We are going to make sure that that is included in our
budget request moving forward.
Ms. Scholten. OK. Thank you.
Mr. Connor, do you have anything to add to that?
Mr. Connor. Nothing more.
Ms. Scholten. Yes. Absolutely correct about the increase in
the shoaling schedule. The Muskegon Harbor has a 2- to 3-year
dredging cycle currently. Shoaling patterns are changing
rapidly there, and we agree with you 100 percent this needs to
happen annually at this point. So, how can that schedule become
a reality? Can we depend on that happening regularly, annually
going forward? And what is needed to ensure that it can happen?
General Spellmon. Congresswoman, what we will do in the
course to make our best technical argument to the Secretary and
to the administration to take care of important harbors like
Muskegon.
Mr. Connor. On that one I will add, and then I have got to
make the best case to the administration and the broader
community given the points you first made of the importance of
these harbors, the importance of inland waterways to the mode
of moving materials and supplies and the supply chains. It is
the most carbon-friendly and most efficient way to move
material in this country. And if we do that also using those
waterways, we are more effective in getting goods in and out of
this country and more effective from an international
competition standpoint.
So, there are all kinds of reasons why we need to keep up
with the new challenges, and we need to maintain these systems
for the benefit of the entirety of the country, not just the
communities that they immediately serve.
Ms. Scholten. Yes, I couldn't agree with you more.
Let's talk about pricetags. Lieutenant General Spellmon, in
particular, in the event that my friends on the other side of
the aisle decide to move forward with the cuts to your funding
levels that are being proposed or being talked about, what is
the Corps' plan to finish these projects that we have talked
about and ensure ongoing dredging happens annually in these
ports with less funding than you were promised?
General Spellmon. Congresswoman, as I have been attempting
to describe during the hearing, we have to improve our schedule
and schedule management with the U.S. dredging industry. We
have great partners across all of the dredgers out there. Just
given the volume of work and the increased sedimentation
shoaling that we are seeing in places like Muskegon, we have
got to take our scheduling with industry to the next level.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you, gentlemen. I can't thank you
enough for your commitment to this work.
And I will yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentlelady leads back.
Mr. James.
Mr. James. I would like to thank the chairman for this
opportunity to speak, and I would like to thank Assistant
Secretary Connor and Lieutenant General Spellmon for being able
to make it up to Capitol Hill today to testify in front of the
committee regarding the state of clean water infrastructure.
Michigan is the greatest State in the Union, and I echo my
colleague, Rep. Scholten's love for Michigan, West Michigan,
but I have the privilege of representing the best congressional
district in the entire Nation, Michigan's 10th Congressional
District.
But speaking for the entire Great Lakes region, with its
unparalleled natural beauty and economic significance, it faces
a pressing challenge. It's time for us to address the critical
need for updating our water infrastructure, especially in Lake
St. Clair. This isn't just about ensuring the availability of
clean, safe drinking water. It is about protecting our
cherished freshwater resources, sustaining our thriving
economy, and bolstering our national security. The Great Lakes
have been a wellspring of prosperity and global trade for
generations. And it is our responsibility to modernize this
infrastructure, to keep this vital engine of our economy
running smoothly, while also fortifying the security measures
that safeguard it.
We stand at a pivotal moment where our commitment to these
goals will define the future of the Great Lakes region, and I
believe that, as we work together, we can achieve and must
achieve nothing less than success. The Nation's aging water
infrastructure is in desperate need of modernization and will
take billions of dollars to make that happen. There is no
replacement for fresh, safe, and clean water.
So, with that, as we all know, the PFOS chemicals, the
forever chemicals in water, represent a major challenge to U.S.
Army Corps in terms of exposure risk to humans.
Do you anticipate that the current U.S. Army Corps funding
will be sufficient to address PFOS issues in the Great Lakes?
And if so or if not, what percentage of projects going forward
will you expect to involve PFOS litigation, sir?
General Spellmon. Congressman James, thank you for that. I
am very familiar with Lake St. Clair and the Great Lakes and
all that they provide our Nation.
I will follow up with you on PFOS and PFOA funding. Our
environmental budget has skyrocketed in the Army Corps of
Engineers, and we are very aware of this acute challenge that
you mentioned. I would like to follow up with you and give you
a more thorough answer on its application to the State of
Michigan and the Great Lakes.
Mr. James. I will hold you to that, sir. And I would like
that followup to be in my district. I would love to welcome you
out to Lake St. Clair. We can see it for ourselves. Thank you
for the work that you are currently doing.
And for either of you, question 2, with remote lock and dam
operations, how will the Army Corps of Engineers meet the need
for onsite personnel in times of emergencies?
General Spellmon. So, Congressman James, we are really in
the pilot stage on remote lock operations. We have not employed
this technology extensively throughout our 234 locks across the
Nation. To be frank, we are learning as we go. Our next
significant effort at this will be in the Pittsburgh District.
And we intend to learn more as we attempt to tie together
several of our locks and dams on the Allegheny, the
Monongahela, and the upper Ohio.
So, we have more to learn here, sir, and we will keep you
appraised of our efforts as we move forward.
Mr. James. As I am sure you agree, we have zero margin for
error when it comes to the safety and security of our dams and
lock systems.
Leading into the last question, what is the Army Corps'
plan to address an unscheduled lock outage caused by, say, a
cyber attack or failed remote operating system or any things of
that nature?
I actually authored and got a bill passed through the House
for a study on securing our Soo locks in particular. The Soo
locks are vital to our national security and the economic
security, and the Army Corps must have the resources it needs
to defend and protect and ensure the proper maintenance and
operations.
What is your plan to address any outage? Because that is
unacceptable.
General Spellmon. Yes. Congressman James, first of all, we
would be a willing participant in any reporting requirements.
And security at the Soo locks in particular, that is a layered
approach between ourselves, Federal, State, and local security
providers, and I would welcome the opportunity in another
setting to give you a detailed rundown on the current threats
and the mitigations that we have in place at the Soo.
Mr. James. Mr. Connor, do you have any comments?
Mr. Connor. No. Absolutely support the whole efforts with
respect to funding our cybersecurity efforts and then
integrating them into these important critical facilities,
absolutely.
Mr. James. OK. With that, Mr. Chairman, the only thing I
have to add is, go Army, beat Navy.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. Ryan.
Mr. Ryan. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I want to second my colleague's call for Army to deliver a
crushing blow to Navy in football this weekend in a bipartisan
manner and welcome either of our distinguished guests here to
comment on any of their thoughts on how decisively Army will
defeat Navy this weekend, if you want to be on the record
during this Army-Navy week.
General Spellmon. Sir, 35-0 Army.
Mr. Connor. As a former star wide receiver, I will defer to
him.
Mr. Ryan. All right. You have already made--I have the
privilege of representing the United States Military Academy at
West Point in the district. So, you made many thousands in my
district happy with that answer, and I appreciate you being
here. In all seriousness, thank you for taking the time.
First question is related to one of my communities in New
York's 18th Congressional District in the Hudson Valley. Kiryas
Joel is a community in my district, one of the youngest and
fastest growing communities in the entire United States. For
years, Kiryas Joel has been working on a water infrastructure
project, the Catskill aqueduct project, to ensure that as the
community rapidly grows, they are able to continue to access
clean water and are no longer relying on maintaining and
building new wells in the community.
This is and has been a priority project for the people of
my community. While the project has been included in section
219 environmental infrastructure projects back in 2002's WRDA,
it has never been awarded funding.
I want to commend that the Biden administration has put a
special focus on Justice40 communities so that 40 percent of
Federal investments flow into disadvantaged communities like
Kiryas Joel who would qualify due to the rapidly growing size
in median family income.
Can either or both of you please explain how the Corps will
prioritize environmental justice communities like Kiryas Joel
when prioritizing their environmental infrastructure projects?
Mr. Connor. With respect to Kiryas Joel, Congressman, thank
you very much for the interactions you have had with the
administration in our office because it was in part because of
those discussions that we included $5 million for environmental
infrastructure in our 2024 budget, first time that we had ever
asked for money for the environmental infrastructure program.
From the looks of things, if we get an energy and water bill, I
am not quite sure that that will survive the budget process,
but you have got to start somewhere.
But if we have discretionary funds for EI as part of the
2024, you can be assured that we have prioritized economically
disadvantaged, marginalized communities for allocation of those
efforts. Most of those moneys are directed to specific
projects, but to the extent that we have discretion, that will
be part of the criteria, without a doubt.
Mr. Ryan. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. And we will continue to
persistently engage and appreciate the continuing engagement
with you and your team.
Second question. In July, across the Hudson Valley, we had
an extreme flooding event, record-setting rainfall,
particularly hitting the towns of Highland Falls, Cornwall, and
Fort Montgomery, as well as West Point proper. While the
current study, the New York and New Jersey HAT Study, is
ongoing to look into flooding really from the Port of New York
and New Jersey up into the Hudson River--that has already been
authorized in the previous WRDA bill--that would not
essentially look at events like this where, in this case, a
brook that runs through the middle of several of these towns
that is not technically a tributary to the Hudson caused this
catastrophic flooding, including the loss of a young woman's
life right in the town of Fort Montgomery.
So, the question really is, how can we--given the
incredible volatility and increased frequency of climate
change--factor in new tributaries and water sources when
assessing in future studies like this?
General Spellmon. Congressman, I will start. So, in WRDA
2022, Congress has helped in section 8106. It allows our non-
Federal sponsors in a study like New York New Jersey HATS where
we were looking at that from a coastal event, a Superstorm
Sandy type event, for our non-Federal sponsors to come back to
the Corps, to come back to the Secretary and look at things
like the precipitation event that you just described. I know we
are in the process now of working with the States, with our
non-Federal sponsors, and the Secretary's office to talk about
time and resources required to add that additional scope to
this investigation.
Mr. Connor. And I would just add on top of that, in
addition to our sponsors being able to bring that request to
us, the Corps is doing a lot of great things behind the scenes
with respect to new modeling, new engineering pamphlets. Our
behind-the-scenes planning process is where we are directing
the planning teams to incorporate the best hydrologic
information, the new extremes that we are seeing that create
new risks with respect to these facilities.
So, I think we are getting in place the processes and the
data and the requirements for our planning teams to use the
best information so that we can better plan for those extremes
as we get into those studies.
Mr. Ryan. Thank you both.
And I yield back, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. Collins.
Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Secretary Connor, good to see you again. General Spellmon.
As I was sitting here listening to my colleague from
Michigan espouse about his State, I could not help to be
reminded of how Georgia has been back to back numerous times.
No, not the Bulldogs, but for being the number 1 State to do
business in. And that is kind of where I want to focus on.
I know the last time that, Secretary, you and I talked, we
talked a little bit about Augusta, Georgia, and a dam that they
have got a problem with up there. But this time I want to focus
on the Savannah Port. As both of you are aware, the Corps
recently completed construction activities down there on the
Savannah Harbor expansion project. But, however, in order for
the Georgia Ports Authority to maintain growth and create well-
paying jobs, they are going to have to expand that harbor again
to accommodate the ever larger container vessels that are
demanding--and I like to underline that word--demanding access
to the Port of Savannah's facilities.
And as this committee begins development of a Water
Resources Development Act, we are going to seek authorization
of a new feasibility study to deepen and widen the harbor. But
I encourage you, you and your team, to consider using any
existing authorities to review the completed work so we can
begin a feasibility study as soon as possible.
And so, the only thing I really ask--and I would love to
get some sort of answer from you both--just I need a commitment
that you will use the existing authorities for conducting an
assessment on the current project and moving it forward with a
feasibility study.
General Spellmon. Congressman Collins, I will start. First
of all, you are right, section 216 is our review of completed
Civil Works projects. I would like to come back. I have got
more homework to do. Technically, the SHEP deepening is not
complete until I am done with the environmental work upstream
at New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam. As you know, that is in
litigation at the moment. Let me do more homework to see what
flexibilities we may have under section 216 in advance of an
additional authority Congress may consider.
Mr. Connor. Congressman, I wouldn't add anything more to
that, but this is, obviously, a very significant economic
enterprise in your State----
Mr. Collins [interposing]. Right.
Mr. Connor [continuing]. And for the country as a whole.
So, we will follow up, absolutely.
Mr. Collins. General, is there a timeline I can expect?
Mr. Connor. On the homework, sir, I think I can get back to
you within a few days. On the litigation, no, sir, I can't.
Mr. Collins. I mean, my teacher always gave me 1 day.
General Spellmon. Sir, we will turn this as quickly as we
can.
Mr. Collins. All right. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, that is all I have.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. DeSaulnier.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I am not going to get into football rivalries, but good
luck to everybody. How is that?
I represent a district in the San Francisco Bay area. I
have represented the delta--geez, I was just thinking--for a
very long time in local, State, and now here in the Federal
Government. It is a complex area. It is a very important
deepwater port. It is the largest estuary west of the
Mississippi.
We have very progressive politics towards carbon capture.
We have, I think, one of the biggest carbon capture--natural
carbon capture projects, successful ones, in the delta,
supplies much of the drinking water for both southern
California and northern California, transporting that water
both for urban uses and for the San Joaquin agricultural
industry that produces one-third to half of all the fruits and
vegetables in the entire United States. All of that is to say
it is a complicated area. We have got five oil refineries
because there are, as I said, very few deepwater ports on the
west coast.
Having dealt with your department in all of those
positions, how do we continue to look at cost benefits as we do
projects and, in our case, interacting with the State Water
Project and local government, to make sure we get these
facilities done efficiently with cost benefit that shows that
we can deliver these projects quickly?
We have been in a drought in California, as you know,
significant impact to the delta. You are very involved with the
delta conveyance projects, whatever that turns out to be. I am
not a supporter of the current Governor and previous Governor's
project, but I think in the end, delta is consistent with the
work we have done to be smart about long-term cost benefits for
carbon and the movement of carbon.
One of the biggest carbon producers in California is the
movement of water in the State Water Project, which we partner
with, trying to get that water over the Tehachapis is a
significant provider.
So, the question is, how do we look at this in a very
dynamic area like this where economically it has been very
beneficial as we look at transitioning those fossil fuel
industries to renewables, which we are doing aggressively and
successfully, but using you as an engineering partner, and a
very important one, to get nonpartisan, nonpolitical analytical
engineering that is driven by cost benefits, not just in the
near term but in the complexity of this new environmental and
economic environment that I would argue--and not to get in the
parochial who has got the best district, but we have a district
that is in an area in the bay area that while we have been very
driven about our environmental stewardship, we have done it
with good cost benefits based on laws that were signed by
Ronald Reagan when he was Governor. So, it is not just opinion.
It is, how do we do this in a way that is really a model in
many ways for a new economy?
And lastly, for international trade, you delivering these
projects has a direct relationship. We spent a lot of time on
dredging for the Chevron Refinery in Richmond and the
complexities of doing that to the highest environmental
standards but still being sensitive to the cost benefit both
for the public sector and the private sector.
General Spellmon. Congressman, I will start. First, on the
topic of comprehensive benefits, this is something Secretary
Connor has pushed us, rightfully, very hard on. We have had a
handful of studies, investigations where we were looking beyond
our traditional widening our aperture to look at things more
comprehensively, environmental benefits that are difficult to
measure. In fact, we have some R&D initiatives to help us get
better metrics on some of the benefits that we traditionally
have not measured.
You have our commitment. We are sharing our best practices
as we work our way through these four or five investigations
because we want to expand that body of work to just about every
investigation that we do.
Mr. Connor. I would just add, I mean, we have very creative
engineers who love working with their partners to look at all
the benefits that they can apply to any particular project, and
it is a more complex world. So, if it is carbon benefits, if it
is water supply as we are doing flood work, as we are looking
at environmental restoration, we want to do that.
And getting to the nonpartisan, my predecessor, Mr. James,
issued a directive for the Corps to study comprehensive
benefits. We want to take that now to the next level where we
identify it. We will quantify where we can. We have to
understand where there are other benefits, and we want to
modernize our approach with respect to principles,
requirements, and guidelines that are essentially our tools for
developing benefit-cost ratios.
And so, we need to allow folks to do the creative work by
having rules in place that allow us to recommend projects that
define and achieve that broader set of benefits. So, we are in
the process. We are going to issue a proposed rule hopefully in
the next week or two that will start this process so we can get
it done next year.
It is a great question, Congressman.
Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you. Really appreciate it.
I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Mr. Duarte.
Mr. Duarte. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Well, I represent a large portion of the San Joaquin Valley
from the delta down through very low-lying towns along the San
Joaquin River. We had huge problems up and down my district
last year with towns flooding, with a lack of dredging, a lack
of maintaining of the flood channels, all of which could not be
improved upon while the flooding was occurring, as you might
imagine.
One specific problem we have is the lower San Joaquin River
feasibility study that runs through Lathrop and the lower San
Joaquin River right as it enters the delta. It has been
hamstrung. It doesn't meet your own 3x3x3 rule. It is now
scheduled to happen in 2027. It has been pending there for a
number of years. And at least in that case, I want to encourage
you to look at that, and please advance that as you can.
But my district is riddled with unmet needs from the Army
Corps of Engineers. And the irony I find, listening to all my
friends and colleagues here talk about wetlands issues that
aren't being handled sufficiently to help commerce and ports
and drainages, is wetland issues that involve no wetland at
all.
And with that, I would like to show a picture of a
jurisdictional or what you claim to be as a jurisdictional
vernal pool in the San Joaquin Valley. This one is actually out
at the Sacramento Valley.
[Picture displayed.]
Mr. Duarte. If you can't see it, that is part of the
message here today.
Under WOTUS, the Army Corps of Engineers has been claiming
jurisdiction over topographic swales for decades. It has been
controversial, and we all thought it would have been cleared up
back in the Sackett decision, which came down very decisively
earlier this year, so that the term ``continuous surface water
connection'' with navigable waters in the United States was
necessary for you to claim any jurisdiction over these types of
wetland features through the Clean Water Act. And in January,
you issued a memo, an initial rulemaking that recognized this
to some degree and recognized Sackett.
But then on September 27 of 2023, this year, just a few
months ago, you signed a memo, Secretary Connor, that said the
agencies would continue to apply the overbroad pre-Sackett
interpretations of continuous surface connections from the
January 2023 rule preamble, and how soon can we expect the
administration to formally rescind the illegal pre-Sackett
guidance, acknowledging the Supreme Court's binding
interpretation of adjacent wetlands and following the law.
What you are basically saying is that you can daisy-chain
this kind of a seasonal wetland feature across the entire field
to the next one.
Now, I have been involved in these kinds of regulatory
efforts myself. I have been prosecuted for planting wheat on
ground just like this one under the WOTUS wetlands rules.
The Sackett decision said--let me just read you some quotes
in case you are still vague--waters may fairly be read to
include only those wetlands that are, quote, ``as a practical
matter indistinguishable from waters of the United States,''
meaning navigable, ``such that it is difficult to determine
where the water ends and where the wetland begins.''
That wouldn't be the case in these vernal pools across the
landscape.
So, in summary, let me ask and then let you answer. Why is
the Army Corps of Engineers and EPA completely disregarding the
findings of the Sackett decision and continuing to regulate
isolated wetlands that have no surface water connection with
navigable waters of the United States whatsoever?
Mr. Connor. That is not a correct statement, Congressman.
That is not what we are doing. We just issued a conforming rule
on September 8 that expressly eliminated the significant nexus
test. It modified the definition now of adjacent wetlands. It
took out wetlands that are identified as jurisdictional water
because they are interstate, and we have the eight exemptions
that we had in the January 2008 rule.
I haven't issued any substantive guidance with respect to
interpretation of continuous----
Mr. Duarte [interrupting]. Your Sacramento office will not
be regulating this as a jurisdictional wetland under WOTUS at
this point?
Mr. Connor. I am not getting into any fact-specific
situations. I am just telling you we have a conforming rule
that is consistent with Sackett. We are working through
jurisdictional determinations right now. We are going to
ultimately be issuing guidance. That will be a public process.
But your statement that we are not in conformance with Sackett
is an incorrect one, sir.
Mr. Duarte. You are absolutely not in conformance with
Sackett. Sackett says clearly several times and, in fact, they
go again, ``In sum, we hold that the Clean Water Act extends to
only those `wetlands with a continuous surface connection to
bodies that are `waters of the United States' in their own
right.' ''
You are still regulating these wetlands across agricultural
landscapes up and down California. There is no possible way
what you are saying and what is the actual on-the-ground truth
melds with the Sackett decision.
Mr. Connor. You are offering me a specific determination
made by the Corps post-September 8. We can have a discussion
about whether or not we are regulating areas like this,
Congressman.
Mr. Duarte. Well, these----
Mr. Connor [interrupting]. I am happy to have that
conversation every day.
Mr. Duarte. Your Sacramento office didn't even get back to
us with delineations on map--on wetland features that are
clearly not jurisdictional.
Mr. Connor. Bring me a specific determination. I am happy
to----
Mr. Duarte [interrupting]. They are not issuing
determinations. They are sitting on their old determinations,
and we can't get any results out of them.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman's time has expired.
Ms. Wilson.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Ranking
Member Napolitano, for convening today's hearing.
I remember when I first got to Congress 13 years ago, WRDA
was not on a 2-year cycle. To advocate for the restoration of
the 2-year cycle, I launched the bipartisan Florida Ports
Caucus, alongside my friend and fellow Floridian, Congressman
Bill Posey. Over the last decade, we got on cycle. This
committee has delivered on the WRDA's goal of protecting our
water supply, especially in communities vulnerable to the
threats of climate change like my hometown, Miami-Dade.
As one of the five cosponsors of the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, I want to highlight the $17 billion in
supplemental funding to the Corps. Miami-Dade County is already
reaping the positive outcomes of Biden's infrastructure law and
the Corps.
Additionally, I proudly sponsored community projects led by
Florida International University to improve Biscayne Bay and
address water issues in neighboring cities.
But my community still needs help. First, we need funding
for our section 219 Miami-Dade wastewater infrastructure
project. We authorized this critical project in WRDA in 2022.
Now we need to fund it, especially considering the $4 billion
septic system crisis we are currently facing in south Florida
that is contributing to the pollution of Miami-Dade's aquifer
and Biscayne Bay. As many septic tanks risk being compromised
when it rains, these failing septic systems directly threaten
disadvantaged communities, especially given rising sea levels.
Situated at the forefront of the climate crisis and
surrounded by water, my district is vulnerable to sea level
change, and we depend on Everglades restoration. Failing to
pass the WRDA is not an option for us. We cannot afford the
consequences of neglect, including leaving our water resources
susceptible to disaster and a rapidly changing climate.
With that, I have a few questions. Assistant Secretary
Connor, in your March 15, 2022, memo, you highlighted the need
for all communities to share the benefits of a healthy
environment. Within that context of Justice40 highlighting the
aim to tackle the crucial waste infrastructure issues in
disadvantaged communities, how are these entwined goals
considered when determining the spending plan for environmental
infrastructure?
Mr. Connor. Congresswoman, thank you for the question. As a
threshold matter, we have the President's goal of ensuring that
40 percent of the resources that we have towards environmental-
related infrastructure is benefiting marginalized economically
disadvantaged communities. So, we have prioritized a number of
our outreach programs, Planning Assistance to States, Flood
Plain Management Services, where we are doing more aggressive
outreach to inform communities of the resources and the
authorities that we have at the Corps of Engineers to do work
that will benefit those communities that have been historically
ignored.
And then we are certainly looking at modifying our rules,
as we talked about just a little bit ago, how we assess
benefits and costs so that we can look at social,
environmental, as well as economic benefits and make
determinations and recommendations so that we can incorporate
those features because, quite frankly, as we only protected the
highest value properties, that has been our historical
approach, that has been inequitable.
And so, we need to better assess the benefits that we can
have for many communities. So, we are looking at integrating
that into our planning, as well as through the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, the specific investments that we made that
didn't always go to the absolute highest benefit-cost projects.
We looked at, under direction in the law, of how to spread
those benefits among many communities. So, those are a few
examples of how we are trying to address this.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Can you elaborate on the next
actionable steps from the August meeting that you had with
Miami-Dade County about the additional alternative status for
the feasibility study? Our mayor and I want to expedite these
projects for WRDA 2024.
Mr. Connor. With respect to Miami Back Bay and the study
that we are doing in that context, one, I think we are looking
at it from a regional perspective, which I think is the proper
way to assess this. And given the urgency and the risk that
exists from sea level rise and more powerful storm surges, we
are trying to look at a phased approach where we are trying to
do first phase feasibility work, look at critical
infrastructure, look at nonstructural means that we can take in
the near term, see if we can get an authorization in place
through WRDA 2024. And then look at the larger, more strategic
long-term big infrastructure, and that includes large-scale,
natural nature-based features, which is very important to the
local sponsor, as well as just hardened infrastructure that we
may need to protect the community in a way that they will
accept. And that is the longer term second phase of the
approach there that we are taking.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Van Orden.
Mr. Van Orden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As you guys know, the Army Corps of Engineers encompasses a
tremendous amount of very rural areas. And the Third
Congressional District in the city of Wisconsin that I
represent has the largest contiguous sections of the
Mississippi River of any congressional district in the country.
You go from lock 2 to lock 11. We have the tributaries of St.
Croix, Chippewa, Black River, La Crosse, and Wisconsin Rivers
that all go into there.
And I have toured all of our locks and dams. I want to make
sure that our lock and dam operators that are listening
understand not only do I appreciate their hospitality, but I
appreciate their professionalism. And I have firsthand
knowledge of how incredibly important it is to keep these
things going.
We just got designated as part of the northern corn belt
ports--
[Aside]: What is that? John James from Michigan; whatever,
dude.
I speak regularly to Colonel Eric Swenson from the St. Paul
District, and Jesse Curry from Rock Island, and they have been
very, very supportive, and I want to start with a good news
story for you guys.
We had a lot of flooding back in April, and we contacted
them, because I have a personal relationship with these two
gentlemen that are running these districts, and they were
standing by to help the township of Campbell, and they
immediately deployed, as soon as Governor Evers called us an
emergency, these incredible pumps to help get rid of the
flooding on the island. And due to the direct result of the
hard work of the men and women of the Army Corps of Engineers,
you were capable of saving 70 houses in the township of
Campbell, and I don't know why that wasn't front-page news.
But here is the issue. I have got 19 whole and partial
counties in the district, and the problem is that folks don't
understand what you are capable of doing and what you are
tasked to do. So, not only is it just the Mississippi River and
these big-time ports and harbors and all that stuff, you are
responsible for doing a lot of the work on these inland
waterways. And my problem with this is that there are a lot of
anecdotal stories about--I wouldn't say intransigence by the
Army Corps of Engineers, but I would say a certain lack of
responsiveness by the Army Corps of Engineers, and sometimes
people just give up on asking for things. That is one side.
The other side of the coin is this: They don't know what
you are capable of doing or why and when.
So, what I would like to know from you guys is, what is
your type of outreach to communities in these small counties
in, for instance, my district in the State of Wisconsin who
can't afford to have somebody that can go through all these
crazy regulations and all of these things that are out there
that say what you can and cannot do?
So, what specifically, General, is your outreach to smaller
counties and communities so they know that they can leverage
your assets?
General Spellmon. Congressman Van Orden, first, thanks for
the question.
Just a bit of context for some of the frustration that your
constituents are feeling. I command an organization that is
built, it is manned, it is structured for a $22 billion a year
construction program--or actually $92 billion. So, it is hard
for us to get out to these small towns.
I think what work that we are doing in Arcadia, the work
that we are doing in the city of La Crosse, we are working hard
to get out and educate people where we can, and we have the
bandwidth to do that. I agree with you, we have got to get
better. We have got to speak in plainer English, and we will
work hard to get out to the communities that you have
mentioned. It is just an amazing workload that the team is
working through at the moment.
Mr. Van Orden. I get it. You are underresourced and
overtasked.
And then I just have one more thing for the Under
Secretary. Sir, could you read this for me.
Mr. Connor. Go Navy.
Mr. Van Orden. Thank you very much.
And then if you would follow that up with this.
Mr. Connor. Go Army.
Mr. Van Orden. That is the root of the problem. The man
can't read. I was just kidding.
Hey, thank you very much, sir. Listen, anything I can do to
help you guys, tell me, because it is critically important to
the economy for the State of Wisconsin. It is incredibly
important for the national security of this country that we can
work collaboratively together. So, I have your phone number and
you have mine. Thank you very much.
Mr. Connor. Sir, can I just mention, you have been out to
our facilities. It raises spirits. People have mentioned this
to me after you have been out there.
Mr. Van Orden. They are awesome. All right, thank you very
much.
I yield back, sir.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Van Orden.
And now we recognize Mr. Moulton for 5 minutes.
Mr. Moulton. Thank you very much.
Gentlemen, in 2022, the Massachusetts Department of
Transportation closed the Hall-Whitaker Bridge in Beverly when
an inspection revealed major deterioration. The bridge linked
the critical parts of the city and carried 8,000 cars per day.
The timeline for the bridge's reconstruction is beyond
comprehension.
Let me emphasize to you: This is a bridge barely wider than
this room. The Chinese would take it down in a night. All
right. And yet what we are being told is it will take until
2027 to just get a temporary replacement and 2035 for a final
replacement. To be honest, I think that's an embarrassment.
Onerous permitting requirements coupled with a complicated
swing-span bridge design are apparently to blame, but it is not
like we have never done any of these things in the past. We
have been building swing-span bridges for hundreds of years.
I recognize that the Corps is not responsible for the
bridge design, but it does serve as the Federal general
contractor for the bridge rebuild, coordinating approvals for
multiple Federal agencies before issuing the permits.
So, General Spellmon, what can the Army Corps do to
expedite the permitting of the Hall-Whitaker Bridge project to
reconnect the Ryal Side neighborhood in downtown Beverly as
soon as possible?
General Spellmon. Congressman Moulton, thank you for the
question. We have done a site visit, and we do understand the
project. We participated in a preapplication meeting that was
hosted by Massachusetts Department of Transportation. In fact,
we had a meeting with the MassDOT secretary just last week. We
are going to proactively complete our work once we have the
completed application from the builders.
Mr. Moulton. OK. Well, I appreciate your doing that
expeditiously, and please do stay in touch closely with me.
This is a priority of mine. What is framed as an embarrassment
could actually be a great success story, showing that we can
still do big things, even small things, small bridges,
expeditiously.
When you realize that the root of the permitting problem is
environmental regulations and yet the proposal here is not to
replace this bridge with one bridge but literally to build two
in two different locations, a temporary bridge and then the
final bridge, it is hard to imagine that building two separate
bridges is better for this river environment than just ripping
up one and putting a new one down quickly. So, I hope we can
not lose the forest for the trees here, get this done quickly
and expeditiously.
Shallow-draft ports greatly contribute to local economics
of smaller cities and towns. My district has 10 shallow-draft
ports, mostly fishing hubs, who witness increasing challenges
in securing funding for these smaller ports.
Mr. Connor, what can the Army Corps do to ensure that
adequate funding is dedicated to small harbors?
Mr. Connor. I think the best thing we can do is continue to
try and follow the plan that was laid out in WRDA 2020 with
emerging and small harbors, and I think we are in pretty good
shape with respect to continuing that approach, and if we can
continue with the percentages as the amount dedicated to the
Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, we should continue to be able to
get at it. But this is a situation where we are probably never
going to have fully the resources necessary to satisfy all of
the needs, but I think we are on a good trajectory at this
point in time.
Mr. Moulton. OK. Gentlemen, just going back to the northern
part of my district, we were excited to finally see the
Merrimack River dredged last year. The work was critical to
improving navigation and ensuring Plum Island could be
renourished with sand. Unfortunately, the Army Corps' jetty
that sits off North Point on Plum Island is creating a gyre
that exacerbates beach erosion and subjecting more homes to
potential flooding. The Corps is now conducting its own study
of the situation, but we must make the necessary changes to the
jetty itself as soon as possible to secure the coast and
protect homes and livelihoods.
Lieutenant General Spellmon, what can the Army Corps do to
expedite the review, engineering, and construction of the jetty
renovations to decrease beach erosion on Plum Island?
General Spellmon. Congressman Moulton, first, we want to
thank Congress for the $240,000 in fiscal year 2023 funding to
allow us to get after this effort. We are in the modeling phase
now. We are going to produce a major maintenance report to look
at a way, how can we adjust our jetties to get after the
erosion issues that you describe.
So, more to follow, sir, on the schedule once we get
through the modeling phase.
Mr. Moulton. Any idea how long this is going to take? What
is the timeline?
General Spellmon. The report will be complete in the
spring.
Mr. Moulton. The report will be complete in the spring.
Then you have to do----
General Spellmon [interrupting]. With the recommendation,
sir. Then we will come back to the Secretary with our cost
estimate of what it would take for the fix. But I will know
more----
Mr. Moulton [interrupting]. So, all the modeling and
everything will be done by spring?
General Spellmon. I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
Mr. Moulton. All the modeling and everything will be done
by spring?
General Spellmon. No, sir. The report will be done.
Modeling will be complete. We will have our recommendations
ready in the spring. That will inform our next budget
recommendation.
Mr. Moulton. OK. Thank you very much.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer [presiding]. Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I am happy to see here Secretary Connor, General
Spellmon. And I think this is important. And I want to say just
for the record, thank you to the Army Corps of Engineers for
all their missions and for being so critical in helping rebuild
our islands after hurricanes, earthquakes, and a lot of floods.
This is the Federal agency that has best responded to us, and I
needed to say that on the record.
In the recent creation of the Task Force for the Virgin
Islands and Puerto Rico, the VIPR, I know that should help
speed that rebuilding and overcome implementation obstacles.
So, I am very happy to see that task force. We know the
resources are not unlimited, and there is no way to fix every
foot of shore or riverbank and every square meter of wetland
all at the same time, and we appreciate the effort your agency
does.
So, to that end, one important concern of mine is the
effect of inflation and supply chain on the ability to complete
authorized projects. Projects already started or in planning
stages will end up with a real total cost significantly greater
than was originally authorized or obligated.
And my question will be how the Corps addresses this. Do we
need the whole reauthorization or reappropriation process all
over again and bring the project to a stop while we do it, or
reduce the project and leave phases undone, or split those
phases and have to go through the whole process of
reauthorization and appropriation all over again? Or how must
we change that process, how can we change it to make it happen
fast?
General Spellmon. Congresswoman, first, we are working
through the cost increases, and I want to assure you, this is
just not in Puerto Rico. This is everywhere. The number 1 cost
driver on all our projects today is qualified tradespeople in
the construction trades.
I think what we can do in the immediate term is to be
completely open with you, with the administration and Congress
on what we are experiencing. In fact, we are hiring more cost
engineers in the Army Corps of Engineers. We are working to get
our way to 500. That is helping.
As you know, we stood up Task Force Virgin Islands and
Puerto Rico, and that was to give an added level of leadership
and oversight to our program and to enhance our communication,
ma'am, with you and others on what we are experiencing.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. And I am very happy about that. Just
feel free, if Congress needs to do any recommendation, altering
the process, amending the process, that will expedite your time
for processing this or taking decisions, let us know, because I
know how difficult it is to comply with all those requirements.
And one of the other issues, in our case, the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2018 was to be funded at 100 percent Federal
share. However, as mentioned, most of the projects that were
for the recovery process after Hurricane Irma and Maria will
be--the real cost will be much higher. So, what happens now?
What is the difference? Become subject to increase, to double
share? Does the project stop until we reach that original
estimate? What do you do in those cases?
General Spellmon. Yes, ma'am. So, what we are doing now is
we are working on, in some of the cases, finalizing our cost
estimate. As you can imagine, as you know, this is a very
dynamic environment, and everything that you mentioned in the
preface to your initial question is on the table. How do we get
after the highest risk portion of these projects and hold off
on others where we can buy some risk with time?
We owe you all of these recommendations as we continue to
mature our designs and our cost estimates. And, Congresswoman,
I assure you we will keep the lines of communication wide open
with you and your team.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. One last question. And I make this
more for the record, but in that aftermath of the hurricanes,
we received on the island $2.6 billion in supplemental funding
for Army Corps projects, exceeding all previous funds
historically. And since then, we have also received a large
supplemental fund through the Infrastructure Act and other
special appropriations.
But first, we cannot be living under the emergencies
forever in the case of Puerto Rico. The second, every year
there are more communities, not just in Puerto Rico but
nationwide, that plead for projects to address their local
situation that is deteriorating from diverse factors like sea
level rise, sedimentation, erosion, among others.
Does the Army Corps foresee an increase in such
nonemergency demands? And how do we make sure we can identify
where to act before there is an emergency, especially in poorer
jurisdictions where there may not be the resources for a 35-
percent share of cost?
General Spellmon. Congresswoman, I would say three things.
First, we will continue to express capabilities for projects in
nonemergency years so we can get ahead of the exact scenario
you are describing. We are doing much better in workload
sharing than we ever had in the past across our 42 districts,
and I think Task Force Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico is a
great example of that.
And I would just end with, Congress is helping. As I
mentioned, this is a historic time for the Army Corps of
Engineers, a $92 billion program. The Nation is investing in
this infrastructure, and we have got to just get it in the
ground, and we appreciate your leadership.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you. I appreciate that.
I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Thank you, everybody.
Are there any further questions from members of the
subcommittee who have not been recognized?
Seeing none, that concludes our hearing for today.
I would like to thank each of the witnesses for your
testimony.
Before I gavel out, I do have a UC request. I ask unanimous
consent to enter into the record a statement from the American
Society of Civil Engineers dated December 5, 2023, to the
committee regarding priorities for the upcoming WRDA
legislation.
Without objection, so ordered.
[The information follows:]

Statement of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Submitted for the
Record by Hon. David Rouzer
Introduction
The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) appreciates the
opportunity to submit a statement to the House Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure's Subcommittee on Water Resources and
the Environment regarding the hearing on ``Water Resources Development
Acts: Status of Past Provisions and Future Needs.'' We also wish to
express our appreciation to the committee for its commitment to keeping
passage of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) 2024 on a
biennial authorization cycle. Doing so ensures greater certainty for
new and ongoing water resources projects and offers the opportunity to
make needed updates to federal water resources policy. We are eager to
work with the committee in the months ahead to find ways to further
improve our nation's water resources infrastructure systems.
Passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) made
needed investments in critical infrastructure systems and Congress
continued its commitment to investing in water resources infrastructure
policy reforms with the passage of WRDA 2022. These reforms included
reauthorization of the National Levee Safety Program, a permanent
extension of the cost share formula for the Inland Waterways Trust
Fund, and the establishment of a new National Low-Head Dam Inventory.
However, much work remains to be done in the coming year to improve the
overall safety of the nation's dams and levees, strengthen our ports
and inland waterways, and enhance overall infrastructure resilience.
ASCE's 2021 Report Card for America's Infrastructure
Infrastructure is the foundation that connects the nation's
businesses, communities, and people. It serves as the backbone of the
U.S. economy and is vital to the nation's public health, safety, and
welfare. Every four years, ASCE publishes the Report Card for America's
Infrastructure \1\, which grades 17 major infrastructure categories
using a simple ``A'' to ``F'' school report card format. In March of
2021, ASCE released the latest version of its Report Card, giving the
nation's overall infrastructure a grade of ``C-,'' and identifying an
investment gap of $2.2 trillion. While the overall GPA increased into
the ``C'' range for the first time since ASCE began grading the
nation's infrastructure in 1998, much of the nation's critical water
resources infrastructure remains in the ``D'' range. In the 2021 Report
Card, dams and levees each received a ``D,'', while inland waterways
received a ``D+''. The nation's ports were a bright spot in the Report
Card, with a grade of ``B-''.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ America's Infrastructure Report Card 2021. GPA: C-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To raise these grades, ASCE urges Congress to prioritize the
repair, replacement, and modernization of our existing infrastructure,
with a focus on resilience. ASCE also urges Congress to ensure long-
term, consistent investment in our infrastructure systems by passing
authorization legislation like WRDA every two years.
Dam Safety
The United States is home to nearly 92,000 dams, which provide a
wide range of services, including water storage, flood control,
irrigation, hydropower generation, and recreation. The average age of
the nation's dams is roughly 57 years old, with most dams built with a
life expectancy of about 50 years. Because of their advanced age, many
dams in the United States were not designed to account for the severe
changes in weather and increased levels of precipitation brought on by
climate change.
As noted previously, the nation's dams earned a ``D'' on the 2021
Report Card. Advanced age and increased levels of rainfall continue to
place increased strain on the nation's dams and could ultimately result
in greater instances of dam failure. This would cost billions of
dollars, not only in dam repairs, but also in addressing public health
and safety risks in affected communities, as well as from the diversion
of limited resources away from other infrastructure needs.\2\ In
addition, a recent report prepared by the Association of State Dam
Safety Officials (ASDSO) estimates that the total cost of bringing the
nation's dams into a state of good repair stands at $157.5 billion.\3\
According to ASDSO, these costs will continue to rise as dam
maintenance, rehabilitation, and repair is deferred. Without adequate
revenue streams, repairs will continue to be deferred as dam owners
find it more and more difficult to finance expensive rehabilitation
projects.\4\ While IIJA provided a significant down payment to address
the needs of the nation's dams, more must be done at the federal level
to improve dam safety nationwide.

\3\ SCOPE OF WORK (damsafety-prod.s3.amazonaws.com)
\4\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2022, Congress made important improvements to the nation's dam
safety through WRDA, including the establishment of a National Low-Head
Dam Inventory to identify small, hard-to-detect structures that span
across rivers and streams. Flows from low-head dams can produce
hazardous currents that can pull people underwater. Because these dams
are not easily identifiable, the public is often unaware of the dangers
that they pose \5\. A national inventory of low-head dams will allow
for increased public awareness and greater ability to enhance safety
measures around these structures. In the interest of public safety, the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) should move swiftly in its efforts
to implement the National Low Head Dam Inventory.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ Dams--2021.pdf (infrastructurereportcard.org)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two critical federal programs which support dam safety are the
National Dam Safety Program and the High Hazard Potential Dam
Rehabilitation Grant Program, which fall under the purview of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The National Dam Safety
Program is the primary source of federal funding going directly to
states to support state-level dam safety programs. Based on current
state budgets, one dam inspector is responsible for approximately 200
dams on average, and that number can be even more in some states.\6\
Ensuring states have access to adequate federal resources is critical
to easing increased burdens on state dam safety programs. Funding from
the program comes largely in the form of National Dam Safety Program
State Assistance Grants, which are provided to states without
additional cost sharing requirements. These resources support
activities such as dam inspection and monitoring, emergency
preparedness, training, equipment purchases, and staffing needs.\7\ The
National Dam Safety Program was last reauthorized under WRDA 2018, with
that authorization having expired on September 30th, 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Safety--Mother Jones
\7\ State Assistance Grant Program (fema.gov)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike the National Dam Safety Program, the High Hazard Potential
Dam Rehabilitation Grant Program supports repair and rehabilitation
projects for the nation's high-hazard dams, which are dams that would
result in loss of life in the event of a dam failure. ASDSO estimates
that more than 2,300 high-hazard potential dams have a condition rating
of deficient due to a lack of investment in dam safety.\8\ Support for
programs like the National Dam Safety Program and the High Hazard
Potential Dam Rehabilitation Grant Program is essential to prevent
potentially catastrophic dam failures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ Roadmap to Reducing Dam Safety Risks. Association of State Dam
Safety
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, these programs face significant challenges in the coming
years. The program must be reauthorized, and the manner in which State
Assistance Grants are allocated must be reformed to hasten the flow of
federal funding to states. The High Hazard Potential Dam Rehabilitation
Program, while not set to expire until 2026, is in need of reforms to
ensure greater access to grant funds, improve the application process,
and ensure proper operation and maintenance of high hazard potential
dams. Often, dam rehabilitation projects that would benefit from these
grants are deferred because dam operators often cannot afford to take
on the necessary operation and maintenance commitments, and because
smaller disadvantaged communities do not have the resources to afford
cost sharing requirements.
Currently, there is bipartisan support for these efforts in both
the House and the Senate. On August 1, 2023, a bipartisan group of
House Members introduced H.R. 5104, the National Dam Safety Program
Reauthorization Act. The intent of this legislation is to fully
reauthorize the program for five years and spur a discussion within the
Transportation & Infrastructure Committee about including needed
reforms to the National Dam Safety Program and the High Hazard
Potential Dam Rehabilitation Program, which are spelled out above, in
the upcoming WRDA legislation. Bipartisan companion legislation is also
expected to be introduced in the coming days in the Senate. ASCE urges
Congress to move swiftly to reauthorize this critical safety program
and enact the necessary reforms so that state dam safety inspectors
have the resources they need.
Levee Safety
Nearly 17 million people in the U.S. live or work behind a levee.
The National Levee Database contains nearly 30,000 miles of levees
around the country, and current estimates identify up to another 10,000
additional miles of levees outside of the jurisdiction of USACE.
Every state relies on levees to protect communities from flooding.
The average age of the nation's levees is over 50 years old, with many
built using less rigorous standards than those used today. Much like
the nation's dams, the risk to the nation's levees is further
exacerbated by increasingly severe weather patterns and heavier
rainfall brought on by climate change. For moderate- to high-risk
levees in USACE's portfolio, ASCE estimates that approximately $21
billion is required to make necessary improvements.\9\ This is of great
concern given the fact that even well-maintained levees can be breached
by water seeping underneath them. To address these concerns, the
National Levee Safety Program, first authorized in 2014, is tasked with
establishing national levee safety guidelines, supporting the creation
of state-level levee safety programs, and establishing a levee
rehabilitation program to support needed repairs for the nation's
levees. ASCE was very pleased to see Congress reauthorize the National
Levee Safety Program through 2028 in WRDA 2022. This was a top ASCE
priority last year, and it will ensure that the program can continue to
develop and support levee monitoring and inspection activities, levee
repairs, and the overall safety of the nation's levees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ Levees--2021.pdf (infrastructurereportcard.org)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, since the establishment of the National Levee Safety
Program, Congress has appropriated far less than the $79 million
authorized. While annual appropriations have continued to support the
development of the National Levee Database, Congress only provided $15
million for the National Levee Safety Program in FY 2020 and has not
provided additional appropriations since. For the program to reach its
full potential, Congress must provide adequate resources.
Ports
The nation's more than 300 coastal and inland ports serve as
significant economic drivers and places of employment, enabling goods
to reach consumers and the nation to participate in the global economy.
Recent years have demonstrated the critical role these facilities play
in a functioning supply chain. Ports and port tenants plan to spend
$163 billion between 2021 and 2025, concentrating on investments
related to capacity and efficiency as vessel size increases and tonnage
grows.\10\ However, there remains a funding gap of over $12 billion for
waterside infrastructure such as dredging over the next 10 years, with
additional billions needed for landside infrastructure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\10\ Ports--2021.pdf (infrastructurereportcard.org)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ports earned a ``B-'' on ASCE's 2021 Report Card, which recognized
the positive measures included for ports in the 2020 WRDA legislation.
Specifically, WRDA 2020 included full utilization of the $10 billion
balance of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) by allowing $500
million to be appropriated in FY 2021, with an increase of $100 million
annually until it is fully expended by 2030. The full expenditure of
the HMTF was a long-time ASCE priority and ASCE was pleased to see
Congress finally address this issue.
WRDA 2022 maintained a strong commitment to the nation's ports and
harbors. The law authorized dredging projects in underserved community
harbors and required USACE to develop criteria for the evaluation and
ranking of maintenance dredging requirements for small, remote, and
subsistence harbors. ASCE supported these efforts to enhance investment
in dredging activity. Efforts to address challenges in underserved
harbor communities have the potential to help enhance economic
activity, advance environmental justice, and create new job
opportunities.
Inland Waterways
As the nation's ``water highway'', the country's inland waterway
network spans 12,000 miles and serves an important purpose in the
movement of a variety of goods, such as agricultural products. This
infrastructure, which includes locks, dams, and navigation channels,
has benefited from recent boosts in federal investment and an increase
in user fees. However, the system still reports a $6.8 billion backlog
in construction projects and ongoing lock closures \11\, which harm the
industries that rely on waterways to transport goods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ Inland-Waterways-2021.pdf (infrastructurereportcard.org)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inland waterways, on which about 830 million tons of cargo are
moved annually, earned a ``D+'' in the 2021 Report Card. As with ports,
WRDA 2022 included measures that ASCE considered positive for inland
waterways. ASCE appreciated the permanent extension of the Inland
Waterways Trust Fund's (IWTF) cost share, adjusted in 2020 from 50%
general revenue-50% IWTF to 65%-35% for construction and rehabilitation
projects. The IWTF, which finances construction and rehabilitation
efforts, is supported by a 29-cents per gallon tax on barge fuel. The
general fund-IWTF cost share formula of 65%-35% was set to expire
within the decade, and the removal of that sunset provision offers a
measure of certainty for future construction and rehabilitation
projects. While ASCE continues to support further adjusting of the cost
share requirement to a 75%-25% split, the provision that makes the cost
share formula permanent is still a positive step in supporting
construction efforts and reducing the inland waterways project backlog.
The IIJA invests $17 billion in inland waterways and ports, which
can help reduce the funding gap of $25 billion over 10 years referenced
in the 2021 Report Card. However, additional funding for inland
waterways projects is still needed, partly because of complicating
factors such as inflation, worker shortages, and geopolitical
conflicts, which impact the steel market. Dependable funding can also
contribute to reliably planned construction timelines. Unscheduled
maintenance closures are costly interruptions to the inland waterway
system because they drive traffic away from rivers and force shippers
to rely on trucks, which are more costly and environmentally harmful to
operate.
Stormwater Infrastructure Financing
Stormwater infrastructure can take many forms, including piped
systems, detention basins, ditches, canals, channels, and roadway
conveyance systems. In recent years, green stormwater infrastructure
has been introduced in new developments and coupled with traditional
``gray infrastructure'' to maximize the benefits from natural
hydrologic cycles using vegetation, soils, site grading, and natural
filtration processes. Green infrastructure provides benefits by
reducing runoff, minimizing erosion, and contributing to water quality
improvements; examples include rain gardens, constructed wetlands,
vegetative roadway bioswales, and permeable pavements.
In 2021, ASCE's Report Card for America's Infrastructure assessed
the nation's stormwater infrastructure for the first time and assigned
a grade of ``D,'' meaning the infrastructure is in poor condition and
at risk. The effects of climate change are producing more severe and
unpredictable weather patterns, including increased levels of
precipitation. This, coupled with the increased frequency of rainfall
events, places increased strain on stormwater infrastructure systems
nationwide. The results have been increased urban flooding, which has
resulted in billions of dollars in direct damages, as well as hazards
to public safety.\12\ When stormwater systems become overwhelmed, they
begin to affect the functionality of other infrastructure systems.
These effects may include flash floods, sinkholes, collapsed roadways,
and inundation of wastewater infrastructure leading to polluted
waterways.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\12\ https://infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/
12/Stormwater-2021.pdf
\13\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Programs like the Clean Water State Revolving Fund program and the
Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act can support stormwater
infrastructure projects. However, lower funding levels and competing
water infrastructure priorities reduce the effectiveness of these
funding sources. The growing challenge posed by urban flooding on
overstrained stormwater infrastructure systems requires a more
dedicated approach.
Proposed Solutions
WRDA provides a unique opportunity to take necessary action to
strengthen the nation's infrastructure. A biennial WRDA cycle provides
federal agencies and communities throughout the country predictability
to plan and make progress on infrastructure projects. To ensure the
safety and extend the life of critical infrastructure, and support more
water infrastructure projects, we urge Congress to support the
following priorities:

Reauthorization of the National Dam Safety Program and
needed reforms to the High Hazard Potential Dam Rehabilitation Program.
These two programs serve as the backbone of federal efforts to ensure
the safety and resilience of the nation's dams. Congress has
demonstrated its willingness to support these programs through needed
investments in the IIJA and must continue to build on these investments
to improve dam safety and protect downstream communities. We ask that
WRDA 2024 include:
+  A five-year reauthorization of the National Dam Safety
Program, ensuring that program can continue to support state-level
programs through 2028.
+  The removal of unnecessary limitations in the existing law
prohibiting states from receiving State Assistance Grant funding
totaling more than 50% of the cost of implementing state dam safety
programs. States are already required to make reasonable efforts to
fund their own programs, and removing this limitation will allow for
annual appropriations and IIJA funds to flow more freely to states.
+  A new definition of ``small underserved community'' for the
High Hazard Potential Dam Rehabilitation Program, and waiving of the
35% non-federal cost share requirements for grant-eligible communities
that fall under this definition. This will provide greater protection
for communities that own or could be significantly impacted by a dam
failure, but do not have sufficient resources to afford the required
match.
+  Ensure that operation and maintenance responsibility for high-
hazard potential dam projects falls on dam owners and not smaller grant
subrecipients.

Language requiring an update from USACE on efforts to
implement the National Low Head Dam Inventory, which was authorized in
WRDA 2022.

Creation of a program dedicated to financing stormwater
infrastructure projects.

Continuing to allow for the use of the unspent balance of
the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and spend down this balance on port
projects.

Ensuring full use of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund
continues to be appropriated.

ASCE urges Congress to maintain a bipartisan two-year cycle and
pass WRDA 2024. This is critical to provide predictability to federal
agencies for planning and review of projects and priorities and to be
able to better respond to increasingly unpredictable threats, such as
climate change. A regular WRDA schedule is also essential for members
of the civil engineering community who rely on support from Congress,
for USACE, and for other agencies to ensure design, development, and
construction of critical infrastructure moves forward in a timely and
efficient manner. This helps to ensure infrastructure remains resilient
in the face of evolving challenges, and that communities have access to
needed services and protection from potential hazards.
Conclusion
ASCE appreciates the opportunity to provide the committee with this
statement on its priorities for the upcoming WRDA legislation. We
strongly believe that our nation must prioritize needed investments in
our nation's water resources infrastructure to ensure public safety, a
strong economy, and the protection of environmental resources. Support
for our nation's dams, levees, ports, and inland waterways is needed to
close the growing funding gap and to ensure the U.S. has world-class
21st Century infrastructure. We look forward to working with the
committee over the coming months as the WRDA process unfolds.

Mr. Rouzer. Seeing that we have no other questions for the
hearing today, the subcommittee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:27 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Submissions for the Record

----------

Letter of October 24, 2023, to Hon. Sam Graves, Chairman, and Hon. Rick
Larsen, Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
from Sean O'Neill, Senior Vice President, Government Affairs, Portland
Cement Association, Submitted for the Record by Hon. David Rouzer
October 24, 2023.
The Honorable Sam Graves,
Chairman,
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Rick Larsen,
Ranking Member,
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen:
The Portland Cement Association (PCA), which represents the
majority of U.S. cement manufacturers, appreciates the Water Resources
and Environment Subcommittee holding today's hearing entitled Water
Resources Development Acts: Status of Past Provisions and Future Needs.
We welcome the opportunity to share the cement industry's perspective.
Our nation's waterways play a critical role in the movement of
cement from manufacturing plants to market. Annually, the cement
industry ships approximately 35 percent of our product from plants to
terminals by barge, demonstrating, that these systems are vital for
American commerce. Additionally, water infrastructure construction is a
critical market for cement in the United States. For every billion
spent on water infrastructure construction, approximately 211,000
metric tons of cement will be consumed.
The cement industry has set a goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. A
key component of reducing the carbon footprint of cement in the shorter
term is increasing the amount of lower-carbon cements used in
infrastructure projects in the United States. Portland cement is made
by intergrinding clinker, the main energy intensive ingredient, with
gypsum to a fine powder. Replacing a portion of the clinker in portland
cement with ground limestone or supplementary cementitious materials
(SCMs) reduces its embodied carbon. These cements give specifiers,
architects, engineers, producers, and designers a lower carbon way to
execute any structure with virtually no modifications to mix design or
placing procedures while maintaining the resilience and sustainability
provided by portland cement with a lower carbon footprint.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey data, nearly 25 percent of
all the cements used in the United States in 2022, and 45% percent of
cement consumed in the first 5 months of 2023, were lower-carbon
cements, including portland-limestone cements, up from less than five
percent just two years ago.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-
center/cement-statistics-and-information
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the largest purchasers of cement in the United States is the
federal government. However, in some ways federal agencies are slowing
greater use of these lower-carbon cements, including the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (Corps). The Corps follows the Unified Facilities
Guide Specifications (UFGS), which are model specifications used in
specifying construction for Corps projects. The UFGS are not updated on
a regularly scheduled basis. Instead, updates to sections of the UFGS
are typically only initiated when a Criteria Change Request is made.
There are references to acceptable cement types in 80 sections of the
UFGS; however, very few references to portland-limestone cement or
ternary blended cements are included.
The Water Resources Development Act should direct the Corps to
update the UFGS on a regular basis to both drop references to
construction materials that are no longer defined in national standards
specifications and include references to portland-limestone cement and
ternary blended cements, that are market ready and recognized by
consensus-based standards setting organizations. Doing so will not
dictate the cements used by the Corps but simply ensure the UFGS is
kept current with the materials available to be used in Corps projects
and advance the uses of lower-carbon cements where appropriate.
We look forward to working with the Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee to continue the biennial process of passing a
Water Resources Development Act to not only advance critical water
infrastructure projects but also advance policies to ensure the most
impactful results in the delivery of those projects. If you have any
questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Sean O'Neill.
Sincerely,
Sean O'Neill,
Senior Vice President, Government Affairs, Portland Cement
Association.

be issued? Once the inaugural report is published, will the Corps
maintain a two-year report cycle, as required by law?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 5. When the Corps builds out its Federal dredging
operations, what goal is it pursuing and what metric informs that goal?
Does the Corps measure its minimum fleet in terms of number of vessels
or total dredge capacity? Please describe any additional metrics the
Corp utilizes to measure its minimum fleet.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 6. What is the Corps' intention with respect to the Hopper
Dredge McFarland once its replacement is delivered and placed into
service?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 7. As you know, Texas placed a chain of marine buoys on
the Rio Grande at Eagle Pass to deter illegal migration. On October 19,
2023, 20 Committee Members wrote to you both regarding the lawsuit the
Department of Justice (DOJ) brought against the State of Texas. Did the
White House--or any other Executive Branch Agency--instruct you to use
Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act to address this issue? If yes,
please describe the direction you were given and by whom.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 8. As part of its regulatory responsibilities under
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and
Harbors Act, the Corps maintains Nationwide permits (NWPs) for projects
with minimal environmental impacts.\2\ NWPs are an important tool for
building infrastructure in the country.

\2\ See CWA, Pub. L. No. 92-500, 86 Stat. 816; Rivers and Harbors
Appropriation Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. Sec.  403.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why is the Corps undergoing a re-write of NWPs, and what is the
status of this effort? How will the rewrite comport with the Supreme
Court decision in Sackett?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 9. Recently, changes made in the Nashville District have
attempted to treat reservoirs, particularly Center Hill Reservoir,
differently than other Corps reservoirs Nationwide. Specifically, the
changes have been designed to restrict access to the tailwaters of this
reservoir upon only certain users, while the regulation cited is a
Federal regulation with Nationwide application. Public access to the
river for recreational activities, including kayaking and canoeing, is
vital. However, these policy changes may not have been based on
objective data, and not considered in the Master Plan or Corps' NEPA
analysis, deviating from the Master Plan's stipulations. How does the
Corps justify this noncompliance with Federal laws, which denies equal
access for all users?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question from Hon. Brian Babin to Hon. Michael L. Connor, Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Department of the Army, and
Lieutenant General Scott A. Spellmon, Chief of Engineers and Commanding
General, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

Question 1. The Matagorda Ship Channel Improvement Project was
authorized for construction in section 401(1)(8) of WRDA 2020 (P.L.
116-260). Since authorization, the ASA(CW) withdrew his Record of
Decision for the Matagorda Ship Channel Improvement Project Feasibility
Report and Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in December 2022 due to
a recent identification of a discrepancy concerning the quantity of
material to be dredged for deepening the project and the quantity of
such material that was evaluated in the EIS. The Matagorda Ship Channel
is one of the top 100 ports in the U.S. for tonnage and is critical to
maintaining the U.S. as a global economic driver.
The requirement to prepare a Supplemental NEPA document has the
potential to significantly delay initiation of construction of the
project. To have a complete understanding of the impacts to the project
schedule, we request the ASA(CW) provides an update on the schedule to
complete the Supplemental NEPA document, and identify of any issues/
concerns that could delay completion of the Supplemental NEPA document.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Questions from Hon. Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon to Hon. Michael L. Connor,
Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Department of the
Army, and Lieutenant General Scott A. Spellmon, Chief of Engineers and
Commanding General, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

Question 1. In the hearing today we discussed the matter of the
effect of inflation and supply chain on the ability to complete
authorized projects, including those for recovery after Hurricane
Maria, launched under the auspices of the Bipartisan Budget Act of
2018, that at that time were to be funded at 100% federal share.
However, for most if not all, the real cost will be much greater than
what was estimated in 2018:
Question 1.a. What happens now? Does the difference become subject
to increased local shares?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 1.b. Does the project stop when we reach that original
estimate until we explicitly approve more?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2. Constituents from the contractors and construction
sectors have been bringing up those challenges as well as workforce
factors: that the scope of the projects already authorized is so large
it exceeds the capacity of the Puerto Rico construction sector to
perform them all in time and at a reasonable cost:
How is the Corps dealing with this in their contracting? Is there a
way Congress could address this need, such as for example added labor
waivers?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 3. As I understand it, the Puerto Rico Coastal Storm Risk
Management project is due to have a final Chief's Report in May of
2024.
This will really involve only a small number of potential locations
that could benefit, for example in Rincon.
Here we have found competing stakeholder concerns. The first was
residents who did NOT want rock or concrete walls but to seek a more
natural shore barrier, in response the study was extended to find
alternatives. Now we have other residents and businesses who do NOT
want the next alternative which is retreat from the coast since it
means expropriation or loss of property value.
Question 3.a. How do we balance this? What is the experience in
these situations?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 3.b. To have it be paid and done by the Corps, it must
meet a cost/benefit standard, and if not, if everyone rejects anything
that's not the ideal, then the choice of no action prevails. Is that
right?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 4. One thing I have to keep telling my mayors and local
community leaders is that their project or site is, as you say it, ``in
the queue'' be it for approval of new start or for the funding to be
put in the budget request. This can mean years sometimes.
Question 4.a. How has the queue been moving lately, has it been
getting faster, slower?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 4.b. Is there anything the Congress can do to help the
Corps give those communities some sense of certainty?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 5. Often a project winds up ``in the queue'' for specific
approval because while it may have been originally conceived under the
continuing authorities program, it ended up exceeding the dollar limit
or the cost-to-benefit calculation.
Is it necessary for us to legislate at some point a higher total
resource level and higher authorizations for those programs, and/or to
raise the thresholds for projects to come under them?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 6. Is there any outlook for other Chief's Reports in
Puerto Rico over the next two years? What what would be the Corps'
outlook for ``New Starts'' in Puerto Rico in the next two years?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 7. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico
received over $2.6 Billion in supplemental funding for USACE projects,
exceeding all previous funds historically. Since then, we have also
received large supplemental funds through the Infrastructure Act and
other special appropriations. But (a) we cannot be living under
emergencies forever and (b) every year there are more communities not
just in Puerto Rico but Nationwide that plead for projects to address
their local situation that is deteriorating for diverse factors like
sea level rise, sedimentation or erosion.
Question 7.a. Does the Corps foresee an increase in such ``non-
emergency'' demands?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 7.b. How do we make sure we can identify where to act
before there is an emergency, especially in poorer jurisdictions where
there may not be a nonfederal partner with the resources for a 35%
share of cost?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Questions from Hon. David Rouzer to Hon. Michael L. Connor, Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Department of the Army

Question 1. On May 25, 2023, the Supreme Court issued a decision in
the case of Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency (Sackett), which
clarified Federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act (CWA). Members
of Congress, representing communities across the Nation, continue to
hear from their constituents that infrastructure projects are being
delayed because Army Corps Districts do not have the requisite
direction to implement Sackett.
Please detail your next planned step for providing clarity to the
Army Corps districts on how to implement Sackett. Please provide the
timeline for taking this next step.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2. In response to questioning during the hearing, you
suggested the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is focused on issuing
approved jurisdictional determinations (AJDs), and then plans to use a
select number of ``controversial'' \1\ AJDs that have been elevated for
coordination with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to inform some
type of ``guidance process'' \2\ potentially slated for next year.

Question 3.a. Please provide the Committee with the Corps' plan for
addressing this backlog, including the projected timeline for
eliminating this backlog.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 3.b. What additional resources does the Corps need to
eliminate this backlog and return to processing AJDs in a timely
fashion?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 4. In certain districts, we hear that it is taking the
Corps staff an equal amount of time to process preliminary
jurisdictional determinations (PJDs), under which the landowner
concedes jurisdiction to expedite the permitting process, as it is an
AJD. This would represent private landowners relinquishing their
property rights by filing a PJD to expedite the process and give the
Corps the authority to regulate all waterbodies within the proposed
project. Should processing PJDs take the same amount of time as AJDs?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 4.a. If yes, please describe why.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 4.b. If not, what are you doing to ensure this practice

Question from Hon. Doug LaMalfa to Hon. Michael L. Connor, Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Department of the Army

Question 1. I wanted to ask about the status of Section 165(a)
Pilot Program for Water Resources Projects for Small or Disadvantaged
Communities passed in the 2020 WRDA.
Assistant Secretary Connor, what lessons have been learned that
will make this new pilot program more streamlined and efficient?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Questions from Hon. Mark DeSaulnier to Hon. Michael L. Connor,
Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Department of the Army

Question 1. The construction and operation of the Delta Conveyance
Project (DCP) will have profound environmental effects on the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The Delta is a unique and prized National
Heritage Area, and as proposed, I am told the project could
significantly alter the Delta landscapes and waterways, impact family
farms and agricultural operations, and have other noise, air quality,
and environmental effects associated with its disruptive 13 plus years
of construction and ensuing operations. What steps are you taking to
ensure these negative impacts are fully considered as you exercise your
role as the lead federal agency to assure federal compliance with the
National Environmental Policy Act?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2. The EPA Region IX office has reviewed current and past
iterations of the DCP and recommends analysis and disclosure of the
project's secondary effects, including, but not limited to: changes in
the salinity gradient and the location and volume of the low salinity
zone in all seasons; adverse effects on water quality including the
amplification of water quality impairments; disruption of migratory
corridors for salmonids and sturgeon; degradation of aquatic life
beneficial uses; disruption and loss of ecosystem processes; reductions
in cold water supply for migratory fishes in the upper watershed; and
changes to river hydrology. What steps are you taking to ensure that
these concerns are addressed ahead of any work beginning and that these
secondary and cumulative effects receive full consideration?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 3. There has been significant concern expressed by the
constituents I represent and many others in the surrounding areas that
lead agencies were not sufficiently sensitive to the needs of the
communities most affected by the impacts of the project. Please
describe the ongoing efforts that the Corps will undertake to assure
that the concerns of those in communities impacted by the construction
and operation of the project will be solicited and addressed.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 4. The proposed DCP will require issuance of Corps of
Engineers section 408 permits for crossings and alterations of portions
of levee systems that were federally constructed. I am told that the
proposed crossings and alterations may cause subsidence problems,
threatening the integrity and proper functioning of these critical
flood risk reduction systems. Many think it would be better to invest
in maintaining and improving these existing levees, to better protect
the structural integrity of the region's water supply infrastructure.
How will you assure that all alternatives are actively considered in
the proposed DCP?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Questions from Hon. Chris Pappas to Hon. Michael L. Connor, Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Department of the Army

Question 1. I have secured funding through the last two WRDAs to
advance and expedite projects at Portsmouth Harbor, the Piscataqua
River, and Rye Harbor. These harbor dredging projects are cost-
effective efforts to ensure the continued economic viability of our
ports and regional waterways. Our communities have expressed
frustration about the lack of clarity on how Army Corps prioritizes
maintenance dredging projects. For small harbors like those in New
Hampshire, the uncertainty of when harbor dredging may take place has a
significant drag on our harbor authority, ports, and other
stakeholders' ability to make long-term plans. As part of WRDA 2022, I
helped secure a provision requiring the Army Corps of Engineers to
develop clear criteria for evaluating and ranking maintenance dredging
needs for small, remote and subsistence harbors, like those in New
Hampshire.
Can you provide an update on the implementation of this provision?
How will including such criteria in the Corps' annual Civil Works
Direct Program Development Policy Guidance provide improved structure
and transparency for small projects like those in New Hampshire?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2. WRDA 2022 also includes several provisions to improve
coastal resilience, a priority for the communities I represent on New
Hampshire's seacoast. In addition to authorizing the Corps to modify
shore protection projects during emergency restoration activities to
increase resiliency, Section 8103 of the bill also gives the Army Corps
the authority to carry out studies and projects that reduce flood and
hurricane and storm damage hazards. While I am glad to see this policy
change, one broad concern I frequently hear from stakeholders is that
they struggle to easily identify and understand what financial and
technical federal support they may be eligible to receive. To address
this challenge, I introduced a bill, the Increasing Community Access to
Resiliency Grants Act, which requires NOAA to provide states and
localities with easier access to mitigation grants, both within NOAA
and across all federal agencies. I am pleased that the bill was signed
into law as part of the Fiscal Year 2023 NDAA. However, I also know
that outreach to stakeholders is a key pillar in helping communities
access relevant information.
Assistant Secretary Connor, how does the Army Corps work with, and
conduct outreach to, communities to help them identify and develop
projects, such as those that will improve coastal resiliency?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question from Hon. Garret Graves to Hon. Michael L. Connor, Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Department of the Army

Question 1. Please share any details you have about the USACE
implementation of Section 8149 of WRDA 2022? Relatedly, how will USACE
work with the other federal agency that provides the funds to determine
if the funds are eligible? That provision should give flexibility by
allowing non-federal sponsors to leverage certain funds with a federal
imprint for their cost share. Funding with a similar purpose to the
USACE's project mission, such as for coastal protection and restoration
from GOMESA or coastal restoration from the RESTORE Act, should be able
to be leveraged with USACE projects.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Questions from Hon. Rick Larsen to Lieutenant General Scott A.
Spellmon, Chief of Engineers and Commanding General, U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers

Implementation of Everett Harbor Provision: WRDA 2022 added two
projects in Washington State for consideration of federal assumption of
maintenance. Port of Everett and Port Townsend will both benefit from
carrying out channel improvements on their own and remain important for
federal navigation needs.
Question 1. Has the Corps begun an assessment of either of these
navigation channel projects?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2. When can we expect a final report recommending (or not)
federal assumption of maintenance of the channel?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 3. Everett Harbor and the Snohomish River provide a
critical passageway for Navy and Coast Guard exports and access. Can
you commit to considering these nationally significant aspects of the
project when evaluating the economic justification for the channel
improvements?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question from Hon. Chris Pappas to Lieutenant General Scott A.
Spellmon, Chief of Engineers and Commanding General, U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers

Question 1. Many harbor dredging projects must occur on a recurring
basis to address shoaling. Clear expectations on when future
maintenance dredges will occur is critical for local stakeholders. For
example, the Simplex/Tyco shoal in the Piscataqua River has
traditionally been dredged every seven to ten years. These shoals were
last dredged in 2013. I am concerned about delays in completing these
maintenance dredging projects, as shoaling can create significant
safety issues for vessels. In addition to the language requiring the
development of clear criteria for evaluating and ranking maintenance
dredging needs for small harbors, I also secured language in WRDA 2022
directing the Army Corps to specifically expedite this Piscataqua River
project. While I am glad that the Corps will soon begin mobilization on
this project, I remain concerned that small projects like this are
seeing delays and not receiving the attention they deserve.
Lieutenant General Spellmon, will the Corps commit to work with the
Pease Development Authority, which manages our state's harbors, to
determine the timing for future dredging work?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Questions from Hon. Garret Graves to Lieutenant General Scott A.
Spellmon, Chief of Engineers and Commanding General, U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers

Introduction to questions: Section 403 (a)(4) of WRDA 2020
authorized the Port Fourchon Belle Pass Channel Deepening Project. As
we understand it, the feasibility report for this project was drafted
by the non-Federal sponsor under Section 203 of WRDA '86 and approved
by the Secretary in a review assessment dated April 2020. The
Secretary's review assessment contained four conditions that the
Secretary required to be addressed prior to project construction
related to updated cost estimate, the dredge material plan, the real
estate plan, and environmental compliance.
House Report 117-347 to H.R. 7776, WRDA 2022, directed the
Secretary to negotiate and complete a Project Management Plan (PMP)
that is satisfactory to the Secretary and non-Federal sponsor by the
end of Fiscal Year 2022. We understand the first PMP that was presented
was rejected by the non-Federal sponsor as requiring review that is
outside of the scope of the Secretary's four items to be addressed. We
understand a second PMP was proposed, which the non-Federal sponsor
signed in October 2022, with reservations still remaining over the
scope of work. The PMP calls for a Letter Report to be completed by the
District in April 2024, and the draft Report is to be submitted to the
Secretary in June 2024.
Question 1. Please provide an update as to the status of the PMP,
an explanation as to how the PMP addresses the four items referenced as
conditions by the Secretary, and the Corps' explanation as to how those
conditions are being reviewed.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2. Please also provide an update as to whether any
Vertical Team meetings have taken place on this project that has
included the non-Federal sponsor, as requested by the non-Federal
sponsor.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.
