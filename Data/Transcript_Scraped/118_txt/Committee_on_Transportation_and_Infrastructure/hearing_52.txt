II. BACKGROUND

RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE

The United States transportation system, overseen by the
United States Department of Transportation (DOT or Department),
includes 8.8 million miles of public roads and nearly 620,000
bridges, as of 2020.\1\ Of the 8.8 million miles of public
roads, roughly six million lane-miles, or 68 percent, are in
rural areas.\2\ The National transportation system also
includes approximately 970 urban and 1,270 rural and Tribal
public transit operators.\3\ States and local governments own
the vast majority of roads, accounting for roughly 19 percent
and 77 percent, respectively.\4\ The Federal Government owns a
small segment of transportation facilities, mainly located on
Federal lands.\5\

The definition of the term ``rural'' varies across Federal
agencies and programs. Generally speaking, for the purposes of
highway transportation, title 23 of the United States Code
defines ``rural areas'' as those that are not ``urban areas,''
which are subsequently defined as ``designated by the Bureau of
the Census as having a population of 5,000 or more and not
within an urbanized area, within the boundaries to be fixed by
responsible state and local officials in cooperation with each
other, subject to approval by the Secretary [of
Transportation].'' \6\ For purposes of transit, chapter 53 of
title 49 defines ``rural area'' as an area encompassing a
population of less than 50,000 people that has not been
designated in the most recent decennial census as an
``urbanized area'' by the Secretary of Commerce.\7\ However,
many discretionary programs authorized by Congress and overseen
by DOT set specific parameters of what constitutes rural.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transportation networks are essential for the movement of
people and goods across the Nation. In rural areas, residents
tend to drive farther distances to get to work and for goods
and services. According to the Census Bureau, as of 2020,
approximately 66 million Americans lived in rural areas,
equating to about 20 percent of the total population.\8\ While
a smaller share of the total population lives in these areas,
the Census Bureau estimates these communities constitute 97
percent of total land area in the United States.\9\

Rural communities have diverse infrastructure needs. A 2022
TRIP report found that a $180 billion backlog exists for rural
road and bridge needs.\10\ Further, the same report cites that

communities are compared to their urban counterparts.\11\

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION: SELECT PROGRAMS

The Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST)
oversees various discretionary grant programs. On November 15,
2021, the President signed IIJA into law, representing the
largest Federal investment in decades in the United States'
infrastructure.\12\ While the majority of highway funding under
IIJA was distributed to the states via formula, the law
significantly expanded discretionary grant programs
administered by the Secretary, including the creation of
several new programs.\13\ For example, IIJA codified the
Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and
Equity (RAISE) (previously known as TIGER and subsequently
BUILD) program.\14\ The program was initially funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 (P.L.
111-5) and subsequently funded by annual appropriations
legislation.\15\ IIJA requires that not more than 50 percent of
funding under the program go to either projects located in
rural areas or projects located in urbanized areas.\16\ For the
purposes of RAISE, the law defines a ``rural area'' as being
located outside of an urbanized area.\17\

IIJA also statutorily enacted the Rural Opportunities to
Use Transportation for Economic Success (ROUTES)
Initiative.\18\ The ROUTES Initiative was formed in 2019 by DOT
Order 5050.1 to bolster support for rural areas through the
facilitation of grant and loan opportunities and technical
assistance.\19\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally, OST provides guidance for all competitive
discretionary grant programs by first issuing a Notice of
Funding Opportunity (NOFO), which sets forth the eligibilities
under each program. A NOFO may also set forth requirements for
grant applicants to demonstrate effort with respect to
priorities established in executive orders or broader
Administration or DOT-wide goals, in addition to criteria
established by statute.\20\ For example, the Justice40
Initiative (J40), created by President Biden's Executive Order
14008, establishes a goal to devote 40 percent of certain
Federal benefits to funding in disadvantaged communities.\21\
DOT's implementation of J40 affects the decision-making
processes for at least 39 programs and approximately $204
billion in authorized IIJA funding.\22\

DOT has outlined in its FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan its
goals of advancing safety, economic strength and global
competitiveness, equity, climate and sustainability,
transformation, and organizational excellence.\23\ In order to
increase the likelihood of securing a grant award, DOT
encourages applicants generally, and within their NOFOs, to
align applications with DOT's defined strategic goals and to
detail how their respective projects would help DOT achieve
these goals.\24\ While applicants must comply with statutory
requirements for grants, pursuant to the NOFO they will have a
greater chance at securing a grant award if they also meet this
Administration's additional criteria related to equity,
Justice40, and climate change--although some competitive grant
programs also include these same factors as statutory
evaluation criteria.\25\

FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION (FHWA): SELECT PROGRAMS

An estimated 87 percent of funding provided in IIJA to be
overseen by FHWA is distributed to states by formula.\26\ This
funding is important for supporting the vast and disparate
needs of states, including in rural areas. For example, under
IIJA, 55 percent of the Surface Transportation Block Grant
(STBG) formula program is distributed based on population
factors. In the first three years of IIJA, areas below 5,000 in
population received $4.8 billion in funding and areas between
5,000 and 50,000 received an additional $1.9 billion.\27\ Areas
with population under 50,000 received 32 percent of
suballocated STBG funding under IIJA.\28\

IIJA made updates to existing programs and created new
programs and initiatives to support rural infrastructure needs.
The law amended STBG to also allow states to use up to 15
percent of funding per fiscal year on rural minor collectors or
local roads or critical rural freight corridors.\29\ As another
example, for the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway
Projects (INFRA) program, IIJA provided that of the at least 15
percent of funding set aside for small projects with
anticipated costs of less than $100 million, that 30 percent be
for projects to rural areas.\30\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IIJA also created the Rural Surface Transportation Grant
program to support infrastructure projects in rural areas.\31\
The law authorized $2 billion in contract authority for the
program. For the purposes of the program, the law defines a
``rural area,'' as being located outside an urbanized area with
a population of more than 200,000.\32\ Generally, highway,
bridge, or tunnel projects are eligible for funding. The
program requires the Federal cost share of a project not exceed
80 percent, except for projects on the Appalachian Development
Highway System or the Denali Access System, which states may
determine to be eligible for up to 100 percent Federal cost
share.\33\ The law also stipulates set-asides under the
program: not more than 10 percent for projects with awards of
less than $25 million; 25 percent for projects on the
Appalachian Development Highway System; and 15 percent for
projects aimed at addressing fatalities due to lane departures
on rural roads.\34\

RURAL ROADWAY SAFETY

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) in 2021, 40 percent of all traffic
fatalities occurred in rural areas.\35\ A 2022 report by TRIP
looking at rural infrastructure found that traffic crashes and
fatalities on rural non-Interstate roads are disproportionately
high and notes that rural roads are more likely to have narrow
lanes, limited shoulders, sharp curves, exposed hazards,
pavement drop-offs, steep slopes and limited clear zones along
roadsides.\36\ A 2022 report by the Governors Highway Safety
Association and State Farm about the disproportionate rate of
rural fatalities cites several contributing factors, including
lack of safety resources, simpler roadway infrastructure, poor
emergency medical services and behavioral risks including
failure to use a seat belt, impaired driving, speeding and
distraction.\37\

IIJA included initiatives to improve safety outcomes,
including in rural areas. The law increased funding for the
Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), which is focused on
infrastructure projects that enhance safety, to $15.6 billion,
a 34 percent increase when compared to the previous
authorization.\38\ This program includes a special rule for
high risk rural roads, which requires a state to expend HSIP
funds for safety projects on roads that the state determines
pose a significant safety risk pursuant to FHWA guidance.\39\
In fiscal year (FY) 2024, 24 states triggered the special rule,
and $103.7 million was required to be obligated for safety
projects on high risk rural roads.\40\

The law also provides funding for NHTSA, whose grant
programs include those aimed at improving safe driving
behavior, such as preventing impaired driving or distracted
driving. Funding for NHTSA's behavioral programs, which are
funded under the Highway Trust Fund, was increased to $5.1
billion, a 36 percent increase compared to the previous
authorization.\41\ IIJA also provided $1.6 billion in advance
appropriations over five years for NHTSA, much of which is
focused on the agency's behavioral safety work.\42\

FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION: SELECT PROGRAMS

FTA provides Federal financial assistance for Rural Areas
through both mandatory formula funding and the discretionary
competitive grant process.\43\ Title 49, United States Code,
Section 5311 authorizes FTA Formula Grants for Rural Areas and
stipulates that authorized grants may be used for planning,
capital projects, operating costs, job access projects and
public transportation service agreements.\44\ IIJA provides
$4.6 billion for these formula grants over five years. Section
5311(b)(3) further authorizes the Rural Transportation
Assistance Program which may be used for research, technical
assistance and training.\45\ Federal project cost shares are
limited, with exceptions, to 80 percent for capital projects
and administrative expenses and 50 percent for operating
assistance under Section 5311(g).\46\ Eligible recipients of
Section 5311 funding include state and Federally recognized
Indian Tribes; and subrecipients may include state or local
government authorities, nonprofit organizations and public
transportation or intercity bus service operators.\47\

the five-year authorization of IIJA, which may be awarded to
ferry service providers that operate a regular service schedule

Rural transportation plays a critical role in our Nation's
supply chain. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics recently
completed a study that found ``between 2000 and 2019, the
volume of freight (in millions of tons) per year per Interstate
lane-mile grew nine percent in rural areas versus 1.1 percent
in urban areas and that 46 percent of truck vehicle miles
traveled occurred in rural areas.'' \56\ DOT estimates nearly
half of all truck VMT happens on rural roads.\57\

Title 49, United States Code, Section 31111, prohibits

Title 23, United States Code, Section 127, sets forth
maximum vehicle weights for use on the Interstate system, which
is generally 20,000 pounds on a single axle and 34,000 pounds
on a tandem axle. FHWA may withhold up to 50 percent of a
state's apportionment of Federal highway funds if such state
does not permit vehicles on the Interstate system up to these
formula weight maximums.\60\ This withholding provision was
enacted by Congress in 1982 to ensure states would uniformly
allow truck weights up to the Federal maximum.\61\ Similarly,
FHWA may withhold up to 50 percent of a state's apportionment
of Federal highways funds from a state that sets weight limits
on the Interstate system that are higher that these formula
weight maximums, unless a state has a legislative exemption or
is covered under grandfathered allowances. Many rural states
with a large agricultural and forestry presence have truck

statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ERIC A. ``RICK'' CRAWFORD OF
ARKANSAS, CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON HIGHWAYS AND TRANSIT

Mr. Crawford. We are here today to discuss transportation
challenges facing rural areas across the country. Rural
communities are the backbone of America. While they are often
forgotten about, much of the food and fuel consumed by people
across our country is produced in or travels through rural
areas to make it to our urban city centers. Without a strong
transportation network and updated infrastructure, these vital
goods produced by our Nation's farmers, ranchers, and
manufacturers can't be delivered to market for consumers.
The United States Census Bureau estimates around 20 percent
of our Nation's population lives in rural areas. While folks
living in these communities account for a smaller segment of
the overall population, rural areas make up 97 percent of the
total land area in the United States.
Our rural communities are essential to the connectivity of
the Nation, and a robust transportation network of rural
highways and roads ensures that people and goods can freely
move across the country. These communities vary in shape and
size, and have vastly different infrastructure needs than their
urban counterparts.
They also often lack sufficient resources and capacity to
make necessary improvements to infrastructure. A report issued
in 2022 by the nonprofit research group TRIP found there is a
$180 billion backlog in rural road and bridge needs across
America.
Needless to say, formula funding is critical to States and
helps support our rural areas. The States know best what their
individual transportation needs are. For example, the
transportation needs in my home State of Arkansas vary greatly
from the needs of California, Wyoming, or New York. It is
paramount we retain the ability of States to prioritize
projects and address their wide-ranging needs.
That's why the Federal Highway Administration's December
16, 2021, policy memo--which sought to encourage States to
prioritize nonmotorized modes of transit, as well as updating
existing infrastructure over new capacity projects--was so
troubling. Thankfully, after a number of us here in Congress
raised our significant concerns, Federal Highways did the right
thing and superseded their memo.
People who live in rural areas often travel further to
work, the grocery store, and other essential services. For
many, this involves frequently crossing State lines, so, there
must be some recognition of the implications. When one State
proposes policies that have implications on interstate
commerce, it affects travelers in other communities.
It is also unrealistic to think that these communities can
or should prioritize bike lanes and pedestrian projects over
much-needed critical infrastructure. The same 2022 report by
TRIP found that vehicle-miles traveled are 50 percent higher in
rural areas than in urban areas.
While the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA,
made changes to existing programs and included initiatives to
support rural areas, we heard in a full committee hearing
earlier this month about the many challenges that rural
communities face in applying for discretionary grants. IIJA
provided historic funding for the improvement of American
infrastructure. The law significantly expanded discretionary
grant programs. IIJA authorized $196 billion for new and
existing DOT competitive grant programs over 5 years.
Witnesses raised concerns with the high cost of applying
and the lengthy review processes that disproportionately affect
rural America. Concerns were also shared about the ability of
small communities to comply with burdensome Federal permitting
requirements. These barriers, combined with woke policies the
Biden administration has included as part of the Notices of
Funding Opportunity for discretionary grants like Justice40
have seriously undermined the ability of rural communities to
compete for grants. The Biden administration has pushed an
onerous regulatory agenda that is particularly harmful to rural
America.
This includes the Federal Highway Administration's final
rule to create a greenhouse gas performance measure, forcing
State departments of transportation and metropolitan planning
organizations to set declining targets for carbon dioxide
emissions stemming from transportation on the National Highway
System. This rule goes beyond the administration's statutory
authority. The policy was considered and rejected during Senate
negotiations of IIJA. Stakeholders have previously testified
before this subcommittee that this rule will impact project
selections.
Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding how the
rule will impact more rural States with communities that can't
build a subway or bike lanes to cut emissions. These projects
simply don't make sense in communities where the only
congestion and traffic jams are caused by combines or cattle.
I look forward to hearing today from our witnesses
regarding the challenges facing our rural areas, as well as
their thoughts on how we might help address issues at the
Federal level.

Mr. Crawford. I now recognize Ranking Member Holmes Norton
for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA, RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON HIGHWAYS AND
TRANSIT

Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank
subcommittee chair Rick Crawford for holding this hearing on
transportation challenges in rural communities.
One of the many benefits of the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act, the surface transportation portion of which I
helped to shape as the then-chair of this subcommittee, is that
it provides funding for communities of all sizes.
In my district, the District of Columbia, 151 new
transportation projects were started in the first 2 years of
the law alone. This includes $72 million to repair the
Interstate 395 bridge, $35 million to redesign South Capitol
Street, and $20 million for the Wheeler Road Safety Project.
But DC's story is not unique. Similar investments are being
made in every congressional district in America, and the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act includes dedicated
funding for rural transportation.
One example is the Rural Surface Transportation Program. To
date, under this program, the Biden administration has awarded
funds to 30 different projects to rebuild bridges, eliminate
unsafe railway crossings, and increase truck parking.
Another example is the RAISE Program. Fifty percent of the
program funds are dedicated by law to rural areas. The law also
increased funding for our safety programs. While only 19
percent of our U.S. population lives in rural areas, rural
roads account for 43 percent of all traffic fatalities. Reasons
for this disproportionate fatality rate include outdated
infrastructure and unsafe driver behavior.
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act includes a 34-
percent funding increase for the primary infrastructure safety
program, the Highway Safety Improvement Program, and a 36-
percent increase for programs to prevent unsafe behavior like
speeding and drunk driving. The investments will make our roads
much safer.
We also will hear today about the importance of rural
transit. Too often, transit is dismissed as being only relevant
for major metropolitan regions like my own. This is simply not
true. For an elderly resident who relies on the bus to get to a
doctor's appointment, transit is a lifeline. For a person with
a disability who is not able to drive, transit is a lifeline.
For someone who cannot afford a car, transit is a lifeline.
That holds just as true for rural communities as it does big
cities.
According to the Federal Highway Administration, 6.8
percent of households in rural areas, or approximately 4.3
million people, do not drive a car. I appreciate that we will
hear today from Todd Morrow, executive director of a rural
transit system, about the value of transit in rural
communities.
One of the roles of this committee is to ensure that the
Nation's infrastructure is safe and efficient in all
communities. While my congressional district does not include
any rural areas, I appreciate the need to invest in rural
America to ensure the safety of roads and bridges, to ensure
reliable transit service, and to spur economic development.
Those same needs exist for the 81 percent of the country
that live in urban communities. I hope that we, as a committee,
continue to work together to pass infrastructure investments
that improve the lives of all Americans.

[Laughter.]

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. All right. Thank you, Chair
Crawford and Ranking Member Norton, for holding this hearing.
Today's hearing focuses on rural transportation and the
unique experience, needs, and challenges of rural communities
that our infrastructure investments must address. The Census
Bureau estimates that 97 percent of the total land area in the
U.S. is in rural areas. Rural communities are not limited to
any one part of the country and certainly not limited to only
certain States.
The district I represent, which is located north of
Seattle, including none of Seattle, is home to rural
communities, urban communities, and everything in between.
These communities have many shared transportation needs.
At the same time, my rural and smaller communities face
unique challenges. They play a crucial role in our economy.
Many of the first-mile supply chains that need infrastructure
investment to efficiently get goods and products to market, for
instance, are in our rural communities.
Rural communities have unique mobility needs. Residents in
rural counties are aging. In nearly 85 percent of counties,
more than 20 percent of the population is 65 or older.
Rural communities face distinct safety challenges. While
only 19 percent of the U.S. population lives in rural areas,
nearly half of all fatal crashes occur on rural roads. These
realities highlight the quality of life, economic development,
safety, and mobility benefits we can achieve through
investments in rural areas.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is helping rural
communities respond to these challenges. A frequent topic of
this committee is how Federal infrastructure dollars can
advance equity. A key part of realizing equity in
transportation systems is ensuring that smaller communities can
succeed in accessing funding. Smaller communities have limited
funds to design and apply for infrastructure grants and limited
capacity to manage complex permitting and construction. Yet,
smaller jurisdictions in my district and throughout the country
are in great need of investment.
The BIL marked the largest investment in transportation
infrastructure since the 1950s, and it is already paying off in
rural areas. Investing in rural transportation creates jobs
while enhancing transportation connectivity, supporting global
economic competitiveness of our farmers and manufacturers.
A great example of the BIL's investment in rural economies
is through bridge funding. Off-system bridges, those not on the
Federal-aid highway system, have had limited access to Federal
funds. Eighty-seven percent of those bridges are located in
rural areas. The BIL takes steps to address this by including a
15-percent set-aside of each State's bridge formula funding for
use on off-system bridges.
The BIL also created the Bridge Investment Program, which
is delivering results in rural America. One example is the $50
million award DOT made to replace and rebuild six rural bridges
in northwest South Carolina.
The Brookings Institute estimates that BIL invests more
than $338 billion in specific or significant rural investment
opportunities. It includes creating a $2 billion Rural Surface
Transportation Grant program for safety and connectivity of
rural roads; formally establishing the Rural Opportunity to Use
Transportation for Economic Success, or ROUTES initiative, to
better support smaller communities in accessing Federal
resources; dedicating half of the $7.5 billion for the RAISE
grant program to rural areas; and establishing new set-asides
in highway formula programs to direct more Federal funding to
rural roads and bridges.
Another issue I have heard from my constituents and
community leaders about is increasing mobility in rural areas.
Transit is often associated with larger cities, but it is also
very important for rural and smaller communities. Transit
riders don't care about whether the system is classified as
rural, small, small urban, or large urban. They do not care if
they are 1 of the 380,000 annual riders on Island Transit in my
district, or 1 of the 2.5 billion annual riders on New York's
Metropolitan Transit Authority. What they do care about is
getting to their jobs on time, making a doctor's appointment,
or being able to visit friends or family.
That is why the BIL made significant investments in transit
infrastructure nationwide, including $4.6 billion for Rural
Area Transit Formula program, a 42-percent increase over the
prior authorization. The BIL also invests $1 billion to support
ferry service to rural areas--mainly Alaska, I would note.
The BIL also requires that 15 percent of all bus and bus
facility grants go to transit investments in rural areas. And
in my district, Island Transit was awarded $7.5 million in a
grant to design and construct a South Whidbey Island Transit
Center. I don't want to steal Todd Morrow's testimony too much,
but this project is going to create jobs and make travel easier
for residents of Whidbey Island.
Additionally, transit agencies in Skagit and Whatcom
Counties in my district received almost $15 million from the
FTA to upgrade their bus systems. While these agencies serve
small urban areas, they actually do provide quite a bit of
vital service to connecting the surrounding rural communities.
So, I welcome this opportunity to discuss the challenges
facing rural communities and highlighting the ways the BIL is
already working to address the problems. I also appreciate
hearing what programs and funding we may consider in the
upcoming surface authorization to ensure that every community,
no matter the size or location, shares in the benefits of
infrastructure investment.
I want to thank the witnesses for being here today, I look
forward to today's discussion.

A frequent topic of this Committee is how federal infrastructure
dollars can advance equity.
A key part of realizing equity in transportation systems is
ensuring smaller communities can succeed in accessing funding.
Smaller communities have limited funds to design and apply for
infrastructure grants and limited capacity to manage complex permitting
and construction.
Yet, smaller jurisdictions in my district and throughout the
country are in great need of investment.
The BIL marked the largest federal investment in transportation
infrastructure since the 1950s, and it is already paying off.
Investing in rural transportation creates jobs while enhancing
transportation connectivity, which supports the global economic
competitiveness of farmers and manufacturers.
A great example of the BIL's investment into rural economies is
through bridge funding. ``Off-system'' bridges--those not on the
Federal-aid highway system--have had limited access to federal funds.
Eighty-seven percent of those bridges are located in rural areas. The
BIL takes steps to address this by including a 15 percent set-aside of
each State's bridge formula funding for use on off-system bridges.
The BIL also created the Bridge Investment Program, which is
delivering results in rural America. One example is the $50 million
award DOT made to replace and rebuild six rural bridges in northwest
South Carolina.
The Brookings Institute estimates that the BIL invests more than
$338 billion in specific or significant rural investment opportunities.
The BIL directly invests in rural communities by:

Creating a $2 billion Rural Surface Transportation Grant
program for safety and connectivity of rural roads;

Formally establishing the Rural Opportunity to Use
Transportation for Economic Success (ROUTES) initiative, to better
support smaller communities in accessing federal resources;

Dedicating half of the $7.5 billion funding for the RAISE
grant program to rural areas; and,

Establishing new set-asides in highway formula programs
to direct more federal funding to rural roads and bridges.

Another issue I have heard about from my constituents and community
leaders is increasing mobility in rural areas.
Transit is often associated with big cities, but it is just as
important for rural and smaller communities.
Transit riders do not care about whether their system is classified
as rural, small urban, or large urban.
They do not care if they are one of the 380,000 annual riders on
Island Transit in my district, or one of the 2.5 billion annual riders
on New York's Metropolitan Transit Authority.
What they do care about is getting to their jobs on time, making it
to doctor's appointments or being able to visit friends or family.
And that's why the BIL made significant investments in transit
infrastructure nationwide, including $4.6 billion for the Rural Area
Transit Formula Program, a 42 percent increase over the prior
authorization.
The BIL invests $1 billion to support ferry service to rural areas.
The BIL also requires that 15 percent of all Bus and Bus Facilities
grants go to transit investments in rural areas.
In my district, Island Transit was awarded a $7.5 million Bus and
Bus Facilities grant to design and construct the South Whidbey Island
Transit Center.
This project is going to create jobs and make travel easier for the
residents of Whidbey Island.
Additionally, transit agencies in Skagit and Whatcom Counties in my
district received almost $15 million from the FTA to upgrade their bus
systems. While these agencies serve small urban areas, they also
provide vital service to connect surrounding rural communities.
I welcome the opportunity to discuss the challenges facing rural
communities and highlight the ways that the BIL is already working to
address these problems.
I also appreciate hearing what programs and funding we may consider
in the upcoming surface authorization, to ensure that every community,
no matter the size or location, shares in the benefits of
infrastructure investment.
Thank you to all the witnesses for being here today. I look forward
to today's discussion.

Mr. Larsen of Washington. I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. I thank the gentleman. Now I want to welcome
our witnesses and thank them for being here today.
Before we have the formal introductions, I want to briefly
acquaint you with our lighting system. As you can imagine, it
is pretty self-explanatory: green, yellow, red. There are three
lights in front of you. Green means go. But unlike a stoplight,
yellow does not mean proceed with caution, as you might expect.
It means step on the gas, because it is fixing to turn red.
Once it turns red, you might hear a little tap, tap, tap, just
to remind you that your time has expired. So, I just want to
make sure everybody was clear on that and how that lighting
system works.
I ask unanimous consent that the witnesses' full statements
be included in the record.
Without objection, so ordered.
I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing
remain open until such time as our witnesses have provided
answers to any questions that may be submitted to them in
writing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 days for any additional comments and information
submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in the record
of today's hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
As your written testimony has been made part of the record,
the subcommittee asks that you limit your oral remarks to 5
minutes--see the lighting system.
Before our first witness, Mr. Koles, gives his testimony, I
would like to recognize Representative Van Orden to give a
short introduction.
Mr. Van Orden [audio malfunction]. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Transportation and Infrastructure, what is going on here?
Mr. Crawford. That is a comms problem, sir.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Van Orden. Very well. Dang, Army guy's in charge.
Hey, it is great to have another Wisconsinite here. I
appreciate you showing up. There are two of us now, so, we have
got everybody surrounded.
Mr. Michael Koles, from Shawano, Wisconsin, has dedicated
his working life to finding solutions to everyday
transportation infrastructure challenges we experience in
America's Dairyland. After receiving his bachelor's degree in
political science--the one strike against him--from Wartburg
College, and his master's in urban and regional planning from
the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Mr. Koles has spent 26
years committing to improving Wisconsin's transportation
system, specifically for our rural roads.
He currently serves as the executive director of Wisconsin
Towns Association, where he and his team work with State
elected officials to improve transportation, land use,
emergency services, housing, and economic development
conditions for communities across the State. He also served as
the president of the National Association of Towns and
Townships from 2020 to 2022, where he collaborated with the
State and Federal Government to fund our local and minor
collector roads.
Thank you, Mr. Koles, for coming. I appreciate you being
here today. And I understand that you brought cheese for the
entire subcommittee, and we appreciate that greatly. I am
looking forward to hearing your testimony.
Mr. Crawford. And with that, Mr. Koles, you are recognized
for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF MIKE KOLES, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WISCONSIN TOWNS
ASSOCIATION, ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF TOWNS AND
TOWNSHIPS

Mr. Koles. Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Norton,
members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to
testify about the challenges facing rural roads.
I am Mike Koles, the executive director of the Wisconsin
Towns Association. We represent 1,266 rural municipalities that
range in size from a couple square miles to 100 square miles.
Fifty-eight percent of them are home to less than 1,000 people.
Ninety percent of those municipalities are home to less than
2,500 people. So, really rural. I was recently, as
Representative Van Orden noted, president of the National
Association of Towns and Townships. We represent 10,000-plus of
those rural communities.
In the most recent census, as has been noted twice, 19
percent of the population lives in rural areas. The amount of
land that that covers, though, is 97 percent. And maybe even
more striking for this committee, 68 percent of the road-miles
are in that rural area.
In the United States, our interstate system is really the
heart of our system. The veins and the arteries, those are the
State highways. And then those local roads, which are a vast
majority of the entire system, those are our capillaries. In
America's Dairyland--and I don't have cheese for everybody--but
in America's Dairyland, we have a saying: milk doesn't come
from the grocery store. It comes from a farm that is on one of
those capillaries.
We produce a lot of forest products in Wisconsin. The
lumber and also the concrete that we produce helps build
buildings in cities and rural areas alike. That comes off a
capillary.
And I am sure you are all big Packer fans; you know Green
Bay, best team out there, of course. Green Bay is also known as
the toilet paper capital of the world. That pulp comes from
aspen trees that comes off of a capillary that gets that wood
to the Green Bay to turn it into toilet paper. So, ingest a
little bit: without rural roads, you don't have toilet paper,
folks.
An athlete cannot succeed if they have a strong heart and
weak capillaries. I am telling you the rural areas in our
system have those capillaries, and they are weak. We have a
sickness, and that hinders our economy, and that hinders our
safety, as was noted by several Members.
Just a couple of facts. In 2020, 48 percent of the Nation's
arterials and collectors were rated in poor, mediocre, or fair
condition. These arterials and collectors represent only 31
percent of the rural roads; 67 percent of the rural roads are
actually functionally classified as local--so, again, a major
part of the system. A national condition rating for those most
local roads is hard to determine, but in Wisconsin, I can tell
you that 11 percent are in poor condition and 76 percent need
some type of maintenance or construction work.
As for bridges, the story is sort of the same. We have
42,000 bridges in this country that are rated as poor or
structurally deficient. Eighty percent of them are rural.
Interestingly--and not a lot of folks understand this--a bridge
is defined as anything over 20 feet. We have a lot of
structures that are called culverts under 20 feet that act a
lot like bridges. And yet on the local system in this country,
we don't know where they are, we don't know how many there are,
and we have no idea what the safety condition is on them.
And last, about 10 months ago, we had one in Representative
Van Orden's district, a 15-foot culvert, that collapsed under
the weight of a 20-ton fertilizer tender. Nobody got hurt,
thankfully. When they deconstructed the culvert, the engineers
said the newest it was was 1916. So, it was built earlier than
1916.
I will note one final fact. It has been noted already.
Rural roads are significantly more dangerous. The fatality rate
on rural non-interstates is double what it is on others.
I put a lot of solutions in my written materials. I have
included three here that I will note.
First, we need to make sure that the money gets down to the
local level. Right now, we have some wonky definitions: 200,000
is considered rural, and I can tell you that NATaT does not
think that 200,000 people is rural.
We need stable, consistent funding. The FAST Act and IIJA
are necessary investments. We need to make that stable and
growing so that we can plan better, so that contractors can
plan better so that materials suppliers can plan better.
And third, we have to be proactive. The culvert crisis is
one example of where we can either wait for the crisis to
happen or get out ahead of it. Thank you.
[Mr. Koles' prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Mike Koles, Executive Director, Wisconsin Towns
Association, on behalf of the National Association of Towns and
Townships
Introduction
Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Norton, members of the committee,
thank you for the opportunity to speak today about the challenges
facing rural roads. I am Mike Koles, the Executive Director of the
Wisconsin Towns Association. We represent 1,266 rural municipalities
covering the entire rural area of Wisconsin. These municipalities range
in geographic size from a few square miles to over 100 square miles.
Fifty eight percent (58%) of them are home to less than 1,000 people
and 90% have a population less than 2,500.
I am also on the Board of Directors and recently served as
President of the National Association of Towns and Townships, which
represents over 10,000 of these rural local governments across the
country.
In the most the recent Census, 19% of the U.S. population lives in
rural areas, but these communities cover 97% of America's land and are
home to 68% of the nation's road miles. Most of this country and its
lane miles are in what many would erroneously call the middle of
nowhere.
The road system in America can be compared to the human circulatory
system. Any athlete is going to pay close attention to the health of
their circulatory system. They exercise their heart and it pushes the
blood to and from capillaries through arteries and veins. The 60,000
miles of capillaries are the last connection that delivers nutrients
and oxygen to the 30 trillion cells in the human body and the first
connection to transport blood back to the heart and lungs.
While the small eleven ounce heart is important, so are the much
larger 60,000 miles of capillaries. Both are critical if the athlete is
going to be healthy.
In America, our interstate system forms our heart. State highways
function as the transportation system's arteries and veins. And, like
the human circulatory system, our local roads form the critical and
vast majority of our capillaries that serve as the first and last mile
of our economy.
In America's Dairyland, we have a saying, ``milk doesn't come from
the grocery store.'' It comes from a farm on one of those rural
capillaries. The wood and concrete that build our urban areas comes
from a forest or a quarry on one of those rural capillaries. And
although you might know Green Bay for the Packers, it is also the
toilet paper capital of the world. The pulp that produces the toilet
paper comes from the aspen trees that are in a forest on one of those
rural capillaries. Simply, without healthy rural roads, our nation's
citizens don't have much to eat, don't have much for homes or office
buildings, and don't even have toilet paper.
I am here to tell you today that our capillaries have been
neglected and are sick, and that sickness hinders our national economy
and endangers our safety.
Rural Road Composition
According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), in 2020
there were over 6 million rural road lane miles. The lane miles were
distributed as follows in order of functionality: interstate (2.0%);
other freeway (0.4%); principal arterials (3.9%); minor arterials
(4.6%); major collectors (13.6%); minor collectors (8.6%); and local
(66.8%).
Due to the nature of functional classification, most entrances to
farms, fields, forests, quarries, mines, energy producing lands, and
other rural based economic drivers are found in communities with small
populations and on roads functionally classified as minor collectors
and local.
Rural Roads are Critical to the Economy
Based on a 2019 UW-Madison analysis of the economic impact of
agriculture in Wisconsin using the 2017 USDA Census of Agriculture, the
industry is responsible for $104.8 billion in economic activity and
437,700 jobs. This represents 16.4% of Wisconsin's industrial revenues
and 11.8% of employment. Given trends and inflation, economic activity
is expected to be even greater following calculations using the 2022
Census of Agriculture.
Wisconsin is the #1 cheese producer (25% of US total). Over 1,200
cheesemakers produce over 600 types of cheese. The state produces more
potatoes than all but two and is a top producer of snap beans and peas.
The tart cherry crop produced 12.9 million pounds in 2022 and the state
is #1 in cranberry production (60% of the country's total). $3.87
billion in product was exported outside the US (#11 amongst states),
bringing in foreign money that recirculates in the domestic economy
multiple times.
According to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the
forest products industry produces $24.2 billion in industry output and
contributes 130,000 jobs to the state's economy. It is the #1 industry
in 10 of Wisconsin's 72 counties; #1 in employment in 8 counties, and
the #1 industry for value added in 10 counties. These facts speak to
the heavy reliance of certain communities and populations on
traditional rural industries and, thus, rural roads.
Nationally the story is no different. According to a TRIP report:
``Agriculture, food, and related industries . . . contributed $1.2
trillion to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in 2021. This
represents 5.3 percent of overall U.S. GDP.''
A vast majority of the fields and forests that produce the
aforementioned goods, economic impact, and employment are in rural
areas and obtain access from roads functionally classified as minor
collector or local. Furthermore, they are certainly in communities well
below the 200,000 population threshold to be considered eligible for
the U.S. Department of Transportation's Rural Surface Transportation
Grant Program.
Rural Road and Bridge Condition a Concern
In 2020, 12% of the nation's rural arterials and collectors were
rated in poor condition, 19% percent in mediocre condition, 17% in
fair, and only 51% in good. These arterials and collectors represent
only 31% of rural roads. Sixty-seven percent (67%) are functionally
classified as local roads. While a national condition rating for local
roads is hard to determine, in Wisconsin 11% of town roads are in poor
condition and 76% require significant maintenance and reconstruction.
Of the nation's over 618,000 bridges, 70% (435,189) are rural. In
2022, 8% of the nation's rural bridges were rated as poor or
structurally deficient. These are characterized by significant
deterioration of the bridge deck and other major components. It is
frequently not feasible for modern day agriculture, forestry, mining,
or supply chain equipment to use these bridges. Out of all the
country's bridges rated poor or structurally deficient, 80% are rural.
Road and bridge conditions often result in weight postings that
limit the size and weight of farm machinery, school buses, commercial
trucks, and even emergency service vehicles. These weight limits are
used as a strategy to preserve public safety and what little road
remains. Infrastructure users are forced to haul partial loads or
follow longer alternative routes, which can be substantial in rural as
compared to urban areas due to the lack of connectivity and a high
density road grid system. This results in decreased productivity,
greater fuel emissions, increased costs, increased food prices, and
reduced fire and ambulance response times. According to a Pacific
Economic Cooperation Council study, improving the quality of
transportation systems serving the movement of goods from rural to
urban areas is a strategy that should be followed to lower food prices
and increase economic prosperity.
Rural Culverts an Emerging Problem
23 CFR 650.305 defines a bridge as ``having an opening measured
along the center of the roadway of more than 20 feet.'' The nation's
bridges have been located, inventoried, and are regularly inspected for
condition. The federal government provides funding for off-system
bridges, presumably due to the resulting safety and economic concerns
absent the funding.
Any structures under 20 feet are culverts, although colloquially
called many things, such as small bridges or bridge-like structures.
Unlike bridges, except for several states that have championed efforts
to address culverts, we largely don't know where these are, how many
there are, or what condition they are in. Furthermore, outside of a
small pilot program in IIJA (Public Law 117-58) for anadromous fish,
federal funding for stand-alone culvert replacement is lacking.
Despite the 20-foot threshold, many culverts look, act, and
function like a bridge, thus posing the same safety and economic risks.
For example, in the spring of 2023, a 15 foot, 5 inch culvert collapsed
under the weight of 20 ton fertilizer tender in the Town of Farmington,
Wisconsin, in Representative Van Orden's district (below). Luckily
nobody was injured and no fertilizer was spilled in the trout stream.
Human and environmental disasters were avoided. Deconstruction of the
culvert revealed an estimated age of no later than 1916. The structure
was likely built prior to or during WWI.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

In the Town of Bloomfield, Wisconsin, a large dairy farm must
travel nearly 6 miles to go a few hundred feet to access some of its
fields due to a weight limited culvert that spans nearly 20 feet, but
doesn't quite make the length necessary for the town to access state or
federal (below).

Rural Road Safety
Reports from the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA) and
TRIP reveal disturbing rural road safety realities. Fatalities on
rural, non-interstate roads occur at a rate double that on all other
roads. In 2020, rural roads accounted for 2.17 deaths per 100 million
vehicle miles traveled compared to 1.09 deaths on all other roads.
Furthermore, despite only being home to 19% of the population, between
2016 and 2020 almost half of all fatalities took place on rural roads.
During these same years, the risk of dying in a crash was 62% higher on
a rural road than the same trip length on an urban road.
A variety of factors have been found to produce these unfortunate
results. For example, rural roads are more likely to be narrow, have
limited shoulders, sharp curves, and steep ditch slopes. Interestingly,
these are some of the same features that plague efficient agricultural
equipment travel. Limited clear zones in the right-of-way increase the
number and density of obstacles when a vehicle leaves the road.
Lack of safety mechanisms, like low-cost rumble strips that would
help prevent collision with right-of-way obstacles and head-on
collisions, are sorely missing on many rural roads. The GHSA report
states: ``Rural and tribal areas often grapple with limited resources
at all levels. Cash-strapped governments must cover broad geographic
areas that often have few alternative transportation options. Rural and
tribal roads tend to lack safety features . . . Small communities may
not have access to technical expertise--in fact, they may have a single
person tasked with all aspects of public safety, from well water to
road safety to disaster response.''
Lack of resources to employ people to address rural road safety
challenges extends to after accident emergency services. Many
communities are encountering a fire and EMS crisis as decreased
volunteerism and lack of resources to employ full-time emergency
responders is producing an increase in already lengthy response times
resulting from the extreme distances that must be traveled in rural
areas.
Solutions
1.  Adjust the Rural Surface Transportation Grant Program to target
truly rural areas and first mile roads that service the fields,
forests, farms, and quarries that feed the nation and provide building
materials.
IIJA provided $2 billion in STP discretionary grants that are
available to communities either: a) outside of urban areas; or, b)
within urban areas so long as the population is less than 200,000
people. The Wisconsin Towns Association and the National Association of
Towns and Townships feel strongly that a population of 200,000 is not
rural and highly populated communities outside of urban areas are also
not rural.
NATaT supports the Rebuilding Rural Roads Act (H.R. 3002) and
the Protecting Infrastructure Investments for Rural America Act (H.R.
5437) that would change the definition of rural in DOT's Rural Surface
Transportation Grant Program from 200,000 to 20,000.

2.  Build upon the paradigm shift included in the FAST Act to the
STP block grant that allowed states to allocate 15% of funds dedicated
to adjusted census-defined areas that have a population of 50,000 or
lower for projects on roadways functionally classified as either rural
minor collector or local. (23 USC Section 133(g) and (k)).
Roads functionally classified as minor collector and rural
are the first and last mile roads in the US supply chain. These
comprise 75% of the rural roads in the US and over 99% of Wisconsin's
town roads. Previously these roads were not eligible for STP block
grant funding.
Wisconsin Department of Transportation Secretary Craig
Thompson has actively chosen to use this discretion and has deployed
the maximum 15%. This will result in an approximately $15 million
investment over the course of the FAST Act for town roads alone. To
date, $36 million has been awarded to 57 local governments in
Wisconsin. The program has proven extremely popular and is
significantly overprescribed. A total of 1,057 applications were
submitted requesting $856 million. This is a funding overprescription
of 2,378% and speaks to the significant investment need on minor
collector and local roads in smaller communities.

3.  Right size competition for grant funding.
As was noted by the GHSA, rural communities often have one
person that oversees many local government responsibilities. It is not
uncommon in a town to have one or two road patrol people that are
responsible for 50+ miles of plowing, ditch maintenance, and basic
summer road maintenance. They do not have the time or skill set to
prepare a competitive grant application. Furthermore, lack of private
sector grant writing resources and local government funding even when
grant writers are available further plague rural communities. Juxtapose
this with a community of 200,000 that likely has a public works
director and possibly even a grant writer on staff. The much larger
community certainly has an advantage in obtaining both formula and
discretionary funding.
Again, WisDOT has been a leader in addressing this challenge.
The 15% in formula funding noted in recommendation #2 was suballocated
to different municipal types, thus, for example, preventing a city of
50,000 people from competing with a town of 250.

4.  Consider targeted changes to the quality based selection
process.
When rural communities do muster the resources to hire out
project scoping and grant writing, the current quality based selection
process requirement significantly diminishes the supply of engineering
firms willing to do such work. Firms that assist in project scoping and
grant writing are typically prohibited from providing the much higher
profit margin engineering services to the community. This exacerbates
the already existing shortage of engineering firms to assist small
communities in an attempt to compete with larger communities.

5.  Continue the FAST Act and IIJA investment in bridge funding.
In addition to the increased funding in the FAST Act, the
required off-system set aside was increased from 15% to 20%. Both are a
welcome increase and should be continued in a future authorization. The
IIJA created a new Bridge Formula Program (BFP) that, in Wisconsin's
case, awarded $45 million annually ($225 million total). Under BFP, a
minimum of 15% must be spent on off-system bridges and projects must be
funded at 100%federal participation. WisDOT chose to exceed the 15%
minimum and allocate $180 million to date to local off-system bridges
resulting in 330 bridge projects that are 100% federally funded. Based
on conversations with my colleagues on the NATaT Board, WisDOT's
actions are an anomaly.

6.  Increase funds for the federal bridge program and create a
carve-out to include off-system non-state structures less than 20 feet,
which states must distribute through a competitive process.

7.  Create a program modeled after Wisconsin's Agricultural Road
Improvement Program.
Wisconsin recently created a $150 million pilot program to
increase agricultural supply chain efficiencies through reconstruction
of roads functionally classified as minor collector and local that are
subject to weight limits. Reconstructed roads can no longer be subject
to a weight limit. This program will prove the first step in creating
priority agricultural routes on which farmers, loggers, and processors
will be able to carry full weights throughout the year.

8.  Achieve a stable, consistent, and enhanced funding stream.
In 2021, FHWA estimated the US faces a $180 billion backlog
in rural road and bridge maintenance and construction. Investments in
the FAST Act and IIJA are a welcome and necessary injection that must
continue. The enhanced funding is necessary; however, achieving greater
consistency and stability is needed to empower local governments to
engage in more effective planning and move toward an asset management
approach to managing their infrastructure. Furthermore, this would
allow materials suppliers, engineers, and contractors to more
efficiently prepare, which would avoid infrastructure construction and
maintenance pricing bubbles.

Mr. Crawford. Thank you, and I now recognize our ranking
member for the introduction of our next--oh, I am sorry. We are
going to jump to Mr. Greteman.
You are recognized for 5 minutes. My apologies.

TESTIMONY OF JEFF GRETEMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, WINDSTAR LINES, ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN BUS
ASSOCIATION

Mr. Greteman. No problem.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Norton, members
of the committee. My name is Jeff Greteman. I am the president
of Windstar Lines, a family-owned charter bus company based out
of Carroll, Iowa. I appreciate the opportunity to testify about
rural transportation challenges and the importance of bus
operations in meeting the public transportation needs of rural
communities.
The timing of this hearing is important, as private bus
operators are facing increased challenges to provide these
vital services. The goal for the transportation policymakers is
to support a connected, nationwide transportation service for
the public. Private bus operators, both charter operators like
Windstar and scheduled service operators, play a critical role
in this system, ensuring rural communities have access to vital
services, educational and job opportunities, and connections to
the broader national transportation network in a safe, cost
effective, and environmentally friendly manner.
However, the operating environment for bus operators is
deteriorating rapidly, and the COVID pandemic took a toll. Bus
operators are increasingly losing access to key facilities
which provide intermodal connections, and many of these
facilities are publicly funded.
Also, we are seeing jurisdictions restricting access
through zoning or other means to prevent rural operators from
establishing safe pickup and dropoff points that provide
meaningful connections to other services. There is statutory
language to prevent these restrictions, but these entities are
finding ways around it.
Recognizing intercity bus service provides an essential
link between rural communities and the rest of the Nation, the
Federal Government created the 5311(f) program because major
intercity bus carriers were forced to abandon less productive
routes. But the program has not kept up with today's costs and
business environment, putting bus operators who participate in
the program at increased risk of abandoning these routes or
face going out of business. These issues put a strain on rural
operators.
As well, there are basic infrastructure needs in rural
States. Congestion and potholes are not solely the problem of
large urban areas, and rural States need the flexibility to
choose the infrastructure investments that best fit their
needs. For this reason, Mr. Chairman, we support your
legislation addressing the recent Federal highway rule that
could limit a State's ability to make infrastructure investment
decisions such as adding capacity when appropriate.
Just one example is completing the four-laning of Highway
30, which runs through my hometown in Iowa. Highway 30 is the
most heavily trafficked route outside of Interstate 80.
Limiting our State's ability to determine when Highway 30 gets
its last miles four-laned is unneeded Federal oversight and
should be left in the hands of local and State officials.
We are also challenged by resource issues. As you have
likely heard, we face staffing shortages. Finding qualified
drivers is one of the biggest challenges to bus operators
today, and in rural areas, this is more difficult due to lack
of CDL testing sites and the time it takes to obtain a CDL.
Additionally, there are a number of broader challenges we
face that are not just limited to rural operators, but pose a
threat to the entire private bus industry. Bus operators and
CMV operators in general engaging in interstate operations are
wholly dependent on a national, uniform safety scheme. The
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations work, and they work
because the operators can cross State lines without the risk of
running into differing individual State rules and regulations.
Because of this uniformity, national safety standards
remain in place and all operators play by the same rules. For
this reason, we oppose any effort by the FMCSA to waive its
preemption of State rules concerning drivers' hours of service.
Windstar operates in the lower 48 States, and the burden to
keep up with 48 different hours-of-service schemes would be
overwhelming. We can't operate with a patchwork of hours-of-
service regulations. We need a national standard.
Finally, the bus industry has a long and successful
environmental track record taking cars off the road and
relieving congestion. We are proud of these efforts, and
support addressing climate change issues. However, recent
policy initiatives and regulations to push CMV owners toward
ZEV technology, although well-intended, are unrealistic for the
bus industry. Please understand, we are not opposed to cleaner
vehicles, but the transition requires a more reasonable
timeline with realistic expectations for our industry.
For bus operations, the technology is still under
development. Appropriate charging infrastructure is not yet in
place. The cost to transition to ZEVs is also significant,
particularly for an industry dominated by private small
business. Right now, the cost of an electric bus is twice the
cost of a diesel bus, and the price is even higher for
hydrogen, and the cost for the infrastructure, coordinating
with power suppliers, and training for staff to maintain the
fleet.
Also, current EVs on the market can't meet the capacity
range of diesel vehicles we have no idea on the resale value.
Investment of this sort is very risky for small businesses, and
especially for rural operators already struggling to remain in
operation. Robust funding is available for transit and
schoolbus industries, but once again, the private bus industry
is being left out. We want to be supportive. However, we need
more reasonable timelines and resources.
I will close by saying if rural bus services are to survive
long term, there needs to be greater recognition of the
critical role we play in the national transportation network
and the very real challenges we are facing.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would be pleased to answer any
questions.
[Mr. Greteman's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Jeff Greteman, President and Chief Executive
Officer, Windstar Lines, on behalf of the American Bus Association
Good morning Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Norton, and members of
the Subcommittee. My name is Jeff Greteman, and I am president of
Windstar Lines, a private bus operator based out of Carroll, Iowa.
I appreciate this opportunity to testify today about rural
transportation challenges, and the importance of private bus operations
in meeting the public transportation needs of rural communities, both
on behalf of my company and the entire industry, representing the
American Bus Association.
The private bus industry has a long and respected history serving
the traveling public in this country, although not often recognized for
its contributions. It is an industry dominated by small businesses,
often family owned like Windstar, which provides a vital service as
part of the larger national transportation network. Private bus
operations include scheduled route services, like Greyhound, but also
commuter and shuttle services in and around urban areas and work sites,
and charter operations, like Windstar, which operate locally or across
the country. Private bus operators also are relied upon by the public
for transportation services, and we move our military and serve in
times of disasters to assist with evacuations and recovery in the
aftermath.
Windstar Lines provides charter bus service, contract commuter
service, employee shuttles, and convention transportation support, and
we are certified to move our military by the Department of Defense. We
are a family owned and operated business based in Carroll, Iowa, with
11 additional locations nationwide. We transport approximately 1.5
million passengers annually, while maintaining an exemplary safety
record. However, I am also here to speak on behalf of all rural bus
operations, including scheduled operations that serve rural communities
and work with state and local governments to ensure these communities
have adequate public transportation services.
During the COVID-19 pandemic the private bus industry suffered
staggering losses, close to $12 billion in 2020, alone, and it is still
struggling to recover--this is particularly true for rural operators
and the vital services we provide. Although Congress enacted the
Coronavirus Economic Relief for Transportation Services Act or CERTS in
2021, to assist private operators the industry was left primarily to
rely on its own resources to survive the Pandemic. Yet, at the same
time, private operators played a critical role, shuttling necessary
medical personnel to high-risk areas, connecting rural communities to
medical facilities in larger urban areas, and assisting those who faced
dire economic circumstances by providing reliable and cost-effective
transportation services. From a rural standpoint, this was particularly
important, as private bus operations provide a vital link for rural and
otherwise isolated communities to the larger national transportation
network, urban hubs and facilities, and access to medical and
educational resources and jobs.
However, although critical to serving the transportation needs of
rural communities, the operating environment for bus operations is
deteriorating. Companies are struggling to remain viable, which is
becoming increasingly difficult to do.
Rural bus operators like Windstar are facing various strains on
their operations. As is well documented, the bus driver shortage is
making it difficult to meet staffing needs. However, in the Midwest,
because of the lack of availability of Commercial Driver License (CDL)
testing facilities and CDL training facilities for bus operators, it
makes it even more difficult to attract drivers to the profession.
Further, federal CDL requirements for testing, requiring lengthy waits
between testing and obtaining a license, are disincentives to pursuing
a CDL.
Additionally, roadway infrastructure needs are very important to
rural operations. Congestion and potholes are not solely the province
of large urban areas. Rural States face similar issues and should have
the discretion to address their transportation needs as they see fit,
including adding capacity if appropriate to address inefficiencies as
well as safety. For example, Highway 30 runs from the east to west
border of Iowa, and is the second most traveled roadway in the state
after I-80. It is the state's longest roadway and connects major cities
such as Cedar Rapids and Ames, and serves over 550,000 of Iowa's 3.1
million population. However, over 80 miles of it remains two-lane,
which causes safety concerns, congestion, and operational
inefficiencies for businesses like Windstar that depend on it. The
Highway 30 Coalition is advocating for the State to modernize this
roadway and add capacity to make it a 4-lane highway.
This project is specific to my state, and states need to have the
flexibility to identify their own infrastructure needs and make these
types of decisions. For this reason, Mr. Chairman, we wholly support
your legislation, H.J.Res. 114, to stop the Federal Highway
Administration's final rule imposing national performance measures
concerning greenhouse gas emissions, on states and transportation
planning agencies. Rural states have unique needs and should not be
forced into a ``one-size-fits-all'' mandate restricting their ability
to provide critical transportation investments to meet their
transportation needs. Unlike urban areas, bike lanes and transit rail
are not always an option for rural communities--we, as public
transportation providers, need highway capacity, and I want to thank
the Chairman for recognizing this and for his legislation.
Another significant issue is that bus operators are losing access
to key facilities and destination points providing intermodal
connections, and many of these facilities are publicly funded
facilities like transit stations, Amtrak stations and airports, which
should welcome and promote intermodal transportation. Although there is
statutory language \i\ requiring these public facilities to provide
reasonable access to intercity bus operators, facilities have found
ways to get around the law due to gaps in the law or interpretive
guidance. This is a major concern for rural bus operators who are
trying to ensure their passengers have meaningful connections to the
larger national transportation network. Efforts to work with federal
partners like the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) or the Federal
Aviation Administration, have proven unsuccessful either because the
law is insufficient or because of disinterest.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\i\ See, 49 USC 5323(r) and 49 USC 47107(a)(20).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similarly, rural bus operators are increasingly facing restrictions
from the local jurisdictions they are trying to serve, in terms of
destination points or pick-up/drop-off locations. The changing business
environment for intercity bus operations has led to numerous bus
station closings, and while operators seek to relocate many localities
are restricting or prohibiting these efforts. For example, rather than
permit bus operators to relocate to areas that provide amenities and
meaningful connections to other transportation services, they are
instead restricting bus stopping points to industrial areas with few
amenities and no intermodal access, resulting in less attractive bus
service and hurting both the passengers and the bus operator.
The private bus industry prides itself on being one of the few
publicly accessible intercity modes of transportation servicing rural
communities, ensuring equitable access to the national transportation
network in a safe and cost-effective manner. However, if bus operators
cannot provide necessary transportation connections and attractive
service to customers, the operating model is unsustainable and rural
communities will suffer.
Also, federal programs like the 5311(f) rural transportation grant
program, managed by FTA, are not keeping up with the costs and business
case to support rural transportation bus routes. The funding formula
for use of 5311(f) funds is insufficient for subsidizing rural route
operations. Increased requirements, like the Buy America requirement,
and supply chain issues have increased costs for equipment
significantly. Currently, there is only one manufacturer who can supply
compliant equipment, and costs for equipment have increased by over
30%. These cost increases, in turn, cut into funds otherwise relied on
to cover operating loss costs.
As well, the formula funding for operating loss subsidies,
typically 50% of net operating losses, does not fully account for the
actual costs to private operators to provide services on routes that
would not otherwise exist. By definition, the remaining 50% of net
operating losses are unfunded and often require the private operator to
subsidize the route, an increasingly difficult burden to carry. The
5311(f) program was initially created to prevent intercity bus
operators from abandoning less productive routes. However, we are at a
point where the program is not meeting its goals. Operators providing
5311(f) services these days need greater support to sustain their
businesses if they are to continue operating such routes and remain
viable rural transportation providers. It would also help if States
were limited from certifying and transfer these vital funds to other
programs when they could be used to provide increased support for rural
transportation in other states. Better coordination between the states
in support of rural interstate transportation instead of an intrastate-
only focus, could also lead to better results for this important
transportation lifeline and better connections for passengers to the
national transportation network.
In addition to these various challenges for rural operators, the
viability of the entire private bus industry is at risk from a number
of current regulatory initiatives and policy directions. These
initiatives appear to reflect a lack of understanding of bus operations
and take no account of the valuable services and benefits private bus
operators contribute to our country.
Bus operators, as well as commercial motor vehicle operators in
general that engage in interstate operations, are wholly dependent on a
national, uniform regulatory safety scheme. This scheme is a hallmark
of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's (FMCSA's) safety
oversight role. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations or FMCSRS
work, and they work because operators can cross state lines without the
risk of running afoul of differing individual state rules and
regulations. Because of this uniform scheme, national safety standards
remain in place and all operators must play by the same rules. However,
FMCSA is currently entertaining waiver requests to set aside its
preemption determination of state ordinances that differ from the
national scheme and interfere with their jurisdiction over drivers'
hours of service. If FMCSA proceeds to waive its preemption
determination and allow states to set their own rules, bus operators
like Windstar will be burdened with trying to navigate new rules every
time they cross state lines or be faced with heavy penalties and
litigation. This is entirely unworkable from a business standpoint, in
terms of engaging in interstate operations. Windstar currently operates
in the 48 contiguous states; the burden of trying to remain compliant
with 48 different HOS schemes would be overwhelming.
Finally, Mr. Chairman, the bus industry has a long and successful
environmental track record, taking cars off the roads and relieving
congestion, along with adopting cleaner engine technology and cleaner
fuels. We are proud of these measures, and certainly are supportive of
addressing climate changes issues. However, recent policy initiatives
and regulations to drive the commercial vehicle industry transition to
zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) technology, albeit well intended, are
unrealistic for the bus industry.
Increasingly stringent emissions requirements pursued by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and sometimes driven by or even
superseded by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and like
states, are a serious threat to our industry. These agencies seem to
take no account of the environmental benefits the bus industry
currently provides, in the development of their rules, nor do they
consider the costs for new heavy-duty ZEVS and the need for reasonable
timelines. In fact, neither EPA nor CARB has made any concerted
outreach to the private bus industry to understand our operations or
the burdens we face from their rules.
Right now, for motorcoach vehicles, zero emissions technology is
still under development--and it is unclear whether batteries or
hydrogen fuel cells will be the best fit for such vehicles. Also,
appropriate charging infrastructure is not yet in place, and very
little attention is being paid to what infrastructure is necessary--in
terms of charging capacity, speed, space, and the needs of passenger
carrying vehicles. Further, the costs for our industry to transition to
ZEVs are significant, particularly for an industry dominated by small
businesses, who continue to struggle with recovery from the pandemic.
Currently, the cost of an electric bus is two times the cost of a
regular diesel vehicle ($600K v. $1.5 million), and the price is even
higher for a hydrogen vehicle ($2 million+). Then there is also the
cost for installation of onsite charging infrastructure and training
for staff, to consider, in order to maintain the fleet. Further, the
current ZEV vehicles on the market cannot meet the capacity or the
range of diesel operated vehicles, which is particularly problematic in
terms of providing rural transportation services. Lastly, purchases of
bus equipment are a significant investment for bus operators, who also
take into account the resale value of the equipment--which is a known
quantity for vehicles on the market today. This is not the case for an
electric bus or ZEV vehicle, where resale value has yet to be
determined.
Investment of the sort necessary to transition an industry to an
entirely new power mode is very risky for small businesses, and
especially for rural operators who are already struggling to remain in
operation. Although legislation has authorized various grant programs
for ZEV investment, none of these programs will assist the private bus
industry with such a transition. Please understand, we want to be
supportive and are not opposed to moving toward cleaner vehicles, but
this transition needs to happen on a more reasonable timeline, with
more resources, and with realistic expectations for our industry.
Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you, again, for holding this hearing
and allowing me to testify about rural transportation services. I will
close by saying the private bus industry provides critical public
transportation services to rural and isolated communities. However, if
rural bus operators are to survive, there needs to be greater
recognition of the critical role we play in the national transportation
network and the very real challenges we are facing.
I would be pleased to answer any questions.

Mr. Crawford. Thank you, sir, and I now recognize the
ranking member for an introduction of our next panelist.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I am
pleased to introduce Mr. Todd Morrow, the executive director
for Island Transit, which provides safe, reliable, and
accessible transportation services for more than 380,000 riders
in Island County, Washington State, each year.
Todd is a seasoned leader in the transit industry with 23
years of experience. And I knew him before then, as well.
Throughout his career, he has worked to promote public
transportation at the local, State, and Federal level. In his
role as Island Transit's executive director, Todd has helped
the agency weather the pandemic, and he has secured funding for
capital projects that will improve service for community
members on the island. He has guided the agency through the
interagency process by moving towards a zero-emission fleet, as
well as implementing sustainable energy practices.
He's also focused on increasing Island Transit's service,
adding Sunday service for the first time in the agency's
history. Morrow's leadership extends to various industry roles,
as well, including past presidency of the Washington State
Transportation Association's board of directors, and he
continues to be an integral part of The Bus Coalition, serving
as the treasurer.
I want to thank him for making the trip out, and look
forward to hearing his testimony.
Thanks, Todd.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you.
Mr. Morrow, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF TODD MORROW, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ISLAND TRANSIT,
ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY TRANSPORTATION ASSOCIATION OF
AMERICA

Mr. Morrow. Thank you very much. Chair Crawford, Ranking
Member Larsen, and committee members, thank you for this
opportunity to discuss rural transit. I am Todd Morrow,
executive director of Island Transit. I am here representing
the 1,200 members of CTAA, otherwise known as the Community
Transportation Association of America, the majority of which
are rural public transit systems.
My public transit agency serves Island County, a rural
county of 86,000 northwest of Seattle. Island County has the
most visited State park in Washington and is the home of Naval
Air Station Whidbey Island. As a rural transit agency, we
receive our Federal funding through our State department of
transportation. Island Transit has a $21 million annual budget,
63 buses, 136 employees, 16 bus routes, and an operating base
on each of our two islands. We provide traditional, on-demand,
paratransit, and vanpool service. We carry approximately 7,500
passenger trips an average week; 13 percent of those are ADA
paratransit trips for those receiving door-to-door service.
Popular destinations include grocery stores, local hospital,
Walmart, restaurants, schools, and the Washington State Ferry
for Boeing and Microsoft workers.
Just as in urban areas, people need access to those places.
This is especially true for vulnerable Americans, older adults,
persons with disabilities, and low-income individuals.
Everything we do is about safely and equitably moving people.
We are currently growing our service. Last June, we began bus
service on Sundays for the first time.
We are unique because we are zero fare. Our agency receives
70 percent of our operating revenue from voter-approved,
locally collected sales tax.
The recent increases in Federal transit funding are making
it possible for Island Transit to move two critical projects
forward. One is our South Whidbey Transit Center project, which
will create a safe place for off-street transfers. The Federal
Transportation Administration awarded at $7.5 million.
Like urban systems, rural systems need modern facilities.
Competitive bus and bus facilities funding makes that possible.
One challenge that occurs with facility building is that
transit, unlike highway projects, is required to complete the
environmental process prior to purchasing the property.
Our other major project is transitioning our fleet to zero-
emission vehicles. We have seven battery-electric vehicles in
our fleet already, solar panels on our two operating bases, and
battery charging at our main operating base.
Another challenge is the availability of vehicles. Our
agency's current purchase of nine more electric vans is in
limbo because manufacturers have gone out of business. Vehicle
prices, particularly for these small vehicles that rural
systems depend on, have dramatically increased.
This shortage also impacts large buses, particularly
hydrogen fuel cell buses. There is just one Buy America-
compliant manufacturer of hydrogen buses. This year, we will be
requesting Federal funding to purchase 12 of those full-size
hydrogen buses.
Both Island Transit and CTAA support the Federal Transit
Administration's recent prioritization of progress payments to
bus manufacturers to help them with their cash flow challenges.
We would welcome strategies to increase access to new bus
manufacturers while they become Buy America-compliant.
For rural systems, the fleet transition is challenging
because advances in zero-emission technology have not
successfully reached the smaller class of vehicles we use.
Their battery range is low. Charging infrastructure, too, is
just not as prevalent yet in rural America.
The capacity of our local power grid and grid resiliency is
also a concern. To address this, my agency has purchased
acreage adjacent to our operating base, with the potential for
siting a microgrid there for possible additional electricity.
Recruitment is challenging for transit agencies, as well.
We see two places where the Federal Government could help us.
One is to fast-track the certification of oral testing labs for
our required drug and alcohol testing. CTAA requests members of
this committee send a letter to HHS to urge them to finish this
important work.
Another area is the requirement for a commercial driver's
license. We need an addition to the CDL passenger endorsement
that is focused on bus driving and public transit.
I would like to end by introducing you to one of Island
Transit's bus riders, James, a veteran turned veterans
advocate. He said, ``Island Transit gives people like me, a
vet, a chance to get to where I need to go and help others.
Without Island Transit, I couldn't do what I do.''
I would like to thank you for inviting me to speak to you
today.
[Mr. Morrow's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Todd Morrow, Executive Director, Island Transit,
on behalf of the Community Transportation Association of America
Chair Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, Committee Members:
Thank you for this opportunity to share the challenges and
opportunities facing rural transit providers. I am Todd Morrow,
Executive Director of Island Transit. I'm here representing the more
than 1,200 members of the Community Transportation Association of
America (CTAA)--the majority of which are rural public transit systems.
I am also a Board Officer of The Bus Coalition and the past chair of
the Washington State Transit Association.
Island Transit Basics
``When you have seen one transit agency you have seen one transit
agency'' is a common phrase in our industry and aptly describes Island
Transit. Island Transit serves Island County, a rural county northwest
of Seattle which includes two large islands. One, Whidbey Island, is
the fourth longest in the lower 48. This ``long-ness'' and island
geography significantly impacts our operations. To get to our other
island, we travel through two other counties. There are only four
gateways to our islands, two of them are via Washington State Ferries
and the others are by way of bridges, including the iconic Deception
Pass bridge. Island Transit helps to mitigate the congestion through
those entry points by the bus routes we provide.
Island County has the most visited state park in Washington state.
We are the proud home to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island and have a
thriving agriculture, arts, and hospitality industry. 86,000 people
call Island County home. For federal purposes we are categorized as a
rural transit agency and receive our federal funding through our state
Department of Transportation.
Island Transit has an annual budget of $21 million, a fleet of more
than 60 buses, a staff of 136, sixteen bus routes, and an operating
base on each island. We provide traditional and on-demand bus service,
paratransit, and vanpool service. We are governed by a Board of
Directors composed of local elected officials and a union
representative.
Our route that travels from our largest town, Oak Harbor, to the
ferry terminal in Clinton, is our longest. It covers nearly the length
of Whidbey Island and is approximately 40 miles long. It runs hourly
and carries the most passengers of any of our routes (1,798 an average
weekday). The one-way trip lasts about one hour and forty five minutes.
We also have long routes connecting our islands to transit systems and
larger cities on the mainland.
Popular destinations in Island Transit's service area include the
Washington State Ferries for those who work off island, at Boeing and
Microsoft. Our popular on-island destinations include our local
hospital, grocery stores, Walmart, restaurants, and schools. We also
cater to tourists and bicyclists with our summer state park service.
We are somewhat unique among the nation's rural transit providers
because we are fare-less and began that way when our service started in
the 1980s. Our agency receives approximately 70% of our operating
revenue from a voter-approved, locally collected sales tax, which is at
the highest level allowed by state law. The rest of our capital and
operating revenue comes from federal and state funds. During the COVID
era Island Transit received more than $16 million from the federal
government's pandemic relief spending. Those funds made it possible to
not furlough staff, among other things. During that time there was a
disproportionately high portion of our budget that came from federal
programs.
Being fare free has many positives for the operations of Island
Transit. The most important is that it removes the fare as a barrier,
so that all can have access to the mobility we provide. Even if one can
afford a bus fare, simply worrying about how much it is and when to
pay, presents a psychological barrier to some. Fare free also
transforms the role of Coach Operator. Rather than having to check and
enforce each passenger's payment of a fare, that driver can instead
focus on helping the customer. This is especially important for the
tourists and first-time riders. Finally, not charging a fare negates
the cost of having to account for the fares collected, which in some
cases may just barely cover that accounting cost.
Demographics of Island Transit's Service Area
Island County has several notable demographic realities that shape
Island Transit's service and its importance. The 2020 US Census Bureau
identified that almost 25% of the county's population was age 65 years
or older. That is significantly higher than the state and national
average of 16% for the elderly population group. 13% of the population
identified as veterans, and 15.5% identified as having a disability.
All of these factors underscore the need for scheduled fixed-route and
especially paratransit service to ensure the mobility of these
populations. To efficiently serve these groups we are oftentimes
combining our ADA paratransit trips with those on our new on-demand
service. Public transportation allows seniors to age in-place in their
homes, something many prefer and is less costly than assisted living
senior housing.
Economic Impact
The impact of Island Transit on our local economy is threefold: one
is from our payroll's impact on the local economy, as one of the larger
employers in the county. Another economic impact stems from our
construction projects and spending on our service, which generates
business in our county. Our service is also beneficial to area
businesses, including in the hospitality sector, by making it easier
for their customers and workers to access them.
An example of our impact in the tourism industry is when Island
Transit began service 7 days a week, including Sundays. Because of our
daily operations, our islands can now be advertised as a place to visit
every day of the week without an automobile, making it possible for
even the transit dependent to enjoy them. Related to that, we started
summer service which connects our state parks easily by bus, helping to
address congestion and providing access for all.
Another example of the role that transit plays in supporting the
local economy is Island Transit's South Whidbey Transit Center project.
This project is the recipient of recently awarded Congressionally
Directed Spending and of a Federal Transit Administration bus and bus
facility (Section 5339) grant. It will support area businesses by
making it easier for customers and workers to access them, and it will
provide access to a new pedestrian and bike path to the ferry terminal.
Visitors to the island (as well as residents who are traveling for
work) will have a convenient place to leave their car and travel
hassle-free by transit, enjoying the scenic beauty and arts and culture
of the island.
During the pandemic, the important role of Island Transit was
underscored, as was the case with other transit agencies across
America. Essential workers (including hospital workers, first
responders, and store employees) still needed to get to their jobs.
Others still needed to travel to their medical appointments, grocery
stores, pharmacies, and so on. Transit, including Island Transit was
there to provide that service and did not shut down. Importantly, as a
larger employer, we also kept our workforce employed, in part because
we knew the importance of our payroll to the local economy.
The Value of Rural Transit
One of the challenges of rural transit is that destinations are
farther apart requiring long routes, all in areas with low population
density. But transportation in rural areas is just as important as
transit in big cities. People in rural areas, as in urban areas, need
access to health care, places of employment, goods, and services. This
is especially true for vulnerable Americans: older adults, persons with
disabilities, low-income individuals, and others.
In rural areas, these long routes increase the cost of bus service.
Island Transit, like all rural providers, seeks ways to efficiently
provide our services. This includes using small bus vehicles and
combining traditional, scheduled trips with those serving disabled
passengers.
Island Transit Today
Everything Island Transit does is about safely and equitably moving
people. And we are currently growing our service. Last June, Island
Transit began bus service on Sundays for the first time. We expect to
add more hours to our service day, to support those who work later once
we have hired more staff.
This service growth began with an analysis of the financial
sustainability of our operating revenue, followed by a route network
analysis, called Island Transit Maximized. That work has made it
possible to replace some of our scheduled trips with a more efficient
on-demand service, as well as provide service on Sundays and in new
places. On demand service is an increasingly common form of service
that involves the customer scheduling their bus trip, rather than
expecting a bus at a pre-set time. The scheduling occurs using an
application on a smartphone or computer, or by calling dispatch. With
these trips being scheduled for a particular rider, a bus is not out
circulating empty.
As we add service, ridership on the Island Transit system has
grown. This is normal in the transportation industry. Unfortunately,
many rural transit systems are not in a position to add more service.
Island Transit's financial sustainability analysis showed that the
agency has the capacity to provide more services.
During the past 12 month period, Island Transit carried on average
7,485 passengers trips each week. 13% of those trips were paratransit
trips. We had the highest ridership in the month of August last year,
after we added service on Sundays, with 37,507 passenger trips for that
entire month.
Island Transit has embarked on a 17-year plan to replace our
current fleet with both hydrogen and battery electric vehicles. We need
hydrogen buses because they work on our long routes and are not
dependent on an electrical grid that is susceptible to long power
outages from storms. Federal investment makes this transition possible.
We have 5 battery electric sedans for our vanpool program. We have also
installed solar panels on our two operating bases and battery charging
at our main operating base. We just received two battery electric, ADA
accessible vans and have nine more on order, funded by a grant that
includes state and federal funds.
Challenge: Vehicle Availability and Cost
This gets to our first challenge: The availability of vehicles,
which has been severely impacted by a bus manufacturing shortage and
supply chain issues. My agency's order of nine more vehicles is in
limbo because the manufacturer has gone out of business. We are having
difficulty finding another vehicle model to replace those, one with
adequate range. Vehicle prices, particularly for the small vehicles
that rural systems depend on, have dramatically increased, creating
another challenge.
This manufacturing shortage also impacts large buses, particularly
hydrogen vehicles. There is just one Buy America compliant bus
manufacturer of hydrogen buses, its competitor having recently stopped
production. This year we will be requesting federal funding to purchase
12 full-sized hydrogen buses. We are concerned that the reduction in
manufacturers will mean it will take two years to receive those buses.
We welcome strategies to increase access to new manufacturers of bus
vehicles while they become ``Buy America'' eligible.
Both Island Transit and CTAA support the Federal Transit
Administration's recent prioritization of allowing agencies to make
progress payments to bus manufacturers, something that will help those
businesses with their cash-flow challenges. Also, in Washington State
we are fortunate to have a state department of transportation that has
contracts in place with many vendors, making joint procurements easier
for smaller transit agencies.
Challenge: Limitations of Current Technology
For small transit agencies like mine, fleet transitions like the
one we've embarked on will take time. The advances in zero emission
technology have not extended to all vehicle classes. The battery range
is low for smaller vehicles, making them a challenge for many rural
operators whose service areas cover hundreds, and sometimes thousands,
of square miles. For our new vehicles we were expecting a range of 200
miles, however our initial testing shows a much more limited range,
about 100 miles. For context, most of our vehicles travel 140 to 250
miles or more a day. Charging infrastructure is just not as prevalent
yet in rural America.
As agencies like Island Transit move to some electric vehicles,
concerns arise about the capacity of our local power grids. Grid
resiliency, including after storm damage, is especially important. Our
agency is working with our local power provider for a new transformer
that is needed for the charging of more electric vehicles. To address
this long-term concern, my agency was fortunate to buy acreage adjacent
to our operating base, with the hope we may site a micro grid there to
support our energy needs.
The national investment in hydrogen hubs will help transit agencies
like Island Transit who will use hydrogen for a portion of its fleet.
Additional investments in battery technology and the nation's power
grid will also benefit the transition to battery and hydrogen fuel cell
vehicles.
Challenge: Property Acquisition and Development
Just like their large urban counterparts, rural transit systems
need modern facilities. Island Transit is working with the Federal
Transit Administration to build a transit center at the south end of
our long island. We need a place there for safe, off-street transfers.
In the latest round of bus funding, the FTA awarded us $7.52 million
for this project. We thank Representative Larsen for that. Senator
Murray and Senator Cantwell secured us an additional $4 million in
Congressionally designated spending, in the FY 2024 appropriations
bill.
When building facilities, all transit agencies, unlike highway
projects, are required to complete the environmental process before
purchasing the property. If they do not complete that environmental
work first, they are not eligible for federal dollars to develop the
project. This makes land acquisition exceedingly challenging for many
transit agencies. Thankfully, this was not an issue for my agency, but
for others it is.
Challenge: Front-Line Employee Recruitment
Recruitment, as for most employers these days, is a significant
challenge for my transit agency. We have been able to cost-effectively
implement service increases, but we chronically lack drivers. We see
two places where the federal government could make changes that would
assist us in recruiting: one is to fast-track the certification of oral
testing labs for our required drug and alcohol testing. CTAA would like
to request that members of this committee send a letter to HHS urging
them to finish this important certification. Another area is the
requirements for a Commercial Driver's License. We need an addition to
the CDL passenger endorsement that is focused on bus driving and public
transit. Additionally, there needs to be a way to consider learning
disabilities and language differences in the testing.
Priorities
The Community Transportation Association of America is working to
address the vehicle shortage, particularly the small bus industry,
because those vehicles are the mainstay of most rural transit systems.
To that end, CTAA advocates for strategies to address that shortage,
including increasing access to new manufacturers while they locate
facilities in America and streamlining the vehicle procurement process.
Here are CTAA's 2024 Legislative and Policy Priorities
1.  Maintain full funding for FTA formula grant programs as
authorized in IIJA.

2.  Provide 80 percent federal share for all FTA formula grants,
regardless of whether these grants are providing operating or capital
assistance to public transit providers.

3.  Create a tier of supplemental Section 5311 funding to be
awarded on a STIC-like basis to states in which rural transit providers
exceed selected performance benchmarks.

4.  Assure that FTA recipients and subrecipients can retain all of
the proceeds from the sale or disposition of vehicles acquired with FTA
financial assistance when they commit to using these proceeds for
capital replacement.

5.  Set aside a percentage of Section 5339 bus and bus facility
grants, including Section 5339(c) low- and no-emission bus and bus
facility grants, for award to tribal nations' bus, bus facilities, and
``low/no'' projects.

6.  Make the Internal Revenue Code's charitable mileage rate for
volunteer drivers the same as the mileage rate for non-taxed
reimbursable business travel, and adjust the charitable mileage rate
annually, just like the business rate.

7.  Have FTA establish a public interest waiver from Buy America
for standard production vans and minivans, including vans and minivans
modified solely to become accessible to wheelchair-using passengers,
provided that the final assembly of these vans and minivans takes place
in the US, Canada or Mexico.

8.  Develop criteria for identifying particular states and urban
areas with exceptionally low numbers of CDL-holding drivers as
``transportation professional shortage areas,'' and give FTA authority
to consider waiving any or all provisions at 49 USC Section 5323 as
requested by FTA recipients in those areas.

9.  Require FTA to identify the scope of data collection and
reporting requirements currently placed upon its rural, tribal and
smaller urban transit recipients, and mandate that no additional data
collection or reporting requirements be placed on these transit
providers until or unless existing requirements are streamlined,
simplified or reduced.

10.  Have DOT and HHS take steps to accelerate the implementation
of saliva-based testing for marijuana among employers and employees
covered by federally required transportation workforce drug and alcohol
testing regulations.

11.  Call upon FTA to allow (and provide guidance concerning)
advance and progress-based payments for vehicle procurements likely to
take 13 months or more to fulfill, and establish mechanisms by which
FTA can allow the use of performance bonds to assure timely, cost-
compliant production and delivery of transit vehicles.

12.  Change DOT NEPA guidelines to allow FTA recipients to acquire
the real estate for bus-related facilities prior to beginning the
environmental assessment process.

13.  Provide technical assistance and financial incentives to
advance the deployment of charging infrastructure for electric medium-
and heavy-duty buses, trucks and heavy equipment where appropriate in
smaller communities and rural areas, particularly to enable
coordination and partnerships between local utilities, transit
agencies, local public works agencies and other fleet operators.

14.  Establish a program of FTA formula grants specifically for
tribal nations' transit projects on reservations and tribal lands in
urban areas with populations greater than 50,000.

The Bus Coalition has the following priorities:

Increasing funding ($400 million) for the Bus and Bus
Facility Program along with legislative language that would set aside a
portion ($150 million) for the FTA to address cost escalations for
previous grant awardees.

Support for CTAA's efforts to address the cutaway crisis.

Support microgrid and battery storage initiatives through
the Department of Energy and FTA

Seek additional spare ratio flexibility.

Address local match concerns, especially as transit
systems transition to more expensive zero emission vehicles.

I'd like to end by introducing you to one of Island Transit's bus
riders, James. James is a veteran turned veteran's advocate. Not only
does he use Island Transit, but he also sees it as linking the veteran
community to essential resources. He said: ``Island Transit gives
people like me, a Vet, a chance to get to where I need to go and help
others. Without Island Transit, I couldn't do what I do.''
Thank you for being our partner in providing the service that
benefits so many. Thank you for the opportunity to share about our
needs as we do this work.

Mr. Crawford. Thank you. I now recognize the gentleman from
South Dakota to introduce our final witness.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Mr. Chairman, on one hand, it
is sufficient to describe my friend, Scott, as a third-
generation producer from Volga. That's important and noble
work, so, it's a good description. But on the other hand, it
doesn't tell the whole story.
The reality is Scott is among the very most trusted policy
voices in South Dakota. And as I thought about why that is,
it's because so many people in politics, they are dramatic, and
they are hyperbolic, and their hair is always on fire. In
typical Farm Bureau fashion, though, Scott VanderWal is level,
steady, deliberate, and wise, and so, people in South Dakota
have figured out that when Scott VanderWal tells you something,
you can take it to the bank. And I am sure that will be the
experience of this committee, as well, today.
Thank you for being with us.
Mr. Crawford. I thank the gentleman from South Dakota.
And Mr. VanderWal, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF SCOTT VanderWal, NATIONAL VICE PRESIDENT, AMERICAN
FARM BUREAU FEDERATION

Mr. VanderWal. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of
the committee. Good morning. I am Scott VanderWal, a third-
generation corn and soybean farmer and cattle feeder from east
central South Dakota. I am president of the South Dakota Farm
Bureau and vice president of the American Farm Bureau
Federation. And I am pleased to offer this testimony today on
behalf of the American Farm Bureau Federation and the nearly 6
million Farm Bureau member families across these United States.
The long-term success of American agriculture relies upon a
robust, safe, and dependable transportation network. My
testimony today will outline several key issues affecting our
Nation's agriculture, industry, and transportation
infrastructure. During the past few years, farmers in South
Dakota have been under pressure from a variety of factors
outside of our control, such as the pandemic, three consecutive
years of drought, and the highly pathogenic avian influenza.
Farmers were more frustrated than anyone at the supply
chain delays we saw during the pandemic. We want the supply
chains straightened out as soon as possible so we can get goods
from our farms to America's pantries. That is why I am grateful
that Representative Johnson from South Dakota has introduced
the Modernizing Operations for Vehicles in Emergencies Act, or
the MOVE Act. This bill gives States more flexibility to waive
Federal weight limits in the Interstate Highway System in order
to allow the States to respond to emergencies. This will help
to resolve supply chain issues quickly and allow our food
system to be more adaptable.
The American Farm Bureau Federation continues to be
supportive of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or
IIJA, that made essential investments to our Nation's
infrastructure. These investments will continue to give farmers
and ranchers a leg up on competitors in the world market.
This last year, the U.S. became a net importer of food for
the first time in many of our lifetimes. So, new investments
are timely. This is a huge concern for us, as we work very hard
every day to make sure that the United States is not dependent
upon other countries for our food supply. Food security is a
huge part of national security, and we take that very, very
seriously.
Farmers and ranchers do not work remotely, but our products
reach markets well beyond our farm gates. Nearly everything we
do involves physical items, whether it's crop inputs, feed,
livestock, grains, or other produce that we grow. These all
have to be moved physically from or to markets around the world
or the United States. While highways play a vital role in
transporting goods across the country, we must also recognize
the importance of our rail and inland waterway infrastructure.
In most cases, transporting goods via waterways can be more
cost effective than traditional road transport.
The national Highway Trust Fund serves as the backbone of
our transportation infrastructure, providing crucial funding
for maintenance and improvement of our roads and bridges. Farm
Bureau supports increasing Federal Highway Trust Fund fees to
reflect improvements in fuel economy and increased inflation.
We also support revenue collection efforts to those users
whose vehicles do not contribute to the Federal Highway Fund,
such as electric vehicles. I am hopeful that this committee
will work with the American Farm Bureau Federation to
prioritize long-term, sustainable funding solutions for the
national Highway Trust Fund.
Electronic logging devices, or ELDs, play a crucial role in
ensuring the safety and efficiency of our Nation's
transportation system. However, certain exemptions of these
devices are necessary to accommodate the unique needs of the
agricultural community. We aren't hauling widgets that can sit
in a truck bed for 10 hours. We are hauling live animals, and
each stop along the way poses hazards to the livestock. The
IIJA provided an exemption for livestock and insect haulers
from hours-of-service regulations within a 150 air-mile radius
of their final destination. We are thankful that Congress
continues to recognize that need, and we ask for continued
support on that.
In conclusion, I urge this committee to consider the
perspectives and priorities of the agricultural community as
you work to address the challenges that face our Nation's
transportation infrastructure. By working together to
prioritize long-term investment, maintain necessary exemptions,
and promote biofuel production, we can ensure a brighter, more
sustainable future.
Thank you so much for the opportunity to testify before you
today, and I will look forward to your questions.
[Mr. VanderWal's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Scott VanderWal, National Vice President,
American Farm Bureau Federation
Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am Scott VanderWal, a
third generation corn and soybean farmer and cattle feeder from Volga,
South Dakota. I am President of the South Dakota Farm Bureau and vice
president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. I am pleased to offer
this testimony on behalf of the American Farm Bureau Federation and the
nearly 6 million Farm Bureau member families across this country.
The long-term success of American agriculture relies upon a robust,
safe and dependable transportation network. Farmers and ranchers need
to efficiently transport goods to market to ensure our nation's food
supply remains safe and secure. Access to well-maintained roads,
waterways, ports and railways is critical for business, and outdated
infrastructure in our rural communities poses a significant threat to
the security of our agricultural economy.
Rural communities play an important role in our nation's economy.
They are home to a majority of U.S. manufacturing, farming and
ranching. American agriculture provides the food and fiber for our
country and the world, creating jobs for millions of Americans.
Deteriorating rural infrastructure, however, threatens the competitive
leadership of American agriculture. Our farmers' and ranchers' ability
to meet domestic demands and compete globally depends on a robust and
reliable infrastructure.
My testimony today will outline several key issues affecting our
nation's agriculture industry and transportation infrastructure.
MOVE Act
During the past few years, farmers in South Dakota have been under
pressure from a variety of factors outside of our control, such as the
pandemic, three consecutive years of drought, and the Highly Pathogenic
Avian Influenza. Of course, negative headlines often find a way to
crowd out the positive, but research shows that Americans trust farmers
and ranchers, more than any other profession. They understand that we
are committed to growing safe, sustainable food, fiber and fuel, even
as we face mounting challenges beyond our control.
Farmers were more frustrated than anyone at the supply chain delays
we saw in the pandemic. We want the supply chains straightened out as
soon as possible so we can get goods from the farm to America's
pantries. The federal government needs to provide flexibility to states
when we are dealing with pandemics or disaster events. We all saw that
firsthand.
That's why I'm grateful that Representative Dusty Johnson (R-SD)
has introduced the Modernizing Operations for Vehicles in Emergencies
(MOVE) Act.
This bill gives states more flexibility to waive federal weight
limits on the interstate highway system in order to allow the states to
respond to emergencies. This will help resolve supply chain shortages
quickly and allow our food system to be more adaptable.
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)
The American Farm Bureau Federation continues to be supportive of
the IIJA that made essential investments to our nation's
infrastructure. These investments will continue to give farmers and
ranchers a leg up on competitors in the world market. This past year,
the U.S. became a net importer of food--for the first time in many of
our lifetimes--so new investments are timely.
Farmers and ranchers do not work remotely, but our products reach
markets well beyond our farm gates. Farm inputs and the products we
raise all have to be moved to markets across the world. Our competitive
advantage has always been an efficient transportation network.
While highways play a vital role in transporting goods across the
country, we must also recognize the importance of our rail and inland
waterway infrastructure. In most cases, transporting goods via
waterways can be more cost-effective than traditional road transport.
By improving and expanding our inland waterway infrastructure, we
can alleviate congestion on our roads and reduce the wear and tear on
our highways. Studies [https:/www.nationalwaterwaysfoundation.org/file/
28/tti%202022%20final%20report
%202001-2019%201.pdf] have shown barges can provide transportation at a
tenth of the cost of rail and a sixteenth of the cost of trucking when
available. This not only benefits the agricultural industry but also
contributes to overall economic efficiency and environmental
sustainability.
National Highway Trust Fund
The National Highway Trust Fund serves as the backbone of our
transportation infrastructure, providing crucial funding for the
maintenance and improvement of our roads and bridges.
However, the Trust Fund faces significant challenges, including
insufficient funding and outdated infrastructure. According to the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO), projections indicate a shortfall of
$149.7 billion over the five fiscal years following the expiration of
the IIJA.
Farm Bureau supports increasing Federal Highway Trust Fund fees to
reflect improvements in fuel economy and increased inflation. We also
support revenue collection efforts to those users whose vehicles do not
contribute to the Federal Highway Fund (electric vehicles).
I am hopeful that this committee will work with the American Farm
Bureau Federation to prioritize long-term, sustainable funding
solutions for the National Highway Trust Fund to ensure the continued
viability of our transportation infrastructure and make sure all those
who use our highways pay into the Trust Fund.
Electronic Logging Devices--Hours of Service Exemption
Electronic logging devices (ELDs) play a crucial role in ensuring
the safety and efficiency of our nation's transportation system.
However, certain exemptions of these devices are necessary to
accommodate the unique needs of the agricultural community. Farmers and
ranchers often operate on tight schedules dictated by weather
conditions, harvest cycles and market demands. Mandating ELD
regulations without providing necessary hours of service exemptions for
livestock would raise serious concerns about animal welfare.
We aren't hauling widgets that can sit in a truck bed for 10 hours.
We are hauling living animals and each stop along the way poses hazards
to the livestock. Farmers and ranchers need to ensure that their
livestock are healthy when they arrive at their destination. The IIJA
provided an exemption for livestock and insect haulers from Hours-of-
Service regulations within a 150 air-mile radius of their final
destination. We are thankful that Congress continues to recognize that
need and ask for continued support.
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA): National Performance Management
Measures; Assessing Performance of the National Highway System,
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Measure
Farmers and ranchers across the country are committed to providing
food to both domestic and global markets. We recognize the importance
of sustainable practices that minimize our environmental footprint and
believe that agriculture is well-positioned to help reduce emissions.
Renewable fuels offer a choice that can supplement fossil fuels,
helping to reduce our emissions while giving us a valuable market for
the crops we grow.
Congress should continue to invest in biofuel infrastructure and
promote the use of renewable fuels by passing year-round E15. The
Environmental Protection Agency could also help by providing larger
volume increases to advanced biofuels so that heavy-duty trucks can be
more involved in lowering emissions. These actions could be quick fixes
to reducing greenhouse gas emissions on roadways.
This past November, FHWA finalized a rule that imposes emissions
performance measures on state departments of transportation. This rule
will favor states with large populations that can build public transit
or buy electric buses. We do not support additional burdens placed on
states by the FHWA with respect to establishing declining carbon
dioxide targets and for states to then report on progress toward the
achievement of those targets.
South Dakota highway users--and all rural Americans--want to see
safe and reliable roads well into the future. Adding more bureaucracy
and red tape to the highway planning process will limit long-term
success and put rural Americans at a disadvantage. If the federal
government's goal is to lower emissions on the roadway, higher blends
of renewable fuels are proven policy solutions to help achieve national
climate goals.
Conclusion
In conclusion, I urge this committee to consider the perspectives
and priorities of the agricultural community as you work to address the
challenges facing our nation's transportation infrastructure. By
working together to prioritize long-term investment, maintain necessary
exemptions, and promote biofuel production, we can ensure a brighter
more sustainable future. Thank you for the opportunity to testify
before you today. I look forward to your questions.

Mr. Crawford. Thank you, sir. I thank all the witnesses for
being here today. Thank you for your testimony.
I now turn to Member questions. I recognize myself. I would
like to raise an issue that I have significant concerns with,
which is the Federal Highway Administration's final rule to
create a greenhouse gas performance measure forcing State
departments of transportation and metropolitan planning
organizations to set declining targets for carbon dioxide
emissions stemming from transportation on the National Highway
System.
This policy was considered and rejected as part of
negotiations of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
Despite that fact, the Biden administration continues to march
forward with their proposal. The full committee and this
subcommittee have previously heard concerns from other
stakeholders regarding this rule.
Specifically, folks have raised concerns about how this
rule will impact the ability of States to select their own
projects and what that would mean to rural communities. As I
mentioned in my opening statement, these are areas where a
subway system or bike lanes just simply don't make sense, and
they won't help move people or goods within or from our rural
areas. So, I would like to start with Mr. Greteman.
Do you share those concerns?
Mr. Greteman. Yes. Great question, Chairman, absolutely.
Because the greenhouse gas performance measures apply a
one-size-fits-all to both rural and urban communities, it just
doesn't make sense for certain communities to have bike lanes,
to have subways, to have heavy transit in rural Iowa, rural
Arkansas, western Nebraska. These places don't need that type
of service. And when you start influencing States, State
officials on how they can spend their revenue, it leads to--to
me, it just seems like a recipe for disaster.
And reducing greenhouse gas is important, but it needs to
be done in a fiscally sensible way. They will end up spending
money on projects that are not necessary and don't provide any
economic benefit. And no, I don't think it benefits rural
America at all.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you.
Mr. VanderWal, you addressed this in your written
testimony. Do you want to expand on that?
Mr. VanderWal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, we are very
concerned about that process because it does complicate the
process.
For a small State like South Dakota, we don't have the
resources in a lot of cases. And frankly, not the need for some
of these transportation methods. Like you mentioned, subways,
we don't have any subways in South Dakota. Electric vehicles is
another one that is a real challenge for us because it can be
25 degrees below zero in the wintertime. And as we saw with
Chicago during the cold snap this winter, they don't work well
in that circumstance.
So, we believe it's not fair to States that have fewer
resources, and we need flexibility among the States. Like the
previous speaker said, one size doesn't fit all.
Mr. Crawford. Got it. Mr. Greteman, in your testimony, you
discussed the importance of having one Federal standard for
companies engaged in interstate commerce as it relates to meal
and rest break provisions. Can you elaborate on that, and why
there is currently a patchwork of State provisions, and how
that's problematic?
Mr. Greteman. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
One aspect of our company's mission is maintaining
operational simplicity. And not only would this create
operational inefficiencies for our company, it creates
operational inefficiencies for every single company that
operates in interstate commerce. How would the DOT hours-of-
service rules apply? Which State regulations would supersede?
We have motorcoaches that depart Sioux Falls, South Dakota,
pick up a group in northwest Iowa. The driver from South Dakota
switches drivers in Illinois or Missouri by St. Louis, switch
to another driver. Which sets of rules would apply? We are
going to drive through six States. We are going to use drivers
from multiple States. We have an origin, we have a destination.
Which State rules will apply? Cross-country travel will be
completely disrupted. How will electronic logging devices
accommodate the different State changes?
Right now, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations,
they work. We have a uniform safety scheme that works great for
the United States travel, and having a patchwork of different
State provisions would just be an utter failure in progress of
moving goods, services, and people across the United States.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you. The Clean Freight Coalition just
this week announced the results of a study which found $1
trillion of investments could be required to meet goals set by
States and the Federal Government to reduce emissions from and
electrify the trucking sector.
Mr. VanderWal, our ag sector, like many others, relies on
trucking to deliver goods to market. American families are
dependent on those products. I have some concerns about forcing
a massive shift to EVs, and particularly as it applies to
trucks. A trucker hauling cattle across Arkansas doesn't have
the hours to spend waiting for their truck to charge. Your
thoughts on that? And in just a few seconds.
Mr. VanderWal. Yes, we would be concerned about that. We
feel that if the administration wants to reduce the carbon
footprint, we certainly have something to contribute through
biofuels and renewable fuels that we can contribute. You are
correct, we can't have livestock trucks sitting along the side
of the road, especially in hot conditions. So, it's very, very
much a concern for us.
Mr. Crawford. Thank you. I appreciate that.
Ranking Member Norton.
Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is a question for
Mr. Koles.
Can you share your concerns about the bill and the effects
that allowing heavier trucks would have on safety and
infrastructure, particularly on bridges?
Mr. Koles. We work closely with the Farm Bureau in our
State, and we are going to take just a little bit different
position than the Farm Bureau during this hearing.
So, NATaT is opposed to extra weights on the roads. From an
engineering aspect, it creates more damage, especially to
bridges. Bridges don't care about axles, it's all about weight.
And then, from a safety standpoint, for the few States that we
do have enough quality data from, the safety aspects are
problematic, as well, because the crash amounts increase. So,
we are very concerned about any increased weights beyond the
current standards that are there right now.
Ms. Norton. Thank you.
Mr. Morrow, your testimony notes that over 15 percent of
people in Island County have a disability. Transit is often a
lifeline for people with disabilities. Can you share any
strategies or success stories from Island Transit's work
serving those in your community with disabilities?
Mr. Morrow. Well, thank you very much, Ranking Member
Holmes Norton, I appreciate the question.
And yes, as you know, transit is critical to supporting
access to opportunities for all Americans, especially those who
are dependent on it, and that includes people with
disabilities.
And one of the things that we have done in order to make
more access to opportunities available is increase our service
and add service. As you heard, we added Sunday service for the
first time in our history, which means that now people who are
transit-dependent, are with disabilities and use us, can now
access and do whatever they want on Sundays where our service
goes.
And one really interesting story about that was a gentleman
named Lucas, one of our bus riders, a wonderful young man who
was obviously thrilled that we would add Sunday service because
it opened up opportunities for him. He organizes his life
around our bus service so that he can see his friends, and go
to work, and do all those things. When he met me the first week
after I was at Island Transit, he saw me standing at the bus
stop looking like I am today, and I think he was pretty
suspicious. Who is this guy getting on there? And he knew right
away I was the new executive director, and he treated me like
the President of the United States, because what Island Transit
does for him on a daily basis so very much improves his life.
Thank you.
Ms. Norton. Mr. Morrow, what can Congress do to help ensure
transit agencies can purchase the vehicles they need?
Mr. Morrow. Well, thank you for that question. You are
already doing it with the investments. For instance, the strong
and increased investments in the bus and bus facilities program
has made a substantial difference.
Obviously, a bus operator like myself will say there is
always room to do more. I think you all know that there was
maybe $8 billion in requests in the last round for bus and bus
facilities funding, and available was about $1.7 billion,
something like that. My agency benefited from that, and I thank
Ranking Member Larsen for that, for the FTA grant that we
received.
But also, supporting things like the progress payments that
the FTA is working on that will help manufacturers so that they
can receive payment for the vehicles as they are produced, that
will help them.
Investing in technology. One of the real challenges in the
rural transit industry for us in the CTAA world is that not all
of those improvements have made it to the small bus market yet.
And so, we really need to see longer battery ranges, other
options in the small vehicle market.
And then, as I mentioned before--and this is, I know,
something that some of you are working on--is an on-ramp for
the manufacturers who are in the process of coming to the
United States, who have good vehicles that we could use today.
We need somehow to have access to those vehicles while they are
working through the Buy America process.
It's all those sorts of things in combination, and then
also remember it's different depending on whether it's small
vehicles and large vehicles. There is no one-size-fits-all
response. Thank you.
Ms. Norton. And I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentlelady yields. The gentleman from
South Dakota, Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. VanderWal, ag shippers have dealt with a lot in recent
years: high path, drought, COVID. Talk to us about the
difficulties they have faced when dealing with those challenges
and the emergency truck weight waivers.
Mr. VanderWal. Well, thank you, Representative, for that
question. That is a big deal for South Dakota and, frankly,
most of the States.
And I guess I would use an example of the Texas drought
about 3 years ago. South Dakota was having a good year. We had
lots of hay, and we had lots of ranchers wanting to donate hay
to the ranchers in Texas. And logistically, it got to be a
problem because they had to get exemptions from Governors
across all the States, all the way from South Dakota to Texas,
and that got to be quite a process.
But what the situation is, is you want to do something like
that as economically, inexpensively as you can. And when you
have people donating hay, and in some cases, we had people
donating their--at least some of the truck-miles, the trip
permits and all the things that go along with going through
those States and the different regulations get to be a problem.
So, our members put in policy a request to streamline the
process to make that happen more economically.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Yes, and you could just
imagine all kinds of scenarios, emergency scenarios, where some
additional flexibility and streamlining that flexibility could
be useful. Give us some other ideas, examples of where ag
shippers or, really, the ag industry generally would want a
little more flexibility.
Mr. VanderWal. Well, I would start out by answering that by
saying the livestock can't wait for feed in disaster
situations. We have had it in South Dakota, too: floods,
snowstorms, all kinds of things. We have had several cases in
the past where the Governor has waived the height and weight
limits for trucks hauling hay certain times of the day or
extended the hours. Those are all times when livestock in
particular need taken care of, and they can't wait, like I
said.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. So, as we look to--and there
is a 150-mile exemption for ag truckdrivers that they can get
around the hours of service, or the hours of service don't
apply to them. In general, is that working pretty well? Are
there any reforms needed to the system?
Mr. VanderWal. Yes, it certainly has helped, because it
gives them some flexibility. And flexibility is what we really
need. When we talk about this whole situation, that is really
the key.
And I will use an example of trucks that go out to western
South Dakota or Montana to pick up feeder cattle. A lot of
times they have to go out in the pastures, and the rancher will
often have them rounded up in the corrals, and sometimes they
don't. So, the trucker can arrive, and it might take 20 minutes
to load the load, or it could take 2 hours. And at that point,
they might know that they are going to be out of hours before
they get where they are going.
And a concern that we would have there is if that happens,
a rancher may not be able to sell his cattle that have to go
that far away. And maybe that's the best bidder for his cattle,
but he could be prevented from selling for the best price in
that circumstance.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. Yes, not everybody might
understand how much more difficult cattle can be to wrangle
than a pallet of iPhones. They have their own minds, and they
don't always take orders very well, as you know better than I
do.
Let's talk a little bit about the global supply chain and
shipping. During COVID, the west coast ports were pretty locked
up for quite a little while. That had a pretty big impact on
beans, which I know, along with corn and cattle, you produce.
And then also with the Red Sea. I mean, is Farm Bureau
concerned about--and have we seen much disruption, particularly
among the corn and bean folks, because of the Red Sea issue?
Mr. VanderWal. Yes, we have seen some disruptions. And,
obviously, we are in a worldwide economy when it comes to corn
and beans and a lot of these commodities. And it affects the
markets because the markets get jittery about certain things
like that. They don't like uncertainty, they don't like
disruptions.
And whether or not the products that we raise in South
Dakota are going someplace where they have to go through the
Black Sea, that doesn't really matter. But it's the disruptions
in the market. And so, we try to look for other markets or
expanded markets around the world, but at this point, we
haven't been able to do that, either. So, it is a problem, and
we are concerned about it going forward.
Mr. Johnson of South Dakota. So, Mr. Chairman, I would
close by just trying to underline a couple of things that Mr.
VanderWal talked about, the things that we can take back into
our work.
Number one, some additional flexibility for America's
growers. I mean, our farmers and ranchers, they will do better
if they have the flexibility they need to get these products,
get this food to market.
And then also the importance of developing new markets
abroad. In America, we ship out a heck of a lot of corn, beans,
beef, vegetables, dairy, and other things. People are hungry
for our food. Let's make it easier for them to get it.
With that, I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Ranking Member Larsen.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Morrow, Todd, thanks for coming and helping us out on
short notice. I appreciate that. And I wanted to give you an
opportunity to talk a little bit about Island County or Island
Transit service. I think it might have been kind of glossed
over quickly. Island Transit, by virtue of its name, it's an
island. In fact, it's two islands, not just one island. It's
two separate islands unconnected by a bridge. You have to go
around into other counties to get to the other island.
So, you have some unique challenges, but you are trying to
update service, expand service, extend hours. And of course,
you moved to Sunday. From a rural transit perspective, what
were the challenges and what are the challenges you are facing
doing that?
Mr. Morrow. Yes, thank you very much, Congressman.
One of the main challenges right now--and I think it exists
in pretty much every industry, of course--is having the
workforce available to do the things that are needed. In our
case, we just started another class of driver trainees. That's
great, but we still need more. And in order to complete our
transition that you alluded to, to what we call Island Transit
Maximized, to expand service, to really meet all the needs
throughout the day, we need to add a couple of hours to the end
of the day. And that's the last thing that we need to do, and
it's going to take us probably about 7 to 10 more drivers in
order to do that. So, it's going to be several months off. We
had hoped to do it last year. So, that is always challenging.
Operating costs are definitely always higher in rural
environments, and that's something that all of us that provide
transit across America in particularly rural situations know.
But just because we are in a rural environment doesn't mean
that those people deserve any less the services that all
Americans enjoy.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. So, on extending hours to the end
of the day, why is that so important?
Mr. Morrow. Well, we have essential workers, for instance,
that rely on transit because their transportation costs are so
high. Transit allows them to save money. And these are the
people that work, for instance, at Walmart, one of our busiest
commercial entities on the island that serves the people that
are there. Their hours are until 11 o'clock at night, and so,
those workers that work those shifts are not currently able to
use us because we don't have those hours. That is what our goal
is to add those hours so that we can support those workers.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. And then do you have specific
service? You mentioned Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, which
is the, I should note, home of half of the P-8 fleet and all of
the Growler fleet, the electronic attack aircraft. So, you are
welcome, America. Do you have any specific service for NAS
Whidbey Island?
Mr. Morrow. Yes, thank you for asking. We actually have on-
demand direct service, where individuals who are properly
credentialed, including servicemen and servicewomen, as well as
civilians that are there, we take them from their neighborhoods
directly on base. And the wonderful thing about it is it avoids
the congestion at the gate and leading up to the gate, and it
saves them money. Many of them are a single-car household, and
so, this frees up the car to be used by the spouse that's not
working there.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. You mentioned a challenge, or
maybe you didn't see it as a challenge, but the service you
provide for folks who are disabled or homebound or otherwise--
about 13 percent of your ridership.
Mr. Morrow. Correct.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Is that right?
Mr. Morrow. Yes, exactly, yes. Thirteen percent of our
service is paratransit service. Obviously, that's expensive
because you are providing a door-to-door service. So, what we
try to do is batch together as many trips as possible. There is
software that we use. This is something rural transportation
providers have been doing forever, is figuring out ways to
efficiently transport people where they need to go. But it is
more expensive. We have combined it now with our on-demand
service in other areas, so that we can do all of those things
together more efficiently.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. How does that compare to, say,
your neighboring transit agencies?
Mr. Morrow. Well, on-demand service is something that is
starting to be seen more and more across the country. We have
just started it. There are some that still do not have it.
And then, if you are getting to the point of how do we
connect up with other systems, we have arrangements and we do
connect both our paratransit and our fixed-route scheduled
service so that people can make those connections.
However, if you are a veteran and you need to go and--to
Veteran Affairs or medical services, that can be harder in a
rural area like ours, because there are no direct bus routes
off the island to take people. So, there are actually social
service agencies that provide that service with our help. We
provide them the van, the training, we maintain that van so
they can do that.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you. Thanks very much.
Thanks for making the trip out, and hopefully we will see you
at home.
Mr. Morrow. Thank you.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Mr. Mann.
Mr. Mann. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Chairman, thanks
for having this hearing to really zone in on the needs of our
rural communities.
So, I represent the First Congressional District of Kansas,
which is 60 counties in the mostly central and western part of
the State. I am from a rural community. My hometown, 800
people. My driver's ed coach was also my basketball coach,
which, if you are from a rural community, you understand that.
And he used to load us up when we would drive 60 miles to the
big city of Hays--because there are stoplights in Hays, and
there is no stoplight in our county--as we were learning how to
drive.
Our family has a farm and a feed yard, and I remember--that
my dad and brother still operate--middle of the night, a cattle
truck rolls in, you unload them, those cattle may have been on
the road from Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Florida. Incredibly
important. And repeatedly, the driver's number-one priority was
safety and also caring for those animals. And then they would
put their own needs last, because that's just the makeup of
that industry.
And Mr. VanderWal, I have a handful of questions for you.
And this continues to come up, this hours-of-service exemption.
And it keeps coming up this morning because it is so incredibly
important to the industry. So, would you just further expand
upon the importance of the exemption, but also possible
ramifications, or what are the effects if we do not continue
this exemption in the future?
Mr. VanderWal. Well, thank you for that question.
It all comes down to flexibility, again, like I said
before. I will use the example of loading cattle in Montana.
That can vary by a couple of hours. And it's so important,
especially in hot times when you are hauling livestock, you
have to keep moving to make sure that the air moves through the
trailer to keep livestock cool. And they can't just be sitting
along the edge of the road.
So, like I said earlier, that may limit a person's ability
to sell where he wants to sell, or it could just be a situation
where we are not treating the livestock right, and that's not
what we are after at all. First is safety of the people driving
the truck and the vehicles around it, but also animal welfare.
Mr. Mann. That's exactly right. What could Congress do to
improve upon the exemption?
And should we consider codifying it or making it permanent?
We forget, you know, we have to make an exemption every
year. I would be for just making this flexibility permanent,
but what are your thoughts on that issue?
Mr. VanderWal. Well, first of all, we very much appreciate
the exemption, because it has solved some problems and given us
flexibility. But it would be nice to have it permanent, because
we always have to have our antennas up to make sure we are out
there advocating to get that renewed again.
Mr. Mann. Yes, and it just provides more uncertainty to an
industry that is plagued with uncertainty given market
conditions and all the travails of trying to raise and care
for, feed, and eventually produce livestock to produce meat.
Last question. How can Congress ensure that our rural
infrastructure is prioritized at a time when it seems like many
times the administration overlooks rural America? In your view,
Mr. VanderWal, what is the administration and what ought we be
doing to focus more on the rural communities all across our
country, from a transportation standpoint?
Mr. VanderWal. Well, that's a great question, and I think
it really comes down to recognizing the importance of rural
America in producing our food for our country and for the
world, and also energy and fiber.
I always say when I give a speech: food security is
national security. As long as we can feed ourselves, no matter
what happens around the world, we'll be OK. But if we get to
the point where we have to depend on other countries for our
food supply, that's a serious problem.
Mr. Mann. I wholeheartedly agree. Mr. Chairman, thank you
again for having this hearing, thank you all for being here.
And I yield back the balance of my time.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Mrs. Foushee.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the
witnesses for your testimonies.
In my district, North Carolina's Fourth Congressional
District, the Research Triangle Park is growing, thanks to
investments in rural class research centers and businesses big
and small. But as it grows, the lack of affordable housing has
pushed those who work in the Triangle to move farther and
farther out into the more rural areas. That's why it has become
more important for regional transportation to reach rural areas
like those in Granville, Person, and Orange Counties, for
example.
Mr. Morrow, how can we better mitigate traffic on the major
local roadways to ease access for those who commute long
distances daily?
Mr. Morrow. Thank you very much for that question.
Invest more in transit because, as Island Transit does, we
have services that run from one of our islands into another
county just for that exact reason. Every time you have more
transit, more people can use it, and that takes cars off those
roads.
And in many cases, those commutes are pretty awful, I am
imagining, in your district, and it is a far better way to ride
comfortably in a bus, and not have to worry about that
congestion.
And you are benefiting all the other users of that highway,
as well, because you are actually increasing the carrying
capacity of those roadways without spending millions of dollars
to add more lanes by instead putting people who choose to on
buses.
So, it's a win-win for everybody. We have a great
relationship with our State department of transportation in
Washington State. They very much support the work of transit
because they know, the more that people use transit, it
increases the capacity of those facilities and lessens the
burden on them to expand and increase them at even higher
rates.
Thank you for the question.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you. I also have a concern about the
difficulties that small, rural municipalities face in applying
for grant funding, like a lack of time, staff, and experience.
What resources or educational systems could a congressional
office provide to these municipalities to better equip them to
apply and compete for funding with larger cities?
And this question goes to both Mr. Morrow and Mr. Koles.
Mr. Morrow [to Mr. Koles]. Want to go first?
Mr. Koles. The challenge for local, small communities is
real. You are having a community of a couple of hundred people,
a couple of thousand people that don't have the staff or the
financial resources to hire out for grant writers, and they are
competing with, in some of these grants, communities that are
hundreds of thousands of people. So, it's really a David and
Goliath situation.
From a strategy standpoint, what could we do in a
congressional office? Yes, I think it is about education, but
some of these grants are so complex to write that education of
some of our local officials--who are salt of the Earth people
but they just don't operate in that arena--might work in some
cases, but more likely the better strategy is to actually
provide some funding to hire grant writers so that those folks
that do not have the resources to even buy a ticket to the
ballpark can get a ticket to the ballpark.
Absent doing that, with these grants--and we have moved to
a very grant-oriented system--you are just going to leave them
out, leave them out of the option to apply and obtain those
grants.
Mr. Morrow. So, I was just going to add ditto, but also
funding the various national programs that help create the
capacity for people to learn how to write those grants. CTAA,
for instance, has an annual conference where people can come
and learn how to do that.
But probably the most important thing that you and your
office can directly do is just let the agencies know when these
grant opportunities come, and that will really help them. In
our case, at my agency, our grant writer also serves as the
clerk of the board and my assistant. So, we all wear lots of
hats. And so, any help that you and your staff can provide is
always greatly wanted. Thank you.
Mrs. Foushee. Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentlelady yields. Mr. Kean.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank
you to our witnesses for being here today.
Mr. Greteman, as you know, New York City is in the process
of finalizing details related to the Central Business District
Tolling Program, a first-of-its-kind, incredibly destructive
congestion pricing scheme that unfairly hurts New Jerseyans.
Under the plan, this program will impose significant tolling
costs on daily commuters and charge between $24 and $36 per bus
to companies that regularly bring visitors into the city. This
will most surely include charter bus routes for school field
trips into New York City.
Each year, hundreds of school field trips from my district
in New Jersey travel to the city to visit the various museums
and landmarks. How do you think this congestion pricing plan
will impact the price of a school field trip, and how will it
affect ABA members operating these routes?
Mr. Greteman. Yes, thank you for the question, Mr. Kean.
It is--when you think about the origin of the congestion
pricing, it is to reduce congestion in the central business
district. And whether that congestion is reduced by a private
motorcoach, a private bus, or a publicly funded city bus, a
Government-contracted commuter bus, the bus is inherently
reducing congestion, whether it's private or public. The fact
that private buses are having to pay the tax and public buses
are not doesn't make sense.
At the end of the day, it's not necessarily about reducing
congestion, it feels more like a tax. And it does affect the
school kids that are going to New York City to sightsee and
spend money. It does affect the seniors that are going to see a
play and spend money at a restaurant. And at the end of the
day, to me, to the ABA, it appears more like it is just another
tax that is only being applied to private operators, whether
you are riding in a privately owned bus or a Government-owned
bus.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. OK. Mr. Greteman, I also understand
that the MTA has announced plans to exempt personal vehicles of
people who have disabilities from the congestion pricing
scheme, as well as city-run paratransit vehicles, which is
commendable. Given the role and capabilities of your members'
buses, how could this impact people who have disabilities from
areas like my district who might want to visit New York, but
may not want or be able to drive?
Mr. Greteman. Yes, I believe that it will positively affect
these people. There is no reason why a private operator won't
be able to transport someone with disabilities. Most of the
private motorcoaches are equipped with ADA lifts which will
accommodate that.
But at the end of the day, it still boils down to why are
certain exemptions out there for private versus Government
buses?
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. So, the cost will go up.
Mr. Greteman. The cost will go up, the cost will go up for
the riders, the cost will go up for the bus companies. And
again, it is just another tax that--it is not necessarily about
reducing congestion, it seems to be a tax.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. And then, on a different issue, you
have referenced in your testimony the difficulties the
intercity bus operators have in accessing train stations and
other local transit centers to drop off or pick up passengers.
Can you expand on how these problems affect ABA members, and
specifically, their passengers?
Mr. Greteman. Yes, absolutely. So, when a private operator
is not allowed to use a publicly funded transit center for
pickups and dropoffs, it creates a bottleneck in the national
transportation system, as far as making meaningful connections
for passengers. A lot of times, people that are riding
intercity buses may not have the means to connect to the
intercity bus carrier without going through a transit, without
riding the bus, without riding a city bus to get to the
intercity bus.
If the intercity bus station in some scenarios is in a
nondesirable or it's in an industrial area where there is poor
access, it makes riding intercity buses less attractive and
less convenient. And what it ends up doing is not allowing
certain members of the traveling public to be able to get to
the bus station to get to where they need to go.
Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for
holding this hearing, and thank you to the witnesses for your
testimony today.
I filed some legislation back in January, the Stronger
Communities Through Better Transit Act. It has 104 cosponsors.
And what it would do would be to create a grant program, $80
billion over 4 years, $20 billion a year, to support
operational costs, as opposed to capital costs, for transit in
underserved and unserved urban and rural communities.
And with respect to rural communities, it would increase
the Federal share for operating cost to 80 percent, which would
be something very important, to extend transit to rural
communities, rural people living in rural communities.
Is that legislation something that you gentlemen can
support?
Mr. Morrow. Well, Todd Morrow from Island Transit, we are
part of our broader organization, CTAA, who can give you more
information about that, of course. But what I can tell you from
our agency perspective, investment in transit is good and
important, so, thank you for that.
I can also say that, when it comes to operational funding,
it's critical that we know that that operational funding will
continue. So, it can't be a time-limited bill, because if
that's the case, it's hard for a transit provider, whether for-
profit or nonprofit, or a governmental agency, to plan. If you
provide service and then the money runs out, you have to cut
the service. And there's nothing more horrible in our world
than having to reduce service.
So, for us, we would always want something to have the
promise of continued payment. We welcome any investment, thank
you.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you.
Mr. Greteman. Yes, yes, Mr. Johnson. Would private
operators, private transit operators be eligible for these
grants?
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Well, I would think that contracts
with public agencies to provide transit to underserved areas
would be covered. I would have to go back and check it. If it's
not, it should be.
Mr. Greteman. Absolutely, I agree. And it would be great.
And I think that 80 percent level is an appropriate amount and
would be great for both private and public entities.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Yes, it doesn't take a great big
bus to go into a small city or small community and pick up two
or three people. It can be a van, ideally. Or it could even be
some other vehicle, but just a way of getting people in rural
areas to the pharmacy, to the doctor's office, to school, to
the community college, or to visit a sick relative. Those
things are important to people who live in urban areas and
people who live in rural areas.
Mr. Koles, do you have anything to say about it, and Mr.
VanderWal?
Mr. VanderWal. Well, thank you. I apologize, I don't know
the details of the bill. But from a general standpoint, when
there is a need in a rural community, which all of South Dakota
is, it's usually appreciated.
Having said that, we always have to watch out for what the
strings that might be attached are. So, I am not sure what our
policy would be on that, so, I will have to leave it with that.
But thank you.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. And no strings attached that I know
of, just really offering service to unserved and underserved
areas, both urban, suburban, and rural.
Mr. Koles.
Mr. Koles. In our rural areas in our State, we use shared-
ride taxi as our focus for rural transit. So, if those rural
taxis could be supported in a way that increases the percent so
that they are more viable operations and create more access,
certainly that would be a good thing.
Mr. Johnson of Georgia. So, well, thank you all for your
thoughts about it.
This is an idea whose time has come, but unfortunately
mired in gridlock. We have 104 cosponsors, but all of them are
Democrats. But we need to work hard to try to make this
bipartisan legislation.
And to your point, Mr. Morrow, this is an issue that is not
going to be served in 4 years. We won't cure the problem or the
challenge. This is a challenge that we will continue to have,
and I appreciate that viewpoint.
Thank you, and I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
Mr. Van Orden.
Mr. Van Orden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Koles, in your written testimony, you mentioned that
approximately 19 percent of the population lives in rural
areas, but about 68 percent of the Nation's roads are in those
areas. You mentioned the critical structural failure of our
culvert in Farmington, which is being--the construction starts
in August on that.
About how many of these culverts--I know you can't pin it
across the country. Do you have an idea of how many of these
culverts, which is essentially a bridge less than 20 feet,
there are in the State of Wisconsin?
Mr. Koles. The national number is not known, and we are--
because we don't know exactly where they are, you are doing
estimates based on waterways and surveys. And there have been
three estimates, one by our association, one by the Wisconsin
County Highway Association, and one by the Wisconsin DOT, and
everybody comes to a number right in that 20,000 to 25,000
range.
So--and that's not culverts. That's from 6 feet to 20 feet.
There would be a vastly higher number for anything under 6
feet, as well.
Mr. Van Orden. OK. It's going to cost about $400,000 to fix
that culvert. That's a lot of money when you are talking about
Farmington. People don't understand. They are responsible for
maintaining all of their roads, and to apply, essentially, what
is it, 4 years' worth of their budget, about, to fix a single
culvert. I am just not OK with that.
In your testimony also, you mentioned that our rural
communities, the definition is 200,000 for rural. Well, Eau
Claire has got 69,737 people in it. That's the largest city in
our district. La Crosse has got 51,380 people in it. And if you
tell someone from Potosi in Grant County--it's a population of
647, and the second oldest brewery in the State of Wisconsin,
by the way--or Richland Center, that has got 5,114 people, or
people from Adams-Friendship that have--the village has got 639
people in there, you tell them that Eau Claire and La Crosse
are rural, they are going to laugh you out of a cornfield.
So, I really appreciate the fact that Mr. Stauber, my great
friend from Minnesota, who is sitting behind me, and Mr.
Finstad, also a Member--well, he is from Minnesota, but he is
still a good guy, don't hold that against him--I am very proud
that we introduced the Protecting Infrastructure Investments
for Rural America Act. And that is going to lower that
threshold to 20,000 folks for the definition of rural in
relationship to these roads.
Can you tell us what type of effect it would have, do you
think, nationwide, being the former chairman of the National
Association of Towns and Townships, and now Wisconsin Towns
Association--what effect would that have?
Mr. Koles. We appreciate all the folks that are on that
bill, appreciate your sponsoring that, as well as Mr.
Stauber's.
The definition of 200,000, as you noted, it's not rural,
and we have a Rural Surface Transportation Program now that has
$2 billion allocated into it out of the IIJA. And you have
communities of 200,000 that are competing with the smallest
town in Wisconsin. If they had the resources to muster a grant
application--they have 36 people.
Mr. Van Orden. Right.
Mr. Koles. Those towns often have one person in charge of
roads. In our State, 50 miles of road is the average roadway,
so, they are plowing all the roads, they are mowing 100 miles
of roads, because you have got to mow the ditches on both
sides. They are doing all the summer maintenance, and they just
don't have the time or the expertise to write a grant
application.
Contrast that with even the city of Eau Claire. They have a
public works director, an entire public works department, an
engineer, and perhaps even have a grant writer. And if they
don't, they have the resources to hire it out.
By decreasing that to something that is really, truly
rural, you are going to even the playing field so you don't
have that David and Goliath situation, and really open up the
opportunities for smaller communities to access those grants.
Mr. Van Orden. Thank you for that. I have limited time, but
I have got to tell you what, man. I wanted to have a grant
writer on my staff, and the House Ethics Committee said I could
and then I will be in jail in 5 minutes after that. So, we
don't have a grant writer on our staff, but we do have a guy
named John Spiros who is responsible for talking to guys like
you, and getting these community-directed programs going. We
can point you in the right direction, we just can't write it
for you, and here is why. Washington, DC, sends money to
Madison, Madison sends money to Madison and to Milwaukee, and
they forget about us. And we are not doing that anymore.
So, if you can get the word out again to all your folks,
get your community-directed spending projects to my office
ASAP, we are going to help shape those to make sure that we can
get money directly to the small communities that require these
funds because they can't afford it themselves. Because, as we
said, the vast majority of roads in the United States of
America run through small towns and middle America, and we are
feeding the world. So, please, when you get done with this
committee, let's go talk and make sure that you are on board.
Thank you.
Mr. Koles. I appreciate that.
Mr. Van Orden. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Ms. Hoyle.
I am sorry--Mr. Stanton. You got in here just in time.
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman; thank you
for the witnesses for joining us today.
Transportation networks, they are essential for the
movement of people and goods across my home State of Arizona.
Many of the rural routes across Arizona are interconnected with
interstate highways. And when an accident occurs on one of
those interstates, these rural routes become the alternative
route for traffic.
Rural reliever routes need to be adequately maintained and
serviced to handle the surge of traffic volume intended for
multilane interstates, even for short periods of time. Moving
traffic onto a reliever route instead of it sitting idle in
extended traffic is important not only to the frustrated
commuter and for the flow of goods from rural and urban areas,
but also for safety.
State Route 347 in Arizona is a four-lane, nondivided rural
highway with no street lights and only stop signs at
interchanges. This is just one example of rural roads across
Arizona, and particularly on the Navajo Nation in Arizona, that
I have visited and I have driven on that struggle to maintain a
level of service that we could expect from other areas of the
State.
Mr. Koles, in your testimony, you talk about low-cost,
commonsense safety measures like rumble strips that would be a
game-changer for rural and Tribal communities. How can Congress
be a better partner and work with our local and Tribal
communities to implement these types of safety measures?
Mr. Koles. Thank you for the question. Yes, there are, as I
said, rural roads. The ones you described are a lot more
dangerous, and there are a number of low-cost safety
mechanisms.
You mentioned the undivided highway. Dividing that, even
with barriers down the middle, eliminates those head-on
collisions. That is one of the potential strategies.
Another strategy, the rumble strips. In the rural areas, we
travel a lot longer distances. So, there is a tendency to be
distracted, a little sleepy. Rumble strips have been shown to
wake you up when you hit them, get that attention going again.
How can you be helpful? I think in two ways. First of all,
you have got to have the funding to do it. And I think we have
increased funding in IIJA and the FAST Act to try to address
some of these things. The key is to get it down to the local
level. That's the challenge, is we haven't designed the Federal
system to think about the capillaries, as I called them. We
have really developed the Federal system to look at only the
heart.
But we can't have--well, it's not something I would hope we
would allow for, to have this high safety concern, high death
rate. And instead, we would start to get some of that money
down to those local levels.
Mr. Stanton. I really appreciate that. You also mentioned
in your testimony rural roads are often Tribal roads, and these
roads must be maintained, must be maintained much better than
we have in Arizona and across the United States of America.
In Arizona, we are in the middle of a historic drought that
is impacting many of the rural roads that run through our
Tribal communities. Many of these rural roads are dirt, so, the
drought can create sand dunes. When we finally do get rain, the
water creates clay that acts like ice. This mud can trap
vehicles, delaying travel and keeping families from attending
work, school, doctor's appointments, et cetera.
While rain can seem to be a minor inconvenience to those in
urban areas, on rural Tribal roads, it can mean the difference
between getting somewhere or being stuck at home. I have heard
from one county that says that sometimes when mud is
particularly bad, the only option is to try and place
tumbleweeds under the tires to attempt to gain some traction.
Our Tribes and Tribal governments are equal nation-to-
nation partners. I know much of this maintenance falls on the
Department of the Interior under the Committee on Natural
Resources, but I would ask my colleagues here today and the
stakeholders on the stand to consider the needs of our Tribal
partners as we make important decisions on the local, State,
and Federal level. Our Tribes deserve safe roads that their
families can enjoy, and roads that can safely transport goods
across our State.
I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Mr. Stauber.
Mr. Stauber. Thank you, Chair Crawford, for holding this
really important meeting, and to all of our witnesses who have
really talked about what is really the heart of the issue, is
the rural communities and the rural voice in Washington, DC.
I want to commend my good friend, Representative Van Orden.
He and Representative Tiffany, we work closely on these issues
because we represent rural--I represent northeastern Minnesota,
rural Minnesota. Rural Wisconsin, rural Minnesota, it's the
same group of great people, same struggles, OK?
I just--I am going to kind of--I am not going to follow my
notes, because this--I am passionate about this. That IIJA, Mr.
Koles, that you talked about, 200,000 people or less? In
Minnesota, it's just Saint Paul and Minneapolis. So, that means
our small communities in northeastern Minnesota have to fight:
Edina, Bloomington, Wayzata, Roseville and such. It's the same
in Wisconsin. And we have talked about that.
My mother was born in Glidden, Wisconsin, in the town of
Jacobs, Ashland County. How is Glidden, Wisconsin, and Ashland
County, the town of Jacobs, supposed to fight with Milwaukee or
Madison? It is not fair. That bridge over the Chippewa River in
Glidden, when it needs to be fixed, it should be fixed because
those people in small-town America deserve the respect and the
appreciation of this town.
And it's on both sides of the aisle. My rural colleagues on
the Democratic side and my rural colleagues on the Republican
side, we get it, and we are pushing in one voice to make it
happen.
Mr. Koles, you bring up the--talk about grants. You are
exactly right. We have legislation to reduce the grant from 500
pages to 20 for our rural communities.
Mr. VanderWal, I agree with you, sometimes people aren't
taking these grants because there are so many strings attached
by this town. They have no idea. They have no idea your
struggles, and your needs and wants, your desires, and what
works in your community.
And I think that, in a healthy balance, my colleagues, my
rural Representatives on both sides of the aisle, we hear you
and we are working to change this now. It didn't get this way
overnight, and I don't think it is going to go back to where we
need. But I can tell you that the rural Members that spoke
today are one and the same on this issue.
I mean, had the IIJA--I am the only Federal Representative
on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for the
State of Minnesota. I had zero input on that. They just came
and said, ``Here it is.'' You can bet, had we had a look on
that, we would have found that 200,000 or less. It would have
been changed.
Representative Finstad and I, along with Representatives
Van Orden and Tiffany, we are signed on to that legislation to
bring it down to 20,000, something reasonable, because rural
America, as my good friend in Arizona, Mr. Stanton, just
mentioned, it matters. It matters. And we have to look beyond,
because I think the foundation of this country is the
heartland, is our rural communities. We have to have a fair
shot. We have to make it work with the folks you have in place.
Mr. Koles, I served in small-town government and county
commission. So, we are in the wheelhouse together on this. I
hear what you are saying. When you have to have--literally,
some of these major urban areas, they have the money to hire
several grant writers. That's not right, because the rural
America is neglected.
So, in my last 45 seconds here I just want to share--I just
want to thank you all for your comments and spending your time
and money coming here to help educate all of us and those
Members that represent the more urban areas, to let them know
of our concern. Everything that you talked about in regards to
rural transportation and a rural America has hit home. You have
hit a home run today. And so, this legislation and some of the
changes that we need to do, you can bet we are going to fight
with every fiber in our body because we represent our
constituents, our rural Minnesota and rural Wisconsin.
And I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Mr. Carbajal.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Mr. VanderWal, trucking is a critical mode of
transportation for rural America. Heavy trucks carry 70 percent
of the agricultural and food products in the United States. And
we also know that these heavy truck trips begin and end on
local, rural roads and bridges that don't receive direct
Federal support. Can you comment on the state of rural
infrastructure as it relates to the efficient movement of
goods?
How important is it to America's agriculture sector that
local roads and bridges networks are in a state of good repair?
Mr. VanderWal. Well, thank you for that question.
Our local roads are hugely important to us, and we have
found that, just in the last few years now, they are starting
to deteriorate. And the local governments are really struggling
to keep up because of inflation, higher costs, higher
contractor costs, and all those things.
And if you think about it, every road we have is crucial,
even a township road that has gravel on it. In South Dakota,
there is a tremendous number of those. But to the people that
farm beside those roads, they are hugely important, because
that's how they get their products to market.
So, we struggle a bit--in South Dakota, in particular--with
those local and township roads getting to the State roads. But
it is all part of the system that we are dealing with, and it
is hugely important.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. Having served in local government,
I have represented urban and rural communities, so, thank you
very much for that.
Mr. Koles, much of America, including many communities in
my home State of California, are rural and face capacity
constraints. From your perspective, have you experienced
financial and personnel capacity limits?
If so, how do these limits impact your ability to meet your
local infrastructure goals and responsibilities?
Mr. Koles. Certainly, there are capacity issues in our
small, rural communities. Personnel is lacking. We squeeze
blood out of a turnip, from a budget standpoint. So, the staff
has everything they can do to take care of the roads, let alone
think about how do we improve safety, how do we get a grant, et
cetera.
Because you can't often afford personnel to be able to do
that, then you can't afford to hire a grant writer. In addition
to not being able to afford a grant writer, we have a number of
areas of the country where grant writers just aren't available.
If you are a private-sector grant writer, you are not going to
exist in an area that has a low-density population. So, even if
you were blessed with the money to try to purchase a grant
writer, they are not available. That lack of access creates a
real inequity between rural communities and urban communities.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Mr. Morrow, a lot of folks in smaller communities feel like
public transit access is simply out of reach. Can you share any
rural transit best practices other stakeholders might benefit
from?
Mr. Morrow. Thank you for the question. Yes, the on-demand
mode of service, where you don't just run a bus or rely on
buses to be constantly running but respond when someone wants a
trip, is a cost-effective way to meet that demand. And
actually, that's happening today across America in many of our
rural communities and urban communities, as well. And that
seems to work well to help.
The other piece of it is just all of us work together,
including those of us who are here, but back in our communities
and State to try to have more funding and, if there isn't
funding available, work with nonprofits or others so that they
have the vehicle so that they can step in if the public transit
agency can't do that work themselves.
So, there are other partnership opportunities. Thank you.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Morrow, as a followup
question, we know that 3.6 million people in the United States
do not obtain medical care due to transportation issues. This
includes lack of vehicle access, inadequate infrastructure,
long distances to reach needed services, and transportation
costs. In short, transportation issues can impact a person's
ability to access healthcare and become a social detriment to
their health.
What are some of the policy recommendations we should
consider to ensure equitable access to transportation for all
communities?
Mr. Morrow. Well, funding, that's what it comes down to in
most cases. And in fact, a big part of our paratransit
business, the work that we provide, is helping people get to
dialysis, for instance, which is an important thing. So, I
would ask for consideration of more funding for those trips,
because they are the most expensive that we all do. Thank you.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Mr. Chair, I am out of time, I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Mr. Collins.
Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I kind of want to
preface my questions, first of all: I am in the trucking
business, and so, we use a lot of the interstates and the
highways across this country every day. And, Mr. Koles, I want
to get right into this thing. Do you all see commercial
truckdrivers on local roads?
Mr. Koles. Absolutely.
Mr. Collins. And I don't think I have to ask you what the
impacts are on those local roads. And I think the reason is
because they are using these driver apps, or these Google Maps,
or whatever map app that they are using to get through, to get
to their destination.
Rural towns, do they have mass transit?
Mr. Koles. The only transit we have in rural towns is
shared-ride taxi in the State of Wisconsin, so, we aren't, in
our State, using bus service at all.
Mr. Collins. I have got over 20 counties. We don't have
mass transit in any of them, except for Athens, Georgia, for
the University of Georgia. Mass transit in our rural towns is a
mom with a boatload of kids, taking them to the recreation
department or wherever she may be taking them for the day.
I would like to ask just one more quick question. Would you
prefer a bypass or a bypass around small towns?
Mr. Koles. A bypass or a bypass?
Mr. Collins. Bypass or a bike path.
Mr. Koles. Oh, a bypass.
Mr. Collins. How about electric charging stations or maybe
passing lanes on these rural highways?
Mr. Koles. Passing lanes.
Mr. Collins. Yes, sir. I would agree 100 percent.
There is a reason, Mr. Chairman, that you are seeing these
commercial trucks on these local highways. It is because our
interstates are jampacked daily all across the United States.
And it is getting worse, forcing these commercial truckers to
have to go off and try to use these local highways in these
local towns to make their deliveries on time.
And there is a reason for that, you all. We have got an
administration and we have got a Department of Transportation
that is focused on DEI initiatives that are focused more on
electric vehicles and mass transit, this fantasy that they want
to push across all of America. They don't even want a rural
America, actually. They would much rather see us piled up in
some metropolitan areas, where they figure that you will
actually be dependent on them. So, that is why they keep
pushing for more Federal funding, that free money that they
want to give you, the reason we are $34 trillion in debt.
Actually, rural Americans thrive on being self-sufficient.
They can provide for their families. They know how to get to
the doctor, the grocery store, the pharmacy. We have done it
ever since this country was created. And we will continue to do
it tomorrow.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Ms. Hoyle.
Ms. Hoyle of Oregon. Thank you very much.
My district, Oregon's Fourth Congressional District, is a
largely rural district that includes Oregon's south coast and
the Willamette and Umpqua Valleys. It is Willamette like damn
it, so, if anyone asks you. We have two major issues.
The first is, like most rural areas, we have an extreme
backlog of infrastructure investments. For instance, in two of
the six counties that I represent, Lane and Douglas County,
each one of which is about the size of Connecticut, we have 700
bridges, the vast majority of which were built in the 1950s and
1960s, that are in dire need of repair or replacement.
We have also been relying on the Highway Trust Fund to fund
these projects, which is facing insolvency because we are
relying on a gas tax. We need to figure out how to deal with
that as we move away from fossil fuel. That's a conversation
for a different day, but an urgent and important one. The fact
is the Highway Trust Fund is becoming insolvent.
So, I have two questions. One is, there are clear economic
benefits we see from investing in rural roads and bridges. How
can Congress help spur more investment in rural bridges,
especially the off-system bridges, those owned by counties and
cities? Because, according to what I am hearing from my rural
counties, the Federal cost-benefit analysis tends to prioritize
higher traffic volumes, higher population densities, which
disadvantages rural transportation projects and makes their
needs less competitive.
And again, we are shipping. We are feeding the world. We
are feeding the country. What we grow, what we raise, what we
catch, everyone else needs to eat, right?
So, my question is, what benefits should we consider when
discussing rural projects?
I know there are grants, but as everyone has said, rural
communities don't have giant grant writing parts of the--
everybody does everything in small communities.
The second major issue is a lack of workforce, specifically
in busdrivers and truckdrivers, which is exacerbated in rural
communities as the job is more difficult, and we again have
great need to move the food we grow, raise, and catch.
In your views, what are the main reasons why recruitment
and retention of busdrivers and truckdrivers are so difficult?
And what are your views on utilizing the apprenticeship
programs to recruit, train, and retain busdrivers and
truckdrivers?
Because again, this is an issue. I will start with Mr.
Morrow, but I will open it up in the 2\1/2\ minutes we have
left.
Mr. Morrow. Thank you very much. I wish I had the answers
to those questions about recruitment because, if we did, we
would be implementing them.
Obviously, pay is top of mind, and we work through a
collective bargaining agreement to address that. Other
benefits, retention, hiring bonuses, all of those sorts of
things, referral bonuses, things like that, but also the
benefits that we can offer, we try to share that because in a
governmental setting, we are fortunate to have some really
strong benefits that support families, as well as the employee,
things like that.
And then we try to reach out to the veterans community,
others to find good talent. It's difficult. I think it's
difficult everywhere.
Ms. Hoyle of Oregon. So, I think the first part is also
that we have difficulty recruiting CDL drivers everywhere, but
in rural communities, where they are driving buses and they are
driving trucks, it is really difficult because the
infrastructure is crumbling. So, if they can pick riding in a
city and sitting in traffic, they will do that.
And we desperately need to get the investment. So, how do
we deal with the weight that's given to the urban, more
populous areas?
And how do we recruit and retain more people?
Anybody.
Mr. Greteman. Thank you for the question. I believe right
now there is an issue with getting CDL drivers--getting an
actual CDL. There is a waiting period, there is a 14-day
waiting period after a driver actually takes and passes the
written exams before they can come and do the driving test. And
then oftentimes, due to limited availability of CDL testing,
you can't get an appointment to do that for another 2 to 3
weeks. So, all of a sudden, you are looking at a----
Ms. Hoyle of Oregon [interrupting]. I hate to interrupt,
but it is short. But the key thing is we don't have the
infrastructure. So, dealing with how do rural communities
compete against urban areas, when we are feeding the country
and the world.
Mr. Koles, you look like you want to say----
Mr. Koles [interrupting]. I will be really brief, because
your time is about to expire. Formula funds are better than
discretionary grants.
In our State, our secretary chose to take almost all of the
bridge formula program funds that came in IIJA and send it to
off-system bridges. It has been a huge help.
The other thing that you talked about, cost-benefit
analysis, ADT is not necessarily the right metric because it
doesn't measure type or weight.
Mr. Crawford. The gentlewoman's time has expired. Mr.
LaMalfa.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Kind of following up
on that thought here a little bit, I have been thinking about
this grant writing situation here a little bit, and for a long
time, but it has been a hot topic today. And Mr. Koles was
speaking with Ms. Hoyle about that.
And would you expand a little bit on what--I mean, we could
just, we are almost alone here now, we can talk. If we just
eliminated the grant writers and that grant writing process
and--the terminology used a second ago--on a more direct route
of funds there, I mean, how do you think we could really
aggressively move towards that?
Because every small county, small town, small jurisdiction,
they can't compete with somebody somewhere else with great, big
grant writers and a big budget for all that. So, talk a little
about what would that look like if we could just wipe the slate
and say----
Mr. Koles [interrupting]. Just--so, we are talking
discretionary versus formula. We would much prefer formula
funds because it allows the State's discretion to distribute it
in a much more flexible manner.
A couple of things that we could do with regard to the
surface transportation program, and we actually have an example
of this. In the FAST Act, we allowed the States to use 15
percent of their lowest cohort. So, STP--Surface Transportation
Fund--is distributed amongst cohorts. The two lowest cohorts,
you could take 15 percent of that and get it down to local
roads and minor collector roads. That's where the action is at.
Those are the farm fields and the forest entrances and the
quarry entrances. We could expand upon that in the surface
transportation program by increasing that percentage.
We can also have a scenario where you look at how those
cohorts are distributed differently. Right now it's based on
population, rather than lane-miles.
Mr. LaMalfa. Well, and there is the thing, because in my
home State of California, which probably shouldn't be an
example, but we are so much getting run over by the needs of
the very large cities. It is probably common to most States,
but we struggle. We struggle with trying to get at least
something equitable in some fashion in our rural areas.
Let me jump to Mr. VanderWal, and I might come back to you,
Mr. Koles.
In a recent hearing we talked a lot about at-grade
crossings, railroad crossings. And the panel we had that day
was big on pushing, the best crossing isn't--eliminate at-grade
crossing and have all split-grade. But the price of them we got
out of that hearing was at least $40 million, typically, to
build a split-grade crossing where you had an at-grade before.
And probably in my home State it is double that because
everything has to be so freaking expensive in California. So,
$40 to $80 million it could be.
So, talking from a rural aspect, especially from a farmer,
as a fellow farmer here, if they are really aggressive on
eliminating at-grade crossings, what is that going to look like
for agriculture, for movement of raw materials, and finished
fuel products, and tractors, and all that stuff?
Mr. VanderWal. Well, thank you for that question. If I am
understanding your question right--I am having a hard time
hearing over the echo some. But when you talk about split-grade
crossing, you mean the overpasses with interstates, that kind
of thing?
Mr. LaMalfa. Well, yes, I mean, even in a small town--like,
I picture a town--I have my district called Los Molinos there,
which is basically one main crossing in town. If they said,
``You've got to come up with 40 million bucks to have a split-
grade,'' they are not going to find that kind of money.
And so--and then all down the line where you have
driveways, you have homes, you have small farms that have them
even with no lights on them. How are we going to go about--if
they are going to be this aggressive on shutting them down just
to shut them down, what is that going to do to our sector?
Mr. VanderWal. Yes, thank you for the clarification. That
would be a major problem, because there are so many of these
rural areas we don't even have a road every mile in some cases.
And if a person has to drive, let's say, 5 miles around an
interchange like that that might disappear, that is a huge
economic imposition.
Some areas have put in rotaries. They don't understand
semitrucks have to go around those, and they make them too
tight, and there are all kinds of issues like that that people
from Washington don't understand how it really works in the
local areas.
Mr. LaMalfa. Well, we are seeing prime examples of that in
California with this high-cost rail--did I say ``cost''? High-
speed rail system we are putting through the valley that is
just cutting off vast areas, and you are seeing farmers--like I
got a tractor pulling a folded up disc or a combine with a wide
header on it, and I got to go 5 miles up this way whereas you
can just jump across at these other crossings. And that is a
real impact. It is probably even a safety one. They talk safety
all the time, but having to go so much farther with all this
equipment. So, I wish I had time to throw it to Mr. Koles, what
he deals with, but maybe in a different comment.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Mr. Duarte.
Mr. Duarte. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you to the
panel. Good to have you here today.
Mr. VanderWal, a long-term Farm Bureau member, a board
member for 10 years in my local Farm Bureau. We have got an
administration that is administering the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
funds to a great extent out of a White House office, not
through formulas, not through DOT grants solely, but literally
has a White House office to hand this out and, in my opinion,
politicize the awards.
In California--I am from a rural county in California--we
also have a very blue State government. And that doesn't bode
well for red rural counties, in terms of getting our share. The
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act awards grants that we
just saw a few months ago put $3.1 billion in my district for
high-speed rail, which Congressman LaMalfa just touched on, and
very little to actual highways that anyone is going to use, any
resources the next 20 years.
We look at the electrification, we look at how this
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act money is being spent. We
look at rural communities that produce most of our food here in
America, that solve most of our logistics challenges and get
that food to market.
Net-net, in your opinion and from your experience, is this
administration enhancing food security with these trillions of
dollars of investment, or are we moving backwards in food
security for the United States?
Mr. VanderWal. Well, thank you for that question, and I
think it comes down to priorities.
And when you talk about the high-speed rail line,
obviously, we can't haul anything on that in regard to ag
products. We certainly need to keep priorities in line and
remember that the local areas are really best suited to
determine what their needs are.
And so, a grant program that is out there, if it comes down
with a whole bunch of regulations and requirements and things,
that is not very productive. We need to let the local areas
have the autonomy to identify their own needs. And if we can
then use that money for the productive use that it needs to be
used for in local areas, then that is the way to do it.
Mr. Duarte. Yes. Let's go to the grant writing. That has
been a topic. And we just--a few weeks ago, we had a person,
Stacey Mortensen from the Altamont Corridor Express, which is
an Amtrak enhancement that will move people from Modesto and
Stockton and Merced to the bay area for the job market in the
bay area. It is a big deal. It is a project I do support, as
opposed to high-speed rail, which I think is an endless $204-
million-a-mile boondoggle. The Altamont Corridor Express does
hold out hope for being practical.
When you take the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
money and apply for grants, you have got to review a Made in
America constituent to it, you have got to have a carbon-
friendly constituent to the application process. You have got
to have a DEI, social justice constituent to the process. And
much less than even knowing how to fill these out or what the
standards are, we don't even yet have standards for these.
Several years later under the Biden administration, with their
own office to deal with this stuff, doesn't yet have clear
standards to how these criterion can be met so the grants can
be awarded. The money hasn't flowed out to major urban areas,
much less rural areas.
Are we on any realistic path with the trillions of dollars
in debt America is taking on with the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act to actually solve our rural issues in
transportation?
Mr. VanderWal. Well, I think that is an excellent question,
and I am not sure I have a solid answer for it, other than the
fact that we are very much opposed to all these requirements
being put on. When you have to meet certain tests when you go
through this process, it just complicates the whole issue and
makes it a lot harder for rural governments, especially, to
qualify.
We would go back to what we are already doing, the biofuels
that we are raising, and reducing the carbon footprint already.
And that's what this Government wants us to do. We have got the
solution right here, and we just need to promote that, and
maybe even carry it a little further and go toward the
sustainable aviation fuels and things like that that we can
produce with our products.
Mr. Duarte. Thank you. I will open those questions and
those themes up to the rest of the panel if there is other
input.
Mr. Koles. We have to remember that milk comes from a farm,
not from the grocery store. And so, this is about a proportion
of the trillions of dollars that were invested proportionately
because of the way the Federal system has been designed,
getting it down to those local roads and those minor
collectors, which are 75 percent of the entire system in rural
America. It's just not going to happen. There are limited
examples of getting it down to those local roads where the
farmers and the loggers and the miners actually do the----
Mr. Duarte [interrupting]. So, would any members of the
panel agree that a formula system by county, similar to COVID
relief funds, would be more effective than the grant system?
Mr. Crawford. Quick answer.
Mr. Koles. Formula funds are always better.
Mr. Duarte. Thank you.
I yield back. Thank you, Chair.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Mr. Burlison.
Mr. Burlison. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. VanderWal, as you well know, farming is one of the most
difficult jobs or professions in the United States. But to make
matters difficult, farmers now have to wade through regulation
after regulation, many of which are being made by people who
were not elected. To me, it's a challenge.
People talk about democracy being under threat. There is
nothing that threatens democracy more than to have unelected
people who represent no one making decisions that affect
everyone. And so, this includes initiatives and orders from
this administration on climate change, which has hurt our
farming and transportation sectors across the country. This
includes the methane emission regulations, and then the fuel
emission standards that are going to impact all of our
vehicles.
So, my question is, do you think that the average farmer is
more worried about climate change, or are they more worried
about keeping their business going?
Mr. VanderWal. Yes, thank you, sir, for that question.
There is no question that the average farmer is more focused on
remaining profitable and staying in business.
We are in a position right now, just starting a few months
ago, where, for corn and soybeans anyway, we are under cost of
production. And it comes down to inflation. It comes down to
all the costs that we have seen, fertilizer, crop production,
chemicals, all those things. And when we have more requirements
put on us by the Federal Government, it just increases
expenses.
Labor is one really good example, as well. The increased
labor that comes along with the H-2A program that a lot of
people are forced to use in fruits and vegetables, especially,
just adds costs.
And so, certainly, farmers are very insulted by the focus,
the laser focus on climate change and what to do about it, and
they are sitting here thinking, I am just trying to hold my
business together and hopefully my family will have a chance to
run it someday.
Mr. Burlison. Are you familiar with the new EPA proposed
rule on meat processing facilities?
Mr. VanderWal. I need to ask more questions----
Mr. Burlison [interrupting]. So, they basically have a new
rule related to the waste that's produced and requiring
treatment on site of water for these facilities.
In response to that, what I find, Mr. VanderWal, is that
Congress ends up playing Whac-A-Mole with all the--most of the
laws that are filed are trying to address the Executive orders
that have been implemented by someone who was not elected,
people that are basically trying to act as though they are the
legislative branch.
One of the bills in response that I have sponsored is
called the BEEF Act, which would reverse that EPA proposed rule
on the meat processing facilities. And another one is this new
requirement that cattle ranchers have to get a prescription for
the antibiotics to keep their--sometimes their calves alive,
which is why I sponsored, along with Representative Brecheen,
the Stop Government Overreach in Ranching Act.
These are just two of the most ridiculous new Executive
orders that are written by people that have no idea what it is
like to be a farmer. Would you agree?
Mr. VanderWal. I do agree, and your example of the VFDs for
using antibiotics is right on target. We resisted that back
when they put it in place, and of course it did go into effect.
It is a hassle, though, for a producer to have to call their
vet, and typically the vet just writes up the prescription, or
the VFD, Veterinary Feed Directive, and you get it done.
If there is a benefit to it, it deepens the relationship
between producers and their veterinarians. But we think there
would have been a more simple way to do it.
Mr. Burlison. And how is the agriculture--the farming
community impacted by these new transportation regulations?
Mr. VanderWal. Well, anything that makes it more difficult
and adds burdensome regulations is a very big concern to us.
I think I have said it before, but with these grant
programs or whatever the situation is, we need to let our local
governments have more autonomy to respond to the local needs
that are out there.
Mr. Burlison. And not to step over you, but I have just a
few seconds left and I want to get your comment on do you
believe that the Federal Government could use its dollars more
wisely?
I know that, for example, we are spending $7.5 billion to
fund electric vehicle charging stations that I think would not
benefit rural Missouri whatsoever.
Mr. VanderWal. Well, I think you are correct in that, and
consumers are telling us what their thoughts are about that
through the lack of market for electric vehicles. People just
aren't interested in buying them. And I think we need to find a
happy medium someplace in there.
Mr. Burlison. Thank you.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Mr. D'Esposito.
Mr. D'Esposito. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Greteman, thank you for being here, thank you all for
being here.
So, I am not sure if you are familiar with what is going on
back in New York, but we have a State legislature and a
Governor, all three Democrats, who have been over the last few
years known for, really, their overreach. We had their attempt
to eliminate local zoning so that they could build housing in
communities. Governor Hochul has what is called the RAPID Act,
which is proposed, basically taking the local voice out of
permitting processes for their green agenda. We have seen the
disasters of criminal justice reform and cashless bail, where
bureaucrats in Albany decided to give criminals more power than
police officers and law enforcement, legitimately taking the
handcuffs away from the police and really handcuffing law
enforcement from doing their jobs.
And now there is another overreach coming. And for far too
long in New York and the tristate area, the MTA has really
served as--really, the MTA has become the ATM for the State.
And what we are seeing is that they want to impose what is
called congestion pricing, and they are selling it as a plan to
have people increase ridership on the subways, but the fact is
that people aren't riding the subways because they don't want
to get either, one, thrown in front of it; or, two, stabbed or
shot. It's not because they just want to drive, it's because
they are too afraid to be in the subway. But nonetheless, they
have decided once again for the people and the hard-working
people that live in New York and on Long Island to serve as the
ATM for the MTA.
So, we have a motorcoach company that services Long Island
from New York City, and they recently sent an email to its
riders saying that the company will pay more than 30 percent
per week in tolls if congestion pricing goes into effect. And
you mentioned in your testimony that the bus companies are
already struggling to remain viable post-pandemic, and
operators are facing various strains on their operation,
whether it's operators, whether it's the ability for the riders
to utilize the buses.
Can you talk about how adding costs, and specifically this
disaster and overreach of congestion pricing, how it would
affect the American Bus Association members in the New York
tristate area?
Mr. Greteman. Yes, absolutely, and thank you for the
question.
It is going to affect the member bus companies very
adversely. It's extra expense. It's extra costs that are really
no more than a tax. Motorcoaches, buses, they are already
removing cars from the road. Each motorcoach can remove up to
56 cars from the road, and so, we are already doing our part to
reduce congestion.
If this is really about congestion mitigation----
Mr. D'Esposito [interposing]. Which it's not.
Mr. Greteman [continuing]. Which it's not, it sounds like
it's, from what I know, it's more about the MTA budget
shortfalls and how to fund that. And coming up with this plan
penalizes private operators like Hampton Jitney and every other
private bus operator in New Jersey and New York that does their
part to bring people into the city that are spending money at
the theaters, at the restaurants, doing sightseeing and
whatnot. And all of a sudden, it's just another tax that
private operators are forced to foot the bill.
Mr. D'Esposito. And you know what? You said it best when
you said it penalizes operators, and it's just another tax.
And when the MTA was asked, and the Governor was asked,
well, what is this congestion pricing about, why do you need
the money. Because, like you said, it's not about reducing
congestion, it's about, so they say, having people ride the
subways and the buses, which they don't want to because they
are scared--we have spoken to the transit workers union, the
transportation workers union, who said they are even afraid for
themselves on the trains.
And one of the reasons as to why, and which shows that they
are just doubling down and they really don't care about the
American people--and in this case, New Yorkers, Long Islanders,
and the tristate area--is because they have lost so much money
because of theft of service. Why? Because people have no reason
to pay to be on the subway, or be on the buses, or to pay for
the Long Island Rail Road because there is no reason to,
because now you could just jump the turnstile, you can't get
stopped, you are not going to get arrested or given a summons.
So, why pay?
So, they have created this disaster, and now they are
passing it on to operators like you. And like you said, it is
just another tax. And if you could, monetize, just in your
situation, what this could cost you per year if this goes into
effect.
Mr. Greteman. I can't give you an estimate on that. But for
the operators in New York and New Jersey, it is in the
millions, millions of dollars.
Mr. D'Esposito. Millions of dollars on local business
owners who probably, in the situation that you have described,
may not even be able to continue in business because they are
already facing shortfalls. So, now they are getting, like you
said, another tax, an attack on local business with the sole
purpose of filling budget shortfalls, not trying to reduce
congestion, and certainly not increasing ridership on the
subways because no one wants to ride them because they are too
scared because of cashless bail and criminal justice reform
that Democrats like Kathy Hochul implemented.
My time is expired, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. And are there any
further questions from any other members on the committee?
Seeing none, that concludes our hearing for today. I would
like to thank each of the witnesses for your testimony. The
committee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:13 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

Hearing on Rural Highway and Transit Challenges and Problems

Dear Committee:
Thank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony. I am
Anthony Dimas Jr., County Manager for McKinley County, New Mexico. Over
the past several years, McKinley County has worked tirelessly with the
Navajo Nation to secure funding to repair 36 dilapidated bridges. These
bridges are in such a dire state that, without funding and repair, they
face imminent closure. Such closures will result in detours of upwards
of one hour for residents. As it stands, many of the bridges are unsafe
for ambulances, fire trucks, including water tankers (for rural fire
fighting) and school buses to cross, endangering residents who rely on
these services. The bridge repair effort is complicated by many
factors, including a lack of adequate funding and the multitude of
property ownership interests at stake. Both the Navajo Nation and
McKinley County have strived to secure funding, only to come up short,
and both parties are working tirelessly to solve a looming rights-of-
way issue that threatens to halt or delay the project. These bridges
are located on a variety of properties from Navajo Nation Tribal land,
Fee Land, BIA Land, BLM Land, Forest Land, Trust Land to County owned
land to private land. The rights-of-way requirements that come with
construction on Tribal land and private property have posed a
significant obstacle to securing funding.
I write to you today to highlight the funding challenges faced by
Tribes and the rights-of-way issues that plague construction and repair
projects on Tribal lands. In February 2024, USA Today \1\ highlighted
the staggering lack of funding in northwest New Mexico, specifically in
McKinley County, ``it's exactly the type of disadvantaged place the
Biden administration promised would benefit from a massive influx of
federal money for safer streets. McKinely County is poor and home to
Native communities often left out of such programs. But two years into
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's rollout, many places like Gallup
(in McKinley County) have received little help even as millions go
unused.'' McKinley County is in dire need of transportation funding,
with some of the highest traffic fatality rates in the country.
However, no funding is being awarded to the nation's poorest and more
rural areas.

safe-streets-money-misses-needy-counties-data-investigation/
71722408007/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to the challenges listed above (rights-of-way issues
and overlapping property ownership interests), McKinley County, and
rural communities like Navajo Nation and Gallup, NM, lack the capacity
to complete, submit, and manage onerous federal grants. As a result,
poor rural and Tribal communities are losing out on funding to
wealthier towns and cities that have the capacity to compete for this
funding. This means that some of our nation's neediest communities, the
communities for which transportation grant programs were designed, are
going without recognition and without funding.
As noted above, McKinley County, in particular, is facing enormous
challenges in securing wide-scale rights-of-way across a multitude of
land interests in order to repair and reconstruct dilapidated bridges.
In order to proceed with construction, McKinley County and Navajo
Nation must secure a traditional right of way to access the land on
which the bridge is located. The various land interests at stake in
this project across the 36 dilapidated bridges pose a significant
obstacle to securing rights-of-way. Rural communities across the
country, especially those that overlap with Tribal lands, face similar
issues in securing authorization for road and safety improvements. This
obstacle threatens to delay or halt critical projects.
As you consider the rural highway and transit challenges as part of
today's hearing, please give thought to the funding and access issues
faced by many rural and Tribal communities. This is just a small part
of the many challenges faced by rural areas in repairing and
constructing our nation's transportation infrastructure.
Thank you for your attention and dedication to this topic.
Sincerely,
Anthony Dimas Jr.,
County Manager, McKinley County, New Mexico.

Letter and Attachment of March 22, 2024, to Hon. Eric A. ``Rick''
Crawford, Chairman, and Hon. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, from Jack Waldorf, Executive
Director, Western Governors' Association, Submitted for the Record by
Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
March 22, 2024.
The Honorable Rick Crawford,
Chairman,
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure, House of Representatives, 2165 Rayburn House
Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Eleanor Holmes Norton,
Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure, House of Representatives, 2165 Rayburn House
Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman Crawford and Ranking Member Norton:
With respect to the Subcommittee's March 21, 2024, hearing, Rural
Transportation Challenges: Stakeholder Perspectives, attached please
find Western Governors' Association (WGA) Policy Resolution 2021-07,
Transportation Infrastructure in the Western United States. This
resolution includes Western Governors' collective and bipartisan policy
recommendations concerning transportation in the western United States.
Transportation needs in the West differ significantly from those of
eastern states. Remote rural communities, underinvested infrastructure,
and an increased movement of people and goods have strained the West's
network of infrastructure. Western Governors believe there is a strong
federal role, in partnership with the states and local governments, for
continued investment in our surface transportation network--
particularly on federal routes and in multimodal transportation
networks throughout the West that are critical to interstate commerce
and a growing economy. Specifically, Western Governors believe the
current project decision-making role of state and local governments,
with meaningful participation from affected communities, particularly
tribes and historically underserved communities, in investment
decisions should continue. Western Governors desire additional
flexibility to determine how and where to deploy investment to maximize
the use of scarce resources.
I request that you include this document in the permanent record of
the hearing, as it articulates Western Governors' policy positions and
recommendations on this important issue.
Thank you for your consideration of this request. Please contact me
if you have any questions or require further information.
Sincerely,
Jack Waldorf,
Executive Director, Western Governors' Association.

Attachment
Western Governors' Association
Policy Resolution 2021-07
Transportation Infrastructure in the Western United States
A. BACKGROUND
Surface Transportation
1.  The American West encompasses a huge land mass representing 2.4
million square miles or over two-thirds of the entire country. Over 116
million people live in these states and they reside in large, densely
populated cities, smaller cities and towns and in rural areas.

2.  Perhaps more than any other region, terrain and landownership
patterns in the West underscore the purpose and vital need for a
federal role in surface transportation. Western states are responsible
for vast expanses of national highways and interstates that often do
not correlate with population centers but serve as critical national
freight and transportation routes for the nation.

3.  Western states ports are national assets, moving needed parts
and retail goods into the country, while also providing the gateway for
our nation's exports. Although they benefit the entire country, the
financial burden of developing, expanding and maintaining them to meet
the demands of growing trade is almost entirely borne at the state and
local level.

4.  The vast stretches of highways and railroad track that connect
the West to the nation do not have the population densities seen in the
eastern United States.

5.  Raising private funds to carry forward infrastructure projects
in the rural West will be extremely challenging. The low traffic
volumes in rural states will not support tolls, even if one wanted to
impose them. Projects in rural areas are unlikely to generate revenues
that will attract investors to finance those projects, even if the
revenues are supplemented by tax credits. Some western states have
implemented or are developing mileage-based fee programs as an
additional tool to enhance funding.
Transportation Infrastructure
6.  Jobs, the economy and quality of life in the West depend on
high quality transportation infrastructure that efficiently,
effectively and safely moves goods and people. Western transportation
infrastructure is part of a national network that serves national
interests. Among other things, transportation infrastructure in the
West: moves agricultural and natural resource products from source to
national and world markets; carries goods from western ports on western
highways and railroad track to eastern and southern cities; and enables
travelers to visit the great National Parks and other destinations in
the West.

7.  The transportation and transit needs in the West differ
significantly from our eastern counterparts. Western states are
building new capacity to keep up with growth, including new
interstates, new multimodal systems including high-speed passenger rail
and light rail transit systems, biking and pedestrian options, and
increased capacity on existing infrastructure.

8.  The infrastructure in the region is under strain from both
increased movement of goods and people and from underinvestment in
preservation and repair and new infrastructure needed to keep pace with
this growth and change. Positive and productive partnerships between
state department of transportation offices and their local U.S.
Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA) office have enabled innovative advances in infrastructure
funding and development.

9.  Modernizing and maintaining the West's network of
infrastructure relies upon permitting and review processes that require
close coordination and consultation among state, federal and tribal
governments. State, federal and tribal coordination is necessary to
ensure that infrastructure projects are designed, financed, built,
operated and maintained in a manner that meets the needs of our
economies, environment, public health, safety and security. Early,
ongoing, substantial, and meaningful state-federal consultation can
provide efficiency, transparency, and predictability for states and
tribes, as well as prevent delays, in the federal permitting and
environmental review process.

10.  State and local governments often have the best available
science, data and expertise related to natural resources within their
borders. In cases where the states have primary management authority,
such as wildlife and water governance, states also possess the most
experience in managing those resources and knowledge of state- and
locality-specific considerations that should inform infrastructure
siting decisions.

11.  The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), since its
enactment in 1970, has required that federal agencies consider how
proposed federal actions may affect natural, cultural, economic and
social resources for present and future generations of Americans. The
process by which NEPA is implemented has been defined over time through
regulations and guidance issued by the Council on Environmental Quality
(CEQ).

12.  On April 27, 2021, FHWA issued a guidance document [https://
www.fhwa.dot.gov/real_estate/right-of-way/corridor_management/
alternative_uses_guidance.cfm], State DOTs Leveraging Alternative Uses
of the Highway Right-of-Way Guidance. The guidance encourages FHWA
division offices to work with state departments of transportation in
order to leverage highway rights-of-way (ROWs) for the siting of
renewable energy projects, transmission and distribution assets,
broadband infrastructure, and alternative fueling facilities.
Electric Vehicle Infrastructure
13.  WGA recently executed the Electric Vehicles Roadmap
Initiative, its signature policy project for Fiscal Year 2021. The
Initiative was principally focused on the planning, siting and
coordination of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in
western states and explored a number of federal policy issues that
affect the buildout of this infrastructure.

14.  Western Governors and states are exhibiting strong leadership
on EV infrastructure planning, coordination, and investment. Many
western states are actively collaborating with each other via their
engagement in the West Coast Electric Highway \1\ and Regional Electric
Vehicles Plan for the West \2\ (REV West).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ California, Oregon and Washington are members of the West Coast
Electric Highway.
\2\ Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah,
and Wyoming are members of the REV West.

15.  Western states face a suite of challenges related to planning
and siting EV infrastructure, including the unique needs of both
underserved and rural communities, vast distances between communities,
limited electric grid infrastructure in sparsely populated areas, and a
patchwork of federal, state, and private lands ownership boundaries.
These factors combine to make EV infrastructure installations more
logistically challenging and costly, regardless of whether the
infrastructure is funded by public or private sources or a combination
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
of the two.

16.  Many western states have engaged with and submitted corridor
nominations to the FHWA's Alternative Fuel Corridors Program. The
Program assigns ``Corridor-Pending'' and ``Corridor-Ready''
designations for interstate, U.S. route, and state highways.

17.  In order to meet the ``Corridor-Pending'' and ``Corridor-
Ready'' metrics, charging or alternative fueling infrastructure must be
sited every 100 or 50 miles, respectively, along the proposed corridor.
A number of western states have experienced challenges in meeting these
defined metrics due to lacking electric infrastructure and suitable
charging locations in sparsely populated areas.

18.  23 U.S.C. 111 prohibits Interstate System rest areas built
after January 1, 1960, from offering commercial services such as fuel
and food on the Interstate System right-of-way. Due to this
prohibition, EV charging stations may be sited at Interstate System
rest areas, but no fee may be charged for the electricity that is
dispensed. This significantly complicates the business case for siting
EV charging infrastructure at these rest areas. Western Governors
support amending 23 U.S.C. 111 to allow commercial EV charging at all
rest areas along the Interstate, but we would note that western states
are especially affected by the current prohibition because many rest
areas in the West are located far from communities or businesses that
could offer suitable locations for EV charging.

19.  Western states contain many public federal lands, including
areas managed by the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service
and U.S. Forest Service. Many of these federal lands serve as regional
tourism attractions and support economic development in rural western
communities. Creating and implementing efficient practices for
permitting and siting EV infrastructure on federal lands will help
support continued tourism and economic opportunities across the West.

20.  Private investments in zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) charging
and fueling infrastructure can be aided by supportive investment tax
credit structures. The current Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling
Property Investment Tax Credit could be enhanced to improve the
business case for private sector investment in ZEV charging and fueling
infrastructure.

21.  The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Vehicle Technologies
Office manages the Clean Cities Coalition (CCC) Program, which has
active members across the West. CCCs often serve a crucial role at the
local level by leading EV infrastructure planning and implementation
projects.

22.  The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted disruptions to domestic
supply chains across many sectors. On February 24, 2021, President
Biden signed an Executive Order on America's Supply Chains (EO 14017
[https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-03-01/pdf/2021-
04280.pdf]). The EO launches a comprehensive review of certain U.S.
supply chains and directs federal departments and agencies to identify
ways to secure U.S. supply chains against a wide range of risks and
vulnerabilities. Two supply chains included in the review are critical
minerals, including rare earth elements, and large capacity batteries
such as those used in electric vehicle production.

23.  Battery EVs require a number of critical minerals in their
production, including lithium, nickel and cobalt, among others.
Consumption of these critical minerals essential to EV supply chains
will rise as more EV batteries are produced. EVs sold in 2019 alone
accounted for more than one quarter of the total battery capacity
deployed nationwide.\3\ With increasing demand for EVs, it is projected
that demand for these minerals will concurrently increase in coming
decades.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aviation
24.  Lack of reliable air service is a significant barrier to
fulfilling the needs of rural communities in the West. Air service is
essential infrastructure for connecting many remote communities. It is
important not only to recreation and emergency services, but to
economic, social and cultural needs. In some communities it is the only
way to bring doctors or other non-local workers in and out of where
they work but may not live.

25.  The DOT Essential Air Service (EAS) Program was put into place
in 1978 to guarantee that small communities served by certificated air
carriers before passage of the Airline Deregulation Act maintained a
minimum level of scheduled air service. This is generally accomplished
by DOT subsidizing two round trips a day with 30- to 50-seat aircraft,
or additional frequencies with aircraft with 9 seats or fewer, usually
to a large- or medium-hub airport. The Department currently subsidizes
commuter and certificated air carriers to serve communities in Alaska
and in the lower 48 contiguous states that otherwise would not receive
any scheduled air service.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ DOT Essential Air Service Program https://
www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/small-community-rural-
air-service/essential-air-service

26.  Of the communities that participate in EAS, 63 percent are in
the West, illustrating the rurality of these areas and their need for
connectivity. EAS has a significant economic effect on rural
communities. A 1 percent increase in traffic to an EAS airport results
in a 0.12 percent increase in income for the entire community, and an 8
percent increase in traffic results in a 1 percent income increase.
Businesses need connectivity to the national and global economy to
succeed and rural communities with good air service are more attractive
to remote workers.\5\

westgov.org/images/editor/FINAL_RTRW_Appendix_2020.pdf

27.  The Small Community Air Service Development Program (SCASDP)
is a DOT grant program designed to help small communities address air
service and airfare issues. SCASDP's eligibility criteria are broader
than EAS and provide a grant applicant the opportunity to self-identify
its air service deficiencies and propose an appropriate solution
compared to an EAS direct subsidy.\6\ Air service started by the SCASDP
often continues without further funding once the grant is over,
exemplifying that the service proves itself to be commercially viable
beyond its value to the community and the public.\7\

B. GOVERNORS' POLICY STATEMENT
Surface Transportation
1.  Western Governors believe there is a strong federal role, in
partnership with the states and local governments, for the continued
investment in our surface transportation network--particularly on
federal routes and in multimodal transportation networks throughout the
West that are critical to interstate commerce and a growing economy.
These routes and networks traverse hundreds of miles without traffic
densities sufficient to either make public-private partnerships
feasible or allow state and local governments to raise capital beyond
the historic cost share.

2.  Western Governors believe the current project decision-making
role of state and local governments, with meaningful participation from
affected communities, particularly tribes and historically underserved
communities, in investment decisions should continue. Western Governors
desire additional flexibility to determine how and where to deploy
investment in order to maximize the use of scarce resources.

3.  Western Governors believe that a viable, long-term funding
mechanism is critical to the maintenance and expansion of our surface
transportation network and encourage Congress to work together to
identify a workable solution that adequately funds the unique needs of
the West.

4.  Western Governors believe in enhancing the ability to leverage
scarce resources by supplementing traditional base funding by creating
and enhancing financing mechanisms and tools that are appropriate for
all areas of the United States, including those with low traffic
densities where tolling and public private partnerships are not
feasible.

5.  Western Governors believe using the historic formula-based
approach for the distribution of funds would ensure that both rural and
urban states participate in any infrastructure initiative and it would
deliver the benefits of an infrastructure initiative to the public
promptly.

6.  Western Governors believe the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) and the
programs it supports are critically important to success in efforts to
maintain and improve America's surface transportation infrastructure.
Currently, the HTF will not be able to support even current federal
surface transportation program levels and will not meet the needs of
the country that will grow as the economy grows. Congress must provide
a long-term solution to ensure HTF solvency and provide for increased,
sustainable federal transportation investment through the HTF.

7.  Western Governors strongly encourage western states port
operators and their labor unions to work together to avoid future work
slowdowns by resolving labor issues well before contracts are set to
expire. In recent years, protracted disagreement in bargaining between
parties has had an adverse effect on the American economy that should
not be repeated.

8.  Western Governors believe modern ports infrastructure is
essential to strong national and western economy and urge Congress to
fully fund the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and to reform the Harbor
Maintenance Tax to ensure western ports remain competitive.
Furthermore, Western Governors believe the federal government must work
collaboratively with states, along with ports, local governments and
key private sector transportation providers like the railroads, to
ensure the necessary public and private investments to move imports and
exports efficiently through the intermodal system, as well as community
organizers and the Environmental Protection Agency's National
Environmental Justice Advisory Council to effectively mitigate
environmental and public health impacts to port communities.
Transportation Infrastructure
9.  Western Governors believe regulation accompanying federal
transportation programs should be evaluated and if necessary, revised
to encourage expediting project delivery and streamlining the
environmental review process without diminishing environmental
standards or safeguards.

10.  The federal infrastructure permitting and environmental review
process must be transparent, predictable, accessible and consistent for
states, project developers, and affected community stakeholders.
Federal processes must ensure that agencies set, and adhere to,
timelines and schedules for completion of reviews and develop improved
metrics for tracking and accountability.

11.  Federal programs that increase bottom-up coordination among
agencies, state and local governments and that foster collaboration
among project proponents and diverse stakeholders, particularly rural
communities, underserved communities, and tribes can create efficiency
and predictability in the NEPA process, including reducing the risks of
delays due to litigation.

12.  Western Governors encourage consistency in the implementation
of NEPA within and among agencies and across regions. The federal
government should identify and eliminate inconsistencies in
environmental review and analysis across agencies to make the process
more efficient.
Electric Vehicle Infrastructure
13.  Western Governors emphasize western states' collaborative
efforts to improve the planning and siting of EV charging
infrastructure to promote equitable access, particularly along highway
corridors, rural areas, underserved communities, or anywhere that users
do not have the ability to charge at home. We encourage Congress and
the Administration to leverage these state partnerships when designing
federal programs and allocating surface transportation and
infrastructure funds focused on EV infrastructure. Coordinating with
these multi-state groups would help promote targeted investments and
partnerships that expand cohesive, regional EV charging networks.

14.  Western Governors request that FHWA promote additional
flexibility within the Alternative Fuel Corridors program to recognize
the unique geographic and infrastructure conditions in western states.
Western Governors and states are eager to work with FHWA to ensure that
western states are not adversely affected by federal funding
opportunities that are tethered to Alternative Fuel Corridors
``Corridor-Pending'' and ``Corridor-Ready'' designations.

15.  Western Governors support legislative measures that address
prohibitions within 23 U.S.C. 111 that limit the siting of EV charging
stations at Interstate System rest areas and the issuance of a fee for
the use of that infrastructure.

16.  Promoting visitation to federal public lands and state parks
is a high priority for Western Governors. Western Governors would
welcome the opportunity to work with state and federal land management
agencies to address challenges that affect the permitting and siting of
EV charging infrastructure on state and federal public lands.

17.  Western Governors support legislative efforts that seek to
extend and expand the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property
Investment Tax Credit and improve the business case, especially in
rural and underserved areas, for private investment in ZEV charging and
refueling infrastructure.

18.  Western Governors emphasize the important functions that Clean
Cities Coalitions have served in coordinating and implementing ZEV
infrastructure projects across the West and encourage Congress to
provide funding support for the DOE Vehicle Technologies Office and
Clean Cities Coalition Network.

19.  Western Governors support strengthening domestic supply chains
of critical minerals vital to electric vehicle battery production
without compromising environmental and health and safety standards.
Governors also support development of emerging tools and technologies
that address barriers to mineral supply chain reliability, including
technologies that help recycle or reuse existing critical mineral
resources for use in electric vehicles and other clean energy
technologies.
Aviation
20.  Western Governors encourage the executive branch to include
full funding for the EAS and SCASDP programs in the President's annual
budget request. Western Governors also support legislative actions to
maintain and secure the longevity of these programs.
C. GOVERNORS' MANAGEMENT DIRECTIVE
1.  The Governors direct WGA staff to work with Congressional
committees of jurisdiction, the Executive Branch, and other entities,
where appropriate, to achieve the objectives of this resolution.

2.  Furthermore, the Governors direct WGA staff to consult with the
Staff Advisory Council regarding its efforts to realize the objectives
of this resolution and to keep the Governors apprised of its progress
in this regard.

This resolution will expire in June 2024. Western Governors enact new
policy resolutions and amend existing resolutions on a semiannual
basis. Please consult http://www.westgov.org/resolutions for the most
current copy of a resolution and a list of all current WGA policy
resolutions.

Questions from Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford to Jeff Greteman,
President and Chief Executive Officer, Windstar Lines, on behalf of the
American Bus Association

Question 1. In your testimony you referenced difficulties that
intercity and charter bus operators are facing regarding access to
intermodal facilities. As you described it, disrupting or prohibiting
this access means many operators are faced with less than desirable
options for passenger pick up and drop off as well as a lack of
passenger transit accessibility during their travel.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Rural Transportation Challenges: Stakeholder Perspectives:
Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Highways and Transit of the H. Comm. on
Transp. and Infrastructure, 118th Cong. (Mar. 21, 2024), (written
testimony of Mr. Jeff Greteman, President, Windstar Lines, Inc.).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1.a. What steps, if any, would you advocate to address
this problem?
Answer. Thank you for the question. Yes, as referenced in both my
oral and written testimony, bus operators are losing access to key
facilities and destination points providing intermodal connections.
These facilities are often publicly funded facilities, such as transit
stations, Amtrak stations and airports. From a public policy
standpoint, buses serving the public should have access to these
facilities. Intermodal connections provide efficiency from a customer
standpoint as well as a transportation network standpoint, and sustain
all modes involved. There is also the environmental benefit of
promoting intermodal connections, thereby eliminating the need for
additional, less climate friendly, modes of transport to fill the gap
such as taxis or car services.
Federal law explicitly directs publicly funded facilities to permit
access to such facilities by intercity bus operators. Yet, owners of
these facilities have found ways to get around the statute due to gaps
in the law or interpretive guidance. For example, title 49 U.S.C.
5323(r), states that a recipient of federal transit funding cannot deny
intercity buses from accessing federally funded public transportation
facilities. However, because ``reasonable'' is not defined in the
statute or through guidance, these recipients have used the ambiguity
to delay or simply ignore requests for access, or creatively deny
access through other means by trying to impose unreasonable conditions
such as excessive rent. Further, as with both 49 U.S.C. 5323(r) and
Section 47107(a) concerning airports, there are no enforcement
procedures for either provision and because private buses are not their
concern, both the Federal Transit Administration and the Federal
Aviation Administration have demonstrated either little to no interest
in ensuring their funding recipients comply with the law or,
alternatively, they claim the law provides them insufficient means to
take action. This has left bus operators with nowhere to turn for
assistance. To address:
Step 1. Provide for enforcement mechanisms under both the FTA and FAA
statutory provisions to address non-compliant grantees, and
establish a definition for ``reasonable'' in the FTA statute.
Ensure these changes are incorporated into agency guidance for
implementing the statutes.
a.  Statutory language should apply to recipients and
subrecipients, and in both urban and rural settings, to ensure states,
regions and localities and any other public authorities, are subject to
the provision.
b.  Ensure there is a process established for access requests,
providing procedures for both grant recipients/subrecipients and
operators, and include firm deadlines for responses.
c.  Non-compliance enforcement penalties should include denials of
access based on frivolous and discriminatory reasons. Also, it should
be clarified that intercity bus service is not an ``incidental'' use of
the facility.
d.  To ensure transparency and assist enforcement, requests for
access should be made public, along with a recipient's/subrecipient's
determination on whether to deny or grant such access.
e.  Conditions of access should not be unduly burdensome,
economically infeasible, or have a discriminatory effect.
f.  Pertinent federal agencies should have power to review access
determinations by recipients/subrecipients, and rectify improper
outcomes, including overruling denials and withholding of grant funds
from non-compliant recipients/subrecipients.
Step 2: Develop a similar provision and program for the passenger rail
statutory framework, to ensure application across the modes and
use of public facilities.
Similarly, bus operators are increasingly facing restrictions from
local jurisdictions they are trying to serve, in terms of pick-up/drop-
off points. Due to the changing business environment forcing the
closing of numerous bus stations, rural operators have sought to
relocate \2\; however, many localities are restricting or prohibiting
these efforts. For example, rather than working with bus operators and
the public to relocate to areas that are safe and provide amenities and
meaningful connections to other transportation services, localities are
instead restricting bus operations to areas with few amenities and no
intermodal access, such as industrial areas. There are also instances
where localities tried to prohibit stops at all within their
jurisdiction. These efforts result in less attractive bus service,
hurting the traveling public who relies on the service, the bus
operator, and the entire transportation network.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is entirely contradictory to longstanding Federal policy
intended to preserve rural intercity bus service. In 1991, ISTEA
established the 5311(f) program specifically to assist with maintaining
rural intercity service and ensure the sustainability of such service.
In 2004, Congress directed the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)
to study the problem of declining intercity bus service, including
rural bus service, and make recommendations, demonstrating a continuing
interest in preserving intercity bus service. However, as first
identified in the 2005 issued DOT report \3\ and through to today,
intercity bus service continues to decline, particularly rural bus
service despite federal efforts. Greyhound is again going through
restructuring and has exited various markets and sold or closed various
terminal facilities, seeking stable economic footing to remain
sustainable. This, in turn, has particularly affected rural bus
operators with the loss of facilities. Several of these regional bus
operators replaced services formerly provided by Greyhound; however,
with the loss of viable pick-up/drop-off locations, their services are
becoming even less economically feasible.

Service, report to Congress, July 2005. https://www.transportation.gov/

%20Report%20%20Final.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 5311 program has not kept pace with current realities and
localities are frustrating the effort. It is counterintuitive for
recipients of 5311 funding, funding intended to sustain rural
transportation services, including bus services, to turn around and
create obstacles to making such services economically viable.
The 5311(f) program needs to be updated to reflect current economic
circumstances facing the intercity bus industry if the program is to
remain effective.
Step 3: The 5311(f) program should be reviewed to assess its
effectiveness.
a.  The current 50% limit on federal operating subsidy under the
5311(f) program needs to be increased. Under the current program, no
more than 50% of a project cost or service can be covered by a federal
operating subsidy (e.g. 5311(f) funds), with the remainder required to
be covered by non-federal match, which most often means by the bus
operator. However, these projects or services generally run at a
deficit, making it economically unsustainable for the bus operator to
continue bearing the remaining 50% cost, particularly if it has no
other traffic feeding into it and/or the service is unattractive to
passenger travel. Bus operators providing these rural services simply
cannot survive under this model; at best, if they are able to break
even in terms of cost, which is unlikely, it is insufficient to sustain
an intercity bus business. The federal operating subsidy for supporting
rural service under 5311(f) needs to be increased if rural intercity
service is to remain viable.
b.  Increased capital subsidy matches for buses that must comply
with Buy America requirements. Currently, under 5311(f), the federal
subsidy for capital projects can be 80-85%, with the bus operator
covering the remaining 15-20%. However, Buy America compliant vehicles
are becoming too costly, with significant increases in recent years due
to a reduction in OEMs, supply chain issues and labor. If the Federal
Government requires Buy America compliant vehicles for use under the
program, it needs to increase the federal subsidy portion.
Alternatively, increased flexibility for granting waivers under the Buy
America program could be helpful.
c.  Consider establishment of a federal low-interest loan program
for the bus operator portion of vehicle purchases. Private financing
for vehicles is difficult to obtain because the Federal Government or
the State DOT puts a first lien on the vehicle, as opposed to private
purchases with financing, where the bank or financial institution
requires the first lien on the asset. In the case of capital
investments using 5311(f) funds, the intercity bus operator needs to
fund its portion of the transaction with cash or encumber other assets
to fund vehicles for public use.
Step 4. Reconsider several recommendations from the 2005 Study of
Intercity Bus Service. Specifically worth reconsidering:
a.  Increased funding for the 5311(f) program;
b.  Strengthen and add transparency to the 5311(f) certification
process;
c.  Fund and ensure access to intermodal passenger facilities,
ensure such infrastructure allows for bus ticket counters, proper bus
loading/unloading areas, access to amenities and common areas for bus
passengers;
d.  Rural feeder service/coordination;
e.  State, Regional AND local coordination;
f.  Integrated traveler information; and
g.  An ``Essential Transportation Services'' program.
Step 5. In addition to the recommendations outlined in the report,
there are several other steps that should be considered.
a.  Include stronger statutory language under 5311, in conjunction
with 5323(r), to limit any recipient or subrecipient of federal transit
funding from adopting measures, through zoning ordinances or otherwise,
that would prohibit access to federally funded transportation
facilities. Access to federal funding should be restricted if such
inappropriate actions are pursued.

Question 1.b. Are there policies that can be advanced that would
remedy the issue?
Answer. Policies already exist to support the sustainability of
rural intercity bus service and non-discriminatory practices, if they
are followed. As noted above, Congress has established strong policy in
support of intercity bus service and, for that matter, intermodal
transportation. However, a culture of competition between modes for
public funding and services has put the private bus industry at a
distinct disadvantage and the 5311(f) program requires increased
funding. Also, without mechanisms and incentive to ensure compliance
with current law in support of established federal policy goals to
support rural intercity bus service, efforts will continue to thwart
the policy goals. The ideas outlined above, provide a strong platform
for discussion in preparation for the next surface reauthorization, and
the industry would welcome the opportunity to work with the Committee
to improve efforts to meet the established policy goals for sustaining
the rural intercity bus industry.

Question 2. In late 2023, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
released its final rule to create a greenhouse gas performance measure,
forcing state departments of transportation and metropolitan planning
organizations to set declining targets for carbon dioxide emissions
associated with vehicles and travel along the National Highway System,
or as your drivers might describe it, their workplace.\4\ On March 27,
2024, the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Texas vacated the rule.\5\ Additionally, on April 1, 2024, the United
States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky issued an
opinion finding the rule exceeds FHWA's statutory authority and is
arbitrary and capricious.\6\ However, the Biden Administration has said
it is considering next steps as the legal process continues.\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2.a. Would implementation of the rule as finalized by FHWA
help or hurt transportation operations in small and rural communities
across the country?
Answer. Thank you for the question. The FHWA rule would not be
helpful to transportation operations in small and rural communities.
Rural states have very different transportation needs than states with
large urban regions, just as western states have very different needs
from eastern states, and so on. One of the hallmark principles of the
federal surface transportation program is to ensure federal funding,
collected through gas taxes, is returned to the states for making
transportation investments that best meet their needs--recognizing
local discretion is paramount, because local authorities are in the
best position to know their needs and how best to address them. The
FHWA rule flies in the face of this principle by restricting state and
local decision making.
By implementing the rule, states and small and rural communities
will put much needed federal transportation funding at risk if they
choose projects to meet local needs but may not comply with the
Administration's policy goals. The rule directly targets roadway
vehicles and roadway capacity, the most relied upon form of
transportation for small and rural communities whose transportation
choices are often limited. The purpose of the rule, like other non-FHWA
Administration policy initiatives, is to tackle climate change by
limiting emissions from roadway vehicles through promotion of
investment in alternative, ``emissions reducing'' transportation
projects, such as public transit, streetscaping or bike lanes. However,
the transportation needs of small and rural communities are not always
suited to these alternative projects, and in some cases such
alternatives could instead further contribute to emissions and other
harmful outcomes, as well as waste scarce federal resources.

Question 2.b. Does a Federally mandated one-size-fits-all approach
to this issue work in Iowa, where Windstar is based, or in many of the
surrounding rural states where you run routes?
Answer. Windstar is very troubled by the Federal Government's
approach imposing a broad mandate on all states and territories without
providing the necessary flexibility for states and local planning
organizations to independently make decisions that best meet their
needs. The Federally mandated policy is clearly intended to force
states and rural communities to make decisions about critical
transportation funding against their interests or risk losing access to
federal funding.
For example, Highway 30 runs from the east to west borders of Iowa,
and is one of the most traveled roadways in the state, connecting major
cities such as Cedar Rapids and Ames, serving over 550,000 of Iowa's
3.1 million population. However, over 80 miles of it remains two-lane,
which causes safety concerns, congestion, and operational
inefficiencies for businesses like Windstar. Highway 30 needs to be
modernized, including increasing its capacity to make it a 4-lane
highway. However, the FHWA rule would discourage Iowa from considering
this type of project because it involves increasing highway capacity.
Instead, the FHWA rule would encourage Iowa to consider alternative
actions, such as adding more transit or bike lanes, to comply with
efforts to reach declining GHG targets. This outcome would do nothing
to address the Highway 30 safety and congestion related concerns and
may even exacerbate them. Alternatively, if Iowa determined to pursue
the Highway 30 project and/or could not find suitable other emissions
reducing alternatives, even though the rule refrains from imposing
explicit penalties for missing GHG targets, the state risks losing out
on future federal funding opportunities for being noncompliant.
States with vast open ranges and numerous rural communities
dependent on surface infrastructure and vehicles are put at a distinct
disadvantage under the FHWA rule. The rule's ``one-size-fits-all''
approach makes no provision for the varying and unique transportation
challenges facing the varied regions of this nation, the fundamental
reason why the federal highway program was intentionally designed to
leave investment decisions in the hands of local experts. Windstar and
the bus industry do not support the FHWA rule.

Question 3. The Biden Administration has devoted significant effort
and funding towards incentivizing a transition of the transportation
sector to electric vehicles (EVs), including within the bus
industry.\8\ How do electric buses compare to traditionally fueled
buses in terms of range, reliability, and production and maintenance
costs?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. Thank you for the question. Windstar is very concerned
about the increasing regulatory and policy pressures, not incentives,
to transition the heavy-duty vehicle industry to zero-emission
vehicles, including over-the-road buses. Although we certainly support
the need to address climate change concerns, we are frustrated that our
industry is not recognized for being one of the ``greenest'' modes of
transportation currently operating. Buses remove cars from the road,
with some motorcoaches accommodating 57 passengers. Our engines are
clean, producing the least amount of carbon emissions per passenger and
using less fuel per passenger mile than all other modes of
transportation. Our engines use ultra-low sulfur diesel fuels, as
mandated by federal rules, and are equipped with particulate filters
that capture 98% of particles in diesel exhaust, with the lowest
particulate matter emission rate among all on-road transportation
modes. Yet, in policy discussions and regulatory proceedings, rarely
are these contributions to reducing the transportation industry's
carbon footprint taken into account. As part of the heavy-duty (HD)
transportation sector, motorcoach operators, along with other heavy-
duty commercial motor vehicles operators, are under intense pressure to
transition to zero-emissions vehicles or ZEVs.
Candidly, ZEV transition is just not possible for our industry at
this time, for a number of reasons. First, the ZEV technology for HD
vehicles is still under development, with no clear path forward on
whether electric powered buses or BEVs, or hydrogen fuel cell powered
buses or some other technology will prevail.
Although BEV vehicles are in use in limited settings today, they
cannot provide a 1:1 replacement for diesel powered internal combustion
engine (ICE) motorcoaches. The nominal range for a BEV, which is likely
greater than actual operating range, is 150-300 miles, depending on
battery size, compared to +/- 1500 miles for an ICE powered motorcoach.
However, once actual operating conditions are factored in, such as a
20%+/- loss in range (only 80% of the battery is generally available
for use, as battery life is severely shortened by repeated charging to
100%), temperatures/climate, geography, auxiliary loads (e.g. heating/
AC, ventilation etc.), and other factors, the actual operating range is
lower, realistically in the range of 150-200 miles. There are tradeoffs
for consideration, where range could be extended; however, this would
involve using larger batteries that would require increased space to
house the battery pack, longer ``refueling'' time and less space for
money-generating passenger capacity. Also, from what we are seeing in
the real-world deployment of BEVs in the transit arena, BEVs are simply
not as reliable as an ICE vehicle for service--particularly in more
extreme climates--there are weight issues and durability issues, with
more breakdowns and longer shop times than expected \9\. Simply put,
BEVs are not a one for one replacement for diesel ICE buses.

Still Right to be Cautious, April 25, 2003. https://transitcenter.org/
electric-buses-are-the-future-agencies-are-still-right-to-be-cautious/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recharging time to ``refuel'' a BEV is also an issue, particularly
with a shortened vehicle range. Currently, it takes about 3-4 hours to
recharge a BEV, depending on battery size, as opposed to 20-30 minutes
to refuel an ICE vehicle. This time cost is entirely unrealistic for
long distance passenger travel. Additionally, the charging
infrastructure to support commercial motorcoach travel does not yet
exist and will require significant investment.\10\ (See study) Although
the Administration is heavily investing in charging infrastructure
buildout, there remain a number of challenges that will take time to
overcome. BEVs require enroute charging infrastructure that will be
sufficient to charge HD engines and provide adequate space to
accommodate large vehicles. To date, investment in charging
infrastructure has focused primarily on personal vehicles, with no
thought to the space needs or standards to ensure sufficient charging
capacity. Charging capacity for HD vehicles requires costly utility
service upgrades to support high-capacity chargers. This type of
buildout for HD electric vehicles will not be a short-term undertaking,
it will require time and sufficient power supply.

The alternative technology of hydrogen powered fuel-cells shows
promise because this technology offers longer driving ranges, shorter
fueling times, and space efficiencies in terms of vehicle housing for
the fuel cell technology. However, there are no bus OEMs producing
hydrogen fuel cell buses currently for use in the U.S. Also, hydrogen
fuel is in limited supply, costly to produce and not as efficient
(having to be converted to provide electricity, affecting its
efficiency), thus it is likely to be a costly fuel source to use and
maintain. Hydrogen fueling stations and site locations are dependent on
how hydrogen is produced, delivered and stored on site, and require a
sizeable footprint. Due to these challenges, hydrogen fueling
infrastructure at this point in the U.S. is even less accessible than
charging infrastructure, with almost all sites located in
California.\11\ As well, there are also safety considerations to take
into account in using hydrogen, with many of the standards and best
practices in the current use of hydrogen adapted from other industries
and not yet updated to apply to use of hydrogen for surface
transportation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, there are significant costs involved for bus operators
with transitioning to HD ZEVS, either battery-powered or hydrogen fuel
cell-powered. In terms of vehicles, the current cost of a BEV is around
$1.2 million in comparison to the $600,000 cost of an ICE motorcoach,
and the price is even higher for a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, up to $2
million (based on transit buses, as motorcoaches are not even available
in the U.S.) In addition to vehicle costs, there are additional costs
required to invest in on-site fueling infrastructure, including both
financial costs and time costs to obtain permits and coordinating with
power suppliers. This is not a simple undertaking for an industry
dominated by small, family-owned businesses. Also, drivers and
maintenance staff will need training to work with and maintain the new
vehicles and technology, and our industry is already in the midst of a
driver and mechanic shortage.
These are extremely complex and heavy economic burdens for the
private motorcoach industry as a whole, and pose a serious threat to an
already struggling rural intercity bus network. Further, although the
Federal Government has prioritized transitioning the HD vehicle
industry to ZEVs and provided sizable subsidies to support the
transition, including significant grant funding to the public transit
industry which is often a direct competitor of private bus operators,
it has not provided funding assistance to help the private bus
industry. There are no incentives, instead, federal rules and, by
default, California Air Resource Board rules continue to press on bus
manufacturers and bus operators. These actions will force bus operators
to make timely choices between investing in clean, reliable technology
that will provide cost recovery: or costly, nascent technology still
under development, which may not provide a return on investment and
could induce financial hardship.

Question 4. Windstar buses traverse across many parts of this
country, and specifically many rural regions. Does the charging
infrastructure exist to make long range electric bus travel feasible
for costs or travel schedules?
Answer. Currently, Windstar is not operating any electric buses or
BEVs, and the lack of infrastructure is just one of many reasons why we
have not pursued investing in these vehicles. However, based on
information shared by bus OEMs and other bus operators using electric
vehicles, the infrastructure is not in place to support commercial BEV
operations.
Most existing charging infrastructure was designed and built to
support personal vehicle operations. These facilities often cannot
accommodate large vehicles, and the charging equipment--when it is
working--is not high-capacity charging equipment to fast charge HD
vehicles. Further, there are insufficient charging stations available
to support long distance bus travel, and what is available rarely
provides sufficient amenities to support bus passengers. At this time,
there is very little incentive for private bus operators to pursue or
invest in electric buses if their operations involve distance travel.
Another concern is simply the space requirements within the vehicle for
the battery package. The amount of space needed requires removal of the
majority of space currently reserved for passenger luggage. Long
distance travel requires a significant amount of space for customer
luggage. With electric buses, the current luggage space is now filled
with large batteries, leaving no space available to accommodate luggage
for 56 passengers. Simply put, the technology is not there yet for
over-the-road motorcoach companies to operate electric buses given the
current battery capacity and size requirements, along with range
limitations and the lack of charging infrastructure along the route.
Together with the significant cost investment required for these
vehicles, the industry is hard pressed to consider transitioning to
BEVs at this time.
