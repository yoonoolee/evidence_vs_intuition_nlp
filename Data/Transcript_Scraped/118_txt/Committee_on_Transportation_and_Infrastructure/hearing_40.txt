SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Water Resources and
Environment
FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Water Resources and
Environment
RE:      LSubcommittee Hearing on ``Proposals for a Water
Resources Development Act of 2024: Stakeholder Priorities''
_______________________________________________________________________

I. PURPOSE

The Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment of the
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will meet on
Wednesday, December 13, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. ET in 2167 Rayburn
House Office Building to receive testimony at a hearing
entitled, ``Proposals for a Water Resources Development Act of
2024: Stakeholder Priorities.'' The hearing will allow Members
to receive testimony from water resources stakeholders, such as
local officials, levee district managers, and others to discuss
priorities related to the civil works responsibilities of the
United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) for a Water
Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2024.

II. BACKGROUND

THE UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS_CIVIL WORKS

The mission of the Corps is to ``deliver vital engineering
solutions, in collaboration with [their] partners, to secure
our Nation, energize our economy, and reduce disaster risk.''
\1\ The Corps is the Federal Government's lead water resource
development and management agency.\2\ Its water resource
program dates back to 1824 when it was established for the
purpose of improving river navigation.\3\ The role of the Corps
has evolved and expanded since then to include other main water
resource responsibilities.

\3\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today, the Corps' primary civil works responsibilities are
to support coastal and river navigation, address flood risk
management and storm damage, and protect and restore aquatic
ecosystems.\4\ Specifically, through its eight divisions and 38
district offices, the Corps manages 14,000 miles of levees, 740
dams, 12,000 miles of inland intracoastal waterways, 218 lock
chambers, and 13,000 miles of navigation channels.\5\

Nation/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Corps also provides outdoor recreation opportunities,
offers water supply storage to state and local partners,
assists in emergency response, and is a leading producer of
hydropower in the United States.\6\ In fact, the Corps is the
largest owner-operator of hydroelectric power plants in the
United States, which produce approximately 25 percent of the
Nation's total hydropower output.\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Corps' infrastructure portfolio is currently valued at
$206 billion.\8\ This valuation is referred to as its ``capital
stock'' and includes all water resources infrastructure built
by the Corps since 1928.\9\ The estimated capital stock value
increased $6.6 billion on average each year until 1982, when it
peaked at $357 billion.\10\ The Corps has reported that
deterioration, general wear and tear of infrastructure assets,
and asset retirements have contributed to a decline in the
value of the capital stock.\11\ Furthermore, the Corps has a
construction backlog exceeding $100 billion, in addition to
various authorized but unfunded studies and operation and
maintenance activities.\12\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To achieve its civil works mission, the Corps plans,
designs, and constructs water resources development projects,
typically in partnership with, and utilizing the financial
support of, non-Federal interests, commonly referred to as
project sponsors. The Corps' planning process seeks to balance
economic development and environmental considerations as it
addresses National, regional, and local water resources issues.

WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACTS

Congress generally authorizes Corps' studies, projects, and
programs and makes changes to agency policies through
legislation referred to as Water Resources Development Acts
(WRDAs). Congress has developed and enacted WRDAs
intermittently since the 1980s and has biennially enacted a
WRDA since 2014.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authorizing provisions in WRDAs can be project-specific,
programmatic, or general directives for the Corps. Project-
specific authorizations most often fall into one of three broad
categories: project studies, construction projects, or
modifications to existing projects. Furthermore, water resource
projects typically require two types of Congressional
authorization: (1) authority to study the feasibility of the
project and (2) authority to construct (and operate and
maintain, as applicable) the project.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\14\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

IDENTIFYING WATER RESOURCE NEEDS

Generally, the first step in developing a project through
the Corps is to study the feasibility of the proposed project,
which typically requires Congressional authorization. Once
authorized, the Corps enters into a cost-sharing agreement with
a non-Federal project sponsor to initiate the feasibility study
process. The cost of a feasibility study is usually split
evenly between the Federal Government--which is subject to
appropriations--and the non-Federal project sponsor.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\15\ CRS Report IF113322, supra note 4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since February 2012, the Corps' feasibility studies have
been guided by the ``3x3x3 rule,'' which states that
feasibility reports should, generally, be produced within three
years; with a Federal cost of no more than $3 million; and
involve all three levels of Corps review--district, division,
and headquarters--throughout the study process.\16\ This
concept, enacted as section 1001 of the Water Resources Reform
and Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014, also allows for a waiver
of the 3x3x3 process for project studies determined to be
complex based on size, scope, or significance.\17\

SmartFeasibility_Guide_highres.pdf.
\17\ 33 U.S.C. 2282c.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the feasibility study phase, the Corps' district
office prepares a draft study report containing a detailed
analysis on the economic costs and benefits of carrying out the
project and identifies any associated environmental, social, or
cultural impacts. The feasibility study typically describes,
with reasonable certainty, the economic, social, and
environmental benefits and detriments of each project
alternatives being considered, and identifies the engineering
features, public acceptability, and the purposes, scope, and
scale of each.\18\ It also contains the views of other Federal
and non-Federal agencies on project alternatives, a description
of non-structural alternatives to the recommended plans, and a
description of the anticipated Federal and non-Federal
participation in the project.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\18\ Id.
\19\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
After a full feasibility study is completed, the results
and recommendations of the study are submitted to Congress in
the form of a Report of the United States Army Corps of
Engineers Chief of Engineers (more commonly referred to as a
Chief's Report).\20\ If the results and recommendations on the
proposed project are favorable, then the next step is
Congressional authorization for construction of the project,
which is typically given in a WRDA.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADDITIONAL CORPS AUTHORITIES

Congress has granted the Corps programmatic authorities--
Continuing Authorities Programs (CAPs)--that enable the Corps
to undertake small-scale projects with limited scope and cost
without requiring project-specific Congressional
authorization.\21\ These projects typically require a cost-
share with a non-Federal project sponsor.\22\

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID ROUZER OF NORTH CAROLINA,
CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON WATER RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT

Mr. Rouzer. Today's hearing marks the second in a series of
hearings this subcommittee is holding in preparation for the
Water Resources Development Act of 2024. This past week, we
heard from Assistant Secretary Connor and General Spellmon
regarding the administration's priorities for WRDA 2024. Today,
we have the opportunity to hear from stakeholders from across
the Nation who will testify to the importance of Army Corps
Civil Works programs and maintaining a consistent 2-year WRDA
schedule.
WRDA is one of the most important pieces of legislation we
work to draft and pass here in the Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee, and we are proud to do so regularly.
Every 2 years since 2014, Congress has passed a bipartisan,
consensus WRDA bill into law, helping communities across the
country. I look forward to working once again with my
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue the important
work and tradition of passing this bill every 2 years.
As I mentioned at last week's hearing, WRDA is a critical
legislative vehicle to meet the water resources needs in our
communities nationwide. Reliable water navigation systems allow
for the safe and efficient shipping of cargo, fueling our
economy. Levees protect homes and businesses from flooding.
Dams also provide flood control for communities, along with
power and opportunities for recreation. Of particular
importance to my constituents on the coast in North Carolina's
Seventh Congressional District, coastal restoration and
nourishment projects mitigate erosion and damage from frequent
coastal storms.
WRDA 2020 reauthorized the coastal storm risk management
projects in Wrightsville Beach and Carolina Beach, allowing
these to continue to receive renourishment. As sand naturally
shifts over time, these coastal communities rely on a
predictable renourishment cycle to ensure they can withstand
storms. WRDA 2022 also provided authorization for investment in
other erosion mitigation efforts, such as the shoreline and
riverine restoration in Southport, North Carolina, which will
bolster the riverbank's resilience against damage from storms
and vessel traffic.
To enhance flood mitigation efforts, it is important to
have a clear understanding of the need. As such, the 2022 WRDA
also authorized the national coastal mapping program in North
Carolina, which will map inland and coastal waterways to
identify factors that increase flood risk. I was pleased to see
funding included in the 2024 Energy and Water Appropriations
bill--that is, if we ever have an appropriations package that
passes Congress and gets signed into law. Let's hope that we
do.
Mrs. Napolitano. We will.
Mr. Rouzer. My ranking member says we will, so, I take her
word on it.
I was also pleased to continue support of the Wilmington
Harbor deepening project, as authorized in WRDA 2020, to allow
the Port of Wilmington to meet increasing demand.
All of these efforts are critical parts of keeping
Americans safe and allowing our Nation's economy to thrive,
which is exactly what this legislation enables.
An important part of the WRDA process is the partnership
between the Federal Government, non-Federal partners, and
stakeholders, who come together to solve local resource needs.
So, I am glad to see today that we have a panel of witnesses
made up of diverse interests and geographic areas. This panel
can speak to water resource challenges as well as to solutions
that these WRDAs can provide.
We look forward to hearing from each of you here today on
the importance of this legislation in assisting with flood
control, inland waterway navigation, coastal restoration, beach
renourishment, and ensuring the safe movement of goods through
maritime transportation.
I would like to extend a very warm welcome to each of you
but, in particular, to a friend and constituent of mine, Mayor
Teresa Batts of Surf City, North Carolina, with whom my staff
and I have done a tremendous amount of work through the years
as it relates to the needs of Surf City and the coastal area
there.
[Mr. Rouzer's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. David Rouzer, a Representative in Congress
from the State of North Carolina, and Chairman, Subcommittee on Water

cargo, fueling our economy. Levees protect homes and businesses from
flooding. Dams also provide flood control for communities, along with
power and opportunities for recreation. Finally, of particular
importance to my constituents up and down the coast in North Carolina's
Seventh District, coastal restoration and nourishment projects mitigate
erosion and damage from frequent coastal storms.
WRDA 2020 reauthorized the Coastal Storm Risk Management projects
in Wrightsville Beach and Carolina Beach allowing these beaches to
continue to receive renourishment. As sand naturally drifts away with
the current over time, these coastal communities rely on a predictable
renourishment cycle to ensure they are not at unmanageable risk when
storms come. WRDA 2022 provided authorization for investment in other
erosion mitigation efforts, such as the Shoreline and Riverine
Restoration in Southport, North Carolina, which will bolster the
river's resilience against damage from storms and vessel traffic.
However, the best way to combat erosion and enhance mitigation
efforts is to have a clear understanding of our coasts. To support this
effort, the last WRDA also authorized the National Coastal Mapping
Program in North Carolina which will map inland and coastal waterways
to identify factors which increase flood risk. I was pleased to see
this project addressed in the 2024 Energy and Water Appropriations
bill. I was also pleased to continue support of the Wilmington Harbor
deepening project as authorized in WRDA 2020 to allow the Port of
Wilmington to meet increasing demand. All of these efforts are critical
parts of keeping Americans safe and allowing our nation's economy to
thrive, which is exactly what WRDA does.
An important part of the WRDA process is the partnership between
the federal government, non-federal partners, and stakeholders, who
come together to solve local water resources needs. I am glad to see
today that we have a panel of witnesses made up of diverse interests
and geographic areas, but who are brought together not only by water
resources issues, but also by solutions that WRDAs can provide.
I look forward to hearing from each of you here today on the
importance of WRDA in assisting with flood control, inland waterway
navigation, coastal restoration, beach renourishment, and ensuring safe
movement of goods through maritime transportation.
Particularly, I would like to extend a warm welcome to a friend and
constituent of mine, Mayor Teresa Batts of Surf City, North Carolina,
with whom I have been able to work through the WRDA process to secure
an important beach nourishment project upon approval from the office of
the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.

Mr. Rouzer. With that, I yield back and recognize my
ranking member, Mrs. Napolitano, for 5 minutes for an opening
statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO OF CALIFORNIA,
RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON WATER RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT

Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, my great friend, Chairman
Rouzer, for holding today's meeting.
Through the biennial enactment of the Water Resources
Development Act, WRDA, this committee is addressing the water-
related needs of our States and local communities. WRDAs are a
shining example of how Congress can efficiently and effectively
meet the bipartisan needs of our communities when we decide it
is best to work together than apart.
Again, I look forward to continuing my relationship and
partnership with you, Mr. Chairman, Chairman Graves, and
Ranking Member Larsen, to get it done.
Mr. Chairman, each of our communities experience unique
water resources challenges. We seek to address these challenges
through predictable enactment of WRDA, providing the Corps with
the tools and funding necessary to address community needs.
As stressors or local priorities change over time, this
committee has stayed vigilant to ensure that the Corps has the
authority and resources necessary to address local needs.
The history of the Corps bears this out. The Corps' Civil
Works responsibility was initially focused primarily on
navigation, developing the coastal and inland harbors necessary
for the efficient movement of goods to our then young, great
Nation.
That responsibility was later expanded to incorporate
large-scale flood control, in part due to widespread flooding
along the Mississippi River that devastated communities and
livelihoods.
More recently, as more and more communities have come to
realize the economic, environmental, and public health benefits
from restoring their environment, Congress expanded the Corps'
responsibility to include watershed and ecosystem restoration--
benefits that can be seen in the Florida Everglades, coastal
Louisiana, and the Great Lakes.
Mr. Chairman, we have reached another one of those critical
decision points, this time related to the Corps' role in
addressing water supply and water conservation needs of the
Nation. Communities across the country are now facing similar
water supply and water conservation challenges that we have
long felt in the West. Cities and towns are coming to recognize
the importance of water security for the health of their
municipalities, their industry, their agriculture, and their
economies.
Over the past decade, I have championed several provisions
to enhance the authority and flexibility of the Corps to
address local water supply and water conservation needs while
balancing these efforts with the other authorized purposes of
the Corps.
Yet, despite these legislative efforts, the Corps and the
Office of Management and Budget continue to believe that water
supply and water conservation are not a primary mission of the
Corps, meaning that these objectives do not get the same
attention and budgetary priority as the three other mission
areas.
Therefore, it is prudent that we rethink the Corps' role in
helping communities face water insecurity--not to supplant the
State and local efforts, but to support them.
For months, staff and I have been working with stakeholders
and Members of Congress to elevate the water supply and water
conservation mission of the Corps. My draft proposal, the,
quote, ``Priority for Water Supply and Conservation Act,''
close quote, which I ask unanimous consent to include as part
of today's hearing record----
Mr. Rouzer [interposing]. Without objection.
Mrs. Napolitano [continuing]. Would direct the Corps to
give equal budgetary and policy priority to water supply and
water conservation elements of Corps' projects that are
authorized by Congress.

2023, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Grace F. Napolitano

Fact Sheet, Priority for Water Supply and Conservation Act, Submitted

[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

H.R. ___ the Priority for Water Supply and Conservation Act
Introduced by Congresswoman Grace F. Napolitano (D-CA)
Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment
Water is essential for life and critical to the well-being of both
humans and ecological systems. Water is an essential input into
virtually all economic activity--contributing to the success of
industry, manufacturing, agriculture, hydroelectricity, transportation,
and recreation. Both our way and quality of life depends, to a great
extent, on a reliable and sustainable water supply systems, including
efforts to conserve and reuse water whenever possible.
Congress provided the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), the
nation's largest water resources management agency, with a major role
in assuring the nation's water supply.
The Corps assists States and local interests in providing Americans
with enough water to meet their needs--primarily by providing storage
space for water supply in multi-purpose Corps' reservoirs. The Corps
also plays a critical role in providing sustainable sources of water to
meet the nation's agricultural needs.
[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

As recent history has shown, the water needs of society are
increasing and becoming more diverse. Today, communities are challenged
in balancing competing water supply uses along with the pressures of
growing populations, aging infrastructure, ecosystem protection, and
climate change, including persistent drought conditions. Water security
is becoming increasingly important to the water resources needs of the
Nation, requiring a rethinking of the historic priorities and missions
of the Corps.
For decades, water supply has been given less prominence than other
infrastructure responsibilities of the Corps, such as its current
primary missions for navigation, flood control, and ecosystem/
environmental restoration. Water supply, including water conservation,
are increasingly important national priorities that should be elevated
in federal public policy discussions and must be given equal priority
in the national discussion on the role, purpose, and value of Corps'
water resources development infrastructure.
What H.R. ___ the Priority for Water Supply and Conservation Act WOULD
do:
H.R. ___ would elevate water supply and water conservation to
primary mission areas of the Corps to further encourage a heightened
public focus on the challenges in meeting the competing water resources
needs of the nation.
H.R. ___ would authorize the Corps to give equal priority to water
resources development measures for increased and sustainable sources of
water supply, including:

efforts to revise antiquated water control manuals at
existing Corps' water resources development projects to maximize the
opportunities water supply and water conservation when not inconsistent
with other authorized project purposes;

measures to remove sediment at existing Corps' reservoir
projects to maximize water supply storage capacity of existing
facilities;

measures to ensure sustainable clean water for the
protection and restoration of the environment and natural habitat;

the investigation of opportunities to increase or add
water supply storage at existing Corps' water resources development
projects;

measures to promote the use of innovative technologies
and practices, such as forecast informed reservoir operations (FIRO)
and managed aquifer recovery (MAR), to maximize the availability of
water supply opportunities;

the development of drought contingency plans for
communities served by Corps' water supply projects to help address
sustainable local water needs; and

measures to promote water conservation and water reuse
practices at existing water resources development projects to maximize
the utilization of existing water supplies.
What H.R. ___ the Priority for Water Supply and Conservation Act WOULD
NOT do:
H.R. ___ does not affect existing national policy that recognizes
that States and local interests have primary responsibilities in
developing water supplies for domestic, municipal, industrial, and
other purposes.
H.R. ___ does not contemplate the construction of new, major
surface infrastructure by the Corps for water storage.
H.R. ___ does not affect the Corps' existing legal requirements to
enter into agreements with States, municipalities, or other supply
users, such as the Water Supply Act of 1958.

Mrs. Napolitano. To be clear, my proposal does not
automatically add water supply or water conservation to the
existing projects, nor would it put a finger on the scale to
prioritize water supply or water conservation over other
existing, authorized project purposes. Nor would it affect
existing national policy that recognizes that the State and
local interests have primary responsibilities in developing
local water supplies.
My proposal simply eliminates any artificial barriers being
used by the Corps or OMB to exclude from consideration worthy
water supply and conservation projects authorized by Congress
that also have substantial State and local support.
Mr. Chairman, as we develop a new WRDA bill for 2024, that
legislation should recognize the increased role the Corps is
playing and will continue playing in addressing the municipal,
industrial, and agricultural water needs of our communities and
constituents.
I look forward to working with you on this proposal and on
our continued partnership to develop another successful WRDA
this Congress. So, let's get to work, and I yield back.
[Mrs. Napolitano's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Grace F. Napolitano, a Representative in

and Political Affairs, Associated Builders and Contractors, Submitted

U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Subcommittee
on Water Resources and Environment, 2165 Rayburn House Office
Building, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Grace Napolitano,
Ranking Member,
U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Subcommittee
on Water Resources and Environment, 2165 Rayburn House Office
Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano and Members of the U.S.
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on
Water Resources and Environment:
On behalf of Associated Builders and Contractors, a national
construction industry trade association with 68 chapters representing
more than 23,000 member companies, we thank you for holding the
hearing, ``Proposals for a Water Resources Development Act of 2024:
Stakeholder Priorities.''
ABC believes that the WRDA 2024 bill represents an opportunity to
deliver a bipartisan infrastructure bill with constructive feedback
from nonfederal partners and other stakeholders. ABC urges the
committee to continue the tradition of keeping anti-competitive
procurement provisions out of the final WRDA product's legislative
language.
ABC appreciates the opportunity to comment on the committee's
important work to improve our nation's water infrastructure and share
our priorities, as ABC and our members are committed to building
taxpayer-funded projects with the highest standards of safety and
quality.
ABC urges the committee to ensure that all contracts awarded from
funds of the legislation are granted through a fair and competitive
bidding process that allows all qualified contractors to compete on a
level playing field based on merit, experience, quality and safety.
The committee should be aware that WRDA projects could be effected
by President Biden's Feb. 4, 2022, Executive Order 14063 [https://
www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/02/09/2022-02869/use-of-project-
labor-agreements-for-federal-construction-projects], which requires
PLAs on federal contracts of $35 million or more. Once final, the Biden
proposal will replace President Obama's Feb. 2, 2009, Executive Order
13502, which encourages federal agencies to mandate PLAs on large-scale
federal construction projects exceeding $25 million in total value on a
case-by-case basis, and permits states and localities to mandate PLAs
on federally assisted projects. ABC estimates the final Biden proposal
will affect as many as 120 federal contracts valued at $10 billion,
which is approximately 40% of the value of federal construction put in
place on an annual basis.
To deliver the highest quality projects at the best cost to
taxpayers, a critical part of any federal investment in infrastructure
should include the entire construction industry. The most cost-
effective way to rebuild infrastructure is to promote open competition.
ABC urges the committee to ensure that WRDA 2024 is free from any
government mandated PLAs.
Further, while ABC supports increased financing of water
infrastructure projects, we are concerned that these funds would apply
the recently rewritten [https://www.abc.org/DavisBacon] federal Davis-
Bacon Act requirements to federal and nonfederally funded projects,
decreasing the value to taxpayers. The committee should consider
opposing the more than 50 significant changes and urge the U.S.
Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division to withdraw the final
rule. Additionally, the committee should study the flawed and
inflationary wage determination process' effects on WRDA projects,
including the impact on competition, increase in the cost of
construction, and the effect on the number projects funded.
ABC members stand ready for the opportunity to build and maintain
America's water infrastructure to the benefit of the communities that
it will serve.
Thank you for your consideration of ABC's concerns.
Sincerely,
Kristen Swearingen,
Vice President, Legislative and Political Affairs,
Associated Builders and Contractors.

Dear Chairmen Carper and Graves and Ranking Members Moore Capito
and Larsen:
The undersigned organizations applaud the provisions in the
bipartisan Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) that focus on the
health of our nation's ports and waterways and request that this
legislation ensures that needed modifications are made to keep U.S.
waterways operating safely, efficiently, and competitively in the
global marketplace.
The U.S. maritime infrastructure system acts as a critical link in
the American economy. In 2022, the U.S. maritime transportation
system--consisting of harbors, ports, channels, locks, dams, and
waterways--delivered over $2.3 trillion worth of imports and
exports.\1\ The U.S. coastal port and inland waterway system together
support over 2.5 million jobs associated with the shipping industry.\2\
\3\ Many commodity markets rely on waterborne commerce including farm
and livestock products, raw materials and minerals, coal, iron ore,
chemicals, petroleum and petroleum products, and consumer goods. The
coastal port and inland waterway system support an additional 28
million jobs in these and related industries. With many U.S. jobs and
markets dependent upon U.S. waterways and infrastructure, a healthy and
reliable maritime system is more important than ever in keeping
domestically produced goods and markets competitive.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The U.S. maritime infrastructure system is in critical condition,
and geopolitical and national security events have created increased
demand for U.S. commodities and energy exports, resulting in pressures
on the system not seen in decades. U.S. international and domestic
trade is expected to continue increasing while global trade volume,
shipping distances, and vessels expand to maximize cost efficiency.
While the reliance on the maritime system grows, the existing
infrastructure is aging with the average age of locks in the United
States now exceeding 50 years. As a result of aging infrastructure,
traffic delays, frequent congestion and added costs are common events
for waterway users.
To address these challenges, the Water Resources Development Act of
2024 must include provisions to facilitate maintaining the future
efficient and effective construction and maintenance of important
maritime projects. In addition, provisions must ensure waterway usage
is safe, secure, and affordable. WRDA 2024 must take into consideration
the following:

Inland waterways construction and major rehabilitation
projects funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)
remain at federal cost. The 11,000 miles of fuel-taxed navigable
waterways are a crucial component of our nation's agriculture, energy,
and manufacturing supply chains. Despite facilitating the transport of
one-third of the nation's Gross Domestic Product, the system relies on
a network of lock and dam infrastructure that was constructed in the
early 20th century, far exceeding its original 50-year design life.
Deterioration has made these projects more susceptible to failures that
result in unscheduled closures or stoppages. These delays increase
congestion and the cost of transporting waterborne commodities,
compounding the recent effects of inflation on consumers. Necessary
capital improvements to the inland waterways transportation system are
cost-shared through a 29-cent-per-gallon fuel tax imposed on commercial
users of the system, and these taxes are deposited into the Inland
Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) to help with recapitalization of the
system. The current cost-share requirement is 35% from the IWTF, with
the remaining 65% from General Treasury funds, both appropriated to the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (The Corps) in an Energy and Water
Development appropriations bill. In providing Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act (IIJA) funds to The Corps, Congress waived the cost-share
requirement for inland waterways construction and major rehabilitation
projects, recognizing the importance of accelerating the pace to
complete projects in order to strengthen America's supply chain and
stay competitive in global markets. The IIJA funded seven inland
waterways construction projects, but due to significant cost overruns,
IIJA funds will be unable to complete any of these projects that were
originally considered funded to completion. Unless modified in WRDA
2024, this will jeopardize and needlessly delay critical ongoing and
planned capital improvements across the antiquated inland waterways
transportation system, further delaying the economic and environmental
benefits to the Nation.

+  Consistent with Congressional intent, the undersigned
organizations request that all inland waterways construction and major
rehabilitation projects funded by the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act (IIJA) remain at federal cost. This is consistent with the
intent that IIJA-funded inland waterways construction projects are
completed at 100% federal cost to achieve an accelerated return on
investment. Ensuring the cost of these projects remains 100% federally
funded will allow the nation to realize economic return more quickly,
reduce the supply chain's environmental footprint, address uncertainty
in global agriculture and energy markets, and is consistent with
Congressional intent.

Reauthorization of the National Dam Safety Program and
needed reforms to the High Hazard Potential Dam Rehabilitation Program.
These two programs serve as the backbone of federal efforts to ensure
the safety and resilience of the nation's dams. Congress has
demonstrated its willingness to support these programs through needed
investments in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), and
must continue to build on these investments to improve dam safety and
protect downstream communities. We ask that WRDA 2024 include:
a.  A five-year reauthorization of the National Dam Safety
Program, ensuring that program can continue to support state-level
programs through 2028.
b.  The removal of unnecessary limitations in the existing law
prohibiting states from receiving State Assistance Grant funding
totaling more than 50% of the cost of implementing state dam safety
programs. States are already required to make reasonable effort to fund
their own programs, and removing this limitation will allow for annual
appropriations and IIJA funds to flow more freely to states.
c.  A new definition of ``small underserved community'' for the
High Hazard Potential Dam Rehabilitation Program, and waiving the 35%
non-federal cost share requirements for grant eligible communities that
fall under this definition.
d.  Ensure that operation and maintenance responsibility or high
hazard potential dam projects falls on dam owners and not smaller grant
subrecipients.
e.  Language requiring an update from The Corps on efforts to
implement the National Low Head Dam Inventory, which was authorized in
WRDA 2022.
f.  Creation of a program dedicated to financing stormwater
infrastructure projects.

Necessary adjustments to Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund.
We ask that WRDA 2024 include dedicated funding of the Harbor
Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) to make certain that ports and channels
are maintained at their full depth and width to accommodate a variety
of commerce and waterway traffic. We also request that the bill include
language to maintain a new program, without affecting existing HMTF
funding allocations, for a five-year Inland Waterways Dredge Pilot
Program to increase the reliability, availability, and efficiency of
federally owned and operated inland waterways projects, provide cost
savings, and enhance the availability of container cargo on inland
waterways.

Energy Port Funding Allocation. The Corps has twice
failed to recommend a single dollar of HMTF towards the energy port
target in the fiscal year 2023 work plan to meet the funding
allocations outlined in WRDA 2020. Energy ports are critical to our
national supply chain and stable HTMF funding for expanded uses is
fundamental to maintaining international competitiveness. This funding
can assist with capital improvements at these critical ports, which
already pay a significant share of the collected tax. The Corps must
meet the donor and energy target in the FY24 work plan and include the
funding in future budget submissions.

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) permitting
processes transparency. Requiring The Corps to provide a report to the
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and the House
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) permitting processes, including the
length of time the Corps took to complete environmental assessments and
the number of outstanding assessments to be completed.

As a significant component of local, state, and national economies,
the health of our maritime system is essential to our way of life.
Dependable, modernized maritime infrastructure is critical in
maintaining and enhancing U.S. competitiveness in the global
marketplace. The undersigned organizations strongly support your
bipartisan leadership to improve our nation's infrastructure, and we
look forward to working with you to swiftly enact this legislation.

an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SAM GRAVES OF MISSOURI, CHAIRMAN,
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Graves of Missouri. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer.
And I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here
today.
This is our second hearing in preparation for the committee
writing and passing our sixth consecutive bipartisan Water
Resources Development Act since 2014, at least.
Ensuring effective and reliable water infrastructure is
vital to American families, to our businesses, to farms, and
the economic development of our country.
My district is bordered by two of the largest rivers in the
United States--on one side, the Missouri River, and on the
other side, the Mississippi River. And that is why a major
priority of mine is ensuring that our river navigation
infrastructure on the Mississippi and Missouri--and the rest of
the Nation's waterways, for that matter--gets the investment
that they desperately need.
In addition, we have to prioritize flood control. A little
too much rainfall and too little focus on flood control can
lead to disastrous results for people who live and work along
our Nation's waterways. And we learned that lesson the hard way
in 1993, in 2011, and again in 2019, when flooding along the
Missouri and Mississippi Rivers devastated communities all
across my district.
I have long been concerned that the current river
management incorrectly prioritizes fish and wildlife over the
protection of people and property. And that has led to many of
our tax dollars being wasted on supersized science experiments
instead of being responsibly invested in restoring levees and
increasing flood resilience. Addressing that is going to be a
top priority of mine throughout the development of WRDA 2024.
And, with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
[Mr. Graves of Missouri's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Sam Graves, a Representative in Congress
from the State of Missouri, and Chairman, Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure
Thank you, Chairman Rouzer, and thank you to our witnesses for
being here today.
This is our second hearing in preparation for the Committee writing
and passing our sixth consecutive bipartisan Water Resources
Development Act since 2014. Ensuring effective and reliable water
infrastructure is vital to American families, businesses, farms, and
the economic development of our country.
My district is bordered by two of the longest rivers in the United
States--the Missouri and the Mississippi. These Rivers provide millions
of Americans with water, provide thousands of farmers with irrigation
for their farmland, and provide an extremely efficient and reliable way
to move goods in and out of America's heartland. That's why a major
priority of mine is ensuring our river navigation infrastructure on the
Mississippi, Missouri, and the rest of our Nation's waterways gets the
investment it desperately needs.
In addition, we must prioritize flood control. A little too much
rainfall, and too little focus on flood control, can lead to disastrous
results for people who live and work along our Nation's waterways. We
learned that lesson the hard way in 1993, 2011, and again in 2019 when
flooding along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers devastated
communities across my district.
I have long been concerned that current river management
incorrectly prioritizes fish and wildlife over the protection of people
and property. And that's led to many of our tax dollars being wasted on
supersized science experiments instead of being responsibly invested in
restoring levees and increasing flood resilience. Addressing that will
be a top priority of mine throughout the development of WRDA 2024.

Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
I now recognize the ranking member of the full committee,
Mr. Larsen, for 5 minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING
MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for holding
this second hearing on the development of the Water Resources
Development Act.
In the Pacific Northwest and across the entire country,
businesses and communities understand the critical importance
of ports, harbors, and inland waterways to keeping goods that
we rely on moving, protecting homes from flood damage, and
preserving our ecosystems.
Since 2014, this committee has honored its commitment to
meet local water resource needs around the country carried out
by the Army Corps through regular enactment of bipartisan
WRDAs. WRDAs support projects that address local water resource
challenges to create jobs in construction, and support
industries and businesses that benefit directly from port
projects.
Regular, predictable enactment of WRDA also allows for the
implementation of critical and timely policy reforms that
improve the function and flexibility of the Corps to respond to
local water resource challenges.
WRDA 2022 is a blueprint for future WRDAs. It successfully
authorized the construction of 25 new projects covering each
facet of the Corps' missions, as well as almost 100 new
feasibility studies for future water resource development
projects.
WRDA 2022 also authorized a historic total of more than
$6.5 billion in environmental infrastructure assistance for
community-driven projects, including $200 million for locally
supported water and wastewater infrastructure projects in my
home State of Washington.
These Federal, State, and local partnerships are critical
to help address the growing water and the wastewater
infrastructure needs throughout the country.
WRDA 2024 is our opportunity to build on the bipartisan
successes of the last few bills. We can continue to advance
efforts to expand America's navigational capacity and
strengthen its supply chains through port, harbor, and inland
waterways development. We can continue to authorize job-
creating investments that simultaneously address the water
resource challenges facing our communities and support
national, regional, and local economies.
And we can continue to prepare our communities for the
challenges that the climate crisis poses as well as what
extreme weather events impose upon us. And we can continue to
promote equity for all communities by ensuring access to the
Corps' technical and planning expertise, as well as by
increasing the coordination between the Corps and Tribal,
minority, and disadvantaged communities.
Beyond regular enactment of WRDAs, Congress also needs to
provide sufficient funding to the Corps for project planning,
construction, and operation and maintenance so communities can
quickly realize the benefits of water resource improvements.
The $17 billion downpayment made through the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law is a great start, but Congress needs to
continue to sustain robust investment in our water
infrastructure into the future.
So, I look forward to the continued partnership with Chair
Graves, Chair Rouzer, and Ranking Member Napolitano as we
develop the new bipartisan WRDA 2024.
And, with that, I yield back.
[Mr. Larsen of Washington's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen, a Representative in Congress

With that, I yield back.

Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
I would now like to welcome our witnesses and thank them
for being here today.
I will identify each: Mr. Shane Kinne, executive director
of the Coalition to Protect the Missouri River; Mayor Teresa
Batts of Surf City, North Carolina; Mr. Jim Weakley, president
of the Lake Carriers' Association; Mr. Paul Anderson, president
and CEO of Port Tampa Bay; and Mr. Dave Mitamura, executive
director of the National Water Supply Alliance.
I want to briefly take a moment to explain the lighting
system, which is fairly self-explanatory. Green means go,
yellow means you have a little time left, and red means wrap it
up as quickly as possible.
I ask unanimous consent that the witnesses' full statements
be included in the record.
Without objection, so ordered.
I ask unanimous consent that the record of today's hearing
remain open until such time as our witnesses have provided
answers to any questions that may be submitted to them in
writing.
Without objection, so ordered.
I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open
for 15 days for additional comments and information submitted
by Members or witnesses to be included in the record of today's
hearing.
Without objection, so ordered.
As your written testimony has been made part of the record,
the subcommittee asks that you limit your oral remarks to 5
minutes.
I would now like to recognize the chairman of the full
committee, Mr. Graves, to introduce Mr. Kinne.
Mr. Graves of Missouri. So, thanks, Mr. Chairman, and I do
want to take just a moment to go in a little bit more depth on
Shane Kinne. He is the executive director, as was pointed out,
of the Missouri Coalition to Protect the Missouri River, and I
want to thank him for being here today.
The Coalition to Protect the Missouri River has been at the
forefront of the fight to ensure that the river is responsibly
managed and that we get back to the original intent of this
system--and that's navigation and flood control--and, at the
same time, balancing the other needs, which do include water
supplies and include science-based recovery of some endangered
species.
I have been proud to work with Shane on these efforts, both
in his current role with the coalition and also through his
work with the Missouri Corn Growers Association helping farmers
navigate the aftermath of the 2011 flood.
And I want to thank Shane again for your work and for
making the trip out here to testify today.
And I look forward to the testimonies.
And, with that, thanks, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Kinne, you are now recognized for 5
minutes.

TESTIMONY OF SHANE KINNE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COALITION TO
PROTECT THE MISSOURI RIVER; HON. TERESA B. BATTS, MAYOR, SURF
CITY, NORTH CAROLINA; JAMES WEAKLEY, PRESIDENT, LAKE CARRIERS'
ASSOCIATION; HON. PAUL ANDERSON, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, PORT TAMPA BAY, AND CHAIRMAN OF BOTH THE AMERICAN
ASSOCIATION OF PORT AUTHORITIES AND THE COALITION FOR AMERICA'S
GATEWAYS AND TRADE CORRIDORS; AND DAVE MITAMURA, EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR, NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY ALLIANCE

TESTIMONY OF SHANE KINNE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COALITION TO
PROTECT THE MISSOURI RIVER

Mr. Kinne. Chairman, members of the committee, and ranking
members, thank you for the opportunity to testify today
regarding WRDA 2024 and its importance for the Missouri River
and our stakeholders.
As mentioned, my name is Shane Kinne. I am the executive
director of the Coalition to Protect the Missouri River.
CPMR was established in 2001 and is made up of more than 30
members across 6 States in the Midwest region, and we support,
as the chairman indicated, responsible management of the
Missouri River resources as well as the maintenance and
enhancement of the congressionally authorized purposes of the
river, including flood control, navigation, and water supply.
We also support, as was indicated, science-based habitat
restoration for endangered or threatened species, provided
those management actions keep human interests and our members'
interests in mind and properly balanced.
We are here at a very important time when it comes to the
Missouri River and Missouri River management. While there are
challenges that I will discuss, we have much momentum on the
Missouri River, as well, in regards to flood control and to
navigation.
Much of this is due to recently passed WRDA bills and
generational authorizations of projects and studies that were
included in those WRDA bills. And if those studies and projects
are properly executed, it will have a long-term impact on the
Missouri River and our region.
In order for us, though, to continue to capitalize on that
momentum and the excitement we have going on in the Missouri
River, it is critical that Congress continues to pass WRDA
bills on time and every 2 years, as that is what we need to
capture that momentum and take action.
The historic flood of 2019 caused billions of dollars in
flood damages throughout Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Missouri,
with much of those damages in Missouri's Sixth Congressional
District, as the chairman indicated.
WRDA 2020 authorized the Lower Missouri River Flood
Resiliency Study, which is allowing our region to take a new
look at flood control along the Missouri River. This study is
going to focus on local solutions and increased resiliency of
flood control on the Missouri River.
As part of this study, it is critical that stakeholders
begin to see progress as soon as possible, which is why passing
a WRDA bill in 2024 is absolutely critical, so we can take
action on solutions that we already have agreement on moving
forward.
In addition, between disaster funding from 2019 and the
2022 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, over $469 million is being
invested in the Missouri River navigation channel. We are only
halfway through this investment in this project, and it is
already having a staggering impact on the resiliency of the
channel. Several navigators have shared with me recently that
they were able to move boats during the past 2 years of low
water when they wouldn't have been able to in previous years
without this work and rock placement.
Along with this success, WRDA 2020 also authorized the
Missouri River Navigation Resiliency Study that is allowing us
to take a fresh look at a broad range of factors that could
improve resiliency of navigation on the river. The timing of
this study, along with the Federal investment that I just
mentioned, is absolutely critical to gain momentum for shipping
on the river.
Commercial traffic is increasing on the river to levels we
haven't seen in decades, with the Port of Blencoe at Blencoe,
Iowa, opening in 2021 with NEW Cooperative of Iowa. They have
had three successful navigation seasons north of Omaha,
Nebraska.
Prior to opening this port, NEW Co-Op transported
fertilizer up the Mississippi River and across the State of
Iowa via truck, and now they are able to move fertilizer all
the way up the Missouri River to their northwest Iowa
locations. This has saved them roughly 250,000 truck-miles
every year the last 3 years off the road, which shows the
significance of the impact of being able to move product on
barge.
In addition to moving fertilizer up, they were able to move
corn, soybean meal, distillers grain, and scrap iron back
south, being able to use both directions of the river.
Passing a WRDA bill in 2024 is critical to leveraging this
success that we are experiencing now into long-term
resiliency--not just resiliency of the Missouri River, but also
of the Mississippi River, as well.
Flows from the Missouri River are critical to shipping on
the middle Mississippi River between St. Louis, Missouri, and
Cairo, Illinois. And this just highlights the national
importance of movement on the Missouri River and flows on the
Missouri River, especially right now as we see those low flows.
We, as CPMR, have shaped our priorities to promote
continued progress in all these areas. And they include
shifting the previously mentioned Navigation Resiliency Study
from a 50/50 cost-share to a 75/25 cost-share due to its
national impact, its regional impact, and to ensure that this
study is completed on time and gives local stakeholders the
confidence of that long-term resiliency while maintaining
important stakeholder buy-in. Shipping reliability and cost-
share shift will maintain that input.
Bank erosion continues to be an issue as well, and those
are also included in our priorities.
These are just a few of our priorities. We will submit our
full list to the committee.
Again, we appreciate the opportunity to talk about the
Missouri River today and its impact regionally and nationally
and look forward to this committee's work on WRDA 2024.
[Mr. Kinne's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Shane Kinne, Executive Director, Coalition to
Protect the Missouri River
Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for the
opportunity to testify today regarding WRDA 2024 and its importance to
Missouri River stakeholders. I'm Shane Kinne, Executive Director of the
Coalition to Protect the Missouri River.
CPMR was established in 2001, and is made up of more than 30

Missouri River resources, as well as the maintenance and enhancement of
congressionally authorized purposes of the river, including flood
control, navigation and water supply. We also support science-based

management actions are responsibly conducted and properly balanced with
our members' interests.
We are in a very important time period for the Missouri River.
While there are challenges, there is much momentum, both for flood
control as well as navigation on the Missouri River. Much of this is
due to recently passed WRDA bills that authorized important,
generational projects and studies that, if properly executed, will
improve the lives of those that live and work in the lower Missouri
River basin. In order for us to continue to capture and capitalize on
that momentum, it is critical that Congress continues to pass WRDA
bills consistently and on-time.
The historic flood of 2019 caused billions of dollars in damages in
the states of Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and Missouri with much of that in
Missouri's 6th District.
WRDA 2020 authorized the Lower Missouri River Flood Resiliency
Study, allowing our region to take a new look at flood control along
the Missouri River. This study will focus on local solutions and
increased resiliency. As part of this study, it is critical that
stakeholders begin to see progress as soon as possible. Passing a WRDA
bill in 2024 will allow us to take a step forward now on agreed-upon
solutions, while the full study progresses.
In addition, between disaster funding from the 2019 flood and 2022
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, over $469 million is being
invested in the Missouri River navigation channel. We are only halfway
through this project and it is already having a staggering impact on
the resiliency of the channel. Several navigators have shared that they
have been able to move boats during the past two years of low water,
when they previously wouldn't have been able to.
Along with this success, WRDA 2020 also authorized a Missouri River
navigation resiliency study that is allowing us to take a fresh look at
a broad range of factors that could improve resiliency of navigation on
the river. The timing of this study with the federal investment into
the river is critical.
Commercial traffic is increasing on the Missouri River to levels we
haven't seen in decades. The Port of Blencoe, located at MOR 680.5,
Blencoe Iowa was opened by farmer-owned NEW Cooperative in 2021. Having
three successful navigation seasons north of Omaha, Nebraska has
allowed NEW Cooperative to reduce their truck miles on Iowa highways by
approximately 249,491 miles annually. Prior to opening this port, NEW
Cooperative transported fertilizer from the Mississippi River, all the
way across the state of Iowa in the spring. The operation of this
facility allows the efficient movement of fertilizer and additional
commodities up the Missouri River, and also allows barges to be
reloaded with products such as soybean meal, dried distillers grain,
soybeans, corn, and scrap iron to ship back south. This is just one
example of success stories we are seeing.
Passing a WRDA bill in 2024 is critical to leveraging this success
into long-term resiliency. Not just resiliency of the Missouri River,
but also the Mississippi River. Flows from the Missouri River are
critical to shipping on the middle Mississippi River between St. Louis,
Missouri and Cairo, Illinois, highlighting their national importance.
CPMR has shaped our WRDA 2024 priorities to promote continued
progress in these areas.
Our priorities include:

Shifting the previously mentioned Missouri River
Navigation Resiliency Study from 50/50 cost share study to a 75/25 cost
share. This study will have national impact to shipping reliability and
this cost share shift will provide certainty to it's completion while
maintaining stakeholder input.

Bank erosion and land loss continue to be a challenge for
landowners and also threaten the viability of levee systems. WRDA 2022
included a pilot program to address this issue. In WRDA 2024 we are
advocating to expand this to a permanent authority for the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers to address critical bank erosion.

In WRDA 2022 the USACE was required to inventory non-
USACE federal lands that would physically qualify for Bank
Stabilization and Navigation Project mitigation acres. CPMR supports
movement toward ensuring those lands are counted in the 166,000 acres
as well as looking at what state lands should qualify.

These are just a few of our WRDA priorities. We will submit our
full list as part of the record. They include additional items to
promote navigation and flood risk resiliency while also protecting
private property and businesses that operate on the Missouri River.
Failing to pass a WRDA bill in 2024 will mean missed opportunities
at a critical time to support resiliency of flood control, navigation
and water supply uses in the region. Thank you for your efforts to pass
this legislation and thank you again for the opportunity to testify
today.

Mr. Rouzer. Ms. Batts, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. TERESA B. BATTS, MAYOR, SURF CITY, NORTH
CAROLINA

Ms. Batts. Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano,
Chairman Graves, and Ranking Member Larsen, it is an honor and
a privilege to testify before this distinguished subcommittee
today to discuss the town of Surf City's Federal coastal storm
risk project.
My name is Teresa Batts, and I am the mayor of Surf City,
North Carolina.
Passing the Water Resources Development Act, or WRDA, on a
biennial basis has provided the Nation's coastal engineering
community with the reliability and certainty that it needs to
advance critical resilience projects like the one at Surf City.
The town supports the development of WRDA 2024. We
acknowledge the tremendous bipartisan track record of this
important infrastructure bill. Thank you for your leadership
and commitment to the authorizing process.
I would also like to acknowledge Chairman Rouzer, an ardent
champion for U.S. coastal resilience and for the North Carolina
beach communities. Thank you for your support in highlighting
our WRDA needs.
Chairman Rouzer, you have visited Surf City numerous times.
I am certain you remember meeting myself and members of the
council following Hurricane Florence and recall the damage it
caused in our communities.
These photos give you a sense of the extreme vulnerability
that Surf City faces. They were taken post-Florence and
illustrate the consequences of not having adequate beach and
dune infrastructure in place. As Chairman Rouzer mentioned last
week, our Federal nourishment project is long overdue.
The town of Surf City is located in the heart of Topsail
Island, North Carolina, and it serves as the economic engine
for the surrounding island and inland communities. Our
residents and property owners have strong ties to the coastal
environment, representing commercial and recreational
fishermen, a thriving agriculture industry, as well as retail,
restaurants, and other businesses. A majority of households
make between $50,000 to $150,000 per year. These are people
that work in our schools, support the tourism sector, and work
in construction.
Please consider an open invitation to visit Surf City.
[Slides shown.]
Beaches and dunes are a proven form of natural
infrastructure. They protect coastal communities like Surf City
from flooding, ensuring local businesses are still running
after a storm and that coastal residents can return to their
homes quickly with few repairs. Proactively investing in wide
beaches and high vegetative dunes save the Federal Government
money by reducing post-disaster recovery payments.
Storm risk management is not the only reason to invest in
coastal infrastructure projects. Beaches are economic engines,
dominating 66 percent of the U.S. tourism market. Surf City,
for example, offers an affordable, working-class vacation to
the American people. Tourists will stop coming to the beaches
if they go away.
Beaches create jobs, too. Nationally, the ocean-based
tourism sector employs more Americans than the entire real
estate industry, as well as more people than telecommunications
and building construction combined. Surf City's economy is
entirely dependent on the beach.
The town of Surf City requires authorization of our coastal
storm risk management project in WRDA 2024. As Chairman Rouzer
explained in last week's hearing, despite initial authorization
in WRRDA 2014, the town has yet to see construction of the
Federal beach project.
As the photos show, 13 years without a project has led to
increased vulnerability and reduced protection. Delays in the
project have led to the loss of millions of Federal, State, and
local tax dollars due to price escalation in dredging costs.
The town has also invested significant dollars in erosion
mitigation, including $14 million in a sand truck haul project
to shore up the disappearing beach.
When the town learned of the construction funding for this
project through the Disaster Recovery Act in 2019, we
immediately engaged with the Wilmington District and the South
Atlantic Division, who have been wonderful partners throughout
this long process.
Because North Topsail Beach withdrew their project in 2021,
we need authorization for a Surf City-only project in the DRA
2019 funds. Currently, investigation funds that will lead to
the construction are awaiting approval.
Surf City has been prepared to sign a project partnership
agreement to see this project to construction since day one.
The town faithfully procured land to increase our public
parking and access to the beach. We have secured over 86
percent of our necessary easements and are dedicated to
obtaining 100 percent.
In closing, Surf City is grateful to the subcommittee and
Congress for ensuring the critical missions of the Army Corps
of Engineers. The Federal project will provide not only our
first large-scale nourishment project but will also serve as a
longer term solution to maintaining our beaches that our
residents and visitors both cherish and respect greatly.
As shown today, we are in desperate need of new
authorization for a Surf City-only project, which can only
happen through the WRDA process. The town of Surf City supports
timely passage of WRDA 2024 and respectfully requests the
subcommittee's support to include this project.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify today.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Teresa B. Batts, Mayor, Surf City, North
Carolina, Prepared With Assistance From Nicole Elko, Ph.D., Executive
Director, American Shore & Beach Preservation Association
Chairman Rouzer and Ranking Member Napolitano, it is an honor and a
privilege to testify before this distinguished subcommittee today to
discuss the Town of Surf City's federal coastal storm damage reduction
project. My name is Teresa Batts and I am the mayor of Surf City, North
Carolina.
Passing the Water Resources Development Act, or WRDA as it is
commonly referred to, on a biannual basis has provided the nation's
coastal engineering community with the reliability and certainty that
it needs to advance critical resilience projects like the one at Surf
City. The Town of Surf City supports the development of WRDA 2024 and
we would like to acknowledge the tremendous bipartisan track record of
this important infrastructure bill. Thank you for your leadership and
commitment to this authorizing process.
I would also like to acknowledge Chairman Rouzer, an ardent
champion for U.S. coastal resilience and for North Carolina beach
communities. Congressman Rouzer, thank you for your support of the Town
of Surf City and for highlighting our WRDA needs.
Chairman Rouzer, you have visited Surf City numerous times and I'm
quite certain you remember meeting with myself and members of our
Council following Hurricane Florence and recall the damage it caused in
our community. These photos give the other subcommittee members a sense
of the extreme vulnerability that Surf City faces. They were taken post
Florence and illustrate the consequences of not having an adequate dune
structure in place. You can see the exposed infrastructure and the
devastation this creates. As Chairman Rouzer mentioned last week, our
federal nourishment project is long overdue.
The Town of Surf City was founded in 1949. We are located in the
heart of Topsail Island, North Carolina, and serve as the economic
engine for the surrounding island and inland communities. Our residents
and property owners have strong ties to the coastal environment,
representing commercial and recreational fisherman, a thriving
aquaculture industry, as well as retail, restaurants, and other
businesses, all within a vibrant, family friendly, small town
environment.
I hope the committee will consider my open invitation to visit Surf
City. In the meantime, I appreciate the opportunity today to highlight
the desperate need for authorization of our federal project as well as
the value that the coastal mission of the US Army Corps of Engineers'
(Corps) provides to the nation.
Beaches and dunes are a proven form of natural infrastructure. They
protect coastal communities like Surf City from flooding, ensuring that
local businesses are still running after a storm, and that coastal
residents can return to their homes quickly with few repairs. Economic
benefits of storm protection for our roads, infrastructure, and private
property are of utmost importance. Proactively investing in wide
beaches and high, vegetated dunes saves the federal government money by
reducing post-disaster recovery payments.
Beaches, dunes and wetlands are, simply put, wise fiscal
investments. Proactively investing in coastal infrastructure will save
the federal government money by reducing post-disaster recovery
payments.
Storm risk management is not the only reason to invest in coastal
infrastructure projects. The beach is the reason tourists visit Surf
City, as well as every other beach town in the U.S. A 2022 study found
that beach vacations were the most popular destinations, accounting for
66% of family trips. Remember, most U.S. beach towns are not the land
of the rich and famous. We offer an affordable, working-class vacation
to the American public. Tourists spend money in my town, in the hotels,
restaurants, and shops because they are on a beach vacation. They will
stop coming if the beach goes away.
Beaches create jobs too. Nationally, the ocean-based tourism and
recreation sector employs more Americans than the entire real estate
industry, as well as more people than building construction and
telecommunications combined. People don't come to my town for health
care or to work in a textile plant. A majority of households make
between $50,000 and $150,000 per year, demonstrating a strong presence
of middle-income residents. These are people that work in our schools,
support the tourism sector, and work in construction.
For every dollar the federal government spends on beach
restoration, you collect at least $250 in beach tourist tax revenues.
When this revenue is combined with the cost savings from coastal
disasters and the recreational and workforce benefits that beaches
provide, it is crystal clear that these projects are excellent national
investments that increase coastal resilience.
The Town of Surf City requires authorization of our Coastal Storm
Risk Management project in WRDA 2024. The initial Chief's Report that
combined Surf City with North Topsail Beach was completed in 2010 and
authorized in WRDA 2014. Thirteen years later, our town has yet to see
construction of a federal beach project. This time span has led to
increased vulnerability due to reduced protection. The Town has been,
and remains, committed to this project as we feel that a Corps' beach
provides us the best protection for the taxpayers dollar. Delays in the
project have led to a loss of millions of federal, state, and local tax
dollars due to price escalation in the dredging industry over this time
frame. The Town has also invested significantly in erosion mitigation
efforts during this time including a $14 million sand truck haul
project to shore up the disappearing beach.
When the Town was notified of construction funding for this project
through the Disaster Recovery Act of 2019, we were immediately engaged
with the Wilmington District to complete the necessary local items to
advance the project. The Wilmington District and South Atlantic
Division have been wonderful partners throughout this very long
process. North Topsail Beach, on the other hand, withdrew from the
project in 2021. This requires a new authorization for a Surf City only
project in order to use the DRA 2019 funds. Currently, investigation
funds that will ultimately lead to construction are awaiting approval.
Surf City has been prepared to sign a Project Partnership Agreement
and see this project to construction since Day 1. The Town faithfully
procured land to increase our public parking and access to the beach,
we have secured over 86% of easements necessary to authorize the Corps'
and its contractors to complete the work and are dedicated to obtaining
100%. Simply stated, the Town has been a great partner to the Corps'
and will continue throughout the lifespan of this critical project for
the Town of Surf City.
Surf City is grateful to your subcommittees and Congress for
ensuring that the critical missions of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
are authorized and implemented. On behalf of my fellow community
leaders, thank you for WRDA22 with its many coastal provisions. We
recognize the need for implementation. Improving the resilience of
coastal communities will take coordination across multiple federal
agencies working together with state and local authorities. Most
importantly for our town, the Surf City Coastal Storm Risk Management
project will provide not only the first large-scale nourishment project
for our coastline, but also serve as the longer term solution to
maintaining the beach that our residents and visitors both cherish and
respect greatly.
In closing, we are in desperate need of new authorization for a
``Surf City only'' project to be eligible for construction, which can
only happen through the WRDA process. The Town of Surf City supports
timely passage of WRDA 2024 and respectfully requests the
subcommittee's support to include this project. Thank you for the
opportunity to testify today.

TESTIMONY OF JAMES WEAKLEY, PRESIDENT, LAKE CARRIERS'
ASSOCIATION

Mr. Weakley. Thank you.
Since 1880, the Lake Carriers' Association has represented
U.S. flagships moving 90 million tons of cargo annually. They
are the building blocks of America: iron ore, construction
stone, coal, cement, grain, salt, and sand. Our economy and our
national security need a resilient Great Lakes Navigation
System, or GLNS.
It is the most efficient and environmentally sustainable
mode. Our Jones Act qualified vessels can move a ton of cargo
600 miles on 1 gallon of fuel. One of our 1,000-foot-long ships
carries 70,000 tons, the equivalent of 40 river barges, 700
railcars, or 2,800 trucks. With our efficiency, trucks could
use lawnmower engines.
The Corps estimates our transportation rate savings at $3.9
billion. The industry drives $36 billion in economic activity,
generates $6 billion in tax revenue and 147,350 U.S. jobs, with
more than $17.8 billion in wages annually.
WRDA is the most important piece of legislation Americans
have never heard of. It authorizes maritime infrastructure.
Providing for the national defense and facilitating commerce
are two basic functions of the Federal Government. WRDA
accomplishes both.
When I started at LCA, the GLNS was unsustainable. The
Corps was not funded to remove the 3.3 million cubic yards of
annual sedimentation clogging our navigational arteries in
America's heartland. The backlog peaked at 18 million cubic
yards. For every inch of navigational depth lost, our largest
vessels lose 270 tons of cargo. U.S. lakers light-loaded three
of every four voyages, and vessels grounded in the navigation
channel.
The Corps was on a 400-year pace to recapitalize
infrastructure. The locks in Michigan were poorly funded and
less reliable. The new Soo lock was authorized in 1986 and
languished on congressional life support. Multiple Congresses
would not pass WRDA, and the system was in a death spiral.
A Department of Homeland Security study estimated an
unplanned closure of a single Soo lock would result in a
recession and 11 million Americans unemployed. Twice, WRDA
reauthorized the construction of a new Soo lock.
It took multiple WRDAs to right the ship. Bills provided
greater access to the industry-funded Harbor Maintenance Trust
Fund and its $10 billion surplus. WRDAs resuscitated the GLNS
and placed it on a healthier diet of regular authorizations and
more funding.
I am a strong proponent of the 2-year WRDA cycle. It
provides new opportunities, policy corrections, increased
funding authorizations, and congressional guidance. It is
simply good governance.
I know the Great Lakes Navigation System may need further
authorizations to address material management and to provide
beneficial use opportunities. The 2-year WRDA cycle provides
the needed flexibility for better stewardship of
infrastructure, environmental resources, and precious tax
dollars.
I have two specific requests for WRDA 2024.
The five Great Lakes connecting channels should be 100
percent federally funded, as are the Soo locks. These are
system resources and should not require a non-Federal sponsor.
We need to fix Middle Neebish Channel in the St. Marys
River. It should only have one authorized depth, not two. It is
unusual. It is a safety hazard. Nothing separates the shallow
and the deep sides. It is a problem navigating in the ice,
particularly when the Coast Guard closes the downbound channel,
forcing transits in the opposite direction. This channel's
design creates a safety hazard. We don't need a study; we need
action. First, deepen the turns.
I support the 2-year WRDA cycle. It is good governance.
WRDAs resurrected the Great Lakes Navigation System. We are
asking for two small fixes: full Federal funding of the
connecting channels and fixing the Middle Neebish Channel. We
will be back, given the appropriate legislative pace, for
additional requests.
Please pass WRDA 2024.
Thank you.
[Mr. Weakley's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of James Weakley, President, Lake Carriers'
Association
The below testimony provides support for a predictable two-year
Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) cycle, discusses the importance
of WRDA to the Great Lakes Navigation System (GLNS), and presents two
specific requests for WRDA 2024: full federal funding for the
maintenance of the five Great Lakes connecting channels and a single
authorized depth for a portion of one of those connecting channels.
Since 1880, the Lake Carriers' Association (LCA) has represented
the U.S.-flag Great Lakes fleet, which today can move 90 million tons
of cargos annually. They are the building blocks of American
manufacturing, infrastructure, and energy: iron ore, construction
stone, coal, cement, and other dry bulk materials such as grain, salt,
and sand.
Now more than ever, the national economy and our national security
need a reliable and resilient Great Lakes maritime transportation
system that stretches over 1,600 miles from Duluth, MN, to the Saint
Lawrence Seaway. It is the most efficient, environmentally friendly,
and socially responsible mode of transportation. Our Jones Act
qualified vessels can move a ton of cargo more than 600 miles using a
single gallon of fuel. One of our 1,000-foot long ships can carry as
much as 70,000 net tons of cargo. That is the equivalent of 40 river
barges, 700 rail cars, or 2,800 25-ton trucks. For trucks to match our
horsepower-to-ton efficiency, they would need to be moved with a 5-
horsepower lawnmower engine.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) estimates that the GLNS
results in an annual transportation rate savings of $3.9 billion
annually. A recent report, Economic Impacts of Maritime Shipping in the
Great Lakes [https://lcaships.com/programs/economy/economic-impacts-
jobs/], highlights Great Lakes shipping's contribution to the success
of our nation. The industry drives $36 billion in annual economic
activity, which generates more than $6 billion in tax revenue annually.
147,350 U.S. jobs are tied to our fourth seacoast and more than $17.8
billion in family sustaining wages are paid every year.
WRDA is the most important piece of legislation that most Americans
have never heard of. It authorizes funds for our nation's maritime
infrastructure. We are and always have been a maritime nation. WRDA
sets policy; authorizes studies, projects, and project modifications;
and provides Congressional direction to the Corps. Providing for
national defense and facilitating commerce are two of the basic
functions of the Federal Government. WRDA accomplishes both of these.
When I started at the LCA over 20 years ago, the Great Lakes
maritime infrastructure was on an unsustainable and downward
trajectory. The Corps was not funded to remove the 3.3 million cubic
yards of annual sedimentation clogging the navigational arteries in the
GLNS, America's heartland. The situation would only worsen, peaking at
18 million cubic yards as measured from the ``functional dimensions''
in 2007 and again in 2103. The ``functional dimension'' only exists in
the Great Lakes. It is the minimum opening that will allow vessels to
operate in the channel. In some cases, it means allowing only one-way
traffic, even though the waterway is authorized for two-way traffic.
The rest of the nation, if not the world, measures its dredging backlog
from ``authorized dimensions.'' That is an example of how bad things
were in the GLNS.
For every inch of navigational depth lost by our largest vessels,
270 tons of cargo are not carried. From 2007 to 2012, U.S.-flag
operators light loaded their vessels on 3 of every 4 voyages. In 2012
alone, there were 9 vessel groundings in GLNS navigation channels.
The Corps was on a 400-year pace to recapitalize the region's
breakwalls and jetties. Using the period of the last 8 years, the Corps
is now recapitalizing those structures on a 25-year pace. The Corps'
navigation locks in Sault Ste. Marie, MI (Soo Locks), connecting Lake
Superior with Lake Huron, were poorly funded and becoming less
reliable. The new Soo Lock authorized in 1986 had languished on
Congressional life support with little progress. Multiple Congresses
would come and go without passing a WRDA and one could argue that the
system was in a slow death spiral.
It took multiple WRDAs to provide the necessary course corrections
to right the ship. In 2011, I testified before this subcommittee in
support of H.R. 104, Realizing America's Maritime Promise (RAMP) Act, a
variation of which was later incorporated into WRDA and improved by
subsequent laws. The bill allowed greater access to the Harbor
Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF), which is funded by the ad valorem cargo
tax assessed on maritime cargo to fund harbor maintenance. Eventually,
WRDA also authorized the drawdown of the $10 billion surplus that had
accumulated in the HMTF since its inception. This increased funding
both reduced the GLNS dredging backlog and increased the pace of
breakwall and jetty repairs nationwide. WRDA 2014 authorized the GLNS
for the first time as a system and recognized the interconnectivity and
interdependence of our Great Lakes ports. A 2015 Department of Homeland
Security Study, The Perils of Efficiency [https://www.remi.com/wp-
content/uploads/2021/08/DHS-OCIA-The-Perils-of-Efficiency-An-Analysis-
of-an-Unexpected-Closure-of-the-Poe-Lock-and-Its-Impact.pdf], pointed
out that an unplanned 6-month closure of a single navigation lock, the
Poe, at the Soo Locks would result in a North American resource-driven
recession and 11 million unemployed Americans. Armed with that
knowledge, this Subcommittee twice used WRDA to reauthorize the
construction of the new Soo Lock project to provide system resiliency.
That project is well underway and on schedule for completion in 2030.
It took multiple WRDAs to revive the GLNS and place it on a
healthier diet of regular authorizations and more appropriate funding
levels. I am a strong proponent of the 2-year WRDA cycle. It provides
new opportunities, policy course corrections, increased funding
authorizations, and Congressional guidance. It is simply good
governance. Even though I have only two WRDA requests for this bill, I
know at some point, the GLNS may need additional authorization language
to address the emerging problem of dredged material management and
provide other beneficial use opportunities for unconfined placement,
particularly for Lake Erie ports. We may need future WRDA language to
increase dredging capacity or to make the current capability more
efficient. I know we will need future WRDA language to deal with
problems that we can't even anticipate. The 2-year WRDA cycle provides
the needed flexibility and process to address needs in a timely manner.
The Corps needs and deserves Congressional authorization and direction
to be better stewards of our nation's maritime navigation
infrastructure, environmental resources, and precious tax dollars.
On behalf of my members and the GLNS, I have two specific requests
for WRDA 2024:

Any study, design, or construction of improvements to Great
Lakes ``connecting channels'' should be 100% federally funded,
as are the Soo Locks. They should not require a nonfederal
sponsor. There are five connecting channels on the Great Lakes:
the St. Marys River (connecting Lake Superior with Lake Huron),
the Detroit River, the St. Clair River, the Channels in Lake
St. Clair (connecting Lake Huron to Lake Erie) and the Straits
of Mackinac (connecting Lake Michigan to Lake Huron). These are
``system'' resources and should not require a nonfederal
sponsor. The Straits of Mackinaw are naturally deep and require
little maintenance. The St. Marys River, which requires
dredging and may soon require a nonfederal sponsor in order for
the Corps to address dredged material management needs, unless
this request is enacted. The Detroit/St. Clair River does not
immediately need a nonfederal sponsor to address dredged
material management but will in the future. Once the Corps
implements the new Great Lakes water level datum, this problem
could become even bigger and more urgent.

The upbound channel of the St. Marys River in the vicinity of
Neebish Island, the Middle Neebish Channel, should be
authorized at the deeper depth (27 or 28 feet depending on the
location). Currently it is split down its length and the
channel has both a 21 foot and 27/28 foot project depth for the
same stretch of the river. This is very unusual. It is a relic
from the 1960s when the downbound West Neebish Channel was
being constructed and vessels had to go in both directions via
the Middle Neebish Channel and upbound vessels were expected to
be empty. It also limits the ability of vessels to load more
cargo when taking cargo to Lake Superior because today's
vessels are larger. This is a safety hazard. There is nothing
separating the shallower and deeper sides of the channel. They
are simply marked with different range markers, which can be a
bit confusing. It is also a problem while navigating when the
channel is covered by ice. We have experienced several
instances of vessels going aground on the shallow side of the
channel. Sometimes it is a result of navigational error, but it
can be a result of ship handling problems caused by ice or
wind. It is particularly a problem when the Coast Guard closes
the downbound channel and forces vessels to transit the upbound
channel in the opposite direction. Once the historical anomaly
is corrected, our first priority would be to deepen the turns
to facilitate navigation, particularly during the winter
icebreaking operations. I want to emphasize that this is an
existing authorized channel; its design creates a safety
hazard. We don't need a study, we need action. The
appropriations process can prioritize the turns over the
straightaways and allow this project to compete with other
projects.
Conclusion
I applaud your commitment to the two-year WRDA cycle. It provides
the needed flexibility, progress, and good governance. This Committee
and WRDA are directly responsible for the resurrection of the GLNS.
Thank you for that! This year, we are asking for two small changes:
full federal funding of connecting channels and fixing Middle Neebish
Channel. You have accomplished much and there is more to be done. We
will be back, given the appropriate legislative pace, when the time is
right for additional requests. I urge passage of WRDA 2024.

Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Anderson.

TESTIMONY OF HON. PAUL ANDERSON, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, PORT TAMPA BAY, AND CHAIRMAN OF BOTH THE AMERICAN
ASSOCIATION OF PORT AUTHORITIES AND THE COALITION FOR AMERICA'S
GATEWAYS AND TRADE CORRIDORS

Mr. Anderson. Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano,
and members of the subcommittee, it is a pleasure to be here
today not only as the president and CEO of Port Tampa Bay but
also as a representative of America's vast network of ports and
trade corridors. Thank you for your invitation.
I am speaking today in my dual role as chairman of the
American Association of Port Authorities and the Coalition for
America's Gateways and Trade Corridors.
The Water Resources Development Act is a lifeline for our
Nation's economic and infrastructural progress. The biennial
rhythm of WRDA is vital for the sustenance and growth of trade
and commerce across our great Nation. This consistent cycle
allows us at Port Tampa Bay and others like us to plan,
develop, and execute projects critical to our Nation's economic
security and growth.
Port Tampa Bay, as Florida's largest port, is a cornerstone
in the State's supply chain, yet our influence extends far
beyond State lines. The proposed deepening of our 47-mile-long
shipping channel, a project awaiting the August Chief's Report
from the Army Corps of Engineers, will upgrade the national
supply chain infrastructure--a strategic move that will reduce
congestion in out-of-State ports and a commitment to enhancing
the efficiency of national logistics.
We understand the August timetable does not quite align
with the House and Senate consideration of WRDA, but we hope
Congress will include the authority to construct this project
in any final legislation.
The deepening of Tampa Harbor will generate average annual
transportation benefits of $88.5 million for our Nation,
according to the Army Corps' feasibility study. This project,
however, hinges on the timely progression of the WRDA cycle.
Nearly 70 percent of the 20 million cubic yards of the
material dredged as part of our deepening will be reused at a
number of sites, including restoration of Egmont Key, a
national and historic treasure.
Now let me speak to the significance of this legislation to
the American Association of Port Authorities.
AAPA is the unified voice of the seaport industry in the
Americas. And my testimony is given on behalf of State and
local public agencies located in the Atlantic, Pacific, and
gulf coasts; the Great Lakes; and in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto
Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
For more than a century, AAPA membership has empowered port
authorities to serve global customers and create economic and
social value for their communities. Our Nation's seaports
deliver vital goods to consumers, facilitate the export of
American-made goods, create jobs, and support local and
national economic growth.
Ports also play a crucial role in our national defense--a
point acknowledged through the designation of 18 of our
Nation's commercial ports as ``strategic seaports,'' as
designated by the Department of Defense.
The total economic value generated in terms of revenue to
businesses, personal income, and the economic output at U.S.
coastal ports accounted for $5.4 trillion, roughly 26 percent
of our Nation's GDP. This research also showed over 30.8
million Americans are employed in jobs generated as a result.
The Water Resources Development Act is a key piece of
legislation that provides essential authority for water
infrastructure projects across our Nation. WRDA provides
authority for the Army Corps of Engineers to carry out projects
related to flood control, navigation, and environmental
restoration.
WRDA plays a critical role in protecting our environment
and our natural resources. It provides authority for projects
to restore wetlands, protect endangered species, and improve
water quality.
Congress must continue to support this legislation and
provide the necessary funding and authority to carry out these
important projects. It is critical to U.S. ports and U.S.
exporter competitiveness that Congress continue enacting WRDA
legislation every 2 years.
It is my request that a bipartisan effort be made to ensure
timely passage of WRDA, not just for the benefit of our port at
Port Tampa Bay, but for every port, every State, and every
citizen who relies on the seamless flow of goods and services
that our ports facilitate.
Thank you for your time today, your consideration, and your
pivotal role in the shaping of the future of our Nation's trade
and infrastructure.
Thank you.
[Mr. Anderson's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Paul Anderson, President and Chief Executive
Officer, Port Tampa Bay, and Chairman of both the American Association
of Port Authorities and the Coalition for America's Gateways and Trade
Corridors
Mr. Chairman, thank you for your invitation to testify this
afternoon about the importance of the Committee's commitment to enact
into law every two years a comprehensive and bipartisan Water Resources
Development Act, or WRDA as it is commonly known.
I am speaking today not only as the President and CEO of Port Tampa
Bay, but also as the Chairman of both the American Association of Port
Authorities (AAPA) and the Coalition for America's Gateways and Trade
Corridors (CAGTC). It is my goal to talk discuss how the WRDA process
not only impacts Port Tampa Bay, but all of America's ports and trade
gateways.
I would like to thank the Water Resources and Environment
Subcommittee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for
working to ensure that our nation's maritime transportation system
remains functional. As maritime trade continues to rebalance from the
recent COVID-19 pandemic-driven supply chain disruptions, your
recognition of the important role played by our nation's ports and Army
Corps of Engineers' maritime navigation infrastructure has been
critical. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today and discuss how
we can continue to maintain this nationally critical infrastructure for
generations to come.
WRDA is a lifeline for our nation's economic and infrastructure
progress. The biennial rhythm of WRDA is vital for the sustenance and
growth of trade and commerce across our great nation. WRDA's consistent
schedule allows Port Tampa Bay, and others like us, to plan, develop,
and execute projects critical to our nation's economic security and
growth. This is a key piece of legislation that provides essential
authority for water infrastructure projects across the country. It
helps to ensure that our nation's ports, harbors, and other waterways
are maintained and improved, and that they can continue to support
economic growth and development. WRDA provides authority for the Army
Corps of Engineers to carry out projects related to flood control,
navigation, and environmental restoration. These projects are vital to
protecting our communities from the devastating impacts of floods and
other natural disasters, and they help to ensure that our waterways
remain open and accessible to shipping and commerce. In addition, WRDA
plays a critical role in protecting our environment and our natural
resources. It provides authority for projects that restore wetlands,
protect endangered species, and improve water quality. These projects
are essential to preserving our natural heritage and ensuring the
health and well-being of our communities.
WRDA supports economic growth, protects our environment, and
ensures the safety and well-being of our communities. Congress must
continue to support this legislation and provide the necessary
authority to carry out these important projects. It is critical to U.S.
port and exporter competitiveness that Congress continue enacting WRDA
legislation every two years to minimize delays in updating this
infrastructure to keep up with the demands of maritime commerce.
Port Tampa Bay, Florida's largest port, is a cornerstone in the
state's supply chain, but our influence also extends far beyond state
lines. The proposed deepening of our 47-mile-long shipping channel, a
project awaiting the August Chief's Report from the Army Corps of
Engineers, is more than a local enhancement. It will upgrade national
supply chain infrastructure which is a strategic move to reduce
congestion in out-of-state ports and will also support the efficiency
of national logistics. The deepening of the Tampa harbor will generate
an average annual transportation benefit of $88.5 million for the
nation, according to the Army Corps' feasibility study. This project,
however, hinges on the timely progression of the WRDA cycle. A delay in
WRDA is not just a postponement of a project; it's a setback for our
national economic interests, a ripple effect that slows our ability to
advance towards a more prosperous and resilient future.
Our approach to development at Port Tampa Bay is not just about
expansion but also about resiliency and responsible growth. We believe
that our projects have shown a proven track record to this commitment.
Port Tampa Bay supports an MSA with over 3.2 million people, the 17th
largest in the country, in the nation's third most populous state.
Nearly 70 percent of the 20 million cubic yards of the material dredged
as a part of our deepened channel will be reused at a number of sites
locally. For example, dredged material from the channel deepening will
be repurposed for the restoration of Egmont Key, a national and
historic treasure, and for the creation of new industrial land. A
balanced approach ensures that while we grow, we also protect and
enrich our environment.
As the Chairman of the AAPA, my testimony is given on behalf of
state and local public agencies located along the Atlantic, Pacific,
and Gulf coasts, the Great Lakes, and in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico,
Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For more than a century, AAPA
membership has empowered port authorities to serve global customers and
create economic and social value for their communities. Today in our
nation's Capital, AAPA is representing ports on urgent and pressing
issues facing our industry, promoting the common interests of the port
community, and providing critical industry leadership on security,
trade, transportation, infrastructure, environmental, and other issues
related to port development and operations.
Port authorities are governmental entities that own facilities at
one or more ports. While the roles of port authorities in port
operations vary, most ports can be categorized as Operating Ports or
Landlord Ports. Operating Ports own and construct port facilities, own
cargo handling equipment, and hire labor to move cargo through port
premises. At these operating ports, stevedores hire dockworkers to move
cargo between ships and the dock. Landlord Ports, on the other hand,
own the land and wharves of a port and lease these premises to our
partners in the Marine Terminal Operator industry.
Our nation's seaports deliver vital goods to consumers, facilitate
the export of American made goods, create jobs, and support local and
national economic growth. Ports also play a crucial role in our
national defense--a point acknowledged through the designation of 18 of
our nation's ports as ``strategic seaports'' by the Department of
Defense.
According to Martin Associates \1\, an internationally recognized
economic and transportation consulting firm, the total economic value
generated in terms of revenue to businesses, personal income and
economic output at U.S. coastal ports accounted for $5.4 trillion,
roughly 26 percent of GDP. This research also showed over 30.8 million
Americans are employed in jobs generated because of port activity.
Ports also generate significant tax revenue, with $47.1 billion of
direct, induced, and indirect federal, state and local tax revenue
created through the economic activity taking place at ports across the
nation. AAPA is currently conducting an updated Economic Impact Study
and will share the results of the Study with the House Committee on
Transportation & Infrastructure when it is completed in the spring of
2024.

Congress must unite in a bipartisan effort to reaffirm its
commitment to this promise. Let us work together to ensure the timely
passage of WRDA, not just for the benefit of Port Tampa Bay, but for
every port, every state, and every citizen who relies on the seamless
flow of goods and services that our ports facilitate.
Thank you for your time, your consideration, and your pivotal role
in shaping the future of our nation's trade and infrastructure. It was
an honor to have the opportunity to speak to you today.

Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Mitamura.

TESTIMONY OF DAVE MITAMURA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL WATER
SUPPLY ALLIANCE

Mr. Mitamura. Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano,
and distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for
the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss
stakeholder priorities for WRDA 2024.
Thank you also for your commitment to maintaining the
biennial, bipartisan WRDA process, which is crucial--crucial--
to maintaining and improving our Nation's water infrastructure.
My name is Dave Mitamura, and I serve as the executive
director of the National Water Supply Alliance. NWSA is a
national not-for-profit organization representing water supply
providers across the country who work every day to meet the
Nation's growing water supply needs.
Our members have a direct and substantial interest in the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Water Supply Program or depend
upon storage space in Corps reservoirs to meet the needs of the
communities they serve.
Our members advocate for the preservation and enhancement
of the Nation's water supply, protect traditional State
authorities, and ensure that water supply interests share
equitably in the benefits of multipurpose reservoir projects.
I, personally, have worked either with or for the Corps for
over 20 years. Throughout my career and especially in my role
at NWSA, I have seen firsthand the value that comes from open
communication and direct engagement with the leadership and
staff at the Corps.
Under the leadership of Lieutenant General Scott Spellmon,
the Corps has developed a strong working relationship with us.
A dedicated Corps water supply team regularly attends NWSA
meetings, actively participating in candid debates and
collaborative discussions as we work to refine and improve the
Corps program.
We appreciate this transparency and collaboration, but more
can be done. Our Nation faces significant and evolving water
supply challenges. Our infrastructure is aging, our populations
are growing, and we are experiencing droughts of increasing
severity, frequency, and duration.
Additional priority and resources dedicated to water supply
are desperately needed and overdue. NWSA believes that, with a
few tweaks, the Corps can be better equipped to bolster its
water supply efforts in support of regional, State, and local
partners.
This subcommittee is well-informed on the expanse of the
Corps water supply portfolio. I won't belabor the statistics.
My written testimony includes several data points on the Corps'
impact on water supply. They are significant and meaningful.
Under the current and mounting challenges facing water
supply in the U.S., the Corps' Water Supply Program can and
should play a more active and significant role in addressing
the needs of the Nation. Yet, still, water supply remains a
relatively low priority within the Corps. The Corps' Water
Supply Program receives only a tiny fraction of the budget and
staff as compared to other mission areas.
As a result, water supply studies take many years, even
decades, to complete. Some studies never even make the cut due
to the lack of priority. I have provided examples of this lack
of focus in my written testimony.
NWSA recommends that the subcommittee consider ways to
increase the priority given to water supply within the Corps so
the emphasis is more commensurate with its importance to the
Nation. Put plainly, agencies focus on the missions prescribed
to them by Congress.
NWSA also recommends that the subcommittee seek new ways
for State and local partners to collaborate with the Corps--for
example, allowing studies led by non-Federal partners,
optimizing storage for water supply as appropriate, and
modernizing operations to adapt, such as water conservation.
Given our Nation's water supply needs, we cannot wait
decades to take water supply studies from authorization to
completion, and we certainly cannot deny opportunities to start
such studies. We must find ways to prioritize water supply and
to evaluate needs and implement solutions more quickly if we
are to meet the challenges to come.
Thank you, Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, and
members of the subcommittee, for your hard work developing the
Nation's water resources infrastructure. NWSA looks forward to
working with the subcommittee as it develops WRDA 2024.
[Mr. Mitamura's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Dave Mitamura, Executive Director, National Water

Nation's water infrastructure.
My name is Dave Mitamura, and I serve as the Executive Director of

represent communities across the Nation, from the East Coast to the
West Coast and from North Dakota to Texas. We seek to give water supply
providers across the country a unified voice to advocate for the
preservation and enhancement of the Nation's water supply, and the
protection of traditional State authorities, and to ensure that water
supply interests share equitably in the benefits of multipurpose USACE
reservoirs.
I have worked either with or for USACE for over 20 years.
Throughout my career, and especially in my role as the Executive
Director of NWSA, I have seen first-hand the value that comes from open
communication and direct engagement with USACE leadership and staff.
Under the leadership of LTG Scott Spellmon, USACE has developed a
strong working relationship with NWSA. The USACE water supply team
regularly attends NWSA meetings, actively participating in
collaborative discussions and candid debates with our members as we
look for ways to work together more directly and effectively.
This transparency and collaboration are both appreciated and
necessary, but more can be done. Our Nation faces significant and
evolving water supply challenges. Our infrastructure is aging. Our
populations are growing. And we are experiencing droughts of increasing
severity, frequency, and duration. We and our federal partners must
become more nimble and more adaptable. Additional priority and
resources dedicated to water supply are desperately needed and overdue.
We must also look for new and creative mechanisms for state and local
interests to collaborate with USACE to advance needed water resource
projects. Only through a real partnership involving all levels of
government, affected communities, as well as the private sector--and
through the integration of new and existing water storage projects into
our Nation's water supply systems--will we succeed in meeting the
challenges of today and tomorrow.
This afternoon, my remarks will focus on how to strengthen this
relationship in service of our Nation's water supply. NWSA believes
that, with a few tweaks, USACE can be better equipped to bolster its
water supply efforts in support of regional, state, and local partners.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Reservoirs are a Critical Component of the
Nation's Water Supply Infrastructure
While water supply is and should remain a State and local
responsibility, storage space in federal reservoirs operated by USACE
is a critical part of our Nation's water supply system. According to
USACE, there are nearly 140 USACE reservoirs across the country with
storage space dedicated to municipal and industrial water supply.
Collectively, these reservoirs provide over eight million acre-feet of
dedicated water supply storage space and a firm yield to contracting
water providers exceeding six billion gallons per day. According to a
2017 report from the USACE Institute for Water Resources, the water
supply storage space in USACE projects is sufficient to meet the
household needs of approximately 100 million people.
The importance of USACE reservoirs as a source of water supply
storage will only grow. As communities and groups work to address
property, environmental, and budgetary challenges, maximizing the use
of this existing infrastructure, rather than constructing new
reservoirs with their attendant costs and environmental impacts, is
frequently the most environmentally sensitive and cost-effective means
to provide necessary storage space for water supply. While we recognize
that multiple purposes must be balanced, there is no better way to
maximize value to the Nation of the federal investment in reservoir
storage space than to utilize that storage for water supply purposes.
What is more, time after time, USACE studies have shown that
enormous water supply benefits can be achieved with little if any
effect on other authorized purposes. At Stockton Lake in Missouri, for
example, a partial flood-storage reallocation has been proposed that
would provide a badly needed regional water supply solution for
communities across southwest Missouri. Yet USACE's study shows this
reallocation would have ``no additional flood risk management impacts
or increased inundation downstream,'' while the value of system energy
would be reduced by just 0.53 percent.
As recent droughts in the West have shown, it is more important
than ever to have enough storage space to capture and store the water
we need when and where it is available. This requires us to identify
areas where storage space in USACE reservoirs can most effectively be
used to meet water supply needs; to provide USACE adequate resources to
commence and complete needed reallocation and feasibility studies; and
to advance those studies much more quickly than has occurred in the
past.
We must also look for ways to include water conservation as a
purpose of federal projects, and to more quickly adapt reservoir
operating rules to facilitate water conservation. The collaboration
between the Orange County Water District and USACE at Prado Dam in
California is an example of the water supply benefits that can be
achieved through water conservation operations. In simple terms, by
adjusting operations to add water conservation, USACE allows for
temporary use of the project's storage capacity for conserving
stormwater that would otherwise flow to the ocean. Releases from the
dam can be managed to allow water to be recharged into the Orange
County Groundwater Basin and provide a significant increase to water
supply availability--all in a way that maintains flood protection and
does not affect the primary purpose of flood risk management. The
Orange County Water District has recharged an average of 55,000 acre-
feet per year of stormwater--enough water for 440,000 people annually.
The majority of this groundwater recharge is directly tied to water
conservation at Prado Dam. These are low-cost, low-risk, and high
reward options to expand water supplies, and opportunities exist to
implement similar operational changes to facilities at other projects.
Those efforts can only succeed, however, if USACE has sufficient
resources to initiate and complete the necessary studies in a
reasonable period of time.
Importantly, state and local interests contracting for storage
space in USACE projects pay their own way. Under USACE policies
implementing the Water Supply Act of 1958, for example, water supply
users reimburse the U.S. Treasury for the updated cost of constructing
their storage space in today's dollars, or for any benefits that are
foregone due to their use, whichever is higher. They also pay their
share of annual operations and maintenance (O&M) and repair,
replacement, and rehabilitation (RR&R) costs incurred by the
government. Even putting aside the national benefits secure water
supplies provide, the USACE Water Supply Program yields substantial
returns on federal investments. During the 10-year period from 2007 to
2016, for example, USACE reports that district offices spent
approximately $10 million in total to administer water supply storage
contracts. In return, water supply users paid $650 million to the U.S.
Treasury for project investment costs, interest payments, and O&M
costs.
Challenges remain, however. Despite the significant benefits the
USACE Water Supply Program provides and the exceptional efforts of
dedicated USACE staff, water supply remains a relatively low priority
within USACE. The USACE water supply program receives only a tiny
fraction of the budget and staff devoted to other mission areas. As a
result, water supply studies take many years--even decades--to
complete. Some studies never even make the cut due to the lack of
priority. For example:

To meet growing demand for water in Colorado's Front
Range and on northeast Colorado farms, Congress authorized USACE to
study a reallocation of water supply storage space in Chatfield
Reservoir in the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. Eighteen
years later, in 2004, USACE published a notice of intent to prepare an
Integrated Feasibility Report/Environmental Impact Statement in the
Federal Register. And in 2014--nearly ten years after the notice of
intent was published and almost 30 years after the study was
authorized--the feasibility report was completed and a record of
decision approving the reallocation was signed.

At J. Percy Priest reservoir near Nashville, Tennessee,
water supply providers requested additional storage in 2008 to meet the
rapidly growing needs in the City of Murfreesboro and Rutherford
County--one of the fastest growing regions in the United States. Yet it
took twelve years for the Assistant Secretary to approve an
Environmental Assessment and authorize the requested reallocation of
storage.

In the White River Basin in Northwest Arkansas, water
supply demands are growing at an extraordinary rate and additional
water supply storage space is needed. However, water supply users have
been informed that all future water supply reallocation studies will be
placed on hold pending completion of a basin-wide watershed study--a
study that remains in its early stages and that will take years to
complete.

Section 7001 of WRRDA 2014 required USACE to submit an
Annual Report to Congress on feasibility reports and project
modifications to be considered for authorization under future Water
Resources Development Acts. Yet water supply projects have long been
excluded from consideration and relegated to the appendix on grounds
that water supply is not considered by USACE to be one of its primary
mission areas.

To be sure, study considerations and project timelines have been,
and will continue to be, affected by factors specific to each project,
and USACE staff have worked diligently using the resources available to
complete the studies discussed above. Nevertheless, these timelines are
not atypical for water supply studies at projects nationwide. And
denying water supply proposals in the Section 7001 report further
stymies the ability of water supply evaluations to proceed. Given our
Nation's water supply needs, we cannot wait decades to take water
supply studies from authorization to completion, and we certainly
cannot deny opportunities to start such studies. We must find ways to
evaluate needs and implement solutions more quickly if we are to meet
the challenges to come.
How Can the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Strengthen its Water Supply
Efforts?
As this Subcommittee crafts the Water Resources Development Act of
2024, NWSA asks that you consider ways to increase the priority given
to water supply within USACE, so the emphasis given to water supply
within the agency is more commensurate with its importance to the
Nation. Experience with other USACE program areas, such as ecosystem
restoration, has shown that mission priorities can and should evolve to
meet the Nation's changing needs. Simply put, all agencies and
organizations, USACE included, naturally emphasize and devote resources
to programs that fall within their priority mission areas, while less
attention and fewer resources are devoted to programs that do not.
Given our Nation's rapidly evolving water supply challenges--and the
enormous water supply benefits that can be realized through the use of
storage in USACE projects--it is time for USACE to recognize the key
role it plays in meeting the Nation's water needs and for resources to
be allocated accordingly.
Despite these challenges, USACE maintains the status quo when it
comes to the USACE water supply program. USACE often points out
Congress's recognition in the Water Supply Act that state and local
interests have ``primary responsibility'' for ``developing water
supplies for domestic, municipal, industrial, and other purposes . . .
'' We agree with this statement, but there is nothing inconsistent with
state and local control and growing the priority of water supply within
USACE. Planning to meet water supply needs is a state and local
responsibility, and states should always retain their traditional
authority to grant water rights and to allocate water among their
citizens. But, just as Congress recognized these core principles in the
Water Supply Act, it also emphasized ``that the Federal Government
should participate and cooperate with States and local interests in
developing such water supplies in connection with the construction,
maintenance, and operation of Federal navigation, flood control,
irrigation, or multiple purpose projects.'' What is needed is greater
facilitation and support from USACE.
We also ask that the Committee seek new and creative ways for State
and local interests to collaborate with USACE to move studies and
projects forward, including by allowing them to assist USACE in
completing the studies necessary to evaluate and approve requests for
water supply storage space. In other areas, Congress has recognized the
benefits that flow from allowing project sponsors to participate in
completing necessary environmental studies. For example, the 2023
Fiscal Responsibility Act directs all federal agencies to ``prescribe
procedures to allow a project sponsor to prepare an environmental
assessment or [Environmental Impact Statement]'' under the National
Environmental Policy Act. This has always been permissible, and some
agencies have used this process to expedite the preparation of NEPA
study documents, but other agencies have been unwilling to provide this
option to project sponsors--forcing Congress to step in and mandate
this common-sense option.
In the case of water supply, reallocation studies are the primary
means of determining whether storage space at USACE facilities should
be allocated to water supply. However, the timeline for USACE to
complete reallocation studies is often far too long due to a lack of
resources and focus. To address this, NWSA has developed a 2024 WRDA
proposal that would let non-federal partners conduct reallocation
studies, or parts of reallocation studies, which would be submitted to
USACE for review and evaluation. Under our proposal, studies would move
forward only after USACE and the non-federal partner have agreed on key
study parameters and assumptions. No study requirements would be
relaxed, and the studies would be just as rigorous. And, as with NEPA,
ultimate review and approval of any study would remain exclusively with
USACE. Yet real water supply benefits could be realized because non-
federal partners can prioritize and advance needed studies far more
quickly than USACE, letting water supply projects move from study to
implementation in a reasonable period of time.
Thank you, Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, and Members
of the Subcommittee, for your exceptional work to develop the Nation's
water resources infrastructure. I appreciate the opportunity to appear
before you to discuss the importance of water supply in the overall
USACE portfolio. NWSA looks forward to working with the Subcommittee as
it develops WRDA 2024.

Mr. Rouzer. Well, thank you all for your testimony.
I want to take a moment to welcome our newest member of the
subcommittee, Ms. Celeste Maloy, representing Utah's Second
Congressional District.
Welcome, Celeste. Glad that you are here, and I look
forward to having you on this subcommittee.
We will now turn to questions for the panel. I will
recognize myself for 5 minutes.
Mayor Batts, you talked a great deal in your testimony
about the situation there at Surf City. Can you give a little
bit of a history of the challenges that you have faced because
you have not gotten the renourishment dollars that you need,
for example, other things that need to be tended to that, from
a city perspective or a town perspective, that you have not
been able to do? Those type of items I think the subcommittee
would be interested to learn.
Ms. Batts. So, as far as things that we haven't been able
to do is moving forward with giving the residents the help,
safety, and welfare of having an established dune line
protecting our infrastructure, which is our water and our
sewer, our roads that are oceanfront, and protect not only our
oceanfront homes but all the homes behind it as well.
We have spent $14 million in tax dollars after Hurricane
Florence with a truck haul to temporarily shore up our
disappearing beach. We are in desperate need of this new
authorization for a Surf City-only project. The town requires
authorization of our coastal storm risk management project in
WRDA 2024.
Mr. Rouzer. Well, we will obviously continue to work on
this. I know how critically important it is. I remember
Hurricane Florence very, very well in 2018. I remember
Hurricane Matthew quite well from 2016. And it really does a
significant amount of damage.
Mitigation efforts are incredibly important in terms of
preventing property loss; helps to mitigate costs in the
National Flood Insurance Program, et cetera, et cetera. And so,
it has a real domino effect.
Mr. Anderson, I am going to switch to you quickly: supply
chain infrastructure. Infrastructure is so critically important
to the supply chain.
Can you talk about the need for a robust supply chain,
especially after the disruptions that took place with COVID-19,
and the nexus with WRDA projects?
Mr. Anderson. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Critically important to
our Nation is supply chain connectivity, freight corridors
connecting our gateway ports to the hinterland cargo movement.
It is also vitally important, as I mentioned in my
comments, that--and as most of the testimony today--for having
a predictable WRDA cycle that allows ports--in our case,
ports--but other water-related projects to be able to make the
investments and align those with other investments that create
freight capacity, freight velocity, and expansion for our
Nation's ports.
The most recent supply chain crisis was--most people agree
it was COVID. The demand went up; it exceeded our capacity.
There were some other issues. It is also up to the beneficial
cargo owners to diversify their supply chains and use other
ports. And we have seen that happen in the gulf. Gulf ports
have seen cargo move from west coast ports as some of the
companies are diversifying.
So, aligning the WRDA investments with strategic
investments into our freight corridors as well as diversifying
the supply chain are critical to preventing supply chain issues
that we have seen recently.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Weakley, you talked a good little bit about
the Great Lakes and their importance to our economy and
security.
Specifically, the 100-percent Federal--or, at least, the
idea that it ought to be 100 percent federally allocated, can
you elaborate a little more on that, that particular point in
particular?
Mr. Weakley. Yes, sir. To be clear, I am not talking about
all the navigation channels, just those five that we consider
systems resources or connecting channels. They connect our
different lakes--Lake Superior to Lake Huron, Lake Michigan to
Lake Huron, and Lake Huron to Lake Erie.
So, WRRDA 2014, the wisdom of this subcommittee, designated
the Great Lakes for the first time in history as a navigational
system. Before that, we were just a series of independent
ports. So, I think it is consistent with the systemwide
approach.
It is also consistent with the way that Soo locks are
treated as a system asset. There is not a non-Federal sponsor
for that project, sir.
Mr. Rouzer. Very good. Thank you.
My time has expired.
I now recognize Mrs. Napolitano.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Mitamura, how would the elevation of water supply and
water conservation added to the three primary mission areas of
the Corps be helpful in advancing authorized projects to
address local water scarcity issues?
Mr. Mitamura. First of all, Ranking Member Napolitano,
thank you for your focus on water supply. NWSA appreciates your
leadership.
As I said in my remarks, the time required to complete and
implement water supply studies and projects is a chronic
challenge, one made even more important based on the Nation's
rapidly evolving water supply needs. These delays often result
from a lack of resources and attention allocated to water
supply.
We believe the proposed legislation would help to elevate
the priority given to water within the Corps, encourage
flexibility inside the agency when it comes to water supply
projects and studies, and help make additional resources
available to Corps staff so they can move water supply projects
from the study to implementation more quickly.
Ultimately, we think this becomes a way for the Corps to
find a way to say ``yes'' when working on water supply issues
that are so critical to our Nation.
Mrs. Napolitano. Yes, sir.
Would this draft proposal preserve the primary
responsibility of States and local interests in managing local
water supply concerns?
Mr. Mitamura. Yes, it would. State and local interests
should always retain primary responsibility for meeting water
supply needs. The proposed legislation would not affect that.
Instead, it would help produce additional tools and
resources available to the Corps so the Corps can cooperate
with State and local interests in these important efforts,
consistent with longstanding congressional policy as stated in
the Water Supply Act of 1958.
The legislation is also very clear that it does not alter
or affect traditional State authorities to regulate the use and
allocation of water--something that is extremely important to
NWSA's members.
Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you.
And to the rest of you, thank you for your support of
WRDAs.
I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Webster, you are recognized.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you
for having this important meeting. Everybody loves ports;
everybody loves WRDA. So, thank you for doing that.
My question is for Paul Anderson.
As you know, the Army Corps is working on a general
reevaluation of the port for deepening Tampa Bay's shipping
channels, and a channel deepening project would allow ports to
accommodate larger next-generation ships. That has become sort
of the industry standard.
Can you elaborate on how the importance of channel
deepening projects in the Port of Tampa as well as the greater
area of Florida will benefit from these services?
Mr. Anderson. Yes, Congressman, the deepening project at
Port Tampa Bay is vitally important to be able to--just like we
talked about the cycle of WRDA being 2 years, having
predictability for funding, we have to be able to anticipate,
which we know is coming, larger ships into the Gulf of Mexico
that will be Asian services, in particular, coming to the
Panama Canal. We have seen those increase over time. The other
gulf ports are deepening, as well, and have deepened.
So, this will allow us to be able to handle the larger
vessels that we anticipate and know are coming in the future.
It creates a more efficient transportation system. It creates
more volume so that we can serve the incredibly growing market
in particular of the central Florida and Florida area where we
are seeing significant population growth. And it allows us to
work with our customers to be more efficient, drive cost down,
and create economic value for the citizens of our State and our
Nation.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Can you maybe discuss the
importance of timing, these close timing relationships, to the
Army Corps and their Chief's Report and all that can happen
from that? Could you give me a little breakdown on that?
Mr. Anderson. Yes, sir.
As I mentioned in my testimony, members of the
subcommittee, we have a Chief's Report in August of 2024. It is
going to be very close to any timing of a WRDA passage. And it
is really critical that we get that included in the next WRDA
so that we can continue that predictability for the incredible
growth, as I mentioned, and getting that in the next WRDA bill.
So, the timing is going to be a little tricky, and one of
my specific asks is that the subcommittee, the committee get
that included in next year's WRDA.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you very much.
I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Ms. Wilson.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you, Chair Rouzer and Ranking
Member Napolitano, for convening today's hearing.
In south Florida, water is woven into the fabric of our
daily existence. From the essential natural drinking water that
residents rely on, the sunny beaches that millions enjoy every
year, to the surrounding waters that shape our environment and
ecosystem, there is no question about the need to safeguard our
water and enhance our water infrastructure.
That is why, in my community, we are working to address the
critical needs of the Everglades, identifying the need to
replace hundreds of thousands of septic tanks that are
polluting communities, protecting our neighbors from storm
surges, and improving our ports so that we remain competitive
in the global maritime industry.
Through Federal, State, and local collaboration, we strive
to improve our water infrastructure and better utilize our
water resources. We can accomplish this by passing the Water
Resources Development Act of 2024.
While making these financial commitments, it is imperative
that we also work with our environmental stakeholders to ensure
that our decisions will help heal environmental shortfalls of
the past while building our future.
I want to take a moment to also highlight the bipartisan
nature of this bill. While our Nation often witnesses a
dysfunctional and partisan Congress, I am proud that we are
unified in our commitment to safeguard water resources. Because
our water is precious, and protecting it must be a priority.
With that, I have a few questions for the witnesses.
Mr. Mitamura, in south Florida, the Western Everglades
Restoration Project has been repeatedly delayed. As a result,
our local Tribal communities are now facing challenges with
excess water and agricultural pollutants.
Can you elaborate on how State and local interests can work
on delayed projects like the Western Everglades Restoration
Project?
Mr. Mitamura. I am sorry, Ms. Wilson. Can you restate that
question? I am not sure what you are asking as it relates to
water supply.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. In your testimony, you stressed the
importance of looking for new and creative mechanisms for State
and local interests to collaborate with USACE to advance needed
water resource projects.
Mr. Mitamura. Yes, that is correct.
So, one pushback we have received is that it would take
away from the other interests in the Corps program. But what we
are trying to do is elevate water supply to have equal footing.
And, ultimately, the Congress directs the Corps on how to parse
those pieces.
We are not trying to intrude or disrupt the programs that
are already in existence and have great needs as well as water
supply. So, we don't see a negative impact to the other
purposes, including ecosystem restoration.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you.
It is great to see another Floridian in the room,
especially one who is the chair of the American Association of
Port Authorities.
When I first came to Congress, the Water Resources
Development Act was not on a 2-year cycle, and my fellow
Floridian Congressman, Bill Posey, and I launched the
bipartisan Florida Ports Caucus to advocate for the restoration
of the 2-year cycle.
Can you elaborate on the significance of the 2-year Water
Resources Development Act cycle, or WRDA, as opposed to a 1-
year cycle to address the issues?
Mr. Anderson. I would be happy to. Thank you for your warm
welcome. And I want to, first of all, thank you for your
leadership on our Florida Ports Caucus, and I am looking
forward to our next meeting this spring.
The WRDA cycles, as we know it, and as this committee has
promulgated, successfully every 2 years. There was a period of
time, Congresswoman, where we went 7 years at one point. I
believe, maybe 20 years ago, a 5-year cycle. And it's just not
a way to do business for our Nation's ports.
I have mentioned it several times, but businesspeople will
tell you that predictability is very important. Our ports will
tell you.
My colleague, Hydi, who is the great leader of the Port of
Miami, we are very dependent on this committee and your
authorization process for the projects that we are planning to
expand our port capacity to stay competitive in the global
marketplace. And again, just one of the most important things
the committee can do is have that predictability. Thank you.
Ms. Wilson of Florida. Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. LaMalfa.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We have, in California, obviously great challenges with our
water supply and our ability to enhance that supply, whether it
is aboveground storage or underground groundwater.
So, Mr. Mitamura, thank you for being here today and for
your insight.
An example down in Orange County, with their water district
and Army Corps, they are working on a Prado Dam implementation
under SGMA. So, they are trying to enhance that situation there
to be able to have more storage, either groundwater or above
ground.
Of course, I have been a long-time advocate of building
more surface water storage in the Western States and, in my own
district, we have opportunities with what is called Sites
Reservoir in northern California and the raise of the Shasta
Dam, 18 feet, which, feasibility was being looked at just a few
years ago.
And also, the amount of water we are losing to the Pacific
with the opportunity--on any given month, with the rainfall and
snowpack melts, we might be losing anywhere between 77 and 95
percent of the water flowing from the watershed might be going
through the delta straight into the Pacific. And then somewhere
else along the line, they want to try and convert that now
salty water back into freshwater. Why don't we just catch it
before it leaves?
So, Mr. Mitamura, in addition to Army Corps--and we are
working with Mrs. Napolitano on looking at an idea on Army
Corps' scope of work, maybe expanding the storage. So, I hope
to work with her some more on that.
What are the Federal agencies that would have a role to
play so we can accelerate groundwater recharge and storage
projects? We lost some opportunity in this massive amount of
rain and snow we had last year with--the State water folks were
not ready to allow us to divert water into retention and
groundwater recharge ponds. We were waiting on permits in the
middle of the massive water flow.
So, what ideas do you have, sir, on--besides Army Corps?
Who can we get to be more helpful?
Mr. Mitamura. Representative LaMalfa, thank you for the
question. Your reference to Prado Dam is a good one. That is an
example of where the Corps has approved operations to allow
what is a flood control dam to capture water for groundwater
recharge in certain cases. Mrs. Napolitano's proposed
legislation would hopefully allow that to be more widespread.
I should also mention that our organization focuses on
Corps of Engineers projects. So, I am not totally familiar with
reclamation, but I would assume that those types of actions
could be done at other Federal reservoirs.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK. Well, we were going to talk previously in
another committee hearing on the 2014 WRRDA where there was a
section, 1043 pilot programs. There were two sections of it
that allow the non-Federal project sponsor to carry out the
feasibility studies for a project with the same standards as
the Corps would. It was intended to evaluate the cost-
effectiveness and project delivery efficiency. Section 1043(b)
allowed the non-Federal project sponsor to carry out the
construction of a project--again, with the same standards as
the Corps--in order to evaluate alternatives.
So, have you had any experience with these pilot programs,
Mr. Mitamura, and are you seeing that they are taking advantage
of them? Because we are going back to 2014 WRRDA, which, I have
got to say, this committee has been pretty good on getting with
the program on WRDA the last 10 years, and getting that back is
an important part of our process here.
So, any experience with the section 1043(a) or (b)
sections?
Mr. Mitamura. Absolutely. Allowing non-Federal sponsors to
take the lead on some of these studies helps not only produce
more efficiency in the process--in other words, time--and cost.
Mr. LaMalfa. Which is what we are after.
Mr. Mitamura. And I should add, though, that under the
Corps' interpretation, reallocation studies are not allowed
that same luxury. So, that is why this legislation proposed by
Mrs. Napolitano would help with reallocation studies as well.
Mr. LaMalfa. Yes. I hope we can iron that out.
So, would it be good to extend that authority to
reallocation and upgrading existing reservoirs? Quickly,
please.
Mr. Mitamura. I am sorry?
Mr. LaMalfa. Upgrading existing reservoirs. Would it be
good to extend the authority to that?
Mr. Mitamura. That is correct.
Mr. LaMalfa. OK.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Ms. Norton.
Ms. Norton. I thank the chair and ranking member for
holding this hearing on stakeholder priorities for the Water
Resources Development Act of 2024.
The District of Columbia, which I represent, is wholly
reliant on the Potomac River for its drinking water, but
natural or man-made events could render the river unusable for
drinking water. This poses a grave risk, both to the operations
of the Federal Government, and, of course, to DC residents.
The federally owned and operated Washington aqueduct
produces drinking water from the Potomac River for DC and parts
of Virginia, and maintains only a single day of backup water
supply.
To address this risk to the Federal Government and DC
residents, I included a provision authorizing the Army Corps to
conduct a feasibility study on a secondary drinking water
source and additional drinking water storage capability for the
District of Columbia in the Water Resources Development Act of
2022.
At our last water resources hearing, the Chief of Engineers
and Commanding General of the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, Lieutenant General Spellmon, indicated the Army
Corps supports funding 100 percent of the cost of the
feasibility study on a secondary drinking source and additional
drinking water storage capability for the District of Columbia.
Mr. Mitamura, do any other jurisdictions have multiple
water sources, and do you consider it a risk to the Federal
Government and the District of Columbia residents to have only
one drinking water source and only 1 day of backup water supply
for the Nation's capital?
Mr. Mitamura. Absolutely. The best managed water supply
sources have a diverse portfolio of sources to meet the needs
of their customers.
In this case, I don't know all the ins and outs of the
Washington system, but I do understand that, if it goes down,
the city would be without water for quite a long time. So,
making that a priority to not only find additional water
sources, but to prepare for any type of contingency, would be
wise, and I think Mrs. Napolitano's legislation would help
prioritize that type of issue within the Corps.
Ms. Norton. Thank you. And I will add that the Water
Resources Development Act of 2022 also included my provisions
authorizing studies of flood risk management in the Federal
Triangle area of the District of Columbia and recreational
access to the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers.
Storms in the Federal Triangle in 2018, 2019, and 2020,
resulted in closures of Constitution Avenue, power and
transportation disruptions, and floodings of buildings. With
heavy rain projected to become more frequent due to climate
change, this area is increasingly susceptible to flooding.
The project for flood risk management, including
construction of improvements to interior drainage in the
Federal Triangle, is vital to the Federal Government, given the
many key Federal assets located right there. As with the study
for a secondary drinking water source, we must consider the
Army Corps' funding 100 percent of this study.
DC's clean water project has dramatically reduced combined
sewer overflows into the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers. As a
result, bacterial levels are at a level that swimming in the
rivers may be safe some days now and regularly in the future.
The study for recreational access in the Potomac and Anacostia
Rivers would assess the safety of swimming in the rivers, which
would benefit residents of the DC area and visitors.
I yield back my time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Ezell.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Commissioner Anderson, thank you for joining us today.
And all our witnesses on here, it is very much appreciated
that you came out here and took this opportunity.
But, Mr. Commissioner, I want to thank you for your prior
service as a Federal Maritime Commissioner, and being a
freshman Member, I am glad to learn from some of your
experiences. It is clear that your past work gives you the
qualifications needed to provide effective leadership at one of
our Nation's major seaports.
Also, I believe it is obvious from your background in both
the public and private sectors, you truly understand the
importance of establishing the public-private partnership, or
P3, at our Nation's ports. Take, for instance, the one between
Ports America in the Port of Gulfport, which is in my district.
Before we get into the water projects, can you expand just
a little bit on the importance of the P3s and how it helps meet
the demands of maritime commerce?
Mr. Anderson. Yes. Thank you, Congressman. Very important
to ports is the ability to have effective public-private
partnerships. I am sure, again, my colleague at Gulfport, Jon
Nass, would agree.
Ports America is also our strategic operating terminal
partner, and as such, we do co-investing on much of our port
operating equipment. We have other P3s where we have had
private investors invest. We will invest in the land. They will
invest in the equipment. So, we improve the bulkheads, the
public-use facilities. We arrange for the business contract
that will allow them to be very profitable, hopefully, and
bring new businesses to our port and utilize the public asset
and throw off taxes, jobs, job creation.
So, it is critically important. I know in Gulfport, we also
have mutual customers in our refrigerated produce and other
products that we serve, and those in our port is a public-
private partnership. So, I would say they are extremely
important to ports around our Nation, your port, and my port as
well.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you very much.
I have got a bill which would incentivize some private
investment by expanding the use of the Capital Construction
Fund, or CCF, to allow port operators to upgrade their cargo
handling equipment without appropriating any funds.
Do you think this bill and similar ideas would give our
ports an additional resource needed to be more efficient and
provide other solutions, like some of the supply chain issues
that we have seen over the last couple years?
Mr. Anderson. Yes. We believe that would be very helpful
for ports. The WRDA bill expands the waterside infrastructure.
Your bill would allow ports to get the capital investment for
the operating equipment on the landside.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you. Another interesting point I noticed
in your testimony is the reference to the Nation's 18 strategic
ports. The Port of Gulfport is included in that list.
I am impressed at the work that is being done in south
Mississippi to advance technology, particularly in the maritime
drone industry. That will ultimately support our national
security as well.
These developers utilize the port's convenient access to
deep and shallow water in the gulf, and I hear from the
research community that deepening the port would provide even
more research benefits.
Do you agree that deepening a port, such as the Port of
Gulfport, would provide not only some better supply chain
benefits, but also benefit our national security, such as
increased R&D and training facilities?
Mr. Anderson. Well, Jon would be very upset if I said no.
Mr. Ezell. So would I.
Mr. Anderson. I absolutely agree. We are at Port Tampa Bay.
Although we are not under one of those 18 ports, they are
critical seaports to the strategic protection of our Nation.
Deepening those ports along with other ports so that we can
stay competitive in the global environment is very important.
Mr. Ezell. Do you believe the military research and
development, R&D, and training should be a determining factor,
as well, when the Corps reviews the benefits of dredging these
projects?
Mr. Anderson. Beneficial dredge materials--as I mentioned
in my testimony--are going to be used, and it is really a win-
win when you can use those--we like to say beneficial materials
instead of spoils because they are beneficial.
Mr. Ezell. Again, thank you all very much for being here
today and providing us with so much information.
And Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Ms. Maloy. Again, welcome to the subcommittee.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you all for being here.
I am hearing you talk about how essential it is that we do
WRDA on a 2-year cycle, and that the infrastructure is aging,
and Mr. Mitamura said in his testimony that agencies focus on
the missions given them from Congress.
I hear from my constituents all the time how difficult the
Army Corps of Engineers is to work with, because they don't
hear back from them. They are not super responsive. And the
Corps of Engineers' website for the 2022 WRDA has almost 200
provisions from the bill on there, but only 4 of them have
implementing guidance or anything tracking.
I am just wondering, for the whole panel, are you having
difficulties with implementation, and if so, what can we, as
Congress, do in the 2024 WRDA to make sure that agencies are
focusing on the mission Congress has given them?
Mr. Mitamura. Ms. Maloy, I would say that we have been
working very closely with the Corps staff on their water supply
team to make sure these delays don't continue. Now, that
doesn't mean we are not still seeing delays. We think working
directly with the Corps, in a good-faith manner, has helped us
to make some improvements, but across the board, I think folks
would agree that it is really not a timely process.
If you go back to past WRDAs, some of those provisions
still have not been implemented, or even have implementation
guidance, and I think the Corps needs resources to do some of
that. But in our case for water supply, making it a higher
priority would really help.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you.
Go ahead.
Mr. Weakley. I will go, ma'am.
I literally argued with the Army Corps of Engineers for 10
years, over a decade, on a flawed benefit-to-cost ratio at the
Soo locks. That is why that project languished from 1986 until
just the past couple of years.
It was critical that we overcame that obstacle. It was
critical that WRDA reauthorized it at the higher costs. But I
will say, once the Army Corps got their mission orders, once
WRDA authorized it, they are executing at this new Soo lock at
an incredible rate. I have nothing but tremendous respect and
appreciation for the project and the work that they are doing
at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.
But it took me 10 years to convince them that there was no
railroad connection between the mines and the mills, and there
was no alternative mode of transportation. But, like a good
Service, they salute, and I have tremendous respect for General
Spellmon personally and for the people that we work with in the
Detroit District and the Buffalo District in Chicago.
So, it is a matter of getting the ships set on the proper
course, and WRDA is the best way to do that.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you.
Mr. Kinne. I will just add similar to the other comments.
Historically, we have heard via the Kansas City District
and the Omaha District very similar sentiments to what your
constituents have shared with you.
I would echo other comments, though. Most recently,
communications have significantly increased and improved with
both districts as well as implementation. And I mentioned the
two big studies happening in our district, and I would say that
the Kansas City and Omaha District are doing significant public
outreach on those studies, and also have been very openminded
to our feedback and suggestions on how to improve--make that
outreach more effective.
At the end of the day, we will get to see how constituents
are listened to and how those studies come out, but we are
encouraged that they are at least taking the time to kind of
implement those studies in a way that they talk about the local
solutions being their priorities. So, that is positive to hear.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you.
Ms. Batts. Ms. Maloy, the Corps has been very good and a
wonderful partner to work with through our very long process.
We started our project over 20 years ago; 2014, we got
authorization; 2019, we got funded. The Corps was working on
this very diligently and continues to work on it, but we just
need the WRDA 2024 to make it a Surf City-only project. Thank
you.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you.
Mr. Anderson. And I would say that the WRDA process gives
the Corps the guidance that they need. That is why, every 2
years, it is so important. You can make tweaks, improvements.
Congress can direct what they want to do, and it doesn't let
them make their own interpretations in many cases. They have
improved under the 3x3x3 process. There is always room for
continuous improvement.
Ms. Maloy. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Ms. Scholten.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you so much.
I want to thank you for taking the time today. We are
coming to the end of our session, but nonetheless, these WRDA
reauthorizations are of critical importance, especially for
districts like mine. I represent Michigan's Third Congressional
District in Congress, which has miles of Lake Michigan
shoreline. It is essential for WRDA projects.
Water is a way of life in west Michigan. The Great Lakes
are a major economic engine, both in Michigan and throughout
our region, generating over $3 trillion in GDP and providing
jobs for over 25 million people.
Since water knows no physical boundaries, Congress must
work together to ensure that we continue maintaining and caring
for the vital resources of the Great Lakes for generations to
come.
My first question is for Mr. Weakley. As you are aware, the
Federal Government taxes maritime cargo, and those taxes are
then put into the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. In WRDA 2020,
we authorized that 13 percent of the Harbor Maintenance Trust
Fund should be allocated to the Great Lakes Navigation System,
which includes dredging efforts that keep harbor towns, such as
Grand Haven and Muskegon, thriving. Those are the two in my
district.
Can you please speak to whether those funds have, indeed,
been used for the Great Lakes Navigation System and whether the
percentage is still enough to keep up with the dredging efforts
that the Corps needs to continue?
Mr. Weakley.Yes, ma'am. Thank you for the question.
So, before we had the Great Lakes set-aside, but more
importantly, before the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund was
opened up, Congress would only appropriate 50 percent of what
was brought in, and that is why we have a $10 billion surplus.
So, those two changes have been instrumental in
resuscitating the Great Lakes Navigation System, particularly
when we see those western Michigan ports. They are vulnerable
to storm incidents, and we see a lot of littoral movement of
sand and sediment. So, it has been a game-changer.
What I worry about is the cost escalation of dredging,
particularly on the Great Lakes, with some of the management
material. It is what I call doing less with more. Doing less
dredging with more dollars. What we need to do is make sure the
project is more efficient.
Sometimes we will not dredge even post the 13 percent set-
aside to 3.3 million cubic yards of sediment. More often than
not, they are hitting that target, but we have seen years where
they haven't, and the backlog has gone from 18 million cubic
yards, and I believe it is probably down to the 15 million
cubic yards, but I would have to check with the Corps to get
you an exact figure, ma'am.
Ms. Scholten. OK. OK. You can get back to me on that.
I want to continue with you just a little bit talking
about, when proper dredging doesn't happen--you were
referencing it a little bit--but it prevent vessels from being
able to carry the loads that they were intended to carry, and
they have to go elsewhere, and it leads to light-loading. This
lack of efficiency when transporting goods is also worrisome
for the larger Great Lakes economy.
Can you please speak to the impact it would have
economically speaking, broadly, if these lakes and river
bottoms are not properly dredged?
Mr. Weakley. So, for each inch of lost navigation depth, we
lose 270 tons of cargo, and that is just a matter of the size
of our vessels. And in some instances, particularly before
WRRDA 2014, we were losing feet. So, it was a significant
economic loss systemwide.
The worst situation I can recall is Dunkirk, New York,
where the channels had gotten to the point where it was no
longer economical to move cargo, so, we were light-loading. And
the challenge there was we would do a split load, so, it would
go to Tonawanda, New York, and Dunkirk. Once Dunkirk
disappeared, Tonawanda was closed as a port.
And that is part of my fear, particular for some of the
Ohio ports, is that if we don't dredge them, they are not going
to be economical.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you. That was incredibly helpful.
My third question is for Mr. Mitamura. I understand that
you helped develop a three-State partnership between Texas,
Oklahoma, and Kansas to engage with the Army Corps of Engineers
on water planning, management, and policy issues.
Again, given that water knows no physical boundaries, can
you please speak to how important it is that we engage across
State lines under the WRDA authority?
Mr. Mitamura. Yes. Thanks for the question.
I was actually one of the members who initiated that
process, but it no longer exists. It requires a lot of
attention, coordination. But we did find results from the
Corps. The districts and divisions both participated on a
regular basis.
So, it does make a difference. The volume, the voices are
helpful, and Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas both benefited from
that relationship. And it is still ongoing today even though
the tri-States doesn't operate anymore.
Ms. Scholten. All right. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Westerman.
Mr. Westerman. Thank you, Chairman Rouzer and Ranking
Member Napolitano.
And, Chairman Rouzer, I hope you are working as well with
Ranking Member Napolitano as she worked with me when I was
ranking member and she was chair, and she has got a lot of
experience on WRDA. I think this is her last WRDA, so, we need
to make it a good one.
Thank you to the witnesses for being here today.
I have got an issue, and you may or may not be able to
address this, but it was brought to my attention by a retired
colonel from the Little Rock District who made me aware of some
archaic laws, and one of them happens to be with the Davis-
Bacon Act with a provision that was put in in 1931 that
requires contractors and subcontractors performing federally
funded or assisting contracting in excess of $2,000 to
competitively bid the work. So, they don't have any purchasing
authority for anything above $2,000 without going out for bids.
In practicality, that means if they have a backhoe and they
need to put a new set of tires on it, they have to
competitively bid it. So, it takes a lot of time and ends up
costing a lot of money.
And this isn't about changing any kind of prevailing wage.
It is just raising that limit to be able to do purchases
without competitively bidding. If you just used inflation, that
would be over $30,000, with what $2,000 was back in 1931. Not
even saying we need to raise it that high, but I think we
should use some common sense in that.
Also, the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act of 1965
requires service on prime contracts in excess of $2,500 to pay
service employees in various classes no less than the
prevailing wage. Again, not to mess with the prevailing wage,
but maybe look at some adjustment for inflation on that.
The bottom line is, I asked for a report just in the Little
Rock and Tulsa Districts over a 2-year timeframe. These two
provisions cost $18 million.
Are you familiar with this happening in other areas, or do
you think it would be a problem to adjust this or a benefit to
adjust it?
Mr. Weakley. I am not familiar, sir, but you sold me.
Mr. Westerman. When we are stretched for dollars and we
want the dollars to actually go towards projects, it seems to
be very common sense.
Mr. Anderson. Congressman, you used common sense as part of
it. I think we all agree common sense, in any law, makes sense.
And you said it was an archaic law, and no inflation adjustment
or what have you, but I would say it is very similar to the
challenges that we are facing with grants we receive. It is
taking several years to receive those dollars, and meanwhile,
the projects are getting serious inflation costs added to the
cost.
So, if there is common sense in how we deliver dollars or
how we do the--how we bid----
Mr. Westerman [interrupting]. Streamlining the permitting
would help lower costs as well.
Mr. Anderson. Streamlining the permitting would be very
helpful as well.
Mr. Westerman. There are a lot of opportunities to be more
cost-effective on our projects.
Shifting gears a little bit--and, again, this may be a
topic you may or may not be able to address--but I got the
chance to go with Ranking Member Napolitano and visit the ports
in California. I visited other ports across the country. And it
appears to me there is a demand for more ports on the west
coast, more deepwater ports on the west coast, and even some
deepwater ports on the west coast of Alaska.
But if anybody has got any knowledge to how beneficial it
would be for us to build new ports to be able to move our
goods, I would like to hear your thoughts on that.
Mr. Anderson. Well, if you saw the west coast ports--and
Mrs. Napolitano's port is a great port in Los Angeles and Long
Beach, that port complex.
I would be remiss if I didn't say we are here to focus on
increasing and improving our existing port complexes. I can't
imagine what it would require. Some of the projects--the WRDA
projects--some of our ports are facing due to excessive
environmental review, lengthening the process of their GRR
studies, building a new port would seem almost impossible to
me.
But we would strongly advocate for investing in our
existing ports.
Mr. Westerman. I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. James.
Mr. James. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member
Napolitano. I appreciate this opportunity to speak.
I would like to thank the witnesses for being able to make
it up to Capitol Hill today to testify in front of the
committee regarding the state of clean water infrastructure.
Today, we gather with the shared understanding of the
critical importance of preserving and safeguarding our precious
water resources. Among the jewels of our national heritage, the
Great Lakes system and the interconnected beauty of Lake Saint
Clair stand as vital components of our environmental legacy.
As only one of the many stewards of the Great Lakes, it is
our collective responsibility to champion the protection of
these majestic bodies of water and ensure they thrive for
generations to come. These interconnected bodies of water not
only form the bedrock of our environmental heritage, but also
serve as economic linchpins for countless communities.
The Nation's aging water infrastructure is in desperate
need of modernization. It is going to take significant
resources and our collective effort to make this happen.
Mr. Weakley, you mentioned your advocacy for the Soo locks.
I want to thank you. My very first bill that passed the House
was H.R. 3399, the Soo Locks Security and Economic Reporting
Act, this summer.
The DHS came out with a report in 2015, which identified
the fact that, due to 90 percent of the world's iron ore coming
through the Soo locks, a shutdown for any reason would result
in economic depression in the United States, and within 6
months, we would lose over 11 million jobs. The economic impact
to the State of Michigan would be incalculable.
The Soo locks has 7,000 ships and vessels pass through
annually, and it is widely referred to as the linchpin of the
Great Lakes. I would like to speak with you about not just how
the Soo locks--but as a part of the network, I am very
concerned about navigation. I do want to put this to listen.
Are there any specific regulations or policies that Great
Lakes carriers believe could be revised or improved to better
support the Great Lakes growth and sustainability?
Mr. Weakley. That is a very difficult and broad question,
sir. And I would say that I----
Mr. James [interrupting]. Intentionally broad because we
need you to educate us.
What can we go after to make the Great Lakes more clean and
make it easier for economic and environmental sustainability?
Mr. Weakley. So, I do give the Corps a lot of credit for
their executing on the Soo lock project, and I thought your
bill was well-placed, particularly with the cyber threat. I
think that is something that is underanticipated in
infrastructure. Infrastructure is key. It is part of what keeps
our economy moving, and I always say transportation is the
grease that keeps our economy moving.
I think there are opportunities to streamline some of the
permitting process. I think another key is focusing on dealing
with the dredge material management, particularly in some of
our Lake Erie ports. There are challenges of dealing with it
and complying with some of the State requirements.
And as I mentioned to an earlier question, I worry about
doing less with more. As the Congressman previously talked
about, the 1930s act, efficiency is a big deal. We have got a
$10 billion surplus, which sounds like a lot of money, but when
you look at, nationwide, how that can be used on----
Mr. James [interrupting]. Mr. Weakley, how can we be more
efficient at dredging?
Just in the past few months, there was an incident--I
believe in November, there was a stuck ship carrying wheat in
the Detroit River. Six months, I think there was another one on
May 17. It ran aground just feet from the Belle Isle shoreline.
And over--I think the Mark W. Barker was carrying salt from
Milwaukee coming on this side. And we seem to have these
recurring themes of ships running aground. We haven't even
gotten to the point of icebreakers in the winter months and
navigation.
Can you talk to us about how we can speed up and make the
process more efficient on dredging? And then if we have time in
the last minute, talk about how ice may be a factor in
navigation in the Great Lakes.
Mr. Weakley. So, I think another way to make dredging more
efficient is to broaden the dredging windows. There are
challenges, particularly with some of the State permits that
are based, in my opinion, on some questionable science. So, we
need to make it more efficient so that they have a larger
window with which they can use their existing capital
equipment.
I think what we saw in the State of Michigan is a perfect
example. When the State of Michigan was paying for the
dredging, the situation was so bad they were dredging
recreational harbors with State money, they waived and expanded
those dredging windows.
So, the States are more frugal with the State money than
they are with Federal money, and I think that is a challenge
that could be addressed, sir.
Mr. James. Thank you. I will follow up with you offline. I
appreciate your time here, sir.
Mr. Weakley. I was hoping you were going to get to
icebreaking. I apologize for talking too long.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Babin.
Dr. Babin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And thank you, witnesses, for being here.
I represent the 36th Congressional District of Texas,
basically Houston over to Louisiana, where we have many
critical ports and waterways, really an unmatched number of
chemical plants and refineries, and a number of communities
that are very, very sensitive to natural disasters. We are no
strangers to hurricanes.
I would like to thank you all of you for your commitment to
protecting and improving our Nation's water resources and our
infrastructure.
Just like many of you in your respective roles, my district
relies heavily on the Army Corps of Engineers. One key issue I
hear from constituents and community leaders is on the
communication with the Army Corps. My constituents pay close
attention to how projects might impact their communities and
quality of life, so, naturally, when we are trying to help
coordinate between the Army Corps and our constituents, we
encourage them to leave no stone unturned and listen very
closely to their concerns.
And this question is going to be open to all of you, if you
feel like you can answer. Do you feel like your engagements and
conversations with the Army Corps are well received and heard?
And when you have concerns with the way things are being done
and flag these concerns with the Corps, do you feel like that
your concerns result in some changes? If you would like to take
a stab at it.
Mr. Kinne.
Mr. Kinne. Yes, I am happy to start. I think we have a
fairly recent example of kind of how to answer that question
for you.
Dr. Babin. Sure.
Mr. Kinne. As I mentioned to the committee, we have two
kind of historic generational studies happening on the Missouri
River in regard to flood control, as well as navigation, and
those studies include a significant amount of stakeholder
engagement and outreach and comment.
And the Kansas City and Omaha Districts have done a very
good job of setting up those meetings, but as you all know, I
am sure as you go talk to constituents, sometimes getting
public input at a meeting can be challenging, and getting folks
to talk and give real substantive feedback can be challenging
as well.
And so, I will say, as we observe these meetings, we have
given feedback to the Corps of Engineers on how to better
facilitate them, on how to break them up and have smaller
meetings so individuals are willing to talk, and items like
that. And I will say, they have been responsive to that
feedback and have made adjustments in working with us to
facilitate those types of discussions.
And so, that would be kind of my feedback and suggestion.
Dr. Babin. OK.
Mr. Kinne. Just urging them to facilitate those in those
ways.
Dr. Babin. Thank you very much.
And as Representatives in Washington, we are tasked with
representing the various constituents, stakeholder, community,
and advocacy groups in our home States and our districts, and
obviously, we receive a lot of request for assistance.
And I am sure I am speaking for everyone sitting up there
where you are, we try our best to do everything we can to
improve our water resources, our storm preparedness, flood
resilience, et cetera.
Would some of you please share some best practices for
working with congressional offices? What sort of tips,
suggestions, recommendations, et cetera, do you have for both
other stakeholders and congressional offices working to put
together strong WRDA bills?
Who'd like to take a stab at that?
Mr. Anderson.
Mr. Anderson. I will take that or attempt to.
I think it is really important, communication. And in our
case, we have probably had 20 Members of Congress visit our
port in the last year. It is very important for us to--we can
show you slides and show you videos, but there is nothing that
beats showing somebody in person what the port is.
And to that end, I invite any member of the committee to
come down and visit in Tampa in January when it is really nice,
and we will show you our port. I think that is really
important, though, the communication aspect, and working as a
team.
Going back to your previous question, many times, you on
this committee and other Members--Mr. Webster was here
earlier--there have been many Members--are very helpful in
getting the communication to the Corps unstuck. So, thank you
for that.
Dr. Babin. You are welcome. And I thank all of you for your
service. I am looking forward to continuing our collaboration
on WRDA projects to improve our Nation's water resources.
With that, I will yield back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
Mr. Rouzer. Mr. Duarte.
Mr. Duarte. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you to the panel for being here today. I appreciate
you being available to advise us a bit.
I represent a district in the San Joaquin Valley of
California where we were, just last year and seemingly every
couple of decades, threatened with torrential flooding, and
there have been a lot of challenges in our district with
siltation and channel flow capacities.
I know Mr. Mitamura has worked on water supply issues in
the past. Our channel flow actually relates directly to our
water supply in that all of our reservoirs need to keep head
space in them for flood emergency events.
I will start with Mr. Mitamura, but I will take volunteers.
How can we best use this WRDA bill to get the dredging we
need executed in as near term as possible--on Army Corps time,
anyway--to increase our flood channel flow and hopefully
increase our dam storage carryover capacities?
Mr. Mitamura. Yes. Very good question.
In the past, the Corps has probably put less focus on
dredging those types of channels and making sure our reservoirs
are not silting up. The State of Kansas actually took it upon
themselves to do the dredging at their reservoirs because they
couldn't wait for the Corps.
I think the Corps is starting to pay more attention on that
issue. Maybe it needs a little bit more of a nudge. But in your
case, the issue is so much more urgent that--going directly to
the Corps, to the Chief, to get some attention on that.
I think--I am just assuming here--that, generally, that is
not something that is top of mind for the Corps----
Mr. Duarte [interposing]. Sure.
Mr. Mitamura [continuing]. Unless it's at a port.
Mr. Duarte. Thank you.
Other input on that? Because I have got other questions.
Mr. Anderson, I understand in a past life you worked for
the Corn Growers Association representing farmers. Is that the
case?
Mr. Anderson. No.
Mr. Duarte. It is not? Oh, I am sorry. Glad I doublechecked
that.
Mr. Kinne. That was me, sir.
Mr. Duarte. That was you. OK. Mr. Kinne down there. Sorry.
I misplaced that. You did. It is not an accusation.
I live in California, and much of my district has what are
called vernal pools. I know in many corn-growing and crops
areas in America, we have great prairie potholes. These have
been distinctly excluded from the Army Corps of Engineers'
jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act.
Do we still see the Army Corps of Engineers being
distracted around the country with minor wetlands and things
that are not clearly navigable waters of the United States and
adjacent as defined by the recent court decisions? And how
would you advise that we direct the Army Corps to focus on the
many important things they could be doing that are
jurisdictional, and away from harassing farmers?
Mr. Kinne. Yes. As I think about this issue, we have,
obviously, several members of our organization that are
concerned about this topic, and it does continue to be a
concern, especially as you think about WOTUS and that
regulatory focus.
I will say--and I think it was mentioned previously--as you
think about directing the Corps of Engineers to focus on
priority projects, passing a WRDA every 2 years is a critical
tool. It gives them that direction to focus them accordingly.
I think it was mentioned earlier. The more time that passes
between WRDA bills, the more----
Mr. Duarte [interrupting]. Bring that microphone a little
closer to you.
Mr. Kinne. Yes. The more time that passes between WRDA
bills, the more gap there is for interpretation of
implementation and things like that.
Mr. Duarte. Thank you very much.
In any of your expertise, are there specific pieces of
language we can put in this WRDA bill that direct the Army
Corps of Engineers away from isolated wetlands and towards the
navigable waters issues that are so important to so many
districts around the U.S.?
Mr. Kinne. Yes. One of our priorities in WRDA 2024 is
focused on sideboards around habitat projects for the Missouri
River. And so, historically, these experiments within the river
channel have had a significant impact on industry while not
knowing whether there is a positive benefit for the species or
not, and so, we are very focused on increasing those sideboards
to ensure that, if any type of endangered species acts are
happening within the river, that human interests and industry
interests are strongly considered in a way that is a part of
that process.
Mr. Duarte. Thank you.
And, Mr. Anderson, any quick advice you can give me on
getting private operators to take care of some of the port
dredging and siltation issues around the country?
Mr. Anderson. In our case, we have private terminals that
connect to public waterways, Federal channels, and in those
cases, when we do dredging projects, we will include those--can
include those with tipping fees, so that the revenue--because
as it connects to the Federal channel, up to that point, it has
to be paid for by the private companies, and that regularly
happens where we do have private terminals off the public
waterways.
So, that's clearly a way that you can dredge non-Federal
channels and derive revenue from doing it to pay back the cost.
Mr. Duarte. Thank you.
I yield back.
Mr. Rouzer. The gentleman yields back.
Thank you all very much. I appreciate every single one of
our panelists being here today. A very helpful and informative
hearing.
I see no other Members that have not already been
recognized before us. That being the case, this will conclude
our hearing for today.
And again, I thank each of our witnesses for being here
with us.
The committee stands adjourned.

Statement of Torey Carter-Conneen, Chief Executive Officer, American
Society of Landscape Architects, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Grace
F. Napolitano
Introduction
Thank you Chairman Rouzer, Ranking Member Napolitano, and Members
of the House Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment for the
opportunity to provide written testimony on the Water Resources
Development Act (WRDA) and the valuable work the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) performs to improve our nation's navigable channels,
reduce flood and storm damage, restore aquatic ecosystems, and more.
The American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) applauds your
leadership in ensuring a biennial WRDA process to plan, design, and
implement USACE projects and studies to meet our nation's water
resources needs.
ASLA appreciates USACE's collaboration with landscape architects to
improve and safeguard our nation's water infrastructure, while also
addressing water quality and quantity issues, climate resilience,
biodiversity, public health, and equitable economic development.
Founded in 1899, ASLA is the professional association for landscape
architects in the United States, representing more than 15,000 members.
ASLA members span nationwide, with landscape architects representing
all 50 states and U.S. territories among ASLA's 49 chapters. ASLA
promotes the profession of landscape architecture and advances the
practice through advocacy, education, communication, and fellowship.
Landscape architecture encompasses the analysis, planning, design,
management, and stewardship of the natural and built environment
through science and design. The profession is broad in scale and scope,
with most practitioners focusing on designing water and stormwater
management infrastructure projects, multimodal transportation networks,
community master plans, and parks and recreation spaces.
Landscape architects often play a lead role in large public and
private projects that significantly impact public health, safety, and
welfare.\1\ The technical complexity of landscape architecture and its
impact on public health, safety, and welfare have led all 50 states and
the District of Columbia to license landscape architects. In addition
to meeting STEM education and experience requirements, candidates for
landscape architecture licensure pass a national registration exam--the
Landscape Architecture Registration Exam (LARE)--before they can be
licensed by the state boards of registration. This rigorous four-part
exam includes a section on Grading, Drainage, and Stormwater
Management, requiring candidates to demonstrate mastery of grading and
earthwork design considerations for small-to-large scale sites and
detailed site-specific circulation, including addressing design
alternatives, adherence to national codes, and more.

Landscape Architects Successfully Collaborate with the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers
As you are aware, Congress first enacted WRDA in 1974 to provide
policy and guidance to help strengthen our nation's water
infrastructure. The 1986 WRDA began to identify and authorize funding
for specific USACE civil works projects. Since its inception, WRDA has
been updated to allow USACE to move beyond constructing water
infrastructure projects that only address traditional irrigation,
navigation, and flood control issues. Today, USACE projects also focus
on numerous community concerns, including environmental protection,
climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts, biodiversity,
recreation \2\ economic development, and other community benefits.

Throughout the years, landscape architects have been collaborative
partners with USACE. The profession's STEM-focused education and
training with an emphasis in hydrology, geology, botany and
horticulture, engineering site design, water management, drainage, and
climatology \3\ has positioned landscape architects to be uniquely
qualified to collaborate on and lead USACE projects. From coastal
resilience to wetlands restoration, flood control, sea-level rise, and
more, landscape architects work with USACE to create and manage our
nation's critical water infrastructure. During USACE's Engineering With
Nature (EWN) Podcast, Dr. Jeff King, deputy national lead of the EWN
program, discussed how landscape architects have joined forces with
USACE to explore innovative solutions to coastal resilience.\4\

Recently, landscape architects, firms, and university programs have
contracted and collaborated with USACE on cutting-edge projects and
research to help manage our nation's water infrastructure:

Landscape architecture faculty at the University of
Virginia are collaborating with USACE to study several sites in the
Chesapeake Bay to find ways of stopping or mitigating the damage from
changing environments and ecosystems. The research team will help
develop methods of evaluating the performance of nature-based efforts,
tracking characteristics such as vegetation growth patterns, indicator
species, and plant health.\5\

USACE contracted with Biohabitats, a landscape
architecture and design-build firm in Baltimore, Maryland, to provide
ecosystem restoration and environmental services to support the Great
Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) within the Buffalo, Detroit, and
Chicago Districts. Launched in 2010, the GLRI was designed to
accelerate efforts to protect and restore the health of the Great
Lakes, the largest system of fresh surface water in the world. The GLRI
supported projects to restore habitat and wetlands, clean up toxic
pollution, combat invasive species, and prevent runoff from farms and
cities.\6\

These are just a few examples of the myriad projects that highlight
the unique role landscape architects play in collaborating with USACE.
ASLA Recommendations for the Water Resources Development Act of 2024
1. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers should enhance the use of nature-
based solutions in its water resources projects.
Nature-based solutions are infrastructure that uses, restores, or
emulates natural ecological processes and can be created by human
design, engineering, and construction to act in concert with natural
processes.\9\ Examples of nature-based solutions include living
shorelines, green roofs, tree canopies, rain gardens, bioswales,
retention basins, and permeable and pervious pavements.\10\ A USACE-
sponsored report highlighted that nature-based solutions \11\ may
incorporate natural landscapes such as beaches, dunes, wetlands, reefs,
and islands.\12\ Nature-based solutions can provide sustainable, cost-
effective, and resilient alternatives or complements to traditional
gray infrastructure, which typically includes structures like buried
pipes, sewers, and tunnels made of concrete or steel.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ In recognition that the term natural infrastructure is related
to nature-based solutions as used or agreed to by the U.S. government
as found in Public Law 117-58, Section 11103 (Nov. 15, 2021) (codified
at 23 U.S.C. 101(a)(17)); https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-

\11\ In recognition that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers utilizes
the terms natural and nature-based features to describe nature-based
solutions as found in Todd S. Bridges et al., ``International
Guidelines on Natural and Nature-Based Features for Flood Risk
Management,'' September 15, 2021, https://doi.org/10.21079/11681/41946.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Traditionally, USACE and other infrastructure builders have looked
solely to gray infrastructure to create our nation's water
infrastructure projects. Generally, buried pipes, pump systems, sewers,
and tunnels have successfully rerouted waters to manage stormwater,
prevent flooding, address sea-level rise, and more. However, water
infrastructure projects that incorporate nature-based solutions are
known to be highly effective at managing water and simultaneously
create multiple community-wide benefits that impact environmental,
human, and economic health.\13\

Roadmap for Climate Progress, Thriving Nature, Equity, and
Prosperity,'' November 2022. https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/
uploads/2022/11/Nature-Based-Solutions-Roadmap.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Water infrastructure projects that incorporate vegetation or
organic material such as seagrasses, mangrove forests, and floating
ecosystems can also help to mitigate climate impacts and poor air
quality through carbon storage and sequestration. Additionally, these
projects can create or restore habitats and ecosystems that conserve
and increase biodiversity while also improving community aesthetics.
Nature-based solutions also improve human physical and mental
health. Green spaces provide environments for physical activity, which
helps prevent cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and other chronic
diseases. Nature-based solutions also improve air quality, which in
turn may help prevent asthma and other lung conditions. These green
spaces have also been shown to help reduce stress and address mental
health issues.
Communities may also reap economic benefits from recreational and
tourist-focused water projects that utilize nature-based solutions,
such as parks, managed shorelines, beaches, and more. Overall economic
growth can increase through jobs, tourism, and recreation opportunities
such as wildlife viewing, sportfishing, fishing, swimming, beach-going,
and boating.\14\ The use of nature-based solutions in USACE's Missouri
River Recover Program--which used levee setbacks to reconnect
floodplains--provided co-benefits including ecosystem sustainability,
increased recreational opportunities, improved aesthetics, and enhanced
cultural and educational opportunities.\15\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Acknowledging the benefits of nature-based solutions in water
projects, USACE introduced its EWN initiative in 2010 to highlight
current and future capabilities for delivering nature-based
solutions.\16\ EWN is the intentional alignment of natural and
engineering processes to efficiently and sustainably deliver economic,
environmental, and social benefits through collaboration.\17\ Since its
inception, EWN has been successfully implemented to guide the planning,
design, and construction of numerous USACE projects.\18\ The Oyster
Reef Shoreline Stabilization Project at MacDill Air Force Base is one
example of EWN's success and shows the need for increased nature-based
solutions. In this project, a living shoreline made of oyster reefs was
constructed to restore natural coastal vegetation, reduce wave energy,
and encourage sediment accumulation that stabilized the shoreline,
protected it from erosion, improved water quality, and enhanced habitat
for wildlife.\19\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further, due to mounting evidence demonstrating the effectiveness
of nature-based solutions and the numerous co-benefits, the Biden
administration introduced its Nature-Based Solutions Roadmap in
November 2022, calling on federal agencies to prioritize these
techniques in confronting our nation's most pressing challenges.\20\

uploads/2022/11/Nature-Based-Solutions-Roadmap.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given the documented effectiveness of nature-based solutions, the
ongoing success of EWN, and the administration's Roadmap
recommendations, ASLA believes that WRDA 2024 is a unique opportunity
to call on USACE to expand its use of nature-based solutions.
Specifically, ASLA recommends that all new studies on the feasibility
of USACE projects include consideration of nature-based solution
alternatives or compliments. Further, Congress and USACE should
prioritize the authorization and funding of projects beyond the
feasibility phase that have successfully planned and designed for the
implementation of nature-based solutions.
2. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers should work to include more
landscape architects in its water resources projects.
During a December 5, 2023, hearing before the House Water Resources
and Environment Subcommittee, the Honorable Michael L. Connor,
Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works at the United States
Department of the Army stated, there is a ``need to have the next
generation of skilled laborers in place'' to handle projects concerning
flood control and mitigation and coastal resilience.\21\ Because of
landscape architects' long-standing expertise in planning and designing
resilient water projects, ASLA urges Congress and USACE to take steps
to utilize more of the profession for the successful delivery of these
projects.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since at least 1857, landscape architects have been designing with
nature.\22\ Using plant and soil systems, wetlands, tree canopies,
green and open spaces, and more, landscape architects harness the power
of nature to manage stormwater, mitigate flooding, prevent coastal
erosion, clean our waterways, and address other water resource needs.
These and other nature-based solutions may be implemented at many
scales, from individual residences, to a neighborhood, to a community,
and to an entire region.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Landscape architects are particularly astute at addressing water-
related issues on a watershed scale, instead of ``one off'' project-
specific solutions. Landscape architects deploy holistic nature-based
solutions like upstream wetlands and forest restoration to manage
downstream flooding and erosion, as opposed to or in concert with gray
infrastructure flood walls, dikes, river channel modifications, and
others. Since water is by nature a dynamic force, failure to
holistically consider the constant flow and cycle of water between
individual project sites leaves communities increasingly susceptible to
floods, droughts, and polluted bodies of water.\23\

Philanthropy, February 15, 2023, https://disasterphilanthropy.org/
disasters/jackson-mississippi-water-crisis/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further, landscape architects are leaders in community engagement
processes that help build support for the project and lead to designs
that meet the needs of diverse groups of residents and stakeholders.
Conventional ``check-the-box'' models of engagement often fail to reach
and build trust with individuals in the community, especially those who
are underserved and often overlooked in design or policy
considerations.\24\ In contrast, landscape architects account for the
human experience when designing public projects and implement
innovative forms of public engagement that are ``contextual, open,
experiential, substantive, and holistic.'' \25\ Elevating community
voices is critical because lives are directly affected by projects.\26\

The design of WRDA projects must begin to utilize a comprehensive
approach that values the interconnectedness of water systems,
communities, and infrastructure. As such, landscape architects with
their holistic design approach and unique community engagement skills
are much needed on USACE projects.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers should recruit and hire
additional landscape architects to meet the growing
demands of designing and constructing water
resources projects.
As you know, Section 8116. Workforce Planning of WRDA 2022 \27\
called for the recruitment of individuals for careers at USACE. The
section further allows USACE to enter into partnerships with colleges
and universities, including historically Black colleges and
universities (HBCUs), to help with recruiting efforts.

www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ263/PLAW-117publ263.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given the holistic design skills, community engagement techniques,
and expertise in utilizing nature-based solutions for water resources
projects, ASLA encourages USACE to take aggressive steps to recruit and
hire landscape architects. ASLA has learned from its members that,
while some USACE district offices have multiple landscape architects on
staff, most district offices have few or no landscape architects,
resulting in inconsistent processes, approaches, and efficiencies in
project delivery. Congress should provide sufficient appropriations and
other resources to allow USACE to increase the number of landscape
architects in its workforce, thereby ensuring well-designed projects
that manage water resources and meet the concerns of the hosting
community.
Further, ASLA strongly encourages USACE to partner with the 102
landscape architecture programs at 76 universities and colleges across
the country, including the HBCUs North Carolina Agricultural and
Technical State University and Morgan State University, to help
develop, recruit, and hire landscape architects to work with the
agency. Landscape architecture students are educated in and routinely
apply the physical and natural sciences, including site design, land
planning, grading, drainage, stormwater management, hydrology, erosion
control, and more,\28\ making them uniquely qualified to immediately
contribute to the success of USACE.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers should incorporate
landscape architecture in calls for Indefinite
Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.
The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is the primary regulation
used by all executive agencies to acquire supplies and services.\29\
Governed by the FAR, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)
contracts--most often used for architect-engineering services--are used
when the exact quantities of supplies or services the government will
require during the contract period cannot be determined at the time of
contract award.\30\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASLA has heard from its members that many USACE IDIQ solicitations
do not always include a specific call for landscape architects when the
requested services fall squarely within the scope of work for the
profession. During the solicitation process, USACE should explicitly
include landscape architects alongside other qualified professions,
when appropriate. Because the federal government must select
architectural and engineering services based on competence and
qualifications rather than on price,\31\ it is imperative that
landscape architects be included in IDIQ solicitations that involve the
planning, design, and management of land. This will ensure that the
most qualified professionals and firms may compete for contracting
opportunities to work on USACE water resource projects.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congress should take action to ensure landscape architects'
involvement in USACE projects impacting land
management.
To further incorporate more landscape architects in water resource
projects, ASLA urges Congress to call on the executive branch to amend
the FAR to include landscape architects' involvement in USACE water
resource projects. While Congress typically does not take action to
amend the FAR, the body can enact or amend legislation to prompt the
executive branch to amend the FAR.\32\

The Department of Defense (DoD) Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC)
provides documentation for the planning, design, construction,
sustainment, restoration, and modernization of the Military
Departments, Defense Agencies, and DoD Field Activities.\33\ The FAR
governs DoD UFC 3-201-02, which establishes minimum landscape
architectural requirements and best practices to promote consistent
landscape architectural quality for all DoD facilities and specifically
states: ``All DoD military construction (MILCON) projects with site
improvement costs over $250,000, must include a landscape plan with
supporting details and specifications prepared by a registered
professional (Architect, Engineer, or Landscape Architect) as required
by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) (Subpart 2.1).\34\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similar requirements for registered professionals such as landscape
architects in USACE civil works projects do not appear to exist. ASLA
therefore recommends WRDA 2024 include a request to the administration
to incorporate the following language in the FAR: ``All USACE projects
with site improvements must include a landscape plan with supporting
details and specifications prepared by a registered professional
(Architect, Engineer, or Landscape Architect).'' A FAR amendment can
integrate DoD UFC 3-201-02 into the WRDA framework for USACE civil
works projects to enhance coordination, efficiency, and more for
federal water infrastructure projects.
3. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers should work to expand opportunities
for small businesses to work on its water resources projects.
Throughout the years, landscape architects have successfully
collaborated with USACE through employment at USACE, but more often
through contracting and subcontracting opportunities with the agency.
However, due to their smaller size, many landscape architecture firms
often lack the tools, resources, and opportunities of large firms that
are needed to compete for and assist with large-scale USACE projects.
Historically, federal mentorship programs have proven successful in
assisting small businesses to become competitive federal contractors,
which, in turn, helps small businesses create and retain jobs.\35\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, USACE utilizes SBA's MPP Program to pair large companies
with smaller firms, including some small landscape architecture firms.
These pairings are designed to help streamline and increase the
participation of small businesses working with the USACE. This
capacity-building initiative helps protege firms develop the necessary
expertise and learn about resources to successfully compete for USACE
contracts, which can lead to increased innovation and economic growth.
ASLA urges the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to enhance its efforts
in promoting the U.S. Small Business Administration's Mentor-Protege
Program, particularly with small landscape architecture firms. Small
landscape architecture firms have a proven track record of providing
critical design, restoration, and public engagement services to USACE
projects. Efforts to increase the profession's participation in
contracting opportunities benefit all parties and the nation as a
whole.
4. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers should adopt The Sustainable SITES
Initiative (SITES) to enhance its workforce and to help guide
and certify its water resources projects.
SITES is a nationally recognized set of comprehensive, voluntary
guidelines together with a rating system that assesses the sustainable
design, construction, and maintenance of landscapes and other outdoor
spaces. It is used by landscape architects, designers, engineers,
architects, developers, policymakers, and others to guide land design
and development. The SITES Rating System is produced by Green Business
Certification Inc., which owns exclusive rights to the SITES Rating
System, its publications, and trademarks. The material on which the
SITES Rating System is based was developed through a collaborative,
interdisciplinary effort of the American Society of Landscape
Architects Fund, The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center at The
University of Texas at Austin, and the United States Botanic Garden.
SITES projects include government facilities, university campuses,
public parks, commercial buildings, hotels, mixed-use developments,
military campuses, and more. As of fall 2023, more than 330 projects
are participating in the SITES program, covering 1.28 billion square
feet of landscapes and outdoor spaces that span 22 countries and 41
U.S. states and the District of Columbia. SITES-certified projects lead
to high-performing landscapes that mitigate flooding, drought and heat,
reduce stormwater runoff, and improve water quality while also
providing other community-wide benefits.
In 2015, the General Services Administration (GSA)--the federal
agency responsible for managing and supporting the basic functioning of
federal agencies, property, and contract options--adopted SITES. The
GSA's adoption of SITES is included in GSA's Facilities Standards for
the Public Buildings Service (P-100) document, which establishes design
standards and criteria for new buildings, site improvements,
infrastructural projects, major and minor alterations, and work in
historic structures for the Public Buildings Service (PBS) of the
General Services Administration.\39\ ``The GSA determined that the
incorporation of SITES offers a highly effective and efficient way to
compel environmental performance and project efficiencies, including
effective cost control, on various capital project types.'' \40\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Landscape architects led GSA's SITES pilot project at the Peter V.
Domenici U.S. Courthouse in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The site's 4.4-
acre revitalization addressed irrigation issues affecting parking by
switching to native plants that improved water management, decreased
energy use, increased urban habitat, and enhanced community
culture.\41\ GSA also achieved SITES certification for the new Federal
Office Building in Miramar, Florida.\42\ The 20-acre project houses a
federal building campus, which minimizes impacts and maximizes
harmonization with the adjacent conservation areas and nearby Florida
Everglades. Recently, landscape architects utilized SITES to help plan
and design GSA's Columbus Land Port of Entry--a 28.65-acre expansion
project in Columbus, New Mexico's Chihuahuan Desert Grassland.
Landscape architects redesigned the original site to accommodate
increased vehicle and pedestrian traffic and decrease stormwater runoff
from roofs and pavement using native plants.\43\ A recipient of the
2022 GSA Design Awards for landscape architecture and architecture, the
Columbus Land Port of Entry was praised for its sustainability and
melding high functionality with regional culture and resource
stewardship.\44\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASLA believes that SITES guidelines are complementary to and align
with USACE's EWN program. Moreover, the SITES rating system would allow
USACE to showcase its commitment to sustainable infrastructure
practices and to systematically document projects' performance, both of
which could be beneficial in working with policymakers to demonstrate
cost-benefit and rate-of-return analyses.
Further, ASLA urges USACE employees to consider becoming a SITES
Accredited Professional (SITES AP). Similar to how a LEED credential
denotes proficiency in sustainable design, construction, and operations
standards for buildings, SITES AP provides professionals with the
opportunity to increase and demonstrate their knowledge, expertise, and
commitment to sustainable land development. The SITES AP credential
applies to landscape architects, architects, engineers, sustainability
consultants, planners, ecologists, urban designers, and others
interested in nature-based solutions, optimizing ecosystem services,
and ensuring outcomes of a development project are sustainable,
resilient, and regenerative.\45\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given the success of SITES in general and at the U.S. General
Services Administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers could easily
adopt SITES guidelines and certification for its water resources
projects.
Conclusion
Thank you again for the opportunity to provide written testimony on
the reauthorization of WRDA and the valuable work the USACE. ASLA looks
forward to working with Congress to implement these recommendations
that enable landscape architects to continue to plan and design our
nation's water resources projects.
If you have any questions or would like to follow up on this
legislative matter, please contact me or ASLA Director of Federal
Government Affairs, Roxanne Blackwell.

Letter of December 12, 2023, to Hon. Sam Graves, Chairman, and Hon.
Rick Larsen, Ranking Member, Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure, from John D.S. Allen, President, Water Replenishment
District Board of Directors, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Grace F.
Napolitano
December 12, 2023.
The Honorable Sam Graves,
Chairman,
U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, 2165 Rayburn
House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Rick Larsen,
Ranking Member,
U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, 2165 Rayburn
House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen:
On behalf of the Water Replenishment District's (WRD) Board of
Directors, I writ e to express our support for enhancing the authority
and flexibility of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to address local
water supply needs in the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of
2024. As Congress works to create a safer, more innovative and
resilient infrastructure for our nation, we hope you will prioritize
ensuring an adequate water supply for our communities.
WRD manages groundwater for over four million people in forty-three
cities in southern Los Angeles County. This region contains 11% of
California's population. The 420-square mile service area uses
approximately 72 billion gallons (220,000-acre feet) of groundwater per
year. Nearly half of the water consumed within WRD's service area comes
from groundwater sources. The other half comes from water imported from
the Bay Delta and the Colorado River. For over sixty-one years, the
District has successfully pioneered sustainable water strategies that
reduce the strain on the state's limited supply of imported water.
As California and the nation work to promote drought resilience,
water independence is critical to both these efforts for long-term
environmental and economic health. As you continue to consider WRDA
2024, we hope that WRD can be a partner and resource.
We appreciate your steadfast leadership on flood control, water
supply and environmental restoration issues and look forward to working
closely with you and your staff. Please consider this an open
invitation to visit WRD's state-of-the-art water treatment facilities.
If you have any further questions please contact Angelina Mancillas.
Sincerely,
John D.S. Allen,
President, Water Replenishment District Board of Directors.
