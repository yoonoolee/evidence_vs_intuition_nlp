SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation
FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime
Transportation
RE:      LCoast Guard and Maritime Transportation
Subcommittee Hearing on ``Review of Fiscal Year 2024 Budget
Request for the Coast Guard''
_______________________________________________________________________

I. PURPOSE

The Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation
will hold a hearing on Tuesday, April 18, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. ET
in 2253 Rayburn House Office Building to receive testimony on
the President's Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget Request for the
Coast Guard in preparation for consideration of annual
authorizing legislation for the Coast Guard. The Subcommittee
will hear testimony from representatives of the United States
Coast Guard (Coast Guard or Service).

II. BACKGROUND

The Coast Guard was established on January 28, 1915,
through the consolidation of the Revenue Cutter Service
(established in 1790) and the Lifesaving Service (established
in 1848).\1\ The Coast Guard later assumed the duties of three
other agencies: the Lighthouse Service (established in 1789),
the Steamboat Inspection Service (established in 1838), and the
Bureau of Navigation (established in 1884).\2\

Under Section 102 of title 14, United States Code, the
Coast Guard has primary responsibility to enforce or assist in
the enforcement of all applicable Federal laws on, under, and
over the high seas and waters subject to the jurisdiction of
the United States; to ensure the safety of life and property at
sea; to carry out domestic and international icebreaking
activities; and, as one of the six armed forces of the United
States, to maintain defense readiness to operate as a
specialized service in the Navy upon the declaration of war or
when the President directs.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ 14 U.S.C. Sec.  102.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Coast Guard is directed by a Commandant, appointed by
the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to a
four-year term.\4\ Admiral Linda L. Fagan was sworn in as the
27th Commandant of the Coast Guard in June 2022.\5\

FY 2024 COAST GUARD BUDGET REQUEST:

The President requests $13.5 billion for FY 2024 for the
activities of the Coast Guard, including $12.1 billion in total
discretionary funding.\7\ The FY 2024 request for discretionary
funding represents an increase of $421 million (3.6 percent)
from the FY 2023 enacted level.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ Budget Justification, supra note 6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT (O&S):

The President requests $10.2 billion for the O&S account
for FY 2024, a $523 million (5.4 percent) increase from the FY
2023 enacted level.\8\ The O&S account supports the day-to-day
activities of the Coast Guard including administrative
expenses, support costs, travel, lease payments, and the
operation and maintenance of infrastructure and assets. The O&S
account also funds personnel compensation and benefits for
approximately 44,000 military personnel and 9,000 civilian
employees.\9\ Included in this request is $5.4 billion for
military pay and personnel support; $433 million for mission
support, including enterprise management and environmental
compliance and restoration; and $4.4 billion for field
operations.\10\

Statement_FINAL.pdf [hereinafter 2024 Budget Overview: Posture
Statement].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The O&S budget request includes increases in funding to
cover follow-on costs for the operation and maintenance of
newly acquired assets and technology and increases in other
administrative expenses such as an increase to cover the cost
of the 2023 military pay raise (4.6 percent), 2023 civilian pay
raise (4.6 percent), 2024 proposed military pay raise (5.2
percent), and 2024 proposed civilian pay raise (5.2
percent).\11\ Like other military services, the Coast Guard has
fallen short of its recruiting targets and is approximately
4,800 members short across its workforce.\12\ To address these
challenges, the Coast Guard requests $12 million to fund
additional personnel and offices to augment the Coast Guard's
recruiting efforts.\13\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The President requests $24.7 million within O&S for
environmental compliance and restoration (EC&R) funding in FY
2024, a $358,000 increase from the FY 2023 enacted level.\14\
The EC&R funding provides for the clean-up and restoration of
contaminated Coast Guard facilities, and for the remediation of
Coast Guard assets to ensure they are safe to operate or can be
decommissioned in compliance with environmental laws. The
requested funding for EC&R continues long-term monitoring at 29
sites and begins or continues investigation and remediation
site work at 33 sites.\15\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The proposed O&S increases are offset in part by proposed
cuts derived through decommissioning certain legacy assets that
will result in a total cost savings of $29.1 million and 167
full-time equivalent positions.\16\ Specifically, the FY 2024
budget request proposes the decommissioning of:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\16\ 2024 Budget Overview: Posture Statement, supra note 10.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

LFive HC-130H Long Range Surveillance Aircraft
($9.8 million);

LOne 210-foot Reliance Class Medium Endurance
Cutter ($4.2 million);

LTwo 110-foot legacy Island Class Patrol Boats
($1.7 million); and

LSix MH-65 helicopters ($13.4 million).\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\17\ Budget Justification, supra note 6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS (PC&I):

The President requests $1.6 billion for the PC&I account, a
$120 million (7.2 percent) decrease over the FY 2023 enacted
level.\18\ The PC&I account funds the acquisition, procurement,
construction, rebuilding, and physical improvements of Coast
Guard owned and operated vessels, aircraft, facilities, aids-
to-navigation (AtoN), communications and information technology
systems, and related equipment.\19\ Specifically, the budget
request includes funding requests for sustainment and
acquisition for several assets under PC&I which are broken down
below.\20\

IN-SERVICE VESSEL SUSTAINMENT:

Major Maintenance Availabilities (MMA) ensure in-service
vessels continue to meet their designed service life through
the recapitalization of hull, mechanical, electrical and
electronic systems that have been identified as the highest
contributors to maintenance costs and operational availability
degradation.\21\ Service Life Extension Programs (SLEPs)
increase the service life of in-service vessels without
significantly modifying capabilities. The budget requests: $43
million for 47-ft Motor Life Boat SLEP; $46.2 million for 270-
ft Medium Endurance Cutter SLEP; $17.8 million for 175-ft
Coastal Buoy Tender MMA; and $13 million for CGC Healy
SLEP.\22\

NATIONAL SECURITY CUTTER (NSC):

The budget requests $17.1 million for class wide
activities, post-delivery of an 11th NSC and program close-out
costs.\23\ The Coast Guard's Program of Record (POR) originally
called for eight NSCs to replace the Service's fleet of twelve
high endurance cutters. The NSCs were originally intended to
operate in excess of 185 days per year to maximize operational
capability, but based on crewing and maintenance concerns, the
Coast Guard now intends to operate the vessels for a maximum of
185 days per year.\24\ Congress has funded eleven vessels. The
tenth vessel is scheduled for delivery later this year.\25\

Service's aging fleet of 29 Medium Endurance Cutters
(WMECs).\27\ The delivery of OPC #1 is anticipated to occur in
FY 2023.

The budget requests $20 million for production management
costs and post-delivery activities. The Coast Guard's POR calls
for a total of 65 FRCs to replace the Service's fleet of 110-ft
Island Class Patrol Boats (WPBs). To date, 50 vessels have been
commissioned into service.\28\ Delivery of hulls 51 through 54
is anticipated to occur in FY 2023.\29\ Funding for an
additional four FRCs is included in the Coast Guard's Unfunded
Priority List (UPL), which would be hulls 66 through 69.\30\

POLAR SECURITY CUTTER (PSC):

The budget requests $170 million to advance procurement of
the PSC.\32\ The service's POR calls for three PSC to replace
the service's two heavy icebreakers--only one of which is still
operational. The first PSC is expected to be delivered between
2026 and 2027. The program has been subject to significant
delays. At the end of last year, V.T. Halter Marine, the yard
that was awarded the contract, was purchased by Bollinger
Shipyards.\33\

AIRCRAFT:

The budget requests $114.8 million for aircraft, which
includes funding for missionization of 14 HC-27Js received from
the United States Air Force, program administration activities
for the HC-130J aircraft, sustainment of MH-65 and MH-60
helicopters, and installation of small unmanned aircraft
systems (UAS) capability on the NSC fleet.\37\ In its UPL, the
Coast Guard included $138.5 million for the purchase of one
missionized HC-130J.\38\ The Coast Guard currently has three
unfunded aircraft of the 22 HC-130Js called for in its program
of record. The Service also requests $113 million in its UPL
for 4 MH-60T helicopters.\39\

OTHER ACQUISITION PROGRAMS:

The budget requests $100.6 million for other acquisition
programs, including $25.3 million to update the service's
antiquated IT technology.\40\ The Service's UPL includes $11
million for a new mariner credentialing system. The current
system was established in the early 1990s.\41\ It is a limiting
factor as our Nation seeks to increase the pool of licensed
mariners.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONSTRUCTION AND FACILITIES MAINTENANCE:

The budget request also includes $144 million for shore
facilities and AtoN.\42\ This request is a decrease of
approximately $271 million from the FY 2023 enacted level.\43\
The Coast Guard estimates that there is a $1 billion deferred
shore facility maintenance backlog, while the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) approximated that number at $2.6
billion in February 2019 (likely higher today), according to
Coast Guard information.\44\ As of 2018, the deferred
maintenance backlog included more than 5,600 projects, while
the recapitalization and new construction backlog included 125
projects.\45\ GAO's analysis of Coast Guard data found that as
of November 2018, there were hundreds of recapitalization
projects without cost estimates--representing a majority of
recapitalization projects.\46\ Coast Guard officials told GAO
that these projects were in the preliminary stages of
development.\47\ From that report, the GAO recommended that the
Commandant of the Coast Guard employ models for its asset lines
to predict the outcome of investments, analyze trade-offs, and
optimize decisions among competing investments.\48\ In addition
to the amount included in their budget request, the Coast Guard
included $694.3 million in their FY 2024 UPL for shore facility
maintenance.\49\

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT:

The President requests $7.5 million in FY 2024 for the
Coast Guard's Research and Development (R&D) account, an amount
equal to the FY 2023 enacted level.\50\ The R&D account
supports improved mission performance for the Service's 11
statutory missions through applied research and development of
new technology and methods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\50\ Budget Justification, supra note 6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Coast Guard intends to use the requested $7.5 million
in FY 2024 to develop technologies and systems that improve
operational presence and response, as well as perform
technology assessments to inform the early stages of the
acquisition process. Of the funding, $500,000 is derived from
the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund as authorized by the Oil
Pollution Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. Sec.  2701-2761).\51\

REVIEW OF FISCAL YEAR 2024 BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE COAST GUARD

----------

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 2023

House of Representatives,
Subcommittee on Coast Guard and
Maritime Transportation,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 2:16 p.m. in
room 2253 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Daniel Webster
(Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Mr. Webster of Florida. The Subcommittee on Coast Guard and
Maritime Transportation will come to order.
I ask unanimous consent that the chairman be able to
declare a recess at any time during this subcommittee hearing.
So ordered.
I ask unanimous consent that Members not on the
subcommittee be permitted to sit and to ask questions.
Without objection, so ordered.
Remember, if you have a document to insert in the record,
be sure to email it to the T&I Committee.
I now recognize myself for an opening statement of 5
minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL WEBSTER OF FLORIDA, CHAIRMAN,
SUBCOMMITTEE ON COAST GUARD AND MARITIME TRANSPORTATION

Mr. Webster of Florida. Today, we are convened to receive
testimony from the Coast Guard on the fiscal year 2024 budget
request. I would like to welcome our witnesses, Admiral Linda
Fagan, the Commandant of the Coast Guard; and Master Chief
Heath B. Jones, the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast
Guard.
Commandant, I certainly appreciated the trip through
Florida and points south. I really had a great time, it was
good, along with those that came with us during the district
work week.
Both of our witnesses actually started their tenure here
just this last year. So, we welcome you both.
As we examine the Coast Guard's fiscal year 2024 budget
request, the Coast Guard continues to be spread thin. At a time
when the Coast Guard has seen an ever-increasing demand for its
services, I fear the headwinds of recruiting challenges and
insufficient budget requests jeopardize the Service's ability
to meet their mission's needs.
While the President's budget includes an increase in
operations and support, the procurement, construction, and
improvements account--which pays for the new vessels, IT, and
shoreside infrastructure investments you need to meet future
missions--would be funded at less than half the level that
Congress authorized last year if we were to enact the
administration's request. The committee is deeply concerned
about what it would mean to the future of mission capabilities.
At the same time, like other Armed Forces, the Coast Guard
is facing recruitment challenges. Those challenges are only
expected to get worse in the coming years. This year, the
expected shortfall is about 4,800 members. I look forward to
hearing from you on what you are doing to address those
challenges.
As the Biden administration continues to pursue expansion
of offshore wind energy production off our coast, I want to
ensure the Coast Guard is taking its role as the primary
Federal agency responsible for maritime navigation safety
seriously, and that it is not merely being a rubber stamp for
the Department of the Interior. Regrettably, it appears that
the Coast Guard continues to implement the recommendation of
the Atlantic Coast Port Route Study at a glacial pace, even
after being directed by Congress to implement those
recommendations.
I am sure some of my colleagues will have questions about
these efforts and whether we can expect any resolution in the
near term.
I also remain concerned about the security of our ports'
infrastructure, especially as it relates to the Chinese cranes
at our marine terminals and continued cyber intrusions that
threaten our port operations. I look forward to hearing what
the Coast Guard is doing to counter those threats from
cyberattacks, transnational crime organizations, and bad state
actors.
Commandant Fagan, I understand that, per the Don Young
Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022, the Department of
Transportation has been given 90 days to request a transfer of
LORAN towers from the Coast Guard. If no request is received,
then the Coast Guard can proceed with disposition of the
towers. I urge you not to provide DOT with any extension of
this 90-day period. LORAN ceased operation in 2008. In fact,
DOT has had not 90 days to make this decision, but they have
had 15 years and 90 days, a long time. Time is not what is
lacking, the ability to make a decision by DOT is what is
lacking.
On the final note, in 2016, Congress directed the Coast
Guard to determine the portion of track 43 on St. Paul Island,
Alaska, that the Service needed to be retained in order to
carry out its reduced operational role on the island after the
2008 closure of the LORAN facility on the island. The
legislation further directed the Service to transfer the
remainder of track 43 to the local Alaska Native Village
Corporation.
On June 13, 2017, within the statutory timeframe, the Coast
Guard submitted to Congress a map of the portion of track 43 to
be retained, and the portion which would be transferred. The
statutory deadline for the transfer was August 13, 2017,
roughly--a lot of days ago. The committee was surprised to
learn recently that, only after asking the Service for a status
of the transfer, that the transfer had never occurred, and the
Coast Guard now intends to amend the boundary of the portion of
track 43 to be transferred.
The committee has no objection to amending the boundaries,
assuming the amendment meets an operational Coast Guard need.
However, by the close of business day, Friday, April 28th, I
ask the Coast Guard to please provide committee staff with a
briefing on the transfer, including a map showing the amended
boundaries of the parcel proposed to be transferred. Do you
think that could be accommodated?
Admiral Fagan. Absolutely, Mr. Chairman. We look forward to
accommodating that request.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you. Thank you for your
participation today. I look forward to your testimony.
[Mr. Webster of Florida's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Daniel Webster of Florida, Chairman,
Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation
Today we convene to receive testimony from the Coast Guard on its
Fiscal Year 2024 budget request.
I'd like to welcome our witnesses--Admiral Linda L. Fagan, the
Commandant of the Coast Guard, and Master Chief Heath B. Jones, the
Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard. Commandant, I certainly
appreciated the opportunity to travel to Key West with you over the
recent District Work Period. Both of our witnesses assumed their roles
last year, and we welcome them both.
As we examine the Coast Guard's Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Request,
the Coast Guard continues to be spread thin. At a time when the Coast

state actors.

Mr. Webster of Florida. I now recognize Ranking Member
Carbajal for an opening statement.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Chair Webster, for calling today's
hearing on the fiscal year 2024 budget request for the U.S.
Coast Guard.
Before I provide my remarks, I want to ask for unanimous
consent that Ranking Member Larsen's written statement be
included in the record.
Mr. Webster of Florida. So ordered.
[Mr. Larsen of Washington's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen of Washington, Ranking Member,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
Thank you, Chair Webster. The U.S. Coast Guard plays a vital role
in safeguarding the efficient movement of goods in our marine
transportation system and so much more. The women and men of the Coast
Guard conduct search and rescue operations at sea, prevent the shipment
of drugs across our maritime borders, and protect sovereignty in the
Arctic and across the world.
The Coast Guard is a lifesaving agency, a regulatory agency, a law
enforcement agency, and a military agency. Each aspect is critical to
our national and economic security.
I would like to welcome Admiral Fagan and Master Chief Jones and
commend you both for your leadership at the Coast Guard. I know
Coasties pride themselves for doing a lot with a little but that needs
to change.
For fiscal year 2024 the Coast Guard has requested $13.5 billion,
which represents a 3.6 percent increase over the 2023 enacted budget.
While this may put the Coast Guard on a better path, we must do better.
We cannot expect to have a big-league Coast Guard with little league
funding.
Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have suggested
reverting back to FY22 funding levels. Doing so would severely impact
the Coast Guard causing them to halt their two highest priority
acquisitions--the Offshore Patrol Cutter and Polar Security Cutter--
putting them further behind. Cutting Coast Guard funding would reduce
operational readiness along our maritime borders and impact national
security. We cannot allow this to happen.
Fortunately, I believe that my Committee colleagues understand the
importance of robust Coast Guard funding and I look forward to marking
up a strong Coast Guard Authorization Act next week.
Coast Guard members and their families are too often forced to live
and work in dilapidated buildings and Coasties often work on cutters
with out-of-date technology.
Coasties stationed on cutters at sea should be able to call their
families, Coast Guard cadets at the Coast Guard Academy should be able
to sleep in rooms that are free of asbestos, and Coasties across the
Service should have access to gender appropriate bathrooms.
While I applaud the Coast Guard's efforts to modernize its
recruitment plan, the best way to recruit and retain more service
members is to support our Coasties.
My primary concern is the deplorable, dilapidated buildings
servicemembers must work and live in on a daily basis. Inadequate
housing and childcare are a persistent complaint amongst
servicemembers. If we want to increase retention and diversity, we must
do more to support our Coast Guard members.
I am concerned about the downward trend in recruiting. The Coast
Guard needs to recruit over 4,000 service members in order to reach its
recruiting goal. I look forward to an update on progress made to meet
the 2023 recruitment goal.
I am also concerned about the 35.6 percent decrease in funding
requested for shore facilities and aids to navigation. This is
particularly alarming considering the Coast Guard's estimated $3
billion shoreside infrastructure maintenance backlog.
This deficit has grown after many years of underfunding, and I want
to know how the Coast Guard arrived at just $180 million needed to
address the backlog.
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses how the President's
budget will ensure adequate resources for the Coast Guard, MARAD, the
FMC, and all the programs that support and regulate the U.S. maritime
industry.
Finally, I'd like to take a minute to recognize the work the Coast
Guard has done to help address sexual assault and sexual harassment in
the commercial maritime industry. Since Congress enacted the Safer Seas
Act in December, the Coast Guard has taken immediate action to ensure
prompt implementation.
The Service has created a centralized location for reporting of
incidents, distributed information to industry on reporting
requirements and associated penalties, and opened new investigations
and prosecutions under the new authority. The Coast Guard has to be
candid with its needs and Congress must provide the necessary
resources.
I will be watching closely as the Coast Guard completes
implementation of the Safer Seas Act.
Thank you and I yield back.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL OF CALIFORNIA,
RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON COAST GUARD AND MARITIME
TRANSPORTATION

Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Admiral Fagan and Master Chief Jones, thank you for being
here today, and thank you for your service. Your leadership is
instrumental in supporting Coasties, and you have done an
outstanding job leading the Service. I am confident that the
Coast Guard has a bright future ahead under your experienced
guidance.
As has been mentioned, the Coast Guard performs many
important roles that are critical for maintaining our national
and economic security. From ensuring navigable waterways to
securing our borders and the safety of life at sea, the Coast
Guard's mission set is very diverse. We expect a lot from our
Coasties, and this oftentimes requires them to wear multiple
hats. For instance, a drug interdiction can quickly turn into a
search and rescue mission. While the Coast Guard's
responsibilities have expanded, its budget has not.
I was pleased that the fiscal year 2024 budget request
included a slight increase in the discretionary funding, but
more resources are still needed to support the Service.
I am pleased that the Coast Guard has been able to replace
much of its 40-year-old surface fleet and aircraft. Last
Congress, I was proud to support the Don Young Coast Guard
Authorization Act of 2022, which authorized substantial funding
to address long-overdue vessel and equipment replacement, as
well as shoreside infrastructure repair. Unfortunately, these
levels were not matched in the fiscal year 2022 budget.
Aside from the new assets and upgraded facilities, there
are other ways to improve the lives of servicemembers, both on
land and at sea. I have heard from servicemembers across the
country about mental health concerns. Their job can take a
physical and mental toll, which is only exacerbated by a 4,000
servicemember deficit. We must do more not only to expand
mental health services, but also to improve the quality of life
for servicemembers, especially those in isolated locations,
some of which I have visited.
Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention the Coast
Guard's efforts to address sexual assault and harassment in the
commercial maritime industry. I was an original cosponsor of
the Safer Seas Act, and I am glad to see that the Coast Guard
has acted swiftly to implement the important reforms passed
last Congress. We have a long way to go, but I believe under
Admiral Fagan's leadership, we will bring justice to victims
and help protect future mariners from harm.
I look forward to today's testimonies and discussions about
how Congress can support a robust Coast Guard.
[Mr. Carbajal's prepared statement follows:]

TESTIMONY OF ADMIRAL LINDA L. FAGAN, COMMANDANT, U.S. COAST
GUARD; AND MASTER CHIEF HEATH B. JONES, MASTER CHIEF PETTY
OFFICER OF THE COAST GUARD, U.S. COAST GUARD

TESTIMONY OF ADMIRAL LINDA L. FAGAN, COMMANDANT,
U.S. COAST GUARD

Admiral Fagan. Good afternoon, Chairman Webster. Thank you,
Ranking Member Carbajal, distinguished members of the
subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today,
and thank you for entering my written testimony into the
record.
On behalf of the entire Service, thank you for your
continued support of the United States Coast Guard. With the
funding provided in 2023 appropriation, we are continuing our
largest fleet recapitalization in decades, building vital shore
infrastructure and supporting our workforce and their families.
The world is changing, and the pace of that change is
accelerating. Our commitments to defend, protect, and save grow
every day, and demand for the Service around the globe has
never been higher. In these challenges, there is an
opportunity, and we must invest in 2024 and beyond to generate
sustained readiness, resilience, and capability to build the
Coast Guard of the future.
The Coast Guard workforce is my highest priority. But like
other branches of the Armed Forces, the Coast Guard is
experiencing a workforce shortage. We are struggling to recruit
the people we need to hire into our ranks every year. Our
recruiting shortfall threatens our readiness, threatens our
ability to serve the American people. We must invest not just
in workforce recruiting capacity, but in support initiatives to
meet mission: healthcare, childcare, and housing.
We are a global Coast Guard. And as we continue to invest
in the homeland, we also serve to counter strategic competition
around the world. The Coast Guard serves as the Nation's
surface presence in the Arctic and Antarctica, and our fleet of
only two polar icebreakers does not deliver the high-latitude
presence we require as an Arctic nation. The fiscal year 2024
budget requests funding to grow the Coast Guard's icebreaking
capacity to enable a shift from episodic presence to year-round
presence in the high latitudes.
Every Coast Guard mission begins and ends at a shore
facility. To generate readiness, retain our workforce, and
support our families, we must maintain and modernize our
buildings, piers, housing, and other infrastructure. The Coast
Guard requires stable, predictable shore infrastructure funding
to ensure facilities are ready when new assets arrive, and
personnel have the space they need to support the recapitalized
fleet.
Consistent funding is vital for us to recapitalize our many
antiquated stations, sectors, training centers, air stations,
and housing, some of which were built in the late 1800s. The
fiscal year 2024 budget includes funding to build out Base
Charleston and to complete construction of future cutter home
ports in Washington and Alaska.
My vision of a $20 billion Coast Guard in 2033 includes
$400 to $500 million a year to accomplish this infrastructure
work. And I am certain you will not find a better return on
investment for the American people than the United States Coast
Guard. I ask for your continued support to ensure that the
Nation's Coast Guard, like every U.S. Armed Force, has the
resources necessary to safeguard the Nation.
I appreciate the committee's enduring support. Thank you
for the opportunity to testify this afternoon, and I look
forward to your questions. Thank you.
[Admiral Fagan's prepared statement follows:]

Prepared Statement of Admiral Linda L. Fagan, Commandant,
U.S. Coast Guard
Introduction
Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and distinguished
Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify and I
am grateful for your continuing support of the United States Coast
Guard. Today, I look forward to discussing how the Administration's FY
2024 Budget request positions the Service to generate sustained
readiness, resilience, and capability while building the Coast Guard of
the future.
As the world's premier, multi-mission, maritime service responsible
for the safety, security and stewardship of the Nation's waters, the
Coast Guard offers a unique and enduring value to the American public.
At all times a military service and branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, a
federal law enforcement agency, a first responder, a regulatory body,
and a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community, the Coast Guard serves
on the front lines for a Nation whose economic prosperity and national
security are inextricably linked to the sea.
Last year, your Coast Guard navigated unique challenges presented
by our increasingly connected and rapidly changing world. Throughout
the course of FY 2022, the Service saved or assisted over 24,000
people, removed over 335,000 pounds of cocaine and 60,000 pounds of
marijuana with an approximate wholesale value of $4.2 billion, provided
humanitarian assistance to over 12,500 non-citizens intercepted at sea,
inspected over 15,000 shipping containers for structural and hazardous
material compliance, maintained nearly 45,000 buoys and beacons across
the Marine Transportation System, conducted over 10,000 waterborne
patrols to protect critical infrastructure and key resources, and
provided nearly 21,000 hours of support to U.S. Central Command to
advance security cooperation, maritime security, and counter-piracy
objectives in the Arabian Gulf.
In the aftermath of Hurricanes Ian, Fiona, and Nicole, Coast Guard
personnel from across the country surged to Puerto Rico, Florida,
Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia where we saved or
assisted nearly 1,000 persons in distress, responded to pollution
incidents, and reopened vital ports and waterways to help communities
recover.
In the Antarctic, Coast Guard Cutter (CGC) Polar Star, the Nation's
only heavy polar icebreaker, created a navigable path through thick ice
to enable the annual replenishment of America's McMurdo Station. In the
Great Lakes, CGC Mackinaw--the Coast Guard's only heavy domestic
icebreaker--opened passages to facilitate commercial shipping across
the region.
In the Indo-Pacific, 418-foot National Security Cutters and 154-
foot Fast Response Cutters conducted combined operations and exercises
with allied and partner nations to counter Illegal, Unreported, and
Unregulated fishing and facilitate interoperability with like-minded
nations throughout the region. In the Caribbean, the Coast Guard surged
assets from across the Atlantic seaboard to respond, in coordination
with other federal agencies, to historic irregular maritime migration
on our southern maritime border.
While I remain incredibly proud of our Coast Guard Active Duty,
Reserve, Civilian, and Auxiliary workforce, we must adapt to ensure the
accelerating pace of change does not overtake our ability to protect,
defend, and save the American public we serve. Geopolitical
competition, economic volatility, climate change impacts, shifting
workforce expectations, evolving technologies, and new enterprises at
sea are converging and driving changes we must make for our Service.
The FY 2024 President's Budget is the first step in advancing our
efforts to transform our total workforce, sharpen our competitive edge,
and advance our mission excellence as we build the Coast Guard of the
future. These investments are vital to ensuring the Service has the
assets, systems, infrastructure, and support needed to further the
Nation's maritime safety, security, and prosperity.
Generate Sustained Readiness, Resilience, and Capability
Transform our Total Workforce
A shrinking American workforce combined with changing expectations
by both employees and employers is driving significant challenges in
recruiting and hiring. American workers seek flexibility, innovation,
purpose, and desire employers who foster a workplace where all people
are respected and empowered.
My highest priority is to modernize our talent management system,
which has not significantly changed in 75 years, to best recruit and
retain our workforce in the 21st century. I am committed to deploying
innovative recruiting practices; revolutionizing talent management
policies; developing individually tailored, on-demand, and modernized
learning; and delivering point of need healthcare and family services.
The FY 2024 budget requests $273 million in military and civilian
pay and benefits; $21 million to increase retention, bolster medical
services, improve the Service's training systems, and better support
the workforce; as well as $12 million to enhance the Coast Guard's
recruiting capability by funding additional recruiting personnel and
nine new recruiting offices.
Sharpen our Competitive Edge
New and rapid advancements are making access to technology
ubiquitous. These technological advancements expose global systems and
people to modern threats, including growing cybersecurity concerns,
supply chain disruptions, and navigation vulnerabilities. However,
emerging technologies also present novel opportunities to maintain a
competitive edge over malign actors.
To accomplish the broad spectrum of Coast Guard missions, we will
leverage new technology to enable rapid information sharing and provide
decision advantage to our operational commanders. Smart application of
advanced data analysis capabilities will enable us to make the best
decisions as we inspect new commercial vessels, search for overdue
recreational boaters, bolster our talent management system, and seek to
disrupt the flow of illicit drugs across our maritime border.
The FY 2024 budget requests $49 million to sustain enterprise
collaboration tools, search and rescue IT systems, and C5I capabilities
on board operational assets. Additionally, the budget includes $15
million for data analytic technology development, improving how data is
collected, analyzed, and leveraged to empower operations and support
the workforce. Requested funding also supports the rapid development of
mobile applications and bolsters telework capabilities.
Advance our Mission Excellence
The Coast Guard operates in dynamic conditions, and changes in the
strategic environment impact our missions every day. Given evolving
national security threats, we must prepare now for the challenges of
tomorrow.
We will employ our assets and resources to the highest priority
missions that we are uniquely capable to perform, build on our ability
to lead in crisis, strengthen existing and forge new partnerships to
improve global maritime governance, and safeguard a rapidly changing
Marine Transportation System.
The FY 2024 budget requests $77 million for the operations,
maintenance, crew, and mission support elements for four Fast Response
Cutters; operations and maintenance for the second Offshore Patrol
Cutter; crew, operations, and maintenance for a commercially available
polar icebreaker; crew for the first Waterways Commerce Cutter; and
crew, operations, and maintenance for four MH-60T helicopters, one HC-
130J aircraft, and one HC-27J aircraft. Additionally, the budget
includes $18 million for the operations and maintenance of newly
acquired or recapitalized shore facilities.
Build the Coast Guard of the Future
The Service continues our largest recapitalization effort since
World War II--vital to providing the capable, modern assets necessary
to meet the unprecedented demand for Coast Guard services.
Additionally, the Coast Guard continues to prioritize investments in
our shore infrastructure because our facilities, piers, runways, and
the buildings where our people eat and sleep while standing duty are as
critical for operations as our ships and aircraft.
Surface
With the continued strong support of both the Administration and
Congress, we are acquiring the Nation's first new heavy polar
icebreakers in almost half a century. The FY 2024 request of $170
million sustains the program and procures an additional portion of
long-lead time materials for the third Polar Security Cutter (PSC).
When fully operational, PSCs will provide the global reach and
icebreaking capability necessary to advance our national interests in
the Arctic and Antarctic regions, projecting U.S. sovereignty and
influence while conducting Coast Guard statutory missions in the high
latitudes.
The FY 2024 request also funds the acquisition of a commercially
available polar icebreaker, including the modifications and integrated
logistics support required to reach initial operating capability for
Coast Guard missions. The purchase and modification of a commercially
available polar icebreaker represents an effective strategy to increase
near-term presence in the Arctic until the PSC fleet is operational and
to add regional capacity in the long-term.
The Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) is one of the Service's highest
acquisition priorities and is absolutely vital to recapitalizing the
capability provided by our legacy fleet of 210-foot and 270-foot Medium
Endurance Cutters (MEC). The FY 2024 request provides $579 million for
construction of the sixth OPC and long lead time materials for the
seventh of a program of record for 25 hulls. The legacy assets the
OPC's will replace have been workhorses for decades and continue to
serve the Nation with distinction. With 13 of these cutters exceeding
50 years of Service, the MEC fleet is becoming more difficult and
expensive to maintain, and we continue to see degradation in its
operational availability.
Some of our inland tenders have been in service since the 1940s,
maintaining both fixed and floating aids to navigation for the U.S.
Marine Transportation System--the 25,000 miles of rivers and navigable
channels that support $5.4 trillion in annual commerce and 31 million
jobs. The FY 2024 request for $98 million supports program management,
long lead time material for future hulls, and construction of the first
article of the Waterways Commerce Cutter fleet. These cutters--which
will replace our legacy inland tender fleet--will feature modern
designs for propulsion and crew habitability to enable men and women to
serve in the heartland.
Aviation Assets
The FY 2024 request includes $115M to recapitalize and sustain
fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, including: sustainment of the current
MH-60T helicopter fleet; modernization and sustainment of the Coast
Guard's MH-65 helicopter fleet to improve reliability into the 2030s,
align recapitalization efforts with DoD's Future Vertical Lift program
and transition to an all MH-60 fleet; and continued missionization of
HC-27J medium-range surveillance aircraft.
Shore Infrastructure
Shore facility maintenance and recapitalization is critical to
mission success. As the Service deploys new, more capable assets,
infrastructure projects like pier construction and workforce facilities
are equally vital. The FY 2024 request includes targeted investments to
continue the buildout of Base Charleston, South Carolina, funds the
construction of a Fast Response Cutter homeport in Seward, Alaska, and
funds construction of a Waterways Commerce Cutter homeport.
Given the Coast Guard's broad infrastructure needs, these
investments and a modern approach to project planning, prioritizing,
and execution are necessary to ensure the Service has the adequately
maintained and resilient infrastructure required to meet the
operational demands of today and tomorrow.
Conclusion
The Coast Guard is the only military Service outside the Department
of Defense and the only Armed Force that is primarily funded via non-
defense appropriations. Not funding the Coast Guard at the levels
requested in this budget could jeopardize the long-term readiness of
the Service, putting American lives, national security, and the U.S.
Marine Transportation System at risk. I ask for your support to ensure
the Coast Guard--like every U.S. Armed Force--has the resources
necessary to safeguard the Nation.
Now is the time to move the U.S. Coast Guard forward. Our
commitments at home to protect, defend, and save--grow every day, while
demand for the Service around the globe has never been higher. To meet
the rising challenges, we must invest to secure the homeland and
counter strategic competitors.
With the support of the Administration and Congress, your Coast
Guard will continue to live up to our motto--Semper Paratus--Always
Ready. Thank you for your enduring support.

Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you. Next we have Master
Chief Jones.
You are recognized.

TESTIMONY OF MASTER CHIEF HEATH B. JONES, MASTER CHIEF PETTY
OFFICER OF THE COAST GUARD, U.S. COAST GUARD

Master Chief Jones. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good
afternoon, Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and
distinguished subcommittee members. It is an honor to appear
before you as a Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard.
As I begin, I would like to express my sincere appreciation
alongside Admiral Fagan and on behalf of our dedicated Coast
Guard personnel for your unwavering support.
The Coast Guard workforce is the heart and soul of our
organization, and their dedication and sacrifice keep our
Nation safe and secure. Every day, Coast Guard sentinels put
their lives on the line to protect our Nation's maritime
borders, respond to emergencies, and ensure the safety of all
Marine Transportation System users. These highly skilled
members execute a broad array of missions which require modern
resources to recruit, train, and to retain them.
As we discuss the future of the Coast Guard, my primary
focus is on our sentinels, specifically the Service's ability
to attract and retain the talented individuals necessary to
effectively carry out the critical missions our Nation demands
and our Nation deserves. The Coast Guard is a relatively small
force, and we compete with other branches of the military and
Federal agencies to attract and retain talented individuals.
The Coast Guard's recent recruiting initiatives include
opening 10 new recruiting offices, leveraging innovative
technology to reach potential recruits, initiating 4 new JROTC
programs, and developing the Scout Talent and Refer program to
incentivize servicemembers to tell the Coast Guard story. We
are applying a comprehensive workforce approach to this effort.
The fiscal year 2024 recruiting request will enhance the
Coast Guard's recruiting ability, while ensuring our members
continue to excel at their demanding missions.
The Coast Guard is more than a military service. We are a
closely bonded community. Our Coast Guard families are
paramount. Their altruistic sacrifices and constant support are
imperative to achieving our missions. The Coast Guard can
continue to retain our members and their families by providing
affordable housing, access to quality mental and physical
healthcare, competitive compensation, and modernized
infrastructure. These issues are vital to our workforce and
vital to their families.
I want to express my sincere gratitude to Congress for
enacting the Veterans Auto and Education Improvement Act,
mandating that States recognize the professional licenses of
military members and their spouses from other States,
alleviating the burden of relocating every 3 to 4 years. This
initiative is a key example of Congress' support of our
military and of their families.
While I acknowledge that those that join the Service are
not primarily motivated by financial gain, it is essential to
recognize that they may be more likely to leave for a better
compensation elsewhere. The fiscal year 2024 pay raise is a
good step in the right direction and is the largest increase
since 2002. To ensure that we continue to be an employer of
choice, we must continue to invest in the basic pay scale.
The birthplace of our enlisted workforce is Training Center
Cape May. While we are thankful for the recent support of
Congress to recapitalize the first barracks, the current
facilities inhibit the ability to continuously train recruits
to a significant service standard throughout the year.
Therefore, the Service needs a modernized training facility to
develop the most resilient and fleet-ready sentinels. To this
end, the Coast Guard has included a multipurpose training
facility at Cape May as part of our unfunded priorities list in
fiscal year 2024.
Rest assured that your Coast Guard remains steadfast in its
dedication to attracting and retaining skilled sentinels that
are empowered to protect, to defend, and to save.
Again, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you,
and I look forward to answering your questions.
[Master Chief Jones did not submit a prepared statement.]
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you so much. And we now turn
to questions from the panel. I get to be first, so, I will ask
my first question to the Commandant.
What are the capability or resource gaps that exist? Which
ones, or which one, even, is the most important to you? And how
are you working with DHS to address those?
Admiral Fagan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I remain committed
to increasing the capacity and capabilities of the Coast Guard,
and remain focused around workforce and, again, acknowledge and
appreciate the enduring support of the committee.
When you look at the fiscal year 2024 budget, President's
budget, there is great support for frontline operating capacity
in the budget and investment in infrastructure, piers,
buildings, IT. The President's budget, 2024 budget, in
conjunction with our unfunded priority list request, does a
good job capturing the infrastructure and investments needed
across the organization.
Ensuring that Coast Guard members, as we field these state-
of-the-art new cutters and aircraft, that Coast Guard members
have adequate facilities to return to. Every Coast Guard
operation starts and stops at a piece of shore infrastructure.
So, ensuring that not only are we building the new capacity
docks to field those cutters, that we are updating the aging
capacity at stations and otherwise, so that our Coast Guard men
and women can operate from state-of-the-art facilities. Thank
you.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Until this past time we were down
there in Key West, I didn't realize they also were passenger
ships, the cutters. They were saying hauled over 125, 115--
something like that--people. So, maybe there needs to be some
slight modification for that. I don't know.
But anyway, the budget request includes $98 million in
procurement funding for the Waterways Commerce Cutter program
to replace the Coast Guard's aging inland tender fleet, some of
which are approaching 80 years old. Do you expect the first WCC
to be operational by 2025?
Admiral Fagan. We appreciate the funding and support in the
fiscal year 2024 President's budget. Ninety-eight million
dollars will provide for two Waterways Commerce Cutters with
long lead-time funding for an additional two. This begins to
help us replace, as you said, those aging cutters.
We also have on our UPL an additional $48 million for home
port investments that will be needed as we field those cutters.
We are on contract, and look forward to begin building the
Waterways Commerce Cutters. They are not a particularly
complicated cutter, and should begin to come into operation
fairly quickly. They are critical to our Nation's economic
security, the $5.4 trillion of maritime commerce, economic
prosperity that the Nation enjoys, and the engine for much of
that is the internal waterways, the rivers and the countries,
in addition to our ports.
So, getting that Waterways Commerce Cutter built and into
operation is a priority, and we appreciate the budget support
for that. Thank you.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Commandant, the Port of Los Angeles
has stated that they face over 40 million cyberattacks per
month. At the same time, Chinese-manufactured cranes have the
potential to do some sort of surveillance--not that I know what
it would be, but they could gather information on the goods and
services being performed at the ports.
So, do you see an additional resource for cyber, including
R&D funds, to improve capabilities? Can you talk about that?
Admiral Fagan. The U.S. Coast Guard, in our regulatory
agency role, as we work with port facilities, ships in our
ports, cyber is part of that remit and oversight.
We have been on a path of investment as an organization,
both in cyber experts--we have recently established a cyber
specialty in our enlisted ranks. We have been hiring civilian
professionals at the district level who not only understand the
maritime transportation industry, but are also experts in cyber
as we work alongside our CISA counterparts within DHS to ensure
that the Nation has the cyber expertise and cybersecurity
needed, and we are focused in our role in the maritime realm in
that regard. Thank you.
Mr. Webster of Florida. OK, so, my time is gone, so, I will
yield back nothing.
I recognize you, Mr. Carbajal.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I thought you were
going to yield the chairmanship, so, I got excited there for a
minute.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Carbajal. Admiral Fagan, June will mark 1 year since
you assumed the Commandant position. At that time, you vowed to
do a thorough review of the Coast Guard's policies in an effort
to attract more servicemembers, increase diversity, address
mental health, and generally make life better for our Coasties.
Can you share how that is going and any policy changes that you
have made or are working on making?
Admiral Fagan. We have embarked on a substantial review and
update of many of our workforce and talent management systems
and processes. We currently operate an up or an out system, as
the other Services do, where you take junior people with no
experience in at the bottom, and progress them through a career
to gain experience and professional requirements.
We have begun doing things like agile ``A'' school. We
recently had a member join the Coast Guard who was a
credentialed paramedic, so, substantial medical training,
licensing credential. That individual came to us, completed
boot camp, and when we sent them to our medical training
school, we worked to develop a customized program to
acknowledge the substantial experience the individual already
had, and speed them out to the fleet. The member is currently
serving the clinic in Station New York much sooner than we
would have been able to, otherwise.
So, that is just one example of increasing flexibility,
nimbleness, and recognizing the talent pool that we are drawing
into the Service as we continue to focus on our recruiting
needs. Thank you.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Master Chief Jones, issues faced by enlisted Coasties are
often different from those of officers. I was an enlisted in
the Marine Corps. What are the top three concerns or issues you
hear from enlisted members, and what is the Coast Guard doing
to address those issues?
Master Chief Jones. Congressman, routinely, no matter where
we travel in the Coast Guard, the top three issues that I hear
are: access to available and affordable housing; access to
mental and physical healthcare; and then just kind of lumped in
on the third is just general overall cost of living, whether it
be base pay, whether it be affordable childcare, and those
types of approaches.
So, we have many things that we are working on when it
comes to the housing. There are some areas, smaller, more
remote areas where we are investing in Coast Guard-owned
housing. There are areas where we do have the availability of
access to DoD base housing, working in cooperation with access
there. And the other areas where it is not available, there is
not military housing there, working with DoD to ensure that we
have comparable housing allowance rates to afford our members
the housing they deserve.
Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
Admiral Fagan, with the passage of the Safer Seas Act, the
Coast Guard is tasked with implementing several new authorities
and requirements for industry. Prompt implementation and
enforcement is extremely important.
Separately, the Coast Guard has yet to implement the man-
overboard requirements included in the CVSSA 13 years ago. I
know that was before your time assuming the Commandant
position.
When should we expect to see these regulations?
And can you commit to an expeditious implementation of the
Safer Seas requirements? I would say 13 years is a long time.
Admiral Fagan. I commit to continuing to work through the
regulatory process. I know how challenging regulatory work is.
It is important work. We have a role in it. I commit to you to
continue to advance that important work.
Passenger vessel safety and ship safety is critical, and
the Coast Guard absolutely has a role in moving critical
issues, such as the one you mentioned, forward.
Mr. Carbajal. Is there any way to expedite that a little
bit to see the end of the tunnel?
Admiral Fagan. So, I will ask my staff to come back and
give you a more realistic timeline on when we could expect to
see that come to a closure. But I agree, we have been at it for
some time, and we need to continue to move that regulatory
project forward.
Mr. Carbajal. Great. Thank you very much.
Mr. Chair, I yield back.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Babin, you are recognized for 5
minutes.
Dr. Babin. Thank you very much.
And thank you, Admiral.
And Mr. Jones, thank you so much for being here, Master
Chief.
From protecting our ports and waterways to assisting our
communities during hurricanes, the Coast Guard is a well-known,
vital component of my district in southeast Texas and the gulf
coast. I proudly represent both Coast Guard Sector Houston-
Galveston and Air Station Houston, each housed at Ellington
Field in southeast Houston.
Admiral Fagan, my first few questions are for you. If we
can't get through everything, I hope you don't mind that I will
have them submitted.
As the Coast Guard looks to transition to an MH-60 rotary-
wing fleet, I understand that the Coast Guard is slowly phasing
out many of its aging MH-65s, with the intention of reducing
its overall rotary-wing fleet from 146 to 126 aircraft.
Air Station Houston currently hosts three MH-65 Dolphin
helicopters. I understand the current plan is to phase these
three helicopters out and replace them with just two MH-60s.
While I recognize that the MH-60 is a very capable platform
compared with the MH-65, I have concerns that reducing the
number of airframes in service may impact the Coast Guard's
operational capabilities.
Presumably, with fewer aircraft at an air station, it would
be more challenging to respond to multiple search and rescue
missions, drug interdictions, or patrols, given that a single
helicopter can only be in one place at one time. And I don't
anticipate drug runners will be idling their boats while they
wait for the helicopters to arrive. We can't ask folks to just
tread water while they await assistance.
How does the Coast Guard plan to maintain its operational
capabilities with less operational assets?
Admiral Fagan. We are in the process of transitioning away
from the H-65 fleet of aircraft. They have definitely reached
their age limits. And so, there is an imperative around moving
to a single fleet of H-60 helicopters. These aircraft have far
more range and speed than the helicopters that they are
replacing. And so, continuing the funding support necessary to
field 60s becomes critical, and we appreciate where we are with
it.
We have got a request in the UPL for $113 million to field
additional 60s. Right now, we have indicated a transition to at
least 127, but we continue to look at the helicopter fleet we
have in place now, what the capabilities are that the new 60s
bring into the mix, and then understand that we do have an
obligation to continue to meet response times, search and
rescue requirements for the American public. This is lifesaving
work, and we are committed to meeting those requirements. We
continue to work towards identifying what that right number and
mix looks like.
Dr. Babin. OK. In a report shared with the committee last
May regarding the Coast Guard's interdiction of illicit drugs
in transit zones, the report shares that the Coast Guard was
able to intercept about 10 percent of the cocaine flow coming
into the United States. In the report, the Coast Guard notes
that the level of effort toward this mission is assessed as
adequate, given the boundary conditions of balancing the
execution of other statutory missions and workforce and
material readiness.
I assume the Coast Guard is not satisfied with a 10-percent
interdiction rate. My takeaway from that is that you have too
few resources to adequately carry out your growing mission set.
What are some of the factors that would improve the Coast
Guard's ability to carry out its drug interdiction mission, and
would you acknowledge that additional surface assets could help
the Coast Guard improve its mission effectiveness?
And if so, why does the President's budget not include
resources for additional FRCs?
Admiral Fagan. The counternarcotics mission that the Coast
Guard conducts on behalf of the Nation requires a force package
of asset types: ship, over-the-horizon pursuit boat, helicopter
with airborne use of force capacity. Fielding new assets that
are more reliable and don't experience the unplanned
maintenance periods that the current aging fleet of helicopters
and ships are experiencing is a priority for the Service, that
the ships and equipment we have out on vector are more
reliable.
We continue to partner with other international partners in
engagement to ensure that we are meeting that mission demand.
The FRCs have been an incredibly helpful platform as we meet
our counternarcotics mission.
Dr. Babin. OK, thank you.
We are going to have two rounds today, is that right, two
rounds of questions? OK. Well, because I have got some for the
master chief, too. Thank you, and I yield back.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Garamendi.
Mr. Garamendi. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations,
this being your first--not your first hearing, but your first
one on readiness and the state of the Coast Guard.
When we were chatting a couple of months ago, we covered a
whole series of issues. In my previous tenure on this I got to
be known as somebody that was concerned about icebreakers.
Could you bring me up to date on the status of the heavy
icebreaker that presumably is being built?
Admiral Fagan. We are on budget, on contract for a Polar
Security Cutter. The 2024 budget includes $170 million, which
will be long lead-time material for a third Polar Security
Cutter.
The yard that we contracted with was recently purchased. It
is now Bollinger Mississippi. We continue to work closely with
the yard to get to the correct level of maturity on detailed
design.
Mr. Garamendi. You are being--excuse me for interrupting.
Tell me exactly what is happening. Put the happy talk aside.
This is not going well.
Admiral Fagan. We are----
Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. The original contractor went
belly up. You have got a new contractor in. There are all kinds
of design problems. Lay it out here so that we can participate
in solving the problem.
Admiral Fagan. I am confident in the design, and I am
confident in the yard.
We have got work to do to mature that design. We have not
built an icebreaker in this Nation since the mid-1970s. This is
an incredibly complex ship to build. The steel thicknesses, the
scantlings will take effort to ensure that the design is at the
right level of maturity.
If we begin constructing before there is an appropriate
level of design, that will continue to delay reaching full
operating capacity with the vessel downstream. We are engaged
with that yard, and in the planning process through the
Integrated Planning Office with the Navy. This is a weekly
conversation. Everyone understands the sense of urgency. This
is a critical national security need for the country. We need
icebreaking capacity as a Nation. We are an Arctic nation, we
need that icebreaking capacity in the Arctic, and we are
committed to working with the yard.
I am 100 percent confident in the design as we begin to
build it, that it will be the capability that the Nation needs.
Mr. Garamendi. So, when will the design be completed?
Admiral Fagan. I continue to--I don't have a--I would give
you a date if I had one. I don't have a definitive date from my
team. I am hopeful we will have one soon. As soon as we have
that, I will share it with the committee. And once we have got
that level of design maturity, we will begin to put estimates
around what the actual----
Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. So, we don't know when the
design is going to be completed. Do you have some idea in which
decade it might actually be built?
Admiral Fagan. The design will be completed soon. I am
optimistic. Once we begin to build the ship, it is a complex
ship, and it will take a number of years to build.
Mr. Garamendi. So, which decade?
Admiral Fagan. I do not want to put a date out there. Once
we have the detailed design, it will be several years, 3-plus,
to get the completion on that ship.
Mr. Garamendi. So, what is your interim plan?
Admiral Fagan. We have money, if it is appropriated in the
President's budget, for $125 million for a commercially
available icebreaker. If it is appropriated, we are excited
about what that capability brings to the Nation. We would
operate it on--we would operate that icebreaker, and look
forward to working with the committee for bringing that----
Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. So, you have identified an
icebreaker that is out there for sale?
Admiral Fagan. There is an icebreaker available. Should we
receive an appropriation, we will continue to work to see what
is required to acquire that.
Mr. Garamendi. We have been at this a long time in this
committee, and the inability of the Coast Guard to get this
even started is a major national security problem. And frankly,
your answers are not satisfactory. I would hope that this
committee would be given specific detail.
You didn't tell us where that ship is. Have you looked at
renting, leasing long-term icebreakers?
Admiral Fagan. There is one U.S.-constructed, commercially
available icebreaker. We have worked with the committee for
language to ease the acquisition of that icebreaker. When we
have considered leasing of other icebreakers, it does not
create either greater speed or reduced cost. And so, with an
appropriation, working to acquire a commercially available
icebreaker is the most, sort of, cost and time expeditious way
forward for the Nation.
Mr. Garamendi. How many icebreakers do we need?
Admiral Fagan. I recently signed out a fleet mix analysis
that indicates we need eight to nine icebreakers.
Mr. Garamendi. And you have one under construction, the
design of which is not yet complete. You are talking about
purchasing another icebreaker from--and we happen to know the
company, so, no secrets around here.
Do you have any idea what it will take to make that
purchased icebreaker useful for the Coast Guard?
Admiral Fagan. The budget reflects $25 million to bring
that vessel into initial operating capacity. We continue to
work to estimate what out-year cost will be to support----
Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. So, the need is somewhat near
10 icebreakers.
Admiral Fagan. So, we have a polar security contract,
commercially available icebreaker Healy, which is the medium
icebreaker currently in operation, and Polar Star, which is our
heavy icebreaker. Those two are in full operation now.
Mr. Garamendi. Thank you.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Mast.
Mr. Mast. Thank you, Chairman.
Thank you, Admiral and Master Chief, for being here today.
I look forward to asking you all a few questions. And I want to
get into the idea of ``equitable'' to begin with.
And so, Admiral, I would just start with a question in this
way. As you are onboarding new Coasties, would you say that it
would be equitable if the goal was three males for every one
female? Would you say that would be equitable for onboarding?
Admiral Fagan. I am onboarding talent. I am onboarding the
best talent that I can hire. I would like that talent to be
diverse, but I am hiring talent that meets the requirements to
serve the Nation. There is not----
Mr. Mast [interrupting]. I commend you for it. Best man,
best woman for the job. Absolutely.
Admiral Fagan. Best individual for the job, absolutely.
Mr. Mast. But in terms of goal for number?
Admiral Fagan. There is no goal for number. I want the best
talent, the most diverse talent that I can field. I have a
number----
Mr. Mast [interrupting]. OK, I am going to----
Admiral Fagan [continuing]. That I need to meet for my
readiness----
Mr. Mast [interrupting]. I am going to ask this slightly
differently then, because my goal really isn't talking about
the equity of your force right now. It is about the equity of
this bridge and this waterway that you are looking at here.
[Slide]
Mr. Mast. I will start with my colleagues, then. Let me ask
my colleagues. If I got 5 minutes and you all got 2 minutes,
would that be equitable? Mr. Garamendi.
Mr. Garamendi. Your questions have always been so
brilliant. I am happy to yield.
Mr. Mast. But would me getting 5 minutes and you getting 2
minutes, would that be equitable for our timeframe on this
committee?
Mr. Garamendi. As long as you are asking the questions, I
am willing to give you the time.
Mr. Mast. You are willing to give me more time, make it
more equitable for me? I appreciate it. Thanks for working with
equity for me.
Chairman, you care to weigh in? Would half of us getting 5
minutes and others getting 3 minutes, would that be equitable
for time usage?
Mr. Webster of Florida. I don't think you have enough
variables.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Mast. I don't know what that means.
Mr. Webster of Florida. I don't know what yours mean.
Mr. Mast. Mr. Babin, you chimed in.
Dr. Babin. It wouldn't be equitable.
Mr. Mast. No.
Dr. Babin. Somebody would squawk.
Mr. Mast. They would. This is Washington, DC, and we have a
habit of not being common sense here. Equitable is 50/50. Would
you agree?
Admiral Fagan. In the context that we are talking----
Mr. Mast [interrupting]. What are we talking about, ma'am?
Admiral Fagan. So, I am committed to a full and transparent
process. I am committed to ensuring that the equities of the
users are considered as we work to create opportunity for both
user groups.
Mr. Mast. Ma'am, equity is 50/50. And what we are looking
at with this railroad bridge and this waterway is that you have
a train company, a for-profit train company looking to run 32
trains a day over that bridge. And it takes a minimum of 18
minutes just to get that bridge to go from open, where boats
can go through, to closed to back open again, when boats can go
through again.
And if you do the math on that--and they are looking to do
that over a 15-hour window of the day--then what they are doing
is they are closing off the waterway 9\1/2\ hours of the day,
9\1/2\ hours out of 15 hours. Is that equitable to the
community whose resource that is?
Admiral Fagan. We are in a rulemaking process with regard
to the permitting on this bridge.
Mr. Mast. But is it equitable, ma'am, that a community gets
5 hours out of 10 hours? Is that equitable?
Admiral Fagan. The waterway users----
Mr. Mast [interrupting]. Ma'am, let's be common sense here.
Don't filibuster my time, and let's be common sense. Is it
equitable that the community that lives in and around this
waterway, this very busy waterway, gets 5 hours out of 15
hours? Is that equitable?
Admiral Fagan. The waterway users are entitled to their
access to navigation.
Mr. Mast. Yes.
Admiral Fagan. The bridge user is entitled to their access
to the bridge. How that schedule is created will matter. The
waterway users may have higher demand during certain periods of
the day. And the----
Mr. Mast [interrupting]. But I will mention right now you
are not doing a study to determine that. You did a Waterway
Access Management Study back in 2017, which you all have chosen
to ignore. I will throw that in right now.
I am very glad that we are doing a second round, because we
are going to talk more about this. But would it be equitable--
maybe we could answer this. Let's do it a little bit more on
the numbers. If the community got 1 hour of time and the trains
got 14 hours of time, would that be considered to you
nonequitable? Can we at least say that, 1 versus 14 is
nonequitable?
Admiral Fagan. We are committed to a fully transparent
process----
Mr. Mast [interrupting]. That is not an answer to my
question, ma'am. Can you at least agree that the community only
getting 1 hour out of a 15-hour timeframe would not be
equitable for that community? You can't agree to that?
Admiral Fagan. I want to understand the use pattern and
data so that we can create a dynamic schedule that allows both
user groups the access they need.
Mr. Mast. Would that include doing a Waterway Access
Management Study?
Admiral Fagan. The test deviation will create that data for
us. We will simultaneously--it will be a 6-month time period.
We will understand how many of the recreational users, and what
the train schedule is, and will work to incorporate that----
Mr. Mast [interrupting]. So, Mr. Chairman, just to be clear
here, I would ask your assistance in getting an answer. Would 1
hour out of 15 be considered not equitable? Can we at least
agree on that? That is not equitable, 1 out of 15 is not
equitable. Can you help me get an answer, Mr. Chairman?
Mr. Webster of Florida. No.
Mr. Mast. No?
Mr. Webster of Florida. No.
Mr. Mast. I am not surprised. Well, I am happy to keep
going. I am enjoying it. How about 2 hours? Would 2----
Mr. Webster of Florida [interrupting]. OK, time is expired.
Mr. Mast. OK. All right. You didn't say that before.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Auchincloss.
Mr. Auchincloss. Thank you, Chairman.
Admiral, welcome. Foreign Policy recently published an
article entitled, ``U.S. Coast Guard is Helping Southeast
Asians Protect Their Seas,'' which states that the economic
activities of all of Southeast Asia's waters are claimed as
coastal state jurisdictions, there is little the Coast Guard
can do to provide direct enforcement activities, and its
maritime security activities are pretty much limited to
capacity building and diplomatic actions.
We have seen elsewhere that the Coast Guard's assistance
with maritime surveillance and law enforcement in the Indo-
Pacific has solidified partnerships with nations in the region
as the Chinese Communist Party and the PLA look to militarize
the South China Sea and otherwise interdict eastbound
transpacific shipments.
How can the Coast Guard work with Southeast Asian allies or
nonallied nations to increase your presence and the utility of
your ships there?
Admiral Fagan. Thank you. We work closely with a number of
key partners and allies throughout the Indo-Pacific and
Oceania. One of the great benefits of the Coast Guard is our
people-to-people engagement beyond--and I will talk to the
large ships here in a minute.
Mobile and maritime training teams sent to a nation to help
them, whether it is small engine repair, learning how to repair
small engines, conduct fisheries operations in their own
exclusive economic zone, or ship rider agreements where we take
an individual from that nation--recently, Fiji would be an
example, we have a bilateral ship rider agreement with Fiji,
our ship in the area, a Fijian ship rider who brings their
authority and expertise. And so, there are a number of key
engagements that we do in the region.
We have asked for in the UPL--there is an ask for four
additional FRCs that would increase----
Mr. Auchincloss [interrupting]. FRCs?
Admiral Fagan. Fast Response Cutters, more persistent
presence into the Indo-Pacific theater as a signal of where
investment opportunities might be with regard to the Coast
Guard as we counter those threats.
Mr. Auchincloss. Good. Well, as someone who once commanded
a military-to-military training mission, I can attest that
those can have huge leverage in the host countries' forces and
training, and they can be highly effective.
What are you hearing from your sentinels overseas about the
reception that the Coast Guard is getting in these activities?
Admiral Fagan. The reception the Coast Guard gets is really
exceptional. There is a far greater demand for those kinds of
services than we have got capacity to provide. And it is not
just true in the Pacific. Off the coast of Africa, our European
partners and nation, this is one of the value propositions of
the Coast Guard, are those kinds of engagements and that kind
of partnership building.
Mr. Auchincloss. And are you working with or do you have a
conception of how you fit into the Marine Corps Force Design
2030 for their first island chain stand-in forces?
Admiral Fagan. So, we are part of the Maritime Force. Tri-
Service Maritime Strategy was jointly signed out by my
predecessor and the other Service Chiefs. We are committed to
being part of the maritime arm of the U.S. Government.
Mr. Auchincloss. And you support Force Design 2030?
Admiral Fagan. I am going to talk to it from the Coast
Guard's perspective, which is our contribution is in that
partnership capacity building. The work we do in the
competitive space, short of conflict, we field ships that are
operationally ready and at the same level of readiness as the
Navy, particularly as we operate in the Pacific.
Mr. Auchincloss. Final question for you also related to the
Indo-Pacific--slightly different, though. If I understand
correctly, Admiral, earlier in your career, you helped put
together the International Ship and Port Facility Code. Do you
see any ability for that code to be applied or updated to help
with ports screening for gray market or other illicit imports
of Russian oil in violation of the price cap that has been put
into place, particularly Indian ports?
Admiral Fagan. That is an interesting question. It is not
one that I have considered. We will come back to you on what
might be possible with regard to the current ISPS code and that
particular problem set.
Mr. Auchincloss. I would welcome your thoughts on that. It
sounds like you have got a rich history in working on it.
In the final 30 seconds, Master Chief, for you in terms of
workforce and recruitment, how much have you explored, given
this new generation's, maybe, skepticism of 30-year-long
careers in one organization, helping them envision the skills
that they get in just 4 to 5 years of working in the Coast
Guard, and how that can translate into the private sector. Is
that part of the value prop you are trying to put out there?
Master Chief Jones. Yes, sir. Thank you for that. And it
is--something that we talk to is, the same studies would tell
you that an older generation values that 30 years with one
company, the value that that leads, and that the younger
workforce coming in today likes something new and exciting
every few years.
What I talk to a lot is the fact that don't we, as the U.S.
Coast Guard, offer both? We offer the opportunity to come in
and have to do something new and exciting every few years, as
well as that invested into that 30- to 34-year career.
Mr. Auchincloss. I yield back, Chairman.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Ezell.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank
everybody for being here today.
I know the Coast Guard plays a vital role in hurricane
response and port security.
I am also proud of the work that the shipbuilding industry
does to modernize the fleet on the Mississippi gulf coast.
The Coast Guard continues to be asked to do more than ever.
I want to ensure that the 2024 budget addresses the concerns
with the security of our maritime borders, the challenges to
our national sovereignty in the Arctic, and the growing threats
in the Indo-Pacific.
Admiral Fagan, infrastructure continues to be an issue
within the Coast Guard. Does the Coast Guard have the resources
needed to replace aging and inadequate buildings, hangars, and
assets?
Admiral Fagan. Thank you. The infrastructure backlog needs
of the Service are well known. My predecessors have spoken to
them. The infrastructure investments reflected in the 2024
President's budget, coupled with our 2024 UPL, identified the
areas of infrastructure greatest need. It totals about $3
billion.
The organization, the force needs, reliable $400 to $500
million a year growth, 3 to 5 percent in that infrastructure
investment to begin to enable time for planning and then
execution in a way that allows investments for the new assets
coming online, and also updates the backlog of aging and older
infrastructure that we are operating some of the force from.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
Master Chief Jones, another issue--it is no secret, we have
talked about that a little bit--is the workforce. A 2022 GAO
study showed that the Coast Guard has a shortage of 400 marine
inspectors. This lack of a workforce has affected its ability
to conduct gas carrier compliance exams. The same report
recommended the Coast Guard conduct an assessment of adopting a
risk-based approach for conducting these exams.
Is the Coast Guard still experiencing a shortage of marine
inspectors, and do you believe the Coast Guard compliance
program would benefit from applying a risk-based approach for
petroleum and gas compliance exams?
Master Chief Jones. Mr. Congressman, across our workforce
in every community we have, we face a workforce shortage. There
is no one community that is 100 percent full, to include marine
inspectors. And we are applying a risk-based approach, where we
are starting to develop as we apply a risk-based approach to
how we staff our units to perform the multitude of missions.
Mr. Ezell. Very good. So, you believe it would be helpful
for Congress to make some changes to the law that would allow
the establishment and implementation of a risk-based program
for these inspectors to help address this issue?
Master Chief Jones. I would defer that expertise to
somewhere else in the Coast Guard for that answer, sir.
Mr. Ezell. Thank you, sir, for your willingness to testify.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Ranking Member Larsen, you are
recognized for some questions.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I
apologize for being late. I was on the floor, managing a piece
of legislation. So, we will see everyone at 5 o'clock for one
vote.
Admiral, good to see you again. We have talked a lot up at
the Academy, and I know that I have a lot of things to repeat
on that. But some things have happened since, including a
discussion here on Capitol Hill about reverting back to fiscal
year 2022 funding levels, which would have impact on a lot of
things in the budget. And I was curious if the Coast Guard has
done any analysis of what that would mean, if you had an fiscal
year 2022 funding level, versus what was proposed in the
President's budget?
Admiral Fagan. If we were held in a fiscal year 2022
funding level, we would start with a $500 million shortfall.
With inflation, increased costs, that immediately begins to
impact our ability to provide frontline operating services.
As we make budget choices and decisions, we prioritize that
frontline operating capacity for the Service. And so, an
ability to continue to field the major acquisitions, begin to
work through some of the infrastructure backlog, all of that
gets put at risk if we are held to a 2022 budget level. And
frankly, it impacts readiness almost immediately for the
Service.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes. So--but to put it another
way, you can't point to a specific thing, but the fact is, you
just will have that much less--fewer resources to do what we
are asking you to do today.
Admiral Fagan. We will be forced to make very difficult
tradeoffs. The investments, the acquisition investments, these
are step functions. You can't phase a little bit. It is an all
or nothing. And very quickly, we will be faced with difficult
tradeoffs, but we will work to preserve people, workforce, and
frontline operating capacity. But that all gets put into
question if we are held at that level.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, OK. Thank you. Thanks. And
then one of the questions I did ask is--and this impacts
Washington State, if I could be parochial, even though I am the
ranking member, if you don't mind, Mr. Chair--detrimental to
mariners across the country, but certainly in my district and
the State, is the crewing for the State ferry system and the
backlog of mariner credentialing.
It is a core responsibility of the Coast Guard, but there
wasn't money put in for a necessary upgrade to the system, so
that the credentialing activities can happen sooner. Can you
talk a little bit about what your plan is there?
Admiral Fagan. Yes, we take our role credentialing and
licensing mariners seriously. It is critical, not just to the
operation of the Washington State ferry system, but, frankly,
it is critical for national security that we have licensed and
credentialed mariners.
We have signaled some money needs in the UPL. We continue
to work forward to invest in a new state-of-the-art IT system,
which will bring some efficiency into that licensing and
credentialing. And we continue to move forward to be responsive
to that need.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. OK. And finally, I had a great
opportunity at the Academy to sit with many of your cadets,
including eight, I think, from the great State of Washington,
and I very much enjoyed it. But what struck me is that the
various groups on campus at the Academy, it is cadet-driven
discussions, and cadet-driven actions on the need for
diversity. It is not coming from the top. It is not coming--I
am sure you are supportive, but these are cadet-driven
activities who--they all recognize the need for a more diverse
workforce, and certainly a more diverse workforce within the
Coast Guard.
But still, there is a--probably now that we are catching up
to this, it is going to be a couple of years before that
diversity is reflected in the leadership. But how do you
foresee that diversity that exists clearly at the Academy
eventually working its way up into the broader leadership in
the U.S. Coast Guard to reflect the face of the United States?
Admiral Fagan. The Coast Guard Academy, you saw it when you
interacted with the cadets, we are about 45 percent women in
the cadet corps. And part of the reason that matters, one,
diverse workforces outperform nondiverse workforces.
One of the studies we have done recently reflected that
there had been a disparity rate between--graduation between men
and women graduates at the Coast Guard Academy. When we crossed
the 25-percent threshold, that disparity rate in graduation
diminished.
So, now, as an organization, and as I focus on workforce
management, talent management, it is in eliminating barriers
for those who have joined us to continue to serve: women,
minority males. What is good for women is good for the
workforce, and it creates opportunity for anyone that sees
themselves serving in the Coast Guard.
And I have got a sense of urgency around some of the human
relations talent management work that we have got in front of
us to ensure we retain that talent that is at the Academy.
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you.
And just one more note, if you don't mind, Mr. Chair.
Please apologize to Cadet King for the grilling I gave him
when I inspected his room, if he is recovered. I hope he has.
If he hasn't, I apologize.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you so much. I yield back.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Van Drew.
Dr. Van Drew. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank both of you
for being here. It is good to see both of you again.
And I just would tell the committee that we have a
wonderful relationship in Cape May with the Coast Guard. It is
integral and actually woven into the thread of our society in
Cape May County. And people truly do love you down there. And
it is good to see you again. And we are a Coast Guard
community, which is also a big deal down there, which is a
special designation given to certain communities, which we
appreciate.
So, my focus on this first round of questions today will be
on our continued investment in the United States Coast Guard
Training Center Cape May--and yes, I want to be a little
parochial, too--and the Coast Guard's new recruitment campaign.
My questions are directed both to the admiral and to the master
chief. Thank you both for your service to our country, by the
way.
In 2022, Congress appropriated $60 million to construct new
barracks at Training Center Cape May. Can you please provide a
status update on the design and on the engineering of the
barracks, and when we might expect to break ground on phase 1
of the project?
Admiral Fagan. Yes, thank you. We appreciate the enduring
support and all of the support that the community of Cape May
gives to us and our recruits as they go through our single
session source for our enlisted workforce.
And we are working to break ground, hopefully in late 2025,
on that first barracks project that we have been appropriated
for. The next priority after that is the multimission building.
And then there will be additional needs. We have done an
infrastructure development plan that will help to lay out the
way ahead for the investments that we need in Cape May, but we
should break ground on that barracks in late 2025.
Dr. Van Drew. Great. And everything seems to be going
pretty well?
Admiral Fagan. I have not heard otherwise; everything seems
to be on track. It is critical that we provide a safe, state-
of-the-art environment for our young recruits as they come
through that training program there, and we are looking forward
to it, to doing that for them.
Dr. Van Drew. Thank you. Last year, Congress authorized the
second phase of the barracks project for an additional $60
million. In the fiscal year 2024 budget request, the Coast
Guard also highlighted the need for an indoor training facility
at the training center. Both this committee and I have
supported appropriating these projects this fiscal year.
Can you please state your case for why these projects are
priorities for the Coast Guard and why Congress should move to
fund them now?
Admiral Fagan. Cape May is our sole entry point for the
enlisted force, and we owe them a safe environment to train and
become young Coast Guard members. The need for the multipurpose
training facility is really an acknowledgment to: it can get
very hot in Cape May, and it can get very cold in Cape May. And
40 percent of the year, those weather extremes impact our
ability to train. You can still run 1\1/2\ miles indoors in the
facility we have, but it is 90 laps around that gym. This is
not a state-of-the-art experience for young people that are
coming in to the world's best coast guard.
After the multipurpose building, barracks so that, again,
people have a safe, state-of-the-art place to sleep as they
work through their training.
Dr. Van Drew. And it is the only training center, correct?
Admiral Fagan. It is our only training----
Dr. Van Drew [interrupting]. In the country.
Admiral Fagan [continuing during interruption]. Force, yes.
Dr. Van Drew. In the United States of America.
Admiral Fagan. The Navy operates a similar facility in the
Great Lakes, but this is our sole source.
Dr. Van Drew. OK, thank you. Finally, I would like to give
you the opportunity to speak on the Coast Guard's new
``Protect, Defend, and Save'' campaign. Can you please describe
how this is different from past recruitment efforts, what the
changes are?
Admiral Fagan. The Protect, Defend, Save, and the new logo,
it is a tertiary logo. There is no intent to change the shield,
the anchor and shield, the racing stripe, the iconic----
Dr. Van Drew [interrupting]. That was the concern, right?
Admiral Fagan. No, those are primary and secondary symbols
that will remain and really speak to the core of our heritage
and who we are.
The new symbol is targeted to young people, the 18- to 25-
year-olds who we are looking to recruit. We did a lot of
marketing towards that group of people with that particular
symbol. As we have gained support for marketing dollars,
advertising dollars, we are going to the young people on gaming
websites and other--this is not a large commercial on night-
time TV. That is not where the young people are. And so, that
symbol--a more focused targeting of our advertising dollars and
strategic dollars, it is really designed at the workforce we
are trying to recruit.
Dr. Van Drew. Is there anything you would like to see in
the next authorization to help with recruitment?
Admiral Fagan. We appreciate the support that we have
continued to get, and will continue to signal where our
investment needs are. Increasing recruiter capacity, opening
recruiting offices, expanding the JROTC program, marketing and
reaching young people where they are are all things that we
have had support on, and will likely need additional support,
and appreciate what the committee has been doing.
Dr. Van Drew. Thank you.
I yield back, Chairman.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Ms. Scholten.
Ms. Scholten. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Admiral Fagan, Master Chief Jones, thank you so much for
joining us here today.
I represent miles of beautiful Lake Michigan shoreline that
has an installation of the U.S. Coast Guard in Muskegon and
Grand Haven. I recently had a chance to tour the facility. It
was great speaking with the members and understanding a little
bit more about the challenges that come with serving, including
a 50-year-old cutter and drysuits desperately in need of
replacing. The issues highlight the need for a robust Coast
Guard budget to ensure our Coast Guard's men and women have
what they need to keep people safe.
Another issue that Station Grand Haven highlighted was
recruitment and retention. While this was before my time in
Congress, one thing that I understand had a severe impact on
the ability to recruit and retain was the 2019 partial
Government shutdown. Master Chief Jones, how severely were
Coast Guard families, particularly the enlisted members,
affected by the 35-day shutdown? I understand the impact was
fairly severe, but if you can talk to what it did for morale
amongst servicemembers, knowing that they weren't going to be
able to support their families, the uncertainty of that month,
particularly while the other branches of the military were
being paid?
Master Chief Jones. Thank you for that question,
Congresswoman. It had a severe impact on the morale of the
workforce.
More concerning is the potential mission impact that it
has. When our sentinels come to work every day, if they know
that things are taken care of at home, and they know that their
families are safe and secure, they are able to focus on the job
at hand and be more mission effective. And it was a tremendous
impact.
We learned that one thing that will take our workforce to
its knees is the unknown, and that unknown is what was scary
for them.
Ms. Scholten. And do you continue to see it have an impact
on recruitment and retention today, particularly around the
stability issues?
Master Chief Jones. I don't know if I could draw a parallel
to that to our recruitment today. I think in the immediate
aftermath, it may have, but I cannot tell you definitively
whether it does today or not.
Ms. Scholten. Yes. One thing that we know is that stability
is so important to the mission all around. Thank you for
answering that question.
Today Representative Gonzalez-Colon and I will be
reintroducing the Pay Our Coast Guard Parity Act of 2023,
previously introduced by former Chair Peter DeFazio during the
2019 shutdown. This bill would ensure that the Coast Guard
continues to be paid if other branches of the military are paid
in the event of a shutdown.
Protecting our Nation both at home and on our coasts
overseas, away from their families, is critical. Coast Guard
members continued to show up every day for those 35 days,
despite not knowing if their paycheck would be coming. For 35
days, almost 1,000 families did not receive childcare
subsidies. Death benefits were not paid to survivors of Coast
Guard members who died while on Active Duty. And leasing for
personnel housing--you mentioned earlier one of the most
critical issues for Coast Guard men and women in Government-
leased housing--were not paid. This simply cannot stand, and we
are taking action to stop it. Thank you.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am happy to
be here today. And yes, I am proud to be joining Congresswoman
Scholten to introduce that bill, so, I am happy that she
brought it down today.
I want to say thank you, Admiral Fagan and Master Chief--it
is great to see you both--and, of course, the men and women who
are part of the Coast Guard. And thank you for your service to
our Nation.
In the case of Puerto Rico, we are no strangers to the
Coast Guard's important role and mission, and we truly value
the relationship with our Coasties at Sector San Juan, and all
they do to keep us safe.
So, I want to focus on one of the issues that I am really
concerned about, and that is specifically the maritime border
security issues, specifically to the waters of Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands. Over the last few years, we have seen
an increase in drug and migrant activity around our islands.
In fiscal year 2022, the Coast Guard interdicted more than
2,300 migrants in the Mona Passage in the waters near Puerto
Rico, a 200-percent increase when compared to fiscal year 2021
for the same area. And according to the data the Coast Guard
shared with my office from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year
2020, the known cocaine flow to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands, either coming directly from South America or via the
Dominican Republic, increased 115 percent, from 51 metric tons
to 110 metric tons.
We have also seen a rise in violence associated with these
events. In a recent Homeland Security Committee hearing, CBP
AMO executive director of operations testified that Puerto Rico
is now--I would like to quote him--``the most violent maritime
threat vector of any location we patrol.''
And as you are probably aware, last November, a CBP marine
interdiction agent was shot and killed and two others were
gravely injured during an interdiction of a drug smuggling
vessel off of the western coast of Puerto Rico. Just 2 months
later, another gunfight during a vessel interdiction off the
coast of Fajardo in the eastern part of the island resulted in
the death of two drug smugglers.
And the reason I bring those issues here is just to
highlight the significant threats we face in the Caribbean area
from transnational criminal organizations and smugglers
operating in the Caribbean, and the need to ensure a robust
Coast Guard and Federal law enforcement presence in the region.
For example, recently the island has been advocating for the
Coast Guard to establish a formal permanent presence on the
island, western and eastern part of the island, through new
boat stations or sub-units. I think this is something we should
look at closely.
And my question today will be, could you discuss the Coast
Guard efforts to tackle transnational threats and smuggling
activity in waters in the Caribbean jurisdiction, including
whether any consideration has been given to deploy additional
assets in the region or establish a formal presence in those
areas beyond the current boat station in San Juan?
Admiral Fagan. Thank you. And we are absolutely committed
to countering the TCOs and the illegal flows of drugs and
migrants. And, certainly, as you have highlighted, the flows
have changed as with regard to what is coming towards Puerto
Rico.
We are working to build a more robust capacity at Base San
Juan, which is a key hub for the region, and as we support
ships and boats and aircraft. We have got Fast Response Cutters
now in Puerto Rico. Those are newer assets, game changing for
us in the vectors that you have talked about; fielding the new
MH-60 helicopters we have talked about earlier; and boats, as
well. And we look forward to continuing to work with you and
our team at D7 to ensure that the Coast Guard assets are
appropriately postured for the risk.
As risks change, often it is much more dynamic than we are
able--and so, we will move ships and boats towards where the
increased threat may be. We do that in the Florida Straits now,
and we will continue to do that to ensure that Puerto Rico has
the appropriate level of maritime safety and security that the
Coast Guard can provide.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you. And one of the last
questions that I have is that, according to the most recent
annual performance report, the Coast Guard was only able to
remove 5.4 percent of the total known cocaine flow in the
maritime transit zone, well below the target of 10 percent. And
those numbers are coming down. What is the biggest challenge
the Coast Guard is confronting that prevents it from meeting
the target drug removal rate, and has the increase in migrant
activities impacted that resource?
Admiral Fagan. It is a team effort, the counternarcotics
effort. As we move to field the new ship assets that will be
more reliable, the new helicopter assets that will be more
reliable, it will help us stay on station more reliably.
Now, we experience unplanned maintenance days that take us
off vector, and we are focused on the lifesaving work that we
are doing in the maritime migration, particularly in the
Florida Straits. Thank you.
Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you.
Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Let's see. Mrs. Peltola.
Mrs. Peltola. Thank you, Chairman Webster.
Good afternoon. It is very good to meet both of you. Thank
you for being here. I am the Member representing the State of
Alaska, which, I don't have to tell you how enormous Alaska is,
or all of the good work that you do there, especially with
search and rescue and, really, just being a national security
presence. And I know that that is not really your wheelhouse,
but I think your presence is really critical in Alaska, with
our adversaries being so close, and I understand doing missions
in our waters, practice missions in our waters, so, I really
appreciate all the work that you are doing.
Master Chief Jones, the fiscal year 2024 budget proposal
includes--and I apologize if this question has already been
asked--it includes an increase of 80 positions, 42 full-time
positions, and $15.5 million to enhance retention and support
of your workforce. And I just was wondering if you could
provide some more details on that budget proposal.
Master Chief Jones. Thank you for that question,
Congresswoman.
Those positions, we were investing in shore-based personnel
that support our cutter operations for our maintenance assist
teams and our weapons assist teams.
We are investing in bolstering our modern training
capability to where we--sometimes the best training is brick
and mortar, sometimes it is delivered in a virtual format. It
is delivering the training that the units need on time where
they are for the mission they are addressing.
We are continuing our efforts to transition to our
electronic health record, which is a welcome transition, as
well as those funds also fund the special trial counsel that
was directed as per the 2022 NDAA.
Mrs. Peltola. OK. Thank you. Thank you so much. I am
wondering if either one of you could answer what the Coast
Guard is doing now to ensure mental health of your workforce
and how that is reflected in your budget.
Admiral Fagan. We continue to invest in medical capacity to
improve access for mental healthcare. At every unit we visit,
at every all-hands, the concern over access to mental
healthcare is raised by our members and by their families.
We have signed an MOU with DoD to improve our access to
mental health capacity and training for our own medical
corpsmen. We have a Coast Guard support system, but we are
working to update that contract so that it provides easier
access for telehealth and mental screening, particularly around
mental health. And we continue to leverage all tools that are
available to us, and invest in the capacity that is needed to
ensure the mental and emotional well-being of our force.
Mrs. Peltola. OK. The last thing I wanted to mention, there
is a young man who serves as a AET-2 who wanted to remain
anonymous, but I just wanted to share some sentiments that he
shared with me. He said that, under your leadership, there has
been an increase in baby leave for both parents for up to 3
months. There have been funds allocated for new childcare
centers, and you have made it possible for new members with
degrees to come into the Coast Guard at a higher rank. And the
last sentiment here is that you are truly taking a new approach
and changing things for the better.
So, I really want to commend you and your very professional
team, and all the good work that you are doing for our Nation.
Thank you so much.
Admiral Fagan. Thank you.
Mrs. Peltola. I yield my time back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you. So, we have time for a
little bit more questions, so, I will ask the first.
Master Chief, like other Services, the Coast Guard has
fallen short--we have been talking about that--of recruiting
targets of approximately 4,800 members. What is the major
problem you see in enlisted ranks in the deficit of nearly 20
percent expected by 2025?
Master Chief Jones. Mr. Chairman, the major issue is just
that the mission hasn't gone away. The mission is always there.
And our sentinels each and every day are dedicated to getting
the mission done. And we need more people to help them get that
mission done to ease the burden on each individual person.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Can you talk about some of the ways
the Coast Guard is working to attract qualified personnel,
other than the ones that have been mentioned?
Master Chief Jones. Yes, sir. As the Commandant spoke to,
it is investing in how we advertise. We are advertising in
different ways, meeting people where they are for the workforce
that we are trying to attract, getting into gaming communities,
which is a large portion of the young generation that is out
there, attracting them.
And what we are really doing internal to the Coast Guard
with the workforce is really and truly a push to simply tell
our story. What we have learned is when people learn about the
United States Coast Guard, they want to be part of the United
States Coast Guard. They see the value we offer. They truly
fall in love with our mission. They are passionate about doing
it.
We just have to do a better job of telling our story. And
that is one charge that I have given to our chiefs throughout
the Coast Guard, and I have given to each and every sentinel
every day is to tell the story when--they are already out in
the communities. They are involved in their communities. They
are doing great things every day in their communities. And I
ask them to almost not be quite so humble sometimes, to get out
there and tell everybody, ``Here is what I do every single
day,'' and I think that story will help us resonate.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Do you think the deficit in any way
affects--how does it affect the readiness and the ability to
perform the mission?
Master Chief Jones. Just with the simple numbers. Like I
said, we need more people to help us. But what I will tell you
is--and we get to see this everywhere we go--the quality of
people we have coming in through Training Center Cape May and
the quality of people we have coming through New London are
second to none. They are absolutely the best of what our
country offers. We just have to double down on efforts to find
more of them to come through.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Good testimony. OK, Mr. Mast.
Mr. Mast. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman.
Master Chief, you just spoke about telling a story. And I
have nothing but love for the Coast Guard men and women in my
community. But I am going to tell you a story about what has
been happening with Washington, DC, Coast Guard and Coast Guard
Sector Miami.
Just now, ma'am, you committed to an equitable process, but
you are unwilling to even acknowledge situations that would be
not equitable at all, that literally just happened. Your folks
from DC came into my office and made some of the most unfounded
statements that anybody could make. They said, ``Well, we
believe that if we gave your boaters a 15-minute access to that
waterway, they could squeeze 75 boats through that waterway in
15 minutes.'' Truly one of the most unfounded statements that--
and when I told anybody back in my community that statement,
every one of them, their response was the exact same. They were
using some version of swear words to say, ``What in the world
are they thinking about that?''
You all put forward a questionnaire about management of
this waterway in which you asked, ``Is a 15-minute hourly
opening schedule sufficient for the community?'' You didn't ask
if 45 minutes would be sufficient for the community. You only
asked if 15 minutes would be acceptable to the community.
You took the Waterway Access Management Study, something
that was very substantial, done with a great amount of purpose,
and you all said that you want to ignore the recommendations
that are in that. That is a part of the story of the Coast
Guard in my community right now.
I want to try some of these questions again for a moment.
Maybe you will answer them.
If the Coast Guard--because the Coast Guard is deciding
this--decides that they are going to say, ``Brightline train,
you can close down that waterway for 14 hours of a 15-hour
window, and community that lives around there, you can have 1
hour of the 15 hours,'' would that be equitable?
Admiral Fagan. I am committed to a full and transparent
process. We need to let the data speak to understand how to
ensure both users are able----
Mr. Mast [interrupting]. Ma'am, you are ignoring your own
data, are you not? You are ignoring the Waterway Access
Management Study that you all did.
Admiral Fagan. The----
Mr. Mast [interrupting]. Yes or no? Yes or no?
Admiral Fagan. I am not familiar with that study. I will--
--
Mr. Mast [interrupting]. You are familiar with this case,
but you are not familiar with the study that you all did on it.
Let that tell you about where the process is.
You won't look at the stuff--you knew you were coming in
here, you knew that I was going to ask about this, and you are
not familiar with the study that you all did? Think about that.
And you are telling me that you are going to do a study,
but where are you getting the information from? Your folks told
us. You are getting your information from the train company.
You are not even getting your own information.
After your folks told us, ``No, listen, we are going to
ignore this study because we are going to do another study that
is more recent. We want more accurate information.'' But you
all changed your tune and you said, no, you are not going to do
that, you are just going to get the information from the train.
Now, I have talked about the 32 trains that the Brightline
is going to run. Again, it doesn't even count the 15 freight
trains that already go over those tracks every single day. So,
now you are talking about, what, 47 trains a day going over
that bridge, largely in a 15-hour window of time, taking no
less than 18 minutes. I was in the Army, but I can do simple
Army math, and I can tell you that only leaves about 30 minutes
of access for mariners in that community with those kind of
numbers. Is that equitable?
Admiral Fagan. We have a public comment process. I am
committed to taking in all of the data, all of the public
comments, and----
Mr. Mast [interrupting]. And was that public comment
process where you all put forward skewed questions? And you
even acknowledged that they were skewed questions, and went
back and changed them because you acknowledged that they were
skewed. That is not a fair and equitable process.
So, let's just try it one more time. Can you acknowledge
that any situation of time management between the local
community that you are looking at up there and the train
company would be inequitable? Is there any version that you
could say, listen, that would reach the level of not equitable
for the community?
Admiral Fagan. I am committed to access for both user
groups, and will work with you and our team----
Mr. Mast [interrupting]. But access is not equitable.
Having access is not being equitable. Having access, great. You
got to come out on the waterway, you got some time there. You
got 15 minutes out of an hour to get through there. That is not
the same thing as equitable, ma'am.
And Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the time.
Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Van Drew.
Dr. Van Drew. My second round of questions will focus on
offshore wind and maritime navigation safety.
In 2011, the Coast Guard established the Atlantic Coast
Port Access Route Study Workgroup. The group was to determine
whether the Coast Guard should create navigational fairways to
mitigate maritime safety impacts of anticipated offshore energy
leases.
In 2012, the workgroup published an interim report stating
that they were ``developing tools critical to evaluating the
navigational safety risk resulting from different scenarios.''
Admiral Fagan, do you stand by the Coast Guard's 2012
assessment that the tools and recommendations of the Port
Access Route Study are important to mitigating navigational
safety risk?
Admiral Fagan. I am committed to a predictable, safe,
transparent way forward. I acknowledge the frustration in the
length of time it has taken for the rulemaking to come to
completion, and we are working to do exactly that.
I am committed to fulfilling our responsibility to preserve
safety of navigation as we work to balance the offshore wind
energy leases, and safe, transparent operation of the fleet of
vessels that also enjoy access offshore. And we are working
hard to get the notice of proposed rulemaking over the finish
line.
Dr. Van Drew. It is not easy. The Coast Guard's modeling
concluded in the fall of 2014, but ``did not produce a model
capable of determining the risk to navigational safety,'' which
you know already.
As of 2014, there was still work to be done in developing a
safety plan. In November--this is a timeline; if I go too
quick, stop me. In November of 2015, the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, BOEM, auctioned two lease areas off the coast of
New Jersey to offshore wind energy developers. They finalized
this lease on February 4, 2016, and it went into effect on
March 1st of that year. It was only on March 14th of that year,
of 2016, that the Coast Guard published the final rule for the
Port Access Study.
Admiral Fagan, did BOEM select that lease area auction
itself and put that lease area into effect before the U.S.
Coast Guard finalized its Atlantic Coast Port Access Route
Study Safety Recommendations?
Admiral Fagan. We have an advisory role with BOEM. I will
ask the staff to come out. I don't have the step-by-step
process. I am committed to the process, committed to being
responsive and transparent in that process. And I will ask the
staff----
Dr. Van Drew [interrupting]. This is--just so you know, I
am not trying to catch you or anybody on this, but that study
should have been done before the lease was done to make sure it
is appropriate to do what they want to do.
Specifically on the timeline, is this timeline accurate
based on the dates that I described to you? And what you are
telling me is you are going to have to go back and look.
Admiral Fagan. Yes, I want to make sure I give you a
technically accurate answer with regard to----
Dr. Van Drew [interrupting]. If BOEM decided to auction--
and this is why this is so important--if BOEM decided to
auction the New Jersey offshore wind leases before the Coast
Guard finalized its recommendations--no criticism of you, but
if they did, it is them I am looking at--then it is impossible
that BOEM fully considered safety in their leasing decisions.
And that is obvious; if they did this before you were done, how
can they do that?
And in all honesty, this means that the offshore wind
leases off the coast of New Jersey are actually illegal. And
there is a real possibility here. Again, nothing on the Coast
Guard. I just want to know the dates. And we have checked this
out and investigated.
The fact will be of little comfort to the projects that are
constructed. Navigating offshore wind will be difficult and
dangerous. Both BOEM and the Coast Guard have determined that
the offshore wind projects will--and I am quoting both the
Coast Guard and BOEM--``potentially increase frequency of
collision as shipping traffic maneuvers around offshore wind
development.'' And that is a quote from both. The Coast Guard
stated this direct in its Atlantic Coast Port Access Route
Study, and it is in there. I have looked at it with my own
eyes.
Can you confirm the Coast Guard's determination that
offshore wind structures present potentially dangerous risks to
maritime operators, a conclusion reached in recent Coast Guard
Port Access Route studies?
Admiral Fagan. Any time a fixed structure is put into the
sea, it increases the potential for risk with ships and
movement. Our role is to continue to ensure access and
navigation, safety of navigation. We will continue to work to
advise in that realm----
Dr. Van Drew [interrupting]. But it is a challenge. I mean,
this is over 3,000 wind turbines, and it is over 2 million
acres. I mean, this is a big project that is going to affect us
forever. So, I would appreciate if you could get back to me
with those specifics.
I will think you will find that everything I told you was
accurate, which is problematic for this company that went
forward before they knew whether it would be safe or not, or
what the ramifications would be.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Thank you for your time.
Mr. Webster of Florida. That concludes the hearing for
today. Thank you to the witnesses for appearing. We appreciate
that and look forward to talking to you in the future.
I ask unanimous consent that the record be open for 15
days.
[Whereupon, at 3:49 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

----------

Questions from Hon. Salud O. Carbajal to Admiral Linda L. Fagan,
Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard

Question 1. Admiral Fagan, during the hearing I asked about the
status of regulations for the new sexual assault and sexual harassment
provisions in the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022 and
the long overdue Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act. Please provide
clarity to the timeframe mentioned at the hearing including as to when
are you starting.
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 1 (con't). In addition, please answer the following
questions:
Question 1.a. If you need outside consultation, who are you
consulting with?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 1.b. Do you think your rulemaking will delay the
statutorily mandated timeline for vessel implementation?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 1.c. Can vessel operators move forward with confidence
that their technology will comply?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2. The MH-60s require more personnel to operate than other
USCG helicopters. Will the USCG have enough personnel to operate an all
MH-60 fleet?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 3. Can the MH-60 operate on ALL of the USCG ships? Does it
fit in all of the USCG land and ship hangars? If not, what are the USCG
plans for those ships and air station hangers that cannot accommodate
the MH-60 helicopter?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 4. Do both the MH-60 and the USCG's Unmanned Aircraft
System (UAS), ScanEagle, fit on board USCG ships together? Has the
National Security Cutter deployed and operated with a MH-60 helicopter
and ScanEagle UAS? If not, what equipment will be left onshore and what
would be the impact to a cutter that is not fully mission capable?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 5. Occasionally aviation fleets are grounded due to safety
or maintenance concerns. Does the USCG have a plan to cover all
statutory missions Coast Guard helicopters are used to support if the
single helicopter fleet is grounded?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Questions from Hon. Brian Babin to Admiral Linda L. Fagan, Commandant,
U.S. Coast Guard

Question 1. As the Coast Guard looks to transition to an MH-60
rotary-wing fleet, I understand that the Coast Guard is slowly phasing
out many of its aging MH-65s, with the intention of reducing its
overall rotary wing fleet from 146 to 126 aircraft.
Air Station Houston currently hosts three MH-65 ``Dolphin''
helicopters, and I understand the current plan is to phase these three
helicopters out and replace them with just two MH-60's.
While I recognize that the MH-60 is a very capable platform
compared with the MH-65, I have concerns that reducing the number of
airframes in service may impact the Coast Guard's operational
capabilities.
Presumably, with fewer aircraft at an air station, it would be more
challenging to respond to multiple search and rescue missions, drug
interdictions, or patrols, given that a single helicopter can only be
in one place at one time.
I don't anticipate drug runners will idle their boats while they
wait for helicopters, and we can't ask folks to just tread water while
they await assistance. Given that reality, how does the Coast Guard
plan to maintain its operational capabilities with less operational
assets?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2. In a report shared with the Committee last May
regarding the Coast Guard's Interdiction of Illicit Drugs in Transit
Zones, the report shares that the Coast Guard was able to intercept
about 10 percent of the cocaine flow coming into the United States.
In the report, the Coast Guard notes that the ``level of effort
toward this mission is assessed as adequate, given the boundary
conditions of balancing the execution of other statutory missions and
workforce and material readiness.''
I assume the Coast Guard is not satisfied with a 10 percent
interdiction rate. My takeaway from that is you have too few resources
to adequately carry out your growing mission set.
Question 2.a. What are some of the factors that would improve the
Coast Guard's ability to carry out its drug interdiction mission?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2.b. Would you acknowledge that additional surface assets
could help the Coast Guard improve its mission effectiveness? And if
so, why does the President's Budget not include resources for
additional FRCs?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 3. The Coast Guard and Navy are planning to invest up to
$11.8 billion to build and maintain three Polar Security Cutter heavy
polar icebreakers to conduct missions in the Antarctic and Arctic. The
first ship is ``scheduled'' for delivery in 2025-2026, but is expected
to be delivered, at best, in 2028.
Can you provide a status update on our icebreakers? What is being
done to address continued delays in completing the design of the Polar
Security Cutters to begin construction?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Questions from Hon. Jefferson Van Drew to Admiral Linda L. Fagan,
Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard

Question 1. May you provide a detailed timeline of activities which
occurred under the Atlantic Coast Port Access Route Study from 2011 to
2016?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 2. On what dates did USCG communicate both preliminary and
final conclusions and recommendations of the Atlantic Coast Port Access
Route Study to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 3. Did the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's November
2015 auction for the New Jersey Wind Energy Area, as well as the
finalization of the lease area on March 1st, occur chronologically
before the U.S. Coast Guard finalized the Atlantic Coast Port Access
Route Study on March 14th of 2016?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 4. May you provide an account of interagency
communications and coordination between USCG and BOEM from 2011-2016
related to the New Jersey Wind Energy Area?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question 5. When does USCG anticipate the finalization of the
Delaware Bay PARS?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Question from Hon. Brian Babin to Master Chief Heath B. Jones, Master
Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard, U.S. Coast Guard

Question 1. Master Chief, the Coast Guard faces recruiting
challenges, most notably in its enlisted ranks. Can you talk about some
of the lessons learned from other services in addressing this
challenge? What is the Coast Guard doing to improve its recruiting
efforts?
Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.
